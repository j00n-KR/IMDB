0,MartinHafer,An absolute must for anyone who considers themselves a film buff,10,13 April 2007,"This is one of the greatest films ever made...period. Much of this can be attributed to the exceptional writing and much of this can be attributed to the amazing performances in one of the best ensemble casts in film history. In fact, anyone who considers themselves a film buff or a serious student of film cannot say so unless they have seen this film. I also wish all young directors and writers were forced to watch the film as it demonstrates the power of excellent writing and acting. Imagine...a film that is great that does NOT have special effects, was filmed in black and white, and 99% of which takes place in one small room.Aside from Henry Fonda, all the other actors are a virtual ""who's who"" of supporting character actors from the 1950s--and all were at the top of their game in this film. Unfortunately, the film has been parodied and copied so many times that the film's originality has been blunted. Oddly, one of the parodies of this plot came from the TV show ""The Odd Couple""--which starred Jack Klugman who was ALSO in 12 ANGRY MEN! See this film. And, if it turns out you don't like it, then I suggest you see a psychiatrist!!!",12 Angry Men
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant!!",10,10 June 2010,"There are a few wonderful courtroom dramas out there, Anatomy of a Murder, To Kill a Mockingbird and Witness for the Prosecution immediately springing to mind. 12 Angry Men is so brilliant, it could very well be the definitive courtroom drama on film. Sidney Lumet's direction is masterly, and although the action takes place on one set(an actual New York drawing room) there are a huge variety of innovative camera angles and visual set-ups. The screenplay is sophisticated and smart, and the story is compelling and intelligent. The film is also brilliantly made, and the acting is superb. Henry Fonda especially dominates the film, with an integrity that makes his character so wonderful, but the other actors are wonderful as well, Ed Begley, Jack Warden, John Fiedler, Lee J Cobb, Rudy Bond et al. are all impeccable support to Fonda. Overall, brilliant courtroom drama. 10/10 Bethany Cox",12 Angry Men
2,bkoganbing,A Very Flawed classic,6,3 September 2005,"When I was younger I thought 12 Angry Men was a near perfect ensemble film with a great group of male players. At that time in those sexist fifties women had an automatic out from jury duty. It was not unusual to have all male juries as we have here.Then I served on a few juries and my concepts changed. One of the key scenes of the film is when Henry Fonda produces a switchblade knife exactly like the weapon the young perpetrator allegedly used in the stabbing death of his father. The second that Fonda produced that knife, someone should have yelled for a mistrial.In all 50 states of the United States of America, a standard jury instruction is that the jury is to decide the guilt or innocence of a defendent on the evidence presented at trial. Jurors are free to come and go until they are sequestered for the verdict. But they are instructed not to go near the crime scene or gather ANY independent evidence. I remember being on jury duty and assigned on a case where the crime took place in an apartment that was one block away from one of two routes to a BMT subway stop that took me to work. And those same subways also took me to downtown Brooklyn and the court house. I made it a point to take the IRT to court for the next two weeks while the trial went on to avoid the temptation of going over to the crime scene.It was a great dramatic effect, but totally at odds with our legal system. I can't believe that something that elementary was left in a film that was purported to be a realistic look at jury deliberations.The juries I was on did debate and in some cases quibble over all the points of the trial. They were a good cross section of the breed Brooklynus Americanus just as in 12 Angry Men. If you watch Law and Order you know how hard the prosecutors job is to get 12 people to convict.Still it's a wonderful group of players that participated here. Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb are the biggest names in the cast. But others like Robert Webber, John Fiedler, Martin Balsam, and Jack Klugman got their first real notice in this film.Jack Klugman's portrayal was a particular favorite of mine among the group. He's from the same slum background as the defendent and some of the knowledge he has from that environment makes for the most compelling argument for the defendent's innocence. We should be thankful that Sidney Lumet assembled and directed the find cast he did.",12 Angry Men
3,SnoopyStyle,a movie for actors,7,18 April 2016,"In a NYC courtroom, a first degree murder case against a poor 18 year old boy with a troubled history has just rested. The 12 men of the jury are sent to decide the seemingly open and shut case. They hold a vote and it's 11-1 guilty. Henry Fonda is the only not-guilty vote. He's not sure and wants to spend time discussing the case.This is the classic stage play. I say this meaning it's a bunch of characters in a room. The characters don't even have names. Lee J. Cobb and Jack Warden have the flashiest roles. Henry Fonda is essentially the lead as the central heroic role. He has the nobility. The roles are all filled with first rate character actors. This is an actor's movie. The only drawback is the cinematic potential. In the end, it is 12 men around a table in a room. The visual opportunities are limited. Despite that, the debate interplay is engrossing and the movie is satisfying.",12 Angry Men
4,Hitchcoc,It Blends Together,10,17 February 2006,"This movie came out of an era that I really loved, when ensemble acting was so strong. We had a whole group of character actors who really took seriously the smaller roles that they had. The direction by Sidney Lumet on this film is outstanding. To take the Henry Fonda character from the meek, inconsequential juror, simply putting forth a theory, to watching the other men slowly see his way of thinking, is subtlety at its best. Lee J. Cobb does his burn, done in by impatience and inconvenience. Pusing an agenda that fits only him. Underlying the entire plot is the defendant whom we never see but get to know through a slow, methodical, yet fascinating series of revelations. It's quiet, suspenseful, and human. It's the true whodunnit without Hercule Poirot. This is the element that is most obvious; that 12 men can sit in a single room for the entire movie and interact and still keep us totally occupied. Enough has been said about this. I just wish that contemporary film making could take a bit more from these masterpieces; let the fine actors that we have do their individual things.",12 Angry Men
5,mark.waltz,One of the great theatrical examples of what makes for superb drama.,10,20 March 2017,"Theater at its best is practically impossible to get down on film correctly. When Hollywood gets it right, they create a work of art. In this case, they did it simply, without frills, casting actors who looked real and fell into their individual parts like kids into a swimming pool on a hot summers day. It's the hottest day of the year, and these twelve men must decide the fate of an accused killer. But twelve men means twelve personalities, twelve temperaments, twelve political views, twelve religious opinions and twelve preconceived notions. As the temperature swells, so does the temperament. Having been a very reluctant jury foreman, I find myself seeing eye to eye with the shyness of the man forced to lead the proceedings. Everybody looks at you to get the ball rolling and hopefully get out of there as quickly as possible. Martin Balsam, as the foreman, tries to remain dignified and not be overly in control, losing that to one of the jurors who looks at the case in a completely different way than the others. Twelve personalities means plenty of neuroses, and in a very short time, seeing what's really going on in the minds of strangers whom you'll never see again.This trial involves young John Sacova, accused of killing his own father, and the twelve men must decide whether he gets the chair or not. These men, only identified through their juror number, are completely different, and it's obvious from the start that some of them (John Fiedler in particular) vote guilty because they think they have to. Only one (Henry Fonda) votes not guilty, and of course, one of them says, ""There's always one."" There are the aggressive ones certain of guilt, empathetic ones who would like to see the charges reduced, and those who view all young people from certain areas as scum regardless of their situation. At 60 years old, this film shows the same prejudices we face today, yet shows that there is always someone not about to follow the crowd simply because something strikes them as off. It is Fonda who will pretty much control the room, although he does it in a subtle way where nobody realizes that he's pretty much taken over.While jury's have changed in 60 years (allowing women to serve being the most obvious change), what hasn't changed in the conflict of trying to understand the truth and to agree with 11 other people about it. Fonda goes against what would be allowed today by acting on his own and visiting the neighborhood of the crime, but his passion in figuring out the truth is very admirable. He is quiet in his determination, making this typical Fonda but one that fills his soul with humility and integrity.Under the direction of novice Sidney Lumet, the entire cast is outstanding. Familiar faces from all walks of show business each get their chance to shine. Jack Klugman, Ed Begley, E.G. Marshall, Jack Warden, to name a few. I could easily write something about each of them, but it's worth checking them all out yourself. The one juror who really makes an impression in creating his character is Lee J. Cobb as the very aggressive juror who is hiding behind similarities to the case, having had a contentious relationship with his son that sparks his instant sense that the defendant is guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt. He was deservedly nominated for a Golden Globe (as was Fonda), but the Oscars only acknowledged the film, director and script for nominations. Each jury is its own story, and from city to city, nothing changes but the type of case and the date.",12 Angry Men
6,kosmasp,Classic in every sense and moment and frame,10,21 October 2019,"I could go on, but I thought I'd stop there before my summary line gets too big. Now just because this is a classic movie (and we really should try to use that term lightly, but this movie really deserves it and I'll elaborate on that), does not mean everybody will love it. And if one does not like it, it does not mean they have no taste. They just have different tastes, which is a good thing, because if every human on earth would have the same taste, life would be very boring now wouldn't it? The asnwer is yes, in case you were wondering.But back to this, which begins outside and takes us inside. And it is important that we were outside because we will live inside a building (a room to be more specific) for the most time. There is also a brief shot of the alleged culprit/criminal. After that we get in a room with 12 men, who are quite different from each other. And while it wasn't yet time to give African American a chance in a movie like that (or Asian American for that matter), there is a critical racial line that is drawn. If you follow what is happening and who says what or argues in certain ways, you will see that this movie has quite the social commentary in it.Now that is one part of this being genius, because it never rubs your nose in it. It never says, this guy who is i.e. from Italian descent has a reasonable thing/argument to say. No you just hear the things and see the people interact. And I have not even mentioned the way the movie is shot. And I'm not talking about the black and white cinematography (which is beautifully lit), no. I mean the framing and the set-ups. the editing and how everything flows. You feel like you're inside the room. You feel like this really happens or happened. Even the things that seem not staged (someone blocking another person, a shadow, peoples back and more) are in fact staged and masterfully done so.There are way smarter people than me, that can list you many things this movie has done right and I'm sure there quite a few sources online to look for. Just listening to the audio commentary can give a small glimpse into certain things too. But again, since this is not something that one might call light entertaining, if it does not appeal to you, then it is so. It does not mean you are wrong and it surely does not mean that this movie is falsely considered a masterpiece!",12 Angry Men
7,classicsoncall,"""You can't send someone off to die with evidence like that"".",9,30 July 2011,"When I was a store manager for a regional supermarket chain, about thirty years or so ago, our team was presented a developmental seminar featuring ""12 Angry Men"". Breaking into work groups, our task was to watch the film, and at strategically paused moments, predict which of the jurors would be the next to change their verdict from guilty to not guilty. It was an exercise in analytical thinking and observation of human behavior, characteristics that a good manager needs in order to develop a work force toward a common goal. There was actually a group that got all the positions right from one through twelve, which astounded me. Watching today, I got stuck again right at the outset, figuring Jack Klugman's Juror #5 would be the first to be influenced by Henry Fonda's argument.The film is an extraordinary piece of ensemble acting, and if the players weren't that well known back in the day, they have certainly made themselves a name since. Almost all have passed on, but to see actors like Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Martin Balsam, Ed Begley and Klugman all in one film is a veritable treat, even apart from the story. But it's the story itself that rivets one's attention to the screen, and the slow, methodical plodding Fonda brings to the table with convincing arguments even in the face of his own uncertainty about the case. With a surety that ""The facts are supposed to determine the case"", Fonda's character struggles to assure his fellow jurors that the life of an accused killer is worth the effort to consider reasonable doubt.Aside from Fonda, the two most galvanizing characters are portrayed by Lee J. Cobb and Ed Begley. Begley, Juror #10, who exhibits the most extreme traits of racism and bigotry, forces each of the jurors to confront their own prejudices in an uncomfortable scene where almost every other juror stands up and turns their back on him. Cobb, Juror #3, has a much more personal investment in the trial, harboring a failed relationship with his own son that colors his view of the world. The really interesting point regarding Fonda's character is that he accomplished his mission without ever raising his voice. I don't think I could have done that considering the stakes involved.It's a rare film that can anchor the viewer in one spot for an hour and a half and make time fly by with an intriguing story and realistic dialog. Rarer still is the ability to poke a finger at one's own pre-conceived notions of guilt or innocence, forcing the serious viewer to take a seat at the jury table and examine the facts from all sides before voting guilty or not guilty.",12 Angry Men
8,gavin6942,Deservedly a Top Ten Film,9,30 September 2014,"A dissenting juror (Henry Fonda) in a murder trial slowly manages to convince the others that the case is not as obviously clear as it seemed in court.Today's audiences will find a young Jack Warden, perhaps now best known as Big Ben from ""Problem Child"", and Wisconsin-born John Fiedler, whose voice is recognizable as Piglet from ""Winnie the Pooh"". Along with Ed Begley and Henry Fonda, you already have a strong cast (and the other eight men are no slouches).This film is timeless, both as a tribute to great actors of their generation, but also as a testament of the greatness of the American justice system. One likes to think this has inspired at least a few people to approach jury duty with the utmost seriousness and give the concept of ""reasonable doubt"" a run for its money.",12 Angry Men
9,lee_eisenberg,I find this movie guilty of being a masterpiece.,10,6 August 2005,"Shot in real time, this story of a jury trying to decide whether a young man is innocent or guilty never lets the viewer's attention go. Henry Fonda plays Juror #8, who is convinced the entire time that the defendant is innocent, while everyone else has already called him guilty. Throughout the movie, we not only get to hear everyone's opinions on the matter, but also every possibility of the verdict. With ""12 Angry Men"", Sidney Lumet brought to the screen the same kind of ""closing in"" feeling that he brought to movies like ""Network"". In the end, the issue is not whether the defendant is innocent or guilty; the important point is the process by which the jurors reached their decision. This may be THE perfect movie.",12 Angry Men
10,jboothmillard,12 Angry Men,9,5 June 2011,"I should start by saying that twelve is my favourite number, but it wasn't just because of that that I planned to see this film, I had heard many people state it is one of the finest films in the genre, from debuting Oscar and Golden Globe nominated director Sidney Lumet (Murder on the Orient Express, Dog Day Afternoon). Basically the jury of twelve men (a jury is always twelve people) has just come from the courtroom after hearing the defence and prosecution rest their cases, and they are now the people who must decide the verdict for the case. They must determine if a young Spanish-American is guilty or not guilty of the first degree murder by stabbing of his father, and if they all unanimously agree to find him guilty he instantly gets sentenced to death. With a weak alibi of going out to the movies and not remembering what he saw, a knife he supposedly bought and lost, and a number of witnessed hearing screams, someone shouting the words ""I'm going to kill you"" and possible seeing it happen, it seems open and shut. All Jurors have immediately decided to vote guilty, one Juror however is voting not guilty until he clears up the facts, this is Mr. Davis, aka Juror #8 (BAFTA winning Henry Fonda, also producing). At first he is voting opposite to everyone else for the sake of conversation and discussion, deliberations however crop up and he slowly straightens things out and brings forward things that the defence, prosecution and ultimately witnesses may have missed. These include Juror #8 having the same knife as the boy and pondering the stabbing, the noises going on when the murder happened, the reason for the shouted words, the timing of the old man heading to answer the door, and most importantly, a key witness who chose not to wear glasses but marks on her nose prove she does. Slowly the Jurors, some wise, bright and empathetic, one or two arrogant, prejudiced and merciless, may be seeing that this lone Juror has some good points and brings forward some good ideas as to what may have happened. Juror #3 (The Exorcist's Golden Globe nominated Lee J. Cobb) and Juror #10 (Ed Begley) for a long while seem adamant to stick to their verdicts of guilty, but slowly the others: Juror #1 (Psycho's Martin Balsam), Juror #2 (John Fiedler), Juror #4 (E.G. Marshall), Juror #5 (Jack Klugman), Juror #6 (Edward Binns), Juror #7 (Being There's Jack Warden), Juror #9 (Joseph Sweeney), Juror #11 (George Voskovec) and Juror #12 (Robert Webber), do start to doubt their decision is right. Being swayed by the very convincing predictions of the murder events, one by one the Jurors change their verdict to not guilty, until the final one sobbingly gives in, and in the end they all agree the boy should go free. Fonda gives a magnificent performance as the calm, collective and convincing lone voting Juror to turn the others decision, Cobb is equally fantastic as the one who takes ages to change the mind of, and the other actors all get their moments on screen as well. The one location film based on a play could have been a little dull, but director Lumet keeps you gripped with a marvellously worded script played out to perfection by the actors, with the addition of great camera work and set pieces as well, it is a brilliant classic courtroom drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Henry Fonda was number 6 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, Juror #8 was number 28 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was number 88 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 87 on 100 Years, 100 Greatest Movies, and it was number 42 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers. Very good!",12 Angry Men
11,Woodyanders,"An outstanding courtroom drama thriller which benefits greatly from tight direction, a literate script and superb acting from a first-rate cast",10,30 July 2006,"A teenage Puerto Rican boy from the slums is on trial for allegedly murdering his own father. Eleven of the twelve jurors are certain that he's guilty, but one token odd man out dissenting juror (beautifully played with subtle understatement by Henry Fonda) has his doubts. The juror gets everyone else to question their motives and more heavily scrutinize every last minute detail of the seemingly cut and dried case.Director Sidney Lumet, working from Reginald Rose's smart, literate and incisive script, further aided by Boris Kaufman's sharp black and white cinematography and Kenyon Hopkins' spare, unobtrusive score, works wonders with the simple premise, placing a keen and intimate emphasis on the exceptionally colorful and distinctive dozen characters. The uniformly marvelous acting from a bang-up ensemble cast qualifies as a substantial sterling asset: Fonda and Lee J. Cobb are both terrific as radically opposing guys who are at continual loggerheads with each other while Ed Begley (incredibly fearless as a despicable racist jerk), Jack Warden, Joseph Sweeney (simply lovely as the old man), George Voskovec, Martin Balsam, Jack Klugman, John Fiedler, Robert Webber, E.G. Marshall and the criminally underrated Edward Binns all lend top-drawer support in equally meaty roles. The twelve individual jurors serve as a very revealing and insightful microcosm of our justice system in particular and our society in general, representing all the various flaws, strengths and quirks of our culture which range from blithe indifference (Warden's boorish baseball fan, Webber's slick advertising executive) to cold pragmatism (Marshall's prissy intellectual) to meek passivity (Fiedler's soft-spoken wimp) to foul prejudice (Begley's unforgettably odious hatemonger, Cobb's seething ball of roaring rage and resentment) to true blue responsible patriotism (Fonda's calm voice of liberal reason, Sweeney's supportive old man, Voskovec's proud adopted American immigrant). Kaufman's gorgeously crisp photography tremendously heightens the considerable tension, palpably evoking a sweaty, uncomfortable and claustrophobic sweltering hot atmosphere that's as gripping as it is convincing. In the hands of a lesser cast and director the story could have been flat and stagy. But Lumet's tight direction and the seamless ensemble acting from an amazing cast effortlessly blend together to create a crackling sense of absorbing drama and rip-snorting energy that's constantly engrossing and exciting throughout. An undeniable classic.",12 Angry Men
12,ccthemovieman-1,Another Liberal Propaganda Classic,4,8 September 2006,"Ah, another Liberal ""classic"" with Henry Fonda, a true left winger showing all the right wingers where they went wrong!This all-star cast is really a play as the entire thing takes places in a jurors' room where 12 men determine the fate of a suspect charged with murder. Eleven of them vote ""guilty"" but Fonda holds out for ""not guilty."" The story is about him slowly convincing everyone else to see things his way. There are lots of familiar faces from the '50s: Lee J. Cobb, Ed Begley, E.G. Marshall, Jack Warden, Martin Balsam, Jack Klugman, etc. They are all interesting.Good for one look. As with most movies with political leanings (this one, All The Kings Men, The Manchurian Candidate, etc.) Hollywood is always ready for re-makes where Liberal causes are far more pronounced than they are in these classic movies. Only in the twisted mind of Liberals are we to have more sympathy for the criminal than the victim. Only in Hollywood are the defense attorneys always the good guys and movies end like this where nobody ever goes to jail!",12 Angry Men
13,rmax304823,Finely tuned,8,11 November 2003,"First of all, what a cast! Fonda doesn't seem like much of a New Yorker, but the rest of the cast reads like a Who's Who in New York movies. All of them except Sweeney and Voscovek went on to lengthy careers in character and support roles.The plot comes from a TV show and is very tightly written. There's hardly a wasted word or an unnecessary gesture. This has its drawbacks because it imposes a dramatic frame on the characters and the development. There's not much sense of ""real life"" here. Everything fits together too neatly for that. But if events follow earlier events with a logic that is a bit obvious, it's forgivable because the screenplay is done so well. Like ""Stagecoach,"" it may be mechanical but it's as finely tuned as a good wristwatch.Also more or less unavoidable in a short movie dealing with a dozen often conflicting characters is the reduction in their complexity. Each is a stereotype. They practically wear sweatshirts with logos on them. ""I AM A SHALLOW AD MAN."" ""BORED MARMALADE SALESMAN HERE."" ""KICK ME, I AM AN IGNORANT RACIST."" They are capable of changing their opinions but they show only one side of their characters.A third unfortunate quality in the script is that it is imbued with what Tom Wolfe referred to as ""nostalgie de la bou"" -- a kind of admiration for the lowbrow. Pauline Kael made the same observation back in the early 60s in an essay called ""Fantasies of the Art House Audience."" What it boils down to is a dislike of the middle-class. Fonda is an architect, a professional. The other good guys in the movie are members of minority groups or ordinary working stiffs with slum backgrounds. The two most repulsive villains (Ed Begley and Lee J. Cobb) are self-made men who run their own successful businesses. The rufescent Begley has a line, something like, ""I got ten factories going to pot while we're talking' here."" Cobb brags about how he built up his delivery business starting out with nothing. A third dummy is a SALESMAN -- of marmalade! (Yukk.)Okay. That gets pretty much all of the weaknesses out of the way. The pluses outweigh the minuses by exactly two short tons. The acting is almost impossible to improve upon, not surprisingly. It's unfair to single out Jack Warden and Martin Balsam for their performances but I'll do it anyway.The photography, by Boris Kaufman, is perceptive and adds to the tension, the feeling of claustrophobia. Especially memorable is the scene in which most of the jurors are standing together, there is a rumble of thunder, and a shadow falls gloomily over the group. It's a small touch but palpable.Lumet manages to suggest New York City effectively in this crowded room, practically the only set. (There is a shot at the end that is done on the steps of the real Courthouse.) Lumet's direction makes the most of his actors' talents. The pauses in their arguments last just long enough for us to take a few breaths.Rose's script avoids an easy ending. Yes, there is reasonable doubt enough for the verdict to turn out as it does, but there is no dramatic introduction of crucial evidence to demonstrate that the defendant is innocent. Did he do it? We don't know. Suppose the kid actually did it and gets away with it? Fonda is twice challenged on that point -- once at the table and once in the men's room -- and in neither instance does he have a reply.Overall, it's a marvelous movie, a lesson in acting, directing, writing, and shooting. The recent updated version has been made politically correct but is not an improvement over this original. See it if you have the chance.",12 Angry Men
14,Tweekums,One of the greats,10,18 December 2012,"As the film opens we see the inside of a court room; the evidence has already been put to the jurors and the judge is reminding them of their solemn duty... the twelve of them must reach a unanimous verdict and a guilty verdict will mean an automatic death sentence for the accused. The way the jurors talk as they enter the jury room it sounds like an open and shut case; they call for a quick vote before any discussions take place; eleven men say he is guilty, but one dissents. Juror Eight explains that he doesn't necessarily believe that the accused, an eighteen year old slum boy, is innocent but he won't allow him to be executed without the jurors even discussing the evidence. On the face of it the evidence is compelling; the accused bought a knife just like the murder weapon a couple of weeks previously, the woman across the railway line says she looked out of the window and saw the killing, the man below says he heard the accused shout 'I'm going to kill you' before hearing the body fall and seeing the accused leave the building. Gradually they look at each piece of evidence in turn and as doubts are raised the number of 'not guilties' increases but some jurors are adamant that they just know he did it; to get an acquittal prejudices must be overcome too.Set almost entirely within the confines of the jury room this film is rightfully considered a classic; it may not contain any action but it is taut from start to finish. The fact that we haven't seen any of the trial means the viewer must rely on what the jurors say to decide whether or not they think the accused is guilty and for the whole time they are deliberating we don't even know their names. The cast of twelve do a great job playing each of the very different characters; obviously Henry Fonda stands out as he is the best known actor and plays the man arguing against the majority but each of the others also put in fine performances; especially Lee J. Cobb and Ed Begley who play the two jurors most determined to bring in a guilty verdict. The way some of the evidence is questioned in the jury room in a way that it was never questioned in court may be a little unlikely... especially the incident with the second knife but it isn't too far fetched and that particular moment is a brilliant piece of theatre that anybody who watches the film will remember for years afterwards. This is one of those films that everybody should see at least once.",12 Angry Men

16,moonspinner55,"A bit overwrought, over-directed, but compelling nonetheless...",8,13 November 2005,"Twelve-man jury decides the fate of a young man on trial for murder; eleven think the kid is guilty, the twelfth isn't so sure. Director Sidney Lumet makes his directorial debut here, and he's overly fond of riled-up actors shouting at the camera, but he doesn't stray from the proved path of this celebrated play by Reginald Rose, and that's a plus (the material stands quite well on its own). The claustrophobic, muggy atmosphere is rife with tension, and Henry Fonda is a tower of sanity as the only voice of reason. The film attempts to substitute the electricity of a live performance with too many tight shots of angry, sweaty faces, spitting and yelling, however this ensemble cast has a rich anti-camaraderie that puts the film across. *** from ****",12 Angry Men
17,Quinoa1984,a tight ball of male-dominated classic cinema,10,6 March 2006,"It's tough sometimes to translate a stage production- which 12 Angry Men essentially is- into a feature film, with in this case one cramped room and a dozen characters with totally varied ideals. In a way this is like the textbook example, however, of how to do a film like this. You see how the situation unfolds into something more, about the act of telling a story and finding all the pieces. That it has such a powerhouse of an ensemble doesn't hurt it at all, and the little surprises in how the casts acts and reacts works great on repeat viewings. The basic premise only needs brief mention, as the 12 men (totally angry may be disputed by some, though I'm sure not one is left without raising their voice), all white, are judging the case of a Hispanic charged with killing his father. The deliberation room becomes a kind of boiler room where Henry Fonda's juror #11, the only un-sure one, sets the stage for a something more to be revealed- human nature when on a judgment day, with all its intelligence, ignorance, hate, and seeking objectivism.Sidney Lumet, on his very first feature-film, does a really professional (in a good way) job of directing the picture, by which a) letting the actors, who among the great lot include Lee J Cobb, John Fiedler, E.G. Marhall, Martin Balsam, Jack Klugman, Ed Begley, and in maybe the most under-rated role of the 'old man', Joseph Sweeney, just do their work and try to just make sure no one over-steps their ability in their strengths; b) using the atmosphere to high effect. Like he would later do with Network, Lumet uses the camera to add some level of subjectivity to the storytelling, being careful with choosing close-ups but using them very wisely (i.e. a surprise close-up on Sweeney), and here and there making it feel like the walls are just closing in a little more. But, at the same time, Lumet's making a studio picture, with the all-around good-guy Henry Fonda (in one of his best roles), and dealing with a story that's, when it comes down to it, just the details of a crime examined over. But the real strength of the film comes in a quality that it shares with Rashomon (different in structure to be sure), that the idea of looking for the truth is just a guise in a way to examine the people who are looking at what the truth is. It's a nifty movie that has deservedly stayed firm through the decades, not showing its age bad at all.",12 Angry Men
18,JohnHowardReid,Watch it at home!,8,13 December 2017,"As a theatrical movie, 12 Angry Men, hemmed in by its extremely scant production values, holds only mild interest at best. As a DVD, however, in any of the excellent versions marketed by M-G-M, 12 Angry Men comes across as an engrossing and tense drama that keeps the viewer's eyes fixed on the TV screen for every second of its 95 minutes. Why the difference? Simply the movie's genesis in a TV play and the rigid intention of producers Rose and Fonda to keep strictly within the play's one-room setting, aside from a brief prologue and epilogue, and an inconsequential scene in a washroom. As a TV play, 12 Angry Men is such an expertly crafted drama, it justifiably ranks as one of the best ever presented. As a movie, however, it's close to a no-show.I wonder how many of its thousands of ecstatic admirers have actually seen 12 Angry Men presented in a real cinema on a real 1.85:1 theater screen? Including me, it's my guess you could count that number on your fingers. The picture just doesn't work half as effectively on a cinema screen. It's too confined. True, it still has some emotional highs, mostly due to the very clever interpretations by both Jack Warden and Joseph Sweeney, who contrive to steer a charismatic middle course between the stridently way over-the-top yelling and screaming by Begley and Cobb and the frozen-faced, overly unemotional Fonda, Klugman, Webber and Voskevec. Actually, on a theater screen, Warden actually comes across with much greater impact than he does on TV. In a cinema, he and Sweeney play the characters with whom audiences most identify. Fonda seems too cold. Yet on TV, he's perfect! True, hats-off reviews ensured the movie sold a lot of tickets, but theater patrons were often disappointed.",12 Angry Men

Conservatives are depicted as bigoted idiots. Henry Fonda, the juror who swayed all eventually, has a liberal, creative mind. He is really able to come up with creative ideas that leads to the acquittal of the defendant. Fonda is the dream juror for every defense attorney, as well as a nightmare for prosecuting attorneys.Lee J. Cobb steals the film with an outstanding performance as a hateful juror who allows his personal problems with an alienated son to feel that the accused is guilty. Ditto for Jack Warden, who really switched his vote in order to get to that baseball game.When viewing E.G. Marshall's performance, I could not help think back about his acting in the television series-""The Defenders."" He is really the opposite hereEd Begley really spews out bigoted ideas that most of ""these people"" aren't any good and think nothing of a life. We are constantly reminded about the downtrodden, the abused child, slum and poverty living in relation to crime and other factors. The film is really a good psychological-sociological drama if anything.It seems as though the violent thunderstorm signaled a break in the action. When the lights were put on, the fan worked. Why didn't someone in the court tell the jurors about the fan and the light? Especially, as it was a sweltering day.As the jury foreman, Martin Balsam is supposed to conduct the agenda in order. Instead, he really allows the other jurors to dominate.Wouldn't you love to see the reaction in court when the verdict was read? How did the accuse react? The judge?

""12 Angry Men"" is righteously considered as one of the top 5 most genius movies ever made! I realize it changes quite frequently, but at the time I'm writing this user-comment, Sidney Lumet's amazing debut film is #5 in the IMDb Top 250! That's a fantastic accomplishment, especially if you consider this film is more than sixty years old, doesn't feature any computer-engineered special effects and hasn't got any geeky cult followings that dress up like the lead characters. Heck, if you take out the everlasting and manipulated feud between ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Godfather"", this ""12 Angry Men"" may even be the REAL #1! But ""12 Angry Men"" deserves all the superlatives you could possible use to describe it. Everything about this film is perfect, and if there's one film that literally everybody should be obliged to watch at least once in his/her lifetime, I think it ought to be this one. The original story by Reginal Rose is wondrously absorbing, intelligent, intense and still incredibly relevant even after 60 years. Rose's own adaptation into a movie screenplay is also amazing, with not a single word or piece of dialogue too much or too few. The ensemble cast exists of twelve hyper-professional actors that each give away one of the most impeccable performances of their careers; most notable Henry Fonda as the humane hero, Lee J. Cobb as the dogmatic narcissist and E.G. Marshall as the rigorous pundit. But the biggest geniuses remain director Sidney Lumet and his cameraman Boris Kaufman.

22,sunwarrior13,A Legal Cinema Masterpiece,10,9 January 2012,"A Puerto Rican youth is on trial for murder, accused of knifing his father to death.Directed by Sidney Lumet, 12 Angry Men tells the story of a jury made up of 12 men as they deliberate the guilt or acquittal of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt. In the United States, the verdict in most criminal trials by jury must be unanimous one way or the other. The film is notable for its almost exclusive use of one set: with the exception of the film's opening, which begins outside on the steps of the courthouse and ends with the jury's final instructions before retiring, a brief final scene on the courthouse steps and two short scenes in an adjoining washroom, the entire movie takes place in the jury room. The twelve jurors retire to the jury room, having been admonished that the defendant is innocent until proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Eleven of the jurors vote for conviction, each for reasons of his own. The sole holdout is Juror #8, played by Henry Fonda. As Fonda persuades the weary jurors to re-examine the evidence, we learn the backstory of each man. Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb), a bullying self-made man, has estranged himself from his own son. Juror #7 (Jack Warden) has an ingrained mistrust of foreigners; so, to a lesser extent, does Juror #6 (Edward Binns). Jurors #10 (Ed Begley) and #11 (George Voskovec), so certain of the infallibility of the Law, assume that if the boy was arrested, he must be guilty. Juror #4 (E.G. Marshall) is an advocate of dispassionate deductive reasoning. Juror #5 (Jack Klugman), like the defendant a product of ""the streets,"" hopes that his guilty vote will distance himself from his past. Juror #12 (Robert Webber), an advertising man, doesn't understand anything that he can't package and market. And Jurors #1 (Martin Balsam), #2 (John Fiedler) and #9 (Joseph Sweeney), anxious not to make waves, ""go with the flow."" The excruciatingly hot day drags into an even hotter night; still, Fonda character,Juror #8 chips away at the guilty verdict, insisting that his fellow jurors bear in mind those words ""reasonable doubt.""This is a classic film wherein where tension comes from personality conflict, dialogue and body language.Although it may sound ungallant, these 12 Angry Men, are all right without distaff glamour. Their dramas are powerful and provocative enough to keep a viewer spellbound.Sidney Lumet,who is in his directorial debut,effectively modulates the drama without ever taking the camera out of the jury room until the verdict is in and the jury is out.As for the story,it was mechanically written, but within its own middlebrow limitations, it delivers the goods as it presents a powerful impact to the viewer.",12 Angry Men

24,hitchcockthelegend,"Unlikely, but it is possible.",9,24 July 2010,"12 Angry Men is directed by Sidney Lumet and adapted from a teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose. The cast is headed by Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb. The film tells the story of a jury made up of 12 men as they deliberate the guilt or innocence of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt. Except for two short scenes at the beginning and end of the film, it's filmed entirely on one set, that of the jury deliberation room.Sweaty, gritty, claustrophobic - all words that sit snugly in the context of Lumet's excellently crafted deconstruction of 12 men trying to arrive at one verdict in the case of a Puerto Rican youth on trial for the murder of his father. The evidence appears overwhelming, there's witnesses, a murder weapon and motive, the boy is surely on his way to the electric chair. 11 of the men are convinced he's guilty, only one man stands alone, Henry Fonda's juror number 8, who refuses to turn in a vote of guilty until the evidence and facts are discussed at length. As the others rail against him and tempers get frayed, juror number 8 prompts the others to examine their own prejudices and commitment to justice.A lesson in tight direction and editing, and with performances to match, 12 Angry Men is quite simply not to be missed by those seeking to venture into classic cinema. 9/10",12 Angry Men

26,jotix100,Beyond a reasonable doubt,10,8 February 2005,"Having seen the film before, we decided to take another look recently when it showed up on a cable channel. This Sidney Lumet 1957 film still packs a lot of power, even though times have changed in the way our justice system works. The screen play by Reginald Rose shows his brilliant insight into human beings that are called to sit as jurors in a murder case.If you haven't seen the film, perhaps you don't want to read any further.It's 1957 when this case goes to court. We watch the accused man staring toward the panel in whose hands his fate rests. The jury is all male. We get to know that a public defendant was appointed to defend the accused man. We realize he hasn't done a great job, as most of the men in the jury room are convinced this boy is guilty before he has been proved innocent.We watch as the men are settling into their chairs around the deliberating table, and how a juror is standing by the window looking toward the streets below, lost in thought. It's stifling in the room. Those were the days of not having air conditioned all over, so these men are sweating in the uncomfortable room during one of the worst days of the summer.As the men proceed to have a preliminary vote, juror number eight casts a 'not guilty' vote that shocks the room. How dare he go against the majority? Who is he to stand in the way of what seems to be an open and shut case? This guy is guilty! Thus begins the deliberations in which all these men bring their own prejudices and biases to determine if the boy will go to the electric chair, which by all appearances, seems to be the case here. It's because of one decent man that doesn't mind facing the rest that we get to know why the accused couldn't have done the murder the authorities say he committed. In the process the jurors will get to understand the meaning of justice.This drama owes Henry Fonda a debt of gratitude. We can't think of any other actor playing this juror. Mr. Fonda exudes kindness and he is the only person in the room that is not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt the boy has killed his own father. Not only did he make a contribution as an actor, but also helped produced the movie.Lee J. Cobb, one of the great American actors of the last century, is seen as a juror that sees in the accused young man his own estranged son, who he hasn't seen in a couple of years, having left home because of the conflict with the old man. Mr. Cobb is just the opposite of Mr. Fonda, and he gives an intense performance to show us this man in turmoil. The rest of the cast is wonderful. Each one has his own moment to shine.There is not a single moment that rings false in the movie. In reading a couple of comments about ""12 Angry Men"", some people marvel there were no women in the jury, or that the accused man's case hasn't been presented by the defense attorney in a more effective way. We have to remember first of all, the times in which the action takes place, and the fact that being a poor man, the accused man has been given an attorney who was obviously not interested in his defense. The young man being from a minority migrant group didn't elicit sympathy from these jurors, at all, which might have been the prosecution's goal in going along with the selection.This is a movie that should be seen by anyone serving in a jury in a court of justice. Mr. Lumet and Mr. Rose have created a timeless film that will be the standard in which everything else is judged.",12 Angry Men
27,Hey_Sweden,A masterpiece of acting and filmmaking.,10,19 September 2013,"Brilliant film version of the televised play, scripted by the plays' author Reginald Rose, and produced by Rose and leading actor Henry Fonda. It's fascinating and compelling, offering memorable showcases to an amazing ensemble. The basic story is solid, but more than that, it's a nice look into a rich variety of characters, each with their own background and reasoning. It's all the more impressive for being a young Sidney Lumets' filmmaking debut; he makes this a highly charged, atmospheric experience.An 18 year old teenager is on trial for murder, and the jury has retired to discuss the case. When things start out, 11 men are ready to convict the boy, and there's one holdout, juror no. eight (Fonda); Fonda doesn't necessarily believe the boy is innocent, but he's passionate in his belief that there's enough *reasonable doubt* in the matter to refrain from voting guilty. He encounters a fair amount of hostility at first, particularly from the excitable juror no. three (Lee J. Cobb), but as the night falls and a storm starts up, he wears down his fellow men a bit at a time, insisting on bringing up facts that he felt weren't adequately explained during the trail.What's so wonderful about ""12 Angry Men"" is how believable it all is, right down to one juror, the baseball loving juror no. seven (Jack Warden) being willing to change his vote just to get the hell out of there, and the earnest juror no. 11 (George Voskovec) admonishing him for not doing this for the *right* reason. Each actor gets their own chance in the spotlight, and they're all superb. Cobb has the most intense role as a truly stubborn man who's gotten himself personally involved in the case; Ed Begley is equally potent as juror no. 10, another holdout. Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Edward Binns, Joseph Sweeney, and Robert Webber fill out the rest of this powerhouse cast.While the story is quite good dramatically, it's not without some humour, some of it coming from adman Webber. Use of music is sparing, which only adds a sense of realism to the proceedings. One of the most striking moments is when most of the group turns their backs to Begley after he launches into a rather disconcerting rant.Overall, this does deserve to be considered one of the finest American films of all time. It keeps the viewer riveted every step of the way.10 out of 10.",12 Angry Men
28,Doylenf,Claustrophobic but compelling story of jury conflict after murder trial...,7,7 January 2007,"TWELVE ANGRY MEN is essentially a claustrophobic slice of jury duty, where jurors are herded into a New York City courtroom to discuss the facts of a murder trial of a boy accused of murdering his father.Gradually, with stark close-ups of sweating faces, we get to know the men after a brief round of small talk leads to the small details of the case after choosing a jury foreman (MARTIN BALSAM).Most of these fine actors are gone now, but interestingly enough the three who played the angriest men (LEE J. COBB, E.G. MARSHALL and ED BEGLEY) all died of heart attack several years after filming this one. HENRY FONDA, as the man who carefully reconstructs what might have happened, had a long screen career that ended after winning an Oscar for ON GOLDEN POND.Based on a TV play directed by Sidney Lumet, it's a faithful retelling of the tale, photographed with stark realism that catches the sweaty courtroom on a hot summer day and is basically a character study of each man, each one put under the microscope by a shrewd director who gets the most from his players.The tension builds from the disagreements that arise over deliberations until the final struggle to reach a decision depends on the vote of the one stubborn hold-out (LEE J. COBB). Fonda is the man who presents his own theory of what actually happened and is able to persuade the others, one by one, to his side of the argument.Extremely well done drama seems almost documentary in its display of jury room deliberations when tempers flash, where patience is strained and reason finally sees the light of day after Fonda (never convinced of the boy's guilt in killing his father) is able to present his doubts to the other jurors.

As we all know the action is virtually confined to the Jury Room in the wake of a murder trial to which we are not privy. It seems open and shut and eleven of the jurors are ready to vote guilty and get out of there but one man persuades them to at least consider the possibility that the accused is innocent. Eventually all twelve jurors vote not guilty, end of story. BUT: It they are correct then WHO did kill the victim? Presumably the police never bothered to search for anyone else so is there a murderer on the loose? Conversely, what if the accused really IS guilty, then they have conspired to let a murderer walk free. Clearly this began life as a play for television for which its single set is ideal and the transformation to the big screen is masterly. All twelve actors are beyond praise and this is, without question, a truly fine film, yet a film that tackles moral questions so forthrightly should itself be questioned by ignoring others.",12 Angry Men

32,Boba_Fett1138,About as good as it can get.,9,27 July 2010,"This is minimalistic movie making at its very best. I mean as far as movies set in a single room go this is simply the best one out there. Lots of later movies tried to imitate it and attempted to reach the same level of successful and brilliance but none of them have even come close yet.It also has one of the most simple premises out there. All that the movie is about is 12 jurors trying to decide whether or not the accused in a murder-trial is guilty of the crime or not. So the movie is all talk but sure no bore. It's a movie that is always going and at all times interesting, due to its diverse and rich characters and its simple, yet greatly intriguing concept. I have no illusions about it though that this is also how its like in real life. So even though the movie takes a realistic approach with its story, it's still obviously fiction but at least it's not overwritten or ever exaggerated.Interesting and most effective thing about the movie is that it starts off with only one guy voting for the accused being not guilty, even though he himself is not at all convinced that he is actually innocent. He only wants to talk about it because he feels like he owes it to the guy, who's life they are deciding about. All are reluctant at first, since it seemed to be a clear and done case but the more elements and proof gets debated about the more doubt arises about his guilt. So slowly opinions start to slide and some of the jurors get set up against each other, due to their different opinions. Its what keeps the movie so interesting to watch and is also what makes the movie a real well flowing well.It's also brilliantly brought to the screen by director Sidney Lumet, who had never directed a theatrical movie before actually. Even though the movie is set in mostly one room he uses this aspect to the maximum and to the movie its own advantage. It gives the movie a great atmosphere and feel to it. There are some long and dynamic shots, that allow all of the characters to often do their say in a sequences. It gives the characters actually some depth and personality, even though we never get to know all of their names and of course it's not being the type of movie that has the space and time to do some character building. Sidney Lumet really did the most and best with the story and its characters.It's obviously a character drive movie and in a way also a real great character study. So it also really helps the movie that it has some truly great actors in it. I was a bit worried about Henry Fonda being what was supposed to be the most sympathetic character, also since I was used to seeing Jack Lemmon in that role, in the 1997 remake. But no, Fonda was just surprisingly great and effective in his role. Lee J. Cobb was also really great but by saying that I feel like I'm not given the rest of the cast enough credit. All are simply great in their roles, though it are Fonda and Cobb that stand out, also because they are being the main characters of the movie, that throughout stand opposite to each other with their views and opinions.

33,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Stunning,10,9 June 2010,"This is one of the best films I have ever had the good fortune of watching. A jury is nearly convinced that the accused is guilty. One man stands against the rest and argues that he may not be. In the 90 minutes that follow, this goes into these twelve individuals, and we see how peer pressure and personal prejudices can sway decisions that ought not to be taken lightly. This is a masterpiece, and it is so on account of all the elements being carefully crafted, each excellent on their own, and the mix of them all being so seamless. Every character(they are the focus of this, if the well thought out case itself does get a lot of attention as well) and the script is well-written, developed impeccably and credible. This is quite realistic, and what flaws there are were possibly conscious decisions for the dramatic effect(it is not a documentary, nor was it meant to be), and do not take away from the whole. The acting is perfect for all concerned. This is carried by dialog and marvelous speeches, with no flashbacks and essentially only one setting(albeit the cinematography makes full use of it, so no claustrophobia is induced). The camera stays on the people, follows them, remains on them for reactions when someone else suddenly speaks, and there are long takes. Editing is impossibly subtle. You forget that it's a movie. Instead, you find yourself experiencing this tense situation with them. A dozen men in a locked room, determining if someone lives or dies. This raises questions about the legal system, as well. Other than Serpico, I haven't seen anything by Lumet, but Dog Day Afternoon is on my list of ones to get. There is some mildly disturbing content and a few instances of moderate language in this. The DVD comes with the original trailer. I recommend this to everyone. 10/10",12 Angry Men

I was blown away.I saw the high rating of this movie and thought it would be good but it's a movie from 1957 so how good are we talking. Then as the movie started I see 12 white male jurors go into jury chambers to decide the fate of either an Italian or Latino teen. Instantly, I thought, ""I'm going to hate this movie."" And as the subtle and not so subtle personality traits and ideologies of some of the men became known I thought, ""I'm really going to hate this movie.""But not so fast my fine movie-going friend. The 1950's just may be able to surprise you. And that it did. This movie about the American justice system and the power of jurors who take justice seriously is a tremendous tribute and example of what justice should be.The entire unfolding of the movie was so realistic: the yelling, the arguing, the soapbox preaching, the prejudices, the practical, the impractical, the logical, the emotional, those who cared, those who couldn't careless, it was flat out real. They couldn't have done a better job with the characters, the writing, and the acting. 12 jurors in a stuffy jury room deliberating upon the fate of a man accused of murder and one man upsetting the balance--you can imagine the fury, frustration, impatience, misunderstanding, and impertinence. It was a recipe for disaster.It's been a while since I've actively partook in a movie to this degree. What do I mean? I mean that I'm a bit of an audible movie watcher. I will ooh and aah and make comments here and there but most movies don't elicit much from me. I found myself watching this movie and all but becoming a 13th juror. I was shouting, ""Yes!"" ""You tell 'im!"" ""That's right!"" ""Oh!"" and other comments reserved for a sermon or a sporting event. I was truly awed at the brilliance and direction of the movie/jury deliberations.

Marshall is excellent as Fonda's most formidable opponent; cool-headed and logical, he's the only holdout who bases his verdict on facts instead of emotions. Lee J. Cobb's performance wears thin, and his character is the most poorly written. Ed Begley is almost too good in his role, so revolting is his character. Jack Klugman and Jack Warden register in smaller roles as well.This movie conveys the sweaty, tension-filled atmosphere of a stifling jury room but never feels oppressive, thanks to Lumet's fluid direction. My favorite moment comes when Fonda begins counting off paces around the jury table (a key piece of evidence hinges on this), and the camera drops to floor level and follows his feet as he does so. Choices like this prevent Lumet's film from ever being static or stagy.An important film and a great one. If you haven't already seen it, put it at the top of your list.Grade: A+",12 Angry Men
36,AlsExGal,A timeless film that shows the flaws in the jury system,9,19 February 2017,"... the main flaw being that everybody brings their own life experiences and history into the jury room with them, no matter how hard they try to be impartial.Here you have a trial of a young boy who supposedly stabbed his father to death. When the jurors go back to deliberate on the case, ALL but one lone man played with a quiet courage by Henry Fonda states not guilty and the rest of the film is about trying to get them to his side. Quite amazing movie if you ask me. Fonda's case is not that the boy is innocent, but that the threshold of reasonable doubt has not been reached. The trick in this film is that it never leaves the jury room. You have no idea of what the defendant, the prosecuting attorney, or the defense attorney were like other than retroactively through the words of the jurors.Writing this good just can't be ignored. Reginald Rose's screenplay is absolutely brilliant. Not only are the characters of twelve individuals indelibly implanted in your brain within the limited time span of about 100 minutes, but Rose accomplishes this feat without undue speechifying or pontificating about injustice or the failures of the jury system or expositional dialogue. The characters personalities come out in the course of the film and are not ""set up"" in the first half hour, (as in having the jurors explain to each other what their occupations and backgrounds are) as is the case with mediocre screenplays. As for the acting it is true ensemble greatness. All twelve cast members are excellent, although if you put a gun to my head and forced me to say who was best I'd express a partiality for Lee J Cobb as the toughest nut to crack for acquittal and E.G. Marshall as a juror who is all logic and no emotion other than arrogance. And Sidney Lumet's first film just may be his most fast paced. The hundred minutes whiz by! Not a dull stretch to be seen anywhere.And yes, these are twelve white men judging a Puerto Rican boy, and yes Henry Fonda violated many classic rules of jury behavior when he introduced items into the discussion that were not official evidence, but this was 60 years ago and it IS a movie. So just suspend your beliefs and try to enjoy the art of the thing -the riveting dialogue, the character studies that don't choke each other out, and the brilliant camera-work that manages to make the room seem increasingly smaller so that you can appreciate the claustrophobia that must be setting in with the jurors as deliberations wear on and get more heated.",12 Angry Men
37,AaronCapenBanner,One Courtroom.,7,11 October 2013,"12 Jurors(played by Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Edward Binns, Jack Warden, Henry Fonda, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Vaskovec, and Robert Webber) all deliberate after a trial involving a young man charged with murdering his elderly father. Initially, 11 of the 12 find him guilty, but the one holdout(Fonda) makes his case for further deliberation, and gradually persuades the other men to his side. But the question still remains: Was the defendant innocent or guilty? Though undeniably well directed and acted, with an engrossing narrative, the one flaw is the Fonda juror, who is just insufferably sanctimonious! His argument of ""It's Possible."" to argue reasonable doubt is absurd, since if taken to its logical conclusion, would never lead to a conviction, since ""it's possible"" that it was the evil twin, or ""it's possible"" that it was paranormal in some way! It's more a study of how one strong-willed man can persuade weaker-willed men to his way of thinking, which does not inherently mean a morally just outcome! Still, a compelling film that does provoke much thought and argument, and can't be so easily dismissed, though it is overpraised.",12 Angry Men
38,christopher-underwood,most impressive,8,8 April 2021,This is most impressive with director Lumet ensuring that the viewers interest is held at all times. The script is excellent with the gradual escalation of doubt adding a level of excitement to an already interesting concept. Watching the recent Egyptian film Clash the day before where a number of disparate men are trapped inside a police van for the duration makes for an interesting comparison but whilst the Lumet film appears rather theatrical by comparison a similar tactic of using close-ups helps considerably in maintaining the interest and increasing tension. The earlier film is quite a show piece for acting talent and all acquit themselves admirably whilst it was undoubtedly a marvellous launch pad for the director's career.,12 Angry Men
39,JamesHitchcock,The Greatest-ever Legal Drama and One of the Greatest Films of All Time,10,12 April 2006,"This is a courtroom drama with a difference; we see nothing of the actual trial except the end of the judge's summing up. We only get a brief glimpse of the defendant, a young man accused of stabbing to death his abusive father. We do not see the lawyers or any of the witnesses. The action is confined to the jury room after the trial has finished. At first, eleven jurors believe that the defendant is guilty but one, played by Henry Fonda, has doubts, and tries to convince his colleagues that the case has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt.The remarkable thing about this film is that each of the twelve jurymen (all are male) emerges as an individual in his own right. Thanks are due to Vukodlak whose helpful review accurately summarises their characters. The jurors are referred to by their jury numbers, not their names, although we discover the surnames of Henry Fonda's character Number 8 (Davis) and of his colleague Number 9 (McCardle) right at the end. Number 8 is the key character. At first he is somewhat hesitant in his views. He is not convinced of the boy's innocence, and perhaps, at first, not even of the reasonable doubt about his guilt that would justify bringing in a ""not guilty"" verdict. He is, however, unwilling to condemn a young man to the electric chair without close consideration of all the issues, and suggests that the jury should take its time to talk the matter over. As they do, each piece of evidence is subjected to close scrutiny, the reliability of witnesses is cast into doubt, and holes start to emerge in what had previously seemed a watertight prosecution case. One by one the more conscientious members of the jury, with one exception, start to come over to Number 8's point of view.Four other jurors play particularly important parts in the drama. Number 7, played by Jack Warden, is the least conscientious of all. He is not worried in the least about the defendant's guilt or innocence. He has tickets for a baseball game that evening and wants to reach a verdict as quickly as possible so that he does not miss the match. At first he votes to find the defendant guilty, but when he sees how things are going he abruptly changes his vote to not guilty in order to get home more quickly. (He is deservedly rebuked by Number 11, a painstaking, foreign-born watchmaker).Number 4, played by E. G. Marshall, is the exception mentioned above, the one juror who approaches his duties conscientiously but who nevertheless holds out for a guilty verdict almost to the very end. He is a stockbroker by profession, clearly something of an intellectual. He approaches the case calmly, logically and methodically, weighing every piece of evidence. The problem is that his approach takes no account of the emotions involved and leaves no room for doubt. As one of the other jurors says, weighing up evidence is not a precise science, but Number 4 treats it as though it is. When convinced by Number 8's arguments, however, he concedes with good grace that there is now reasonable doubt in his mind and changes his vote to not guilty.Number 10 and Number 3, although Number 4's allies, are completely different in their approach to the case. Whereas he approaches it with too much scientific detachment, they approach it with too much passion and prejudice. Number 10, played by Ed Begley, is prejudiced against the young man because of his social background. In a memorable scene he gives vent to his feelings in a long rant about ""those people""; this could mean slum dwellers in general or could be a racist diatribe. (The defendant's ethnicity is never precisely established). One by one the other jurors, even those who have previously supported him, turn their backs on him. Number 3 is as violent in his feelings as Number 10, but his hatred of the young man arises less from social or racial prejudice than from his resentment of his own son, from whom he is estranged.All of the parts are very well played, including the calm, authoritative Fonda. The best, however, was Lee J Cobb as Number 3. Whereas Begley's character is simply contemptible, Cobb's is, in a way, pitiable. He is full of anger, but we see that his anger arises out of the anguish caused by his failed relationship with his own son. This is, in fact, one of those rare films where everything works perfectly- the script, the acting and Sidney Lumet's direction which emphasises the claustrophobic atmosphere of the jury room and the tension of the plot. (Lumet is one of a select band of directors who have made a masterpiece with their first film). The result is a true classic of the cinema, the greatest-ever legal drama and one of the greatest films of all time. It did not do well at the Oscars, but that is because it had the misfortune to come out in the same year as another great film, ""Bridge on the River Kwai"".Unlike some, I did not see the film as reflecting a preference for liberal political values over conservative ones; a belief in the importance of the presumption of innocence is not confined to liberals. Also, I did not see it necessarily as a vindication of the jury system. At the end of the film we feel a sense of relief that a possible miscarriage of justice has been averted, but we are also left with an uneasy feeling that, in real life, innocent people may have been convicted because their juries contained too many Wardens, Cobbs or Begleys and not enough Fondas. 10/10",12 Angry Men
40,StevePulaski,12 angry men makes one satisfied viewer,10,12 November 2015,"Sidney Lumet's 12 Angry Men is an interesting choice for one of the greatest American films of all time given its simultaneous abstraction and straight-forwardness as a film. It concerns a group of twelve jurors who are retired to reach a verdict on a murder case involving an eighteen-year-old living in the slums of New York, who is accused of murdering his father at their home. We are immediately taken into the New York City courthouse, where the twelve jurors are sent to their private room to discuss the case and come to a unanimous vote in favor of life or death for the boy. All but one juror is positive beyond a reasonable doubt that the boy in question is guilty and deserves the chair for his crimes.The man is Henry Fonda's character, a man who, like all but one other soul in the room, remains nameless until the end of the film. While he doesn't entirely believe the boy's innocence, he is unsure that he is guilty and feels it is wrong to jump to a decision about a young life so quickly without at least talking over the facts. With that, the jurors are forced to divulge some sort of conversation to get on the same page in favor of one side or the other. During this time, the New York City heat is sweltering, the fan in the room isn't working, and one juror cannot wait until he is released so he can go to a baseball game in the evening. What would normally be a quick meeting between twelve men turns into a bitter, but rational display or exchanging facts about the case and going against groupthink by providing logical alternatives to the events recounted by the witnesses.Fonda's character is called a lot of things in the film and many of them are accurate to his persona, albeit in a bitter, shortchanging manner. He is referred to as a ""golden boy,"" sympathizing a young boy in the slums who has ostensibly taken on a life of savagery if he is in fact guilty. His character basically recites the same dialog repeatedly throughout the film, stating how he is not totally sure if he indeed not guilty, but can't be certain that he is guilty, leaving a reasonable doubt on his mind that he is too ethical to override.One of the many intriguing things about Fonda's stance is his ability to go against the grain; the slightest doubt in his mind, at first, the commonality of the boy's alleged murder-weapon, a pocketknife, leads him to stall an otherwise unanimously convinced jury that the boy on trial is guilty. How many people, even if they had the slightest doubt in their mind, would challenge eleven other men who have raised their hands in favor of the boy's guilt and subsequent death? Most people, including myself probably, would bury our skepticism under our own volition of self-deprecation: ""maybe I missed something,"" we'd think, ""maybe I'm just way off,"" we'd add, before humbly raising our hand in a delayed fashion to make what looked to be a hung jury a unanimous vote. If Fonda's character would've done that, 12 Angry Men would be a depressingly common and pointless short film; not one of the greatest works of American cinema.The key to the film's renowned qualities lies in a few places. As stated, the first is the plausibility to believe the jurors become wrong-headed once they begin agreeing with Fonda's character. Some would argue that having these characters basing an entire trial/murder on the happenings of scattered incidents that were relatively minor in the grand-scheme would result in a miscarriage of justice. Film critic Mike D'Angelo says that these twelve jurors would probably be the same ones who would acquit O.J. Simpson of his murder charges. The fact is, we don't know at the end of it; we weren't there, we were never destined to be there, and all we know is that one person is dead, one person is about to own or disown responsibility to that death, and there is reasonable doubt lingering in the room like fragrant cologne. The correctness or morality of the jurors' decision isn't so much in question, for I'm sure a dinner conversation between two people who viewed the film disagreeing with the jurors' decisions could indeed occur with both parties having enough well-founded evidence.This brings me to the other noteworthy element about the film, which is its ability to operate in several different genres. The attributes of the film I just mentioned, leading it to be discussed and interpreted in a number of different ways, makes it a biting mystery, while the rapid-fire, investigative dialog in the second and third act turns the film more in the direction of a suspense film or a crime-drama. Finally, there's the inherent melodrama of character relations, with numerous not getting along with one another and the hard-headedness of other jurors standing in the way in preventing what could be a potential miscarriage of justice (Ed Begley's character, for example, who remains incorruptibly certain that the boy is guilty).Finally, above all in some minds, there's the sheer entertainment value of 12 Angry Men. This is a film that further proves my point that a film that takes place in one room and is heavily built on character relations and character development can be just as gripping as a film predicated upon large action setpieces and costly displays of action. As droll as the film may seem, this is one of the most entertaining courtroom-dramas I've yet to see with some of the most ambiguous questions about rebelling against groupthink, the analysis of justice and legal practices, and the sheer impact and significance of reasonable doubt(s) I have ever seen.",12 Angry Men
41,Smells_Like_Cheese,Terrific drama with some of the greatest actors in cinematic history,10,29 December 2006,"Gosh, I don't know how many times I studied this play and performed it in high school, not to mention how many television shows had an episode that was inspired by 12 Angry Men. It was always a great drama because of the raw human emotions that were so true and remain timeless, this play will never be dated. I couldn't wait to see this movie when I saw it at the video store and it was the first movie I slipped into the DVD player. First off, I was incredibly impressed with the credits, we not only had Henry Fonda, we had Lee J. Cobb in the cast! This movie was so well performed and such a treasure, god, I couldn't ever say any words to justify it. I've done this a million times, but here is another summary of what 12 Angry Men is all about.12 jurors are about to make a decision about a murder case, over all it seems like an open and shut case with tons of evidence that would make any good man look guilty, an 18 year old boy is about to be put to death if convicted. 11 of the men vote guilty, only one vote holds them back and they have to discuss the trial once again due to one vote being not guilty. Jurour #8 refuses to just jump to conclusions and brings up incredible possibilities that can always make a man think of ""reasonable doubts"", one by one the jurors begin to see the points he is making, except for one stubborn #3 who would rather just pull the switch to the chair himself.12 Angry Men is a timeless tale that could either be told very badly, i.e. 7th Heaven, or incredibly well and bring out terrific performances like Henry and Lee did. Actually, the whole cast was terrific, there wasn't a performance that was off key, movies like this are so needed in Hollywood today, it was so simple, but added so much for a 30 minute play. Please, if you have any taste, you will truly enjoy 12 Angry Men and have a great appreciation for it! 10/10",12 Angry Men
42,Red-Barracuda,A good courtroom drama but not without problems,7,9 September 2011,"The interesting thing about 12 Angry Men is that you come away from it and can't honestly say if the jury were right to acquit the accused man. The film never really answers the question of whether he was guilty or not. It just simply says that it was impossible to be sure. The film is ultimately about the Not Proved verdict.At least I certainly hope that we as an audience were not supposed to leave the film thinking that the accused man was definitely innocent. The counter-evidence brought to our attention by juror no. 8 (Henry Fonda) is often not especially convincing but seems to be taken very seriously by progressively more and more men in the room until inevitably we have a unanimous Not Guilty verdict. An example of this, is when Fonda successfully gets the others to acknowledge that the old man witness is unreliable, yet then goes on to base a major part of his own evidence on the old fellows testimony that he took fifteen seconds to get to the door to witness the murderer fleeing. Fonda clearly assumes that this man he has determined as unreliable would get his exact timings spot on in a moment of heightened emotion. It may seem like a minor point but there are just a little too many of these small inconsistent assumptions littering 12 Angry Men for me to feel it was an entirely successful exercise. I really couldn't help shake the notion that Fonda's character had his own agenda and was simply unwilling to back down. Perhaps he was the most persuasive man in the room and that was ultimately the reason that the decision was made. It's difficult to really say with any certainty that the accused was innocent at all. Did they really make the correct decision?Setting this consideration aside, one thing the movie does have in abundance is stellar acting talent. The 12 members of the jury are well played by all. While the direction is simple but highly efficient; it is not an easy task to set a movie in one room with dialogue the only action on offer but Sidney Lumet does keep things moving along at a good pace and maintains the interest. This is certainly a good movie despite my misgivings. For me it does ultimately have a definite ambiguous quality and if that was the intention then I can hardly argue with that.",12 Angry Men

44,sddavis63,Simple Yet Powerful; Movie-Making At Its Finest,10,28 January 2003,"Modern movies have convinced us that if a movie doesn't have big budget special effects and lots of action it's not worth watching. If you want to be healed of that viewpoint, ""12 Angry Men"" is the tonic. Here we have the simplest of movies. Except for the opening and closing couple of minutes this entire movie is set in a jury room, as 12 men debate the fate of a young man charged with murdering his father. Is he guilty or not? Will he be executed or not? The 12 jurors debate the case. And that's it, basically. And it's powerful and fascinating and you won't take your eye off the screen from the moment it starts.Henry Fonda put on an excellent (if, I thought, a little bit too preachy) performance as Juror Davis, the lone hold out as the movie starts, the vote being 11-1 in favour of guilty. Davis may not be convinced of the young man's innocence, but he sure isn't convinced of his guilt and he sets out to convince the others to give the kid a break. As good as Fonda was, though, Lee J. Cobb stole the show as Juror Number 3, an angry, hateful and vengeful man who lashes out at the ""bleeding hearts"" as they start to be convinced by Davis' arguments. An excellent supporting cast (including the likes of E.G. Marshall, Jack Warden and Jack Klugman among others) also put on wonderful performances.I thought the movie was summed up perfectly at the very end. As Davis is leaving the courthouse, he's met by Juror McCardle (Joseph Sweeney). They introduce themselves to each other (they are the only two jurors named in the movie) and then go their separate ways. These twelve men who held the life of another man in their hands didn't have a clue who each other were and would probably never see each other again. But for this brief period of time they could hold us fixated, even if we didn't know who they were.Movie-making at its finest.10/10",12 Angry Men
45,sol1218,High drama in a New York City courtroom with a man's life hanging in the balance,8,18 November 2004,"***SPOILERS*** Given what at first glance seems to be an open and shut case by The State of New York vrs George Savoca in the murder, by Mr. Savoca stabbing, of his father. As the foreman of the Jury juror #1 Martin Balsam takes a vote from the 12 jurors including himself he gets an 11 to 1 vote for the conviction of Mr. Savoca. The lone dissenter is Juror #8 Henry Fonda who wants the defendant, who if convicted automatically gets the death penalty,to at least have his case reviewed and debated before he and the rest of the Jurors make a decision that may very well cost Mr. Savoca his life. At first the debate goes nowhere until it becomes clear that the switchblade that Savoca was accused of using to murdered his father was not that unique. The fact that Juror #8 produced an exact same switchblade that he bought in a store some two blocks from the Savoca's home changed all that. Slowly one after another the men on the jury change their vote with Juror #9 and #5 Joseph Sweeney and Jack Klugman being the first two to change their vote from conviction to acquittal. The entire murder case hinged on the two eye witnesses, a lame old man and a near-sighted middle-aged woman, to the murder who lived across the street from the building where the murder was committed. The witnesses testimony was taken apart by both juror #8 and #9 when it was discovered that the old man couldn't have gotten, as he testified at the murder trial, as fast to the window to see the murder committed. As for the woman who was asleep, the murder was committed after midnight, she could not have gotten out of bed and seen, from some 60 feet away, through the windows of a passing fast moving subway train the killing without having her glasses on. The film ""12 angry Men"" ends with the only holdout of the jurors to acquit Juror #3 Lee J. Cobb breaking down and finally voting to acquit Mr. Savoca. Fine courtroom drama that is as thought-provoking now as it was back then on the screen in 1957 with every one involved giving Academy Award caliber performances even though there were a number of factors that were overlooked by the jurors that may well have proved Mr. Savoca guilt. The knife that killed Savoca's, the same kind of knife that Savoca said that he had but lost the night of the murder, father was found on the street outside his apartment. Even though Juror #8 bought an exact copy of the switchblade knife, that Savoca was said to have used, in a store not far from him home it still didn't prove his innocence. The fact that Savoca couldn't explain where he was convincingly the time that his father was murdered, he claimed he was in a movie-house where no one working there or any customer could identify him. Being the one and only suspect in his fathers murder with a motive to boot, he got into a fierce fight with his father and said that he was going to kill him a few hours before Savoca's father was murdered. It was the eye witness testimony that failed to convince the jurors that had them vote to acquit him. As convincing as the movie was in the jury acquitting Savoca in real life the jury would have in all probability have ended up by not coming to a verdict and ending up a hung jury. Two of the jurors #10 and #7 Ed Begley, Sr. and Jack Warden were more or less motivated to vote for acquittal by being intimidated and pressured by their fellow jurors then by the testimony. Juror #3 Lee J. Cobb was so unstable and emotionally screwed up that it's a wonder that he ever got on the jury in the first place unless he was such a good actor that he fooled the State prosecutor when he was paneled by him.",12 Angry Men

Secondly, the writing was intellectually gripping and emotionally engaging and I would add: respectful of the viewer's intelligence. The direction was excellent and created a feeling of growing claustrophobia guided by a very clever use of focal lenses, a credit to Sidney Lumet. Last but not least, it's about the noble concept of justice and presumption of innocence: ""12 Angry Men"" delivers a brilliant, intelligent, and universally inspiring message. To conclude, I can say I had the privilege to watch a GREAT MOVIE""Juror #5 (Jack Klugman, the man from the slum): ""What else to say?

GREAT MOVIE""Juror #8 (Henry Fonda, architect): ""This movie invites us to explore our convictions and question the way they influence our judgments. Justice is done by men, blindly and implacably, this is why punishment must be beyond any doubt, and when you have what appears to be an open-and-shut case that progressively reveals some flaws as we go deeper in the subject, well, this says a lot about the negative impact of subjectivity when it comes to justice, and how we should be careful about the consequences of our thoughts, our words, our acts. ""12 Angry Men"" is a humanistic inspiration for those who have faith in justice. GREAT MOVIE""Juror #9 (Joseph Sweeney, retired): ""This is a fantastic character study illustrating how convincingness is often driven by the personality. It's an incredible illustration of the way a few people can monopolize the talk and how a silent majority is eager to follow the ones who aggressively express their thoughts, and the courage it takes to be the lone dissenter and how using a constructive, polite and logical answer can destroy something taken for granted. While watching ""12 Angry Men"" I understood that a consensus, when rapidly built, means that the truth must be elsewhere. And one truth for sure, this is a GREAT MOVIE""Juror #10 (Ed Begley, garage owner): ""I hate the patronizing way some left-wing good-hearted people adore this film, this has nothing to do with politics, truth or justice, it's about manipulation of your thoughts by pushing the right emotional button  you missed the point, and that's the beauty of the film, you're all easily fooled. Not for the reasons you think, but it's a GREAT MOVIE""Juror #11 (Joseph Voskovek, watchmaker): ""No need to be American to appreciate the beauty of this film, it's about our deepest convictions.

But there's some courage too in setting the action entirely after the trial is over: we see only the deliberations of the jury, trying to make sense of the evidence.  In comparison to more modern (and histrionic) attempts to anatomise the legal process (such as the absurd Murder One), the merits of this judgment shine through: less really is more.  The ensemble cast is excellent, and all the characterisations are well-conceived and executed, with considerably more depth than is common in films from this era.  The only real failing is that the plot goes nowhere that you don't expect it to; but that's a flaw of many films far worse than this.",12 Angry Men
48,Pjtaylor-96-138044,A phenomenal ensemble tells one of the best cinematic stories of all time.,9,27 February 2018,"This classic court-room chamber-piece is a true cinematic staple and for good reason. '12 Angry Men (1957)' is one of the most engaging and compelling films I've ever seen, while always remaining a restrained and compact piece that pushes pure storytelling genius to the forefront in every single scene. The long, immaculately framed and blocked takes allow each cast member to simultaneously stand out and blend together to create a phenomenal ensemble as the characters realistically try to circumnavigate the complicated social situation within which they are placed. It's amazing just how much pure drama can be squeezed from something that is almost universally considered a dull chore, that being jury duty, to the point where I was constantly riveted and wholly immersed within the narrative, while also appreciating the impeccable craft going on behind the scenes. It's truly one of the best films I've seen in a long time. 9/10",12 Angry Men
49,ThomasDrufke,Masterful Filmmaking,9,5 September 2016,"Being a film buff myself, I'd like to think I know good movies when I see them. With 12 Angry Men, all it took was a few scenes and I knew this was one of the great ones. Not only was this movie important and influential, it's also easily re-watchable. I've seen it three times now and each time I pick up on new tidbits of information and dialogue that I missed the time before. I would imagine it's not easy directing an ensemble of 12 in one small room, but Sidney Lumet managed to do it, and do it very well.I often find crime-drama's to be my favorite genre of movies in large part because of the suspenseful aspects of that particular storytelling. While 12 Angry Men is far from a prototypical crime drama, it's certainly suspenseful. What begins as one man's doubts against 11 other men's desire to leave the courthouse as fast as possible, ends with a powerful message of prejudices and class issues. The nice thing about this particular criminal case is that at first listen, it's hard to argue with what some of the men are saying. There's definitely a grey area to this particular case, and that proves to help the development of the suspense and third-act revelations.Perhaps even more important than the simple theme of class issues is the idea of communication, and how far a little talking can take you. As Henry Fonda nicely put it ""we have a reasonable doubt, and that's something that's very valuable in our system. No jury can declare a man guilty unless it's sure."" All of these men were under difficult conditions, considering the small room and blistering heat, but all of them also needed to understand that communicating with each other was the only way they were going to get through the night. I loved the way Lumet gracefully gave every one of the actor's their time to shine. Although Fonda was the clear star, and likely had the most lines, here, every single one of them brought their A-game.The film also points out how easy it is to involve your own personal prejudices into cases like this. Perhaps even to some viewers it may be hard to against the grain of 11 other ""angry men"" and vote not guilty, but sometimes it takes more than just sitting around and waiting for someone else to step up. Sometimes you have to be the one to point out the questionable things in whatever job field or discussion you are in. Communication can be a difficult thing, but if you're willing to listen to others share their opinion, you should be willing to talk as well. But I do know one thing that can't be disputed, the greatness that is Sidney Lumet's 12 Angry Men.93/100",12 Angry Men
50,gbill-74877,Outstanding,10,1 October 2018,"A film whose action takes almost completely in the deliberation room of a jury may sound as if it's going to be awfully dry or uninteresting, but on the contrary, '12 Angry Men' is powerful and stirring, with real tension, fantastic characters, and great dialogue. It probes into the American judicial system, and in a larger sense, the human condition. I couldn't recommend it more highly.As a jury of twelve retire to reach a verdict in a murder trial on a sweltering day in New York, it's clear that most - in fact, eleven of them - believe the evidence against the accused is overwhelming. To me it's notable that early on, the lone holdout (Henry Fonda) isn't making all sorts of arguments as to why the defendant isn't guilty: he simply wants to make sure they proceed carefully and talk it through. He empathizes with the defendant's difficult upbringing not because he thinks it's relevant to the charges or a defense in and of itself, but because he's a decent guy who senses a rush to judgment, and perhaps most importantly, senses a bias in the room against one of ""those kinds of kids"" from the slums. What follows from there is a tour de force in critical thinking, rational discourse, and civility - all of the best things about mankind, and which save us from injustice and the mob.While the film is taut and focused on this single trial - and only this aspect of the trial - it has a number of larger messages. First and foremost, it tells us that wisdom never needs to shout. Patience and silence are powerful. There are such lessons here in how to interact with others in calm, respectful, and yet assertive ways - even when tempers flare, things get personal, or when one has to stand up to a bully with a big mouth. In one of my favorite moments, when a bigoted juror (Ed Begley) is going on about ""those kind of people"" in clearly prejudiced ways, his fellow jurors quietly get up and turn their backs on him to show their disdain, and even those who agree with his vote do not support him. In another great rebuke, when Begley asks the immigrant watchmaker (George Voskovec) why he's being so polite, he responds ""For the same reason you are not; it's the way I was brought up.""The film also affirms the importance of the American justice system, and by extension, other countries with trial by jury in one form or another. Flawed though it may be, the concept that one must be found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury of one's peers, and that the decision must be unanimous - that it's better to let a guilty man go free than to convict an innocent man - is fundamental to a functioning democracy. How fantastic it is when Fonda's character states these points so simply and clearly. However, with that said, the film shows that this system only works when it's 'run' (or participated in) properly. Justice and democracy require thoughtful participation, and are not things to be dismissed quickly so that we can resume our lives, and in the case of Jack Warden's character, get on to the baseball game. It's a wonderful moment when Voskovec, otherwise relatively quiet, chastises him for his backward priorities while another man's life hangs in the balance. From these moments we can infer that the film is a criticism of those who avoid jury duty by pretending to show bias or conflict, and though it may be a stretch, you can apply this to other important civic duties as well, such as voting.It's to the film's credit that while there are a few who spew bigotry and bully others, everyone makes valid points about the evidence they've heard, including the loudmouths, and that's part of what makes it so gripping. Sifting through these points and reaching consensus is a big part of the film. The flow of the discussion is intelligent, with the natural questions or responses to an argument vocalized by one character or another. There is such rawness and realism in the dialogue, and we wrestle with the facts ourselves, and feel the weight of it all. We see the importance of rational, careful thought, but also the importance of understanding others, and not just the defendant or witnesses in the case, but the jurors themselves, who all have their own backgrounds, and in some cases, their own baggage.If all of this sounds too heavy or moralistic, I apologize, because it really isn't. The performance are natural and brilliant across the board. There are powerful emotional moments, but there is also humor peppered throughout the film. When Fonda's character queries Marshall's own ability to recall events from past evenings, we hear Warden quip in the background ""When you get to New Year's Eve 1954, let me know."" Before the advertising man (Robert Webber) puts forth an idea, he says ""Let's throw it out and see if the cat licks it up."" These types of lines not only make the characters more interesting, but they also add realism. It's telling to me that while Lee J. Cobb comes across as the 'rival' to Henry Fonda, and he is quite bombastic in several emotional moments, it's really the cold, factual juror (E.G. Marshall) who really needs to be swayed at the end, and it's a discussion of reason against reason. Cobb is the last juror to change his mind, but the final discussion is really between Marshall and Fonda. Marshall admits that Fonda has ""made some excellent points"", but then reminds him of the eyewitness testimony, and then says ""what do you think?"" Civility and decency are triumphing, and it's a metaphor for the only hope for man.The ending is absolutely brilliant, with the jurors returning into the streets to head back to their twelve separate lives, having performed their civic duty. Director Sidney Lumet shows incredible restraint to not then cut to 'what actually happened' on the night in question, or to a plot twist, or to some outcome good or bad (e.g. some of type of feel-good fanfare with the young defendant weeping tears of relief, or a horrifying realization Fonda has when he somehow finds out that he's let a killer go free, etc). There's none of that, and quite simply because they've done what they're meant to do, and justice has been served.",12 Angry Men
51,g-bodyl,Keeps You On the Edge Of Your Sheet!,9,11 March 2014,"This film, 12 Angry Men is famous for it's use of only one interior location for the duration of a film. It's a hard challenge to make a good film in only one location, but it works for this film. It's also known for it's disappointing box office and the critical acclaim it has received. Personally, I enjoyed the film because it does a great job building tension as the film progresses and it makes you what will happen next. It doesn't need action or explosions to old your attention, it has the proper characterization to hold your attention.Sidney Lumet's film is a courtroom drama on the outside, but on the inside it's more about a debate amongst jurors on reasonable doubt on a case about a kid who supposedly murdered his father.This film requires great acting and that it has plenty of. With only one bankable star in Henry Fonda, the cast manages to pull this off. Each character has their own unique identity and each identity is prevalent here. Their emotions are essential to how this film leads up to it's big ending.Overall, this is a great film and a great character study. It's a film that people in film school should be required to watch. It's all about the little things here since each of them count. We don't know anybody names, but we come to get to know these characters. It's as if we are there in person watching all this unfold. A great film indeed. I rate this film 9/10.",12 Angry Men

54,secondtake,"Compact, vivid, progressive--not a civics lesson, but a study of human nature",9,26 September 2009,"12 Angry Men (1957)What makes a movie shot almost entirely in a single room so compelling? It isn't the built-in civics lesson, even though it does make you glad for the jury system. Even more than the apparent plot about twelve men and their deliberations about a crime, there is a plot about human nature. The men are all etched just enough to become types--not stereotypes in a bad sense, miraculously, but kinds of people we recognize. And with amazing economy, the strengths and flaws of those kinds of people, simplified too much for reality but compressed just perfectly for the movies, become the guts of this play of passion.It doesn't hurt that the editing is supremely crisp, the continuity is spot-on, and the casting is brilliant, if color-blind (see below). It also doesn't hurt one bit that the cinematography by Boris Kaufman (see On the Waterfront), is that really clear, dramatic black and white photography of post-noir 1950s. It's beautiful and startling, showing at times the interactions of the group in the room as a whole in a kind of walking ballet, and at other times close-ups of hot faces straining to come to terms with the other eleven people in the room. In other words, this is a technically virtuosic ensemble piece, cast and crew, top to bottom.As viewers, it is this coming to understand people that makes us part of the scenario. We might see ourselves or our friends in these people, but even if they are strangers, if they seem a full half-century away from our own types, they are still people we are curious about. Sitting on a jury, being locked together in a room, and having to decide about the execution of the accused, all of this makes you grapple with personalities and motives quickly. There is not getting around deciding--both on the verdict, of course, but also on what kind of men are in the room. Why are they voting one way or the other? What makes them stubborn, or wise, or clever? Or funny, annoying, selfish?The all white male jury is potentially a problem. It should have been a problem back then, when planning the movie, and it becomes one now because the movie represents history, whether or not it likes it. After the Civil War (by amending the Constitution, and with a Civil Rights Act in 1875) it was illegal to exclude blacks from juries, and this was tested in court many times (often in the South). New York City could easily end up with an all white jury (and downtown Manhattan it isn't unlikely) but it is surely conspicuous for a movie trying to represent the sweep of humanity in a single room. Likewise with women, who by the 1930s were regularly part of New York City juries. In the 1950s, white men might have been more clearly enrolled on the lists used to select jurors (such as voting lists), so again, an all-male white jury isn't so unlikely, just conspicuous.Having said all that, I think the movie works partly because on some simple level, the jurors are all the same! To have made them more clearly diverse would have changed the way we saw them get to know each other. Having one guy be from a ""slum"" and know about knives is revealed slowly, and we can't really outwardly distinguish that man from any other. Even the one clear immigrant has assimilated. So 12 Angry Men isn't an accurate capsule or a documentary exercise, but a study in types and countertypes, reactions and resistance to action.Director Sidney Lumet cut his teeth for a decade with early t.v. and when he ventured into movies (this was his first success) he did so with a visual reaction against the flatness and static cameras of much of that medium, back then especially. He and Fonda worked together notably in Fail-Safe, another politically charged drama in black and white (and one where Fonda is again trapped in a small room). And later, in Dog Day Afternoon and Serpico (both starring a young and amazing Al Pacino) he again uses a highly charged external problem to deal with psychological responses that are even more intense. I want to live long enough to see this movie in 2057, just to see if it holds water once that period is looking quaint and distant (the way 1909 does to us from here). Already, as much as this is a fabulous, inspiring, vivid movie, it is also showing its seams, its contrivance, and its agenda too clearly. For now it's a concise dramatic masterpiece.",12 Angry Men

57,ironhorse_iv,12 Angry Men doesn't made me angry. It makes me think. It's one good movie.,9,19 November 2013,"12 Angry Men is one of the best plays turn into movies films ever. 12 Angry Men was adapted from a teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose by director Sidney Lumet. There is no music score, no action scenes, no sex appeal, but this movie is one of the best, due to two reasons: great writing, and great acting. One thing that I love about this movie is how little locations there are in this film. Beside the opening scene, most of the film takes place in a room made up of 12 men jury as they deliberate the guilt or acquittal of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt. They must stay there, until they can be make a unanimous decision. To add to the pressure, the room goes from hot and humid to warm, and cold, making each character go through a chain full of emotions. The way, the film is filmed is amazing. It shot in a way that makes the room feel a bit claustrophobia. Since there is a lack of locations, the character of the film had to be very interesting people, and they were. Like the title says, 96 minutes of the movie is pure intense arguments between a group of men whose personalities ranges from quiet and good-hearted to outright anger and hate. None of the jury members have their real names mention, as most are refers to each other by a number given to them beforehand. When you think about it, nobody name was used in the film; the defendant is referred to as ""the boy"" and the witnesses as the ""old man"" and ""the lady across the street"". The film use anonymity as a way to make the film more a general representation of America. These are everyday people that could very well be on your jury. This sense of anonymity raises the stakes of the play as a social drama, in that is a more general commentary of our society. Who were these men is still a mystery? We only get a glimpse of what they do in their real life. They soon become acquainted with the personalities of each other and want to vote. Some of these men believe that the young teen killed his father in a fit of rage but only one juror, Juror Number 8 (Henry Fonda) is not certain beyond a reasonable doubt that the young boy did it and felt they should talk more about it. The jury soon came head to head with clashing of arguments and questioning of the evidence. Without spoiling too much about it, I have to say the heated discussion of evidences is the best part of the film as find out more about the true personalities of the jury members. All the actors did a great job. Henry Fonda does a great job as Juror 8, as the lone man wanting to convince his peers to evaluate the matter beyond their initial, largely emotion-based judgments to determine what the kid really did do. He does this, by explaining the murder weapon and the faults of the two witnesses. Still, I doubt, even in 1950's standards, a jury member can carry a knife in a jury room. Ed Begley as Juror Number 10 is chilling as the loudmouth racist whom based on the locality where the accused lived. Lee Cobb as Juror #3 is painted as a father who allows his poor relationship with his own son to influence his judgment of the case gives one hell of a performance. Last, worth noting is Jack Warden as Number 7, a sport fan who cares more about a baseball game than the case that he is given. While the others jurors members, are interesting characters, none of them were as great as these 4 men who brings the best out of this play. Throughout the play, we see two opposing views of justice which I love. The two-sided nature of justice create tension and contrast the characters. Each character wants ""justice,"" but what justice becomes unclear and fluid throughout the course of the play. If I can find one fault in the film is how the movie makes Henry Fonda seem like the protagonist and everybody else the antagonist. We don't know if Juror 8 is right and yet, his actions are framed as an act of bravery, standing up against the group to do what's right. In the end, of the film in a chilling reverse of roles, Juror 3 is view as a stubborn man, refusing to come over to the side of reason. What's really interesting about the case within 12 Angry Men is that we never ultimately find out for sure whether the accused is guilty or innocent. It's up to question. People even today, still have open debate about if the boy did the crime or not. In modern terms, most likely the results would happen, is a mistrial assuming, of course, that applicable law permitted the content of jury deliberations to be revealed. It's one of the few movies that make you think. The film should be view by anybody going to Law, but not only that, but regular people in general. Yes, the film is a bit outdated, and younger people might not want to see a black and white film with old men yelling at each other, but I think once they mature enough, they would find this movie great as well. If not, this movie. They can watch the 1997's remake of 12 Angry Men. That version is also pretty well done. There is a lot of things that people can learn from this film, like issuing dealing with class, racism, family relationships, psychology and communications. It's really hard to hate this film.

63,zkonedog,A Portrait Of Humanity,9,8 March 2017,"When rating the greatest films of all-time, ""12 Angry Men"" usually ends up close to the top of that list. This is for good reason, as the lasting impact of this masterpiece will forever be its portrayal of humanity in all its various guises.For a basic plot summary, ""12 Angry Men"" picks up after the trial of a young man charged with killing his father. Eleven jurors are ready to convict the boy and call it a day, but one man (played by Henry Fonda) has a reasonable doubt about the case and refuses to make the vote unanimous. When the jurors get to discussing the case, ""Fonda"" finds that he may have more supporters than he originally thought as he lays out his doubts.Set basically in one locale (the juror deliberation room), director Sidney Lumet puts on a master class of introducing the principle actors and slowly easing viewers into their various quirks. This portrait of humanity is so powerful that it carries all 90 minutes of run-time.For a few examples...-A couple of jurors are downright intimidated by the tougher-talking members.-One juror is sick and wants to get out of the heat, while another has tickets to a baseball game ""burning a hole in his pocket"" and thus wants to hurry along the proceedings.-Yet another juror is prejudiced against young people and wants to see them all in ""the chair"".Only Fonda is tough enough (in a performance every bit as courageous as, say, the one given by Gregory Peck in ""To Kill A Mockingbird) and honest enough to stand up to his peers and not back down.It certainly helps that the acting in the movie is incredible. Nearly every juror is a great character actor and they all bring something a little different and unique to their respective roles. With names like Fiedler, Cobb, Klugman, Warden, and Begley (to name just a few), this is a true tour-de-force cast.Overall, ""12 Angry Men"" deserves its place among the film classics.

One man believes he is not guilty and attempts to convince the rest of the jurors of his innocence. This is, without a doubt, one of the best dramas ever created. Nice short runtime, small cast, all filmed in one room...it's just so tight!! The beauty of it is that just from dialogue alone we are thoroughly entertained and it maintains a sense of tension throughout. The crime is never re-enacted, it's from the descriptive dialogue that we picture it in our heads. Writer Reginald Rose knew that the most powerful tool in film (at that time) was words. The cast was high calibre, Henry Fonda leading the view of not guilty...it's pretty difficult to go against him when he is full of suaveness and so convincing. We get to know each juror as the film goes on and we soon start to explore the possibility that their personal lives are tainting their decision. That, was what made it so palpable. It was clouding their judgement, and their stubborn personalities made it all the more satisfying if they did change their mind. Persuasion is a powerful tool, but add a hint of conviction and you can manipulate anyone's mind. Several nice details were included, I like the fact it was set on the hottest day of the year. The heat evidently getting to the jurors, it made them more irritable and heightened the angry emotions within. Director Sidney Lumet did so much in such a little space, technically. When the jurors enter the room, its a sublime long five minute shot and he manages to share the screen time with each juror equally. He was able to convey their personalities instantaneously just by their attire, then when the discussion commences we start to dig a little deeper.

Saw again in 2005 n then again few days back on a DVD. 12 Angry Men is a film that has aged incredibly well, offers fantastic performances, fantastic dialogues and a film that can be watched over and appreciated more and more each time. This movie shows in a marvelous simple way the mechanism of the justice system, how easily a man can be convicted to the death sentence based on prejudice, subjective declarations of witnesses and an unprofessional defense lawyer. Everything is good about this film. The screenplay by Reginald Rose (The wild geese, Escape from sobibor) is top notch. The direction by Lumet (Dog day aftnoon, Network, The verdict ) is excellent. It must be appallingly difficult to shoot an entire movie in such a small space, but Lumet does it superbly and the camera work is awesome. All the actors really got into the skin of the character n they portrayed their moods n emotions very well. Henry Fonda (The grapes of wrath, Once upon a time in the west, The longest day) n Lee J. Cobb (The exorcist, On the waterfront, Mackenna's gold) were awesome. So were the rest of the cast. It is a groundbreaking and timeless masterpiece of cinema, showing just how much can be achieved from a mundane premise. Well, so long. (Joseph Sweeney).",12 Angry Men
70,l_rawjalaurence,Powerful Remake of the 1954 Television Classic,9,25 March 2016,"Based on the classic 1954 television drama of the same name, TWELVE ANGRY MAN was director Sidney Lumet's first feature, after a career in television. It was also the first (and only) film that star Henry Fonda also produced, apparently he grew quite frustrated with the responsibilities associated with the role, even though he enjoyed the acting task.Shot in only nineteen days after an intense rehearsal period, TWELVE ANGRY MEN makes effective use of the confined space of the jury- room. Lumet employs different types of shot to convey the increasing sense of tension, ranging from the close-up, the two-shot and the tracking shot as well as the basic shot/reverse shot sequence. Through such strategies we focus on the jurors' faces as well as their reactions to one another. It's clear, for example, that Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb) cannot stand Juror #8 (Fonda); not only are they ideologically poles apart, but Juror #3 cannot stand what might be described as the ""bleeding heart liberalism"" that prompts Juror #8 to question whether the accused was guilty or not. Juror #3's frustration is signaled as his face becomes more and more contorted and his voice rises into a high-pitched scream as he discovers that no one appears to listen to him.The shot/reverse shot strategy works most effectively in the confrontation between Juror #4 (E. G. Marshall) and Juror #9 (Joseph Sweeney), where they discuss the effect of wearing glasses. We watch Juror #4's air of self-confidence gradually evaporating from Juror #9's point of view, until Juror #4 is forced to alter his judgment.Stylistically speaking, the film is divided into three movements. In the first, Lumet shoots most of the action from an aerial perspective; this has the effect of belittling the characters, almost as if their discussions were unnecessary in light of the verdict. In the central section the characters are shot from eye level; hence we become more and more interested in their reactions to one another. In the final act Lumet photographs them from below, with the camera looking up at the characters; as we see the ceiling of the jury-room behind them as they speak, we feel that the situation is becoming more and more claustrophobic as previously-held prejudices are broken down and the characters' true natures revealed.The film comes to a dramatic climax - which is not in the 1954 version - as we understand why Juror #3 has been behaving in such extreme fashion. The reason has little or nothing to do with the case in hand, and everything to do with Juror #3's familial struggles. In light of his collapse, Fonda's long speeches (delivered slightly earlier on) about the importance of fairness and tolerance appear even more pertinent.Even after nearly sixty years, TWELVE ANGRY MEN still packs a punch, not only in its analysis of the American judicial system and its emphasis on being innocent until proved guilty, but also for its stylistic brilliance, as Lumet shows just what can be done with a confined setting, a superb photographer and a brilliant art director (Boris Kaufman, Robert Markel).",12 Angry Men
71,Movie_Muse_Reviews,A brilliantly filmed drama exploring human nature and the basis of morality,10,6 August 2008,"96 minute film with all but 3 minutes taking place in the same room: that's daring. It's hard to believe, but director Sidney Lumet finds a way to make ""12 Angry Men"" move at an attention-holding pace while being hardly dull at all. Now that's film-making. Lumet's camera techniques and the phenomenal performances from the actors he captures makes ""12 Angry Men"" a terrifically interesting court drama that is so elemental but so profound.In the opening minutes, a 12-man jury breaks into deliberation over a case where a teenager has been charged with killing his father. If found unanimously guilty, the boy will be executed. After a preliminary vote, every man votes guilty except for one juror played by Henry Fonda, who is afraid of being too quick to reach a verdict.The story basically paints a picture of 12 strangers. If you follow closely, you can learn a lot about these people, but the point is that you learn a lot about them and what makes them tick as they argue and reason. The first thing achieving that requires is great acting. This film is loaded with classic actors of the 40s and 50s. It's hard to really single out one performance as the best, though certainly Lee J. Cobb as Juror #3 is the most dramatic and he very much helps give the story an adrenaline boost when his character acts out.But the most excellent aspect of this film, what pushes it above a lot of other drama, is Lumet's directing choices in what is his first feature film. Filming in one room, it can be easy to put little thought into camera angles and movement, but Lumet considers everything very carefully and no single shot in the film feels arbitrary. The camera moves with incredible purpose, zooming in at perfect speeds and picking angles that best reveal the characters. Also, his attention to the idea of the heat in the room, the impatience, the confinement, all comes across in his directing. His angles start above the actors in the beginning and thus more impersonal, but the camera lowers more and more as the film goes on. You're so interested in the story at this point that you don't even notice, but you feel it. Lumet makes you feel much like a 13th juror and you begin to form your own opinion, bouncing back and forth (that is if Lumet and writer Reginald Rose did their job right, which they do.)The film is--and this really isn't a spoiler--without a climactic payoff for those that need a little something more or a resolution or mystery solved. You're supposed to find it satisfying in the way that it reveals a bit about who we are and how we arrive at the moral conclusions we make. You're supposed to learn so much about these characters that by the end you're shocked that you never even learned their names. The film is like a social experiment on screen and it's very realistic and yet still very interesting. It's an absolute marvel for being stationary, dialogue-heavy film. ~MMRVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com/",12 Angry Men

73,Anonymous_Maxine,"""Prejudice always obscures the truth.""",10,26 April 2008,"It seems that the message of 12 Angry Men (above) comes across as the film's only weakness. It starts with the very close of a trial that we never see and convenes immediately into the jury room, where we spend the rest of the movie. It seems an open and shut case, and by a show of hands, there are 11 jury members convinced that the defendant is guilty, and a single man who believes not that he is NOT guilty just that there is a CHANCE that he's not guilty. The film's weakness comes in because it seems that every single person who believes the kid is guilty ultimately reveals that they have some kind of personal vendetta and want to secure a conviction regardless of the sureness of the truth. The problem here is that people who believe in guilty are bad guys (and they rarely let you forget this, as one or two of them increasingly show off as brutish jerks, while the calm, endlessly likable Henry Fonda heads up the good guy side. Maybe the movie should have been called 11 Angry Men instead.There is also a certain level of ham-handedness involved in the initial presentation of how little the case means to most of the jurors. The story is about how important such legal cases are, because the decision that they make in that room will change someone's life forever, and it is absolutely imperative that they make the right decision. But at the beginning, all of the jurors have their minds somewhere else. They're talking about sports or their jobs or some other casual subject, and it takes one brave juror to stand up to the rest and get them to pay attention and think about what they are about to do.Sidney Lumet, in his book Making Movies, gives us invaluable insight into his goals and experience making 12 Angry Men, including the positioning of the camera (watch for the appearance of the ceiling late in the film as the tension mounts) and his brilliant use of lighting. Late in the movie, as the jurors remain in the room until darkness falls outside, it is so gradual and so cleverly done that we don't even realize the movie is getting darker and darker until they flip the lights on, and when they do, it's not just the room that is lighting up.The performances themselves have not aged well, but it is a brilliant analysis of some facts that seemed to so obviously point to one foregone conclusion, although I have to say that the film's other weakness is that a lot of the facts that they re-analyze (or analyze for the first time) should have been ridiculously obvious in the original courtroom trial. The jurors question for the first time, for example, the eyesight of the case's key eyewitness, who claims to have seen the murder take place at night and through the windows of a passing elevated train. I should hope that such a situation would have been scrutinized more closely by even the most inexperienced defense attorney, but maybe that person was secretly hoping for a conviction, too. At any rate, the film is a brilliant achievement, given that it is so engaging even though it literally never leaves the room. It reminds us of the importance of certainty in trials, even when the result seems completely obvious. The end of the movie is perfect, as there is only one way that it could really end (and I don't mean the jury's final decision), and yet it is not predictable. This is one of Lumet's most glowing achievements.",12 Angry Men
74,thinker1691,The Lonely Juror,10,23 May 2007,"One does not expect an ordinary black and white movie like ""Twelve Angry Men"" to set the foundation for great drama. Nevertheless, superior drama is what is delivered in this film. The setting is; a common courtroom in an eastern metropolitan city where twelve ordinary men have been selected to sit as a jury. The trial is over and the verbal testimony having been heard, the jury must now decide the fate of the young man on trial for his life. A common enough occurrence in America. But what is not common, is the mixed assortment of characters assembled for the jury. The real drama unfolds when a single juror (Henry Fonda) takes his task seriously and challenges each of his fellow members to think and then decide before they vote for the death penalty. When he does, the volatile reaction is nothing short of inspirational. One can only wish the same would happen to anyone facing a similar ordeal. The cast of characters is a vintage performance from all. Henry Fonda's performance is wonderful and courageous. He is joined by veterans actors, Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Ed Binns, Jack Warden, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Voskovec and Robert Webber. The honor of Classic fits this film like a velvet glove. *****",12 Angry Men
75,freemantle_uk,Taut Legal Thriller,9,1 September 2009,"12 Angry Men is one of those films with a high reputation, high in the IMDb top 250 and a rare 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. I too think its a very good film.The premise for the film is very simply, a jury of 12 men much decide on whether an 18-year-old man is guilty of murdering his father. If they find him guilty then the defendant would be sent to the electric chair. The film is set in a small room, on one of the hottest days of the year in a New York Court. The jury at first vote that the man is guilty, all but Juror #8 (Henry Fonda). He believes there is enough reasonable doubt and it is up to convict them of that, looking at all the evidence, witness testimony and pretty much the whole trial. Juror #8 is a righteous man who is trying to do the right thing, give the man the fair trial he deserves. He gains allies along the way and they are sympathetic characters, but they are rivals, especially the hostile Juror #3 (Franchot Tone), who is convinced of the man's guilt.12 Angry Men is based on a play by Reginald Rose, and it shows with excellent dialogue, a tight plot and great character development. It's writing at its best. The director Sidney Lumet, keeps the film within it play roots, keeping the film in a close, claustrophobic environment, like a real jury would be under. They are some wonderful shots and close ups, especially at the beginning when follow many different conversations in one continuous tracking shot for 5 minutes. Lumet knew how to work the camera, use the script, keep the tension going and gets the best out of his actors. This is a strong debut from a legendary director. 12 Angry Men is also great example of an actor's film. You believe in these actor's performance and all of them are on the top of their game, matching each other. Henry Fonda said this is one of his favourite films. Some of the characters are likable, some unlikeable, but all are real.The film also raises questions about legal ethic, the American legal system, the American constitution and is international in its message to any country that has trial by jury. It shows many different sectors of American society at the time.",12 Angry Men
76,Polaris_DiB,Great directing supports strong performances,9,3 April 2006,"For a movie based mostly in the necessity for repetition and seeing both sides of the issue, it does not, like it would seem, make one tired of hearing the phrase ""beyond a reasonable doubt."" This is an issue of objectivity, the idea that has taken centuries of philosophers to finally understand doesn't exist in a subjective standpoint. I can say nothing about this film that isn't repeated, with full clarity, in the dialog under many different contexts. They hold a man's life in their hands, and in the process are going to learn a lot about what must go into the proof.To be a bit honest, and a little hesitant, I must say that a lot of it strikes me as pretty liberal. I think this film is strongest when it doesn't get into politics, so the constant repetition of the phrase ""bleeding heart"" kind of gets to me. However, it's something of a necessity, because one of the things that these characters have to overcome is personal politics and prejudice to figure out where exactly to take a stand and where to leave be. And as a product of its time, it's immensely profound.What I like most about it is that it is not a criticism of the American system, it's actually in full support of it. If it criticizes anything, it criticizes the people who take it aloofly and don't understand the power they hold when they operate within said system. Responsibility is something I personally find quite lacking currently, and it's nice to see a movie expound the virtues of personal responsibility towards lawful conduct. This does not mean falling into hegemonic status quo, for that would mean the boy dies because nobody takes the time to question him. This means making sure you understand what you know and what you can't know.Beyond the writing itself, the directing and the acting really shine. It must be appallingly difficult to shoot an entire movie in such a small space, but Lumet does it superbly and the camera shows the audience EXACTLY what it needs to know when it needs to know it. It's art to be beheld. Also, all of the actors maintain their characters and the characters' mood swings amazingly, making it fluid and above all, very real.--PolarisDiB",12 Angry Men
77,PWNYCNY,The jury system is far from perfect.,10,3 October 2011,"If there is any movie that more plainly dramatizes the need for a major revamping of the jury system, this movie is the one. This movie dramatizes in no uncertain terms the chaotic process associated with trying to determine guilt or innocence. Instead of being impartial, the jurors are guided by their emotions and most openly admit that they really cannot determine the truth of the case. This movie completely underscores and conforms the need for a professional jury system. The present system is so messed up that now almost both prosecutors and defense attorneys will do almost just about anything to avoid a jury trial. They are the experts and they know that once a case go to a jury, anything can happen. This movie is great because the story is completely plausible. Jurors ready to fight each other; jurors who are angry, who really have no interest in deciding the case other than just to get it over with; jurors who are projecting their own emotions onto the defendant or prosecutors. In short, this movie most effectively and succinctly highlights the glaring imperfections in the system of justice that is structured in such a way as to almost guarantee that mistakes will be made, and that is because the jurors are laymen and are being asked to apply complex legal principles to cases that often hinge on circumstantial evidence. Although the cast includes major stars like Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb, it's really an ensemble cast. Ed Begley gives a fantastic monologue, ranting and raving, a really classic performance. After watching this movie, one can better understand why cases are plea bargained. It has nothing to do with ensuring justice; it's just a way to avoid having to go to trial - by jury.",12 Angry Men
78,ackstasis,"""Wherever you run into it, prejudice always obscures the truth.""",10,1 January 2008,"Take a classic film and strip it down to its bare necessities. Gone are the extravagant sets and sweeping camera-work; removed are the lavish visual effects and epic story lines. What we are left with is cinema in its purest form, where acting is the sole driving-force of the narrative, and our attention is retained through the director's thorough exploitation of a bare-bones scenario. Sidney Lumet's debut feature-length film, '12 Angry Men (1957),' is quite simply one of the most arresting motion pictures I have ever seen, a veritable melting pot of gripping performances and impassioned monologues. With the exception of its bookends, and a brief scene in an adjacent washroom, the entire film unfolds exclusively within the one stifling, increasingly-claustrophobic jury room, as a group of twelve jurors {all male, mostly middle-aged and middle-class}, with vastly differing attitudes and prejudices, debate the innocence or guilt of a young Hispanic man charged with the premeditated stabbing murder of his father.Prior to 1957, director Sidney Lumet had already acquired some experience in television, though it wasn't until he released his first feature film, a low-budget offering shot in only 17 days, that he began to attract the attention of critics. Though '12 Angry Men' was commercially unsuccessful {in an age of lavish, technicolour adventures, David Lean's magnificent 'The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957)' was more to the taste of audiences of the day}, the film received three Oscar nominations, for Best Writing, Best Director and Best Picture. Of course, it was Lean's epic that won each of these categories, among numerous others. Lumet's film, adapted by Reginald Rose from his own 1954 Studio One teleplay, explores the fairness and infallibility of the American judicial system, and the ways by which personal prejudice may affect the outcome of a criminal case. Though the film opens at the conclusion of the hearing, as the apparently-bored judge (Rudy Bond) offers his final instructions to the jury members, the events of the trial are later recreated through dialogue, without ever resorting to cumbersome flashbacks or heavy-handed narration.What ultimately makes '12 Angry Men' such an electrifying viewing experience are the incredible performances of the twelve main actors, each player delivering a distinct, perfectly-pitched characterisation that contributes richly towards their jury's deliberations on the court-case. Central to the story, of course, is Juror #8 (Henry Fonda), the lone dissenting member, whose unwillingness to send a conceivably-innocent man to the electric chair forces the other jurors to reconsider their stance on what had initially seemed an ""open-and-shut case."" Fonda, who also co-produced the film, gives a sincere and righteous performance, his actions assuredly heroic, despite the very real possibility that he has helped a guilty criminal escape from justice. The remaining players (in clock-wise order around the juror's table: Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Ed Binns, Jack Warden, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Voskovec and Robert Webber) each contribute with faultless performances, though some play a more significant role in the proceedings than do others.It would be plain naïve to label any one of the twelve jurors a ""villain,"" but the man who clashes most frequently with the Fonda's well-meaning dissenter is Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb), a loud-mouthed and temperamental bully, whose failed relationship with his own adult son has given him an overwhelming prejudice towards young people. Rather than deciding the murder trial based on the evidence, Juror #3 subconsciously relies on his own tremendous bias to settle the eventual fate of the accused man. Equally bigoted is Juror #10 (Ed Begley), whose astonishing partiality is fully revealed in his final manic tirade against lower-class citizens. In one of the film's most brutally powerful sequences, the remaining jurors callously rise from their tables in response to Juror #10's deplorable outburst, his confidence shattering as he realises that he is alone in his narrow-minded views. Also interesting is Jack Warden's Juror #7, an impatient salesman, whose complete indifference to the fate of the Accused prompts him to alter his vote in favour of the majority.Despite working in an extremely confined space, Lumet certainly makes the most of his minimalist setting, and cinematographer Boris Kaufman {who also worked on 'On the Waterfront (1954)'} employed lenses with gradually-increasing focal lengths to make it seem as though the walls were closing in on the characters, heightening the ever-present sense of claustrophobia. Lumet is a master of creating mood, as he also demonstrated in his finest film, 'Fail-Safe (1964),' and there's a certain, illogical urgency in the jurors' proceedings, as though Fonda's character is continually fighting a losing battle. Though some of events of the jury room would technically not be allowed {Juror #8's extra investigations  purchasing the knife, pacing the old witness' journey to the door  would undoubtedly have resulted in a mistrial}, the discussions in the film work merely to prove a single, all-too-significant moral: according to the Constitution, the Accused can only be convicted if there exists no reasonable doubt of his guilt. Ultimately, whether he actually committed the murder or not is almost beside the point, particularly when the life of a potentially-innocent man is hanging in the balance.",12 Angry Men

The film was made in defense of an insecure legal system, showing how a jury of one's (all too human) peers, sidetracked by prejudice, laziness and impatience, can still deliver an impartial decision after considering all the available evidence. The drama is played out in real time, and with real emotional power, building considerable tension out of the conflicts between each character (many of whom would likely never have been selected for an actual jury in the first place). Credit Reginald Rose for the elegant simplicity of his original screenplay, and 33-year old Sidney Lumet (making his feature film debut) for the all but invisible direction, maintaining the punch of the original story (a stage play originally written for television) without it seeming at all like a claustrophobic, one-set theater piece.",12 Angry Men

But it is.,8,25 October 2019,"A movie that is basically one long conversation which would normally be a bad idea but it's a conversation that is had every day and the outcome determines the life or death of a person.I was cynical about this picture. Often people swoon over a movie just because it's conscientious and has a good message at the expense of actually having an engaging or intelligent plot.Well I would say we do have a plot in a very meaningful way. While we have so many dramas on TV about cops catching lawbreakers, this movie tries to depict something unlikely, a person doing something the digital age knows more than any is a hard thing to do: change someone's mind.There really isn't a dull moment. All the factors and the variables from the actual logistics of the crime itself to fiercely well thought through and convincing examination of our numerous kind of biases (from racism to something actually even more haunting) all come together in what is nothing short of a feat of writing. I've never seen anything like it. It loses no power for its age, it only gains it in face.Every character is rich, three dimensional and plays with amazing competence. The performances keeps it visually interesting but they somehow managed to give a cinematic feel with their cramped location without going overboard.I'd recommend it even to people who don't like movies made before 1964.",12 Angry Men
85,estebangonzalez10,The jury is now in session!,10,27 June 2012,"¨It's always difficult to keep personal prejudice out of a thing like this. And wherever you run into it, prejudice always obscures the truth. I don't really know what the truth is.¨ 12 Angry Men is one of the best courtroom dramas I've seen despite the fact of it being filmed way back in 1957 in black and white and happening almost entirely (except for the opening 3 minutes and a few seconds in the end) inside an enclosed room. So why is this so good? Because Reginald Rose came up with an excellent story, which he wrote as a play first and was later turned into a movie under the direction of the great Sidney Lumet. This was actually Lumet's first feature film and among his best movies all time, although it wasn't received really well when it first came out. This film paved the way for Sidney who in the 70's made one great film after another (Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon, and Network). 12 Angry Men works thanks to the strong characters that are introduced in the story starring Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb. In order for a film in an enclosed room to work you need a very engaging story with interesting characters and that is what Rose was able to do. Many great plays have failed to perform well in film, so credit has to be given to Sidney who managed to maintain the tension and suspense in the movie. As the film moves on the enclosed room seems to be closing in on each character, and this was achieved really well by Sidney. The dialogue in this film is really powerful and authentic as we see how each character interacts with one another. Sidney manages to let the action play out through words because the entire film is one giant deliberation between these 12 men.The film opens in a courtroom where we hear the judge say his final words before sending the 12 men in the jury to deliberate over whether the accused young Spanish American is guilty or not of murdering his father. He reminds the jury that if they find the teenager to be guilty then he will be sentenced to death. The 12 men enter the jury room where the rest of the film takes place as they deliberate whether or not the kid is guilty. Everyone seems to have made their mind up and believe he's guilty even before beginning to debate the issue. The first thing they do is vote and 11 of the 12 men believe he's guilty pointing to the clear evidence, but Juror #8 (Henry Fonda) claims to have his doubts. He isn't sure the guy is innocent, but he has reasonable doubts so he asks the rest of the jurors to deliberate about it for the next hour considering that the young man's life is in their hands. Once the jurors begin to debate the issue the more difficult the case becomes and doubts begin to creep in all over the place. The rest of the jury is played by Martin Balsam (#1), John Fiedler (#3), Lee J. Cobb (#4), E.G. Marshall (#4), Jack Klugman (#5), Edward Binns (#6), Jack Warden (#7), Joseph Sweeney (#9), Ed Begley (#10), George Voskovec (#11), and Robert Webber (#12). The debate escalates as tension builds and the jurors begin to grow impatient over one another's arguments. The small room and the heat also seem to play an important factor in the story.One of the greatest things about the film is that it actually serves as a case study as how small groups work and how important communication can be in these scenarios. Many of the jurors entered the room with prejudice and had their own conceived ideas, but sometimes in order to find the truth you have to discuss the issue as objectively as possible. As the men debate we see how all of this plays out, and Reginald Rose writes the story in such a way that it begins to unfold through the conversations these men are having about their own views. There is no mention of names (except for the final scene where we hear the name of two of the jurors), but we do find out a lot about each character through the way they think and act. Their personalities are very different and that always makes it hard to have everyone agree with each other. This is why the film is used in so many business and communication schools today. These characters are well crafted and we might even have come across a couple of these jurors in real life because their personalities and views are still very much alive in the 21st century. Overall I believe this to be a great film and a must watch for all cinema lovers. It is really well executed and one has to admire the talents of Sidney Lumet and Henry Fonda who have left us with their rich legacy.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",12 Angry Men
86,jimbo-53-186511,12 Character Studies,8,9 June 2015,"A teenage boy is on trial accused of murdering his father. At the end of his trial, the 12 members of the jury (lead by foreman Martin Balsam) retire to the jury room to reach their verdict. It initially seems like an open and shut case, but when eleven out of the twelve jurors reach a verdict of guilty with only juror number eight (Henry Fonda) reaching a 'not guilty' verdict, juror number eight takes it upon himself to try to convince the other jurors that the case against the teenager may not be quite as open and shut as it seems.On the surface, 12 Angry Men seems to focus on whether the teenage boy is guilty of said crime. However, if you scratch beneath the surface this film isn't really about whether the teenager did or did not commit the crime, but rather it focuses on the notion of making sure that he gets a fair trial. Henry Fonda as Juror number 8 is the initial dissenting juror, but if you observe closely he never actually says that the boy is guilty or innocent, but merely offers reasonable doubt to counter any arguments or objections that are raised by the other jurors. Of course, predictably one by one the 'guilty verdict' jurors start to come round, but despite this the film is still involving because it's interesting to see how Fonda will convince everyone - clearly some men are more difficult to persuade than others, but I just found how Fonda achieved this to be fascinating and ingenious.One could perhaps argue that it may be a bit contrived that a juror with no legal experience could convince his fellow jurors of a seemingly guilty mans innocence, but I think to criticise this film for doing that would be missing the point. I think the point here was to try to remind us that just because we're told that something is true or that we want to believe that it's true it doesn't necessarily mean that it is true. Reasonable Doubt was clearly the pivotal factor in this film.I'm all for a good character study, but here we actually have 12 character studies. Despite its meagre running time, 12 Angry Men does enough to develop each character sufficiently. All 12 Men are from different walks of life - some of submissive, some are loud, some are aggressive, some are leaders - it all just felt so real and gritty and I must admit that I was immersed in almost every aspect of this impressive drama.I really don't think there's much more that I can say other than I'm glad that I watched this film and also that I found it to be a tense, involving and thoroughly enjoyable 90 minutes.",12 Angry Men
87,sauravjoshi85,A must watch classic,9,20 August 2019,Twelve angry men is a courtroom drama directed by Sidney Lumet. The film is an adaptation of a teleplay by Reginald of the same name.The story tells about jury of 12 men who discuss the conviction or acquittal of an 18 year old boy who is charged for the murder of his father and as per US in criminal case the verdict of jury must be unanimous.This is one of the most beautiful and edge of the seat movie with great acting direction and screenplay.This is one of the most thought provoking movie which is beautifully and majorly this movie shows us nothing of the trial but only the 12 jury members and their arguments.This is undoubtedly one of the entertaining court room drama which is a must watch.,12 Angry Men
88,barnabyrudge,Should be in everybody's list of top ten movies.,10,13 January 2004,"12 Angry Men is one of the movies which doesn't particularly divide audiences: virtually everyone agrees that this is a masterpiece. What is amazing is that the film is set wholly in one location, yet for its entire duration it maintains suspense, interest and topicality. Not a line is wasted, not a character is underdeveloped and not a single minute is surplus to requirement. Twelve jury members retire to a jury room to debate the innocence or guilt of a young kid accused of murdering his father. Eleven of the men are ready to return an instant guilty verdict. The one thorn-in-their-side is Henry Fonda, who isn't totally compelled by the evidence he has heard and who wants to debate the case a little more. Slowly but surely, he raises points and possibilities which get the other eleven men considering whether or not the murder is really such a straightforward open-and-shut case. Sidney Lumet directs the film with claustrophobic brilliance. The sweltering hot weather adds to the mens' frustrations and leads to some vociferous and provocative confrontations. Fonda is excellent as the liberal jury member who dares to invite ridicule for his seemingly untenable opinion, but he is upstaged by the extraordinary performance of Lee J. Cobb as the most aggressive and sharp-tongued of his rivals. There are superb performances also from Jack Warden as a juror who isn't especially bothered about the verdict as long as he can get to the baseball match on time; John Fiedler as a softly-spoken juror whose opinions often go unnoticed; Martin Balsam as the self-appointed spokesman; and Robert Webber as a rather self-conscious ad executive. Indeed every juror is played to perfection, and in some ways it is unfair to single out one above the rest. The script by Reginald Rose is pure genius. The whole story is told via talk - there's no direct action and no fancy flashbacks - yet it is enthralling from first minute to last. See 12 Angry Men. This is what film as a serious medium is all about!!!",12 Angry Men

90,JoeKarlosi,12 Angry Men (1957) ***1/2,9,29 September 2004,"For viewers out there who don't like ""old movies"" or ""black and white,"" please give this gem a try. I think you'll find it completely engrossing. It's a masterful piece of work, expertly directed by Sidney Lumet and contains no sex, explosions or special effects, not even a single female (it's still worth it!). Flawlessly acted by fine performers: Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Ed Begley, Jack Warden, Martin Balsam, Jack Klugman, etc. The simple setup involves only 12 jurors in a little juror's room, nothing else. It's the power of the story and the interaction between the varied personalities of these men that keeps you riveted. It's why less can be more when it's done well.SPOILERS AHEAD:It's perfect symmetry the way these men each have a personality all his own: the liberal, the bigot, the wise man, the jerk, the haunted man, the immigrant, the hard worker, the know-it-all, etc.... During the course of this film we get to know them all, maybe can identify with one or two. There's an air of Political Correctness which tends to favor the liberal side, painting the ""guilty"" voters as racists, loudmouthes with personal agendas, or ignorant sports fans. It's because of this (and more objections) that I'm hesitant to award the movie a complete 4-star rating. It's a ""great"" film, but I just cannot call it ""excellent"" when I can't seem to side with Fonda's noble cause. From the moment we see Fonda (Juror 8) in angelic white, he's a ""do-gooder"". He ""says"" that he does not really know if the young defendant is innocent of killing his father, but his facial expressions and sighs of relief tell me he had his mind made up to free this boy all along. Fonda even goes out of his way to buy a knife - BREAKING THE LAW IN DOING SO - just to plead innocence for the kid. He constantly asks jurors: ""isn't this possible?"" but the same could be asked by other jurors and their ideas. Our justice system is a scary mess. because I believe ANY murder case can have ""reasonable doubts"" raised in them, if someone wants them to. So no witnesses are ever to be considered reliable? Luckily for the kid here, one of the jurors wearing glasses scratched his nose, so there's an instant case for ""reasonable doubt"" because a juror recalls that a female witness also rubbed her nose (maybe she wore glasses). There is a lonely old juror who observes that an elderly witness seemed lonely and ashamed. So this juror ""relates"" to him and decides that the old witness may have wanted to ""appear important"" and so maybe his testimony was unreliable! A truly guilty man could get released by this! Whenever Fonda wants something to fit his agenda for ""not guilty,"" he believes the old witness' every word; when it won't help his cause, he dismisses his feeble testimony! There's a crude re-enactment where Fonda hobbles around to determine if the old witness was able to get to his door in 15 seconds as he testified - it actually takes 41 seconds - but is this as conclusive as Fonda claims? Maybe the man was mistaken when he said ""15 seconds""; maybe the man said ""50"" . Fonda doesn't care; this is one of those times he'll trust the man's testimony if it proves his agenda! He sure works awful hard to ignore anything the other jurors suggest. The boy claims he was at the movies when the murder was committed, yet one hour later cannot recall anything about the films he watched. How does Fonda chip away at this evidence? He tests juror E. G. Marshall by asking him if HE recalls what HE did last night. When Marshall easily replies, Fonda goes back to the night before. Marshall still doesn't miss a beat, so Fonda goes back a couple more days (why doesn't he just go back three years?) until he's back to a week. Naturally, Marshall eventually can no longer remember, so a ""point"" is supposedly made (um, not really). Is Fonda correct that some of his points are feasible? Yes - but so are the others'. ""Juror 8"" won't give up until the kid's life is spared, it seems. Even when the ""guilty"" voters suggest to ""have a hung jury,"" Fonda will not accept. It's not good enough for him. Here's the key to me that Fonda's not interested in a ""fair verdict"": Jack Warden votes ""not guilty"" with all the others, just because he doesn't care and wants to get out. If Fonda was so self-righteous, he should have gracefully said: ""11 of us have now voted 'Not Guilty'. But I cannot accept the 12th vote, as this man is only voting for whatever verdict will let him get out of here"". But Fonda will take it -- the boy's free, even if he had to get one ""fake"" vote to achieve it.We have to give the benefit of the doubt. I don't want an innocent man executed. But nor do I want guilty predators freed because a witness ""had lines on her nose,"" or ""maybe that witness lied to feel important."" When Fonda says ""this isn't a game!"", it seems to me the jury system IS a game - who can think of a twist the fastest, who has the best lawyer. I think Fonda plays a ""game"" very well and won - even if society lost. Because when he marches out of court at the end, thinking he's a hero, I can't help thinking he let a killer fall through the cracks to satisfy his own conscience. Still, I wish I could side with him. I think this is a more fulfilling film for those who do, and I believe we're supposed to. Either way, this is a very powerful piece of cinema. That's the main thing.***1/2 out of ****",12 Angry Men
91,slokes,Once More Around The Table,7,21 July 2008,"A courtroom drama which spends about a minute inside an actual courtroom, ""12 Angry Men"" defies expectations in other ways, too, most particularly by not being a star vehicle despite starring Henry Fonda.It's a bit of a Trojan Horse, too; screenwriter Reginald Rose making his case against the death penalty by showing a kid who appears guilty of having stabbed his father in a moment of rage and encouraging us to root for jury nullification, a la OJ, because he shouldn't have to die for his crime. If the charge wasn't first-degree murder and execution not concomitant with a guilty verdict, we might see the pesky Mr. Davis (Fonda) and his tireless ""supposing"" not much differently than does angry Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb).""It's now your duty to sit down and try and separate the facts from the fancy,"" a supremely bored judge tells the jury at the start of the movie.But a lot of ""fancy"" gets tossed around in the jury room, not just ethnic slurs from Juror #10 (Ed Begley) and baseball chatter from Juror #7 (Jack Warden), two solid early votes for conviction. Much of the fancy comes from Davis himself, who asks the other jurors to accept an odd set of coincidences and aspersions in order to ignore the stubborn fact that someone walked into a man's apartment and stabbed him to death with the same kind of switchblade that had belonged to his angry son.""This kid's been kicked around all his life,"" Davis says. ""He's had a pretty miserable 18 years. I think we owe him a few words.""Does anyone really believe this should work? Well, in ""12 Angry Men"" it does, aided by Rose's clever manipulation, Sidney Lumet's seamless but unshowy directing, and a performance by Fonda that demonstrates his egoless mastery of the screen acting craft at its near-height. The supporting cast is great, too, even the underdiscussed ones like Ed Binns' salt-of-the-earth painter #6 and Robert Webber's marketing whizkid #12, who apparently invents Rice Krispies before our very eyes.The script does have its weak moments, none worse than when #10 goes off on his unfortunate diatribe regarding ""them"", in which all but two of his fellows leave their seats and symbolically turn away from him. A Richard Thomas stage production I saw handled this awkward business more cleverly. The music is a collection of ugly off-notes, and much of the background chatter is unconvincing.""12 Angry Men"" does have terrific setwork and piercing character moments, like how stuffy stockbroker #4 (E.G. Marshall) sniffily ignores #3's attempt to hand him a business card. Cobb as #3 is stuck with the most over-the-top moments, but sells them well. Cobb could yell with the best of them, and proves it here.But ""12 Angry Men"", while a good movie, is not great film, pushing a dubious rooting interest for a killer's freedom. Maybe he doesn't deserve to die, but ""12 Angry Men"" stacks the deck too much in his favor to be called high art.",12 Angry Men
92,gcd70,Rewarding and thought provoking,7,7 February 2008,"A youth from an underprivileged home stands trial for the murder of his father with whom he had a strained relationship. Circumstantial evidence seems to have convicted him beyond any shadow of a doubt. Yet as the jury retires to consider its verdict, one man chooses to look further than the boy's background, and in examining the prosecution's case, he finds both the 'proof' and the witnesses to be less than satisfactory.Reginald Rose's compelling story is first and foremost an excellent character study of ""12 Angry Men"" who all find their moral fibre put to the test when asked to decide the fate of a young street kid accused of a terrible crime. Each from very different backgrounds, the audience witnesses first hand as every man's true character comes to the fore under such pressure. The film also examines mankind's prejudices toward not only the youth of today, but also the less fortunate and the ethnic community.Director Sidney Lumet (""Murder on the Orient Express"") creates tension and claustrophobia very well in the small, hot jurors room where the ""12 Angry Men"" struggle with both their verdict and their own moral values and personal convictions.The whole cast is very solid, especially Henry Fonda who delivers a stand out performance as the architect who just isn't convinced of the boy's guilt, and slowly but surely he starts to win some support for his arguments. Also superb is Lee J. Cobb as a bitter and biased man who is determined the lad should hang. Great support too from Ed Begley, Martin Balsam, EG Marshall and Jack Warden. A most rewarding and thought provoking movie.Sunday, February 19, 1995 - Astor Theatre",12 Angry Men
93,EUyeshima,Powerful Ensemble Performance in Still Potent Jury Room Drama,9,1 August 2006,"With the recent deaths of Jack Warden (just this past week) and John Fiedler, only Jack Klugman survives from the original 1957 movie cast of this blistering, uncommonly well acted drama, a triumphant first feature for now-revered director Sidney Lumet. Written by veteran TV scribe Reginald Rose, the story takes place almost entirely within the confines of a Manhattan jury room. Already overheated by the scorching weather, the twelve men are locked in heated debate over the fate of a ghetto youth accused of murdering his father. Over the course of ninety minutes, we get to know the individual personalities of the jurors in ways that surprise even themselves in a most claustrophobic setting.The chief battle occurs between Juror #8, who believes a comprehensive discussion of the evidence is necessary before coming to a verdict, and Juror #3, who is convinced it is an open-and-shut case. The drama unfolds as the others move from one side to the other, as questions of objectivity and neutrality are put to the test with each character. It certainly helps to have a sterling cast of familiar faces inhabit the roles of the nameless jurors. Henry Fonda plays Juror #8 with his becalming dignity constantly stretched by the ongoing pressure of a fast verdict. Never the most subtle of actors, Lee J. Cobb is a blustery force as Juror #3 as he slowly reveals his own personal issues leading to his seemingly intractable guilty verdict.E.G. Marshall plays the cold-blooded elitist stockbroker, while Edward Binns is the inarticulate house painter intent on maintaining a sense of fair play in the room. Warden is a small-time hustler only interested in making the baseball game, Fiedler (later memorable as the meek Mr. Peterson on ""The Bob Newhart Show"") is the eager bank teller who demands to be heard, Martin Balsam is the overly accommodating foreman uncomfortable in his role as the foreman and Robert Webber is the glad-hand pre-yuppie willing to go with the crowd.The most vivid impressions are left by Ed Begley's unapologetic racist, George Voskovec's dignified watch maker, Joseph Sweeney's seemingly befuddled senior; and Klugman's shy juror who more than anyone else, comes to empathize with the accused. The film's one slight flaw is that it tips its hand at the outset with the tone of passivity emanating from the judge and the wide-eyed fear in the accused's face. The black-and-white film comes in a clean print on the 2001 DVD but little else except the original theatrical trailer. A masterful work of economy and escalating dramatic tension.",12 Angry Men
94,MarieGabrielle,Just as applicable today...timeless,10,22 July 2010,"Having watched this film again last evening for at least the twentieth time, it struck me how this film has so much to it that is real and important, each character reflecting an attitude of society. Racism, intolerance, rage, hatred, class distinctions, family discord. It is remarkable that each trait and character is so clearly developed and reflected on film. A newer version has been made for HBO which includes women, not sure what the jury selection criteria was in 1957 but apparently women were not considered for jury duty as often.Henry Fonda is of course the standout as fair-minded and intellectual architect, a reflective man who sees the flaws in the judicial system and wants the case to be considered on its own merits. Jack Warden as the selfish yet humorous baseball fan irritated that he is missing his Yankee game. Robert Webber as the man in the gray flannel suit, not wanting to make waves. Ed Binns as a working man who at first needs convincing by Fonda. Ed Begley as a hateful racist who could care less whether a man is executed unjustly for a crime he didn't commit. Lee J. Cobb, as a man alienated from his own son after beating him, who takes out his rage on the accused. Jack Klugman as a man who grew up in ""slums"", as they were then called, and has compassion for those who survived it. E.G. Marshall, an analytical yet sheltered man who comes to see his own veiled prejudices have caused him to vilify the culprit.The young boy accused of stabbing his father was supposedly seen by several eyewitnesses, but their testimony is then questioned. The entire film is twelve men in a heated and uncomfortable sequestered jury, and their thoughts and reactions to the case. This film should be watched thoroughly to appreciate it: for instance when E.G. Marshall, who seems to be a fair and intellectual man suddenly realizes that yes, the witness which may send a young man to his death may have been mistaken.Do not miss, the remake has no such stellar performances. 10/10.",12 Angry Men
95,Enchorde,A classic!,9,13 May 2004,"** Here be spoilers **A young boy is accused of murdering his father. Evidence strongly points to him. The jury is sent out to make a decision, and they must be unanimous. As they sit down to vote, there are eleven guilty and just one not guilty. One man has reasonable doubt that the young man is guilty. The jury start to discuss the evidence at hand. Tempers flare, people shout and in general, the room contains twelve angry men.This is a masterpiece. A little slow at start but rapidly catching up, and most of the movie is very intense. You could actually cut the tension. As the story is in real time, you don't miss anything and can follow everything that happen. The tension comes from, that in their decision, lies the fate of one mans life. So simple, but at the same time very complicated. The director has done a great job along with the actors. All twelve people act very well within their character, and as they, and the camera move around I actually got the feeling that being in that room, wanting to take part in the discussion. What more can a movie-maker aim for. With the acting and the time-independent (the issue of evidence and life and death is just as real today, I hope) issue I really got involved with the movie. And the suspense kept growing. Not in the way that anyone was in danger or if any time limit would pass, but the simple matter of somebodies opinion and the change thereof made it so. Who will change their opinion next and why? It really seemed as a study of people.Great movie, action and suspense, great directing and acting and a very interesting topic!9/10",12 Angry Men

Henry Fonda plays the only sympathetic juror, who, in a domino effect, cites evidence and speculation to not only influence the verdict, but to have the others stray from mob mentality and form their own conclusions.  The way in which the film progresses, using a boy's life to springboard into issues of morality and even racial prejudice, is very clever and well-done, complemented by strong ensemble acting.8/10",12 Angry Men
97,Steffi_P,"""Gambling on probabilities""",9,26 May 2010,"The 50s are known as the age of the big picture – the epics and the uber-budget monstrosities. But it was also the era when the Indy film came of age, and every now and then a mini-budget wonder peeped through between the tall trees of the major studios. And 12 Angry Men is quite literally a small picture, taking place almost exclusively on the one set. It's unusual that a production that is so minimalist in terms of locations is derived not from the stage (as was, say, Rope) but from an earlier television edition – testament to the growing influence of TV at that time.This is the cinematic debut of director Sidney Lumet, who has something of a flair for these claustrophobic little dramas (he also did the job on Murder on the Orient Express and Dog Day Afternoon). Already you can see him thinking about how to turn the one space into several different kinds of space. We begin rather objectively, with the camera holding back unmoving in a far corner as the jurors potter about. We then gradually close in, the shots becoming more personal. Crucially, the camera now often follows actors around as they move (especially the restless Ed Begley) to get that more aggravated feel to the shots. Finally towards the end the camera starts to pull back again, revealing the group dynamic as they spiral into heated argument. Lumet shows his inexperience (some shots don't match up very well, and the close-ups are too close) but essentially his ideas are geared in the right direction.Such a tight little drama calls for some first class acting. Henry Fonda gives a subtle, considered performance, showing with his face and general demeanour that he is really not thinking just about how to persuade the other jurors, but about the implications of the trial, and the life that is at stake. Fonda clearly understands that Juror #8 is not simply a man doing the job he has been called up for, but one who has found himself under the burden of an almighty responsibility. Lee J. Cobb gives a performance of great power, and one that is needed since it is really his character that ends up holding the emotional weight of the picture. Honourable mentions also go to George Voskovec and Martin Balsam for giving the most realistic and human portrayals of the other jurors.12 Angry Men is a hugely affecting and effective piece of work, not to mention a really neatly structured one. But is it perhaps sometimes a little too neat? It ought to be entirely believable, entirely smooth and unforced in feel, and yet too much of the dialogue seems so calculated. The writer's thought processes are too much on display. I'm talking, for example, about the way Juror #3 keeps saying something so perfectly hypocritical at exactly the ideal moment. And while it's true that each character must clearly represent a different attitude or segment of society, some of them are embarrassingly stereotyped, and the twee acting styles of Joe Sweeney and John ""Winnie-the-Pooh"" Fiedler don't help. None of these things is a big enough flaw to bring 12 Angry Men tumbling to the ground – don't get me wrong, this is still a mighty picture – but they do serve as a warning that the little pictures are just a susceptible to corn and gimmicks as the big ones.",12 Angry Men

Repetition assists clarity...It's an engrossing tale of 12 sweaty jurors cooped up in a hot and claustrophobic jury room trying to reach a unanimous decision on a potential murderer who's just been tried. Henry Fonda believes it's possible the guy is innocent, the other 11 initially don't. And that's all the background needed. It's marvellous watching the story unfold – more or less logically – but! The characters are really 12 Emotive Stereotypes: The 2 main well bred Thinkers just had to be the broker and the architect and not the slum dweller or the baseball fan, the 2 small businessmen just had to be the most interesting characters, not the old man or the clerk. The stagey and sporadic irrational emotional outbursts would make an agreement unlikely in the real world and yet it's carried by both the sincere and insincere at the finish. Where did Lee J. Cobb go to when everyone was theatrically getting up from their chairs and turning their backs on Ed Begley's right wing frothing? His chair was empty during this very contrived scene but not just before or after, presumably because it would have looked a little incongruous if he'd stood up too. And I concur with Fonda's glib comment that the defence lawyer couldn't have been very good!However, it's still a classic and a film I owe a lot to: it made me realise from age 13 there's often more lurking under the surface than above, and in all probability nothing is impossible.",12 Angry Men
101,Spleen,Gets everything right that matters,9,1 July 2002,"Here's an illustration of the difference between theatre and cinema.  This is the definitive cinematic ""performance"" of Reginald Rose's play; the one or two trivial flaws are of no consequence whatever.  On the stage, they WOULD be of consequence.  As E.G. Marshall performs the role, Juror nr. 4 is so humourless and anal that you start to wonder if he's really all that bright (and the story requires that he really IS all that bright).  And Henry Fonda tends to play Juror nr. 8 from moment to moment, in effect contradicting himself (if you find yourself failing to warm to him as much as you should, this is the reason).  THE two key performances, in short, are weak.  On stage this would be fatal.  On the other hand, with STRONG performances all round, ""12 Angry Men"" on the stage could not possibly go wrong, however much the director takes it upon himself to stuff things up - just as the stage director of ""Don Giovanni"" can make a donkey of himself by setting the action in present-day Darlinghurst, if he likes, and, with sufficiently good musical performances, the opera will not be harmed.If you exclude Ed Wood movies and the like, ""12 Angry Men"" was shot with as much economy as any other film in history, with roughly HALF of the exposed footage making it into the final cut (I find this hard to believe, too, but it's what the director says, and it's not inherently impossible).  No doubt accounts for the odd touch of unpolished acting here and there.  What's amazing is how perfectly Lumet has paced the action, how RIGHT each shot is.Lumet conveys the confined space all the more effectively by including thirty seconds, perhaps a minute of footage of the outside: the opening shot where we track into the jury room, and the closing shot in the open air outside.  These moments - which established there was a wider world while cutting the jury room off from it - were crucial.",12 Angry Men

103,onepotato2,quickly goes astray,5,3 March 2008,"For decades now, films about 'social issues' have been problematic; making conscientious viewers believe they've thought deeply about a noble cause, and getting them to applaud themselves for embracing some progressive value that they probably already support*. This movie, in considering the responsibility of jury duty, neglects a finer point (& a larger idea) which remains undramatised; the process of American justice is not designed to declare people innocent... it only concludes whether the prosecution succeeded or failed at proving a person guilty; this is reflected by the very specific terms, Guilty and Not Guilty. A suspect is freed when the prosecution hasn't made its case, not when the suspect is proved innocent. No one is ever declared ""innocent."" The difference is important (occasionally Not Guilty and Innocent are equivalent, but innocence is generally a higher standard). The jurors of '12 Angry Men' are confused about many things, but none moreso than this. The movie never clarifies this point. It would help these gentlemen immensely.At both ends of the spectrum - lynch mob to gee-whiz pushovers - the jury here utilizes thought-processes which are toxic to justice. The jerks are too interested in hanging. The 'bleeding hearts' - in the films parlance - are way too engaged in actively dismissing the whole case, not in merely detecting reasonable doubt. At one point Fonda has been able to discredit evidence (which is OK - a discovery supports this) and use a dicey method to disregard so much witness testimony (which is frankly, bizarre) that he might just as well start denying there was a victim, or that a crime occurred at all. ""What if the victim isn't dead?"" and ""What if there was no body?"" are only slightly more unreasonable than a few of his crazy, trial-negating suppositions.It remains a good idea for a movie. There are strong points (a moment when E.G. Marshall, as the reasonable opposition, quietly concedes is particularly powerful), and it's directed and shot well, but the script is so off-course that by the time the film ends most viewers will feel content that an innocent life has been saved, a moral determination not supported by the film, which is neutral concerning culpability. Worse, the offscreen case rings dramatically hollow when reassembled from the details we do get; it suggests some kind of flimsy, polemical courtroom, 'What on earth did these lawyers debate, if it wasn't the crime details? Was this a 4-minute trial?' I'm sure this movie had an impact on viewers likely to be called to jury duty, who WOULD prefer to wind things up so they could get to a ball game, but it does end up affirming that 12 people off the street are usually ignorant, and without some enlightened golden-boy on your jury (and a dramatic structure to reign them in) will hang your sorry ass. In a shocking example of tunnel-vision, the movie neglects to note that this nifty trick of persuasion might also be deployed by the morally un-righteous. To wit, couldn't just as interesting a scenario be imagined in which a juror whose motives are secretly nefarious, and who is intentionally trying to undermine the process, achieve the same reversal and get someone executed? Could one clever sociopath with a quick mind get a jury to reverse its verdict? That's a creepy, equally promising possibility which viewers aren't supposed to consider, but which is inherent in the premise, and which should have troubled a McCarthy-era audience. I think I'd actually like this movie if Fonda's moral value was left intentionally vague in the end, but it isn't. His righteousness is endorsed by heraldic music on the soundtrack and just so there's no mistaking his virtue, he walks away in a glowing white suit.This is only a good argument, not a good film. If you're the kind of viewer who prefers that there's no work to do to find a films meaning or your own nobility (Do you like To Kill a Mockingbird?), this is for you. There's no meaning to find, because none of it is hidden. It's all important on the surface. There isn't movie I love that's this overt with its meaning. 12 Angry Men is a nobility machine.

105,richard-1787,A masterpiece,10,1 September 2008,"The script of this movie was nominated for an Academy award. Why it didn't win it I don't know. Why it didn't win 10, or 100, or 1000 Academy Awards for the writing I don't know either. It is the most gripping script I have ever seen, and I have seen it several times.Even the best script needs good actors and a good director to have its potential realized. In this case, there were no impediments to that realization. There is not a weak link in the 12 actors chosen to play the jurors. Every one of them is perfect, every one of them gives a masterful performance.And they work together to create a masterpiece because the director did a masterful job of making this movie build to an unforgettable but completely motivated climax.Never in the history of Hollywood has a movie that cost so little to make been so great.=========================================Added 2 February, 2014:There are few movies I will watch more than once. There are even fewer movies that I will not interrupt when my stomach tells me it is time for dinner. This is one of those few. TCM ran it again this evening, and once I saw it on, I couldn't stop watching until the end.There is more great acting in this movie, and more great direction, than in a dozen other ""great"" movies. It's all great performances and brilliant camera angles to drive them home. A masterpiece.My question at the end, however: what happened in the life of the character played by Lee J. Cobb (spectacular performance) that caused him to hate the accused so?=========================================Added 21 July, 2019:I watched this movie again last night, and again was held riveted to my chair. Since I only see it once every few years, when I catch it on TCM, I forget the small but crucial details and so rediscover them again with the characters as the drama unfolds.This time, as I watched Fonda's and some of the other characters start to raise questions about the testimony of the old man and the woman across the street, I kept thinking: ""But why didn't the public defender raise those issues?"" And then I thought: but I didn't think of them the first time around, so why should he have? Among many other things, this movie shows that even without malice aforethought, a trial may not always defend those who cannot pay for a high-priced attorney to defend them.It also reminds us of an era not so long ago when men could speak truly hateful lines about minorities, or seniors, or ..., without any real fear of public shaming. It is not until the very end that Ed Begley's character, who seems to harbor every terrible prejudice about those different from him, is finally ostracized by most of the others for his you-name-it-phobic language. His character is the worst of the lot in that respect, but some of the others are bad as well.And there is the terrible indifference of some of the characters to the outcome of the trial, even though that outcome could be the death of a young man. At first, at least, they don't want to be bothered. Because he is different his life doesn't matter.Each of the eleven characters' road to doubt is fascinating. One I particularly noticed last night was E. G. Marshall's. His character is convinced by the facts that the young man is guilty, until finally one fact he knows from his own experience changes everything for him. He suddenly realizes he has been wrong. It is clearly painful for him to change, but change he must to be true to his image of himself.There are already over 1000 reviews of this movie here, so the chances of your seeing this one are slight. But let that number impress on you the importance of seeing this movie. Not just once, but more than once, so that you, like the characters, can start to see what lies in the little, not at first apparent details.",12 Angry Men
106,Movie-ManDan,The Best Courtroom-Drama Ever Made!,10,22 November 2014,"To Kill a Mockingbird garner the reputation as the best courtroom drama as it ranks the highest on most lists. It is a great film, I'll admit, but 12 Angry Men blows it out of the water. Funny thing is, this takes place in one room for 98% of the whole movie. There's about one minute in the actual courtroom in the beginning and one minute outside the building at the end. The rest is in the room where the jurors decide whether or not the defendant is guilty. When a movie takes place inside one room throughout the whole movie, the script has to be extremely strong and exciting. 12 Angry Men's script is those. It follows 12 very distinctive jurors who know that a Spanish-American youth murdered his father. All evidence gathered points to him, so all think that they can reach a guilty verdict right away. But Juror #8 (Fonda) is the only one that thinks the kid is innocent. One by one, Juror #8 convinces the eleven others that the young man is not guilty as they carefully analyze the evidence they were given. Each piece of evidence that is turned around is sheer genius and very thrilling. I actually consider this to be a courtroom- thriller because of how exciting it is. I found my heart rate rising at the site of each piece f the puzzle being put together. I could only imagine how this movie would have turned out if Alfred Hitchcock directed it. Fun fact: only two jurors' names are revealed at the very end, with the audience forgetting they do not know anybody else's names. Aside from this being very thrilling and educational, and having a great script and characters, it deals with themes of racism and family, as both play important roles on why the Jurors vote ""guilty"" in the first place.

It is also an illustration of human nature. People bring their own experiences and feelings to a case affecing someone else. The way the men deliberate and challenge each other is what should happen in any jury, truly look at the facts and arrive and the best decision possible. The beauty of this film is we didn't need to see the murder or even scene to visualise the murder. It's brought to life in a small room.

The dialog is razor sharp, the characters well-drawn, and director Lumet, cameraman Kaufman and editor Lerner have worked miracles with a cramped space that doesn't lose any sense of claustrophobia in the process. Although one can certainly take the message as having to do with inherent problems in having a death penalty as a rule of law, there is a deeper message still: does not justice, in a democratic society, demand of us to think clearly? to uncover and expunge our individual prejudices? to confront the enormous weight of responsibility as coolly and objectively as possible? If the answers to those questions must come up negative, then democracy is a false hope and we should abandon it and give ourselves over to the nearest group of elitists who can guaranty us bread and circuses.Right now, with a right-wing junta in power in Washington, many Americans seem satisfied with such a possible result; they seem to forget that the result would be the same under a left-wing junta as well. The hope of democracy is that government is neither left nor right, but every day, that it allows all of us some share in shaping our own destinies personally and collectively.""12 angry men"" is thus a film filled with hope - hope for ourselves, each as individuals, but also hope for our future, our children and the possibilities they represent.If this hope is false, it is still certainly preferable to any of the lies spewed forth by the American media today.",12 Angry Men

It's like the action film filled with special effects for the previous generation!

The movie is also a study of human nature. It's not just ""OK, we need 12 votes to release the convict or execute him."" The dialog is also tremendous. I've never heard a set of dialog this good since, maybe, ""Pulp Fiction.""The film is taut and, at times, suspenseful. The performances were excellent.

111,bkrauser-81-311064,Perfect within it's own confines,10,30 August 2011,"What can be said about Twelve Angry Men that hasn't already been said before with more eloquence. Sidney Lumet's first and arguably best feature has entered into the annals of film history and has been picked apart ad nauseum by critics, industry professionals and academics alike. Twelve men walk into a jury room eleven say guilty, the one played by Henry Fonda says not guilty; etc. etc.There is a reason for this however; not the least of which is the films enduring timelessness made all the more impressive by its subject matter. Made during the decline of the studio system, the film was an oddity onto itself. A tiny black and white film at a time of Technicolor, a principle cast of character actors at a time of A-list credit cramming, and a director who up until then stuck to television and stage. Still Twelve Angry Men was far from conventional and in many ways ushered in a new age of cinema. It can be reasonably argued that Lumet paved the way for Robert Altman, Sydney Pollack and John Schlesinger among others to make the jump from TV to features.Within its own confines, the movie is flawless. Most of the film takes place in a single room and most of the information pertinent to the case is told second-handedly. Despite this, the film has the tension of a modern day thriller and then some. The dialogue is so innately organic though never rambling and the characterizations are rich and detailed. The camera moves through the room effortlessly making enough cuts to keep things interesting without being distracting. Many large lugubrious epics wish they could keep things this interesting! The inspired script written by Reginald Rose is so fluid that it has been open to interpretation not all of which are good. Many argue that Fonda's Juror #8 manipulates the other jurors and is less a fleshed out character than a symbol of ivory tower intellectualism. Additionally the points he raises range from valid to a bit sketchy and he takes ""beyond reasonable doubt"" to extremes. I wouldn't put it quite in that context. I think just like everyone else in the room, Juror #8's choices are made based on his personal perspective. He feels compelled to push and push because no one else will. It's a character flaw that may not be admonished like the racial ramblings of Juror #10 (Ed Begley) but isn't legitimized by definitive answers either.However you interpret the film, Twelve Angry Men still remains a taut emotional roller-coaster, a thoughtful introspective and a brilliant character piece. I didn't even mention the wonderfully nuanced work of Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall and Jack Warden. It launched the career of a brilliant auteur and helped define an era in filmmaking that became the norm until the age of the blockbuster. Out of all the films of the period, this courtroom drama is with little doubt the most deserving of its reputation.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/",12 Angry Men

If there is any reasonable doubt of his guilt they are to return a verdict of not guilty. The judge further informs them that a guilty verdict will be accompanied by a mandatory death sentence.The jurors spend a short while getting acquainted before they begin deliberating. It is immediately apparent that the jurors have already decided that the boy is guilty, and that they plan to return their verdict without taking time for discussion—with the sole exception of Juror 8 (Henry Fonda), who is the only ""not guilty"" vote in a preliminary tally.

For example juror #7, he never puts his views to the test, his convictions doesn't change, he doesn't even want to hear evidence that might lead him to the truth, he doesn't want to discuss major issues, nor ask questions, he doesn't care about the life of a young man, nor his death, he only wants to attend a basketball game, to come out of the room where the temperature is favorable. We also have juror #3, a good example of those people who think they are taking the right decision based on their own convictions, but they probably don't realize that their attitudes are nothing but reflection of their own experiences, background and feelings that have been buried deep inside. We also have a juror who can't judge a charge away from his class and ethnic convictions, and we have one who doesn't care to participate in the first place, because he believes they will surely come to a right decision.

116,MartianOctocretr5,Magnificent,10,29 July 2006,"One of the all time greatest character-driven works in the history of film making. It's even more remarkable when you realize nearly the entire story (with the exception of a prologue and epilogue each less than a minute in length) takes place in one room.Henry Fonda, as the lone juror who stands for the acquittal of an accused murderer, is probably the best remembered performer, but his 11 co-stars turned in astonishingly powerful characterizations as well. It's a who's who of TV and film heavyweights, and no one misses a beat anywhere.The Black & White filming style echoes the story's simple, one-act-play origin, aiming your focus on the actors and their high-intensity lines all the way through. Clever elements like an oppressively hot room and later a thunderstorm add some symbolic salt and pepper, but the actors are all commanding your attention so well that you don't even need such measures. The jurors come from all walks of life, with their own views of the world and life itself: the result is a fiery encounter with sparks everywhere. You are drawn in from the start, and each character becomes a real person.Bigotry, broken families, ambivalence, self-focus, patriotism, loneliness, fear, confusion, apathy, pride, arrogance; these are just some of the elements explored in this microcosmic analysis of the human condition, and what makes us who we are.

117,sme_no_densetsu,Twelve angry men in one fine movie,8,25 August 2010,"In this, Sidney Lumet's debut feature, we're taken into the jury room as twelve jurors deliberate over the fate of a young man accused of murder. All of the evidence points to a guilty verdict but one juror is determined to explore every possibility for reasonable doubt, lest they send an innocent man to his death.One remarkable thing about this film is that it unfolds almost completely in real time within a single room. While that might sound like a limitation, Sidney Lumet managed to keep the visuals interesting throughout, resulting in a well-deserved Oscar nomination. Meanwhile, Reginald Rose's taut, Oscar-nominated script deserves equal credit for keeping the narrative flowing.Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, the cast is stellar. Henry Fonda turned in a solid performance in the lead role and all of the supporting actors gave it their all. In my mind, the standout performances came from Lee J. Cobb, Ed Begley & Jack Warden. However, the group as a whole is a diverse one and each of the actors contributes a unique piece to the puzzle.My only complaint (a minor one) is that the mechanics of the script are sometimes overly apparent, particularly in the early stages when Fonda's character supposedly has only a vague apprehension about certain pieces of evidence. Luckily, when the story unfolds it is compelling enough that I can forgive the screenwriter's dramatic license in setting up the events.At the moment this film is rated #8 among the top 250 films on this site. I think that it definitely deserves a spot on the list but the current ranking seems somewhat generous, especially when you consider that it's above the likes of ""Casablanca"", ""Seven Samurai"", ""Chinatown"", ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and several other highly acclaimed films. So, by all means, see this movie but don't be surprised if it doesn't turn out to be one of the ten best films of all time.",12 Angry Men
118,Howlin Wolf,"""12 Angry Men"" is a consistently fascinating film, but one where it's conclusions don't hold up in a lot of modern-day democracies...",10,17 February 2008,"I liked the observation that even juries can become suspicious of one another despite the fact that they're all working toward the same end, and since legal teams are all human they may still be subject to the same propensity to err as the rest of us. There were times however when I disagreed with the influences that brought about the verdict. One of those cornerstones is the notion of 'reasonable doubt'. Clearly this particular principal isn't applied as strenuously as the justice system says it ought to be in all cases that are heard today. My bet is that often these days verdicts are reached by the appeal of common consensus, and any apparent holes are ironed out by majority opinion instead of meriting closer inspection. As one juror says, you can use the counter-argument of ""supposing it happened this way?!"" for just about anything. If that is meant to be the clincher that makes adjudicators unsure, then almost nobody would be getting locked away even with lots of admissible evidence stacked up against them.Secondly, unlike on its first general release in 1957, the death penalty is no longer enforced in a heck of a lot of places. In a film where so much of the drama derives from a miscalculation in good faith being enough to condemn an innocent to death, the stakes are no longer quite so high in a lot of territories, which speaks well of the modern age. Now I'm not arguing that wrongful imprisonment is in any way some kind of a picnic, but when you have the facility of a seemingly endless appeals system that can be fully exploited by a canny lawyer, the intricacies of the justice system somehow don't seem quite so immediate or important anymore. We know that sentencing is no longer the final word, because we hear of judgements quashed and rulings overturned virtually every day.... and thirdly, does any ordinary member of the public nowadays really have the confidence to believe that a juror could be so observant to notice marks left by a pair of spectacles?! Many are probably on the verge of dozing off when testimonies are being heard, or at least they would only be listening to the account without having the alertness to take in every minute detail about the personage in front of them, as well. I would think that juries have fallen into a habit of working with details that are overtly given to them by officials, not scrutinising closely enough to allow for consideration of things that they happen to have noticed themselves.Whether or not such idealistic events are indeed credible in these times, ""12 Angry Men"" is unfailingly, rigorously intelligent in its deconstruction of deliberation. I only wish that in the real world we were without doubt certain to arrive at the proper outcome, so long as we made sure to follow all of the 'rules'...",12 Angry Men
119,schappe1,1954 vs. 1957,10,28 November 2008,"The Archive of American Television has finally come out with a DVD version of the original Studio One teleplay, ""12 Angry Men"" by Reginald Rose, directed by Franklyn J. Schaffner, who did many Studio Ones and much later was the director of ""Patton"". I can now compare it to the famous movie version, starring Henry Fonda, which was directled by Sidney Lumet three years later. A lot of the things Lumet gets credited for in some of these reviews are already present in Schaffner's staging, including starting with the high camera angle and ending with the close-ups.A key difference is that the TV version is only an hour long, (actually only 50 minutes due to commercials), while the film uses 96 minutes to tell its story. Some of the lesser characters suffer as a result. In the film Robert Webber's nice-guy businessman wants so much to go along with anybody else that he changes his vote simply to be part of the majority when the tide turns. In the Teleplay, we never learn why Will West changes his mind. Edward Binns as juror #6, is very protective of ""the old man"", Juror #9, (played by Joseph Sweeney in both versions), in the movie. He clearly sees him as a similar to his own elderly but beloved father. In the teleplay, Bart Burns is little more than a spectator, except for one key moment that has nothing to do with the old man.But the big difference is in the lead actor, Robert Cummings, (He was ""Bob"" in a comedy, ""Robert in a drama""), vs. Henry Fonda in the film. Fonda is, of course, an actor of much greater repute but Cummings was much underrated. He was a thoughtful actor in dramas, carefully weighing his words and inviting the audience to think along with him. As Juror#8, Cummings portrays a man who is not sure of himself as the beginning but wants to answer some key questions before he makes a decision. In the film, Fonda seems like a man who has already decided to vote ""not guilty"" from the beginning and is trying to figure out how to loosen up his fellow jurors from their stances so he can draw them over to his view of things. A key point is that fact that the lady who ""saw"" the murder through the windows of the train wore glasses. In the film, Fonda divines this by noting how E.G. Marshall, as juror #4 rubs his nose to deal with the irritation the glasses cause. It's the final piece to the mosaic Fonda is trying to create. In the teleplay, it is Burns' juror #6 who makes this point after watching juror #2 and this seems to be the final piece of the puzzle for Cummings who for the first time, has become firm in his decision to vote not guilty.His two antagonists are jurors #3 and #10. #10 is Edward Arnold in the teleplay, Ed Begley in the film. Both are good. The scene where #10 is ranting on about ""people like that"" is more effective in the film. It's just a matter of timing. On TV, the jurors get up and begin to walk away as soon as he starts talking. In the movie they do so more slowly, each one making the decision on his own. Franchot Tone, another underrated actor, (he started out playing charming men about town and wound up playing garrulous old timers), is just as strong and forceful as Lee J. Cobb. His true motivation, his resentment of his own son, is hinted at early but is not part of his breakdown at the end. In fact, he doesn't break down at all. He simply surrenders. He doesn't become Cobb's ""shell of a man"".As to the other jurors, Martin Balsam has more to do than Norman Fell as juror #1, the foreman. Martin's a nice guy who just wants everybody to get along. We don't' know that much about Norman. John Beal's role as juror #2 just calls for him to use his watch to time Cummings' performance as the old man walking and to wipe his glasses clean at the right time. Marshall came through a little stronger than Walter Abel as a relentless ""logic machine"" who can't think outside the box. Lee Phillips is solid as the shy young man, somewhat ashamed of coming from a disadvantaged background. Burns has little to do besides noting the significance of Beal's glasses. Paul Hartman is OK as the guy who wants to leave early, (he has tickets to the theater, not a ballgame). Much of the additional dialog in the movie goes to Jack Warden's version of this character. Sweeney and George Voskovic are the only two actors in both versions and both are fine, with Voskovic underlining the significance of this procedure to someone who came here to experience freedom. Missing though, is his empathy for the defendant as an outsider like him, which is emphasized in the film. West, as indicated, is a non-entity in the teleplay.On the whole, I'll take the movie over the TV original but it's a close thing. But the TV version, which was ""missing"" for many years, is certainly worth seeing.",12 Angry Men
120,pyrocitor,"""I don't know what the truth is. I don't suppose anybody will ever really know""",10,18 February 2009,"Generally the premise of twelve middle aged men locked into a room arguing would hardly be considered the basis for particularly riveting or dramatic cinema, with theatrical potential at best, but hardly dynamic or visual enough to appeal to a mass audience. It can only be considered merciful that such an attitude was not one shared by television director Sidney Lumet, who instead seized advantage of a myriad of factors which could have resulted in a catastrophic film (a solitary location, a hasty shoot, budget constraints) and somehow extracted from them an effort to which the billing of 'one of the greatest motion pictures of all time' would be a title hardly disputed by the general public. Lumet's persistence in the face of adversity suggests he may have scented something great in the making, and the raw energy and crackling intensity 12 Angry Men generates is a testament that such dedication was entirely justified. While the legal thriller is always a precarious genre, walking an uncertain line between being plausible in a real life context while avoiding being too slow and talky to appeal to an audience, Lumet centers in upon the inherent drama in the court setting, while consciously shying away from the tendency to approach such cases in black and white terms. What makes Fonda's Juror #8's solitary quest to sway his fellow jurors all the more compelling is the moral ambiguity of the situation. Fonda is not a white knight crusader unflappably convinced of the righteousness of his actions or the accused party's innocence - in fact, he openly admits that his actions may be resulting in the release of a guilty murderer. Instead, Fonda becomes a crusader for the ideal of truth and plausible evidence, notions that Lumet's film toys with throughout as its Rashomon-style construction of past events through various uncertain accounts becomes a more philosophical meditation on society's constant yearning for information and knowledge. Taking similar notes from Hitchcock's Rear Window, the film addresses the voyeuristic insatiable desire to be a privileged spectator, but crucially, just like the jurors, the audience is continually kept in the dark despite similar desperation to piece together a definitive account of the crime committed. Eventually the conclusion can be drawn that it scarcely matters in the end, as the facts of the case have become so twisted and warped by human preconceptions that only gut instinct and an earnest lust for honesty and justice can hope to prop up a system so reliant on fallible misconstructions. And although Lumet draws out the tension surrounding the eventual verdict to uncomfortably taut levels, by the end, the crux of the film appears to scarcely center around the court case itself anymore, the focus subtly shifting instead towards the men deliberating it. The jury's cross section of middle aged men serves as a microcosm for 1950s variations on masculine identity, slowly but surely sweating away their polished exteriors to reveal the flaws, prejudices and hatreds concealed underneath. Masterfully tackling sensitive thematic issues such as class and age discrimination (while the teenaged suspect is initially dismissed as being a dangerous youth, the elderly woman witness' testimony is similarly scrutinized due to her age) the film dares to expose the dark secrets lurking beyond the wholesome exteriors of 1950s society without ever coming across as excessively heavy handed or moralistic. Indeed, the film could hardly be farther from it, as Lumet's remarkable deftness of touch makes the picture riveting as much through its subtlety as its heated emotional grandstanding, using slyly inconspicuous zooms and tensely circling camera-work to unobtrusively underscore the white knuckled drama of the scene without unnecessarily wrenching emotion out of the scene or performers. Perhaps the film may be a few shades away from perfection, carrying a whiff of being overly coincidental and slightly unrealistic through having the jurors swayed one by one, but the unexpected moment of quiet humanity culminating the picture is a textbook example of the rare sort of uplifting ending which can ring true, and it is near impossible to dispute the raw power and honest intensity building up to that point, making the potentially dubious logic of the narrative easy to ignore and exceedingly difficult to resist. Such a dialogue heavy story relies upon hefty acting clout to achieve full effect, and Lumet's uniformly exceptional cast does not disappoint, with not a single performer in the delightfully colourful and versatile collection of characters delivering an unsatisfactory or unbelievable performance. No one could have been better cast as the stoic protagonist Juror #8 than the time etched monolith of American honesty and decency that is Henry Fonda, and Fonda radiates the ideal quiet confidence to draw in the support of the audience as much as his fellow jurors. Fonda's unassuming lack of pretension makes him far more than the traditional populist hero, and his eshewal of soapbox moralizing in favour of calculated appeals to reason make his message all the more plausible, and his character all the more timeless. Lee J. Cobb similarly shines as the abrasive Juror #3, with Cobb's fleeting moments of tortured humanity barely discernible under an appalling mask of unsavoury characterization making his role far deeper than a simply stubborn oppositional force, and far more resonant. Martin Balsam is also a noteworthy presence as the level headed Juror #1, with a quirky edginess underscoring his appeals for reason, bringing a potentially simply expositional character to highly watchable life. What could have made for a plodding, overly literary waste of time is instead transformed into crackling movie magic, bursting with barely stifled raw emotion and pulsing with social significance. 12 Angry Men is just about as sublime a legal thriller as one could hope to find, its reputation as one of the strongest American films of all time holding up, and the half a century since its release failing to dilute its power and abject fascination in the slightest.-10/10",12 Angry Men
121,frankde-jong,A courtroom drama without courtroom,9,18 January 2021,"""12 Angry men"" is one of the best films of all times. It is a courtroom drama without a courtroom. No smart retorica from lawyers this time. We got 12 ordinary citizens, designated by chance, who have to decide between life and death. At first some are inclined to answer this question on the basis of racism (""We all know how these kind of people are"") or pure indifference (""I have tickets for the baseball game tonight. I would like to make it on time""). One man however reminds all the others of the principle according to which someone is innocent until proven quilty. Does this man get allies? Is the accused boy (who we see only in a split second at the beginning) really innocent? The central message of the film is that this really are two different and seperate questions!""12 Angry men"" gives us superb acting and superb camerawork.Superb acting despite the fact that the film contains only one big film star (Henry Fonda who also financed the film, ...and yes he is that one man I talked earlier about).The rest of the cast contains premier league stage actors.Superb camerawork (Boris Kaufman) despite the fact that all the action takes place in one room. During the film the camera imperceptibly lowers her angle. While the discussion heates up the ceiling becomes visible and some sort of claustrophobic feeling gets grip on the viewer.",12 Angry Men

123,bobsgrock,Simply engrossing.,9,9 September 2008,"12 Angry Men is the tailor-made type of movie that was common in the 1950s but has become non-existent today. It is all dialog, relies heavily on acting, and is short but sweet in its running time. All this adds up to one of the most satisfying watching experiences available in the movies. Henry Fonda plays a juror who has a ""reasonable doubt"" that the boy they are trying might not be guilty. From beginning to end, no matter who is standing against him, he continues to vote not guilty.Slowly, but surely, Juror #8 begins to raise questions and doubts about the validity of the witnesses boy being and the evidence against the boy being accused of his father. Soon, more than just one juror thinks he may not be guilty, and this leads to some fantastic drama.For this type of movie, the two most important issues were handled very well. The acting is top-notch all around, especially Fonda as the quiet, gentle man who sees something wrong with how most of the jury takes the evidence blindly. Lee J. Cobb also sticks out as Juror #3, a man with severe personal problems that tend to influence his decision. The script is tight but very good at exploring all areas of the judicial system and the stereotypes many of us have about it. All in all, this movie very openly discusses the importance of life and how when it hangs in the balance of a group of men's hands, it should not be rushed into but rather thought out and analyzed.Sidney Lumet does an excellent job of pacing the movie and keeping the suspense all throughout right to the final shot. It isn't a movie everyone will enjoy, but for those who want something more out of their movies, 12 Angry Men says something and then some. One of the best court-room dramas ever made.",12 Angry Men

Despite being over 60 years old now, this is rightly still considered by many to be one of the best films of all time.Despite virtually the entirety of this film being set in one room, this has to be one of the most compelling dramas I've seen. For a film with such a simple format, it had me hooked from start to finish.The characters are fascinating, they all have depth and back stories, come from different backgrounds and walks of life and each have unique characteristics and personalities.

And back in the days of the 1950s, a lot of the movies that came out were fairly simple. ""12 Angry Men"" is one of the simplest movies ever made. Nearly the entire film takes place in one room and the cast consists of only twelve characters. Yet, even its simplicity proves out to be effective, for it is one of the most intense, dramatic motion pictures ever created and truly a great accomplishment for Sidney Lumet and leading actor/producer Henry Fonda. Also sharing the screen with Fonda are other famous names such as John Fiedler, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Warden, and Ed Begley.""12 Angry Men"" is also a film that becomes so powerful because of the way it develops its twelve stars. Every character has a background of some kind, many times a troubled one, as we see in real people around us. Fonda plays one of those characters that stands alone, bravely against a large opposing force and as he often states in the movie that he's not sure if what he's doing is really worth the trouble. The tension as Fonda tries to convince the eleven others to follow along with him develops to an incredible level with amazing performances by everybody and one of the best scripts ever written.

127,baumer,What an excellent film!,9,22 May 2000,"It seems as you grow older, you can appreciate older films more.  That does not mean that when I hit the age of 65 I will appreciate a film like Citizen Kane, but now that I am in my late 20's I have a desire to see some of the greats from years past.  Just five years ago I was too narrow minded to want to even try to appreciate older cinema and some of the screen greats.  But today I rented the 1957 classic, 12 ANGRY MEN and was not only pleasantly surprised, but I truly liked it and thought it to be quite a good film. 
What's quite fascinating is to see the change in political and social climates since the days of black and white film.  In this film, there were no black jury members, no women, and no swearing.  This was also, to be fair, probably the worst handled case in the history of trials next to the Warren Report.  Questions that today would be common place were avoided like the plague.  Evidence was not handled properly, very little effort was put forth by the defense to come up with a defense at all and witnesses were never thoroughly interrogated or cross examined to refute what can only be regarded as flimsy testimony.  But, not only was I not around in the 50's, I have no idea what the North American justice system was like back then, and perhaps that is what makes this film so interesting.  So I can only say that it is possible that a case could be handled this poorly, given its circumstances.  You would have to compare and dissect what society was like back then to get a true appreciation of what was and wasn't possible.  To talk about the film, yes it was very enjoyable.  It was a great film that unwound piece by piece all of the apparent infallible theories that pointed to the guilt of this kid.  The writer should be given a lot of credit for that.  But having said that, a film like this would never see the light of day with today's fickle audience that would rather see a film like Con Air than High Fidelity.  I am not critisizing today's audience for that, just pointing it out.  But the 40's and 50's were different.  Spielberg and Lucas and Don Simpson and Joel Silver were just little tykes then.  It was a different time.  A film that only talks and has no action was perhaps a possible sell back then with a cast like this.  Lee J. Cobb and Henry Fonda and Jack Warden must have been at the height of their popularity so that immediately leant credence and respect to the project.  But it wouldn't matter who did this film in today's age, it would not work.  Again, not a critisism, just an opinion.I think it is important to go back to the roots of cinema every once in a while to view some of it.  You come across gems like this and you learn to appreciate them.  12 ANGRY MEN is a fascinating film and it is one that serious lovers of film should watch every now and again to feel the aesthetic of film before special effects started to replace a good script and a good director.  Tarantino would appreciate something like this.  In his version of 12 ANGRY MEN, the 12 jurors would probably have names of colours and at the end they would all have grabbed Henry Fonda's knife and tried to kill each while uttering the F-Word in, but a film that prides itself on dialogue more than action is what he is all about.  This could be a pioneer of a Tarantino film project.12 ANGRY MEN is a great film and it is one that HENRY FONDA should have been proud of.  A wonderful experience!  And it is great to see some of his work, other than On GOLDEN POND.9 out of 10",12 Angry Men

129,telegonus,The Architecture Of the Human Face,10,18 December 2002,"I love this film, and watch it whenever it's on. It was adapted from a television play by Reginald Rose, and directed by Sidney Lumet. A deceptively simple story of twelve jurors who must decide the fate of a very young man who may or may not have killed his father. These men are a cross-section of American and in particular New York society, circa 1957, and range from the working to the upper middle classes; from the highly sensitive to the appallingly crude; and from those who think they're smart and perceptive and often are not, to those who think little of themselves and who really ought to rate themselves more highly. The play is so intensely written, and Rose had such an excellent ear for dialogue, that one often finds oneself caring more for the jurors than for the outcome of the case they're deliberating.At the start of the film, there is one holdout for not guilty against the eleven who believe, with varying degrees of sincerity and seriousness, in the guilt of defendant. It's the job of the lone juror to convince the rest of the logic of his position, which is one of reasonable doubt. It's here that Mr. Rose, or rather his lead character, plays fast and loose with the rules of evidence, as has been pointed out over the years; and while I'm generally a stickler for rules when it comes to matters that plays and movies are often reckless with, especially where medicine and science are concerned, I make an exception in this case due to the excellence of the writing, and of the movie as a whole. If ever there was an actor's film, it's this one. Every actor gives a superb performance. Some characters are better conceived than others, and thus John Fiedler, as the milquetoast of the bunch, and Ed Binns as the working man, are at somewhat of a disadvantage, no fault of the actor. Ed Begley's character, a bigot, starts out interestingly, then descends into somewhat of a cliche, which is too bad in way, since Begley was at the top of his game at this stage of his career. Martin Balsam's sighing self-pity is put to excellent use in his performance of a man who likes to coach football. George Voskovec is magnificent as a foreign-born watchmaker who challenges Jack Warden's loudmouth salesman. I've never seen Warden better than he is here. His character is a jerk and a joker, borderline Runyon, or rather the way Runyon types often are in real life: insufferable. Warden plays for effect rather than charm, and has a way of making other performers look good in their reactions to him, which tend to be unfavorable. E.G. Marshall is imposing as the icily superior stockbroker, oozing contempt for others while maintaining a facade of fairness. Not a bad man, just a snob, of the sort one encounters often in the real world, seldom in the movies. Lee J. Cobb is the juror with a deep personal involvement in the case, and becomes in time the nearest to a true villain (albeit a pathetic one) of the piece; while Henry Fonda's dissenter more or less wears the white hat. Cobb gives the sort of highly charged, emotional performance he gave in On the Waterfront, a bit quieter here, and not so malevolent. He was brilliant at conveying the demons of men who don't know they have demons. Fonda manages to be saintly with becoming sanctimonious. His character has the thankless job that liberals often take on, which is that of defender of the damned. One senses at times that the man would rather be elsewhere, that he's a tad too retiring for the this sort of thing.What I remember most fondly about the movie is its exploration of the architecture of the human face, often in close-up or medium shot. We see old faces and youngish ones, the craggy and the smooth, the granite-jawed and the slack-jawed. There are anxious faces with eagle eyes and lazy ones with drowsy eyes. Some faces smile automatically, others benignly, some not at all. With so much emphasis nowadays on action pictures, it would be good for young directors to study 12 Angry Men, to see just how much action there is in the human face. I'll take this one over Pearl Harbor any old day.",12 Angry Men
130,hnt_dnl,Watch it virtually EVERY time it's on!,10,1 September 2008,"1957! I've said it before and I'll say it again: What a year for FILMS! PATHS OF GLORY, THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI, SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS, GUNFIGHT AT THE OK CORRAL, and this film, 12 ANGRY MEN, possibly the best of the lot. BRIDGE won Best Pic, but personally, I would have given the award to either PATHS OF GLORY or this film, 12 ANGRY MEN. They are the only two films of the lot that I think are truly perfect. I've said that I would give PATHS an 11 if I could and same goes for 12 ANGRY MEN. It's hard to believe this was a director's film DEBUT! That's right, this is the FIRST film directed by the great Sidney Lumet, and perhaps his best. I'd say it is.12 ANGRY MEN is the most simplistic of tales: 12 jurors must decide the fate of a teen accused of killing his father. The entire film consists of these men deliberating, debating, conjecturing, and learning about the case. In the process, we the viewer get a valuable lesson in LAW 101. You'll learn more about the law and legal system in this 2-hour exercise than in any 100 episodes of LAW AND ORDER. So simple, so true. The film is so flawless in it's presentation that you swear that the entire 2 hours is one long tracking shot of the 12 men in the room.The film stars the great Henry Fonda (as Juror #8) as the lone juror who finds the defendant NOT GUILTY. Fonda must convince the other 11 men that the teen is possibly innocent, that there is a REASONABLE DOUBT. The process through which he does this drives the film and is enthralling from start to finish. As the film progresses, you learn about each juror and what makes him tick. The other 11 jurors numbers 1-7 and 9-12 are, respectively: Martin Balsam, William Fiedler, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Ed Binns, Jack Warden, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Voskovec, and Robert Webber. All actors are brilliant. Can't see an ounce of acting of showmanship in the entire film.I watch 12 ANGRY MEN virtually every time it airs and never feel like I've wasted my time. Now that's a great film!",12 Angry Men
131,classicalsteve,The Other Side of a Courtroom Drama,9,31 January 2017,"Most courtroom dramas tell the story of a trial, and typically most films of the genre center on the building of the cases, the trial in a courtroom, and the climactic moment the jury renders the final verdict. In ""12 Angry Men"", we see none of these aspects. We don't see the trial, we don't see the lawyers, and we don't see how the case was built. Almost the entire story is told in the confines of a jury room. The indisputable facts and the prosecution's case trickle in as the story progresses. There's a brief ""prelude"" where we see the courtroom, the judge, and a brief shot of the boy on trial for murder.This is the world of ""12 Angry Men"". Except for a brief courtroom shot and one other codetta scene at the end, ""12 Angry Men"" spends about 90 of its 96 minutes running time inside a claustrophobic room where the fan doesn't work and it's supposed to be the hottest day of the year. Twelve men from differing backgrounds and age groups are put together to determine the guilt or innocence of a young man accused of murder. Fairly quickly we learn that an older middle-age man was murdered in an apartment and his son in his late teens has been accused of the crime. Two witnesses during the trial testified it was the boy, a woman across the street and an older gentleman in an apartment just above the apartment where the crime took place.Without giving two much away, the story begins with an initial poll taken by the jurors. Almost all of them believe the boy is guilty, except one, juror no. 8 (Henry Fonda). The trial occurred over the course of six days and all of them seem a bit worn out. In addition, each juror seems to have differing agendas which start to rear their ugly heads. Juror no. 3 (Lee J. Cob) is one of two jurors who has a personal agenda about the trial. The other is juror no. 10 (Ed Begley) who constantly talks about ""those people"" and repeatedly stands from his chair when he hears evidence which might contradict the probably guilt of the accused. Juror No. 5 (Jack Klugman) is a soft-spoken young man who grew up in the slums, like the defendant. Juror no. 7 (Jack Warden) is a sports fan who cares less about the trial and doesn't want to miss a sporting event taking place in the evening. There's a kindly and wise older gentleman, juror no. 9, who turns out to have unexpected wisdom (Joseph Sweeney). And Martin Balsam plays the foreman of the jury who can't seem to keep the group from going at each other's throats.Juror no. 8 at first can't seem to convince anyone there's any reason to doubt the guilt of the accused. Even when he says he simply wishes to talk about the case, many of the jurors dismiss him. He then takes a chance and asks the others for a re-vote in which he abstains. If the other 11 jurors still vote guilty, he's willing to take the verdict into the court.A brilliantly acted one-scene film about the possibly dynamic of a jury room. Many real-life juries have taken many hours, sometimes days to reach verdicts. Other verdicts have been rendered in seemingly short periods of time. Each actor ""owns"" his character and as the discussion continues, the prejudices and irrationalities of the characters gradually reveal themselves. Interestingly, we have the notion that juries should be objective in their verdicts, but ""12 Angry Men"" poses the question: do verdicts reflect personal prejudices as much or in some cases more than simply reviewing and determining objective facts?",12 Angry Men
132,hall895,Wonderful simplicity,8,5 December 2008,"Twelve men sit around a table and talk for an hour and a half. There's your movie. Doesn't sound like much now does it? But 12 Angry Men turns out to be an exercise in wonderful simplicity. It is refreshing to know that in order to make a great movie you do not need a huge budget. No special effects are necessary. Wonderfully vibrant locations can be done without. In some cases all you need to make a great movie is a great story performed by great actors. And in 12 Angry Men that is what you get.12 Angry Men presents an exceedingly simple yet undeniably powerful story. We follow the jury deliberations in the New York City trial of a young man, a boy really, who is accused of killing his father. There is a very brief introductory scene in the courtroom as the judge presents the jury with its instructions. Apart from that scene and another very brief moment outdoors at the very end the entire film takes place within the confines of the jury room. And what goes on inside that room will fascinate. What seems to be, as one juror points out immediately, an open and shut case turns out to be much more complex. We will get to know each of the twelve members of this jury, men who come to this room from all different types of backgrounds, each with his own unique perspective. Some of the twelve will end up playing a bigger role than others but each man certainly plays his part in what unfolds.Initially eleven of the jurors vote to find the defendant guilty. There is only one holdout, Juror #8, played by Henry Fonda. Fonda's character may not be convinced of the boy's innocence but he feels the defendant is at least owed a fair deliberation to determine if there could in fact be reasonable doubt. And off the movie goes, with Juror #8 seeking to convince his fellow jurors that maybe this is not such an open and shut case after all. Suffice to say it will be quite difficult to get some of those in the room to change their mind. There are dramatic twists and turns along the way and in their interactions we learn a lot about each of these twelve men who bring their own prejudices and emotions to the proceedings. A few of the jurors stand out, most notably numbers 3 and 10 who are most adamant about the boy's guilt. Played by Lee J. Cobb and Ed Begley respectively this pair threaten to overwhelm the proceedings at times with their explosive outbursts. The contrast between this pair's rantings and the calm, rational, reasoned arguments presented by Fonda's character are quite clear. Without a doubt Fonda is the star of the film but it is the opportunity he gets to play off of the other characters which really makes the film. Without the contributions of Cobb and Begley the whole thing would be rather mundane. And the other nine actors are not to be forgotten either. Each of the jurors is completely unique and every performer in the cast does a terrific job in breathing life into their character.When a movie consists almost entirely of a group of men sitting around talking there are certain to be a few lulls and sure enough this film has a few. But once the deliberations really hit their stride and the arguments are flying back and forth the film never fails to fascinate. It's an incredibly simple movie. In this case simplicity works wonderfully. Great performances, from Fonda of course but from each of the other eleven actors as well, make this simple story real edge of the seat stuff. What goes on inside the confines of that jury room is truly memorable. It's a wonderful film and a wonderful look inside the American justice system, serving as a reminder that even the most seemingly open and shut case may not be so clear cut after all.",12 Angry Men
133,johno-21,Middle aged angst,9,13 April 2006,"12 jurors decide the fate of an 18 year old accused of murder who faces the chair. As the title implies there is tension and anger aplenty in the jurors room as the all-male cast goes at it including Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Warden, Ed Begley and Jack Klugman. A great cast and great script directed by Sydney Lumet in his first film. Lumet would go on to have a string of hit films in the 60's and 70's including The Pawn Broker, Fail Safe, Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon and Network but has been fairly inconsistent since. Lumet certainly knows how to get the best of his cast when he has great actors to work with and 12 Angry Men must have required some strenuous rehearsals. A remarkable screenplay from television writer Reginald Rose who had originally written this for television in 1954. Like the film Marty that had also been a 1953 teleplay that was adapted to the big screen in 1955 by it's writer Paddy Chayefsky, Rose does the film screenplay based on his television teleplay. This was only the second film that Rose wrote a screenplay for and he would only do a handful of movie screenplays in his career which was mostly television work. Polish-born cinematographer Boris Kaufman who was a veteran of Russian, French, Canadian and American films does the photography here. It was nominated for three Academy Awards including including major awards in Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay but amazingly no nominations for any of the ensemble cast. Fonda, did win a Bafta and Jussi Award for Best Actor and was nominated for a Golden Globe and Cobb also got a Golden Globe nomination as supporting actor but the large cast must have canceled each other out when it came to nominations for the Oscars and all the other various industry awards. Passionate, gripping, intense, compelling drama. It's obviously dated with it's all-white, all-male jury and may be a little too heavily centered on the jury room with not much room for anything else but it's great character development and holds up well.

It is not a bad movie mind you, but tied with Schindler's List, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, and Pulp Fiction as the fifth best movie ever? Yeah maybe I am missing something here.12 Angry Men takes place during jury deliberations in a death penalty case involving a young man accused of stabbing his father to death with a switchblade. Eleven jurors are ready to vote guilty, but one standout juror feels that they should take another look at the evidence. One by one, his examination of both the evidence as well as the other jurors' prejudices turns the overall vote from guilty to not guilty. The movie is shot basically on one set and gives the impression of being shot in real time. The cast is uniformly excellent. Still like any good juror, I have questions.
Is the defendant supposed to be Puerto Rican? We only barely get a look at the defendant and he seems ethnic but white. Could be Arab, Italian, Puerto Rican, etc.? Much is made that the kid is a slum dweller but juror #5 was also a slum dweller and he is played by Russian Jew Jack Klugman so that's no help. Normally, none of this would matter, but a big dramatic turning point is Juror #10 (Ed Begley) ranting and raving about how ""You know how these people lie. It's born in them. They don't know what the truth is. And let me tell you, they don't need any real big reason to kill someone, either."" with no one explaining who ""those people"" are supposed to be. French Canadians? Irish Travellers? What?The actor that portrayed the defendant (John Savoca) is Sicilian and the speech above certainly fits a stereotype for Sicilians as least as well as it would for a Puerto Rican. Most modern viewers think the defendant is Puerto Rican because of the contemporaneous musical West Side Story with world famous Puerto Rican Natalie Wood.Is the kid guilty? I will go with a solid yes. The movie in all fairness is about reasonable doubt not absolute guilt or innocence. The evidence, however, is pretty clear cut. Juror 8's admonishment that they shouldn't just give a verdict in five minutes is reasonable, (You ought to at least make it look good) but his theory that there is a reasonable doubt doesn't hold water. The switchblade used in the murder was identical to the one owned by the kid. The kid is the only other person who had access to the apartment. The kid was the only person with a motive to kill the father (He was abusive). All the crippled or blind eyewitnesses in the world really don't change these basic facts.Is Juror #8 the Devil? You know you might be onto something there. Or at the very least, since this is a film from the late fifties, he could represent a fifth columnist undermining American institutions and allowing murderers to continue to walk our streets. I am not the only one to have this notion. Some later productions of the play portray Juror #8 not as a noble crusader but as a Manipulative who's trying to get a murderer set free basically just to see if he can. Henry Fonda's portrayal in the movie borders that of a sociopath. It is almost a parody of the do-gooder liberal taken to the extreme. One of those types that looks down on his fellow man and sees it as his responsibility to lift them up to his higher plane. Notice how Fonda's character has an impeccable white suit throughout the proceedings while the others, often working class, seem disheveled and dark.How did Juror #8 get a second switchblade? He walked the neighborhood where the crime took place and bought one. While he was a juror on this case. Then he brought the switchblade into the juror room. So let's break this down. Do you want to get thrown off a jury? Conducting your own investigation is a quick and easy way to get thrown off a jury. Heck, you might even catch a misconduct charge. That's a class A misdemeanor. Now that would be the least of Jury 8's worries. It was illegal to posses for any reason (no matter how noble your intentions) a switchblade knife in New York in 1957. Heck, it is still illegal to posses a switchblade knife in New York City in 2019 and it will catch you a Class A Misdemeanor with minimum jail time sentencing guidelines. Bring that same switchblade knife concealed into a courthouse? Yup, you have now won a class E felony. Twelve Angry Men gets a sequel.Yikes is there anything you liked in the movie?: I liked the film overall. I really did. As I stated above it has good acting across the board with an incredible cast. Along with those I have already mentioned you have such greats as Martin Balsam, E. G. Marshall, Jack Warden, and John Fiedler. The pacing of 12 Angry Men is excellent and the use of one set is well done. (They made the set smaller as time went on to increase the tension.) As a bonus if you are ever asked what is the best remake of a made for TV movie here is your answer right here (12 Angry Men is a remake of a 1954 teleplay for CBS' Studio One anthology series).Any other random complaints?: Well, the title is a lie. Only Jurors 3,5,7,and 10 ever really get angry. The other real problem is that no one, on either side of the verdict seems to bring up a motive. The kid had all the motive and opportunity in the world to stab his father. The problem is that no one else really had either. No one else besides the kid had access to the apartment and no one else besides the kid had a motive to want to see the old man dead. I know I am beating a dead horse here, but why is this never really discussed? More to the point, why is this never used as a proper rebuttal to Juror #8's non sequiturs?
The entire enterprise seems to have a stacked deck from the beginning with everyone playing (and sometimes overplaying) their roles. It really reminds me of an old Twilight Zone episode with the easily wrapped up Aesop and gotcha moments manipulating the audience to the author's conclusion. The fact is takes place in one room, is in black in white, and with a group of mostly character actors also contributes to the Twilight Zone vibe. A superb Twilight Zone episode mind you but a Twilight Zone episode nevertheless. Not the fifth greatest movie of all time.",12 Angry Men
138,The_Movie_Cat,Exceptional,8,5 October 2000,"WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MILD SPOILERSThe notion of a ninety-five minute movie featuring twelve middle-aged men in real-time, almost exclusively on a single set, isn't one that sounds promising. Yet 12 Angry Men does exactly that, and works as a masterclass in film drama.There are some nice subliminal moments, such as Rudy Bond as the bored judge, obviously resigned to what seems a cut and dried case. Dialogue and characterisation is well noted, despite occasional leaning in the latter stages towards platitudes (""Wherever you run into it, blind prejudice always obscures the truth"" says Fonda commendably, but embarrassingly). Direction is where the film truly excels, though, with Sidney Lumet's camera waltzing constantly around the set, though never so that it's showy. A nice trick that I wasn't aware of was his gradual moving in of the set walls as the film goes on.For notable moments, it's interesting that the ""good"" juror from step one, Henry Fonda, leaves the room wearing a white coat, and passes the dark coat to the ""bad"" juror, played by Lee J. Cobb. I'm not suggesting this was a religious reference, but it is nicely symbolic. Also interesting is the step count Fonda does when he assumes the role of the elderly witness. While it's timed at ""41 seconds exactly"", in actual fact it all takes place 10 seconds quicker.There are perhaps times when character flaws are presented too readily, or too obviously, and the ""vote count"" is increased with unnecessary regularity, dissipating the tension somewhat. As the film moves on, Fonda's inevitable moral victory becomes more obvious, though this is a minor flaw and detracts little. The sweat, then the rain, and the excellent black and white cinematography all go towards making this a very special achievement. A mainstream film, though not a dumb one, cruelly overlooked by the Academy, who nominated it three times, but failed to give it a single Oscar.Versions of the film that wouldn't have worked:TWO ANGRY MEN: Henry Fonda tries to convince one other man that the kid is innocent. Only lasts ten minutes.TWELVE MODERATELY ANGRY, BUT NOT ESPECIALLY HEATED MEN: Twelve blokes sit around and calmly discuss the issues, while being polite and getting to know their feminine sides.THE TWIST ENDING: Henry Fonda turns round and says ""I was only kidding, I think he's guilty as Hell really - let him fry!""
Twelve Angry Men is a textbook example of good filmmaking, and an exceptionally good movie. 8/10.",12 Angry Men
139,krorie,"Twelve great actors, one superlative director, one gifted cinematographer, one hell of a movie!",10,27 January 2006,"So much has already been said about this magnificent movie by IMDb reviewers but I would like to make one other plaudit, the creative synchronization of camera, script, and music that intensifies the drama almost to the breaking point. The outstanding acting by a handpicked cast has already been noted. Not one of the twelve gave a mediocre performance. It would be hard to say which one was best. Even the ones with the fewest lines shine as few Thespians can on the big screen.Oscar-winning cinematographer Boris Kaufman focuses in on the heart of what director Sidney Lumet and writer Reginald Rose are attempting to convey to the audience through the brilliant acting of all concerned. Watch as the jurors vote to make it six to six. The camera hones in for just the right lighting, facial expression, and angle to show the anguish and torment in the souls of these twelve angry men. It flashes to the key juror #8 (Henry Fonda) from time to time at just the right moment for the full effect of his deep conviction that the eighteen year old should have a fair consideration of all the evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he is guilty of killing his father. The use of shade and shadow, especially when the thunder storm crackles outside is used to show the tempest that rages inside the jury room. The heat that eventually makes even juror #4 (E.G. Marshall) sweat complements the heat of the arguments and debates that sizzle throughout the room.All this is simultaneous with a musical score by Kenyon Hopkins that matches mood to action in a perfect blend of all essential elements making this one of the best Hollywood films ever.",12 Angry Men
140,gab-14712,One of Cinema's Best Courtroom Dramas!,9,12 December 2015,"12 Angry Men is one of best courtroom dramas in the history of cinema. Even though it is an older film, it is also a refreshing take on courtroom dramas. On the surface, this film is a pure drama about the courtroom, but it goes much, much deeper than that. I was discussing in an earlier review (Dial M for Murder) about the use of a single location. Well, this film inhabits that single location very much so, and the film is actually famous for that. Outside of three minutes, the film takes place in a single New York City courtroom. That works very well in this film takes to the expert directing by first-time director Sidney Lumet and veteran cinematographer Boris Kaufman. The film is expertly shot and the use of the focal length's shots allow the audience to feel more of each character's feelings. Lumet later discussed how a ""lens plot"" occurred to him. As the movie progressed, he changed the lenses to longer focal lengths, in order for the background to gradually close in on the characters. A very good technique I must point out.Another thing that made this film an interesting addition to the courtroom dramas is we don't know much about the case, only through secondhand evidence do we piece together what is going on. All we know is that a Spanish-American boy is accused of murdering his father. Other than a very bored-looking judge who assumes he knows the outcome of the case, we learn the case through the eyes of twelve jurors. In most courtroom movies, it's clear they like to come to a final verdict. This movie is very different because we don't know whether the boy is guilty or not, although we can assume based off the events of the movie. The movie is all about reasonable evidence, a very important study in criminal justice. Through the evidence depicted in the case, did the boy commit the murder or not? In the first few minutes in the jury room, it's clear that the majority of the jurors believe he is guilty. However, there must be an unanimous vote before they can issue their decision. The problem is that one juror, Juror #8 believes the boy is not guilty. This is where all the fun begins. The film is based on emotion, logic, and even prejudice to describe what is going on. This particular juror does not sway from his opinion, even though the other jurors are growing more angry, more restless. But as Juror #8 (Henry Fonda) describes why he believes the boy is not guilty, and he presents an admirable case why, people begin to agree with #8. There are a few arrogant jurors who refuse to move their votes for their own reasons. For example, Juror #10 (Ed Begley) is an extreme racist, as seen in a massive prejudiced rant in which the reaction of the other jurors proved to be one of the most powerful scenes of the movie. Then there is Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb), who is just a very angry man in general and he gradually becomes angrier as more people side with #8. Then there is Juror #4 (E.G Marshall), a man with wire-rimmed glasses who tries to avoid emotion in this thinking with only the use of logic. I think it was a wise movie not to give the character names. It makes each character much more powerful. I could actually remember the juror by their numbers, That's a testament for how great and unique each character is.In the 95 minutes the film runs, we become invested in each character very much so. Whether he is a racist bigot or whether he is a man who simply believes in what is right, we truly sympathize with them all. That is what you can attribute to a wonderful cast. It's interesting, because there was only one bankable star here (at the time), and that was Henry Fonda who played Juror #8 very well. He presented his case as believable as he can be. The rest of the cast were some of the best actors of New York City at the time, such as Lee J. Cobb, Martin Balsam, Jack Warden, Ed Begley, Joseph Sweeney, Jack Klugman, E.G Marshall, John Fiedler, Edward Binns, Robert Webber, and George Voskovec. They all perform very well in their roles. They need to be angry, and they certainly did get angry.Sidney Lumet is one of the best and influential American directors of all time. This was is first feature film, and he knocks it out of the park from the very first scene. In each film he does, he always has something to say-usually something controversial. Not so much in this film, but in subsequent films. He does talk about how emotions can cloud the thinking of people, and cause them to think and act irrationally. As some of the conversations and rants in this film will point out.12 Angry Men, based off a television play, ended up being one of the greatest courtroom dramas ever made. It came out at a time where lavish productions were aplenty. Despite the critical acclaim of this film, the movie actually wasn't a box-office hit when it originally opened. But enough people have seen this over the years and to see how great this film is. It spends 92 minutes in a room filled with a table and twelve men, and somehow we get incredibly tense moments that added up to be a very powerful, influential film.My Grade: A",12 Angry Men
141,SmileysWorld,Not everything is what it seems.,9,4 November 2010,"I love this film.I love it because it teaches us the lesson about how when someone's fate is in your hands,it's important to examine things from every angle.We as a society have a tendency to want to see people hang just because they fit our own personal idea of what a bad person is.If something bad happens and they happen to be nearby,we tend to make assumptions that this person participated just because of the stereotype we hang on them.Henry Fonda leads an excellent cast here in a film where dialog rules and you can cut the tension with a knife.Especially enjoyable was Lee J. Cobb's very dramatic monologue toward the film's end.A definite keeper.",12 Angry Men
142,Angry_Arguer,And the verdict is...,10,7 August 2004,"Sidney Lumet sits on my list of underrated directors alongside (among others) Joe Johnston and Brian DePalma.  Their talents have either been abused or misunderstood, but this is not such a case.Spoiler minefield ahead...Courtroom dramas aren't interesting genres.  Despite whatever plot twists are thrown there is always the 50/50 chance on verdict.  In that case, this is probably the most advanced in its class.So here we have Henry Fonda as the lowly juror disputing all the facts. Everyone is convinced.  Court adjourned.  This is your typical Grisham novel or TV drama.What changes it is how we are presented this information.  At this point in time, audiences were still trying to separate the ""fourth wall"" of stage from the fluidity of the cinema.  'Streetcar' was noble, this is professional.Now just think.  If DePalma had done this today we would've probably entered the heads of each man and had an examination of the evidence in their imagination ala 'Mission Impossible'.  We would probably also have a detached camera from the proceedings (hence ""impersonal"").Lumet obviously killed himself trying to make us latch onto the characters and think for ourselves.  This is one of few examples where the method actually works: making faces cinematic without resorting to montage.Reiner didn't learn this lesson, Parker went the other way.  Spike Lee used the heat inciter for 'Right Thing'.Final Analysis = = Learn from this.",12 Angry Men

144,DukeEman,Is this the perfect low budget cinema for students to learn from?,9,7 February 2008,"Yes, this is a Hollywood masterpiece. It was the start of an incredible journey by the director, Sidney Lumet. It's a shame the writer Reginald Rose did not have as an illustrious career as Lumet, but he did write one other classic, MAN OF THE WEST (1958). The nod goes to the performances by an amazing cast who hold it together in the confine spaces of the one setting. You would expect a film that mostly takes place in the one room to be theatrical, but Lumet manages to create the intensity with his tight direction and the brilliant use of deep focus and wide angle lenses. This is one film that all students should watch to observe the craft of how to create a very low budget movie with a perfect cast, the right director and a top notch writer.",12 Angry Men

Every face, every expression, every twitch, and is just ingenious.The acting is also amazing. Cobb and Fonda are particularly good as the two ends of the jury's decision whether a man is innocent or guilty of murder. This is an absolutely brilliant film that no one should miss. 10/10No MPAA rating and contains no objectionable (albeit complex) material",12 Angry Men
146,FilmOtaku,Effective and gripping,9,23 May 2005,"It takes a particularly effective film to remain compelling even when one has seen the film multiple times, or at the very least, knows the outcome of the story. Sidney Lumet's 1957 film ""12 Angry Men"" fits this definition to a tee in that I have seen this movie literally dozens of times over the last twenty years of my life and yet, when I watched it again last night, I found myself in the same state of tension and awe as I did the first time I saw the film.The story is simple; 12 men are thrown together because they sit on the jury for a trial that involves an 18 year old boy from the slums of New York who is accused of murdering his father, who had beaten him all of his life. The boy pleads not guilty, but because of two eyewitnesses, the jury convenes to the deliberation room strongly convinced of his guilt; except for one man, played by Henry Fonda. At first, he is ridiculed for his stance, until he slowly is able to convince some of the others that perhaps there are some aspects of the case that cast some doubt on the certainty with which they all began. Because, like most juries, there are many differences in background, social standing, etc. among them, tensions rise to a crescendo many times throughout the film, causing some of them to look introspectively at themselves and each other in order to truly deliberate the fate of this young man.The brilliance of ""12 Angry Men"" can be explained in three parts. First time director Sidney Lumet, at the time a television director, simply does everything right in this film. The setting is simple; most of the action takes place in the jury room, with the exception of some establishing shots telling the viewer where they are, and the plot is pretty straightforward. It is something that happens daily, multiple times, all across the United States. But there are some wonderful elements that he introduces into the scene to further the claustrophobia and tension: He makes it the hottest day of the summer, and for most of the film, the fan doesn't work, so you can literally see the sweat pouring off of these men and soaking through their shirts. He also uses some tight close-ups of the actors at times, particularly when they are giving dissenting opinions or are in a state of emotional discomfort.Secondly, the film's script is absolutely first-rate. Not only does the story come together like a thousand (very small) puzzle pieces, but also the clever way it does this never fails to astonish me. One would think that sitting and watching 12 guys talk about a court case while getting in each other's faces for an hour and a half wouldn't be compelling, but the intricacies of each juror, the way each of their backgrounds and prejudices are revealed is fantastic. There is nothing corny in the script, no placating moments where someone just suddenly ""sees the light""  every time one of the jurors changes his vote, it is because there have been solid questions, answers, etc. have been revealed. In other words, no one gets from point A to point B without sufficient effort.Finally, ""12 Angry Men"" features what is probably one of the greatest casts ever assembled. Henry Fonda, who usually plays a pretty good guy (with a few exceptions) plays a quiet hero in this film. He doesn't preach, he just simply is the only man in the beginning to say ""I don't know."" His obvious relief nearly every time another juror is swayed is conveyed with a simple look that clearly shows admiration for said juror. The antithesis of Fonda's character is Lee J. Cobb's juror. He is a loud, crass man who refuses to even consider that the defendant may be innocent, even when he is faced with facts and being in the position of the minority. I merely single those two out because they are probably the most central, but every single actor in the film did a brilliant job, and really managed to give their roles depth and character, something that is not easy when you're sharing screen time with 11 other great actors.There is really absolutely nothing bad to say about the film ""12 Angry Men"", a film that has been praised by critics and the public alike. It holds a very high place on the IMDb Top 250 list (I believe it was #20 the last time I looked), which is extremely encouraging to me. When the movie going public is rating films like the Lord of the Rings trilogy over films like ""Seven Samurai"" and ""Citizen Kane"", it is great to see that a ""small"" movie like this is met with such esteem and recognition. ""12 Angry Men"" definitely holds a place on my short list of ""Films I Think Everyone Should See"" because I think it really teaches the audience something about first impressions and the concept of justice, not from a lawmakers standpoint, but from the perspective of public in general. 9/10 --Shelly",12 Angry Men

We all have prejudices that we must try to put away when making a decision like these men have to make. Why not try to apply this decision making system in our daily life. Maybe then, we would live in a better world.You can feel the tension in that room. First of all, almost all of the action is in the jury room.

153,elvircorhodzic,"""According to the testimony, the boy looks guilty... MAYBE he is.""",9,8 January 2017,"12 ANGRY MEN is a courtroom drama. The power of human emotions, convincing and tense dialogues and almost perfect characterization are the biggest advantages of this film. The entire film takes place in a jury room. It is the hottest day of the year. The boy is accused for killing his own father. Jurors casually, cracking jokes, enter the hot and stuffy room. The case is crystal clear. The capital punishment is the only logical option. However, juror number 8 does not think so...I think that the most important detail in the film is face of the defendant. The boy is distraught, desperate and scared. Viewers are confronted with the terrifying truth in the next moment. The life of a boy was placed in the hands of passionate people who are prejudiced.The story is honest. I think the point is not to prove innocence or guilt in this movie. The theme of this film is the jury. Jurors are people. People of different profiles, personal problems and strange initiatives.Juror number 8 (Henry Fonda) is calm and rational man who wants to examine every possible ""reasonable suspicion"" before a final decision. He is not the voice of reason. He is a man who does not want someone's death on his hands, if there is still room for a review of the evidence.Juror number 3 (Lee J. Cobb) is probably the most complex character in this film. A businessman who hardly hides his passion and partiality. I can not describe his character as a negative. He is a man who is lost in his own drama.Juror number 4 (E.G. Marshall) is a man full of self-confidence and arrogance. The insensitivity is visible in his character. The logic and intelligence are his advantages.Juror number 7 (Jack Warden) is a man who does not have an opinion on this case. Baseball, heat and ventilator, that does not work, are more important than the boy's life. It is important to be part of the majority.Juror number 9 (Joseph Sweeney) is a wise old man who has a lot of life experience and a keen sense for perception on seemingly trivial things.Juror number 11 (George Voskovec) is careful and methodical man. He is ready to consider and accept everyone's opinion. Juror number 12 (Robert Webber) was a young businessman who has probably formed an opinion on the case, but he is afraid to publicly express it, because his intelligence could become questionable.Juror number 2 (John Fiedler) is an eloquent accountant, but apparently not loud enough.Juror number 5 (Jack Klugman) comes from the same environment as the accused boy. There is a reasonable possibility that he had a similar experience in his youth. He approaches the case on an ironic way, but quickly recognized his mistake.Juror number 1 (Martin Balsam) is an athlete, who heads the jury, although he did not realize the complexity of the situations in which they find themselves.Juror number 6 (Edward Binns) is a house painter. He is a simple man who respects his associates. However, he has a very strong sense of justice that he wants to see in this case.Juror number 10 (Ed Begley) is a real loudmouth who is eager to impose his views to others. This attitude awakened extremely ill intent in one man.All the actors were up to the task. Mr. Fonda is the central figure, but all the other characters are getting their 5 minutes.Body language, sharp dialogue and hot atmosphere are the initiators of the enormous tension in this film. I do not think that this film is a masterpiece of realism. Mr. Lumet showed emotions, prejudices and feelings through the conflict of opinions in a raw and a somewhat realistic way. Despite the scorching heat, sweating, nervousness, yelling, scheming and frustrations angry people arguing in a small room. They discuss the life of a young person. However, I am pleased with the sincere dialogue, tense atmosphere and provocative drama.",12 Angry Men
154,barryrd,Anger among the jury results in justice,8,16 January 2011,"This classic movie has an excellent cast of well-known actors in a story that goes to the heart of the justice system. From the beginning, it is apparent that the young man on trial for a murder is saddled with a jury that is totally unfit to pass judgement on whether he should live or die. Very few of these men should have passed a jury selection process; they were impulsive, lacking in compassion, ignorant of the law, and highly prejudiced against anyone not like themselves,except for two or three. This wedge enabled Henry Fonda, the lone dissenting voice at the start, to make a series of points that eventually blew away the arguments that the young man was guilty. During the process of passing judgement, the jury is subject to an intense self-examination of their own prejudices and opinions.As the movie goes along, the viewer is appalled at the mentality of the group, with no understanding of the scope of their responsibility. The foreman, Martin Balsam, takes his job very routinely and would have easily allowed the jury to pass judgement without any reflection. The movie was very effective in showing the men sweat and fly off the handle in the midst of a New York heatwave that made them eager to get away from the courtroom. At one point, one of the last holdouts, E.G. Marshall, playing an unemotional and stone-faced juror, was forced to wipe his brow under a barrage of questioning from Henry Fonda that exposed the falsehood of his assumptions. We see similar cutaways to Lee J. Cobb, who eventually loses his grip as others take the opposite side in the argument.This is a tense and unvarnished look at human beings thrown together in a jury and it shows the forces at play that would deny that justice be done. I am sure that this movie and others gave rise to some of the changes to the American justice system over the last 60 years to prevent the miscarriages of justice that probably occurred in many cases. A great movie and a lesson in the due process of law.",12 Angry Men
155,esteban1747,"Henry, you are right, it's magnificent",9,15 May 2005,"There's no adjective to qualify this extraordinary all-times classic, which demonstrated that there is no need to spend heavy sum of money to make an useful film. The life of a young man likely to be innocent is an enormous responsibility for any jury in the world, and the plot goes around this issue. People in the jury do not necessarily think in the same way, some may favor what the supposed evidences showed in the process, others do not think too much and go behind the wave of the opinion of the majority, while others may be going deeper into this matter and not accepting all testimonies as good evidences. Furthermore, majority always tries to convince that minority who really analyzes each evidence and its truth. That's what we can see in ""12 Angry Men"", which was filmed in a room with the participation of only 16 actors, some of them playing outstandingly like Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, Jack Warden and Martin Balsam among others. It is a paradox to note that such an excellent material only got Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for best director (Sidney Lumet) and actors (Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb). However, outside US the film got all the merits it deserves, as BAFTA in UK, Bodil in Denmark, Golden Bear in Berlin Festival, Blue Ribbon in Tokyo, and Silver Ribbon in Italy.",12 Angry Men
156,ofpsmith,My all time favorite movie.,10,6 October 2013,This film is without any flaws. It's the closest to absolute cinematic perfection I've ever been privileged enough to see. I'm a 13 year old kid and last year when I was in 7th grade civics class my teacher brought this in when we were talking about court cases. I was excited because I'm a big Henry Fonda fan! When I first watched it I loved it but it wasn't my favorite film. Then after I watched it 4 more times I gradually loved it more and more! It then became my favorite film. So this is the plot. 12 jurors are deciding the guilt or innocence of an 18 year old boy accused of stabbing his father with a knife. On the surface the kid looks guilty but juror #8 (Fonda) wants to discuss all witnesses accounts given in court. Eventually he decides that the kid is innocent and eventually so does everyone else. It's interesting to listen to even the smallest details become the most important facts of the whole case. I highly recommend this movie to everyone. Every frame of the film is golden. Whoever did the casting is smarter than a scientist. It's so good it looks like I've completely run out of complements to say about it. Watch this movie. It's so amazing it makes everything else seem low. If you ever come across a chance to watch this movie by all means take it!,12 Angry Men
157,artzau,EXCELLENT...no other word for it,10,14 October 2001,"I rarely give a film a '10.'  But, this film with absolutely no weak spots deserved it.  Everything works.  All of the actors are great.  The film has a darkness to it, a quiet gray sense of hopelessness, as boring as a New York summer day, hot, humid and dark.  The weariness fades as the various members of the jury reveal bits and pieces of themselves as the plot unfolds and the wave of change sparked by new awareness begins to sweep the dreary juryroom.  The jurymen begin to lose their apathy, antipathy and conflicted, convoluted attitudes.  As the action goes on, each man must confront himself, his own values and his own fears, prejudices and weaknesses.  The ending is a triumph for all of us.  Reginald Rose not only put together a flawless thriller but look at that cast.  Not a cull in the bunch.  Several went on to establish themselves as character actors, e.g., John Fiedler, Robert Webber, Edward Binns, George Voscovec and Joseph Sweeney.  Some others were already stars in their own right, Ed Begly Jr., Lee J. Cobb, Henry Fonda and others, Jack Klugman, Jack Warden, E.G. Marshall and Martin Balsam went on to achieve stardom in films and TV.  All were veteran character actors who add a ring of credulity to their roles.

158,oneloveall,The jury has reached a verdict,9,3 May 2007,"This near perfect, post-courtroom exploration of the twelve jurors who were to decide one boy's fate is every bit deserving as accolades would suggest. A shot to my dying cinematic heart, this film's staggering focus took an involving legal story and brilliantly merged it with a complex and diverse character study, making 12 Angry Men one the most engaging ensemble works of American history. Packed almost entirely into one plain meeting room for deliberation, the simmering screenplay should keep anyone glued to their screen into the very last frame; tension like this is simply unavailable these days. Equally effective as a plot-deducing mystery and gripping morality play, the genius behind this legendary feature lies in a seamless combination of those two particularly strong traits.Delivering the film's highest ideals from page is an absolutely flawless group of men who are highly synergistic on top of their incredible individual takes. Though Henry Fonda will be remembered as the central character, the level of professionalism coming from the remaining 11 demands complete attention. Therefore singling anyone out would be a lost cause, except for studying the intricacies of any of the individually sublime roles. Some have characterizations that dwarf others, many take up less screen time then a few key players, but all in all the respect and generosity given to manifest each different personality is astounding and echoes the most transcendent aspects of dramatic form as we watch the mesmerizing layers of human consciousness become peeled away.Essentially it is that timeless and eloquent capturing of a man's mind on the brink of justice that will keep 12 Angry Men forever fresh in our hearts. A historical directing debut for Sidney Lumet proved that his years working in television were not in vain. Exquisitley shot, even many technical setbacks will do nothing to distract from this commanding work. From start to finish, the film is testament to singular creative glory, only slightly betrayed by an overplayed cathartic climax.",12 Angry Men
159,Movi3DO,Simply The Best,10,5 May 2021,"Oh man how the turntables. This took ""Reasonable Doubt"" to another whole level.Well for a cinephile this is one of absolute classic. So I wanted to check it out and see if the hype was real. Not only was I surprised that listening to 12 people in a room can be so fascinating, I also was astounded at how emotionally invested I was.When the 12 jurors got into the room, the atmosphere was pretty friendly, and I liked the one long shot of just the 12 men talking and greeting each other. However, the moment they sat down, my eyes were glued to the screen the whole time.What was so intriguing about the movie was that, when the men tried to re-examine the evidence and testimony, there was a struggle of the men not trying to argue and get personal. This brought the point about the realism of this movie. This had to be one of the best screenplays. The dialogues and camera angles were incredibly real and hooking.As the movie got along, I became emotional, and felt like I was the 13th person in the room listening. The reactions from the men were incredibly relatable. I understood why each of these characters would feel the way they did. This made the scenes even more interesting because I felt like I would react just like any one of these men. Also, when a new point was brought up, I both felt amazed and ridiculed, just like how these men felt.Not only was I emotionally invested, I also was shocked at the arguments. People were firing and shouting at each other. Some of the counter arguments had me jumped up because of how good and satisfying they were. There were many ""Got 'em"" moments.Overall, an absolute masterpiece. I got drama, thriller, suspense, and shock values just from listening to 12 angry men stuck in a room during a hot evening. No flaws. 10/10.",12 Angry Men
160,JohnRayPeterson,"An authentic classic has audiences captivated, be it 1957 or 2012; this one does",9,10 December 2011,"Most of the young middle age viewers of today would not remember the named actors in this ensemble cast except a few. I remember them well and I know I'm not alone. Most all of them have had superb careers and were leading men. The name that transcends them all is of course Henry Fonda; the coolest and most deliberate role was his and he owned it. I think of all the others as co-stars and not supporting actors. Lest we forget the directing by a master, Sidney Lumet, and camera crew as well as the grips who had to allow the story to flow without interfering; splendid work. I don't agree with some reviewers who state this sort of drama in one room is not and could not be done anymore; it was done magnificently in the 2010 movie ""The Sunset Limited"" with Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson; however that was only two men going back and forth with their arguments, and the script was worked from a successful play. I expanded on the qualities of it, in a review; the 1957 ""12 Angry Men"" is superior in a few ways. The dialogue is more difficult and requires very good direction and oddly, the one room also for stage for 'Sunset' was bigger and allowed gesturing which '12 Angry Men' were limited in such acting resource.In '12 Angry Men' Fonda makes the profound arguments for the other jurors to take their responsibilities seriously because of the stakes. The story is a brilliant piece of work in the development of characters and principals and the flow of all that should be, actually gets there in a plausible flow. The audience is captivated by each juror's journey; that's classic drama/thriller. The high ratings has been steady over time, which only means new audiences can appreciate good stuff. I was glad to view it again after so many years and I still feel I get my money's worth; I'll be watching the 1997 remake to compare and see how William Friedkin handled a remake of such a strong Classic.",12 Angry Men

164,rajdoctor,12 Angry Men,8,28 July 2007,"One of the all time classics! The story is about 12 jury members in a room for about 90 minutes (real time) to decide the open and shut case of a young boy of 18 years killing his father. There are 11 votes confirming guilty and 1 for not-guilty. The whole movie is about how the 12 votes finally reach 11 confirming non-guilty and 1 for guilty, until the last one too gives in to an anonymous verdict that the boy is not guilty of his father's murder.The movie was delicately presented. As audience we find that the case that was to be fought in the court-room was fought among the jurors. Each and every juror was aware of all the facts of the case and everyone was on the same page, except one  Juror no. 8 (Henry Ford). The movie explores the value of one life on looking minutely at the known events and unfolding them in better light for audience to understand and know that what seems truth often is not  if you look closely at it.The movie is shot in a single room that is hot, humid and sweaty  and halfway through it starts raining outside. The enigma of the 12 jurors, the ding-dong dallying between guilty and not-guilty, the peeling of the case layer by layer with new discussions crossing personal experiences and relation to the case was fascinating to watch.Henry Ford acts with such anxiousness that you are bitten by his conviction of not-guilty the moment he speaks his doubts by saying  I do not know, I am not sure. That starts the mastery roller-coaster to a finale that is hard to take the eyes off.The Director Sidney Lumet does a fantastic job in I think (most probably) converting this stage drama into big screen canvass with eminent 12 actors. All of them have acted poignantly well in their well written characters and mannerisms. One can see their upbringings while they talk and that is marvelous.Wonderful movie, normally I hesitate to give movies more than 8 stars, but for this I will give (Stars 8.25 out of 10)",12 Angry Men
165,RossRivero99,Henry Fonda's greatest performance,10,17 May 2014,"Perhaps Sidney Lumet's most widely acclaimed film 12 Angry Men was a true masterpiece for a directorial debut. The movie tells the interesting story of a dissenting juror in a murder trial who slowly manages to convince others that the case isn't as obviously clear as it seemed in court. In which the Juror that tries to convince the others is played by Henry Fonda who gives the best performance of his career under Lumet's masterful direction. The other jurors are played wonderfully played by Martin Balsam, Jack Warden, Ed Begley Sr., Jack Klugman, and Lee J. Cobb (in his best performance since On the Waterfront.). In my cinematic opinion I consider this film as not only a great from Sidney Lumet but I also consider it as his best movie that he ever directed. But there was other masterpieces that he directed in his career for example The Verdict, and Network.This was a great movie that is worth watching over and over and over again.",12 Angry Men

But 12 Angry Men stands the test of time.I saw this film for a class in business school, believe it or not, as an example of communication and negotiation. Throughout the film, the main character uses various ways of building rapport, convincing people, and debate. It's really astonishing.The film does a good job of setting up personalities quickly, using generic characterizations that make it easy to follow all of the 12 characters. Unlike Runaway Jury there isn't a lot of action, but there's plenty of tension and this action film junkie found it to be accessible and very engaging.Who should see this film:-- Everyone who has an interest in classics.-- People who are curious about classics but want to avoid the boring ones.

It is a travesty that it never got an Oscar bu that is a reflection more on the Oscars than the film itself. Henry Fonda is outstanding in this as is Lee J Cobb, but really all the actors were very well cast. Don't make the mistake of confusing this with the colour remake, although good it does not match up to this original and best version. For me the best bits are the part where Jack Klugman's character produces the knife ( although this could never have happened in a real Jury it is stil dramatic ) and then there is the part where Lee J Cobb breaks down while looking at a picture of his son.

And yet they did. And how. Henry Fonda plays superbly well, as all actors, in this argumentative arm-wrestle between heart and brains, the 'heart' being the humane aspect and utter respect for others, and 'brains' being the logical, cerebral but ultimately lazy approach to problems. There is a very, very strong morality in this film, and unlike what you'd think, it is very, very subtly implied, carefully placed throughout the genes of this masterpiece, and very strongly executed. This film is pure acting where film is closest to acting on a theater stage. This film is asking philosophical questions with purpose and meaning and depth rather than fancy intellectual babbling. And it is a grande analysis of the psychology of men, on many different levels and in a plurality of examples. And never in excess, or exaggeration. Not one over-dramatic scene. Just right. Brilliant.",12 Angry Men
171,oOoBarracuda,12 Angry Men,10,3 August 2017,"I wonder what it must have been like for Sidney Lumet to direct a perfect film for his feature film debut. Lumet had worked on television shows before directing his 1957 film 12 Angry Men, a debut film examining justice and the motivation behind people's actions and the motivation behind their decisions when a group of jurors decides whether to convict a young man of a murder that would result in his being sentenced to death. First developed for a CBS Studio One anthology television series, Reginald Rose wrote 12 Angry Men and developed it into a teleplay in 1954. Lumet's version is still thought of by many as a perfect film 60 years after its release. With an all-star cast including Henry Fonda, Martin Balsam, Lee J. Cobb, and Jack Klugman among others, 12 Angry Men is my personal favorite film to watch when I want to see a collection of the best acting talent. What I wouldn't give to have been in the theatres during the first run of 12 Angry Men. I can only imagine the audience reaction to such a powerful yet understated film. Alas, I was born in the wrong time and instead of being able to head to the cinema and see 12 Angry Men, I'm here buying tickets for The Emoji Movie.A desperate teenager is seen staring longingly at the men who just heard his case exiting the jury stall. He knows they will be the ones deciding his fate. The young man is on trial for the murder of his father, and if convicted, will face the death penalty. From the outside, his case looks open and shut. He had an argument with his father that was overheard by neighbors, he owned a knife which was the same weapon used to kill his father, and he had previous grievances with the law. Most of the jurors file into their sequestered room assuming they won't be in long, as the verdict seems clear. One juror, however, has doubts and refuses to cast a vote for guilty without at least discussing the case as they've been assigned to do. Begrudgingly the jurors begin to discuss the case sure that their minds won't be changed. One by one, however. further examination of the evidence and the factors involved in the case reveal the motivations each man had used to inform their decision was less based on evidence and more so on their own biases. An exploration of the human psyche and what motivates our thought processes, 12 Angry Men has more than earned its place as one of American cinema's best.The opening credit sequence of 12 Angry Men was a divine long shot, achieved at a high-angle through a fan, that would provide a source of tension throughout the film, of each of the jurors filing into the room preparing to see to the matters of the case. After their opening vote reveals only one holdout, mob mentality takes over as a few vocal members of the majority intend on proving to Henry Fonda's juror #8 why their view on the matter is more accurate than his. In doing so, they also reveal their biases and the different factors driving their decision. Whether it's the lonely brokenness of a severed relationship or attempting to assert dominance to shield one's own powerlessness, each man is operating with far more than the facts of the case driving them. The lengths Lumet went to conceal the names of the jurors was one of the best decisions he made to drive home the universality of the film's message. At one point, a court worker asks one of the jurors his name and he points to it on the clip board held by the court worker. In a typical situation, one would have just said their name out loud, but Lumet's stroke of brilliance avoided names being used through the entire runtime of the film allowing audiences the chance to see themselves in the characters depicted on screen. Whether we are aware or not, and whether we act on them or not, we are all driven by personal biases. We learn the set of biases that drive us as we mature, first from our immediate familial surroundings, then from the people we surround ourselves with and the circumstances we endure. If those biases are negative, it is our responsibility to analyze them and see that we eradicate them. As a character study, 12 Angry Men is top- notch with no small thanks owed to the exceptional cast. Every single name on the credits list is that of a well-established actor of the time. Martin Balsam, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Ed Begley, and Henry Fonda are only half the cast and each known by an extensive body of work. One exceptional aspect, which also points to Lumet's directorial prowess he possessed even from his feature film debut is how improbable it is that this film would be such a success. One-setting films with small casts and rich in dialogue are not the easiest films to pull off, yet you'd be hard- pressed to find someone who won't give accolades to 12 Angry Men. Not once through the runtime is the film static nor does it lose the engagement of the audience. Lumet ends the film in a sensational way, as well. When Fonda helps Cobb with his coat after the two were the fiercest of adversaries during deliberations, Lumet communicated to the audience that we are all capable of seeing past what initially drives our motives and can possibly overcome them and come together on the other side. Then, just before the film ends, we learn Fonda's name and see he and another juror uncomfortably stand on the courthouse steps not knowing what to say to one another. Despite having gone through an emotional afternoon together, they don't know each other and don't have much to say to one another.",12 Angry Men

173,ronakkotian,Twelve men. One room. One masterpiece.,10,27 March 2021,"This is regarded as one of the best films ever made and I see why.12 Angry Men is about a jury of twelve men who decide whether a boy is guilty of a murder or not. Everyone finds him guilty except for Juror 8 who believes there's reasonable doubt leading the rest of the jury to question their decisions.By the end of its 96 minute runtime, I was completely blown away. For a film so limited in scale, I couldn't believe how suspenseful and incredible this film was. The majority of this film takes place in one room and it's masterful how well made it is. As the opening credits roll, Sidney Lumet tracks the camera in one single take, introducing us to every character and helping us get a first impression of what they're like. It's an outstanding beginning that establishes Lumet's talent. Lumet makes use of the one location to its full potential. The way some scenes are shot and edited make for some extremely tension filled moments that managed to surprise me in every way. There is not a single dull moment. As it progresses, the suspense goes up a notch leaving my eyes glued to the screen for its entirety. It's especially impressive considering this was Lumet's feature film debut. Could you get a better debut than this?!For a film taking place in one room, a lot of dialogue is thrown around in what I consider to be one of the best scripts to ever be written. Reginald Rose's script astounds me. Not only am I dazzled by the way Rose unfolds this case but also how much it revealed certain details about the characters. He's very smart in framing the opinions of each of the men and why they have that opinion, leading to some emotionally powerful scenes that disclose reasons as to why some members think the boy is guilty excluding the evidence presented. This is a script that writers will dream of writing and I have to praise Reginald Rose for achieving this feat. Aside from the script and direction, the performances is the icing on the cake. Every single person puts their best foot forward and delivers incredible performances. Henry Fonda stands out as Juror 8 and is extremely compelling to watch. Lee J. Cobb is another standout who gets better and better as the film continues. Bit by bit, we learn how troubled of a person he is and Cobb steals the show during those intense scenes.I now see why 12 Angry Men is loved so much. This is a film and ensemble piece that has it all. It's outstanding on every single level whether it's the performances, the script or the direction. This is a work of art that should be watched by everyone!",12 Angry Men

Let's talk about it.Well, the most important movie in terms of format and and in fact the best movie it terms of dialogue. This movie is completely unconventional in format and it's setting. 12 men discuss a case in a room, weird for a movie isn't it. How long can you sustain drama with a case, that's the point. Extremely well written and well acted, this is in fact a testimony of writing. All films have to be driven by writing more than anything else. Simply shot, the dialogue makes up for everything here. There are many things that could have been shown like it happens in other courtroom dramas, that is I mean the whole trial, the evidences, the arguments. But here, the trial is over only the judgment of the jury is pending which is 11-1 from the word go and in all expectation should have been 12-0 in favor of guilty. Now, that does not make a good character of the man who stood out. That 1 man has to influence all the 11 others to become an outstanding man from a mere standing out person. And that is what exactly happens. Good, in every which way you consider. If you see it once, and I am sure if you watched it once, you will mostly be convinced by my argument it's the most Simply made movie that is great in all aspects. Henry Fonda, must be appreciated a lot for producing this and giving the job of direction to Sidney Lumet as his first movie. Greatly written by Reginald Rose as a play and then for the movie. All the greatness pertaining to this movie should be credited to the mentioned three names. Thanks for everyone who was a part of this film and made it what it is today. This is one of the most important films of my life as it triggered a thought of why don't I make a movie set in a room and that's just live talk. Oh yes, I waited for the longest time to get a Blu ray of this, and was very happy again with the quality., blu-ray just rocks and thanks for the transformation.It's 5/5 for a movie that has stood the test of time and will be as great as ever even many years later.",12 Angry Men

Maybe in 1957 the characters in this movie seemed thick and nuanced but having seen this recently for the first time i was struck by how one dimensional each seemed. from the first few minutes of the movie you can easily decipher who's going to be a ""bad"" guy and who's going to be a bastion of choirboy-like fairness and innocence. maybe given the self contained nature of the plot there is much room for character development but perhaps something a little less like caricatures....the other thing that bothered me about the movie that pays so much attention to method of reason is the fact that early on in the movie it is stated that the knife had been wiped clean before the police got there. but according to witnesses the boy allegedly fled right a way. this seems a bit incongruent and yet no one in the movie has brought it up and no critical review of the movie seems to have brought it up. it would seem to be a major factor in the case and i can't believe it is overlooked. instead it's omission from discussion only makes the whole plot look as thin as the characters.........and upon further review each ""explanation"" or alternative given to explain away the facts in the case seems far-fetched.... but taken all together seems a full on miscarriage of justice. a nuanced director might have ended in a hung jury. NOPE. this one dimensional movie has to either be 1 or 0 or in the case of the jury all for or all against.even at a paltry ninety minutes it still greatly overstays it's welcome.

Starring Henry Fonda and some of Hollywood's finest stars at the time. screenplay by Reginald Rose who wrote probably one of the most interesting, compelling and stunning scripts ever made. one jury tries to convince his fellow jurors to reconsider the case they were given and discuss the trial and evidence. soon enough the feud and rage among the characters starts growing. the room the jurors are in slowly starts to be filled with dynamite. shot perfectly and filmed marvelously. there was one scene in particular that impressed me: the opening scene when all the jurors walk inside the room and get to know each other. the scene is shot in a form of one shot, with a few close ups during shooting. its a well establishing shot that opens the plot of the film. the dialogue is probably the best part of the movie. so many great scenes with dramatic lines and dialogue so well written, it should have won the academy award for best screenplay. overall 12 Angry Men is a absolute masterpiece and a must watch for all film buffs. people can learn a lot about dialogue and character's interactions from this film.",12 Angry Men
179,christophe92300,Very good,8,15 December 2012,"The only thing you could blame 12 Angry Men for is its predictability with this scheme that repeats itself until the final outcome, offering no surprises. The rest is top-notch and we are certainly in front of one of the best, if not THE best closed-door feature ever made, a very difficult genre as it happens.The script relies on very well written dialogues, powerful, striking, captivating throughout the movie, and well developed characters that each have their own psychology. It is played by convincing actors, Henry Fonda on top of the list.One can easily appreciate the difficult task that falls to the members of the jury and the ease with which an error is possible, even though some demonstrations are a bit far-fetched.As for the direction, it is very good considering the limited possibilities offered by the set. The shots are intense and emphasize perfectly the oppressive atmosphere and the important choice the jury has to make.",12 Angry Men
180,bgar-80932,Great acting and great dialogue,8,21 August 2019,"This is one of the rare black and white movie that stands the test of time for me. It's 12 jurors who are put in charge of the fate of a young man in a murder trial. It's not just guilty or not guilty because if they choose guilty the man gets the death penalty. This have more gravity to it and it's the main reason one juror opposes guilty at the beginning. Throughout the process they talk it out and see maybe he is guilty, maybe he isn't, but there is more reasonable doubt than there was at first glance with the trial. It's a movie all in one room and that is 62 years old so the odds were in the favor of me not enjoying it but I get why this is rated so highly and I enjoyed it. I probably won't watch it again but the acting was pretty good and it's very impressive to stand up this far down the road.",12 Angry Men

184,CinematicInceptions,"A well-made, timeless, and thought-provoking film.",8,9 May 2018,"After watching this three times for a class, I have some mixed feelings on this movie. I would like to see a version where the scenario was reversed and eleven jurors thought the defendant was clearly innocent and one thought he was guilty. It would be a much more morose debate with an even darker ending, but I would still like to see it. As I was watching it, I felt pretty confident that the kid would get out of his death sentence, but it was still interesting to watch and see how all of the jurors were convinced.The characters are all written pretty well, with even the minor ones having a lot of personality. I think I got a couple of them confused on my first viewing but for the most part they were easy to keep track of. The ones I found most interesting were numbers 4, 5, and 6, being the stockbroker, the guy from the Baltimore slum, and the painter. Juror number 8, the hero, I found to be rather hypocritical as I went back and watched it a second and third time. He says that he just wants to debate and think on the matter more, but really, I don't think he does. Any time he speaks, he's trying to bring the jury toward a verdict of ""not guilty"", he has prepared evidence for why the kid isn't guilty, and he piggy-backs off of any comment from anyone else that pushes the jury toward a not-guilty verdict. This hardly seems like an unbiased form of deliberation, and to be honest, I wouldn't be surprised if he were a lot different in the rest of his life than he is in deliberating.As a viewer, it's also very engaging to think of yourself as a juror and decide whether and when you are convinced by the evidence. Even if you can assume that the kid isn't guilty, it is still possible to think about the evidence objectively and decide when you are convinced. Most of the dialogue is very well-structured and concise in the debates, though the characters do rehash some points of the case for the audience's sake. Some of it feels forced, but it is necessary for the audience to be on the same page as the jurors so any dialogue that isn't ""fly on the wall"" is pretty excusable. But it rarely drags and keeps you interested. The characters are also diverse enough in personality (despite lacking any diversity in race or gender) to make it so that you will have a couple that you like and a couple that you don't like. Sidney Lumet definitely has a few that he wants you to root for and a couple he wants you to hate.Even though the filmmaking style and a few dialogue colloquialisms feel a bit outdated, the movie has stood the test of time. Is it the fifth best movie of all time? I would say that's going a bit far, but it is a very well-made yet simple movie. It proves that all you really need to make a classic is some good content and solid performances and little else. Those aren't always the easiest things to come by, but in a world where movies are constantly exceeding $100 million budgets, it's something we would do well to remember.

186,MattBrady099,Such a classic film.,10,22 May 2015,"The power of movie dialogue really makes this movie a true classic.The story to 12 Angry Men is one man on a jury stands alone in a case in which most are initially convinced one way but one by one may be convinced another way.12 men in one room just talking about one murder case and them sharing they opinions if the person that may have committed murder is guilty or not, now many things here could have went wrong, you got to have the best writer, the best director and the best actors to make this movie work and it payed off so well and I think this is cinema's greatest risk of doing something new with the story, giving it a twist and a edge and 12 Angry Men paid off brilliantly.The acting from every singe actor in this movie all do realistic, believable, funny and serious performance's and they all add a lot of weight and drama to their character's. I wish I can bring up every single actors name in this cast but I'm not since these 12 of them and it's going to take up the all page and I can't talk about every singe actor and go into detail about them one at a time, but I can say that everyone in the movie did a flawless work of acting that's pure Oscar worthy and the kind of drama acting they should show kids in drama school. Nicely done fellas.Sidney Lumet directed this movie and this has to be some of the best directing I've seen from this guy. He really added a lot to this movie when it came to story and characters and the back and forward they have with each other and it worked by his direction.The characters in the movie (The Twelve Angry Men) don't really like each that much as in every scene they at each other's throat trying to confidence the other men in the room that the man is guilty for murder while that person and the other's bring up some really solid points that this man is guilty or not guilty for murder. As a viewer myself I got really interested in the case and trying to think if he's guilty or not, so this movie does a fantastic job of giving the viewer a opinion on the case and see if you think he did it or not.For problems with the movie: I don't have any.Overall 12 Angry Men is such a classic movie with excellent performances from everyone, the writing outstanding and the directing was some of the best. You haven't seen 12 Angry Men then I say go see it, it's worth your time.",12 Angry Men
187,SKG-2,A couple of problems but still very good,9,15 March 1999,"First of all, I have a couple of problems with this movie which keeps this from being a classic for me.  First of all, I recognize that this is a different time than now, but I find it hard to believe that a defense lawyer would allow such obviously prejudiced jurors like the ones played by Ed Begley and Lee J. Cobb onto the jury.  Even if he was just the public defender, it seems to me he'd have some sense.  Also, again even though this was a different time, I read an article by Alan Dershowitz who points out there's no way Henry Fonda would have been able to bring a knife into the deliberation room.  Nevertheless, this is still a good film, because it really explores what reasonable doubt truly means, and it showcases some excellent acting.  Sidney Lumet also does a good job directing his first film.",12 Angry Men

191,lagudafuad,"Nice courtroom drama, a classic",7,13 October 2012,"This courtroom drama is rated second in AFI's 10 Top 10 Courtroom Drama, behind the classic To Kill A Mockingbird. Although the movie is not as great as To Kill AMockingbird, it does boast of excellent acting skills and a nice view of how the human mind works.Most of the entire movie took place in the jury room. The total time spent outside of the jury room was three minutes out of the full 96 minutes of the movie and the time in the Jury room exposes you to how judgemental the world is.This drama film was adapted from a teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose, whose screenplay for 12 Angry Men was initially produced for the CBS program Studio One in 1954.The film tells the story of a jury made up of 12 men as they deliberate the guilt or acquittal of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt that was brought up by one of the jurors. Juror 8 (Henry Fonda) was the juror that brought up the basis of reasonable doubt. He was the movie's protagonist.Juror 8 had the herculean task of proving to the others that his reasonable doubt was valid since In the United States (both then and now), a verdict in most criminal trials by jury must be unanimous.As the movie went on, you will see how some of the jurors were seeing things from the view of juror 8 and how some remained adamant.The movie's main antagonist was juror 3 a stubborn disrespectful man, who no matter what some of the others were able to prove stood his ground, by doing so he kept some of the jurors at his side of the defendant being guilty.'12 Angry Men' was remade for television in 1997. Directed by William Friedkin, the remake starred Jack Lemmon as one of the jurors. Most of the action and dialogue of the film are identical to the original. Although there was no smoking in the jury room and concentration shifted to income and pop culture.12 angry men's teleplay has been adapted to many TV series over the years some of these include Hancock's Half Hour, Picket Fences, Perfect Strangers, Family Matters, The Dead Zone, Early Edition, The Odd Couple, King of the Hill, Matlock, 7th Heaven, Veronica Mars, Monk, Hey Arnold!, Peep Show (TV series), My Wife and Kids, Robot Chicken, and The Simpsons.The movie is exceptionally captivating and you will not regret the time you spent watching this movie.www.lagsreviews.com",12 Angry Men
192,willcundallreview,A masterpiece of debate,10,5 December 2015,"12 Angry Men, a classic movie that is truly one that can be enjoyed by anyone no matter what genre of film you might prefer. The film is one of thrills but done in a way where it is all in the dialogue and the body language of the 12 men set up to decide the fate of a young man who is on trial for the murder of his father. The movie also explores the 12 men's lives and also any prejudices they hold against the young man on trial, different perspectives are had throughout the movie not just on the murder itself but also on the man's back story as a child and how his father brought him up. A masterpiece simply in the way that it entices the viewer so that your focus is never lost and draws you in as you explore the case in one room with one table and 12 chairs.It can't be easy to create something so astounding from 90 odd minutes of people sat in a room talking, but this achieves it and achieves it pretty fast too, it doesn't take long before you're drawn in yourself and want to know more. Sidney Lumet directs and does a fine job, he is the person really responsible for making this feel so damn well exciting I guess and combined with Reginald Rose's story and script it makes it so much more of a classic. Lumet gets the very best out of his actors and really pulls the strings, even little things like when the men move around the room; it makes what they are saying that little bit better.Henry Fonda as juror number 8 really leads the cast, after all his character is the one who at first wants to talk about the case and debate it when everyone else thinks the kid should fry. Fonda is absolutely brilliant in his role; his calm demeanour mixed with his impassioned speeches on the case make his character one of the true good guys of cinema. Lee J. Cobb's character stands out a lot because of his overall anger at the boy involved in the case, Juror number 3 who Cobb plays is one of the stand outs because of his behaviour during the debating being done. Each juror is different, from the angry to the very meek, the guy who wants to get out of the place for a baseball game to the guy who grew up in a slum just like the young man on trial did. They each bring not only different personalities but back stories too with some loud mouths and some quiet and really indifferent to the case and that together is another reason why this is flawless cinema.12 Angry Men deserves its place in the classics of cinema, not just for its acting or its directing etc but mostly because it's a story that all can enjoy and I think most who watch this can say they at least wanted to see how it ends. As said before it cannot be easy to create something like this, all in the same room and not make the audience bored by it all, but it has enough great things in it to make it more than just a good or great film, it's pretty much perfect. Another thing that this film does which is fantastic is you start to visualize the case at hand, I mean sure you listen to the jurors talk but sometimes it makes you start imagining all the things going on that the case entails, from the murder, the train and to the old man's story, the film never fails to bring new things up and shake the case about a little.",12 Angry Men
193,rdoyle29,The best film of it's type,10,9 September 2017,"There's some interesting alchemy going on in this film. While it's extremely realistic in it's look and attention to detail, it's a highly stylized and somewhat mechanical film. All the characters are clearly defined by the single aspect they bring to the scenario and they interact more like types than real people. The story doesn't show you what's on it's mind, it flat out tells you by putting the parts of it's thesis into the mouths of the characters. None of this really matters though because between it's exceptional cast and Lumet's masterful direction. what you get is a finely tuned machine of a film that's the best film ever made of it's kind. Fonda specialized in playing the voice of middle-class intellectual liberalism in the early 60's and it's largely because of his performance here.",12 Angry Men

Now it is a case of the lone juror to preside his view of the case to the other eleven who rushed into the idea of his total guilt.

As the story unfolds, we get to see how each juror decides guilt or innocence in a true testament to the intellectual diversity of 50s America, and indeed present day America. I can give current names to each juror from people I know personally. Made prior to Bill of Rights reforms and Miranda rights, the way people make decisions on guilt of innocence is timeless. Stereotypes, ethnic hatred, past fraternal experiences transferred onto the defendant all masterfully depict human frailties. In the end one lone voice of reason tries to Socratic-ally make the jurors look within themselves to identify the flaws in their decision making process. Innocent until proved guilty, the human condition, society in general is on trial here. This movie has a place in everyone's collection. This is real life.",12 Angry Men
196,alicecbr,It all hung on the actors' skill,10,17 June 2006,"12 men in a jury room: no women in 1957, of course. Fonda played it great, as did the screenwriter: no pressure, just let them come to their own conclusions. Put enough pressure on the bastards, so they show their asses and then the nice guys will see the light and change their verdict.Loved that they showed the equivocator and the one who wanted to get to the ball game, so he voted not guilty .....but were also shown up for what they were. The prejudiced guy making his bigoted pitch, with all the folks standing up and turning their backs: obviously, this was not Birmingham jury. When you look at the lynchers who were acquitted by all-white juries, you know that Henry Fonda couldn't have made a damn with them.When I was attacked on the Boston Red Line by a drunken thug who took my Peace sign and jammed me in the stomach with it, then ignored by the MBTA police on the platform, I knew how it must feel to be a black man in 1950s Alabama and try to get justice.When we went to Quincy court, the cops all circled round the guy and read his girlfriend's testimony to the clerk. It wasn't even carried over to the D.A. When I objected that the testimony presented wasn't even mine, the clerk said, ""It doesn't have to be. You may be the victim but you're only a witness as far as the state is concerned. And the cop could use anyone's testimony."" But the impression was that it was MY testimony, not the thug's girlfriend's. So this was an idealization of justice moving along toward the correct verdict. . The jury foreman was key: if he had been dictatorial, it would never have gotten to the point of free exchange. Because he was passive, Fonda was able to take over. I doubt that this was at all realistic. THat's why they choose jurors without college educations: so the ignorant can be swayed by the lawyers. These jurors were evenly divided, with the less well educated being the more ethical, interestingly enough. Lee J Cobb, as the father of the estranged son, and the last holdout, did a magnificent job as a bitter angry man, who would have liked to send the kid to the chair out of his own anger. Fonda was great as the Jesus figure. Too bad he couldn't have brought a little more of that to his daughter, Jane. The weather also starred in this movie: the heat added to the pressure. When Fonda helps the various jurors open or shut the windows, he also subconsciously makes them his allies in his fight for truth. The screenwriter did well to keep him neutral. He doesn't know if the kid did it: he just wants them to discuss the situation before they kill him. In the course of the discussion, the jurors actually create a trial that didn't exist. Interesting legal question: can you judge a man by the inferences you draw from what may or may not have been said at the trial? In other words, is it 'legal' to use means other than what the defense did to acquit the defendant? A trick that wasn't used: no body died. I thought for sure the old guy or the angry guy would have a heart attack in the heat, and they would have to bring in one of the alternates, adding to the character study. Great movie. I""m sure when I see it again, I'll find even more in it. But I did love how the Casper Milquetoasts were empowered to find their own voices.Easy to see why this is one of the greatest movies of all time. The writer was magnificent and i don't even remember his name.!!!!! Fonda without a good script would be Paris Hilton.",12 Angry Men

198,emperor_bender,A movie for those with a taste for GOOD movies,10,4 June 2008,"I have seen this movie a few times throughout the years and have always liked it.However, a lot of people bash it for stupid reasons.In high school, our 10th grade English class had to watch this. However, everyone immediately booed the movie for being ""too boring"" or ""too old"".And I read one ""Hated It"" comment here on IMDb. By user Jonathan Kwok. He claims this movie was bad because it was in black and white....and thats all. No supporting evidence, no in-depth details, no anything.It's safe to say that movies like 12 Angry Men are becoming more and more rare in favor of modern, dumbed down movies for our modern non-thinking public. And comments such as that are proof.The movie took something so basic as reaching a verdict and turned it into a cinematic masterpiece.Anyway, onto the film itself. There was not much music evident with 12 Angry Men, but thats what made it so suspenseful.Performance-wise, there are 12 excellent performances. Particularly Henry Fonda as Juror #8, the only one to stand up for his argument against all the others. Joseph Sweeney was also excellent as Juror #9, the observant, elderly juror who soon stands up for Juror #8. I personally also enjoyed John Fiedler as the meek, more quiet Juror #2; Jack Warden as the witty, smart-mouth Juror #7; and Jack Klugman as the slum-raised Juror #5.I really liked this movie, regardless of when it was made. That should not be a factor when viewing a movie.This is definitely a classic. Those with tastes for good films should check this one out.

I'm glad they didn't show a re-enactment of the crime, or definitively say whether the kid was innocent or not, as the film's not really about the crime at all. It could be the best character study ever told, even though we know none of the character's names until the end (and then only two of them) nor what they're like outside of the jury room. The only weak spot I found among the ensemble was Juror #2, I just found him incredibly irritating and was surprised the other jurors - especially #3 - didn't rage at him at all.

201,roghache,"THE classic jury drama, compelling but not without flaws",8,24 April 2009,"This is surely the most famous film jury drama, quite riveting in its dialogue, its claustrophobic jury deliberation room setting, its brilliantly depicted characters, its atmosphere of oppressive heat and tension between these jurors. The twelve angry men are admittedly largely one dimensional stereotypes but they are brought vividly to life by a star studded cast including Henry Fonda, E.G. Marshall, Leo J. Cobb, and Jack Klugman.The jurors include an arrogant stockbroker, a stressed out man from a poor social background, a wise and endearing old gentleman, a quiet and respectful immigrant, an extreme bigot, a loud and pushy businessman with son issues, an advertising executive who sees everything in terms of sales, and a sports fan interested only in getting out in time to see his ballgame. The jury foreman tries to keep the group organized but isn't a particularly bright or thoughtful man himself and seems in over his depth. The (supposed at least) hero of the piece is the intelligent juror number 8, an architect, who appears to take his responsibilities seriously. He encourages full discussion of the evidence when others seem happy to return an immediate Guilty verdict for a young Hispanic defendant accused of fatally stabbing his abusive father. As a result of this juror's persuasive powers, the vote changes from 11-1 for Guilty to a unanimous final Not Guilty verdict.No one would be interested in watching a movie about twelve calm jurors politely and rationally debating the evidence. Thus we have this drama which makes for compelling viewing but isn't for those preferring some degree of subtlety. The case itself is ultra dramatic 'all or nothing', acquittal or the death penalty with no possibility of life imprisonment. Juror 8 has illegally purchased a duplicate knife to the murder weapon and slams it dramatically on the table. These jurors are constantly bickering. One juror threatens to kill another. Eventually the other jurors all turn their backs one by one on the bigot. Surely this must be a textbook example of everything a jury should NOT be! While real life jurors do bring their prejudices and life experiences into the jury room, some of these jurors were simply too unbelievable. For example, 'the bigot' seemed to flaunt his bigotry at every turn rather than, as would be much more realistic, making some effort to conceal it. I believe one would need to look far and wide to find a juror with so little regard for human life that he would happily send a possibly innocent kid off to the electric chair rather than miss his ballgame.As for juror number 8, at first I admired his sense of responsibility and calm, reasoned questioning. However, by the end of the movie, after he had raised doubts (whether reasonable or not is up to individual interpretation) about every single piece of evidence and testimony, I no longer saw him as the heroic champion of justice we're manipulated into believing, but almost felt as though he had some agenda of his own to acquit and would never convict anyone of any crime, whatever the evidence! This jury didn't rationally debate the case at all but as juror 8 would raise some 'doubt', one or other juror would suddenly change his vote, ignoring all the other evidence. A good case could be made that this jury let a murderer go free because they lost sight of the cumulative nature of the evidence as a whole.While this movie is often classed as a character study, a psychological drama, or a study in small group dynamics, it's also considered a commentary on the American jury system. As such, I feel that the writers should have 'done their homework' and had these jurors follow standard jury instructions rather than the gross jury misconduct they displayed -- juror 8 doing his own independent research by purchasing that knife, their questionable little experiment with the old man's rate of walking, their improper acceptance of one of their number as a switchblade 'expert' and taking his opinion of stabbing techniques as gospel. If all this had become known to court officials in real life, this grievous misconduct would almost certainly have resulted in a mistrial.I also felt the movie quite manipulative in casting a defendant who could hardly be more sympathetic, a young kid with poor social opportunities, the victim of bigotry and paternal abuse. What viewer would ever want this boy to receive the death penalty? This film would have packed a greater punch for me if the defendant had been a rather despicable character (or at least neutral in terms of sympathy factor), yet the jury been able to acquit him anyway due to finding reasonable doubt.Therefore, while this film is a 'must see' classic, a thoroughly engaging way to spend an hour and a half, and a masterpiece by comparison with most modern movies, I don't consider it flawless. At least in my case, it hasn't held up well during subsequent viewings and further scrutiny. Entertaining, yes, but I have a big problem with its clearly intended message that this jury, which I see as a lynch mob-turned-group of pushovers, has ultimately served the cause of justice.",12 Angry Men

The script is as boxed in as our jurors are creating a tense cin-experience that doesn't waste words or time. An idealism of American justice is countered by a mob mentality in this war of words. The quality acting aptly balances out the democratic message as each juror listens past their own snap judgements. A score more suitable for a sci-fi B movie can't derail the sharp 12 Angry Men drama. While many courtroom dramas are memorable, it is the back room drama that feels much more personable. I find myself trying to identify which each and every juror as they are quite developed in their annoying, corny, obnoxious and gentlemanly ways.

205,h-28658,The kind of films that leaves you thinking about it for days.,9,4 July 2020,Such thought-provoking stories are a real rarity nowadays and now I will try to explain why.The atmosphere during the discussion of12completely different people who decided the fate of a child and struggled with their own internal contradictions showed how tense assize court can be.This is one of the mechanisms that can give people chance to save or to take human life-each small detail matters and the director of this picture successfully coped with their creation.,12 Angry Men
206,Danny_G13,Greatest movie ever made,10,28 May 2007,"Deceptively complex courtroom drama enthrals for the duration as one man opposes eleven others in a battle of argument, reason, and logic.Starring Henry Fonda as Juror #8, 12 Angry Men is a very claustrophobic drama which conveys the deliberation room of a trial where the defendant is accused of first-degree murder. On the surface the case seems open and shut, with 11 of the 12 jurors entirely convinced by the prosecution's case. Only one dissenter remains, and that is Henry Fonda's Juror #8. Specifically he is not certain that the boy is definitely innocent, just that he doesn't know, and that for him is enough to qualify as reasonable doubt.12 Angry Men certainly is a moralistic tale, of the right to a fair trial and trying to give someone every chance, but it has many more strings to its bow than just this. Indeed, above all else it prides itself in endeavouring to portray a true sense of reasoned and rational argument which tries to overcome steadfast beliefs as possessed by the seemingly unshakable. Initially it may seem that Fonda's Juror is simply playing devil's advocate, but it becomes clear that it is more about standing up for what you believe despite what the facts seem to tell you. The more you scrutinise so-called unshakable evidence, the more you find holes in it, and the more that logical analysis seems to provide the real answers.Obviously, Juror #8 has to persuade those others who seem to have their own agenda, and pre-conceived notions of what truth equals, but nevertheless it is absolutely fascinating seeing how simply he probes the case and reveals the flaws.The whole movie's pace is absolutely perfect, and given its almost exclusive setting of inside the deliberation room it is a testament to the genius of the script and the brilliance of the acting that the duration of the film seems so short. The cinematography is also surprisingly excellent given the lack of scope necessary, with sharp imagery and clever camera-work which gives the whole picture a real amount of life.To detail the jurors themselves; Juror #1 reluctantly appoints himself foreman. He appears to lack esteem, and the chance to boss the table by being the 'leader' perversely appeals greatly to him as he lacks significant contribution to make about the case. He does not want to be useless, so is forced to take charge.Juror #2 is a slight man who is clearly used to being wrapped in his own cocoon, never deviating, so when he ends up as a juror in a murder trial, he is actually thrilled at his fish out of water status. He does not really have much to say about the case, taking it at face value.Juror #3 is the enduring Messenger Service owner. May have an ulterior motive for being so steadfastly sure the accused is guilty, given his first scene depicts ambivalence over the courtroom procedure given to him it is 'open and shut'. As time goes on, and evidence starts to suggest more than meets the eye, he begins to show emotional stress as his hardwired opinion looks flimsier. But he refuses to cave.Juror #4 has more emotional attachment to the trial than most, as he shares the same kind of background to the defendant and takes criticism of 'that kind of person' extremely personally. Experiences inner conflict between head and heart.Juror #5 is a cold and methodical thinker who has an elevated opinion of himself. Emerges more as the deliberations wear on, he is convinced by the evidence that the boy is guilty, and systematically sets about conveying this to the others.Juror #6 is the common working man with very little input, and whose two significant moments are to defend another juror who is being harassed, and to suggest another juror is badly wrong about his opinion.Juror #7 is more interested in the ball game at 8pm than the case. Doesn't want to be there, and while he details a little about the boy's background to start off with, his regular sarcastic quips throughout the story suggest he is simply desperate to be out of there as quickly as possible, with no care about the wheels of justice.Juror #8 is the only juror who does not immediately join the others with their guilty verdict. He has a lot of thought about the case eating at him, and wishes to explore it. He meets much opposition.Juror #9 is a wise, wiley old man who is sharper than anyone else and observed events in the courtroom closer than the others. Makes some smart observations which unearth vital truths.Juror #10 is an old school racist whose opinion is based on prejudice and not facts. A vile and odious creature, he has no interest in 'people like that' roaming the streets, and is offended at having to live in the same city as them.Juror #11 is an intelligent and interested spectator who listens to the facts and analyses them before reaching a conclusion. His European accent draws derision from some others, as does his general nationality, but he rises above it and provides some sensible comments, rarely saying anything which lacks thought.Juror #12 is a good-natured man but not a terribly strong thinker. He does not have much of an independent opinion on the case, often following others, and is often more interested in playing naughts and crosses or boring fellow jurors about his job.Overall, 12 Angry Men is simply as good as cinema can get. Incredible script, amazing performances, and captivating direction.Highly recommended.",12 Angry Men
207,Rockwell_Cronenberg,Quality work all around.,7,21 February 2012,"What is there to be said that hasn't already been said? It's earned it's status as a classic for a reason. While I wouldn't go so far as to call it one of the greatest of all time, it is a vastly entertaining take on a brilliant premise that has been used throughout the decades sense. The dialogue is sharp, the character turns are believable and interesting and the whole thing flows along at a swift pace. When it was over I couldn't believe that so much time had gone by. I'm always fascinated by films that take place entirely in one location (or almost entirely) and this was one of the early precedents for the kind of greatness one can accomplish when that is utilized properly.The ominous surroundings like the heat and the storm add nice bits of tension to the rising tempers of the men in the room and the confrontations between the soft Henry Fonda and the explosive Lee J. Cobb were intense. Sidney Lumet is a man who earned his reputation as an ""actor's director"" and made his career out of mostly setting up the stage and aiding his actors in doing what they do best, but I think his stylistic choices here deserve to be commended. The way that he slowly brings the camera down over the course of the film, bringing us more intimately into the heart of this room, it adds that sense of claustrophobia that makes the tension even more gripping as we proceed into the later stages of it all.Practically everyone in the cast shines at one point or another, my favorites being the commanding Fonda who is able to be the voice of reason without being annoying, the pensive E.G. Marshall, the racist and volatile Ed Begley and the wise, determined Joseph Sweeney. The film had plenty of great twists, like the knife reveal, but my favorite scene had to be Begley going off on his offensive monologue while one-by-one the jurors turned away from him until he realized that his ignorance had caused him to lose any voice he once had; a powerfully real moment. I also loved the added touch of putting Fonda in an all white suit while everyone else was in shades of black or grey.",12 Angry Men
208,mmallon4,...and Justice for All,10,24 March 2018,"I don't think I can bestow a higher statement of praise on a film than to call it a life-changing experience. 12 Angry Men influenced me not to believe everything I hear, instead to question things and ultimately turning me into a more skeptical person; there is more to life than meets the eye (or ear). It's one of few films which helped shape who I am as a person. When watching it I constantly visualise the details in my head of the events and locations of the murder case being described. At the beginning of the film, all the jurors bar one believe the boy in question is guilty of murdering his father. By the end of the film, they all change their vote to not guilty. How is this possible? Why just the most incredible 90-minute exhibition of human psychology and argumentation. I enjoy never knowing what really happened; did the kid commit murder or not? - It's up for the viewer to decide. 12 Angry Men is a movie that is hard to write a review for; I wouldn't be surprised if I come back to add more since I find myself watching 12 Angry Men at least once a year. With layer upon layer upon layer, this is a movie I could talk about hours, and always finding new aspects to discuss on each viewing. As the exposition reveals more details of the case I am left saying in the words of Milhouse Van Houten, ""Tell me more!"". - Ah the pure joy of an engrossing, wordy, civil debate.On every viewing of 12 Angry Men I find myself focusing on a different character. I'd have to watch the 12 times in order to fully explore every character, all representative of personalities we're likely to encounter in real life'; I'm sure I've encountered each one at some point in my life. This is a movie that needed a cast comprised of character actors (aside from Henry Fonda) in order to create such distinct personalities - the characters are believable without being two-dimensional stereotypes. Not all of them leave prejudice at the door; it's more obvious with some than others. Not all of them really take much interest in the case or have much pride being part of a jury and even treating it as a bit of a joke at times; even the judge at the beginning doesn't to be very enthusiastic about the case at hand. They even display different levels of confidence and surety in their opinions - when every juror announces they have changed their mind you can see on their faces how difficult that admission is.12 Angry Men provides possibly the best cinematic insight into group conflict and argumentation. Like with a jury or a classroom full of people, this large variety of personalities are unlikely to converge elsewhere in a small space for a period of time in which they have to communicate with each other, such as what John Hughes would explore with his teen detention drama in 1985 with The Breakfast Club. You really get a sense of who likes who and who doesn't as the heat beats down in that claustrophobic space. Director Sidney Lumet made the cast spend time with each other before filming and it certainly helped. I don't feel like I'm watching actors, I feel like I'm watching a group of everyday people in a jury. As not all US states at the time opened their doors to having women present within juires; the film is not 12 Angry Men and Women. I imagine the feminine point of few would have influenced the examination of the proceedings; just think of Grace Kelly's female instincts from Rear Window.The cast:Juror #1 (Martin Balsam):
The Jury Foreman. He doesn't express any opinion or reasons for changing his vote, taking a neutral stance and moderates the proceedings.Juror #2 (John Fiedler):
Nerdy and socially awkward; reminds me of Rick Moranis. I find it interesting that he is placed sitting beside Lee J. Cobb's Juror #3 as the two are polar opposites. He finds it difficult to articulate an opinion at first but grows confidence and later stands up to the other jurors.Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb):
Lee J. Cobb is my favourite of the cast, in my view being the most interesting and complex character with the biggest ark as the opinionated and brash antagonist, Juror #3; ultimately stealing the show. He seems fair and rational at first until we gradually discover he wants to boy on trial found guilty for personal reasons. He is by far the most confrontational juror as he contests every single rebuttal thrown his way and never concedes a good point. This is a strategy that even leads him to shoot himself in the foot when he destroys his own argument by frantically stating ""he was an old man, half the time he was confused, how could be positive about anything?"" Juror #3's breakdown at the end is a highlight in a film full of awe-inspiring performances. His angry outburst to Fonda that he'll kill him followed by Fonda's response of ""You don't really mean you'll kill me, do you?"", is surely one of the greatest zingers in cinema history.Juror #4 (E. G. Marshall):
A cold-hearted individual which is reflected by his wearing of a jacket throughout the whole 90 minutes despite the heat. He is a metaphorical representation of cold, hard facts. He is arguably the most competent and restrained debater and also a bit of a 'know it all' which makes it all the more interesting and satisfying when he changes his vote. Likewise, the movies and stars mentioned during his cross-examination by Juror #8 are not real (yes I looked them up).
Juror #5 (Jack Klugman):
Comes from a slum background although his appearance doesn't suggest this. He even votes guilty on two occasions despite the boy on trail coming from his same background. His decision to change his vote could have been influenced by the accusation from Juror #3 (both still being a member of the guilty party at this point) that he had changed his vote due to sharing the same background the boy on trial, when in fact he hadn't changed his vote.Juror #6 (Edward Binns):
The most normal juror, doesn't stand out - a very regular John Doe. He even states he's not a ""supposing man"" and that his boss does all the supposing. He doesn't have anything to add when asked for his opinion, just repeating points that have already been made in an unsure manner.Juror #7 (Jack Warden):
Clearly doesn't want to be there, doesn't care about the case and even bullies and tries to intimidate other jurors. He has no respect for the grounds with his gum-chewing and litter throwing and although he never outright says he wants to leave and go to the ball game which he has tickets for, it's painfully obvious from the beginning what his true intent is.Juror #8/Davis (Henry Fonda):
The film's protagonist and the outsider of the jury. A soft-spoken and rarely confrontational man who is brave enough to stand up to the collective and going against popular opinion, even when the rest of them get frustrated with him. Fonda like in many of his movies is a beacon of truth and justice here, but he doesn't come off as unbelievable saintly - even with his wearing of a white suit. The scene in which he puts his knife in the table is a gasping moment if there ever was one.Juror #9/McCardle (Joseph Sweeney):
The most elderly member of the jury. Juror #1 states he should be respected because of that, and I believe this is deserved because of his knowledge as well as his confidence in Juror #8.Juror #10 (Ed Begley):
The most obviously bigoted member of the jury and thus ultimately doesn't prove to be a huge help to the proceedings with talking out of turn multiple tie, his prejudiced rants or his hypocrisy in defending the woman's statement despite her also being ""one of them too"". At one point he even suggests telling a funny story he heard rather than discussing the case and eventually gets expelled from the table when his bigotry is denied an audienceJuror #11 (George Voskovec):
An Eastern European immigrant (possibly from behind the Iron Curtain) who takes more pride in the American justice system as well as democracy than any of the American members of the Jury, even defending it such as when Juror #10 demands that Juror #5 reveals his voting choice. Likewise, I love his statement to Juror #2 in response to what side he is on: ""I don't believe I have to be loyal to one side or the other, I'm simply asking questions"". Juror #11 is a watchmaker who regularly points out the time. Ah, I see what you did there movie!Juror #12 (Robert Webber):
A huckster in the advertising business which makes sense as he himself has a very manufactured look. I get the impression he represents 1950's conformity with his appearance, looking like a character from a Rock Hudson/Doris Day comedy with his very 50's glasses and hair. He goes along with the crowd, even changing his vote more than once.Is Jury Duty really this incredible in the real world? At the end of 12 Angry Men I wonder if the jurors are aware that they've just experienced probably the most incredible 90 minutes of their lives.",12 Angry Men
209,ozthegreatat42330,This is what the art and craft of fine film making is all about.,10,5 May 2007,"This film plays so well because of the confining space of the set, the choice to film in black and white, which itself becomes an element of the action, but most of all because of the impressive cast led by the ever magnificent Henry Fonda. It was once said that two actors epitomized the average American and they were Jimmy Stewart and Henry Fonda. Here he is the lone juror in a murder trial that is unsure that the defendant is guilty. He slowly and logically begins to change the minds of the other jurors as they swelter and suffer together in the miserable Jury room. With the exception of the first few minutes of the film the entire action takes place in that confining space as the men behind the masks begin to show their true selves. This is, hands down, a powerhouse film of the first order. This is what film drama is all about.",12 Angry Men
210,happipuppi13,12 wonderful actors.,10,17 January 2006,"(January,2006) I'll start by saying that if there's anyone who rates this film as ""hated it"",they obviously don't know hard hitting / good drama when they see it. These 12 actors performances are so alive, vital and powerful, it's amazing to think this film didn't win Best Picture that year. Henry Fonda gives a simplistic yet very deep performance in the way his character says ""not guilty"" but wisely does not say,""I know he's not"". that would've undermined the whole of his performance.Lee J. Cobb is fantastic as not just prejudiced like the other older male juror but just angry inside at everything. Especially when Fonda calls him a ""sadist"". John Fielder always great as the meek yet outspoken kind. Jack Warden as a guy who'd rather be at the ballgame than having his life interrupted for something he could care less about.E.G. Marshall gives a quiet yet strong performance as well. A man who is so ""sure and certain"" about everything. Only to be proved wrong later. The rest are fantastic in their own ways as well.Since most of us here are familiar with the story, I wont go into it but I will say I really love how Henry Fonda finally breaks the last two hold-outs into voting ""not guilty"" for the right reasons.10 stars because it is justifiably so.

211,jcbutthead86,"One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Unforgettable And Powerful Classic From Sidney Lumet.",10,18 January 2014,"12 Angry Men is one of the greatest films ever made and an excellent and unforgettable Classic from Sidney Lumet that combines amazing direction,a terrific cast,a wonderful script and a fantastic score making 12 Angry Men one of my favorite films,Sidney Lumet at his best and cinema at it's best.Set in New York City,12 Angry Men tells the story of 12 jurors who have to decide the fate of a young boy who's been accused of murdering his Father. While the 11 other jurors think the boy's guilty and the case is open and shut,one juror,juror#8(Henry Fonda)Isn't so sure and think they should discuss the case and change the other jurors including juror#3(Lee J. Cobb)verdicts and convince the jurors that the boy is not guilty.12 Angry Men is a brilliant classic that marked the directorial debut of director Sidney Lumet and also gave viewers one of the finest courtroom dramas ever made. What separates 12 Angry Men from other courtroom dramas is the setting because where other Courtroom dramas take place in and out of the courtroom,12 Angry en takes place mostly inside of a jury room. Right from the moment when the characters enter the jury room viewers are given an riveting and powerful film that has no gunfights,explosions,fist fights or car chases but is one of the most intense and emotionally charged films of all time. When you watch 12 Angry Men you are in the minds of the 12 jurors who are making a choice about a persons life whether they decide that the young boy is guilty or not testing our thoughts and what would we do if we were in a situation like that. 12 Angry Men not only succeeds as a court room drama but as a character study as well because as we watch the film and see all 12 of the jurors we see who they really are outside of the jury room bringing their personal feelings about who they are whether it's about the case or how they feel about each other and the characters are well-developed and interesting. The film also deals with themes such as racism and prejudice in a intelligent and thoughtful way that is still powerful and relevant. Another thing I love about 12 Angry Men is the visually stunning photography and atmosphere. Boris Kaufman's black and white photography is beautiful and haunting adding to the movie's intensity and as emotions run high the photography becomes more dreary and dark. I also love the fact that most of the movie takes place in one room which gives the movie a claustrophobic feel and as 12 Angry Men keeps going the room becomes more enclosed and isolated where you feel like the characters will never get out. Also,the fact that 12 Angry Men takes place on a hot and humid day adds to the tension of the main characters because the jurors are not angry just because of the decision they have to make as jurors but also the heat. When you watch this film you will feel the heat coming of the screen. All the jurors are great characters but the two who are the most fascinating are jurors number#8 and #3 because both pretty much represent the voices of the film. Juror #8 Isn't convinced that the boy is guilty wanting to talk to the other jurors and convince them by asking questions and making a case. You will root and relate to juror#8 because of his determination and persistence that never stops. Where as juror#8 thinks the boy Isn't guilty,juror#3 is convinced right away that the boy is guilty from the start not just because of the facts presented in the case but because of the things going on in his personal life that affects his decision and when the other jurors are talking about the case juror #3 explodes with anger and rage not understanding why would they continue with this case. Juror#8 and #3 are classic and unforgettable characters who anchor the film and have a complexity that adds to the film. The screenplay by Reginald Rose is terrific,with Rose giving the characters memorable dialog as well as scenes that are amazing and will stick with viewers. The ending of 12 Angry Men is fantastic and in my opinion one of the best endings in movie history with non-stop greatness and intensity that you will never forget. A powerful and outstanding conclusion.The whole cast is amazing in their roles. Henry Fonda is excellent and at his best as Juror#8,with Fonda bringing depth and a heroic quality to the role. Lee J. Cobb is brilliant and fiery in one of my favorite performances in film history as Juror#3,with Cobb bringing intensity,anger and complexity to the role and having great scenes with Fonda. E.G Marshall is terrific as Juror#4,an intelligent stockbroker. Joseph Sweeney is wonderful as Juror#9,an observant and elderly juror. Ed Begley is riveting as Juror#10,a man full of racism,hate and prejudice. Jack Warden is outstanding as Juror#7,with Warden bringing humor to the film. Jack Klugman is fantastic as Juror#12,a man with a slum background. George Voskovic is sensational as Juror#11,a European Juror. John Fiedler(Juror#2),Martin Balsam(Juror#1,The Foreman),Robert Webber(Juror#12)and Edward Binns(Juror#6)give great performances as well. The direction by Sidney Lumet is amazing and stylish,with Lumet constantly moving the camera and showing close-ups,over head shots keeping the film moving at an incredible pace with a wonderful visual style. Terrific direction,Lumet. The score Kenyon Hopkins is great,memorable and intense and matches the film's tone. Amazing score,Hopkins.In final word,if you love Sidney Lumet,Henry Fonda,Courtroom Dramas or cinema,I highly suggest you see 12 Angry Men,an excellent and unforgettable classic that you will watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",12 Angry Men

214,gpeevers,Incredibly Good Film,10,1 April 2019,"An incredible film that is even more incredible for the fact that it was filmed almost entirely in one small room and was made on a surprisingly small budget. The film did have a top Hollywood star in Henry Fonda but while director Sidney Lumet would go on to an amazing career this was his first work outside of television. The film earned 3 important Oscar nominations for Best Film, Best Direction and Best Writing but would lose all three categories to Bridge on the River Kwai and was not successful at the box office. Despite all this more than 50 years later this film currently sits at #5 on the IMDB Top 250 films of all time, a position that I believe is justified.The film is essentially the story of a jury deliberation of a murder case involving a Hispanic youth that initially appears to be clear cut until one man raises questions mostly to ensure that everyone has given the case their full consideration, when doubts arise the tempers flare and the prejudices of some jury member's surface. Now instead of an exercise in fair play we have the juror's undertaking a decision that will determine the fate of a young man whose innocence becomes more and more likely.The most effective aspects of Lumet's direction are making a film that is almost entirely dialogue in one room incredibly compelling and making that single set dramatic and effective. The tension mounts through out the film as the deliberation nears it conclusion and Lumet adjusts the cameras and the lenses to build a feeling of claustrophobia in the small extremely hot jury room.The other major contributor was Reginald Rose who wrote the screenplay and co-produced the film with Fonda.In addition to Fonda in what I believe is his best career performance we have host of recognizable faces including; Martin Balsam, Lee J Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Warden, Ed Begley and one very recognizable voice is John Fiedler who better known as the voice of Piglet in Winnie the Pooh.",12 Angry Men
215,TheHonestCritic,"There are at least 12 reasons why this ""movie"" sucks.....",4,7 November 2020,"""12 Angry Men"" (1957), I have heard people go nuts over this ""film"", time and time again. The hype was insane between everyone I've heard who mentioned anything about it or anything related to it. So, I finally gave in and put it on. What a major disappointment! It is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the top 10 most boring films I've ever seen in my life. I've seen a lot of dull and boring movies, but this ""film"" excels at both of those aspects. This ""movie"" has a boring story, standard to horrible acting and a generic dull soundtrack. As far as the story goes, it's one of the most uninteresting, boring, unnecessary and unbearable I've ever seen. It's only 96 minutes, but it felt like I was watching it for days! The storyline is, 12 jurors argue on whether a person is guilty or not guilty. Seriously, that's the whole movie, just 12 boring characters sitting in a boring room talking. How riveting! Right? You might as well hide a couple of video cameras in a jury room and press record, same thing! Now, I have seen movies before that take place in a single setting from beginning to end. Some were good, some were bad. ""12 Angry Men"" is probably one of the worst examples of how not to make a film taking place in the same location. It was so dull, that I could barely fight to keep my eyes open! Another big issue is lack of character development. The main characters are cast as: Juror 1, Juror 2, etc. Yes, we do find out their names at the end when they introduce themselves. That's one of the biggest cardinal rules when making a movie or TV show, character development. This ""movie"" has virtually none of that. The only positive about this ""film"" is that it somehow inspired a lot of tributes and parodies on TV shows. Those were so much more entertaining than this pile of filth! Before you guys tell me, ""it's realistic, this movie is supposed to be as close to a real-life scenario as possible."" I'm all for movies with realism. When done right, it can be very effective! ""12 Angry Men"" is a little bit too real. Wow, I never thought I'd hear myself say that! Overall, the plot of this ""movie"" is so bad, that describing my feelings toward it as angry is an understatement. That's one of the two worst things a film can do; anger me, or bore me. ""12 Angry Men"" does both! As far as the acting goes, it's just as bad, unfortunately. From the whole entire cast! The only ones who actually seem to be trying are Henry Fonda, E.G. Marshall, Martin Balsam and Jack Warden. All of the rest of the performances were either bad or just plain boring. It's a real pity, because all of these actors are great in other movies and TV shows. What happened here? Finally, the soundtrack in this ""movie"" is overall very generic and not memorable in the least. There are a couple of parts of the film score that aren't too bad. The opening theme during the opening credits and the ending theme. As for the rest of the soundtrack, it's just a failing pile of trash. Now, let's get to the positive elements in this ""film"". Yes, surprisingly, this ""movie"" has some good things in it. All of the sets/locations and the special effects are good. The only thing that almost cost the sets/locations star is that it is in black and white. That just accentuates the boredom of the environment. But, it suits the story, or lack thereof, in this ""movie"". So, I still give it a pass at the end of the day. Finally, the special effects are good and still hold up to this day. My only nitpick is that all of the words in the opening and closing credits are all lower case. Did a kid write the titles and credits? Or, did someone forget to capitalize? ""12 Angry Men"" has found a place on my most disappointing films list and most boring films list. It's a real shame, because I really tried so hard to like it. But, it did next to nothing for me. I'm struggling to rate this ""film"" 2 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Just stay away from ""12 Angry Men"", it sucks, plain and simple. The sad thing is, that there are schmucks out there who like it, and some even consider it to be their favorite movie! Why? What are you all drinking?

Period!,10,29 December 2000,"For a film that takes places almost 100% of its entire time in one room with 12 actors, it is a brilliant piece of work not just for its great acting, but for its relevance.Anyone seeing this film today, can remark on how the wheels of justice are no different than the trials of today, that people are filled with good faith, that there are people who are innocent, that there are times when what you see is not the entire truth, that people are cruel, that people are bigots, that people are heartless-disconcerting and these things still haunt us in our present lives, but mostly that someone can stand for their beliefs when everyone is against them and overcome them.So perfectly portrayed.

217,Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,One of the best ever,10,17 June 2008,"Sidney Lumet's directorial debut remains a tense, atmospheric (though slightly manipulative and stagy) courtroom thriller, in which the viewer never sees a trial and the only action is verbal. As he does in his later corruption commentaries such as Serpico or Q & A, Lumet focuses on the lonely one-man battles of a protagonist whose ethics alienate him from the rest of jaded society. As the film opens, the seemingly open-and-shut trial of a young Puerto Rican accused of murdering his father with a knife has just concluded and the 12-man jury retires to their microscopic, sweltering quarters to decide the verdict. When the votes are counted, 11 men rule guilty, while one--played by Henry Fonda, again typecast as another liberal, truth-seeking hero--doubts the obvious. Stressing the idea of ""reasonable doubt,"" Fonda slowly chips away at the jury, who represent a microcosm of white, male society--exposing the prejudices and preconceptions that directly influence the other jurors' snap judgments. The tight script by Reginald Rose (based on his own tele play) presents each juror vividly using detailed soliloquies, all which are expertly performed by the film's flawless cast. Still, it's Lumet's claustrophobic direction--all sweaty close-ups and cramped compositions within a one-room setting--that really transforms this contrived story into an explosive and compelling nail-biter.Starring: Martin Balsham, John Fiedler, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Jack Wardem. Director: Sidney Lumet.",12 Angry Men

The acting is first class and the story is compelling.  I was taken by the civility of the group.  The few loud mouths were berated for their poor behavior.  It was refreshing to see especially when compared to the lack of any manners or social conscience of the cast of modern movies. Today's heros are selfish mean-spirited thugs who have no redeeming qualities besides getting the money or the whorey babe at the end of the movie.  The quality called ""an edge"" in so many characters in modern movies is a result of the writing of Hollywood hacks who don't know any better.  I believe it reflects the values of the Hollywood culture and it is no wonder independent movies are popular.  See ""12 Angry Men"". The movie is well worth seeing.",12 Angry Men

Although the lead actor in the strong cast is Henry Fonda (who's excellent here), I'm particularly impressed with Lee J.

Praise to Sidney Lumet for being able to creatively work around with the cast in a confined space, without boring the viewers. The screenplay is exceptional, highly entertaining, yet allowing room for intelligent thoughts (of viewers) to roam.

223,ReelCheese,"So Simple, So Brilliant",9,28 September 2006,"So simple yet so brilliant, 12 ANGRY MEN is not to be missed. It's the tale of the meticulous Mr. Davis, a juror not quite convinced of a murder suspect's guilt despite what appears to be overwhelming evidence. His questions gradually persuade his fellow jurors that things aren't always as open-and-shut as they might seem.One of the great all-time ensemble casts highlights 12 ANGRY MEN. Henry Fonda is superb as the hardcore skeptic... but then again, everyone is superb, from Joseph Sweeney as the eldest juror to E.G. Marshall as the no-nonsense Juror #4. Anytime a film set almost exclusively at a single cramped table in a single cramped room can spellbound the viewer, you know you've got first-rate actors. The clever, colorful dialog is a treat as well.Yet the strongest asset of 12 ANGRY MEN is the demands it makes of the viewer to think critically. Initially we are like most of the jurors, curious as to how Fonda can be so naive to think the young suspect may be innocent. But he gradually pulls us into his line of reasoning, challenging our assumptions and finding fault with the supposed facts. By the film's end, we're left wondering how we could have been so narrow-minded just 90 minutes earlier.As sharp as what's on screen is, 12 ANGRY MEN is equally smart for what it does not show. Many of today's filmgoers would demand flashback sequences to depict what the characters describe. They would want to get to know the accused killer so they could judge him for themselves. They would want more action, more pizazz, and changes of scenery. Yet it's precisely the film's refusal to do any of this that makes it work so well. The viewer is effectively the 13th juror with nothing but recollections of testimony to go on. Our imaginations are free to create a picture of the alleged murder, just as we would have to as part of the jury.12 ANGRY MEN is often cited as one of the greatest films ever. It's a verdict that is well deserved.",12 Angry Men

I've always thought the jury system was imperfect - 12 people from the general population - none of them lawyers, and most if not all, by the laws of probability,,not versed in legal idiosyncrasies. It only takes one very strong, articulate and confident juror to be able to convince the other 11. None of them are trained. It's all pretty much based on gut feeling. And most of us are sheep. Even though I've always thought - via my untrained instinct - that the jury system was fundamentally flawed, I've never really seen it challenged in film or conveyed in such a powerful way as 12 angry men did. Not only was the film entertaining on a theatrical level, it also rings true today. Is there a better system to judge guilt or innocence? I don't know. But this film demonstrates that the current system (bear in mind this was released in 1957) is anything but foolproof. A thought provoking yet entertaining 8 out of ten",12 Angry Men

Quality performers meet deep message. The most obvious flaw in this supposed classic, one of the most super-estimated films in history was as follows: real juries are allowed neither to carry their own experiences nor to consider evidence not presented at trial. If the jury had acted in accordance with the correct legal procedure, there would have been no basis for the plot, therefore no drama, therefore no catharsis. An intriguing theme doesn't always result in a good production. What shall I call a movie including clichéd, implausible characters, and a foreseeable twist (a 11-to-1 vote changing into 0-to-12)? Juries exist in order to allow the cold letter of the law to be broken, or temporarily suspended. That's what they're all about. That's their raison d'être. A judge can acquit a suspicious defendant for lack of evidence. A jury may convict him or her for ""feeling his or her"" guilt. The institution of the jury was thus an historical way to ""humanize"" lawsuits.

The rest of the film takes place in a jury room where disagreements, powerful arguments and strong points from the 12 jurors are made.At the beginning, it is decided that a preliminary vote should be taken to see where everything stands; 11 vote Guilty, but Henry Fonda votes 'Not Guilty' because he is not sure - this man respects the notion of reasonable doubt and he is willing to discuss before sending the man to the electric chair. The accused is actually a young kid (18 years of age) from the slums and many jurors immediately condemn him because of his breed and branding such people as 'liars and murderers'. Although Fonda meets stiff opposition at the beginning, opinions swing here and there until the very end where Lee. J Cobb brakes down shouting 'Not Guilty'.It is rare to see a film so simple yet so stirring and poignant in its meaning and value. What this film exposes so successfully is how the lives of men lie in the hands of 12 random people many who may just want to finish and go home, refuse to look at the evidence in a balanced way or more frighteningly be overpowered by personal prejudices and thus voting 'Guilty'. While great cinema, 12 Angry Men makes some great points about the judicial system in our democratic nations.Powerful performances from a variety of actors some unknown, great direction by Sidney Lumet and a very strong script, which is basically the backbone of this film.One of the greatest films of all time.10/10",12 Angry Men
230,higherall7,Apostles of Justice,10,19 May 2020,"This is a fascinating film with an all-star cast. There is a great spirit of ensemble here between the twelve assorted characters, and there are special moments for everyone to take away according to their own unique perspective and psychological disposition. Naturally, there are points here in this story that stand out for me.The haunted look on the face of the Hispanic youth who started out with two strikes against him, knowing he is all alone with no one to care whether he lives or dies after this third called strike, was more poignant to me than all the histrionics of the male cast in the jury room. Beatrice Straight won an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actress for five minutes and two seconds worth of work in the film NETWORK (1976). I think John Savoca should have been nominated for something for those few seconds of desperate, vulnerable, helplessness that is revealed upon his face at the start of 12 ANGRY MEN. As far as I am concerned, the expression on his face effectively sets the tone for the rest of the story in a way that volumes of words about the poor and underprivileged never could.I also like to think that Henry Fonda as Davis, never really intended such a vigorous defense of the young nameless defendant. He may or may not have planned to walk through the defendant's old neighborhood, which a juror is not supposed to do, but I'm sure it must have given him a start that he could so easily purchase the identical switchblade that was used as the murder weapon in a pawn shop. Especially as the prosecutor ably explained how it was one of a kind.After that, I am sure that Davis the architect was determined to see this case from the inside out, even if it did mean introducing new evidence, something else a juror is not supposed to do.Now anytime a lone individual decides to defy the Status Quo on a matter of principle, I'm all in; but even I could see Henry Fonda was in for a uphill battle being one man against eleven. While he slowly and methodically builds his case for reasonable doubt, he gives the defendant with no name the kind of defense he failed to receive in court. Finally, the youth is getting his proper day in court in the jury room!A couple of jurors point out to Fonda as Davis that while he may convince them all to have reasonable doubt about the youth murdering his father, there is still a chance that he is helping a murderer go scot-free. I was reminded of the O.J. Simpson trial at this point. The thought came to me still, ""Well, if he didn't do it, WHO did?"" Getting the innocent person cleared of all charges, still leaves the guilty party walking around some place. So the clouds have still parted only slightly to let in some Sun. Moreover, what if the youth runs into the real killer or somehow knows or discovers who it is?At any rate, this is a great drama when you take it on it own terms. As one reviewer noted, sex and violence are not required to carry the narrative, nor is there any reliance on profanity or nudity, which is quite a feat. You can't ask for a more thoroughly diverse cast of characters to study for motives, actions and reactions, and it's all over but the verdict before you know it.I would go through the list of all the jurors, noting that many thought Lee J. Cobb stole the show, but I invite you to make up your own mind as I did, and select your own favorites.Once again, some would consider this one of the greatest films of all time, and on this point, I find I cannot make an argument.",12 Angry Men

It's not difficult to stand out from the crowd but it's so much harder to stoop down to it everytime you're pressured into thinking, doing, believing something or behaving the way the rest is - you have to stand firmly where you are and be a human no matter what and maybe, just maybe, the angry people around you will see the whole picture more clearly.This motion picture tells us not to rush to conclusions despite how convinced we are of our rightness because there's always more than meets the eye and truly good things always take time.",12 Angry Men
236,illbebackreviews,12 Angry Men....You be the 13th Jury,10,23 November 2012,"Let me start off by saying that I've actually never seen a black and white film! Yes, its hard to believe that. But, I decided to watch this film as it was obviously one of the highest rated films and certainly the title sounded quite interesting. Without knowing anything about the movie, I went in to watch it and was stunned! The first ten to fifteen minutes just introduces you to each of the juries in the most interesting way possible. You aren't introduced to them by their names, but you are to remember them by their faces and different personalities. It started off very quietly, and I'll admit...pretty boring. However, as soon as the murder issue was brought into the movie, I felt this sudden urge to watch the movie immediately from start to finish. At this point, I was in. From here on in, its all filled with tension, friendship, loyalty, justice, truth and hatred. Its the best drama film I've ever seen, and certainly remains the greatest of the Mystery films. What really makes this film stand out as an alone success? Its pretty much the way each character is introduced. '12 Angry Men' is the only film in history, that can give you whole bunches of characters and not give out their names and yet love the characters and the story. The plot is extremely simple and not too much happens, but its the way the film is executed that really stands out. If you think about it, at the end of the film not too many events happen. Its just different juries laying out their evidence to Jury 3 (mainly) about why the boy could be innocent of the crime of murdering his father. Its not a story that shows it from the boys perspective, nor any sort of action. In fact, the whole film takes place in this jury room. Wow! Other strengths about this film are the incredible dialogue sequences and the masterful acting by each and every single one of the actors. At no point did any actor slack off, not even the old man. Speaking of the old man, he, apart from Jury 8 (the main jury) is the character I liked most. I also absolutely loved Jury 3, the one who detested the boy being innocent. The acting was masterful and his performance is also extremely powerful. I also enjoyed the man who looked a lot like Peter Cushing, the one who was 'believed' to be the first to say not guilty. He seemed great, as did the foreign jury. Pretty much every character was brilliant. '12 Angry Men', overall, is a clear example that a film does not need to contain extensive amounts of special effects but its the dialogue, the plot, the characters and the acting that makes a film a success. Also, the better executed, the better the film and this film has such strength in every one of those aspects. Directors like George Lucas, should watch movies like '12 Angry Men' as well as his original Star Wars trilogy and understand what makes a good film. Its not CGI battles (not that they could've done it back then), not the action, not the stupid love story (Anakin and Padme) and definitely not stupid slapstick humor. '12 Angry Men' is definitely the greatest black and white film I've seen and its definitely a must see for everyone and deserves a high spot in my Top 20",12 Angry Men

239,MovieGuy109,A must-see of simple filmmaking,10,25 November 2011,"12 Angry Men-****- A Masterpiece- Directed by: Sidney Lumet. Written by: Reginald Rose (from his own teleplay), Starring: Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, E.G Marshall, Martin Balsam, Jack Warden, John Fiedler, Jack Klugman, Edward Binns, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Voskovec, Robert Webber.Sidney Lumet's first film explores a murder trial from the jury room based off the teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose. Twelve men debate the fate of a Puerto Rican teenager on trial for the murder of his father. Eleven jurors think he is guilty and one (Fonda) thinks he is innocent.The amazing thing about the film is how the film pulls out emotion as well as logic in the trial. The two do not way each other out however. Lumet balances the racism and laziness of the eleven jurors with the unbiased nature of Fonda's character. Reginald Rose creates a perfect juror and an ideal protagonist while allowing Lumet to add claustrophobia and conflict to add to the film's relatively limited cinematic approach which adds to the experience of the play.Lumet's career was not always as successful as his first film and sometimes it was more powerful, but this is certainly not mediocre in any way. It makes better use of cinematic techniques in a theatrical narrative than most films like this. This also serves as one of the many high points in the career of Henry Fonda and a starting place for a number of character actors such as E.G Marshall, Ed Begley, and Jack Warden. The impact this film had on Lumet and Hollywood in general is as great as any film based off a play.",12 Angry Men

It has so much to offer and has twelve very unique individuals, they all exploded with personality.I had always wanted to see this movie, but had no idea really what it was going to be about. The title tells me its about a jury obviously, but I didn't know if it would be a trial and then a jury or what. I love how it turned out, I found no flaws in this film. I would give it a perfect 10 but that is reserved for my all-time faves.It quickly goes from the courtroom to the jury room, only showing the young defendant for a brief moment. We never hear the trial but 11 of the men come in and start off about how it is an easy verdict and the kid is guilty case closed! One man (Fonda) is not that definite, he is not saying the kid is innocent, he isn't saying he's guilty, he just thinks they should talk about it.They all get mad at Fonda but they start talking it out, we then get to hear the case via their discussions. As time passes more and more facts surface and they start to change their votes one by one. I personally was on the edge of my seat the entire time so eager for more. It really starts to show these men as individuals and we get an insight in the minds of men, not just the jurors but each man there is representing people as a whole and thats the beauty of the film. By the end of it all they are all on the not guilty side and the journey to get there is some of the best time you will ever have watching a movie.Each actor was amazing, all stand alone as separate visions of man, some younger, some older, some angry, some sad, some bitter, those who seek reason and those who place blame.The directing was great and to spend all but 3 minutes of this film in one room and keep it alive must've been a real challenge for the director. The room is somewhat big, but he had to get up close and personal with the men, and also show the viewer a sense of claustrophobia that one must feel. A fan that didn't work on a hot day and rain forcing them to close windows were beautiful touches. The large wall of windows with a tease of the outside world and most of the men bluntly stating they have some where else they need to be. It was just a beautiful film.100 percent drama, all dialog, but simply amazing to sit thru, as nice to watch as it is to listen to the arguments and reason. I can't say anything that hasn't been said about this film, I am no critic, I just love movies and few touch me and move me and entertain me as this one has.",12 Angry Men

Marshall and Jack Warden.",9,24 October 1998,"This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat as tensions spill over in a jury room. Aside from a brief seen in the beginning of the film, the entire story is told inside the jury room itself. Henry Fonda has often referred to this effort as his favorite and I could not agree more. I've seen 12 Angry Men many times since 1957 when it was first released. It is in black and white which seems to fit the film perfectly. Note the great use of close-ups used by Sidney Lumet. It is truly a classic and I strongly recommend it.",12 Angry Men
242,Sonatine97,Guilt & Justice - A Lesson to us all,9,20 June 2000,"A very good film that seems more suited to the stage. The story is simple yet concise and thought-provoking. A teenager with a history of crime behind him is charged with murdering his own father. Most of the jury, the dis-interested judge and several witnesses are all of the same mind - guilty!!Its left to one man, Number 8, (Henry Fonda) to use his liberal sense of justice & circumstance in defending the boy against impossible odds - especially when faced with one of the biggest cynics of the jury, Lee J Cobb(his best performance by far)Lumet directs with great aplomb, the routine story is given extra life by the wonderful characters who really give a tour-de-force performance, and perhaps makes us feel guilty when we decide individuals in modern society are instantly guilty based purely on their ethnicity, social standing and other inner prejudicesBut what I admired most was the camerawork. 90% of the film takes places in the juryroom where the 12 men (no women, no blacks - this was 1957!) deliberate. With a clever combination of lighting & tight camera angles you feel as if you can smell the clamminess & claustrophic atmosphere of that intense little room.A weak point could be directed at Fonda for playing the whiter-than-white liberal rising above the savage right-wingers, and to be frank I didn't rate his performance much above mediocre - for me, his best role apart from On golden Pond would be Once Upon A Time in The West!The true acting honours really go to Cobb and especially, Ed Begley, playing the racist redneck to a tee.

243,brianberta,One of the most engaging and tense movies out there,9,28 September 2015,"This debut feature is a gripping and engaging courtroom drama which is very effective. After I watched it once, I wanted to watch it again.A boy is accused of murdering his father. The twelve jurors retire to the jury room to determine whether he's innocent or guilty. Only 1 of them thinks he's not guilty and he has to persuade the other men why he thinks so.I personally found this to be extremely amazing. The movie was able to keep my attention for the whole way through. It was interesting seeing the men say counter arguments back and forth. Also, 1 of the jurors appears to be a sadist who just wants the boy to be put to death regardless of what evidence he's presented with. In my opinion, he is the best character in the movie because his acting performance makes him a very convincing character.Speaking of the acting, it was strong on all parts. As I said, Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb) gave the best performance in the movie. However, there are several more actors who did a great job as well. Jurors #8 (Henry Fonda) and #9 (Joseph Sweeney) gave exceptional performances and the other 9 jurors gave convincing performances also. I don't think that they could've given a much better performance.Also, I found the movie to be very easy to follow. It gives a brief explanation of its plot at the beginning so everyone knows what's going on right before the 12 jurors meet. Also, the movie was very well-written. The fictional murder case set up was well and it contained a lot of elaborate plot points to it which were brought up during the movie.I can see why this movie has gotten as much praise as it has now. It is one of the most engaging and tense movies I've ever seen. The tension doesn't really come from action like many other movies do. The tension comes from the arguments brought up and how the jurors behave. I just watched this movie yesterday and I already want to watch it again. So far, this is one of my favorite movies of all time and it might even had the ability to become my #1 favorite. I'll just wait and see.",12 Angry Men

There was a prior TV version, which is horrible. Lumet's version is the only one to see.",12 Angry Men
245,manendra-lodhi,A Pure Epic!!!,10,7 May 2012,There Are Some Movies which keep themselves apart from all other films. 12 Angry men is one of them. I read sometime ago about the definition of movies by alfred hitchcock as to all life drama minus the boring part. This movie clearly defines this. Filmed entirely into one room itself is an achievement for a film made so earlier. The movie helps filmmakers to think differently and not follow the established rules. How only one person is able to change the minds of people with just debates is worth watching. Looking forward to much more films like this to be made.A must watch for people with love of an impeccable script completely dependent on dialogs.,12 Angry Men
246,robertguttman,Filmed entirely in one room,10,23 April 2011,"One little-mentioned aspect of this great motion picture is that it was filmed almost entirely inside a jury room. Just consider that: in an era when movies have to rely on cars chases, explosions, CGI special effects and 3D technology, here's an absolutely riveting movie that was filmed entirely within the confines of a single room! That just goes to show what can be achieved with a great script, a great cast and a great director. Although Henry Fonda is the only real ""movie star"" in the cast, Lee J. Cobb and Ed Begley were both distinguished stage and film actors. Most of the other actors in Twelve Angry Men enjoyed long careers on stage, screen and television, mainly as character and supporting actors.",12 Angry Men
247,aleksanderk-95350,Amazing film,9,30 June 2021,Some of the best acting I have seen. Every juror has a presence in this film. The dialogue in this film is incredible. It keeps you're attention and never feels boring.,12 Angry Men
248,kyle-cruse,Arguably the great courtroom drama of all time,10,2 September 2008,"For me, it's between ""A Few Good Men"" and this for the best courtroom drama, but most likely this is it. This is not the type of film I would typically expect to even be interesting. Nearly all of the film takes place inside a single room, as one lone juror (Henry Fonda) tries to convince the other eleven that the accused party is not guilty of murder. The film is composed of nothing but dialogue, but don't let that stop you from watching it. Few films can rely this much on dialogue to keep its viewers interested the entire time. Like all great courtroom dramas, ""12 Angry Men"" is an intense film, not because it is action-packed but because we must watch twelve men make up their minds and weigh all of the evidence. It is intriguing what each of these men come to realize as they ponder for hours upon end. Not a bit boring. I can watch this film multiple times and still be fascinated by it each time. The acting is some of the most superb I have ever seen, causing the audience to feel the tension going on in the room in each scene. An absolutely perfect movie.**** out of ****",12 Angry Men
249,jfarms1956,Many talented actors,4,5 April 2013,"12 Angry men is a film in which maybe those over 25 would enjoy. It explores prejudices and preconceived notions which people had in the 1950s. Actors such as Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, Martin Balsam, Jack Klugman, Jack Warden, E.G. Marshall, and Ed Begley give good performances and make their characters believable. Without these good performances, it could have been a boring movie with meaningless discussions in the jury room and in the court room. These talented actors bring life to the movies. The movie could edit out 5-10 minutes. It is a classic so it warrants watching. Otherwise, a bit slow. The movie had a predictable outcome.Watch it alone for the performance of it best actor, Henry Fonda.",12 Angry Men
250,faraaj-1,The nature of prejudice,10,10 January 2007,"12 Angry Men is excellent! Its probably the best film in the careers of all concerned. Yes, its better than Lumet's Dog Day Afternoon, just as good as Fonda's Ox-Bow Incident, and almost equals Lee J. Cobb's The Man who Loved Cat Dancing (just kidding about Cobb!!!). This is NOT a court-room drama but instead concentrates on the jury deliberation process. We have 12 angry men - all familiar faces giving ace performances - stuck in a hot courthouse room with an out of order fan on the hottest day of the year. The humidity is killing them and they have to decide whether or not a Hispanic teen from the slums is guilty of a murder. The vote has to be unanimous or its a hung jury. Juror #8, Henry Fonda, is the only member of the jury who wants to question the evidence before sending the boy to the gallows. For the rest, including the audience. its a cut-and-dry case.In his Western classic The Ox-Bow Incident, Fonda is a bad man who over the duration of the night learns to shed his prejudice. The audiences knows he is wrong and feels relief when he makes the right choice in the end. What is interesting when comparing 12 Angry Men to Ox-Bow is how roles are reversed. Fonda is the only truly good and decent man in the jury and does not have a prejudices to shed. In fact, I as an audience member made the journey from someone convinced that the teen was guilty - based on the overwhelming evidence against him and my own hidden biases - to a person who realizes he has pigeon-holed someone into a mold which may not be accurate. The way this taut drama engrosses the viewer while raising awareness on important social issues is nowhere more evident than in the final scene at the steps of the courthouse where you really feel revitalizes after having spent a few hours in a small claustrophobic room. One of the best examples of films that can truly be said to elevate cinema to an art form, 12 Angry Men is unmissable!",12 Angry Men
251,Artimidor,Fonda casts a contagious shadow of a doubt,10,25 May 2012,"One room, twelve men and talk, talk, talk. Ninety minutes of film. Sounds like a bore, but turns out to be quite the opposite. The back room of a courthouse where a jury of ordinary men has to decide upon life and death becomes the place of first rate drama, where a seemingly insignificant shadow of a doubt makes people talk at least once more about what at first appeared to be a clear cut case. Henry Fonda with his understated play is in the lead of the doubters, supported by strong character actors like Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Jack Warden or Martin Balsam.The reluctant, some even clearly prejudiced members of the motley jury all look at the case from very different angles, but they are made real by distinguished acting and screenwriter Reginald Rose's crispy dialog, which never misses the mark. Also remarkable is the fact that the battle of the jurors is embedded in a highly believable environment - a hot day, people sweating, emotions getting the better of them, then a downpour outside, there are casual conversations about what's on people's minds in the breaks, restroom scenes which serve further character elaboration. Director Sidney Lumet on his part focuses on making the film as claustrophobic as he possibly can. He uses subtle camera tricks to gradually make the confined space even seem closer to the actors as the film progresses to add to the mounting intensity and the final shots are made from below eye level to reflect the change that has taken place. ""12 Angry Men"" above all is a captivating character study. It is not about solving a crime, but characters confronted with decision making and how they approach it. Exceptional film-making.Side note: ""12 Angry Men"" was remade in 1997 with another outstanding ensemble cast headed by Jack Lemmon. A decent film, but no reason to miss the original.",12 Angry Men

This is not because I dislike the film, but because the director makes it seem so easily done, it makes you think you could do it yourself. The acting is a complete dream. Henry Fonda, E. G. Marshall, Martin Balsam and Robert Webber are exceptional. But the real star of the film is Lee J. Cobb. He immense's himself so completely into his role that its hard to believe that the movie isn't a documentary. The ending of the film, with that look on Lee J. Cobb's face is heart rendering. Lumet's directorial debut (he had been previously in TV) is as remarkable as Orson Welle's in ""Citizen Kane"". A brilliant piece of film making.",12 Angry Men
255,RhapsodyReviews,Brilliant Film.,10,2 September 2019,"'12 Angry Men' is a drama film directed by Sidney Lumet. The film tells the story of a jury of 12 men as they deliberate the conviction or acquittal of a defendant based on reasonable doubt, forcing the jurors to question their morals and values. In the United States, a verdict in most criminal trials by jury must be unanimous. The defendant is an 18-year-old male. There are two witnesses: a lady from across the street and an old man who lives below the defendant.
This is hands down my favorite film of all time. I could watch it repeatedly and never get sick of it. It's so well crafted and damn perfect in every way. It's a classic and when they attempted to remake it in 1997 it just didn't hold up to the beauty and standard that this film laid out. It's master craft filmmaking at it's finest.
Henry Fonda is a standout in this movie, he is great! Being made in the 1950's I was very impressed with all of the acting involved with this movie, but Henry Fonda was my favorite. That is in part with the dialogue that this movie has for his character. It's so realistic and believable, and it is executed brilliantly. Every actor did a great job bringing their character to life, especially since none of them are given a name and we just know them as Jury Member 1, 2, 3 and so on.
I have nothing negative to say about this movie, which is crazy because every movie is said to have some flaws; I see none here. The acting is great, the story is entertaining and real, and the cinematography is breathtaking. The way they use long shots and move the camera steadily around the room to capture different conversation in the beginning was fantastic. Also, there is one other long take that is worth mention. It involves this older gentleman, and he is getting tired and angry that this situation is taking so long. He starts to talk about the suspects ethnicity and saying he is guilty because his kind is always guilty, and they should all be put away. He keeps talking for the course of about 3 minutes and we slowly see every other jury member stand up from the table and walk away silently and ignoring him. This scene was so powerful, one because of the dialogue, but another is because it is one long scene and you feel what the other jurors are feeling the more the man speaks, anger.
Overall, this is still my favorite movie of all time. I have never seen a movie that made me feel the way I feel every time I see it. I think this movie has something for everybody, even if you're not a fan of black and white films, I beg you to give this film a chance.",12 Angry Men

257,honorhorror,1957 is a miracle year.,10,11 April 2008,"Despite all the other great events and movies I may not know, since I was born in the 80's, I was awed by the two greatest productions of this year. The bridge on the river Kwai and 12 Angry Men. Both of them has enough power to blow you out of your mind and possibly your seat, but hopefully not your window :) This production is of course not a very big one, not involving any CGI or action sequences. But, it just proved again a movie should essentially be justified by its story, not the visual effects, unless you can make all the visual effects a part of the movie, which will not be discussed here. 12 Angry Men is, to my surprise, not really a ""court"" movie, but instead, a jury room movie. 99% of the story was told in the same room, showing 12 men talking with each other in probably the real time. When I realized this, I was fearing the next 90 minutes could be a boring torture. But I was sooooo wrong.The interactions of all the characters are simply awesome. Henry Fonda is not less and not more than what he intends to be--a good guy. Thruogh the 90 minutes all he was doing was to bring justice and truth back to the eyes of jury, I was surprised by how advanced the director's cinematographic and editing were. The atmosphere of the jury room got more and more intense and it seemed the truth and righteousness was being enforced by some unseen hands. people may become stubborn, some of the jury even was so negligent that they never really cared about the death and life of the accused. But, this is still not the concentration of the movie. The movie, is a 1 and a half hours miracle about fate being changed, not about stubborn people's mind being changed.Simply brilliant. And truly meaningful. The movie inspires people in many ways, including being a good man, which is most wanted in this century, I mean the 21st century.10/10.",12 Angry Men
258,sb-47-608737,Brilliant Group dynamics,10,25 February 2017,"I will not go in normal review of the movie. It had been brilliant. There were loopholes, but not in the plot, but in the prosecution. There are more than reasonable doubt of the boy being not guilty and he most certainly was, along with the points made by the defense (jurors) there were several other missed points, which the stories said, but weren't used for defense. The movie brilliantly brings out, when the cops wants to make a scapegoat of someone who doesn't have means to defend, how easily they can. The defense lawyer, as mentioned during discussions, was an unwilling completely disinterested and somehow wanted to go over the ordeal. Probably a case of 'Court Appointed' - a la ""You volunteer"" of An Officer And A gentleman. The glaring inconsistencies, which the juror noticed, and some they didn't were not noticed by him. However that isn't the brilliance of the movie, but it is its real life depiction of a upper echelon policy meeting, especially Board Meetings of a company. I am in a position vouch for that. Probably, if not already, this movie should be a part of mandatory curriculum of any business school. There the CEO has brought an agenda, ably supported by his/her team (the prosecutors). It is in Board, and usually the way it happens, all are very convinced of the power point presentation and the golden future the schemes will lead to. Unless one has a doubt and express it, the scheme will move on, till probably it is too late (boy past and beyond chair). It is only when one says ""I am not too sure"" the discussions take place and various lacunae and wrong assumptions come to surface. In business, those are taken (sometimes) positively to plug the loopholes and polish the proposal (here of course there were no midway) but still the dynamics of a business meeting was replicated. The members with their own personal opinions (back grounds, prejudices), changing courts, on one side and again on other side, as the respective prejudices were addressed by the two opposing camps. Though all the background of each were not clearly brought out, but still one could guess, from their prejudices. Change the topic, and as I said it is a board meet.On the lighter side. this movie is strangely devoid of feminine presence. In the whole movie, leave aside jurors, there are not a single member of the fair gender credited or un-credited. In fact only two women ever get referred to, first being one of the star witnesses and the other one of the juror's wife.",12 Angry Men
259,kurosawakira,Fireworks From Start to Finish,9,9 February 2013,"There's some wonderful acting in Welles' ""Touch of Evil"" (1958), especially between Heston and Welles. There the characters don't duly wait for space to say their lines, they're impatient, try to cut into the conversation and steal that moment or two in the flow of conversation they know they won't be granted otherwise.In this film Lumet goes as far one can go in this respect. The characters are no longer characterizations, they're real people, interacting with passion, conscious of their space not only in the room but in the conversational dimension, just like we are in real life.The cinematography corresponds to this intimacy. The air is full of emotion, presence. I often consider Dreyer's ""La passion de Jeanne d'Arc"" (1928) as the ultimate close-up, but it might as well be this one. I have never felt having been transported to a place with such frenetic control, oxymoronically speaking. This is fireworks from start to finish. Then again, the cinematographer is one of the great masters of cinema. Consider that this is the man who shot all those amazing interiors in Vigo's ""L'Atalante"" (1934), it's not entirely shocking that there's so many visually preternatural things transpiring. Moreover, here one may find the crème de la crème of any version of Sherlock Holmes ever made, a whodunit in which logic is overturned by logic, emotion by emotion, recollection by clarity. A wonderfully executed study of thought guided by prejudice and assumption and of thought guided by passion for lucidity. The Region A Blu-ray released by the Criterion Collection is great not only for having impeccable image quality but also for the brilliant extra material.",12 Angry Men

And a brilliant masterpiece indeed! It is certainly not an easy task to make a movie like that with the same fixed setting. Probably this movie is smart enough to make up the number of characters to at least 12 men to make up for the rich details.

263,Semisonic,An ever-timely call to the human conscience,9,6 August 2016,"No matter how prejudiced, preoccupied or plain angry you are, there's always a reason to slow down, step back and take a second look at things that seem obvious on the surface. That's basically the message of 12 Angry Men.It's been more than 50 years since this film was released, and obviously the rules of cinematography have changed since then. Now such theatrical films may feel somewhat odd or staged, and, indeed, 12 Angry Men is more of a play than a film. However, it's a rare occasion when the pure idea professed by a film becomes a manifesto that goes beyond a particular epoch or style, acquiring that kind of topicality that lives forever as long as there is a mankind.There's no point describing the events of the film, for they only serve as a means of delivering the film's message and call to our conscience, waking it up from the heavy dreams of our compromise-ridden lives. But it's the actors' work that turns the slow-paced narrative into a vivid showcase of emotions and characters. And even though Henry Fonda is the only big star of the cast, I can't say that the job is done by him alone. On the contrary, it's the men his characters confronts that really give the stage enough diversity and naturalness to feel real and true.The expected happy ending of the film doesn't really chime in with the gloomy cinema trends of the modern cinema. However, the hope that it brings has a deep symbolic meaning. 12 Angry Men isn't about opposing good and evil people. It doesn't divide us, instead, it tries telling us that, despite how we look and act right now, there's something good and honest and kind in all of us, and the future of this world, represented in this film by the life of a young boy tried for murder, depends on our ability to stay true to those sides of ours and find them within, however muddied they might be. Each of those twelve jurors had certain principles that he was ready to put above his personal fancy. And I can only hope that in the world of today our own anger, vanity or indifference are still not strong enough to make us lose our light completely.",12 Angry Men

Look closer and you will find that Sidney Lumet's debut turn as a director is an exemplary study in characterization and a crash course in pure filmmaking.Most of the action takes place within the confines of a single room on what is supposedly ""the hottest day of the year"". A jury made up of 12 men has to decide the fate of a teenage boy who is accused of a gruesome murder. The defendant has everything going against him - a couple of witnesses, a murder weapon, a sloppy public attorney and the fact that he is from a less privileged class of the society. Over the next 95 minutes, 12 Angry Man watches as 11 jurors, first convinced of the suspect's guilt overcome their less than democratic prejudices and are slowly won over to the side of reasonable doubt by one man's doubts about the accused's guilt.Sidney Lumet creates energy and movement through quick editing and varying camera angles, which makes the film pulse with power and emotion despite its one set location. Operating within the constrictions of a limited budget, Lumet tightens the noose by accentuating the excruciating pulse of the ceiling fan and slowly narrowing his shots on his characters as the film approaches its climax. A special mention should be made here of ace cameraman Boris Kaufman, who ratchets up the claustrophobia with every close-up and ably heightens the drama, despite the confining setting. The actors – all 12 of them – are top notch as the '12 Angry Men' in what is to date one of the best ensemble casts to have graced the silver screen.The drama plays out at an engaging pace making this brilliant war of words an entrancing cinematic experience. Lumet gives us an incisive and gripping film that is as relevant today as it was almost 60 years back. If you love movies, you owe it to yourself to see this one!",12 Angry Men
269,mohit_sinsniwal,Excellent work by everyone,9,26 May 2019,"An excellent courtroom drama with a unique twist. Instead of following the trial itself, the viewer has a unique chance to observe the events behind the closed doors of a jury room. The film begins with the end of the trial. The jurors retire to deliberate the case. A preliminary vote is taken and the result is 11:1 in favour of the guilty verdict. Eleven jurors have raised their hands to convict a young man of killing his father. Only Juror #8 has doubts. At first even he does not truly believe the young man to be innocent but notes (rightfully) that the case for the defence might have been presented in a more convincing manner and that the boy might be given the benefit of a doubt. Since the boy is to be executed if found guilty his life is now in the hands of the jury and juror #8 reasons that the least they could do is talk about the case a bit. As time goes on some of the jurors change their minds and find that there is perhaps enough reasonable doubt not to convict the young man after all. But not everyone is easy to convince.Although the plot of the film is excellent and it is fascinating to see what little things can influence which way a verdict goes, where this film really succeeds is in presenting the characters of the 12 jurors. The character of each of the jurors emerges through a wonderful mix of perfect casting, excellent dialogue and near-flawless acting.Juror #1 - a simple man who clearly does not understand the full complexity of the task that lies before him but is trying to do everything not to let anyone else find this out. He appears at ease only once during the film - when he talks about football. He has the misfortune to be selected foreman of the jury - a task he clearly does not relish.Juror #2 - a small, quite man, clearly unaccustomed to giving his own opinion much less to expecting his views to be of any importance. Apparently he finds solace in his job - he is an accountant.Juror #3 - probably the most complex personality in the film. Starts off like a pleasant self-made successful businessman, he analyses the case impartially, explains his arguments well and is reasonably self assured. As time goes on he becomes more and more passionate and seems to be somehow personally involved with the case. He also starts to show some signs of slight mental instability. Wonderfully played by Lee J. Cobb - this is the character you remember after the film is over.Juror #4 - self assured, slightly arrogant stockbroker. Obviously considers himself more intelligent than anyone else in the room, he approaches the case with cool heartless logic but (as one of the jurors says - ""this is not an exact science"") he does not take into account the feelings, the passions, the characters of the people involved in the case. He is conspicuous by the fact that he is the only juror that does not take his jacket off (it is a very hot day).Juror #5 - here is a man under great emotional stress. He comes from the same social background as the accused boy - with who he almost unwillingly seems to identify with. Paradoxically this appears one of the main reasons for him voting guilty - he does not want compassion to influence him - so ironically it does.Juror #6 - a simple man, quite readily admitting that everyone in the room is better qualified than he is to make decisions and offer explanations. But he really wants to see justice done and it worries him that he might make a mistake.Juror #7 - the only one that really has no opinion on this case. Literally throughout the film his thoughts are never on the case - he talks of baseball, of the heat, of fixing the fan but the only reason he has for voting this way or that is to speed things up a bit so he might be out of the jury room as soon as possible. Not an evil man he just has no sense of morality whatsoever - he can tell right from wrong but does not seem to think it's worth the bother.Juror #8- a caring man, has put more thought into the case than any of the other jurors. He tries to do his best even in the face of seemingly impossible odds.Juror #9 - a wise old man with his great life experience has quite a unique way of looking at the case.Juror #10 - the most horrifying character in the film. Votes guilty and does not even try to hide the fact that he does so only because of the boy's social background. The tragedy comes from the fact that his own social position is only a cut above the boy's - which makes him all the more eager to accentuate the difference.Juror #11 - an immigrant watchmaker, careful methodical man, well mannered and soft spoken. respects the right of people to have different opinion to his - and is willing to look at both sides of the problem. Loses his temper only once - horrified by the complete indifference of juror #7.Juror #12 - a young business type - perhaps he has his own opinions - but is careful to hide them. What he has learnt out of life seems to be that intelligence is equal with agreeing with what the majority of people think.The film succeeds in doing something very rare today - developing an intelligent plot while also developing 12 believable, memorable and distinct characters.",12 Angry Men
270,dkncd,Reasonable doubt,10,14 August 2007,"""12 Angry Men"" is about a jury of 12 men voting on a death sentence case. Eleven of the men see it as an open and shut case with a clear verdict of guilty. However, one of the men thinks there is reasonable doubt.The majority of the film takes place in the deliberation room with the 12 men discussing the case. Even though the film takes place mostly in this single room and is singularly focused on the 12 men discussing the case, the film is never tedious. On the contrary, while a lot of films have slower moments, this one is gripping from start to finish.Each of the 12 performances is strong and each of the 12 jurors' characters is well-developed and adds to the film. Henry Fonda is inspiring as the one man who believes there is cause for reasonable doubt. ""12 Angry Men"" is a triumph of minimalist filming and highly recommended.",12 Angry Men

Jurors smoke cigarettes throughout the movie. Biased jurors state as a ""fact"" that minorities drink too much alcohol. There is one ""damn."" A young man is accused of stabbing his father to death. Jurors nearly come to blows over disagreements about the case. One juror threatens to kill another in the heat of the moment. The fact that this jury is made up exclusively of white males should be explained to kids as a sign of the film's time period.

The story is gripping, revolving around a murder trial of a Latino boy accused of killing his father and the twelve men who will decide his faith. The cast does a great job with the portrayal of the various jurors and the complex reasons they lean to one verdict or the other presenting us with twelve massively different characters each with his own flaws and his own views of morality and human nature.

279,cosmorados,You're not really going to kill me are you?,9,17 June 2008,"This is one of those great films that, at the time it is made, tackles a difficult subject, but does so in such a way that it becomes that subject's definitive movie reference point.The story focuses on a young boy who is charged with murdering his father. Given a public defender as he cannot afford legal counsel, the case seems to be open and shut. He didn't know the films he saw on the night he was supposed to be at the pictures, he had bought the knife that was similar to the one that killed his father, he was experienced in using a knife and 2 witnesses saw him kill his father and flee the scene. Chances of mistakes, well, let's face it none. He'll be found guilty and as it is murder he will go to the electric chair.In Sidney Lumet's supreme drama 12 men hold the fate of this boy in their hands and within a claustrophobic room on a hot summers day the discussions that take place are more gripping than a hell of a lot of bland action films who rely on special effects rather then script, storytelling or performance. The acting within this drama is superb and Henry Fonda is magic as Juror number 8 who has some doubt as to the guilt of the accused. Everyone in the room is superb in their role, with a special nod to Jack Klugman as the guy from a poor background who knows the kind of area the kid comes from, Joseph Sweeney as the shrewd eyed Juror number 9 is also fantastic, but for me E.G.Marshall and Lee J. Cobb (Arguably the most underrated American character actor) are magnificent in their roles as Juror's 4 and 3, the clever juror who takes careful consideration of the evidence and Lee J, consumed by anger over his own child's independence and taking that out in the jury room.It is a fine film that has stayed the test of time that, although some of our current generation may find stagy and un-dynamic, is still as appealing as ever for a generation who enjoy having the cinema do some thinking with them about our world, and not necessarily for them.",12 Angry Men

282,thinbeach,"6/10, a hung jury",6,2 July 2019,"It feels like a stage play adapted for screen, an interesting story told in real time, with little more than a boardroom setting. A jury debate the fate of a young man accused of murdering his father. It looks to be a cut and dry guilty verdict, but the vote returned, 11-1, is not unanimous, and the lone voice in favour of 'not guilty' spends the rest of the film convincing the others he is right. It highlights the complexities and serendipity of the justice system (in particular the death sentence), and the personal sentiments clouding decisions, and for such a mundane setting, the case remains compelling. Unfortunately it is very contrived. The jury, who have no training in law, appear to make a better case in an hour and a half than the lawyers did in many days. We are supposed to believe its because the lawyers weren't interested in the case. Right. The real answer is because we wouldn't have a movie if they did.

Or it may be Henry Fonda, who having seen the play on TV insisted on a feature film, raised the money and chose the cast. The claustrophobia associated with stage to screen adaptations works to this film's advantage. Spectacle is offered in the two-shot, three-shot, CUs and ECUS by topnotch DP Boris Kaufman and rival John Ford's Monument Valley westerns or Cecil B. DeMille's Biblical miracles. The casting, characterizations, dialogue and pacing are perfect and this movie is as suspenseful as any ever made. Powerful themes are underscored by powerful performances. Knowing the ending spoils nothing.",12 Angry Men
285,Lucabrasisleeps,A Classic movie which lives up to its reputation,10,27 November 2008,"12 angry men must be one of the most unpretentious classics ever. The reason I say this is because most classics either have a reputation for being long epics about war and love (ala Gone with the wind) or for being slow moving movies which may not be accessible to all (ala Citizen Kane). But this one was different. It is a movie about 12 jurors who meet to decide a young man's fate. The whole movie is shot in the same building and mostly in one room. And it deals with human nature and how people behave when in a group. These are universal themes that anybody can relate to. The style is also very simple with no unnecessary complications or flashy camera-work.12 jurors are now required to take a tough decision - to decide about the guilt of a young 18 year old boy. If found guilty, he would be put to death. At the beginning, most jurors are in agreement over his guilt except for one of them. That is Juror no.8 (Played by Henry Fonda). One of the jurors then gives an opinion that the rest of the jurors should try to justify their decision to juror no.8. The arguments go back and forth till the end. These exchanges are very interesting because of the emotional nature of the discussions.Most of the jurors have set opinions on social issues and these are exposed during the discussions. Objectivity is in short supply and juror no.4, a stockbroker is notable in his objective analysis. Juror no.11 (played by George Voskovec) is also notable for his detailed analysis and opinions on the case. Juror no.7 is noticeably disinterested in discussing the case as he has already made up his mind over the guilt of the accused. He, in fact, is more interested in the baseball game in the same night and in cracking jokes when serious discussions are in progress. I did laugh at most of them. One of them, about a hair-splitters convention, was especially hilarious! Juror no.3 is one of the jurors who are convinced about the boy's guilt. He becomes too emotionally involved with the case and details and at one time even moves to punch Juror no.8 before he is held back by others.Juror no.2 is usually timid but gives valid arguments when asked for his opinion. His exchanges are also sometimes quite funny! Juror no.5 is another person whose opinions are clouded because of his past perceptions and opinions. Juror no.1 is a man who tries to direct the group and he does his best to break up unnecessary arguments. Juror no.12 is an advertising executive who is quite self assured and confident at the beginning but then becomes doubtful about his opinions on the case. He sways back and forth based on the evidence presented and the arguments laid on the table. He tries to crack jokes and often the others don't find it very amusing. But once he makes an off the cuff remark and most of the jurors find it funny. It is scenes like these and the attention to detail that make the movie special. Juror no.9 is an old man who has lots of life experiences and speaks on the basis of that regarding the case. He also brings up some very good points especially one towards the end.Henry Fonda is obviously the center of attention. With his kind eyes and his screen presence, he is definitely the pick of the actors. Jack Warden(Juror no.7), with his great sense of humour and easy natural acting style, is one of my personal favourites. It is quite unusual for a fifties film. Lee Cobb's performance as Juror no.3 was the most emotionally charged role in the whole movie and he has given a powerful performance that at times gave me goosebumps. This is one of the best acting performances on film. George Voskovec as Juror no.11, the immigrant watchmaker, is also quite good and he is especially good in the scene where he confronts Jack warden about his decision. That scene is my favorite in the film. E G Marshall as the stockbroker, juror no.4, gives an excellent performance as the impassive and objective man who gives his opinions in a detached manner without any emotional connection whatsoever. The others are also great in their respective roles.I didn't expect to like this movie based on the premise but instead I loved this movie and it has become one of my favourites. This movie has great replay value and this is because of the great performances and the smooth screenplay which doesn't have one unnecessary scene which might drag the movie. This is one of the classics that might appeal to a large majority of people unless they get turned off by the premise itself. This is Sydney Lumet's masterpiece and it is such an original idea that it deserves to be placed as one of the great classics of cinema.10/10",12 Angry Men

You'll recognize many of the actors, including a young Jack Klugman and a young Jack Warden. Lee J. Cobb is brilliant, and his passion as an actor once again shines in this performance.

Cliches all, even back in 1957.Yet, the cast is so real.  These are real, sweaty, down-to-earth actors putting on the performances of their lives.

I also find this movie eerily reflective of current characters/personalities in today's political landscape.

This movie is really quite incredible in what it has accomplished. A lesson to take away from this to apply to today's politics would be to settle down, lay aside your pre conceived notions and listen to what others have to say. If you disagree, bring it up respectfully and be open to their responses. Use your head. As you can see from this film, and life, this is the only way to change ones mind.I will offer one bit of criticism- they SHOULD NOT have shown the kid on trial in the beginning of the movie. They should have left it to the imagination of the viewer. I think it would have been more impactful, because it isn't about this one kids story it's a story about many people in reality.

Despite its singular location, the narrative of the film is always intriguing and you are constantly weighing in on your own opinions whether the convicted boy is guilty or not (which is never made truly clear, in a stylistic fashion).The acting is fantastic, lots of famous faces to be found here, and you really feel like you are put in these character's shoes during the course of the film.The choice to never make a cut is an experimental but highly fitting choice in this kind of tale, and has only been mastered by a few.As always, Lumet nails it, and this might very likely be his best work, as well as one of the best movies of all time, attesting to its spot on IMDb's Top 250 list.",12 Angry Men

296,StevenKeys,12 Angry Men,5,30 April 2020,"Rose - Lumet's high theater on attitudes that often bedevil jury deliberation: Sloth (J7) and prejudice (10) are well-known, but also bias (Fonda (8) acting as defense co-counsel in creating unreasonable doubts and effectively stopping his co-jurors from further reflection to push the group-think as Cobb (3) had done earlier) and the struggle all jurors should engage by being objective while ultimately forming a conviction.The men first appear, eleven, anyway, too quick to convict, then fall like dominos, too easy to acquit, running hot or cold, acceding to whichever advocate (J3 or 8) has his air-of-authority turned on high. It's a trying watch in grade below Lumet's 1982 gem, The-Verdict (wtih jurors Warden & Binns), that opens with a mawkish camera pan to beg our sympathy for a defendant of whom we know nothing, and ends by leaving the impartial viewer feeling that maybe justice was not done after-all. But there's plenty of passion with the power to make us think, and that's always a plus.And it's worth keeping this in mind when watching and being moved to-and-fro by the passions at play: It's fair to judge the personalities of the 12 jurors, to a point, and the workings of their deliberations, but their value as such and any vote they render either early or late in the process is completely within their own purview as they in the story sat through the trial and we the viewers did not, excepting the judge's flat closing instruction. It might then be wise to not vest heavily on the guilt question (2.5/4).",12 Angry Men
297,jazzest,Intense Psychological Drama with Faith and Doubt to the Jury System,6,30 May 2004,"(Possible Spoilers Included)In this acclaimed classic courtroom film, a simple one-room setting creates an unbelievably intense psychological drama. The screenplay takes full advantage of the jury system; 12 jurors' personalities are incredibly diverse (though to the contemporary audience they are too homogeneous regarding race and gender); tugs-of-war among them take place in various forms (such as one-on-one, a group vs. a group, and one vs. the rest); and the group dynamics keep changing (e.g., a person on one side comes to be on the other). The process that one juror's initiation upsets the presupposed verdict suggests that the filmmakers have both faith and doubt to the jury system. Without the system, one judge's decision would never be based on anything similar to 12 jurors' varied perspectives, which in the film's case lead the verdict of not guilty. At the same time, the film portrays the arbitrary nature of the system; nothing but a chance brings Henry Fonda's Juror #8, who is the only one to believe the defendant is innocent at the beginning, to the jury.",12 Angry Men
298,wandereramor,Insert verdict joke here,10,30 May 2012,"12 Angry Men is at the same time a very conventional and a very innovative film. It's a classic social drama, one of those dour black-and-white movies where men in suits talk about Serious Issues, and that can be very off-putting to a modern audience. But at the same time there's a lot of interesting, subversive stuff going on below the surface.For starters, there's the format. 12 Angry Men is what's known in television as a ""bubble episode"" -- it takes place almost entirely within one room, with the only action being dialogue between the characters. And this totally works. The movie never becomes dull, even for a member of my attention-span-deprived generation. Moreover, our isolation as viewers mirrors the jury's own isolation. The only facts we know are the ones we overhear, which puts us in the same position as these men. Of course, all this could fall apart without good acting, but the mostly (at least now) unknown cast pulls through and does an admirable job.What's most striking about the film is the uncertainty it leaves us in. Unlike in TV lawyer shows, there's never a smoking gun that says that the client is innocent or someone else did it. All that 12 Angry Men introduces is doubt: our eyes, our ears, the testimony of others, all can deceive us, so determining the truth becomes an impossible. The film reveals the absurdity of the American justice system, which puts so much stock in not just frail human perception but also the biases and pettiness of ordinary people. In the end the accused goes free not because he is innocent (that remains undetermined) but because Henry Fonda's character is very persuasive, and another guy wants to get out early to go to the ball game.Of course, you could also read this as an affirmation of the justice system. The jury is presented with a stack of convincing evidence, but through argument, is eventually able to come to the right conclusion. That's what makes this film so interesting: it's ambiguous to the point of paradox, being simultaneously a range of opposite things. I don't buy the idea that all great art is ambiguous like this, but in this case it's certainly true.",12 Angry Men

300,piratecannon,"Racism, Bigotry, and Stereotypes, Oh My",10,26 December 2012,"I know what you're thinking: how in the heck did you just now get around to seeing 12 Angry Men? To be honest, I don't really have a good excuse. Maybe I just got too caught up with another film with ""12″ (Monkeys) in the title.Regardless, I feel ashamed for having waited so long to take this one in. In short, this movie is absolutely brilliant. This isn't a revelation not already proclaimed by a thousand other critics, but I think it's worth noting for the simple fact that contemporary viewers (who might find themselves in my situation and realize they've postponed this for far too long) really owe it to themselves to embrace this multi-layered masterpiece that's just as relevant today as it was 54 years ago.The plot is deceptively simple: twelve jurors must decide the fate of an eighteen year-old on trial for the supposed murder of his father. Everyone on the jury is a male, and they're all fleshed out with nuanced detail. In fact, considering the entire thing takes place in a sweltering deliberation room, it's absolutely astonishing that director Sidney Lumet is able to concoct such a striking character piece that has a lot to say about the presumptions of society (again, both then and now). This, of course, it what makes 12 Angry Men the timeless piece of art that it is.But let's not ignore the flawless acting on display by everyone involved. Whether it's Henry Fonda trying to prove that nothing is ever certain or Lee Cobb bringing a father riddled with guilt to a violent and emotionally draining climax, it's all superb. The directing is clean and efficient, too—this, among other things, gives said actors a chance to fully embody their personalities and draw the audience into a drama that's anything but black and white.It's clear that screenwriter Reginald Rose has a firm grasp on how to effectively use setting, too. As the mood and opinion shifts in the cramped room, so does the bipolar weather just outside the stubborn windows.I don't know what else to say. If you're like me and have a list of certified ""classics"" that you're just now getting around to, trust me when I say that this one should be vaulted straight to the top. Give it a minute or so to get going, and you'll find yourself glued to one of the most engrossing dramas I've ever seen.",12 Angry Men
301,Richard_Alex_Jenkins,Another Not-So-Angry Convert,10,10 April 2013,"I decided to give it a few days after watching this film before writing my review, including enough time to watch several other top-rated films from this time period just to get some further perspective.The film was simply fantastic, an absolute intellectual orgasm. Never did I dream it possible that a film over 50 years old could make me physically jump out of my chair, leaping and punching the air with glee, after the end credits rolled. I felt an enormous sense of justification in taking the time to watch this very old film.At the beginning of the film we're presented with 12 indistinct men of no-particular defining characteristics, but by the end of the film we can clearly recall the decisions and personalities of each individual and how they arrived at their conclusions.Except for very brief opening and ending scenes, the entire film takes place in a single room with nothing else going for it other than the script, acting and camera work. It made me refocus on what film really is; a visual story presented to us by a film-making crew and various actors, but in modern times, sometimes consisting of a much weaker script clouded by heaps of visual effects and the use of technology.You've really got to see this film to understand why it's so good, currently rated no.6 of all-time on IMDb for a very good reason.I'd like to delve deeper into the jury's decision, but I can't, without adding spoilers to my modest review. I'll leave it at that then. Reward your intellect by giving this master work a chance to unfold.",12 Angry Men
302,K-Slicer,Always watch the classics!,10,31 July 2003,"I haven't seen too many classics in my time and I am particularly fond of this one. When it comes to the justice system and political jousting, this is probably the best movie ever made. Jury deliberations are always held out of public view and it was interesting to see how they could possibly go. Granted that this movie is a work of fiction, I found it to be one of the most realistic films of all time as well.  This is a dramatic legal classic and I can see where Scott Turow and John Grisham got some inspiration for their respective career choices maybe.Here are my reasons (some spoilers may be revealed): (1) The performance of Henry Fonda anchored this rather extraordinary piece of celluloid. It was one of the first film roles that really preached political correctness and it was done with both levelheadedness and style. At the time, Fonda took on the underdog character in a completely new and different way and that made it the best performance in the movie. (2) This was a movie filled with a lot of excellent performances and the next best one goes to E. G. Marshall.  To me, he was the actual conservative of the movie (sorry Mr. Cobb).  His views were exactly opposite of Fonda but he kept a sound mind. He logically challenged Fonda at every turn but he never lost his cool.  While Ed Begley and Lee J. Cobb played the ""conservative"" roles (more like fascist bigots in my opinion), Marshall kept his emotions in check and kept with the cold logic (much like Fonda) and that is why I found his performance to fit the bill of true conservative. (3) Another great performance was done by Joseph Sweeney. He proved that old men know their stuff. He reminded me of my maternal grandfather who is a very learned and observant man himself. Sweeney definitely stole a few scenes from both Fonda and Marshall. He definitely should have been nominated for a supporting actor Oscar. (4) Keeping with the same logic, I really liked George Voskovec. He provided the outside perspective in the movie. The tense scene he had with Jack Warden was the most emotional moment in the film next to Lee J. Cobb's breakdown before the end of the film. Granted the nationality of his character was unknown, it goes to show that people of all ethnicities share the liberal views on very tenuous issues. (5) The fifth best performance goes to the man who played Quincy for seven seasons on the show of the same name. What made him stand out was the fact that he didn't vote not guilty right away even though he was a slum survivor like the defendant in the murder trial. That is a point that those of the same background will always feel sorry for one another. That role was put into the movie to reinforce the sense of reality that the movie was trying to portray. (6) Even though I haven't seen a lot of his films, I found Sidney Lumet's direction of ""12 Angry Men"" to be Oscar worthy. He definitely cared about this movie and it was maybe the best film he ever had the chance to helm. (7) This movie was spectacularly well-written. Some of the scenarios couldn't have come about without a great writer to do it. Reginald Rose did a great job in coming up with an excellent screenplay and an excellent set of circumstances to play around with. His talent is evident with the fact that the old man pointed out the last fact and the leader of the non-guilty side didn't. (8) The cinematography made me feel the heated claustrophobia that the jurors were suffering through. Throw in a few lighting switches and a small change in dramatic effects and you have an emotionally-charged picture. I was really intrigued by the close-ups on some of the actors. You could really sense the raw emotion all those men felt as they debated away on such a weighty decision. It was beyond words at some moments. (9) This truly was a summer movie. The heat coming into a confined space and the rain coming down at night signaled this thought. I am not a big fan of typical popcorn films and I believe this a needed reprieve from that. I watched this film during a summer thunderstorm and I had to smile at the poetry behind it. It will make anyone blink a couple of times. (10) Not only is this a summer film, it is a time capsule film. Nowadays, no one could get away with making a film about a jury filled with only white men. Men and women from all standings would have to be thrown into the mix to satiate the public and the hounds of political correctness (aka most of Hollywood anyway). I wasn't offended by this movie at all even though it lacked politcal correctness in terms of the times we currently live on. At that time, it was legally acceptable to do as such and the times eventually change. This film captures the late fifties' mentality on the legal system, political correctness, and class struggle perfectly. Ten reasons give this movie a score of ten.Overall, I found ""12 Angry Men"" to be a classic that everyone from all walks of life should watch. Not only does hit hard on the times in which it took place, it makes a lot of good points on the unfairness of the legal system and fallability of mankind. All sorts of political opinions and logical paths were followed but it was easy to understand and it made ""12 Angry Men"" all the better. It should not be missed! Here ends my rant!",12 Angry Men

304,marbleann,Great Movie!!!,10,19 April 2004,"12 Angry Men is a good example of ""Less being better"". ""SPOILERS AHEAD! I have seen this movie a million times and every time I see it I notice something that I never noticed before.  I just saw it again on SHO direct and for the first time I noticed a woman on the screen.  She is walking very slowly in front of the court house in the last shot.  Even though the movie was essentially shot in one room, I wasn't wanting for other scenery. Something that happens to me while I look at one room movies.  The movie is about 12 jurors who decide the fate of a 18 year old kid who is accused of knifing his father to death.  Listening to the jurors you get the idea that this kid has had a lot of problems in his life and he is either a Puerto Rican or some other type of latino and poor.  I say PR because this is NYC in the 50's.  And some jurors refer to him as ""those people"".  We get to see people who seem like normal folks coming out about their hatred about poor ethnic people. We have a man who for some reason is using the defendant for his own agenda.  We find out later it has something to do with his son.  We have a juror who is so worried about a baseball game he is willing to go along with other jurors so he can go to the game.  There is a ad exec who is a idiot and a stockbroker that is uptight.  I think this really is accurate about what type of people get on a jury.  What I also thought was interesting is how the witnesses stories was refuted.  I don't think the witness's meant any malice but they wanted attention or to be important and they taylored their story for that affect. It also touched upon how bad a poor persons lawyer could be.  If it was not for Henry Fonda and the John Sweeney character  that kid would of been toast.  The jurors also wanted to throw in the towel very quickly.  The scary part is this.  I have heard that many times there is a lone juror who wants to talk it out but because this person is alone they get intimidated by the other jurors and they back down. In this movie these jurors even accuse the Jack Klugman character of changing his vote because he is said to be like ""those people"".  This happens in real life especially if the defendant is a minority and there is only one of that minority on the jury. If a Asian is a defendant and there is one Asian on the jury they are made to feel they better go with the other jurors even though they might feel the other way.  Mr Lumet was not just making this stuff up.  The remake was OK but why did they have to remake it? In the remake they changed the racial makeup but there were no women on the jury!!  HUH!  This is one of my favorite movies of all time.",12 Angry Men
305,marxsarx,As fresh and gripping the third time as it was the first!,9,15 February 2003,"Can a film about 12 men sitting in a jury room deliberating the fate of one young man accused of murder be as exciting as any action film you've ever seen?  Maybe!  This movie takes place almost entirely in one room, but there is more going on in that room than you'd ever believe.  This film fascinated me from beginning to end.  I've seen it three times recently and it seemed just as fresh and gripping the third time as it did the first. What makes this movie so great?  First of all, the script and the characters are intricate and well developed. Second of all, the acting from the ensemble cast is uniformly riveting.  Third, the camera work in this film is the best you'll ever see anywhere.  Fourth, the movie has something to say about about prejudice and justice without being preachy.  It simply is on a search for truth. For my money, this is one of the finest dramas ever made.  Henry Fonda is right on target as the architect who has reasonable doubts.  Each of the other 11 actors give stellar performances of unique men who open up like books as the story proceeds. You'll be thinking about this movie long after the jury has reached a verdict.  This movie is as relevant today as it was 45 years ago.  Don't miss it.  I give it a 94/100!",12 Angry Men

307,Hawkensian,'12 Angry Men' is a true timeless classic,9,6 March 2013,"The film examines prejudice and the sheer callousness of human behaviour, issues which will forever be relevant. At the beginning, 11 out of the 12 jurors are happy to see the accused, an 18-year-old Latino from the slums, be executed by the state. Initially this seems unremarkable, you assume that they all have good reasons for their verdict. However it's soon apparent that most of the jurors have just glossed over the facts, reaching their damning conclusion because they 'just think he's guilty' – there's even one juror who can't wait to leave the room so he can go to a baseball game. Only Juror #8 (Henry Fonda) is disturbed by the hastiness of it all; he doesn't know whether the kid is guilty, he just wants to at least talk about it before the jury so swiftly condemns him to death. I've praised films such as 'Killer Joe' for their success in engrossing its audience despite much of its story occurring in very few locations. However, compared to '12 Angry Men', 'Killer Joe' is a veritable action adventure - this legal drama never leaves the jury room. Its success in gripping its audience and fully involving them in the characters and plot is a masterful achievement of writer Reginald Rose.At the table sits a spectrum of personalities, all of whom you can identify and resonate with. Some are measured, some are fickle, some are blinkered and one or two are downright pig-headed and obnoxious. The natural, timeless performances allow you to cross-examine them; they are all personalities one has come across before, and the viewer can probably draw parallels with people they know - this is one of the film's core strengths. Sidney Lumet's debut feature is to be lauded for its reserve and lack of sensationalism. There may be those who doubt the credibility of some of the case developments, but to my relief, I personally found few if no traces of hyperbole or implausibility. '12 Angry Men' is a film I truly admire, a timeless classic that deserves the attention of all generations – it will continue to live on as many of its contemporaries continue to date.www.hawkensian.com",12 Angry Men
308,mbhgkmsgg,12 Angry Men,10,17 November 2020,"Perfect. That's what 12 Angry Men is. Perfect. There isn't a thing about this movie I didn't love. The tension, the pacing, the room they're in, the acting, the filming, the directing, it's all perfect. Quite frankly, I'm a little mad that I hadn't seen this film sooner.The thing that stuck out to me perhaps the most was the pace and tension. Often, especially with older films, the pace tends to be relatively slow compared to more recent films. Yet, 12 Angry Men never slows down. There isn't a dull moment to be had. The only break we as the viewer get is when the jurors take their bathroom breaks. And even then, the conversations and debate continue. I personally love films that never ease on the pace and tension, and this one certainly doesn't.I also loved the pacing in terms of the story. The way information was revealed to the viewer in these deliberate increments made me get on the edge of my seat and stay there until the film ended. I was, of course, on the side of Juror #8 from the get-go, so I was always rooting for him to get his view through. But that doesn't mean that I would deny the fact that the opposing side made great arguments as well. As such, I was constantly waiting for what the counter-arguments from both sides would be.For a film about 12 men sitting in one room debating about their decision as a jury, 12 Angry Men is incredibly tense. And without that tension, this film wouldn't work. The reason, I believe, this film is so tense, is because the viewer is just as torn about the case as the jurors. The constant barrage of opposing views, both giving strong arguments, make it difficult to make up your mind. Just as much as it is a film about human nature and how opinions and preconceived ideas can affect our thinking, it's a film that forces the viewer to tackle these problems personally.12 Angry Men blew any expectations that I might have had right out the window. No matter how many great things I had heard, I never expected it to be so fantastic, and quite frankly perfect. I loved that it happened on the hottest day of summer and everyone was sweating. I loved that as soon as it started raining the fan started working. And I loved that it stopped raining as soon as they left the court building.

Ed Bagley is perfect as a rather ruthless, and somewhat, bigoted jorur. Henry Fonda give a rather fine performance as a cool under fire juror who is one the only ones to actual have an idea of what a juror should do. The way he baits at times the other juror members is amazing. Jack Klugman, in a small role, actually shows a true dramatic talent, serving him as one of the most versatile actors ever. This role, despite how small it is, Klugman gives a better performance then his more celebrated role on TV's The odd couple. My personal favorites of the movie are E.G. Marshall and Joseph Sweeney. Sweeney, in his last movie, leaves on a high note a wise old man. E.G. Marshall has a slight arrogance about him, and seems like he'd be the last person that Fonda would get to swing his way. Marshall almost upstages everyone else, despite like Klugman, playing a small role. Without a doubt, this movie is a must have for anyone collects.",12 Angry Men

What happens is Henry Fonda has to convince the 11 jurors one by one that the boy is innocent.The cast was incredible, Juror #1 was the take control Foreman. Juror # 2 was the mousy kind of guy. Lee J Cobb as Juror #3 did a brilliant job. Even though I'll always remember EG Marshall for playing Upson Pratt in Creepshow, I also admired his calm and intelligent character of Juror #4. Jack Klugman's Juror #5 was convincing as the street bred man. The working class Juror #6 I can relate to because my father was the same way. Everyone knows Jack Warden for his role as Big Ben Healy in Problem Child, and he was just as funny as the wisecracking Juror #7. Henry Fonda as the hero of the movie, Juror #8 was important giving his role as the good guy in many movies. Juror #9 as the wise old man did a nice job. Ed Begley made me laugh with his performance of the racist Juror #10. Juror #11 I couldn't relate to as an immigrant watch maker but he did play a vital role throughout the movie.

There is no need for a visualization of the crime; there is no need for fancy props (save for a knife and a diagram), there is no need for special effects.

316,kyle_c,"An excellent ""jury room drama"" - ****",9,31 May 2002,"Especially in our current state, the focus is more and more on special effects and visual appeal than on strong plots and good acting.  While many great movies have told their stories through visuals, ""12 Angry Men"" takes the opposite approach, telling the story through its characters, creating the feel of a stage play.The premise is that a young minority boy is charged with murdering his father.  Every jury member except one (Henry Fonda), believes that the boy is guilty.  Fonda doesn't necessarily believe him to be innocent, but rather that he just isn't sure.  He begins his attempt to point out how he feels and why he feels that way.  Through this, he reveals the insecurities and prejudices that are within everyone.The acting is first rate, from the angry, stubborn Juror #3 to Fonda, who creates a sense of integrity that he does so well.  Each man has a unique angle, and every actor portrays them well.The story and script are as close to perfect as can be.  I don't mean that the movie is perfect, but rather that this is a premise that is difficult to execute.  It would be easy to write this story so that it would not flow well, but it flows smoothly.  Perhaps one of the best screenplays of all time.The themes of this movie - it is more or less a character study - are beautifully written in.  They never become heavy handed, but are still easily seen.  Every man on the jury has some reason to quickly decide guilty, whether it be indifference, their own personal struggles, or prejudices.This movie is not a masterpiece of visual achievement.  It takes a rather unique approach to cinema, and makes itself a masterpiece in its own way.",12 Angry Men

Really who?!",10,28 August 2013,"12 Men with totally different personalities, located in a room with a bathroom, proved only through words and insults that justice is not an exact science. And also managed to become a timeless classic in the history of cinema thanks to a 20 years old director, Sidney Lumet cheers! The story of ""12 Angry Men"" is not one that can be reinvent or repeated (despite the fact that it had a good and underrated Reboot in 1997), because the young Lumet and screenwriter Reginald Rose made it a unique experience (and experience several times if you buy on Blu-Ray or download through the internet, easy enough). Everything begins on a normal day like any other in a court where the camera follows the corridors, and shows people and lawyers walking from one side to the other, people getting out fresh from the courtroom, some relieved some doesn't. Once we are in one room with the judge finishing the meeting and sending the 12 juries to the other room to decide the final sentence of a 18 year old boy that, as the evidence presented, ""prove"" that he killed his father in a rage attack. The Jurors come into the other room, normal mans who had never met and are there to lend their public service. All normal as if nothing was happening, certain that all the evidence is concrete and the boy is guilty, and a cold-blooded killer. But juror nº 8 (Henry Fonda) disagrees, he does not believe in the innocence of the boy, but also do not believe in his guilt. Now one man must face 11 that fully believe in the guilt of the boy and are tired to go home.Nowadays, the film for this new generation would be boring or perhaps ""impossible to happen"". Perhaps the film has to be viewed with a free and spirit mind to see the tremendous and beautiful message of justice that Lumet's classic tries to transmit. The film, NEVER for one minute gets to be boring or incomprehensible, the direction is superb and all that, but it's the script and the performances that stand out strongly in the film. A story that goes inside one room (and bathroom) had to have one writing at the level of ""non- boring "", no problems with Reginald Rose's screenplay with an amazing flowing narrative, I dare say that perhaps this is the best screenplay ever written (up there with ""The Godfather"" and ""Pulp Fiction"").From the beginning the audience grasps the plot heavily, not only by the superb script, but the wonderful performances. In the cast we have all the kings of acting from the golden age of cinema, from the heroic Henry Fonda to the ferocious Lee J. Cobb (juror nº 3), to the calm John Fiedler (juror nº 2) and the satirical Jack Warden (juror No. 7). I say the names of the actors because none of them mentions the name throughout the film, really putting the audience in that room with those men discussing the case.I say that the film proves that justice is not an exact science, because thanks to the character of Henry Fonda, the film is full of arguments and assumptions against all evidences presented at the beginning of the case, the case is not shown but through dialogs from the 12 characters. Arguments that are not only to the 12 to think and reflect, but to the movie's audience. Such arguments come in the form of structured dialogs; several of them focus on various topics since politics to social problems and even ophthalmology. The film is not boring annoying also because of the various funny moments with a good intelligent humor, but where there is room for humor there is too no place for pure tension between the characters, tension coming only by words .A classic that will forever be etched and remembered in cinema, thanks to a flawless script and a marvelous cast, a film full of tension and humor and a message of justice that fits perfectly in our today's society, and an emotive finale, ""12 Angry Men"" is a must see film at least once in your lives. and many more for pure pleasure!",12 Angry Men
318,AJ4F,"A classic study of ""reasonable doubt""",9,20 January 2010,"Before seeing this film - and having never served on a jury - I hadn't seriously contemplated the meaning of ""reasonable doubt"" in a legal context. Now, I can't imagine a better explanation than what's shown here. It was amazing that they accomplished so much with a simple set and somewhat stilted acting. There's never a dull moment, as you might expect from a film shot in just two rooms (court and jury).Every juror should watch this film to avoid tunnel-vision, especially if a death sentence is possible. It's common for people to lock on to an opinion and stop thinking entirely. Including those who consider themselves skeptics. The Fonda character represents a proportionally rare critical thinker.Knowing how thick-headed folks can be, especially those who fly the flag of conservatism, this film made me wonder how many court cases are decided fairly vs. hastily.

325,ccamp89,"A film so good, you'll feel like you've gained insight into life and humanity",10,17 May 2016,"12 Angry Men is a film that's so good and so powerful that, as the credits roll, you actually feel like you've gained a deeper understanding of humanity, our justice system, and life in general. I mean it. It's really that good. Twelve jurors of varying ages, personalities, cultural backgrounds and social standings enter a deliberation room to determine the guilt or innocence of a troubled teenage boy accused of murdering his father. It's quite a simple premise – a jury's deliberation – one that occurs daily all over the United States. But the film manages to wring every last drop of tension, drama, and social commentary from this commonplace scenario that it's impossible not to viscerally experience the true weight and implications of such a task – to search for the truth in a case of life and death.First things first: let's just appreciate how entertaining 12 Angry Men is. This is a film that takes place entirely in a single room, and tells its story completely through dialogue. And yet, it manages to be significantly more absorbing and enthralling than your average film with dozens of different locations and set pieces. The dialogue is so well-written and the characters so well-realized (and acted) that you become completely swept up in the proceedings. The pacing is also pitch perfect. The film rises naturally to a few emotional climaxes and confrontations, which are punctuated by quieter moments as the characters (and we as the audience) catch our breaths and process what has developed. And for a film that takes place entirely in such a confined space, there are a pretty incredible number of interestingly-composed sequences and long takes as the camera maneuvers from character to character and the drama unfolds. So yes, 12 Angry Men is a superbly entertaining film that absolutely flies by over the course of its brief hour-and-a-half running time. But it's also so much more than that. It's a film about ""truth"": its elusiveness, malleability, and vulnerability to the subjectivity of the human mind. Yes, there is a single objective truth to this, and likewise any real-life case; but the jurors don't know it, and neither do we. The objective truth isn't the point. The point is the impressionability of the ""truth"" – how it morphs in the minds of the characters (and in ours) over the course of the film, and how significantly it can be informed by our emotions, past experiences, memory (and its limitations), prejudices, and a myriad of other factors. The film is able to crystallize both the beauty and the folly of our judicial system. The beauty, as Henry Fonda's character points out, is that the scales are heavily tipped in favor of the innocent, that no man can be found guilty unless that guilt is beyond any reasonable doubt. The folly? The subjectivity of reasonable doubt, and the unavoidable reliance on a human jury who are influenced by all of the aforementioned factors.But ultimately, 12 Angry Man a film about us – people. Each juror in the film has a unique personality, temperament, and background which informs his opinion and motivates the role he plays in the story. Every juror gets his time to shine and the result is an ensemble that feels both diverse and extremely well- balanced.The strength of the characters in the film and the way they play off of one another is key to perhaps its most important theme: the danger of assumption, and the ease and quickness with which we judge one another. We watch as the jurors expose their biases and prejudices through their assumptions and judgments of the defendant, as well as one another. But even beyond that, the true brilliance of the film is that it subtly provokes the exact same snap-judgments from us as we watch. It's extremely easy to start to view the more critical jurors as the ""good guys"" and the dissenting, guilty-proponent jurors as the ""bad guys."" To invoke a psychiatric concept, we engage in splitting – seeing some of the jurors as ""all good"" and others as ""all bad."" We automatically begin to judge the seemingly more prejudiced and willful jurors, confining them to a box of our construction without knowing barely anything about them.But in its revealing final moments, the film snaps us back and urges us to look beneath the surface of those who we judge and ask an important question: why? Why does one juror spew prejudice and anger while another sits silently? What drives them to act in the way that they do? No one is born prejudiced, bigoted or racist. These are things we learn and which become incorporated into our personalities often through no fault of our own. The angry, prejudiced juror isn't inherently ""all bad,"" but simply reacts in a way that is informed by his accumulated life experience (much of which is subconscious). Of course, that doesn't mean that people can't and shouldn't be held accountable for their negative attributes and beliefs – we can always introspect and take action to improve our worst qualities. But that isn't the point. The film simply asserts that we should strive to understand before we judge, as understanding and empathy fosters connection where judgment simply divides. As Juror #3 – who we've likely judged and grown to despise throughout the film – weeps over the torn photograph of himself and his estranged son at the conclusion of the film, the message couldn't be clearer.12 Angry Men is a masterpiece. It is a film that marvelously succeeds on all the facets that every great film should. It's fabulously entertaining and engrossing, fantastically shot and acted, perfectly paced, and extremely thought-provoking. An undeniable classic whose themes will never lose their relevance.",12 Angry Men
326,Jini-B,A perfect piece of work,10,12 February 2018,"This movie has been on my radar for a very long time, consistently placing in all the Best Movies of All Time lists I've come across. Now I can testify to the fact that this movie is nothing short of cinematic brilliance! Every single moment in the movie, from the minute expressions to the big proclamations, had me marveling. The actors have performed with such sheer honesty that I couldn't take my eyes away.Most of the run time, I was gushing over the cast, their little jokes and long speeches, but it would be a crime for me to not mention the direction and the cinematography. The movie was shot so intimately, creating an almost unsettling feeling in the viewer. I could feel a persistent adrenaline rush throughout the run time. Every time there was a vote call, my heart would beat a little faster while awaiting the verdict. This is the very first time that I have watched a movie with any of these cast members and I realized what I had missed out on. From the moment the jurors enter the jury room to the moment after the verdict when they go back to their respective stations in life, these fine actors made me feel a connect to the characters and to the story, leaving me completely engrossed. That is possibly the biggest victory of a movie made in the past: Standing the test of time. And boy, did this movie exceed all my expectations.As I read the trivia after I finished watching the movie, I realized that at the current moment of my viewing, in 2018, all of the jurors have passed on. But to have been a part in making a timeless legacy like this one, maybe that's what it means, to have lived a fulfilling life.A timeless classic like no other I've watched so far.

330,jdhb-768-61234,Everyone should watch this film !,10,21 November 2018,"""12 Angry Men"" may be over 60 years old and may be in black and white, but it's nonetheless one of the greatest films ever made.Virtually the entire film takes place in the claustrophic atmosphere of a jury room, with 12 men, no women, adjudicating on the guilt or otherwise of a friendless Puerto Rican boy accused of murdering his abusive father. There are no names, not even for the jurors whose only identification is by numbers while the key witnesse to the supposed murder are referred to only as 'the old man' and 'the woman'. Apart from Henry Fonda, the cast is made up of actors who were never quite 'top names' and this adds to the tension as debate ensues.With only one true star, the rest of the jury are exactly what they should be - a disparate group with different backgrounds, experiences, prejudices and bigotries which quickly become apparent as Fonda raises questions about the prosecution's seeemingly strong case. One by one, the questions cause doubts to arise in the minds of those initially certain of the boy's guilt. Their own varied experiences contribute to the gradual realisation that perhaps the case against the boy is not so strong, then that it's debatable and, finally, that it's full of holes. Close up shots of individual jurors as they make their cases for a guilty verdict or come to realise that there is more to the case than they thought show the true anguish of their situation..The whole effect is to create a claustrophic yet magnificent spectacle. Superb dialogue, brilliant performances and direction, this is a sensational film. After watching it for the umpteenth time, I still find it gripping and compelling, one of the few films that I really can watch over and over again. 10 out of 10 ? Surely this is an 11.",12 Angry Men
331,TheNabOwnzz,"A riveting, tension filled 'thriller' in the confines of one single room",9,9 December 2018,"As a directional debut, you could do worse than Sidney Lumet's excellent '12 Angry Men'. It would be the beginning of an illustrious career, even though perhaps the heights of his debut would never quite be reached again.12 Angry Men is, apart from several opening shots, closing shots and a couple of scenes in a side room, filmed completely in one single room. To create a fascinating, character driven & tension filled picture can be quite difficult for some directors with this knowledge, but Lumet's direction here is world class. He uses the single location to enhance the feeling of claustrophobia, which also enhances a feeling of tension as all characters grow angrier as the film progresses. Much has been said about Lumet's use of camera angles to enhance the mood in our characters, such as the fact that the camera is generally placed at higher angles during the first act of the film, and gradually seems to be placed lower and lower towards the end, as more people are convinced of the 'not guilty' vote, so the camera emphasizes their superiority over the 'guilty' voters. Even though the film is largely in a single room, Lumet also uses weather conditions as a mood setter, with the setting being in a heatwave of some kind, and when the tables start turning towards the end in terms of the votes, the weather switches to pouring rain, which is generally an even larger symbolism of 'chaos', and that is precisely what is going on during the final moments of this picture.12 Angry Men is also undoubtedly one of the best acted films in cinematic history, with in particular Lee J. Cobb giving the performance of a lifetime. This is not just an angry character, thriving on nihilistic thoughts and hating on everything that happens, but a tragic character that is prejudiced due to his strained relationship with his own son. This brings forth another point, which are ofcourse all twelve characters. All of these characters have some kind of background, origin, and all of them behave very differently and according to their personal lives and experiences. An opening shot of the room featuring all of the jurors entering and bantering with eachother already gives the audience an idea as to what kind of people these jurors are. All the while Lumet uses very long takes, switching between mid-shots & wide-shots in single takes to create the most immersive and personal experience possible. Later in the film, when things start to heat up even more, he also induces a fantastic use of the close-up, which is ofcourse generally the most personal and direct of shot compositions.Furthermore, the screenplay by Reginald Rose is also a phenomenal addition to this film, as every single line of dialogue, character building and general confrontations enhance the tension significantly. Ofcourse, we do not get to witness extraordinary production design or scale due to the simplistic setting, but it is hard to imagine what Lumet could have done even better considering the material he was given.Due to Lumet's technical expertise, visual mood setters, claustrophic atmosphere & the fantastic energetic acting, it feels as a 'thriller' in a drama setting. Ofcourse the fact that the audience does not know anything about the case beforehand also helps, since the viewer will be even more compelled to follow the discussions used in this picture, because we do not know anything about the case yet. In the end, whether or not the kid is guilty is shown to be quite irrelevant, as this film is mainly a message about the interference of personal prejudice in terms of law. Every character, however, is displayed as having some kind of humane reason as to why they think a certain way. Even Juror #3, who, as stated before, relates the kid in question to his own relationship with his son.As one of the best-acted films of all time, combined with a fantastic screenplay, impeccable direction, in depth character development and characterization, 12 Angry Men is no doubt one of the greatest directional debuts ever made.",12 Angry Men

334,SimonHeide,true administration of justice is the firmest pillar of good,8,2 January 2008,"Overall I loved this movie. It shows the group-dynamics of 12 people, the jury, trying to decide if there is ""reasonable doubt"" concerning whether a young boy killed his father. The discussions are tense and little by little we learn from these what supposedly happened on that night the kids father died. We are therefore also drawn into the question of whether the boy did it or not ourselves and what at first seems like a clear cut case along the way becomes all of a sudden much more complicated. It is a film that dares to handle nuances and ambiguities (we are never certain of whether the boy did it or not) in a way we rarely see. Its also a movie that lets us watch these 12 angry men discuss in the same room for a full 96 minutes without it ever getting boring, which I have to respect; you really have to thrust your material to let a whole movie consist of a discussion.The movie also tries to show how personal issues can cloud the judgments of the jurors. I am thinking about one specific juror, and although the idea, of showing us how his own personal story interferes with sound judgment, is splendid, I frankly didn't like the way it unfolded in the movie. That's why I only give this movie 8/10.If this movie in any way is supposed to represent how the legal system work I pray to god that I will never be put in a situation where a jury have to decide my guilt in any matter.Regards SimonPs.

335,The_Celluloid_Sage,Cinematic Perfection,10,6 April 2020,"Before nineteen fifty-seven, Sidney Lumet was an up and coming television series director with a number of different shows to his name. Talented the man obviously was even at that early stage of his career. Meanwhile (in fifty-six) Fonda has seen the TV play by Reginald Rose of the same name and had contacted him to see if the script could be adapted to a feature-length version for the silver screen. Subsequently they became co-producers and financed the film themselves, one of the greatest films ever made and put onto celluloid.When filming began (which unbelievably only took nineteen days and three hundred and fifty thousand dollars or around three million today), Lumet would show the world just what an accomplished director he not only was, but would go on to be throughout the rest of his career. He truly belongs in the list of great American directors of all time, if not also the world. His vision, skill with the camera and obtaining the very best from his actors is second to none. 12 Angry Men shows all of his mastery and more (and was Oscar nominated for it) as he draws you deeper and closer into a story with a surprising amount of complex layers.As just stated, while seemingly a rather simple story, 12 Angry Men does have numerous layers of complexity and social issues. These include bigotry, racial tensions, social standing, prejudices, personalities and morality. All of these issues can be seen within our twelve jurors throughout the course of the film while deciding the innocence of guilt of a boy on trial for murdering his father. At its most basic structure, this is a courtroom drama with a simple tale that is woven into an intricate, compelling and gritty drama piece. A wonderful show of how the judicial system should work.The fate of a young ethnic boy lies in the hands of a jury, mostly made up of middle-aged white men. The entire film (with the exception of a very brief setup and epilogue) takes place within one small, claustrophobic room on a very hot day. We see nor hear any of the trial, witnesses or prosecution and only have a brief charge from the judge. Everything we learn about the boy, the case and all other matters we learn from our twelve jurors. As they file into this room we then quickly start to see which character is which personality and for what they stand and believe in. From this moment on you will be completely gripped.Guilty until proven innocent and beyond all reasonable doubt are two importan phrases here and form the basis of the script and the conflict among our jurors. In life, far too many are quick to judge, along with also being judge, jury and executioner at times. Lkewise some of our jurors share the same thoughts. One man alone stands true to his beliefs and morality that the boy cannot be convicted unless there the crime can be proven 'beyond all doubt', an act the prosecution or accuser has to prove, not the defense. Something some people (along with our jury) sometimes struggle to grasp with the preconceptions.This one man who beholds the rights of the constitution is juror number eight (Ford) who is the initial voice of reason within the group. Unlike many other reviews I will not spoil who is which character and what personal and prejudicial traits they have so you can ejoy finding out for yourself. I will however praise every single cast member, each one is wonderfully portrayed by seasoned and professional television actors. We have the meek, the controlling, the bully, the racist, educated, reserved, indecisive and the impatient as well as other character traits. All are shown brilliantly but special mention must go to Lee J. Cobb for his acting. Perfectly cast and intense in his performance that his character will stay with you long after the credits have rolled.Likewise with the acting, the script is simply superb. Tight, accurate and full of little twists and nuances, this is perhaps one of the best scripts you will ever hear spoken. Denzil Washington take note, this is how you write a dialogue heavy screenplay. No car crashes, explosions, fights, foul language, action scenes, just a taught expose of truths and half-truths spoken with conviction and heart from all those involved. You won't find many more films as utterly compulsive as this one. A real lesson to be learnt for any budding screen writer.As is the direction and cinematography which are both second to none and while simple in concept, are exucted to precise perfection. it is often said that the simplest things are life are the hardest to master. Lumet and Kaufman master them with ease and give the film its extra edge that it needed. Kaufman who had previously worked on ""On the Waterfront"" is amazing and shows off his skill along with Lumet. In using techniques to make the room look smaller and to close in on the actors, make the room appear to be closing in on those twelve jurors the increasing tension between the men is really heightened at key moments.Lumet also used different lenses and differing camera angles and heights to change or raise the mood as was needed. Many do not notice (a testement to his skill and the absorbing acting) but Lumet changes the height of the camera during the distinct thirds the film is broken into, slowly but surely ramping up the intensity and claustrophobia on us, the viewer while we see the same increase on the twelve jurors. Masterfully done. A film that has an intelligent plot (with a couple of little inconsistencies), believable characters and one of the few to be accurately labelled as a 'classic' in every way imaginable. About as perfect as you will ever get.The Sage's Rating:

336,antoniokowatsch,"Wow, what an amazing movie",9,28 August 2016,"I do have a penchant for older movies but this one is special. It perfectly highlights how keeping it ""smart and simple"" is the right way to go. The entire movie was basically shot in one room with 12 people arguing about a case. With that being said it was just as intense as any car chase. If you like seeing how people logically deconstruct a case in order to prove/disprove the defendants guilt this is the right movie for you. At first the whole case appears to be pretty ""black and white"" but as the jury (the 12 men) discusses details about the night of the murder new conclusions are being drawn. Conclusions that ultimately make them question their original standpoint. ""Is the boy really guilty?"" Watch the movie and find out.",12 Angry Men
337,darin-wissbaum,Would be considered politically incorrect today,10,18 July 2009,"What a classic of a film this is with some of the most talented of actors of the day. 12 men all from different backgrounds (stock broker, businessman, watch maker, accountant, architect, blue collar, salesman etc...) sit on jury to decide if a young boy should go to the electric chair for a crime he may or may not have done....the killing of his father. First most of the men (11 of them) are ready to convict either to get out of the cramped hot jury room or they really believe the boy did it. One man, Fonda, is convinced the boy is innocent or at least wants to talk about it before they rush and have a young boy die. ""it's not easy for me to send a young boy to the chair without talking about it first"" says Fonda. As the film continues Fonda slowly gets the other Jurors to see the flaws in the case and raise their doubts if the boy really committed the crime. One man is left (Lee J Cobb) who wants to see the boy burn based not on the evidence but personal feelings of his son that ran away from home years before. In the end however Cobb concedes and says the boy is not guilty. The boy may or may not have committed the crime but the point was that the case against him was weak and flawed. This film would never be accepted today for several reasons. First all the jurors where white men which would offend many people and I think it's crazy. Today it would have to have these types of characters: Angry black man or some other minority who has a problem with white people, bitter white feminist woman that hates men, a clueless white guy that everyone else on the jury would throw jabs at, single mother and anyone else that would fit the MTV Politically correct nonsense. It would lack the power 12 angry men had because it would spend too much time preaching about the injustice of the bankrupt lives of the jurors and it would lose focus. I'm sure the name of the film would be something like, ""12 angry people."" In any case 12 Angry Men is a powerful film and goes down as one of the best in film history. If people get offended today by it only because of the actors used they should stick to watching Michael Bay movies.",12 Angry Men

The real tension in this movie is the interaction between the jurors. Even though you mostly focus on Henry Fonda and Lee J.

Henry Fonda plays a juror who decides that the suspect is innocent and must face scrutiny from the other members of the jury and must battle them to prove the suspect is not guilty. Fonda truly shows a hero who tells viewers to fight for something you believe and fight against the odds even when people are against you. This is my favorite movie of all - time because of the conflict, struggle and tension between the men, along with the dramatic camera angles provided by the great Sidney Lumet who sets the entire story in one room where tension and anger begin to rise between the men in isolation. Henry Fonda is a great compliment to this movie giving an unbelievable top - notch performance displaying why they call him ""The Every Man"".",12 Angry Men
340,Mr_PCM,So simple yet unbelievably effective,10,2 March 2006,"12 Angry Men could serve as a textbook for how films can be brilliant without any special effects or action sequences. All you need is a good idea, and 12 Angry Men certainly has that.The film's premise could not be simpler; 12 jurors discuss a case and attempt to determine a verdict. It's as simple as that. In the wrong hands this idea could be a disaster, or at least deathly dull. However, Sidney Lumet has created a riveting character study investigating motivation and prejudices in ordinary men.The twelve are all from a great variety of backgrounds with widely differing attitudes. However, the case seems clear cut and they are all convinced the defendant is guilty. Except one. As the facts of the case are bandied back and forth, Henry Fonda, as the sole juror returning a not guilty verdict, must convince his eleven fellow jurors to think about the case more.It is hard to lavish enough praise on 12 Angry Men. It is also the first film I have reviewed where I simply cannot think of any criticisms whatsoever. The film is enthralling and extremely clever; it is impossible not to get caught up in the back and forth as the sole juror attempts to sway the opinions of the other eleven, gradually calling into question what seemed like a clear verdict. It is a fascinating insight into the unseen workings of the legal system, and how ordinary men really play a role in the system. Further, the characters are never given names, there are virtually no supporting actors for the twelve, and the entire film takes place within one room, enabling all attention to be focused on the details of the case rather than identifying with the characters. It is this that makes the film so simple yet unbelievably effective.Henry Fonda is one of the finest actors of his generation, but no one is overshadowed or shamed by his terrific performance, and everyone holds their own. All twelve actors give outstanding performances.12 Angry Men is a masterful film that should be compulsory viewing for any filmmaker. There was never a clearer display of what can be done without complicated plot lines, special effects, overblown action sequences or overbearing music. A great idea with a tight script and sound acting performances are all you need to make a timeless classic. Faultless.",12 Angry Men

I am no fan of Henry Fonda, but I do think this is his best work.  The rest of the jurors are also extremely good.  The mark of a good actor I believe is making us understand the character from the start of the movie.  We know what each juror is thinking from the start of the movie.  We don't have to have extensive character development because the characters are already developed in our minds.

Marshall and of course Henry Fonda to mention a few).'12 Angry Men' takes place in almost only one room, but still it is so far from boring. It was Sidney Lumet's first movie for the cinema, and it looks like that he already then had as much or even more experience and knowledge than any other director.The TV-remake from 1997 is suppose to be good, but I don't think it can match this version even if it contains some real good, heavy names such as Jack Lemmon and George C Scott.

I was completely absorbed, as if I was in the room with the characters themselves. Also, the entire plot is extremely clever, at the beginning I had my doubts as to whether the man would be able to convincingly persuade the others to vote not guilty, but I was totally convinced.

346,DVR_Brale,Sixty years later and still better movie hasn't been made,10,17 February 2017,"I wanted to take a while before writing anything about 12 Angry Men. Before I saw this movie I had been thinking about how can a black & white movie, made in the 50's and shot almost entirely in one room, be fifth on IMDb? Now, after seeing it, I'm thinking about why is it not rated even higher. In this review I'm going to try to explain what makes this movie so brilliant. First, have you noticed how this movie feels so natural? Not even once was I feeling bored or exhausted. Everything runs so smoothly, constantly making you more interested in what had really happened. One of the factors which makes this so is interrupting serious debate with brief and sometimes longer scenes which don't contribute to understanding the topic. Nothing is omitted. This dynamic (which Hollywood nowadays doesn't utilize) serves as a mean to present that humans don't operate as computers. We are intrinsically flawed and able to enjoy, be serious or disdain certain situation. Recall, for example, scene in the bathroom, talking about sports, playing with fan, etc. This gives viewer some space and time to think about what had been said. You can make your own judgment and defragment all information. Viewer thus becomes a sort of a ""13-th juror"" actively participating in a conversation.Second, this movie raises serious questions about how can we know anything about historical events. How do you evaluate and interpret given evidence? There are two schools about the topic: first claims that one can never objectively construct sequence of events because of our subjective nature; second claims that we can objectively assert what really did happen. This two approaches make much sense in 12 Angry Men. Some jurors are unable to objectively asses the evidence because they are very restrained by their own feelings or prejudices. The way they interpret the material is thus very biased (Juror #8: ""It's always difficult to keep personal prejudice out of a thing like this. And wherever you run into it, prejudice always obscures the truth."") The point is that every one of jurors (including the viewer) is biased but they take different approaches to the problem. This leads us to third point.Everything said above lead us naturally to the problem of jurisdictional decision making. The most important thing here is the term of reasonable doubt. Some of the jurors don't actually understand what does that mean so they can't handle the problem well. It somewhat scary thinking about how can twelve men from different backgrounds, of which some don't event understand or care about the case, make a decision about someones' life. If the juror is not convinced beyond reasonable doubt (not any doubt!), than he's obliged not to accuse defendant guilty. Reasonable doubt is the highest burden of proof one has to surmount if he's to accuse someone guilty. That's an important difference between exact sciences and law approach as one of the jurors notices (Juror #12: ""Oh, come on. Nobody can know a thing like that. This isn't an exact science."") So we see jurors one by one changing their belief when their certainty drops below reasonable doubt. This takes us to the next point.Let's take a closer look on the particular order each of the jurors voted not guilty. First you have a guy who just wanted to take a closer look at the evidence. He lit a spark. Then you have an old man wanting to hear why others think the accused is guilty. One by one the change their minds. The last ones where a guy who had prejudices about ""street children"" and the juror who was shouting all the time. This was done intentionally. People who had personal problems with something or someone are always hardest to engage in objective discussion about the issue. Forgiveness is a cure, not turning back on it. Nobody convinced the last juror to change his mind; he convinced himself after seeing a picture of his son. It's like his heart (not mind as with others) couldn't take it anymore. Juror before him had general prejudices. Those people can have a hard heart but are more easy to engage than those with personal problems. He realized his mistake after everyone had started to ignore him. Those with personal problems must confront them by themselves; those with prejudices must confront with others. So the conclusion is that it's harder to confront with someone whose problems lie in their heart than with those whose problems lie in their mind.Closing remarks: Table has always been an important component in our western culture. It's a place where all important decisions are made and where people get to eat and drink and know each other. That's why one the last shots is camera smoothly running over the table jurors where sitting at. Someone was there and something happened. It's a contrast to the last scene where we see Fonda leaving the building and disappearing into the crowd. Twelve men, who had never seen each other previously and don't even know each others names, with completely different backgrounds and profiles, accidentally sat together and did something important. Now they continue on, probably never seeing each other again. But table stands as a witness.There are many other elements left to be analyzed. It's better to speak about them sitting at the table discussing with other people than reading a review. I hope this general description of the movie mechanic helps someone understand what lies underneath the hood or makes her or him approach this movie with more scrutiny.",12 Angry Men
347,el_monty_BCN,This film should be taught to children in schools,10,16 January 2001,"Anybody in the world who wants or needs to learn something about the concepts of justice, democracy, freedom of speech, fighting against prejudice, reasoned thinking and plain common sense, should see this film. Which means that everybody in the world should see this film. And not just once, but every so often, so that we can keep reminding ourselves of how important these ideas are for a human society to work. Because, using the metaphorical space of a jury room, this is what this film talks about. Many others do as well, but none can reach the viewer as convincingly, with the power, the directness and heartfeltedness of ""12 Angry Men"". And that is simply because it is so unbelievably good. This is a masterpiece on not only one but two accounts: Artistically, as the perfect script, the perfect cast and the perfect direction simply cannot be improved upon; the film grips you from the first ballot count to the last minute with such vice-like grip that you almost feel like you are right there sitting in the room with the jurors; and ideologically, as this unsurpassable quality and capacity to absorb the viewer gives it the strength to drive home a moral lesson worthy of a Martin Luther King or Nelson Mandela speech. I hope one day this film will stand alongside ""Catcher in the Rye"" and the like in children's school syllabuses the world over, as I consider it one of the great Works of Art of the century and essential viewing for any person who wants to improve his or herself.",12 Angry Men
348,cleary-joshua,Imagine a filmmaker walking into a boardroom today and trying to pitch this...,9,31 December 2013,"Imagine a filmmaker walking into a boardroom today and trying to pitch the following movie: 12 men sit in a room for 90 minutes in real time and argue with each other. They're discussing a murder case, but the murder isn't actually shown, they just talk about it. It would be shot down today, because it's not the kind of movie that we're used to seeing in cinemas – public tastes have changed. Or so Hollywood seems to think, but this movie is in IMDb's 10 top rated movies of all time. This took me slightly by surprise before I saw ""12 Angry Men"". It's a movie made more than 50 years ago, and yet it's still more popular than any ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""Star Wars"" film. It's a testament to the public, I think, showing that old movies have not grown stale, and are still appreciated as much as new flicks.The film itself completely deserves its position on the IMDb list. It's not one of the best movies ever made, but it is a skilfully crafted, well acted drama which is intellectually stimulating and actually quite thrilling throughout, despite the lack of action. It's far more than it says on the tin, since each one of its 12 characters is well written and of great importance to the story. Henry Fonda particularly shines in the film as the one juror trying to fight for a ""not guilty"" verdict on the grounds of reasonable doubt. He takes it upon himself to convince the other 11 to change their minds, and through this, changes the audience's view of the case as well. The progression of his arguments and logic is extremely clever and his unpicking of information that we've had throughout makes us admire him even more.The film covers so much ground in so little time and space. All of the jurors are unnamed for the majority of the film, and we're not dealing with specific characters most of the time, but members of the public from all parts of society. There's someone each of us can relate to, and we leave the film considering how we would deal with the case. Lumet uses the single setting to his technical advantage, managing to create a disturbing sense of claustrophobia as the film progresses, and the use of real time is so important in making us feel like we're on the same level as the characters and not missing a single detail.""12 Angry Men"" completely deserves to be seen as a classic.

Despite how there is largely only one set and one set of characters, the film is still very entertaining. I was engaged throughout.

352,gaityr,An acting and writing tour de force!,9,5 October 2002,"12 ANGRY MEN is quite simply a film masterpiece. You might not know it from the description--12 jurors who are complete strangers to one another are collected in one room to decide a murder case. 11 believe the defendant, a young boy from the wrong side of the tracks and living in the slums, is guilty, beyond the shadow of a doubt. The last one, Juror #8 (Henry Fonda), believes there is a reasonable doubt about the boy's guilt. How Juror #8 eventually gets the other jurors on his side is the point of the entire film, and it almost entirely takes place in the one small room. Hardly splashy, with no special effects--just 12 actors, a script, and the camera.
Sounds boring? This film is anything but. Reginald Rose writes a great story, and though you sometimes get the feeling that this film is meant to be a play, that's largely due to the slightly claustrophobic feel of having the entire proceedings of the film take place in one room. Works for a play, but in a film, one expects cuts to other places, wider shots etc. Still, even this counts in favour of 12 ANGRY MEN, because it forces one to concentrate on the case, the dialogue, the actors, the characters. Of course the film is talky. There's hardly any action. But it couldn't be more well-paced or timed. In fact, it's exciting, in its way. Every time a new vote is called, every time a vote changes to 'not guilty', the audience feels the triumph of something, some 'je ne sais quoi'. Director Sidney Lumet does an excellent job of manipulating the black and white medium he chose for this film, making the film timeless (even more so than the 1997 TV remake with Jack Lemmon in Fonda's role--yes, the jury is no longer one of '12 Angry White Men', but colour still dates a film in a way black and white doesn't). The character study is really what makes the film: you'll recognise everyone in that jury room, from the non-strident nonconformist (Henry Fonda) through to the man who has such great difficulty separating his personal emotions from the facts of the case (a stunning Lee J. Cobb). There's the bigot (Ed Begley) who realises that his words will always fall on unsympathetic ears; the flighty guy who just wants to get to his baseball game (Jack Warden); the shrewd old man who shouldn't be discounted just because of his age (Joseph Sweeney); and the stuffy intellectual (E.G. Marshall) who isn't too uptight to change when he realises he's wrong. That's only half the cast of characters in this film, and aside from the rather unfortunate foreman or Juror #1 (Martin Balsam), every single character is well fleshed-out and a believable person. You can understand the reasons why they change their votes; it's all perfectly within character. Quite an accomplishment, to bring to life 12 men in the space of one and a half hours. Much credit, of course, must go to the writing of Rose for real, credible characters and dialogue. One remains riveted to the film even though it's mostly talk and no action; that's surely an indication of how great the writing and acting in 12 ANGRY MEN is.Henry Fonda does a fine job as the man who initially stands alone with his own reasonable doubt. As usual, he underplays his character rather than grandstanding it, thus allowing for his fellow actors to shine in the showier roles. All of them turn in brilliant performances, but of particular note would be Cobbs, whose final impassioned stand as the odd man out (in a complete reversal of the beginning of the film) is simply stunning. Marshall and Sweeney are excellent in their roles as well. This is most certainly one of the best films ever made: understated, underplayed, but definitely not over-rated. You've heard about 12 ANGRY MEN, I'm sure--so if you haven't seen it, why not? You're missing out on a great script, a great cast, and a great moral about the value of democracy in the American judicial system (one that isn't hammered into the audience--it's made with no self-congratulatory fanfare). Watch this--it's worth it.",12 Angry Men
353,KIDOLOHKEN,12 different characters.,10,5 November 2019,"Whenever I watch a video, I always study the story structure.
When I first saw this movie, I thought it was a so complicated story
However, when analyzed, I knew this is surprisingly simple structure.
Consist of two lines.
One is a mystery. Solving the mystery of the mystery was very easy, it is simple.
The other is chasing human drama. The human drama is also relatively easy.
However, when these two are mixed nicely the story structure come to looks very complicated.
I think that is a point that aspiring movie write should study this case.
And most important fact of this story is characters. Each character is vivid, characteristic. It generates human conflict. Among it, my favorite thing about this movie is Henry Honda's beautiful eyes.
I think Henry Honda's eyes always have the power of justice in any movie he acts.

I love the movies of the 40's and 50's and I would have to say that 12 Angry Men is up there as one of the best 5 movies of that era for me. There are some many things happening in this movie, that it takes more than one viewing to pick it all up. The camera work is first class, starting off with full view of all 12 jurors, and as the movie progresses and the jurors re-asses their decisions, the camera show the jurors looking straight down the lens, giving the impression they are talking straight to the audience. No names are given till the very end of the movie and then it is only 2 jurors, apart from a quick scene in the courtroom and outside at the end, the rest of the movie is filmed in the jurors room on a hot stinky summers days.

355,curzon_dax,"Almost perfect move, near 10. with a flaw",9,26 February 2020,The flaw that makes this movie a 9 and not a 10 is that when the racist and the prejudiced jurors changed their minds it wasn't done very realistically in my opinion and more in a theatrical way that didn't feel very believable to me. I guess it was done so that there can be a favorable conclusion otherwise if it would be done more realistically it may had been a hung jury however I can't help but wonder it is possible to do it in a way that was believable and still have the same outcome so I guess that's something for future movies to achieve.,12 Angry Men
356,varundelpiero,Reasonable Doubt...,9,27 October 2008,"The concept of 'Reasonable Doubt' is highly pervasive within the Judicial System; it is the concept that eventually decides the fates of the accused, and is the concept that is one of the most controversial. It's controversy lies in the fact that it is purely subjective, and dependent on the individuals that comprise the jury. The notion of Reasonable Doubt has no one definition, yet it is almost universally known. In 12 ANGRY MEN, Sidney Lumet successfully gives the viewer an idea of how this concept comes into play in a trial.It is worth noting that while this may be one of the best courtroom movies of all time, it doesn't in fact occur in the actual courtroom; all but 3 or 4 minutes of this Motion Picture is spent in the confines of a Jury Room, where the verdict is hotly debated. Lumet does well to present the Room as a sort of confinement from which there is no escape until a unanimous verdict is decided. As the film progresses, the sense of urgency and claustrophobia sets in, and the tension becomes increasingly high. The first technique Lumet used was to employ the locked door. The second was to cue the rain, which gives the feeling that even the outdoors are 'inaccessible' and that only the Room exists. The third technique may be missed by less astute viewers; Lumet switches his scope from wide to narrow to close-up during the movie, which adds to the claustrophobic feeling mentioned earlier.The acting is top-notch, as required by any good character study. All 12 men have been developed to some appreciable extent, but the key players have been developed to a comprehensive level given the film's ~95 minute run-time. Henry Fonda is brilliant as the 'hesitant' juror, but to me Lee J. Cobb outshines him in almost every scene (save the opening scenes).Another aspect of the film worth mentioning is the Music (or lack thereof). This is another intentional ploy by Lumet to give the viewer a 'feel' of the Room. There is no Music in the Jury Room, so why should there be in this film? I agree that while a musical background score serves to enhance or capture the mood of the scene, sometimes the absence of the music (silence) speaks volumes, by allowing the viewer to concentrate fully on the scene(s). One of my favourite movies lacking in music is NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN. Another brilliant score-less Motion Picture is CAST AWAY, where no music is used for the entire length of time that Tom Hanks is stranded.The screenplay is solid and intelligently sound. In fact the only thing that stopped this film from winning Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Screenplay was the excellent THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. Had the movie been made a year or two earlier, it may well have won the esteemed accolades.I can see why this film ranks in IMDb's All-time Top 10. It is simply a brilliant Motion Picture that has wide appeal, and can be enjoyed and appreciated by many.4 stars (out of 4). 8/10. Will appear in my Top 200 at around 167 or so.

359,MetalAngel,Utter cinematic perfection!,10,8 September 2009,"Sidney Lumet's ultimate masterpiece ""12 Angry Men"" is a paramount in film history and is certainly the most memorable of courtroom dramas, a film that stands true to what intelligent, perfectly-made cinema ought to be.The plot is simple enough. It's about twelve men from different social backgrounds and jobs who make up the jury of a murder trial for an 18-year old kid who has allegedly stabbed his father in cold blood. They (the jury) must now retire to a private chamber and discuss the verdict before sentencing the murderer to either death or freedom. The entire film, then, takes place inside this chamber and follows the arguments and quite heated discussions between these twelve angry men, as they attempt to reach an unanimous vote.From the start, while the men accommodate themselves in the room, we're introduced to them and their personalities, their likes, and basically we gather enough information to discern the type of person each of them is like. Also, they are never identified by their names, but are referred to according to how they were sitting in the trial, with a number from 1 to 12. It is in this setting of anonymity, of a locked room which is practically boiling in heat, that twelve different personalities clash, different points of view are alternately objectified and refuted, and the future or doom of a man is tactfully decided.It's a masterpiece, I tell you. The screenplay is sent from cinema heaven (Reginald Rose is a masterful screenwriter), for what begins as a discussion to eliminate all possible doubts becomes a passionate, gripping and utterly suspenseful probing into a different area of human bias. The ball is bounced back and forth among different subjects, and it's such a harrowing game they play that we watch transfixed through the entire duration of the film, uncertain of anything and equally unsure what to make of it. Is the kid really guilty or is he innocent? No one knows, they merely speculate, and like one of them says, ""Who knows what could be worse: sending an innocent kid to his death or letting a cold-blooded murderer free to do as he wishes?"" The theme is searingly vivisected and analyzed, and you'll find your own morals, ideas and reasonings both questioned and assured in a mind-blowing way.Apart from the terrific screenplay (enhanced by rapid-fire, witty dialogue), Sidney Lumet has done wonders with space and cinematography. The fact that such delicate and controversial topics are being dealt in a stifling hot room by twelve men who are rapidly loosing their patience deals for an emotional powerhouse. Nothing can be avoided. Also, the camera angles, the focus of the camera itself, makes the room even seem smaller and more suffocating by the minute, with increases the heat of the arguments and the sharpness of the remarks. I read somewhere that the first shots in the movie are taken at a high angle and they slowly decrease to a point where, by the end of the movie, they're below the character's faces (I watched the film again and this fact is true). Also, different lenses were used to give the impression that the walls were shrinking. I tell you, it's cinematic perfection.The acting is point-perfect. Henry Fonda delivers a searingly intelligent performance as one of the jury members who poses most of the troubling questions, and amongst the other twelve, Lee J. Cobb, Ed Begley, E.G. Marshall and Jack Warden are equally powerful and entrancing. Overall, the film lasts a little over an hour and a half. But it's an hour and a half of pure delight, of witnessing amazing cinema unlike any we've seen in recent times. I mean, the film was made in 1957, and it's still as fresh and as original as if it had been released yesterday, even with an unnatural quantity of courtroom dramas that Hollywood spews out.I've seen my good share of courtroom dramas, and even in my young age I happily come to discover films like these that even having been done way before my time still manage to be more interesting than many.Rating: 4 stars out of 4!!",12 Angry Men

Remarkably the whole 96 minutes take place in the jury room, its ever so simple but captivating throughout which is why this film deserves its mounted praise and my standings of it as being up there with Hitchcock's Vertigo.Fonda pulled off a blistering and powerful performance playing the rebel of jury.

364,Aditya_Gokhale,Brilliance Unlimited!,10,11 November 2008,"Now here's that kind of a film, writing about which is a major task! Words are not enough to describe this gem, which after 51 years of its release, has stood the test of time..and still packs the punch. All the newfangled courtroom dramas of later times cannot hold a candle to this ""classic"" in the true sense of the word. I was shocked to read it performed poorly at the box office on initial release, in spite of the huge critical acclaim. The movie, which is the directorial debut of Sidney Lumet, is the film adaptation of Reginald Rose's play. The screenplay for the film was penned by Rose himself. The story is fairly simple, with 12 jurors assigned the task of presenting a verdict on the case of a boy accused of killing his father. What seems to be an open and shut case, takes an ambiguous turn when one of the jurors votes ""not guilty"" against eleven others voting ""guilty"". This leads to some immensely gripping and taut drama full of very interesting debate that never lets up until the words ""The end"" appear on the screen! Wonderfully directed by Sidney Lumet, this is quite possibly the best film of his career. There are lots of unique features of this film. The cast is all-male. None of the character names are revealed (almost). They only have a ""juror number"" to identify each other by. The entire film (with the exception of a couple of small scenes) is shot in one small Jury Room. The performances are all superb. The most notable ones are those delivered by Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Joseph Sweeney, George Voskovec, Ed Begley, Jack Warden and Jack Klugman.""12 Angry Men"" is a movie that is sure to appeal to every generation. It is one of those ""immortal"" movies that never age with time! And it is surely an example for all filmmakers and movie-buffs.

The film surprised me in how progressive it was, and the ending social conclusions that it reached.In the film you can see clearly form a rift between the upper class, conservatives who are unwilling to change and the progressives who are proposing change for the better of all of us; this film, deep down, is a very class conscious and socially conscious film about discrimination and the deep lines it had in American society in 1957.Although the film's portrayal is sometimes overly simplistic, drawing a ""stubborn, pig-headed"" conservative versus ""righteous, just"" progressive, one can find that this was very much so a necessary film for its' time. In many ways, it is a work that was socially far advanced.Also what is interesting is the fact that it is a film that is done with great simplicity; some actors, and a room... It relies greatly upon the pure talent of the actors, and the great direction of Sidney Lumet -- this film is truly unique due to the true minimalism it embraces in its' production tactics, yet this is something that could easily go unnoticed due to the incredible quality of the film.",12 Angry Men

While it is a courtroom drama set in a jury room, in a lot of ways it is also a detective story, as the jurors try to piece together what exactly happened the night of the murder and find out it isn't as clear cut as they thought in the court room. 12 Angry Men shows how people from different backgrounds and with different personalities view justice, and how those opinions come out in the confined space of the jury room. Even after watching it and knowing what the verdict will be, you'll want to see it again in the future for the great interaction between the characters.

It does not matter if the boy was actually guilty, the movie is not a murder mystery, but that there is not indisputable evidence against him that would in turn sentence him to death.

Apparently all but 3 of the 96 minutes length of this film was in shot in that room. I am not into camera angles and lighting and such its the whole effect that I am interested in and the experience of watching this film was spellbinding. When I watch this film I am always drawn to the one voice in the room who isn't sure about the guilt of the accused. Just imagine being in his shoes under those circumstances and you can see how easy it would be to say yes he is guilty can I go home now, after all the eleven other jurors are probably right so I will just agree with them. But this one juror applied a certain amount of logic and was determined enough to resist the jeers and negative comments and demand that he be listened to and of course he gets his concerns over and most people know the ending.

The way personal opinions and prejudices hinder the factual discussions in really interesting ways, and how several character go through satisfying arcs as they realize what they're saying. The perfect pacing and the plot which doesn't give anything away for free. There is no definitive answer, we don't get to see the murder happen. All we get is 12 strangers talking about it for 90 minutes.There's something mesmerizing about the unraveling of the mystery, the way each consecutive point made builds logically on what has previously been said, the way the camera slowly spirals lower and lower and the increasing use of close-ups to establish the increasing uneasiness among the men. I also absolutely adore the simplicity of it all. There has been a lot of movies mostly taking place in one room, Quentin Tarantino particularly is quite good at only using a few locations, but I am fairly confident in saying that there has never been, and probably never will be, any movie pull it off quite like this one.

I can safely say that this movie alone is objectively better than anything I have seen in recent years. There are no explosions, no gun fights or car chases.. There is virtually no action in this movie. This is not an epic by any means, the entirety of this movie takes place in a court room with 12 people deciding the guilt or innocence of a 18 year old boy . Sounds boring in theory but the dialogue is absolutely superb! It got more intense with each second and the acting is like nothing I have ever seen before.

Henry Fonda has a nagging feeling that the kid is not guilty and has to argue masterfully to convince his fellow jurors (some are harder than others).  What makes this film great is the same reason people like to see comeback wins in sports and why impartial sports viewers tend to root for the underdog.  Throughout the whole film, you have a feeling that Fonda is going to win, but seeing him do it is exciting.

The building has countless rooms, and many trials are underway that could determine the results of someone's fortune or whether someone gets to keep his or her liberty. Outside one room, a woman weeps while a man encourages her. Inside another one of these rooms, a bored judge reads instructions to a bored and inconvenienced jury, most of whom want nothing more than either to go watch the ballgame or else just go home.Inside the jury room, almost everyone is eager to render a verdict, send a young man to the chair, and move on with their lives.

There is more and more movement, the surface of the water is clearly undulating, and the water is getting hotter. Bubbles again begin to form at the bottom of the pot. They expand and begin to rise, but collapse and disappear. The expansion and collapse of the water vapor creates noise and the pot begins to vibrate. Then traces of water vapor begin to rise from the rolling surface of the water. Finally, the bubbles of water vapor survive the journey to the surface and emerge - releasing steam to the air.

Beside the fact that this was the year I was born, there were some great movies from that year. ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" is one and ""12 Angry Men"" is another. No special effects, no lavish sets, no tropical backdrops. ""12 Angry Men"" depends on real acting and intellegence for success. A open and shut case brought to the jury room for quick debate, is set in a stark, black and white setting. Most of the movie takes place in a small, plain room, with no air conditioning. Not exactly the formula for a entertaining movie. But the cast, led by Henry Fonda and Lee J Cobb, bring color and intensity to the screen. Unlike so many movies of today, filled with physical violence and explosions, this movie is filled with verbal sparring and explosions from within the heart. Watching the movie, I felt like I was closed in that small room with the jurors. The movie has the feel of being shot in a couple of hours, instead of the weeks it actually took. This is remarkable because the scenes seem seemless. The movie was a bomb in 1957, but compared to today's formula of sex, aggresion and rock and roll, ""12 Angry Men"" is a blast from the past. It is 'the bomb!'",12 Angry Men
384,faroukgulsara,All for a life and the element of doubt!,9,10 December 2019,"This is one of those films whose story started as a radio drama to make it to become a stage drama and later into films in many languages from English to German to Russian to Hindi to Kannada and the story had been featured in many TV Serials including 'Happy Days' where Fonz did his jury duty.
The movie starts with the judge instructing the 12 juries to be ushered to a room for deliberations before deciding on the guilt of a 18 year old Hispanic boy from a broken home who have allegedly stabbed his father to death.
At first look, it looks like a open and shut case to most jury members. The crime and the chronology of events is only made available to us as we listen to the discussion that goes on in the hot and stuffy room.
The 12 members are all Caucasian males of different professions. No names are made available to us, only their professions (car salesman, architect, ad man, architect, watch maker, painter, man who grew up in slum). The heat in the room also took the toll on the mood of the jury. Most of them are eager to finish off their tour of duty as soon as possible and continue the usual lives. So, when the architect (Henry Fonda) suggests that he would like to discuss the case before deciding in the fate of the young man, they naturally get annoyed. They put their decision to a vote. The initially outcome was 11 to 1 for a guilty charge. As the decision was not unanimous, they started talking. They all agreed that the defence counsel, probably working pro bono, did not put his mind and soul to defend such a case as it was not rewarding and the boy was a delinquent anyway.
They also realised that there were pitfalls in the witness' story. An eye witness alleged saw the act from a moving train and another, a hemiplegic neighbour supposed to have dashed at a quick pace to witness the event.
As the discussion goes on, they put the verdict to a vote. As time goes on more and more people started having second thoughts on passing a guilty charge.
More and more people get into each other's nerve.
The story goes on with finally with the vote goes on 11-1 in favour of a not guilty charge when somebody realised that the lady witness could be wearing glasses, hence it was not possible for her to identify the assailant as she was lying in bed and people do not generally wear glasses when they are going to sleep.
The last man standing soon realized that he was recalcitrant because of unresolved issues with his son with whom he was not in speaking terms. He finally gave a not-guilty charge making it an unanimous decision.
This film is very cerebral in nature with all scenes happening in a room with no action, swashbuckling scenes or special effects. And on top of it, there is not a single female in the cast of actors. It gives good lessons in the art of persuasion and reasoning. Jack Klugman (Quincy M.E.) and Jack Warden are the familiar faces in the movie together with Henry Fonda.
The interesting thing about this story is that they stereotype class, not ethnicity. One has to remember it was made before the era of the Black Liberty and gender equality movements. Hence, there were no African Americans and women in the panel of jury. Only a nationalised European (probably Swiss) was there.

I grew up with action packed, CGI-filled, heavy scenery changing films. A film like this however, is completely new territory for me. I feel like during this film I would appreciate it even more than I have, if I would be older. It was a bit too psychological for me.Despite this being a heavy film to swallow, it was a really good film. Most of the film took place in one single room, with 12 men - from the jury - arguing whether an 18 year old boy should be found guilty of commiting the murder on his father. That's the whole film. But this sheer simplicity combined with one of the most fantastic acting in a film I have ever seen by every single one of the 12 juries, made up for such a good film.
The amount of emotions and words flying through that room felt so real. This and that the camerawork for the time was really nice, made me feel like I wasn't watching a film. It made me feel like I was watching 12 men of the jury argue a lot, and I was just there spectating them.It was a really interesting film and I definitely recommend anyone this film, and I will get back to this film in the future.

I instead, it focuses on twelve men, locked into a room to decide the fate of a man on trial for murder. It is the hottest day on record outside, and tensions mount as the agendas of each man are exposed, analyzed and ultimately dealt with in one way or another. At the beginning of the film, eleven of the twelve men vote for a guilty verdict, but one man holds out, and upholds the principles of the system he is a part of.This film is pretty flawless. It is a dramatic look at the court systems that existed in the United States in the '50's. Eleven men are willing to condemn another to death with little thought, but one needs to convince the others they are wrong. It is also well set, with the hot and humid environment and the booming thunder and pouring rain of a summer storm playing in the background outside, as the men inside struggle against there inner prejudice and demons. The film is wonderfully directed, shot and acted by an all star cast from the 1950's, including the great Henry Fonda. Each character is unique, a real individual, with their own prejudices, flaws and quirks. Each one tries to make the others see their way of thinking, or to speed up a conclusion.I could go on, but much more and much better reviews have been written already. Suffice to say, 12 Angry Men is a classic American film. It is towering in its simplicity, and tense as anything else.

Nice short runtime, small cast, all filmed in one room.m, it's just so tight. The beauty of it is that just from dialogue alone we are thoroughly entertained and it maintains a sense of tension throughout. The crime is never re-enacted, it's from the descriptive dialogue that we picture it in our heads. Writer Reginald Rose knew that the most powerful tool in film was words. The cast was high calibre, Henry Fonda leading the view of not guilty. It's pretty difficult to go against him when he is full of suaveness and so convincing. We get to know each juror as the film goes on and we soon start to explore the possibility that their personal lives are tainting their decision. That, was what made it so palpable. It was clouding their judgement, and their stubborn personalities made it all the more satisfying if they did change their mind. Persuasion is a powerful tool, but add a hint of conviction and you can manipulate anyone's mind. Several nice details were included, I like the fact it was set on the hottest day of the year. The heat evidently getting to the jurors, it made them more irritable and heightened the angry emotions within. Director Sidney Lumet did so much in such a little space, technically. When the jurors enter the room, its a sublime long five minute shot and he manages to share the screen time with each juror equally. He was able to convey their personalities instantaneously just by their attire, then when the discussion commences we start to dig a little deeper. The screenplay really is the winner here, if anything it makes me want to work in law. Dramas do not come better than this, 12 Angry Men easily gets the perfect rating. It sits in the inclusive list of masterpieces.Mitchell Bulfin",12 Angry Men

2. The performances of each and every actor is great.
3. The whole film is set in one room which is quite brave as it was made in 1957.
4. The characters are realistic.
What's bad:
1. The film is 63 years old and made in black and white. So it might take a little time for today's audience to get used to it.
Overall, it is a good film.",12 Angry Men

Unlike a Sayles movie, you know how 12 Angry Men will end, but there are such polar opposites on the jury that the intrigue is in what could possibly cause one of them to change his vote. It's not only that you should see it because it's good, you should see it because it teaches, reminds, and/or reinforces very important lessons on morality and how society should function. It's a timeless film.",12 Angry Men

396,hbdave_77,A nugget of Lumet...,9,25 November 2008,It's case of 18 years old boy who killed his own father with a knife & there are enough testimonials & proofs to prove him guilty. A jury consists of 12 men has been appointed to solve this court trial with their unanimous vote in a room. Now this is not the usual plot. It's the thesis of the film. How it become anti-thesis & arrives in the end with synthesis on a discussion table among these 12 jury is a thing to watch here. Sidney Lumet has directed so many brilliantly scripted films but this one is his real masterpiece & remains classic forever. Without a doubt this is Henry Fonda's career best performance played with a reasonable nuance. Lee J. Cobb as the last stubborn man standing also did a brilliant work.Highly Recommended.Ratings-9/10,12 Angry Men
397,HunterDK,This movie is excellent build,9,7 April 2003,"I must say that this movie is really well written, directed and performed.The movie starts with evidence that looks like a clear case, but one juror is not sure. It would be wrong, if I said more about the story, but it develops in a very interesting way.Each of the jurors have their reasons for finding the accused guilty or not guilty. You see the jurors small talking with each other, and each little story reveals something about the persons. This is perfect character building, it was really made in an impressive way.The concept is very simple, 12 men discussing a case in a room. It does not sound interesting, but it for sure is. The actors perform excellently, each actor creates an unique character, it is simply just amazing to watch their discussions. I think it would be unfair to mention one actor, because all of them do a fantastic performance.You could say that it does not require a good director to create such a simple movie, but that is very wrong. Director Sidney Lumet really understood how to focus on the right discussions at the right time, he builds the characters with the camera, he did an excellent job.""12 Angry Men"" is an impressive movie. I have rated 454 movies, and only 11 movies have been rated 9/10 or above, and this is one of them. I will rate it 9/10, it's one of the best of all time.",12 Angry Men

What I liked most about 12 Angry Men are the characters. Talented actors and the great director Sidney Lumet brought them to life. I think the most powerful scene was when Henry Fonda's character pulls out the knife and throws it onto the table. I almost got up from my chair just like the rest of the jurors. I've been watching dozens of classics in recent months, and 12 Angry Men is the best pre-1972 movie that I've seen.The 1997 remake is supposed to be very good as well.

However, a lot of the top 250 movies were boring for me so this was not a strong indicator of quality.The only boring portion of the movie were the first 30 seconds. Afterwards you are thrown in a room where you can observe and understand human nature better than in 4 years as a psychology major.This is a movie about how our past, our jobs, our social, emotional, mental, economic contexts determine who we are. We have the guy who simply doesn't care. We have the shy guy who is very smart but influenced and by the end of the movie, gains confidence and courage. We have the passive aggressive guy. We have the wise guy. We have the aristocrat.We have 12 different personalities, thrown in a room trying to reach a single conclusion. And how they do that, each on their own is art. This movie is amazing, not only as artistic value but from what it can teach you. It is paced so well, not a moment longer, not a moment sooner. The actors are generally amazing and Henry Fonda played his role very, very well. Without trying to insult this masterpiece, it's like Big Brother but with a strong, very strong intellectual and maybe even philosophical background.",12 Angry Men
400,AppleBlossom,Fonda's on a winner,10,30 December 2004,"This is easily one of the best courtroom drama's you could ever watch. A mighty directional debut for Sidney Lumet, who was also associated with such memorable films as; Murder On The Orient Express, Dog Day Afternoon and Network. It's a story about 12 jury members deliberating on the fate of an 18 year old boy (on trial for the murder of his father). One man stands alone (Henry Fonda) trying to convince the other 11 not to be so hasty with a guilty verdict. It's quite amazing how the story unfolds by only verbal context, there's no flash backs on what went on in the courtroom or the presumed scenario of the murder. All is done by script alone and to this basis the viewer has to pay particular attention. The cast is superb, not big stars at the time, but in later years very well known. I was intrigued with the 12 characters, each one of them a different personality who come from a different walk of life. They were all strangers, the viewer is never told of any of their names, only at the end we hear the surnames of juror # 9 and juror #8 This film gives a indispensable lesson in characterization there's so much to like about 12 Angry MenI highly recommend it. 10/10",12 Angry Men

402,leosmith-11166,"12 Angry Men, 1 Fantastic Man",10,23 November 2015,"In Sidney Lumets classic masterpiece, 12 Angry Men, starring Henry Fonda as Juror 8, tells the story of a jury's decision for a Young Latino Man convicted on murdering his father. The Jury, filled of the 12 Angry Men, then vote, discuss and debate whether this boy is guilty and whether he should face the Electric Chair.Firstly, all praise has to go to the minimal Cast. There may be few, but those few actors perform some of the greatest performances of All Time. Henry Fonda stars as Juror 8/The Architect, the member of the Jury who wants to convince the rest of his Jury's Peers that the man is not automatically guilty because he's Latino. Henry Fondas fine performance is very memorable, and his character is very lovable. One of the great things about 12 Angry Men is the great display of character development. The change of the Jurors is breathtaking and some of the greatest character development in Film History.The Film, completely in black and white, asks a very important question. Should someone be guilty because of a stereotype? The Film deeply explores the questions that come up about stereotypes, and how stereotyping can make someone choose a bad decision. The film shows how prejudice is a lethal trait, and how holding onto the past can make you make bad decisions in the present.12 Angry Men deserves all the praise it can get, and if you disliked it the first time, I recommend a second viewing, and watch out for character development and how prejudice affects decisions.",12 Angry Men

And the last scene just feels like a cathartic breath, like the city itself has new life.A great film. Not exactly the most groundbreaking, but the acting was just phenomenal. Maybe a bit overacted at times, but the yells of frustration felt real and the dialogue smooth.All of it culminating in a film with an important, human message at a time in history when prejudice was still very pronounced.",12 Angry Men
404,axsmashcrushallthree,Close to a classic,9,27 May 2006,"In my continuing quest of watching IMDb's top-rated films, I rented ""12 Angry Men"". Currently, this film is ranked #18 on the list. With names like Reginald Rose, Henry Fonda, and Sidney Lumet, the movie seemed very promising. ""12 Angry Men"" was also another example of bringing yet another well-received teleplay to the big screen, as had been done very successfully with Rod Serling's ""Patterns"" and Paddy Chayevsky's ""Marty"".Others here eloquently provide detail on the plot and characters. Simply put, the movie is filmed almost entirely on a single set, the jury holding room of a courthouse, where a jury of 12 men are deliberating the fate of a young man accused of murder.Many plays and musicals have been adapted for the screen and the list of failures is long. A notable recent example for me was ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead"". Film viewers do not have the same expectations of a presentation as do theater viewers. In film, the expectation of greater variety and coloration is a prerequisite due to the viewer's previous experiences. Therefore, the danger of becoming ""stagebound"" can ruin a film's reception. For a play such as ""12 Angry Men"" where the focus is declamatory, this is an unavoidable danger.Happily, I found the film to be a resounding success. The strength of Rose's adaptation is complemented by Lumet's probing camera, which delineates the characters not only through impressive tight-focus shots, but through body language, gesture, and facial expression. The ensemble acting, underpinned by Henry Fonda's performance, is superb, as one would expect with such brilliant character actors as Lee J. Cobb, E. G. Marshall, and Ed Begley Sr. The storyline moves propulsively to a logical but powerful conclusion.I can't really think of any flaws. Some confrontations involving prejudicial statements are a bit obvious, but are unfortunately as relevant today as then.I wouldn't rate this as #18 on my list - I found the aforementioned ""Patterns"" to be a more engrossing film - but it's undoubtedly close to a classic. Kudos to all - I give it a 9.",12 Angry Men
405,kikoydaba3,A timeless classic relevant in any time period,10,7 July 2019,"12 Angry Men is a timeless classic relevant in any time period. Set exclusively in a jury room, the film exceeds the four corners of its setting presenting themes with great depth and handle about politics, interpersonal relationship, prejudice, bias and hope. In the age of social media and instant news, the film asks us to question our personal thoughts and belief. The film is a cinematic triumph of logic over emotion.A story about 12 men sitting as jurors faced with a decision to deliver a verdict on an accused teenager, the jurors are locked as a single hold out, Juror 8, played by Henry Fonda votes not guilty. Against overwhelming odds, Juror 8 manages to convince another juror who proclaims it is not easy to stand alone from the ridicule of others. The film gradually reveals more questions as a guilty verdict beyond reasonable doubt is slowly eroded and each character's motivations is gradually revealed. Every juror presents his arguments but these all fall when reasonable doubt exists attacking the testimony as more and more jurors vote not guilty. Despite being confined to a single room, the film is nonetheless a thriller. The film slowly reveals that men are often dictated by emotion and not reason. Juror 3, played by Lee J. Cobb, is the main antagonist but is also at heart and the opposite end of the film's struggle between guilty and not guilty. The subplot of his relationship with his estranged son finds resolution when he becomes the final juror to vote not guilty from guilty. With a cast to envy portraying every imaginable human emotion, 12 Angry Men flawlessly treads its themes with character growth in a cathartic ending. Even its black and white color is a representation of the gray area people live in a prejudiced world.Ultimately, the film speaks about our everyday politics but also as a redemption and heroic tale against odds. 12 Angry Men will continue to be appreciated for generations to come and deserves its place among cinema's masterpiece.10/10",12 Angry Men
406,alexsnower,Henry Fonda+Sydney Lumet=Greatness,10,26 June 2021,"I love the films of Sydney Lumet, but this shines above all his other great films (The Network, Dog Day Afternoon, The Verdict, etc). Henry Fonda does a terrific job as the protagonist of the film. He is a level headed architect who is essentially forced to convince the other men of the defendants innocence. Through this we meet our antagonist (Lee J Cobb). A man who allowed personal bias to get into the way of a fair trial. A man that Fonda's character is able to make look foolish over and over. A character who is described as a ""Sadist"" and a ""Public Avenger"". Lee J Cobb always plays a good villain that's for sure. This maybe even better than his performance in ""On the Waterfront"". Being confined in the jurors room for all but 3 minutes gives the film a sort of claustrophobia that works perfectly. Not to mention it is the hottest day of the year and all the men are sweating. It certainly adds a bit of tension subtilly. Nothing but great things to say about this gem of a movie. Please watch if you haven't seen.",12 Angry Men

408,snsh,too dated,7,13 October 2008,"The film 12 Angry Men might have been very good cinema for 1957, but in the 21st century it doesn't make a whole lot of sense.The movie wears you down while characters spend more time bickering about bickering than actually going over testimony and evidence. It's like the Blair Witch Project, where the characters act loud and annoying, beating the audience into exhaustion. The characters in 12 Angry Men mostly argue with each other, often screaming, making the resolution more gratifying to the audience. It's a common trick.*begin spoiler alert* Maybe we've gotten spoiled watching too much Monk and CSI and Law & Order, but as a legal drama the movie is confusing anyway. There's no discussion of blood trails or spatters. The defendant claimed there was a hole in his pants, but no pants were reviewed as evidence. Davis introduced a knife he bought as evidence in the jury room, which you can't do. The jury determined that the witness was nearsighted based on her nose. The jury decided a witness was incapable of running based on how he walked. The jury never discussed who else might have committed the murder. The thought-process behind the plot is so convoluted, it makes the whole movie frustrating to watch. *end spoiler alert*The movie is OK for 11 year olds so certainly carries a lot of nostalgic value 60 year olds, but it's flawed and doesn't hold up as a timeless film.",12 Angry Men

411,Stefan_Loves_Movies,Masterpiece or Flawed?,8,8 November 2021,"12 Angry Men (1957) is a thrilling Crime/Drama, currently rated top 5 best movies on IMDB. The film is relatively short 1h36m running time, with a beautifully acted, entertaining story. ""12 Angry Men"" has different ratings based on what you consider the movie being about:1. If you consider it about the Power of Persuasion, then this movie is good. Juror 8 managed to persuade everybody by providing an explanation for all their arguments.2. But if you consider it about right and wrong then the movie is flawed. Let me explain: If you follow Juror 8's logic, then no matter the evidence presented, he will always find a very IMPROBABLE explanation for it.*Follow my narrative for a sec: ""Let's try to come up with compelling evidence that would most likely incriminate the boy. Let's say the boy was taped killing his own father and 100 eyewitnesses are confirming the scene. This is unquestionable evidence, but Juror 8 could come up and say that the tape can be fake and that the eyewitnesses come from an organization and lied on purpose.""
This is very improbable, but there is a 1 % chance this could happen. This theory might get him at best another trial, but this doesn't mean that the boy is not guilty. If courts would use Juror 8's logic, no one would ever be found guilty! Therefore I don't agree with the conclusion of the story.All in all, I think everybody should watch at least once 12 Angry Men (1957) and see for themselves where they stand.",12 Angry Men

The acting is what makes this movie such a great one, Henry Fonda as the lone dissenter is magnificent, as are the rest of the jurors, particularly Lee J Cobb as the infamous volatile emotionally unstable juror number 3 and E.G Marshall as the cool and rational juror number 4 who judges on facts.

416,Tecun_Uman,"A Scathing Indictment on the Criminal Justice System, and One Hell of a Great Movie",10,2 January 2009,"The one reality of this film is that the kid probably did kill his father. Yes, Fonda's character is very skilled at manipulating the facts in the jury room, which does create enough reasonable doubt in the minds of a confused jury. Fonda truly does have the ""soft sell."" Of course, Fonda's acts should have been carried out by the public defender who was representing the kid, if they had, the district attorney could have countered all of them. But the fact that the public defender did such a poor job, it ends up actually handicapping the prosecution. Everything in the jury room is left to speculation, because it could not be fully uncovered in the court room. All of the points made by Fonda could have easily been addressed and most likely shot down by the DA. If anything, they could have been explored. I think this movie speaks towards the poor defense that most poor/minorities get when their lives are turned over to public defenders that are working 10 cases at one time. This is after all a Warren Era case. In the end, we have a jury trial, in which the Prosecution presents an open and shut case. The defense is too incompetent to make one valid argument for not guilty. However, the case gets re-argued in the jury room, by twelve amateurs that don't really have all the information they need to properly asses the facts of the case. The reality is, that if the kid had had a good defense attorney, he would have been found guilty. But the bad job done by his ill-prepared attorney created the perfect conditions for one juror to raise reasonable doubt. Now, if that is not an indictment against our criminal justice system, I don't know what is.",12 Angry Men

420,cmcastl,Legal philosophiser to appeal to any intelligent person,10,1 March 2017,"There are, that I know of, two legal systems, the Anglo-Saxon adversarial system and the French system. The French system has judge and jury as paid legal officials. The idea behind that is that trained and experienced legal officials at all stages of the process can deliver a better verdict. But the weakness is that such a system is more open to political corruption. In the English system there is judge, jury - made up of ordinary people who are drafted - and barristers. With some tweaks, the American system follows the British system.Which is the better? An un-answerable question but a fascinating one. I have always thought there is a moral ambiguity at the heart of this film. The number of genuinely decent, intelligent, educated and well-meaning jurors seems to be outweighed by the number of bigoted, prejudiced, mentally lazy and ill-educated ones. In the latter category, what psychologists today call those affected by 'motivated reasoning', made founding US father Alexander Hamilton distrustful of pure democracy and hence his electoral college to elect the President. So this film is a powerful disquisition on both the Anglo-Saxon jury system and democracy. Actually, any legal system is intimately a reflection of the political system. The moral core of the film is Henry Fonda, of course, whom Republicans today would call a 'bleeding-heart liberal'; certainly some of the characters in the film called him that more or less literally so that conservative pejorative labelling is not new. His willingness to give the young defendant, accused of killing his father, in what some of the jurors lazily called an 'open and shut' case, what you Americans call a 'fair shake' is what drives the plot. Then other jurors, better intentioned, rally to his standard and others less enlightened subsequently rally to his standard, as most people do to a true leader, one of his persuasive qualities and of his quality of character, if only to follow the tide of loyalty.One of the jurors calls Henry Fonda's character an exponent of the soft-sell. But that plain-Joe juror doesn't understand the difference between selling marmalade, which is the latter's job, and intelligence allied to a genuine conscience, which are the hall-mark qualities of Henry Fonda's 'architect' persona.Solon, the ancient Greek lawgiver, was once asked what would it take for justice to come into this world. He replied that justice would only come into this world if enough people who did not suffer injustice would feel for those who did. We are not there yet. In any film, play or novel a successful one is one in which all the leading characters are well-rounded and you feel that if you met them on the street you would recognise them immediately. This the film amply fulfills. Apart from anything else, the film is a master-class in top American actors of the late fifties.I would certainly like a Henry Fonda character on my jury if I ever faced murder in the first degree. But the curious thing is, the curious thing is, that on reviewing the evidence as it is presented in the film and despite the attempt at rebuttal which is the agenda of this film, I think the evidence stacked more against the defendant than for him! But I repeat, I would surely pray for a Henry Fonda character on my jury. One of the characters in the Sidney Lumet's excellent 'The Verdict', (1982) a wise old black doctor, (I likee how it was so aptly described as a 'legal Rocky') consoles Paul Newman's lawyer with the sentence that juries can sometimes surprise one in the rightness of their verdict.

424,Bryan_Roderick,Best Ensemble Cast Ever,9,2 July 2016,"12 Angry MenWritten by Reginald Rose and directed by Sidney Lumet. 12 Angry Men is about a jury who starts off 11-1 for guilty of a murder case. It's up to Juror #7 to show reasonable doubt. The film is an ensemble cast with great direction. Wide shots inside a jury room allow for whatever the main focus of the shot to also include the acting of others behind or along side. Continuous acting, and if in the hands of a different director like say Scorsese or Spielberg, I would have imagined one long 90 minute take.Juror #7 played by Henry Fonda, best know for The Grapes of Wrath and Once Upon a Time in the West, is the main holdout who goes on to try and convince the other jurors who have their reasons to think he's guilty. Some are just going along with the crowd, some have personal issues, and some just aren't convinced. Fonda does a great job acting as an every man with some doubt. Juror #1 played by Martin Balsam, best known for Breakfast at Tiffany's and Psycho, is the person who is in charge of voting and for the most part keeps his opinions to himself. Juror #3 played by Lee J. Cobb, best known for The Exorcist, is by far the most interesting if not most stubborn character in the film. He yells, is arrogant, and has it in his mind that the boy murdered his father. It's not until the final minutes of the film that you get to know more about his character, but boy is it worth it.Juror #7 played by Jack Warden, best known for All the President's Men, but I first saw him in Problem Child as Big Ben. He plays a baseball fan that just wants to get out of the room as soon as possible so he can go see a ball game. It was great seeing him throw in little chimes every now and then as jabs towards the other jurors opinions causing more...anger. See title.This film lost three Oscars to The Bridge on the River Kwai. A movie that's now on my to see list. With it's wonderful acting it only makes me want to see the other more. Verdict: Best ensemble cast movie I've ever seen. For a movie that doesn't change location, it has surpassed Reservoir Dogs and Saw. That means a lot. Go rent/buy this film.",12 Angry Men
425,stathisvoukelatos,"Flawless,unique masterpiece",9,8 October 2012,"12 Angry Men is a unique,remarkable film for a lot of reasons.One reason is the flawless direction from -one of the best directors of all time- Sidney Lumet.Another thing is the exceptional acting from all the juries,the simple yet superb plot and of course the fact that in the 96-minute-long film ,93 minutes of it take place in one and only set!But what makes 12 Angry Men truly exceptional is the deep psychological analysis and presentation of all the 12 juries.One could say that every jury is an allegory,a symbolism of a human being's type of personality,but looking at it that way,it seems that anybody is as different with anybody as the same .The only thing that determines is the experience that one has.The film also is so powerful that you can't but put yourself in the place of the one that decides.Could you decide about another man's life? And who makes you responsible?Is the law just?These are just a few reasons that 12 Angry Men is simply one of the best films of all time,and probably the psychologically deepest -maybe along with One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest- one.",12 Angry Men

It is not because it's in black and white. It is because the setting is in one room. The majority of the movie is just in one room with the characters. This is definitely not a movie that uses special effects and other over the top props to make it engaging. What does make it engaging is the dialogue and performances by the characters. The majority of the movie is just these 12 men trying to make a verdict if a boy is guilty or not of a crime. At first, 11 of them all said he is totally guilty. But then one man wasn't to quick to judge and wants to argue it further. This then carries the rest of the movie so well and we learn a lot about these 12 men just arguing about the judgement of guilty or not guilty against an accused boy. The overall message which is still prevalent to today which is ""Don't judge until you get all the facts and have thought about the implications."" The writing and characters is all this movie needs to be good. Other movies could learn a lot from this one.",12 Angry Men
427,ThatAnimeSnob,all it took is 1 room and 12 people to create one of the best movies I ever watched in my life,9,19 March 2013,"For a film that takes place almost entirely in one room and is mostly made up of dialogues, I must say it was a blast. Although the premise may sound completely boring for most people, the context in it surpasses most of everything out there. In a way it is a detective story that takes place in a confined room and where all evidence are based solely on speculations and thin reasoning. Through means of possibilities, deduction, and doubt, 12 men are supposed to decide the fate of a young man accused of killing his own father. Although the case seems crystal clear at first, as all the evidence prove his guilt, a single shred of doubt is more than enough to begin a long line of second thoughts and complicating debates. Anyone who loves intelligent disputes and exposed lines of thought behind anything will definitely be mesmerized by its attention to detail. What makes the movie even more enjoyable is how its characters are not emotionless orthologists or cynical businessmen. Each one of them has a very distinctive personality and his judgment is usually affected by his life experiences and personal bias towards certain social issues. You will see hints of racism, hatred for youngsters, snobing of the poor, even some who don't care and just want to get over with it soon so they can go watch a baseball match. An extra element that adds to its magnificence is how it is using its laws of that time as well as various details of the society it takes place in. You are constantly given various information regarding law specifics, and cultural events, so you are really made to believe the story takes place in an American state of the 50's. Something which is very important when it comes to any story regarding trials or detective work, since without them one would wonder why wouldn't they just use some fancy CSI method to determine if he really did it (which was impossible at that time) or why are thy even using common people to determine if a man is guilty or not (which happens in very few parts in the world). The interesting thing is that we are never actually told if the accused man really did the crime or not; that is not the objective of the movie. It is more about following the logic behind the use of a jury to determine the lives of others, as well as how reasonable doubt is more than enough to let someone go free if you are not certain he did it. This would of course mean that lots of people are found not-guilty even when they really did it, but that is not what the movie is all about. It has more to do with upholding the laws of a state in their fullest and in this case they really were. There are still a few things that annoyed me in the movie, even if they are completely excused for their time and era. The whole film is made up of only white males. Not a single woman or member of a different race. Although the 60's were indeed like that, in a sense it feels kinda racist. That is why I like the 90's remake even more in overall. Although it does not have superstars protagonist in it, it is with color, the characters are behaving in a more natural way (not that wooden feeling of the old movies), there are black members in the jury, the accused is a latino, and the judge is a woman. And despite the 30 year gap, the laws are still used in almost the same way (with only a few minor details presented differently just to adjust to the era) and thus the plot is presented in exactly the same way. Not that it's feels like much of a problem; it s still an amazing piece of cinema and worthy to be part of most top 10 movie lists with similar categories.",12 Angry Men

430,woinaroschy_1979,12 angry men - masterpiece,10,9 November 2010,"This movie shows how you can make a film on the lowest budget possible, with only one or two scene sets and 12 good actors. Basically the whole movie takes place in one room where a jury of 12 men discuss their verdict for a young man suspected of killing his father. Reading the lines above you might think this is a boring movie, but the plot unfolds, as only one man of the jury is not convinced that the boy is guilty and slowly begins to convince the other members of the jury of his doubt. The story becomes at times a detective story, the jury trying to put together missing pieces of the murder puzzle. This movie shows in a marvelous simple way the mechanism of the justice system, how easily a man can be convicted to the death sentence based on prejudice, subjective declarations of witnesses and an unprofessional defense lawyer. It stresses out the importance of declaring someone ""not guilty"" if there is a reasonable doubt in your mind about his guilt. It shows that you should always ask questions and not accept everything on first hand.Besides these simple, yet profound ideas, there is a solid acting from everyone of those 12 jury members. Each is unique in his way, with his own personality,history and background. There is the typical immigrant, the wise guy cracking up jokes, the mediator, the wise old man, the educated man with stiff views of the world, the geek, the self-made man who did not forget where he came from, the choleric, the prejudiced man, the stupid guy who does not give a damn about this trial but only about getting to his football game in time. They don't have names, in fact there is no name mentioned until the very last scene in the movie, each jury member just has a number, yet you distinguish them very easily just by their personality. Some are given more screen time, some less, but they all do some marvelous acting. Last, but not least, the camera and directing! Can I just say, for a movie taking place in one room, it's really amazing...stressing out gestures, faces of people, objects to give depth to the scenes. I'll never forget the scene where one jury member just tries to convince the others of the young boy's guilt, because ""these people (living in slums) are born this way and they do these things, they're violent, they're animals"" and one by one, the jury members leave the table, the place of dialog and go to other corners of the room, signaling that they do not wish to continue this conversation. Or the scene where they do a re-enactment of an old man trudging along to reach his front door. Truly, a masterpiece, I recommend it to anyone anytime! 10/10",12 Angry Men

432,SanTropez_Couch,In the Room,10,28 February 2003,"The story of this film is famous: one man tries to convert the 11 other jurors in a jury room. Superficially, that's all the film is. And it works magnificently on this level alone. But mixed in with that one notion (which is, I should say, remarkably carried out), we've got sprinklings of messages. What democracy really means, the notion of a fair and just trial, the stupidity of racism, etc.At the opening of the film, we're inside the courtroom (everything but the opening and closing -- maybe  120 seconds in total -- takes place within the jury room and its adjacent bathroom) and the judge seems blasé about the jury. ""Just go in and do your thing...whatever."" It's just another case with a fairly predictable outcome, he thinks (we assume). He reminds the jury that their conclusion must be unanimous and as they walk into the jury room, a few of them take a glance at the man on trial and the camera shows his face, looking at his only hope to save him from the chair (he's on trial for murder one).As the jurors file into the jury room, over the credits, we see Juror #8 (Henry Fonda), who seems uninterested, looking out the window. The others are mostly talking about simply being in a jury room but Fonda is actually thinking about the case. He's slow to move, contemplative. Juror #7 (Jack Warden) is anxious to get out to his baseball game he's got tickets for.There has been talk, like Roger Ebert's, of how the camera starts out at an elevation and slowly comes down by the end of the film. I didn't notice that, but I did notice just how creative the camera does move about in a very constricted space. I don't think it's ever in exactly the same place, at the same angle.The first jury count, of course, has them at 11 to one, in favor of guilty. What makes this film great is that the lone man who says not guilty, Fonda, isn't sure the young man on trial is innocent -- he's just not sure he's guilty.The straight racism of Juror #10 (Ed Begley) is obvious and the film deals with it. I don't know what the times were like in 1957, but I would have assumed that the order of the day may be to bring racial issues up but not deal with them directly. This film does and it comes out on the right side. The film isn't dated at all in its politics. If it were made today (I haven't seen the TV remake, although with a cast that has George C. Scott and Jack Lemmon, I'd like to), Juror #10 may be less obvious a racist, but this is a minor, if even, a complaint. There are still people like him, who'd believe that murder is inborn to specific ethnicities. What's sort of funny is that I couldn't tell what the man on trial was. Maybe Italian or Greek.We get a good sense of each of the jurors, and indeed by the end we could probably list them off by their number (they never really say names, it's usually, ""Hey, you there""). Part of this is due to that amazing camera. It really lets us know these people and it doesn't cut back to the ""overview shot"" or something so we can just get a good look at everyone together. When there is a wide shot that shows the entire room, some jurors are up walking, getting a drink, one may be in the bathroom. It's not a condescending camera that says, ""Here's everyone. We'll give you some time to get all of them straight.""The entire film -- aside from those estimated 120 seconds -- is shot in real time, or as close to real time as you can come without making a film with one continuous, unbroken shot. Within the jury room there are no edits for time lapses, just for cutting to a different angle or juror.The film acknowledges how evidence is all subjective (""There's a difference between a slap and a punch.""). Each juror saw the same thing in the courtroom (we hear the evidence and the case only through the jurors recollections) but comes out with something different. That's part of what makes movies in themselves great: we all see the same movie and, when one is good, we all leave with something else, specific to us.Fonda is the leader in the film, almost made into a holy figure. He's passive in the beginning and he's the one who presents the other jurors with his feelings as to why the young man may not be guilty. That's what Fonda does, brilliantly. He talks out his feelings. He's not in possession of some scientific fact that he plans on systematically informing the jury of, he just needs to take some time to sort out the facts, as he heard them, in his mind. Of course he's noticed things the others haven't and he's given the case more thought than maybe most would have. But it isn't a one-man mission. By being the one to stand up, he lets the others come out and say what they've seen. He gives them the chance to think and feel things over. While Fonda is obviously the protagonist, the film doesn't shy away from fairly showing other considered theories of those who are against him. At first Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb) is the common sense antagonist, but later Juror #4 (E.G. Marshall) has intelligent deductions as to why Fonda is wrong.All of the technicalities of the film are fine. The acting is first-rate -- I was especially interested in Juror #9 (Joseph Sweeney), who's made into an almost goofy old man with a strange way of showing his untold wisdom. And I now understand why Henry Fonda appealed to so many. Lee J. Cobb is terrific as the easily angered brute who isn't quite that simple. The picture on the DVD was incredibly crisp.This is the type of movie they should show in American History classes. Hell, show it in any country (like mine, Canada) where democratic notions are held dear. In this room there is a microcosm of judicial, political, and human existence. A masterwork.****",12 Angry Men
433,verbal_666,Truth does not exist,8,7 November 2021,"This film is a masterpiece. I've seen it at least a dozen times, and every time it's more and more beautiful! It is not a treatise on how to discover the truth, on the contrary ... the truth often does not exist, except in those who have actually carried out certain actions, but Justice, in almost the whole world, is based precisely on trying to get as close to the truth as possible. Very often this approach is horrible, as we have seen many cases of acquittal, as there is the classic ""reasonable doubt"", and it is precisely here that the authors take us. The truth does not exist, even the Juror 8 repeatedly says so, the fate of many men and women is linked to a very thin thread, which other men and women have to decide whether to cut or not. Justice, when addressed in any film or novel, is a very hot topic (see O. J. Simpson or Robert Durst, but there will be hundreds of them we don't know), because it involves so many variables. I believe that this film must be seen and analyzed by anyone who approaches the subject of Justice, whether it is his job or a ""normal"" juror or citizen who wants to judge!",12 Angry Men

I love movies and all types. 12 Angry Men should be watched by everyone over 20 years of age. The older you are the more you appreciate it. This black and white film lends to the effects like so many of the other great films from before 1960. Henry Fonda has always reminded me of my father, especially in his mannerisms throughout this film. I feel sorry for those under 20, because they probably have never heard of this movie, but for those who have, it will open them up to many others. Every generation (including mine, HS class of '71)believes that their parents don't understand them. I was definitely no different. But, I was fortunate enough to watch these earlier films so I have developed a strong bond with them. If you have just seen this movie for the first time, may I suggest reviewing and watching some of the AFI's top 100 films of all time.

435,RagingDraugr,"A courtroom drama (mostly) without the courtroom, and yet firmly establishes itself within the canon of 'Courtroom cinema' with gusto.",10,19 September 2018,"'12 Angry Men' manages to accomplish what very few films manage to do: make a successful, engaging film that plays out almost entirely within one room. For the vast majority of the run-time, the film takes place entirely within four small walls. And the fact that it manages to accomplish so much with those walls should be praise in and of itself.Firstly, the plot is exceptional - a murder trial. The defendant, a boy who is assumed to have killed his father in an emotional outburst. If he's found guilty by the 'angry men', he gets the electric chair. The details of this case are quickly thrown into suspicion by Fonda, and from there, it's a snowball of confusion that casts a long shadow of doubt over the jury's proceedings - leading from an (almost) unanimous vote of 'guilty' to a completely unanimous vote of 'not guilty'. This flip feels completely natural and logical, due to the clever writing. In addition, due to the tightness of the plotting, the pacing of the film was consistently strong. The cleverness of the writing also applies in many other areas such as with Lee J. Cobb's character - a man who, at the film's climax, is revealed to have imposed his own furious and frustrated feelings towards his own son upon the defendant. In fact, the writing helps to distinguish each character effectively, giving each instantly recognisable character traits: Henry Fonda's character is calm but unsure, Lee J. Cobb's character is excitable and probably the most angry out of the 12, Jack Warden's character is lazy and a slouch (and so on and so on...). Many of the characters' actions also highlighted particular social prejudices (e.g. suggesting that, because he grew up in a slum, he was given to violence), that hint at how much of an effect past experience has on a decision - and how no decision, especially one as important as deciding the life of a young man, is ever truly unbiased (as shown distinctly by Lee J. Cobb's character, as mentioned above). And of course, all the nuances of this writing are demonstrated and carried by fantastic performances across the board by all the actors.As stated previously, the film does indeed take place almost entirely within the jury room with only three short scenes outside of it: inside the courthouse, inside the courtroom and outside the courthouse. But what keeps the room from feeling stagnant is the cinematography, which is fantastic throughout with clever use of blocking (i.e. An actor's moves in relation to the camera) and interesting, varied angles and shot compositions - one moment, two actors are looking out a window discussing elements of the case and then, in one swift dolly move, we're now focused back on the table and the rest of the group. The blocking also further accentuated each character's movements and idiosyncrasies, which in combination with the writing, also elevated the characters more and more. Considering the quality of the writing, the pacing, the acting, the cinematography and the blocking, there's very little to truly criticise '12 Angry Men' for - except for maybe one thing: the score was forgettable, but it wasn't used much anyway, so definitely more of a nitpick than a real criticism.If you're going to watch one great courtroom drama film in your lifetime, make it the one that helped to define the genre (and also make it the one that doesn't even unfold inside of a courtroom).",12 Angry Men

Pardon me for writing these many superlatives but this film is a classic Masterpiece in the true sense of the word. I absolutely loved it! The movie has one of the most simple plots and only runs for an hour and 36 minutes. It is predominantly shot in a single room and its in Black and White{released way back in the year 1957}.

What follows is the greatest and maybe the longest conversation in a film I've ever seen. You won't believe how different and unique these 12 men are.Juror#1 : A guy who appears confused and tries to calm everyone else around him so that they can reach to a conclusive verdict. Juror#2 : A shy person who doesn't speak his mind but understands the situations.Juror#3 : A dominant personality who appears very firm and a successful businessman.Juror#4 : The most logical of all.Juror#5 : A young man from a violent slum who maybe understands the boy's situation the best.Juror#6 : A well built man, principled and respectful.Juror#7 : A sports fan who doesn't care much.Juror#8 : An architect who deeply thinks about the case.Juror#9 : {I liked all the characters but the most interesting was this one} A wise old man whose experience speaks for himself.Juror#10 : A foul mouthed and an aggressive person.Juror#11 : An immigrant watchmaker and a supporter for the justice.Juror#12 : An advertising executive who likes to be with the majority.As someone had commented before ""If you ever see only one Black and White film make it this one""...Rightly said.

440,nitratestock35,values,10,11 June 2003,"Of course Twelve Angry Men is about the legal system in the US. Of course it is considered ""artsy"" in part since it is low budget and filmed in black and white.But above all it is cinema that has the three basic ingredients of what makes a great movie: a good screenplay, great actors and impeccable photography. Cinema started as filmed theater and IMHO any film should be aware of its origins. As soon as a movie denies its origins totally and turnes into a computer generated roller coaster ride, I don't like it.
I don't say all films should play in just one room. But the ""real time"" feel should be explored much more often in movies. Hitchcock did it with ""Rope"" and I think he did it excellently. Twelve Angry Men is based upon a television play. These were transmitted live (!!!) back in the 1950s because the video tape didn't exist back then - so we can speak of theater. The movie itself has very much the same feel to it. I like the interactiveness between the actors and the ""modern theater performance"" used back then. In recent movies we can see all too often an actor caring about his/her facial expressions when filmed and caring about the voice at the studio dubbing stage. In this film everything what you see and what you hear looks 100% natural. I am especially overwhelmed by the values transmitted by the main characters. Honest Hank (Henry Fonda) is of course the most likeable character. E.G. Marshall stands out as well. But it's the great, late Lee J. Cobb who runs away with the movie in his final scene.

And that is due largely in part to its acting performances. Never would I have thought I would ever feel tension just from the use of dialogue, but '12 Angry Men' proved me wrong showing that if you have a good plot and a good script, then you can make a quality film without the use of large sets, car chases, gun shots, and beautiful scenery shots.There was never one moment in this film where I was not paying attention. One reason I can give for this is the distinctiveness of each and every character. What I love is how every juror is different from one another hailing from many different backgrounds. Just listening to these guys talk made me want to get to know everyone of them and what their motives were and how it would affect the outcome of the story. As the story progresses, you get more and more immersed as things start to get tense and personal in situation in which extreme rationalization is required in using reasonable doubt.What also makes this film rewarding is that you feel like one of the jurors and it makes you want to think just as hard as they're thinking about the case. There are twists and turns here and this is not a simple case to analyze when everything is not pure black and white. When we're only presented with very few details, we can only look to the unseen details that could give us a strong reason to doubt a person(s)' accusations. This is a story that is universal and how reasonable doubt must be taken into all accounts when there is blurred line between who is right or wrong and who is good or bad.",12 Angry Men

446,mr composer,"Wonderful screenplay, great acting.",10,30 September 2001,"Talk about a simple film!  12 guys as jurors are in one room for all but maybe 3 minutes of the film.  In 90+ minutes, they talk through the details of the murder case, some aforementioned in the courtroom and some underlooked, to either determine a verdict - which must be unanimous or else the trial is ""hung.""The fact of a unanimous vote being required makes the foundation for a very gripping film.  However, with no visual flashbacks or anything, if one is going to be successful for a film with such a monotonous setting, some guidelines are required.  1. The running time must not be overlong.  At some point, we'd feel as frustrated as some of the jurors. 2. The screenplay must be first-rate.  and 3. The acting must be believable.This film passes all three criteria with flying colors.  The running time is barely over 90 minutes, ample time to throughly develop every idea.  The script was great!  The details of the case are thought out wonderfully.  And the character development: It's amazing what you learn about all 12 men, without learning their names!  While I won't reveal the outcome, I will say that the way the momentum swings is almost like watching a football game or something. The final point about the screenplay (as well as the acting) is that it's all very believable.  It sounds like a conversation I might expect to encounter in 1957 in a jury room.  Even in 2001, however, the substance of the movie is still valid.  The situation in real-life still occurs.One final thing about the acting.  While all 12 men did great performances, I am continually amazed by Henry Fonda.  He is one of the few men of his time I have seen fit each role he plays to a tee.. without ever overacting.In summary, this is a movie that very deserving of the praise it receives.",12 Angry Men

It wasn't. That made me mad.Don't believe me? Just google, The ""True story"" that 12 Angry Men writer claimed inspired the classic film is revealed as a work of pure fiction"". Yes, that's right pure fiction.College professors are making generations of students watch this crappy movie proclaiming how wonderful it is and how corrupt our system is.If you still want to believe this b.s. Movie and still think 12 Angry Men is real, then watch Star Trek. It's is a great documentary about NASA. Also, XFiles is a good documentary about scientific research.Yes, it's irritating my English teacher and Political Science Professor both raved about this movie. They thought it was based on a real case. It's been used for generations to prove institutional corruption, and to smugly lecture the unwashed about righteousness in an unfair world. We've written papers and shaped our opinions about the world based on the lies found in Hollywood.I now see this movie for what it is. Something a Hollywood liberal used to get famous. A self righteous bully becomes a hero forcing a jury to disregard evidence. It's a cynical patronizing movie. It's a chance for Fonda to act important .Yes, it has some famous actors, and they're all legendary. But it's credibility and luster is gone. It's the cookie left out for Santa that was really eaten by your dad.

448,knutsenfam,Great actors; somewhat preachy script; still worth watching,7,25 August 2005,"I won't repeat the details of the plot as many comments above summarize the plot and even the 12 jurors in depth...Briefly, Fonda's character challenges the rest of the 12 man jury to take time to reexamine the evidence before they send a very young man to the mandatory death sentence. A fair challenge. Even tho the case (as one juror argues ) seem so ""open and shut"".Here, the best thing about the film (to me) is the use of logic. Why? As the 12 men examine each bit of proof, they discover several possible logical flaws or false assumptions. Sound too dry? Not the way it is presented.My criticism is that Fonda's character is just too perfect, too right and (for most of the movie) too free from perspiration, unlike the rest in that hot jury room. Fonda early questions some jurors as to whether there's any possibility for error. If he said ""It's possible"" one more time, I was going to scream. (I remember various evil characters getting off on slim technicalities...! ) But fortunately, his questioning leads others to question evidence and to find REAL doubt that the testimony, etc. is valid.Their use of logic to pick out the evidentiary flaws is fascinating. Thus, this is still an excellent movie worth watching!",12 Angry Men
449,ProperCharlie,Theatre of justice,8,5 September 2005,"There are some films that are acknowledged classics of one degree or another. Whether it be a technical aspect such as cinematography or something less tangible such as emotional content or a gripping narrative, some stand out. 'Twelve Angry Men' is one such film, mostly noted for the amazing acting performances from a large cast in one room. They have few props and one main set. The stage for twelve actors to show their stuff. And show it they do.This film works as a pure stage play on the screen. All twelve actors step up to the plate. The writing is immaculate making the complex inter-relationships between the twelve work believably and never letting the pace slacken. It's tense and taut. The points being made aren't always subtle, but they're never hammered home. Keeping twelve characters involved in a story while keeping it moving along is a tough task for a writer. All of them want to have their say so you don't forget them, all of them have to show what their character is, yet none of them must be allowed to dominate. Reginald Rose deserves immense plaudits for what he achieved here.There is a political message here. To some it may be obvious, to others it may be unpalatable. You may call it propaganda, yet unlike a lot of more modern propagandists, this doesn't solely preach to the converted. This is one to think on for everyone. It's important that even at the end, the viewer doesn't know what really happened the night of the crime. Did they save an innocent from the chair or did they let a killer walk free? It asks questions, says where its loyalties lie but doesn't claim that the issues are black and white. A truly unusual standpoint and one I would welcome more of in film.Perhaps one of the notable aspects that isn't much commented on about 'Twelve Angry Men' is the oddly un-filmic qualities it has. As previously mentioned it moves like a stageplay rather than screenplay. The look is reminiscent of a TV production including the sans-serif credits underneath the actors faces, and the simple studio set. This hasn't prevented its strengths propelling it into a slot as one of the best and best loved movies of all time.",12 Angry Men

The characters makes you look at everything about the case thoroughly. Henry Fonda really sways you toward believing the accused is innocent. Even with the convincing evidence at hand his character really thinks about each and every possibility pertaining to the case at hand and makes a convincing plea for the defendant.

454,b_havag,Outstanding movie in all ways,9,13 January 2009,"""12 Angry Men"" is an outstanding achievement. Why? Like in the movie, I'm gonna tell you why I think so:1.It's from 1957, it's old. (Many, mostly young, people find this negative. 2.It's in black and white (Even more doesn't even bother to try and see such movies) 3.It has a very simple plot. 4.It's shot almost entirely in a single room. 5.The budget's as low as 340.000 dollars (Citizen Kane, 16 years EARLIER had 690.000) 6.It was Sidney Lumets, the director, first movie. and 7.It consists almost entirely of dialogue.And STILL; The LOWEST average score is 7.8! (By girls under 18 of course)Throughout the feature, there is a great tension. There is so much we want to know, so much that fixes my eyes on the screen from the first minute until the end. Did the boy do it? Can number 8 convince the rest? Can he convince me? Who will be the next to have doubts? Will number 8 come up with more excellent deducing? This is the proof that great movies can be done with very small resources. All you need is a great plot and good actors. Astoundishing! 10/10",12 Angry Men

This director, showing maturity in his very first film, made a classic, one of the most acclaimed movies of all time, using twelve actors and a excellent script.In one of it's first scenes, where there was eleven jurors voting guilty, and only one voting non-guilty, I thought, ""It's impossible, there is no way that in only one room, a single man could convince eleven jurors that there was a reasonable doubt"", but fortunately there is, you'll see, this is the most important quality of this picture, otherwise everybody would be thinking, ""What a stupid idea that is, to make a movie in only one room, it's just boring"". It's not fair to review this movie without talking about the acting, with the help of the script, they made twelve different two-dimensional characters, and they represent all the different kind of people in the society, there is the grouchy, there is the one who only cares about himself, the wise old man and a lot more.This movie is for me the best example for me that action scenes and visuals effects are not at all, the most important element of great films, of course there are movies that think different than I do.Verdict: You can watch this movie ten times, and you will no find a reasonable doubt to not watch it again.",12 Angry Men

C'mon! Does anyone really believe that garbage, then or now?Slowly, Fonda tries to give defendant/punk every possible benefit of the doubt at every turn, though why? Evidence clearly shows punk was guilty (same knife, lies about his whereabouts, no one ELSE had a motive, etc.. One by one, jurors unfortunately cave in until he gets his wish of a ""not guilty"" verdict, turning an obvious patricidal maniac back onto the streets of New York. Hooray!In this era, people were already starting to make fun of social do-gooders (West Side Story: ""Our mothers are all junkies- are fathers all are drunks; goodness, gracious, naturally we're punks!""), and how absurd they were.I'll bet Fonda would have felt right at home on the O.J. jury.Though I didn't see this movie till I was in my forties, and Fonda was long gone, I was somehow hoping that punk who the jury freed would find Fonda on the subway platform, try to rob him, pull out his switchblade, and well, you know.Now THAT would have been some ending, and a just one too!",12 Angry Men

By the end of the movie, more then half my class loved it. I didn't like it as much. Earlier this year we had watched 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' starring James Stewart. I found that one much more enjoyable since the characters did more then just sit around a table and discussing if a young boy really did kill his father or not. The story was slow, with a few surprises here and there but nothing spectacular. Our government teacher told us it was one of the best movies ever, according to the movie critics of that time, but I would have to disagree with the critics. It was just okay.

463,SoftKitten80,Should be called 12 Wonderful Men - spoiler,10,10 February 2005,"This should be called 12 Wonderful Men because it is as fine a movie as any I've seen. They are 12 real pros who want to do a good job. I can't imagine directing 12 strong actors, I can't begin to imagine what a job that is. I had heard so much about Diner I thought Diner was going to be like this, and Diner couldn't do the job properly with four men, let alone 12. I got the impression that Martin Balsam was the big name in the movie and that the foreman role was considered one of the top billing ones, I don't know. I noticed his name was first on the credits, I didn't know if that was star power or some other order. The last shot was beautiful with good spatial relation, with a rainy day and people just walking along. Ordinary every day life, which is what I'm interested in and where I have the most fun. Well, glamorous things are fun too, but so are ordinary every day life things. The old man was fantastic, they all were. I had to take the movie in small doses, it was almost too much for one sitting. One of my favorite scenes is where someone drinks from a dixie cup, then crumples and throws it. It was all good, a fine movie that shows you how acting is done (Martin Balsam always shows you how it's done, and now there were a whole group of actors showing us).",12 Angry Men
464,dlpburke,Good Movie Ruined By Left Wing Bias and Smugness,1,8 October 2015,"12 Angry Men is entertaining, mostly well acted, and worth a watch. It could have been far better but, from the outset, the film was designed only to take a pot-shot at the Right, and promote a Left Wing Progressive viewpoint as the absolute truth. This story is hardcore propaganda and, judging by its score on IMDb, has succeeded in fooling a great number of people. What is interesting to me is that the Left-wing's brainwashing started this early. Hollywood is still churning out the same bias today (go and read my Dark Knight review).The movie has a very interesting premise: An open-and-shut case is called in to question when one man on the twelve-man jury slowly convinces the others that the eighteen year old on trial for the murder of his father may, in fact, be innocent. That's got some real potential, hasn't it? Sadly, the gone-in-the-head Leftist who wrote this did what I feared he would: loaded the dice and peddled a Leftist agenda - namely one that excuses criminals of their actions and seeks to end the death penalty. That's the film's overwhelming goal. It wants the audience to come away from the movie, not with a greater appreciation of the legal system, but with the view that the death penalty should be abolished and that anyone who objects to this is a deluded, little bigot. Let's look at the facts we are given:-Spoilers from here on- 1. An 18 year old is on trial for the murder of his father. He has no alibi. The alibi he gave to police (that he was in a theatre the whole time) fell apart when he could not recall anything about the movies that were showing - even their names.2. There are two main witnesses: One saw the defendant leaving the scene of the crime (and heard the event); the other saw the murder take place through a window and identified the defendant. The defendant was also heard shouting in anger 'I'm gonna kill you', the same day as the murder.3. The knife (with a very rare design) used in the murder is the same knife that the defendant had bought earlier and was carrying around. His friends testified to this effect.4. The defendant is an habitual criminal who has had numerous run-ins with the law, including two arrests for knife fighting. He is said to be 'real handy with a knife'.5. The defendant has a clear motive: His father was repeatedly violent and abusive towards him, and had beaten him regularly (with fists) since he was five years of age, including the day of the murder.I was intrigued. Why does this one juror believe the defendant may not be guilty? How could he convince the rest that there is reasonable doubt? Despite the fact I feared these questions would receive fob-offs, I was still hopeful an intelligent investigation would be crafted around them. But no. Straight away, the film deliberately loads the dice by having certain jurors holding prejudiced or otherwise undesirable traits, while the dissenting voice is calm, collected, and supremely open-minded. That's cliché, and a very common Leftist tactic (you'll see it a lot on shows like Star Trek).The film takes each of the facts above and finds an absurd alternate explanation for them, such as the knife could have fallen out of the defendants pocket and the true murderer used an identical knife (this is the fantastic explanation given by our Leftist hero). The film has a moronic moment where the 'hero' pulls out a knife he has bought (illegally), which appears identical to the one in question. The idea being that it isn't so rare, after all.Other silly moments include the jury discussing why the defendant would come home a few hours later if he had indeed done the crime. Not one of them mentions that the defendant lives there and would have to come back home in order to allay fears that he was the murderer. It's part of an alibi. What else is he going to do, disappear and hope that the police don't find that a tad suspicious? Nearly every explanation given in favour of the defendant is absurd or complete conjecture.When you string all the known facts together, the chances of them all being explained away in a fashion that exonerates the defendant is literally millions to one. It's so implausible that no sane jury would acquit. But the writer wants this to happen, so it does (and 12-0 in favour, just in case you missed the point). I love it when writers do that. Don't you? At one point, the following dialogue takes place:""No-one can know a thing like that; this isn't an exact science."" ""That's right, it isn't."" Okay, then, let's just forget putting people on trial because we can hardly ever be 100% sure that they did the crime in question, can we? The number of victims created by having no deterrent, or by allowing dangerous criminals to go free, is FAR GREATER than the absolute minority case where an innocent person is found guilty. Some people cannot be reasoned with and are far too broken to be rehabilitated. They are like a dangerous dog. We don't try to change the nature of a dangerous dog because we know it's futile, and we know that by ignoring it, we are just risking more innocent lives. This really isn't rocket science, it's just that the Leftist types (who have a huge stranglehold on the media/TV) refuse to budge, and muddy the waters with their insane Progressive agenda.People cheering this movie are cheering for a violent thug, who got away with first-degree murder. It's not hip, it's just dumb. Wake up.My rating: 3/5",12 Angry Men

466,StoryCharts,Everyone giving an honest effort to civic duty is a matter of life or death,5,24 July 2013,"12 Angry Men is about the idea that everyone giving an honest effort to civic duty is a matter of life or death. It sets out to prove this idea with two external plots: one plot chronicles the journey of finding reasonable doubt for a Not Guilty verdict, the other chronicles the jury gradually giving an honest effort to the deliberation process. The result of these two plots, both of which end in success, gives rise to the idea that without everyone giving an honest effort, the democratic process would be broken.The movie is a short, confined story tightly told. It is an important story since the idea at the heart of democracy is a delicate one: that all members of society are innocent until proved guilty and that they each have the right to be judged by their peers. That 12 random people from all walks of life are the ultimate arbiters of what are life and death judgement is scary and liberating at the same time. It's scary in that each of us is a bundle of individual prejudices and hardened views that can sway our judgement. It's liberating in that these 12 random people need to unanimously decide on a single judgement despite their inherent differences.The movie highlights the democratic process by showing 12 specific individuals who are too busy and prejudiced from the get go to give the judging process an honest go. When only one juror stands between a death verdict and a long uncomfortable debate, the democratic process is on the verge of breaking down. By the individual standing up against his peers to insist on an honest discussion, he starts the process towards due diligence and evidence review that ultimately results in an unanimous Not Guilty judgement.The idea that it only takes one individual out of twelve to have the resolve for giving an honest effort to civic duty is a powerful one. It is the idea that the foundation of democratic society can rest on a single individual taking their responsibilities seriously. In fact it is the only foundation democracy can rest on.So the movie is about an important idea.But the drama of the story gets slightly repetitive in the second half, as juror after juror deals with their own prejudice. The story tries to give each juror a backstory that reinforces their preconceived notions and views, but having to do this for 12 people dilutes their power and makes most of them seem stereotyped and caricatured.But thankfully the filmmakers keep the story moving in a tight 90 minutes and don't ruin a good thing.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca",12 Angry Men

469,Susie-7,Fantastic.,9,13 August 1999,"I am not big on watching old movies, for many reasons.  Black and white does not bother me, but the poor film quality and the cheesy special effects (like using iguanas with stuff taped to them for dinosaurs), when there are any, are very distracting.  However, my biggest problems, and really the only ones that prevents me from watching a lot of them, are the overacting and the hokey dialogue.  This movie is one of the few of its day that I have seen that does not suffer from these problems (the others being mainly Hitchcock films- there was never any hokeyness in those).  Instead, it is a great character study.  The dialogue is believable.  Really the only thing that makes this movie unrealistic if it were to be set in the present day is the absence of non-white jurors (of which the remake took care of) and of women (which the remake did not address).  Other than that, this movie could easily have been made in 1999 instead of 1957.So for those who shy away from old movies, don't avoid this one, because it is easily one of the best films ever made (hence its ranking in the Top 250 on this site).  Yeah, so it's in black and white- so was Schindler's List, and parts of the Blair Witch Project.  There are no phony special effects to make fun of, no stilted dialogue, and no bad acting.

476,Freddy_Levit,Should be in everyone's top ten list of greatest films of ALL TIME.....,10,11 January 2005,"........Films rarely get this uplifting and brilliant. I cannot think of the last time I was so intrigued by the flawless plot, dialogue and acting since 12 Angry Men. For such a simplistic story set in one jury room, it is surprising that Sidney Lumet can drain you of all your emotions and leave you on the edge of your seat with suspense, mystery, and some of the best acting your bound to ever see grace the silver screen!When a boy is on last day of trial for killing his father in the heat of domestic arguments, 12 jury men are forced to present a verdict in which if guilty, is the one way ticket to the electric chair for the boy. When the jury men decide to quickly end the discussion and raise their hands to find out who thinks the boy is guilty, only one jury man (Henry Fonda) doesn't put his hand up. Trial and Character revelations, doubts, and possibilities follow.So masterfully crafted is this film, that every time I watch it, only gets better. It includes some of the best character development I've ever seen. Sidney Lumet is an expert in this field and this is by far his greatest contribution to Hollywood history - one of the most important contributions to world cinema. However it was Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb who really made this film legendary, with their incredibly realistic performances. Casting was genius. And the dialogue was astoundingly riveting up until the brilliant finale. What really impressed me personally also was the camera angles and movements that made the film so suspenseful. Black and White made the film all the more powerful. And the music was minimal, which gave the film a more atmospheric experience, like you were their in the jury room with them - and you just feel that tension really built up as the movie proceeds.This inexpensive film, with such a simple setting had the world talking, the academy awards nominations rolling and Henry Fonda at his complete best form. I have rarely been so hypnotized by a film - 'Lawrence Of Arabia' and 'It's A Wonderful Life' are other ones that come to mind. This is a definitive viewing for anyone who loves film. It sums up everything I love about film. Everything from a technical point of view to superb acting and a simple yet complex character driven story, it's platinum and is most definitely one of the greatest cinematic achievements of all time - bar none! A statue should be erected in Sydney Lumet's honor......""Is it possible?"" - Juror #8/Henry Fonda",12 Angry Men
477,driver_8,Will Always Be a Classic,10,27 December 2004,"To me, this film is probably as close to perfect as any film ever was. The emotion, the story, the acting, etc. Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb squaring off. Different jurors harboring different beliefs, goals, views, etc. And even though this film was made close to fifty years ago, it is still as timely as ever. That is why I was so confused that somebody tried to shoot a re-make? Blasphemy! And by the way, that remake really sucked! Of course, after the first couple of times I saw this film, I was confused. I really though the kid did it. I still kind of think he did. Of course, that is the whole point of the film. Maybe he did do it, maybe not. The point of the story is about everybody getting a fair trial and a fair jury. Moreover, I will always remember the courage of Fonda's character, standing up to those eleven others, will very little to cling to. And how the jury ended up having to do what should have been done in the court room all along, try the case. Perhaps the main point of the film was to indict a society and criminal justice system that had lost it's way, if it ever had a way. But the lasting legacy of the film, is the fact that it just might be the greatest movie ever made.",12 Angry Men

While some may argue that this film is the best of all time, few will debate it's place in anyone's top ten list as it's masterful dialogue, riveting plot and virtually flawless direction will leave any filmmaker straining to beat. It's simplistic setting and costume design renders the film timeless and besides it's black and white visual it will certainly be able to captivate any audience that won't settle for anything less than a modern standard.

479,tobybunning,The Jury Votes 10 Stars,10,2 February 2021,"For someone who has loved films and always thought old black and white films were all to be ignored because they were too ancient in terms of technology and concept, so I was missing out on the classic highly rated films like Psycho, Schindlers List and Seven Samurai. I now feel so naive because now it makes me realise that you can make an incredible film with a what is now considered small budget just by being in one room the whole time and by having great characters all portrayed by first rate actors and note by knowing the characters names only by a number.Personal OpinionPlot
To be honest after reading the whole concept of the film about 12 men deciding if a prisoner is guilty or not I didn't think too much of it. To be honest I thought this film was just going to be boring so I just wanted to get it out the way and just say to people ""yeah I have seen it in case it came up in conversation"". But once you settle into the first start thinking about the whole film and see the tension between certain characters it really makes you realise how good the film really is.Script
In certain parts of the film when you think about the case they are discussing yes they say the same thing over and over again, but at the same time when certain questions come up you do think ""that is actually a good query"", they might not be obvious but they move the story along and when you keep that in mind you do realise it does shift own opinion on what you might have thought at the very start.CharactersYes, you don't actually know any characters names until the very end you only get numbers but some of them stand out far more than others. For example Juror 3 stands out because he is absolutely adamant the boy is guilty because he himself has family issues with his son, and he brings that personal pain into his judgment on the case beautifully. Another example is Juror 8 who pretty much the whole film is based around, also stands out as his lines and the way he delivers them makes it quite easy to see that are very clear that he is actually in two minds about the decision he has to make in terms of the final vote .Final DecisionFor someone who takes pride in watching their films I am so ashamed that I have not watched this film sooner especially as this is considered Number 4 on IMDB.

480,garabedbaghsarian,A true masterpiece for Critical Thinkers,10,3 November 2019,"For a low budget movie that takes place in one room and has 12 men in it, you'd expect to watch a dull and meaningless movie. But not this one. Within 1.5 hours, you learn a lot about how to not judge things fast. Instead, analyse and study the given fact, if they go according to science and logic or not.
The movie talks about 12 jurors who have to decide whether the suspected boy - who is accused of murdering his father, is not guilty or guilty and will be sentenced death. When it comes to voting, every member voted guilty quickly except juror #8, and this made the rest angry for such a ridiculous and waste of time act, especially that they heard ""the facts"". They were crystal clear that the boy was guilty. However, juror #8 refused the fact that they are rushing in taking action with such responsibility of sending an 18 years old boy to his death without fact-checking. As the movie goes by, juror #8 was able to convince the juror one by one when studying each given ""facts"" and proves them wrong logically and scientifically. Four other jurors took things personally, juror #3 was firm with the fact that the boy was Guilty (as it turned out that he was somehow taking revenge from his son who fought with him and then left the house). While juror #4 was not convinced till the end when juror #9 asked him personal question and example of the glasses, he got convinced because he personally knew the feeling of glass pain and marks that leaves on someone. Juror #7 was rushing just so he can have time to attend the Yankees baseball match as he hinted that the time was being wasted in discussion and changed his vote from Guilty to Not Guilty just because the majority flipped to Not Guilty and finally juror #5 felt relatable with the boy since he lived a similar childhood, being in slums and poor. He used his childhood knowledge of knives to prove that the knife fact was wrong and agreed that kid is Not Guilty.",12 Angry Men

Unlike other legal dramas, the entire film takes place in the juror room.  The beginning of the movie starts out with the jurors leaving to deliberate, and a single shot of the man whose fate they have to decide on.  I normally would have been bored with a film that takes place in a single setting, but the director does an incredible job of presenting the different characters, and brings a lot of personality to every one.  The viewer begins to understand each of the jurors as the movie progresses, and their reasonings for their verdict.The other great thing about this filmn, is that none of the facts of the case are presented in the court, and all of the knowledge the viewer has about the case come from the jurors. As they present their arguments, we begin to learn more about what might or might not have happened.  At the end of the film, we still don't know what actually happened, which shows that the movie isn't about whether or not the man is guilty or not, but the reasoning and logic that produces the final verdict given by the jurors. The tension in the jury room is amazing and you find yourself siding with certain jurors, almost as if you were actually in the room.",12 Angry Men
483,armaansm,OUTSTANDING COURTROOM DRAMA,10,6 July 2020,"A sensational murder occurred at around 11pm in NewYork City. Based on eyewitnesses, police arrested the victim's 18-year-old son as a suspect killer. When this case appeared at the courtroom, the judge ordered the jury board, consisting of 12 unanimous members, to place their verdicts of the fate of the accused youth. The jurists have to vote on either """"guilty"" or ""not guilty"". After the session ended, those jurists gather in a closed-door meeting.All jurists arrive from different backgrounds, professions and areas. They don't know each other. Jury Foreman, who is jury 1 (Martin Balsam), starts the meeting and requests all jurists to put their verdicts by raising hands. At first, except Jury 8 (Henry Fonda), all agree that the boy was guilty and he stabbed his father to death. Everybody asks why he does not agree with them. Jury 8 says that there should be some discussion needed before putting their decisions. Jury 8 also said that he doesn't want to say that the youth is fully innocent but he has a doubt about proving his guilty and he doesn't want to make an innocent punished due to the lack of strong evidence. One by one, he questions the overall investigational activities of this murder. He points the reliability of the murder weapon, witnesses and the circumstances. Jury 3 (Lee J. Cobb), who has been estranged from his own son, is vehemently against Jury 8 because he thinks that a son could murder his father as the accused youth has a violent past and Jury 10 (Ed Begley) who uses too many vulgar words to others especially Jury 8. Other jurists were also critical against Jury 8. Despite the criticism and offend, Jury 8 remains too calm and analytical throughout the jury meeting and explains his viewpoints. One by one, jurists feel that there are still lots of hidden facts that are not properly dig out before.The acting of all jurists were remarkable, especially by Henry Fonda as Jury 8. The way he explained his viewpoints to his counterparts was enjoyable to observe. It teaches us how to stay calm and quiet in turbulent situations where everybody is against you.This film was nominated for Academy Awards in the categories of Best Director, Best Picture, and Best Writing of Adapted Screenplay, however, it couldn't won none of them. As per Rotten Tomatoes, it is the highest rating earned courtroom drama of all time.",12 Angry Men
484,pauld2b,NO EXPLOSIONS,10,22 April 2004,"I have always loved this movie. I read a review from another subscriber that dissed the newer movies like the LOTR Trilogy. He recommended that many new movie fans watch the old movies. Some young people I know will not watch some movies because they are in black and white. A person that I love has said that it is difficult to watch older movies because you have to pay so much attention to the dialogue. This is really sad because this person is extremely intelligent and reads the classics all the time. I loved when my 22 YO daughter watched Psycho(1960) for the first time a few years ago and was completely fooled having never heard about it. So my friends maybe there is hope. Maybe as time goes on the lure of crashing cars and explosions will be less attractive. The accomplishments of special effects will always be just another facet in the diadem of great movie making.Nobody has ever done Frankenstein better than Karloff. King Kong is creeping up on 75 years and the special effects are still ""special"". In the Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) they accomplished the ""effect"" of arrows striking the villains by having the master archer of the daytwang real arrows into stunt men wearing breastplates and the score was written to be in musical tune with the dialogue. AND! it was in color!All the way back in 1938!!! I have luckily played Juror # 3 in several stage productions and know every word of dialogue in all of the versions(stage, tele-play and screenplay) and in my opinion this is a masterpiece. This movie is simply brilliant from every aspect of film as an art. There are no explosions,curse words, car chases or machine guns. But there is unbelievable tension and real violence. Plenty of naked hatred and prejudice. For those of you who have not seen this and are wise enough and maybe old enough to appreciate it please watch and enjoy. For those of you who need hate and violence to get cranked up this movie has all of that without all the phony pretense.

490,sherbetsaucers,1000 Words Is Not Enough,10,6 February 2007,"This movie has been more influential than any other in the way I see the world. Any person who watches it and is later called to jury service cannot help but have visions of themselves fighting for justice. A true ensemble piece, each actor has a chance to truly shine in what must be considered one of the finest courtroom dramas ever made. It is certainly the finest courtroom drama ever made where we only see the courtroom for a minute and a half.Each of the jury members is almost a stereotype. Each of them is an aspect of ourselves: Juror number one. He seems to let his duties preoccupy him somewhat, and in fact puts more interest into them than in the actual reason he is there, blinded by the system.Juror number two is mild mannered and good natured. However he is unlikely to ever make a stand himself. He is the everyman.Juror number three is an emotionally damaged father. He has become a revenger, seeking to punish the defendant because of the anger he has towards his son.Juror number four is rational and logical. However his devotion to logic is pointless, as he has not been passionate enough to discover all of the facts. Rather than questioning, he accepts.Juror number five comes from a violent background. A young man, he reminds us that just because a person lives in a certain neighbourhood that is no excuse for breaking the law or violent behaviour.Juror number six is a working man. He is strong, but respectful and also highly principled. This character is the 'Working Joe', the people who just get on with their jobs and do them.Juror number seven is ambivalence personified. One might almost call him the id. Continually throughout the movie he makes jokes, at the beginning his wise-cracking nature is amusing but it soon begins to grate. He is more interested in satisfying his own petty desires than doing a good job.Juror number eight is decency. The lone dissenter. The only person who initially questions all that they have been told. Throughout the movie he pushes his fellow jurors to see past what has been so easily presented and to search for the deeper possible truth.Juror number nine can be summoned up in one word: Understanding. While number eight may be the first person who questions, without number nines support he would have failed. It is nine that, more than anybody else, truly empathises with the witnesses. It is his initial insight into the human condition that sways a number of jurors, including juror number four.Juror number ten is blinded by his bigotry. Unlike any other jury member he seems to have no real endearing qualities, having an annoying way of speaking, a rude manner, even an intrusive cough.Juror number eleven is an immigrant. He has come to America because of all that it represents. Because of this it is ironic that he is the one who seems to remind others of what it means to be part of a democracy.Juror number twelve represents hesitant behaviour. He is the only jury member to change his mind more than once.Within these twelve characters there is a lot of symbolism involved. Juror number eight falters only once. When talking with six he is forced to question the full implications of allowing a guilty man to go free. Despite all of the passion and and reasoned arguments given by other jurors, it is this simple man who is the only person who makes number eight question himself. Juror number twelve, the unsure character, actually works in advertising. Though he can tell others what to want he is unsure himself. Juror number nine, who supports number eight more than any other, is also seated next to him. The most symbolic figure is, of course, number eight.Unlike any other jury member he does not offer a single piece of personal information about himself throughout the entire movie. Anything we do learn about his personal life or background we learn because other jury members have asked him. He is concerned only with finding out what is relevant to the case. He is an architect. He is a man who helps others realise their dreams, helps other build something great. Of course he is also dressed in white, like a lone paladin, a night in shining armour slaying the evil dragon. Fonda played Wyatt Earp in My Darling Clementine, a role he was deservedly famous for. Who better than a mythological law man to fight for justice now? We know right is on his side.However it is not just the acting that shines. The direction is superb. Initially Lumet cleverly places the camera above eye level, using a wide angled lense. Throughout the movie this gradually changes until we are finally seeing the action from low down with the focal length of the lens having been increased. This leads to a greater feeling of claustrophobia, with tight zoom-ins causing sweaty, angry faces to fill the screen. The most notable exception to this is the scene where all of the jury distance themselves from the racist views of number ten. Here we see him isolated and alone, and indeed it is the one time we see the entire room on the screen, further enhancing the feeling of his loneliness.In the end only juror number three is left voting guilty. He is put in the same situation as number eight was earlier. However, unlike number eight he does not have the conviction of his beliefs and so quickly crumbles, unable to stand against the other eleven.12 Angry Men remains an important, much beloved movie. It shows us many facets of humanity, the highs and lows, and also what one man can do if he truly believes he is right.",12 Angry Men

Great acting all around and superb direction from Sidney Lumet, who never made a better film in his career. This movie is basically one long scene, and it never gets boring. Some of the arguments about the trial are really stretching, but in the end, the trial is not even what the film is all about. Fonda is great, as always, but the glory here goes to Lee J. Cobb.

I feel obliged to praise it without conservation.This is a typical example of minority influence: a single person sticking to his point gradually change everyone's opinion. The process is more than intriguing. I initially feel like the guys that vote for guilty are the kind of guys that vote for Donald Trump: ignorant, single-minded, stubborn, indifferent, selfish, occupied by stereotypes and prejudices, and always ready to comply. But as the film proceed, I gradually feel the warmth and intelligence that they possess, and to watch this amazing glare of humanity gradually brought out by the architect is most pleasant. It is a grandiose fight between calmness and arbitrariness, indifference and mercy, critical thinking and groupthink, equality and prejudice, ""supposition"" and ""facts"". The most startling technique this film uses is the transformation from above eyesight wide-angle shots to at eyesight level close-up shots. This change of distance between the camera to the audience makes the tempo tenser, and attracts significantly more attention to their points. Like many, I was not into the film in the first five minutes, but the longer I watched, the more my emotions were swayed by different points of view. Yet I wasn't even aware of it before I read it here. It is a very startling invention indeed.My favorite shot in the movie is when the man talked about how ""they"" are born to be villains, or how ""they"" naturally have the violent tendencies, all the juries walked from their seats one by one to show quiet disagreement. The impact was like shoving a bottle of icy soda into my chest, I was so touched that I started clapping my hands. Although racism might be a reason why all of them vote for guilty in the first place, the knowledge eventually dawned on them that this is wrong. My psychology teacher taught us that prejudices often occurs unconsciously. As soon as it is dragged from the shadow of unconsciousness to the level of reasonable judgment, its flaws immediately reveal themselves. The man remained silent for the rest of the film.Although I wonder whether they caught the true murderer or not, it is fairly clear that the boy wasn't necessarily the murderer. He could be, but he didn't deserve to be sent to death sentence immediately. My friend said that she suspected the murderer to be the architect, I'd say is fairly reasonable, or why would he bought an identical knife in the neighborhood? But anyway, the architect successfully avoided murdering an innocent boy with silence, I will give him a round applause for that.",12 Angry Men

THE FOLLOWING HALF OF MY TEXT MIGHT SPOIL THE FILM FOR YOUEven though the movie was a criminology drama, it didn't feature any twist at the ending that revolved the whole outcome of the judgment you've been building up during the whole first hour and a half. The convincing is totally linear, except for one jury member changing his mind (between the two votes 'guilty'/'not guilty') twice. I would have liked to see a script with a bit more thought behind it.

496,thepsychocritic,Delight in black and white.,10,31 August 2011,"Courtroom dramas don't work well with everyone. Neither do movies in black and white, people find them dull, boring and lack-lustre. 12 Angry Men falls in both these categories. Yet, it manages to astound you with its breathtaking brilliance and subtle perfection.A boy is convicted of murdering his father. Witnesses, good lawyers, bad past record, motive; an open and shut case. Three minutes into the movie and the twelve jury members are in their chamber. They have all got their priorities and schedules - one has a baseball match, another has his garages going to pot. Everyone wants to leave; it is not their butt that is going to land on the electric chair anyway. Prior to a discussion of any sort, an initial vote is held with the hopes of making a quick, clean job out of it. Eleven are convinced he is guilty. One isn't quite so sure. And hence unfolds one of the greatest dramas Hollywood has ever seen.The movie doesn't waste time in showing the lawyers fighting like shark. It doesn't show a depressed teenager sobbing his guts out in the box. The camera focuses on him but once, and that single look is enough to convey a farrago of emotions - fear, exhaustion, uncertainty and a certain innocence. Instead, it does what it is meant to - focus on the twelve men that matter; in whose hands resides the fate of the accused. They are regular people from everyday spheres of life - a coach, architect, bank clerk - men who don't overanalyze when presented with facts. They naively, yet innocuously, take things at their face value which compels them to reach the guilty verdict; after all, the evidence is overwhelming. The lone man (Henry Fonda) who contradicts them, however, realizes the onus that has befallen them and refuses to reach a hasty conclusion, for he believes that there is the possibility of there being reasonable doubt and as the American Constitution states, a man is innocent until proved guilty. Initially, the others are merely taken aback at the trivial inconvenience due to this rebellion of sorts. But this soon turns to resentment, finally boiling to anger - something that beautifully justifies the title of the movie.Henry Fonda does a convincing job as juror number eight. He is brooding, intelligent, pragmatic and at the same time calm with a mild demeanour. His acting isn't artificial as he thoroughly indulges himself in his role. The performance is powerful and both the jury members and viewers find it hard to counter his arguments. He asserts that ratiocination is the best and only way to decide - for a man's life hangs in the balance. As the movie proceeds, you see him demolishing proofs one after the other, till they all collapse like a stack of cards. The others too play their part, however, there isn't a real standout among the remaining eleven; a shortcoming that the movie faces. The rest of the characters have been poorly portrayed and lack depth; there is nothing that stands out or is memorable about them. While the film had several chances to introduce more dimensions to its actors, it simply fails to do so, despite the fact that is it primarily a character-centric movie. Fonda is staunch in the lead role, but the faceless others serve no purpose than contradict him, sticking to him like leeches, without creating an identity of their own.The tension has been skilfully built up - right from the weather (it is the hottest day of the year) to the claustrophobic environment where the entire episode takes place. The idiosyncrasies of men have been highlighted wonderfully; their feeble mindedness, their anxiety, dogmatism, their indecisiveness and their fury at being constantly opposed by men who change their votes like the flip of a coin. They reason out, fight, talk dirty and negotiate. Their faces glisten with sweat. They smoke. A weapon is brandished and a man resorts to violence. Men are prejudiced, for the accused comes from a poor society with a history of violence. Some even cite personal reasons for convicting the boy. There is racism, bigotry and impatience; but juror number eight refuses to budge, for he believes that the life of a man is worth more than that. The director Sidney Lumet (Network, Dog Day Afternoon) knows that the movie isn't about the suspense and doesn't try to make it into one. It is about how the characters have been drawn out, each representing a dimension of human personality. Though, like many great movies, 12 Angry Men was a commercial failure, it is considered as a benchmark in American cinema. It is touching, mesmerising and provocative, and it does so much in a mere ninety six minutes, which indisputably makes it one of the greatest cult classics of all times.",12 Angry Men
497,gingerrdriley,Listening to those tummies growl makes me think they ought to be called 12 Hungry Men.,9,2 March 2017,"This is a pretty good example of why execution will always matter more than any kind of extravagant production or over inflated budget. Anyone even remotely familiar with this film understands that it's just 12 guys in a room arguing over a trial. It's a concept so simple on a visual level that it could just as easily be a middle school stage production and you could probably still find much of the iconography which comprises the setting. Again though, none of that takes away from this film. To begin with, this film couldn't have been shot better. Sidney Lumet's background in television allows him to take full advantage of shifting lenses and ensemble shots which give the film an escalating sense of tension that in indispensable in convincing the audience that the dialogue happening between these men is A) taking them a long time and B) is physically, mentally and emotionally taxing for them. It's pretty easy to imagine a more amateur director shooting this film in a more flat and repetitive way. Thankfully Lumet isn't an amateur. Every shot and cut is so purposeful in this film. Not a frame is wasted and the one room setting at no point becomes tiresome.This film really reaches it's greatest heights with it's characters, despite how wonderful the visual narrative is. All 12 men are unique characters. None of them fades in to the background and they all bring a unique perspective to the case in question. You get a really good sense of the lives they lead outside the confines of this room they're in. At a certain point you get to have such a good understanding of the different men that whenever a knew point of debate is brought up you can start to piece together how each one of them is going to process it and how it might affect their ultimate decision on the case. It's really a bit of a difficult balancing act. In the end there are certain members of the jury which naturally have to take a more dominant role in the story than the others, but at the same time you have to allot the others time to bring depth to their character. Lumet and the actors put it all together flawlessly. One you thing you might notice when watching this film is the general lack of music. I think ultimately it's better that way. In all likelihood music would have been more of a distraction than a tool in enhancing the tone of a given scene. There is music of course, but the reservation with which it is used ends up giving it more relevance to the story than if it book-ended every scene in the film. This film is in the dialogue and character interaction, and really there isn't enough room for any kind of over the top score, but again, that doesn't detract from the experience in any way.Check it out if you haven't. It's great. 9/10.",12 Angry Men
498,mrmac-42561,Memorable and Engrossing,10,23 February 2019,"Much has been said over the years about this brilliant movie. It still entertains no matter how often it is viewed. The 12 jurors are a complete cross-section of society ranging from the liberal to the racist. Interestingly there are no women on the jury or in the movie as a whole but this does not detract from the quality of the acting.
The main flaw comes near the end regarding the eyesight of the main witness in another building who saw the murder through the windows of a passing L train. We are told that this woman was in her mid forties but dressed in court to look ten years younger. Now, even the most stupid lawyer would bring up the question of whether the witness needed to use glasses and especially if she had them on when the killing took place. Why did the accused boy's lawyer not bring up this point?
Still, this movie should be on everyone's list of the top 20 films ever made.",12 Angry Men

505,conono,Convenient or otherwise...,7,4 May 2012,"This stagebound potboiler has a plot which is a matter of shooting fish in a barrel. Racism, to use the prime example, is used as an instance of a rush to judgment and then it's used to excuse a rush to the opposite judgment.Still it's important to realize that this is entertainment. The equivalent of advocacy journalism, I admit, but no one denies that the creators of this entertainment have agendas. To the extent that the film affected me, it emphasized again in my mind how fallible our system of justice is. One should steer clear of it at all costs (The justice system, not the film).And having said that, we've arrived at our system of justice through centuries of trial and error. And the advocacy system still seems superior to any previous arrangement.But back to the film: it's respected because it's tightly plotted and exhibits impressive characterizations on the parts of several actors. I'm sorry that several characters are stereotypes when stereotyping itself is the 'crime' the jury (as opposed to the accused) is so guilty of. But the fact is that stereotyping is how messages are conveyed through the mass media, and it's a matter of whose stereotypes are being retailed. Rose & Lumet have their own, and they indeed add up to shooting fish in a barrel. (Immigrants=good, Nativist Americans=bad, etc.)There's also an implication that with enough consideration, no one would ever be considered guilty of anything, especially if we consider extenuating circumstances. Separately, it's scary to consider that the lack of air conditioning in jury rooms led to a lot of hasty verdicts!Finally, though, I can readily imagine how bracing this entertainment was in 1957. It was probably very much like a lightning bolt.",12 Angry Men

The entire movie is basically twelve sweating men arguing in one room for an hour and a half. However, the dynamics of the script and the performances of the actors in this claustrophobic presentation are the key elements that make this film a classic. Not a shot in this film is wasted. Every moment is filled with tension brought about by actors who knew how to utilize every aspect of their bodies to portray emotion from their position to their expression. Each character is so unique, you'd think it was a complete slice of Americana minus African American representation. ""12 Angry Men"" is a must see movie not simply because it is an acting tour de force, but because as a film it works and as a piece of cinema history, it is a classic that must be seen, this version being the best.",12 Angry Men

Having been a grand juror, I can state that reasonable doubt means that the evidence cannot point to guilt and only guilt. Gut feelings and emotion have no place in this. I give it an eight because it is still great drama.POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEADFonda's character says that they must be sure. He presents gut feelings and supposition. Eyewitness testimony is dismissed because witnesses may be lying even though no evidence is presented to support them lying. Fonda's character accepts anything that suggests without evidence that facts are not as they seem. If one dismisses facts without evidence just because people may be mistaken - with no evidence that they are - no one can find anyone guilty and we have no jury system. As for the movie, it has every cliché in the book. Supposition are created almost out of thin air, to support doubt. No evidence is presented for this. If one forgets the clichés and is ignorant of our jury system, the movie can be riveting, and make perfect sense. If you examine the movie, it makes a case for never finding anyone guilty.

It is ture that its plot is nothing special and it seems very boring at first but as you get deeper and deeper you start to enjoy it. Because the thing that makes this movie good is not some awesome and unique plot but the impressive dialogues. I actually think that this movie is a bit overrated but I have to admit that it has one of the best dialogues. These marvelous dialogues are the thing that makes this movie the masterpiece it is.The acting is on an average level. The actors did a good job but I can't say that anyone of them did an outstanding performance. As for the cinematography it could've been better.

516,kylebengel,Methaphors in Film...,10,17 May 2005,"To begin with, let me state for the record that I think this is the finest film of the 1950's and one of the best films of all times. Only the fact that so many other people share my opinion has prevented me from writing a glowing review on this site, as there were already so many to choose from.However, I saw the film again last night on Turner Classic Movies (and stayed up until well after midnight to watch it, trading sleep for artistic sustenance) and I was struck be something that seemed so obvious, yet had always eluded me in past viewings. I was struck by the use of metaphor in the film. I guess that I had never seen it quite that way before as I was content to watch a simple, yet exciting play unfold. But last night was a revelation. The three metaphors that most jumped out at me are as follows: 1) The lighting. In order to simulate the growing darkness of the storm out the window, the lighting was slowly turned down through the film until it became obvious that the lights in the room would have to be turned on. When Juror-1 turns the lights on, the whole room changes. As the darkness had crept in, the room had become more and more hostile. Yet, when the light came on, most of the characters' attitudes change to more genial manor. The lights comes on after Juror-8 has made most of his points and it seems the light is the symbolic turning of the Jury.2) The cinematography. The direct deliberately changed his lenses in the camera through the shoot to make the walls of the Jury Room seem to close in on the Jurors. This is a nice physiological trick, but it seemed to me to be more. Notice how, the closer they get to a hung jury, the closer they come to Juror's #-3, -4, and -10 simply declaring themselves hung, the closer the walls get. But in the final scene in the room, when they are all leaving, the camera lens reverts back to the proportions used at the beginning of the film. The room is big and airy again. I like the symbolism of of the room, representing the weight of the defendant's life, closing in on them.3) (My favorite) The Rain. Prior to the storm starting, all of the Jurors have voted the way they do at the end except for #'s 3,4 & 10, all of whom are carrying ""baggage"" of their own. #-4 is a man possessed of intellect and sees himself as above the other's mentally. #-10 has years of racism blinding him. And #-3 has the memory of his failed relationship with his son. Then it begins raining, hard. Juror-10 has his great scene and simply self-destructs, in the process letting go of his racism, at least for the moment. Juror-4 undergoes the ""eyeglasses"" scene and lets go of his self-assumed intellectual superiority. And Juror-3 (Lee J. Cobb is the MAN!) launches into that most famous scene, finally letting go of his anger toward his own son. As soon as they release their own personal demons, the truth become evident to them, the rain, as it were, having washed their souls clean. No sooner is it has #-3 completed his transformation then it stops raining...and the sun begin to peak through the darkness. This is GENIUS film making! In the end, maybe that is way I love this film so much: each time I watch it, there is something new to find. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",12 Angry Men

Both are, in my opinion, great showcases of character acting.One other thing I particularly like about this 1957 film is the cinematography - it's very well shot and you can get a real sense of feeling enclosed in that jury room.

Fortunately not all people are the same.Out of 12 people we may find one man who's able to turn the rest around, back on the tracks of justice and moral duty.To put it simple, what do we obtain if we put 12 different men, and when i mean different, i mean different like fire/water, in the same room? We get an outstanding sample of how things really occur in the jurors chamber.It's not pleasant, not nice. Every character has it's own faulty impressions, it's own flaws, defects and those things have a direct importance in making a vital decision, a life and death one.Whether it's right or wrong, who cares?,justice won't prevail, never did, never will, there's no objectivity, everything comes to those 12 angry men.Well, seems like juror no8 has something to say about the failure of the USA justice system.It's a proof of character and civic duty to stand in front of 11 men pleading guilty, and say not guilty, ""like a pain in the ass"", like an obstacle in front of ""more important things to do"", like there is something more important than the life of a young man. Maybe i'm naive, but i'd like to think we live in a fair world, even if the reality shows us something else, I admire and salute the presence of juror no8 in this classic, beautiful interpreted by Henry Fonda. Funny, how one man can make a difference, this is in fact the whole message, that a single man can turn things around, if he keeps his temper and shows character.We live in an unfair world, that's the inconvenient truth, the question is: what are those involved in the system, especially the jurors, going to do? Watch carefully and find out.The budget is ridiculous, but what do you need money for, when you have Sydney Lumet? Big budgets don't guarantee success, 12 angry men is the proof. This one is more than just a movie, it's the truth we all know and do not say.

If you're one that appreciates some mystery, drama, a rollercoaster of a ride, you'll enjoy this movie. Granted it's not for all, its lack of action, romance or Michael Bay explosions may have some falling asleep, but to those who appreciate a good thriller, it'll have you on the edge of your seat the whole time.It's easy to become desensitized today about what truly makes a good movie, with CGI a norm, relying solely on A list actors and actresses instead of a good screenplay prolific, we forget just how powerful well-written dialogue is. It's that dialogue that transports you into this movie, that thrusts you into the whirlwind of plot and emotion and doesn't let go until the movie's over. You walk away from this film in awe, not thinking well if 100 million dollars falls in my lap I could make a movie like that.

524,mkfreeberg,Benefit of Hindsight,8,7 August 2005,"(Spoilers) I really liked the message of the movie: A lot of times things that look crystal clear at first glance, upon deeper inspection, aren't so clear. The acting was top-notch all-around, especially with Juror #9. The product ends up being not very preachy, which is a considerable achievement given that it's built entirely around a simple parable.With the benefit of hindsight, though, one can see a few things about this that I personally find really disturbing.The question that drives the movie is whether the jurors have properly awarded the defendant the benefit of any reasonable doubt, and as the climax approaches, the attention given to this reaches a fevered pitch. Left behind in the dust, is the equally critical question of whether the defendant is really guilty. There's a scene early on when Jack Warden, the juror who just wants to get the voting over with so he can watch a ball game, meets Henry Fonda in the washroom. The last two lines in that scene discuss the possibility that the boy may be acquitted, even though he is guilty. Fonda says something to the effect of ""that very well may be"" or some such, and to my recollection this is the last time this possibility is even considered.The jury may have released a murderer onto the streets. You can make the argument that with the presence of reasonable doubt, this was their job. I agree. But as Henry Fonda walks down the courthouse steps to resume his everyday life as an architect, would it really then be fitting to have the happy ""a wrong has been righted"" swelling-orchestra music, as our hero walks proudly among his fellow citizens with his head held high? Doubt or no, conviction or no, this kind of peace-of-mind is not lying in wait for you after your last day on a real jury. There are jurors who want it anyway, and because of that, will not convict anyone. They have seen this movie, and want to be Henry Fonda. I've served with them. It's a pretty serious problem.There is a short speech given by Fonda shortly after he is revealed to be the one juror who wants to acquit. Several times in the speech he makes the point that the defendant is poor, has had a rough background, and has been beaten up a lot. It is not entirely clear where he is going with this, since the movie is supposed to be about what is reasonable doubt, and how the doubt applies regardless of economic class. There is at least one other juror who wants to convict because the defendant is poor; does Fonda mean to say with a defendant who was wealthier, he himself would have voted to convict? That doesn't seem likely at all. But then why bring it up? It means something to other jurors, but it isn't supposed to mean anything to Fonda. The only way it could support any of Fonda's arguments, is if he was making decisions based on the way those decisions made him feel about himself, rather than based on the evidence. This is something jurors aren't supposed to do.Four years after this movie was made, the Supreme Court defined the Exclusionary Rule in Mapp v. Ohio. So by this time, you weren't supposed to convict anyone unless you knew they were guilty beyond any reasonable doubt, and in addition to that, if you knew too much, then you still couldn't convict. During the sixties, conviction became such an unlikely goal even when the evidence seemed compelling, that a lot of District Attorneys refused to make arrests even though they knew a suspect posed a significant danger to society.By the seventies, Americans were so fed-up with the ""justice system failing us"" that they began turning politicians out of office in bulk, hoping against hope they could fix what was broken before their own children were murdered or their wives were raped. Between Vietnam and Watergate, this was a third salvo against our fragile faith in government, and it was an erosion of our trust that we don't talk about too much today.What really concerns me is that a little while after this film was made, with the poorest Americans being forced to live among violent people and thus becoming increasingly interested in vigilantism, suddenly we had a huge surge in movies about ""Taking the law into your own hands."" Dirty Harry, Death Wish, and countless made-for-TV projects. In summary, the pendulum swung in one direction, then a few years later, the other. Hollywood got to make money both times.I have trouble getting completely behind this film because it's a concentrated effort, ultimately a successful one, to get that pendulum swinging wildly. If we spent that relatively short amount of time, just fifteen years or so, leaving ""revolution"" out of it and reforming our justice system in baby steps, the mistakes of the past could have been avoided. I do not know if it was possible to fix what was broken back then, by doing this -- convictions weren't always carefully considered back in the 1950's & earlier. But a lot of innocent people would be alive today if all those violent felons, in subsequent years, were arrested like they should have been.I would say, if you're going to serve on a jury, by all means rent this because it's a very meticulous and passionate reminder of your civil duty, it makes some great points, and everything in this movie is highest-quality. But also on your required-viewing list would be Primal Fear, the Richard Gere movie. Better yet, watch that one last, so the final scene really sticks in your mind.Nobody should be serving on a jury, if they can't seriously consider the consequences of releasing people who are really guilty of violent crimes.",12 Angry Men
525,zsigomiklos,I am one of the 12 angry men - UNMISSABLE CLASSIC,10,13 July 2007,"Henry Fonda is my personal favourite of the classic cinema era in the 1940's (The Lady Eve, The Grapes of Wrath etc.). Sidney Lumet grabbed the point of film-making in this movie, made a genuine, unprecedented and essential classic masterpiece. What is virtuosity, if not shooting a meaningful discussion in the 90% of a movie in a room?! There is no strong acting or outstanding camera work, but everyone shares equally in setting up this incomparable courtroom drama. What an editing, what a great simple base story! The release year of the film is 1957 and I think it is a perfect timing because from my viewpoint it refers to communism, and people's disbelief in it. I mean by that that not everything is what is looks like, and it is easy to agree with the majority on obvious evidences.

This movie hits hard on many levels, the directing is masterful, making each viewer feel personally invested into the murder, the ethical choice of choosing on the fate of someones life and hoping that the people you are watching will do the right choice and deciding if they actually do the right choice or if they have all been duped by doubt. This movie is minimalist staying principally in one room, with 12 characters deciding the fate of a human being. The film traverses many genres: from the courtroom drama, to the detective drama, to the ethical character(s)portrait rendered by conversation and relation that each character has with one another and excels at each giving the audience a refined viewing experience, with little to no flaw.",12 Angry Men

This film is a major triumph that still creates a stir in me every time I see it.  It's power is not in the visual images created, (although much of the cinematography is imaginative, especially the last shot from the coat closet, even with the challenge of one major room), but in the drama created by the tension of men coming together from all walks of lives to judge another human being.  They bring their prejudices, their fear, their life experiences, their lack of interest, and their anonymity into a room to make a decision--that's when the real story starts.We all think about the possibility of having to face that day--some relish the opportunity while others fear making a bad decision.  It's one reason this film resonates with so many people.  It's a common experience that brings out different emotions in different people.  The remake, although not as effective because of the lack of originality, is also good and brings in other points of view, including racial issues.  Both lack one thing--a female's point of view!  But that creates even more tension.  After all, men don't want to deal with their emotions the same way women do.  Besides, we would have to change the title!  :o)",12 Angry Men

It's a great honor to see someone take a screenshot and quote this short comment 11 years ago as a vulgar mass representative. Now I would like to add that it is one thing to say that the dereliction of duty by the organs of power. There is no fault in reasonable questioning, but there is a fault in the verdict of acquittal.

535,dominicpearson,A Flawed Classic,7,27 December 2009,"I watched this film for the first time about a year ago and rated it 8/10 then. Having re-watched it today I have felt the need to knock another point off.I really enjoyed this film. I love the premise of having an entire film shot predominantly in a single location in real time. In a lot of ways it is more of a play than a film and this gives it a unique twist (although I am aware of plenty of other films that adopt the same technique).The positives points of the film are: Character development - We get to know the characters at the same time and to the same depth as those in the room, no more, no less. We are given limited knowledge about them, their backgrounds, their prejudices and are encouraged to judge them in similar vain to how they are judging the defendant on the limited information they have about him. Very clever and the mix of personalities from the shy, retiring to the clearly angry and racist rings true of the likely cross section of personalities that would be found in a real jury room.The message of the story - I think it rings true today just as much as it did in the 1950's. Trial by jury is a flawed concept and people can be easily manipulated by fellow jurors and lawyers alike. I particularly like how juror 12 flits between guilty and not guilty and how they are all too eager to make a snap judgement without thinking in the first instance. This is a common problem - these people are not lawyers, they do not think like lawyers and will always struggle to set aside their personal feelings and prejudices to look at the facts in the cold, hard light of day taking account of the reasonable doubt issue. The manner in which this film uses its limited set/time frame to achieve the very real feeling of manipulation is impressive to say the least.The acting - All of the actors play their parts perfectly. You find yourself wanting to know more about them but realise the premise is that you are in the same shoes as the others. To be given such thinly created (in the best sense possible) characters and still want to know more about them (where did the racist undertones come from, what happened between juror 3 and his son, why is juror 8 so eager to prove the reasonable doubt?) is impressive, especially in such an ensemble piece.So where does it lose points? Simply put I don't like the way that the ""innocence"" is proved. It flys in the face of the proper court process and is just a little unbelievable and all too conveniently pieced together (do you really think they would be paying such close attention to a witnesses nose??). I understand the need to create the reasonable doubt but feel that it was done too easily with each juror falling into place far too quickly. I was also disappointed that juror 3 gave up his convictions. It would have been a much greater triumph, in my eyes, if it had been a hung jury. I agreed with juror 3 and empathised with the choice he had to make and felt that the ""honorable"" juror 8 bullied his opinions on everyone else.The point of the jury is to consider the evidence put before them and to make a judgement on that basis. They should not bring in numerous assumptions (and that is what they did) which colour the evidence they have been given. Doing so will always create sufficient doubt to acquit the defendant. There is too much danger in doing so and I do not believe that in a room of 12 strong characters no one would raise such an objection.Or I may be missing the point entirely! Maybe the manipulation by juror 8 is the whole point....In conclusion, therefore, I can see why it is a classic but am at slight pains to understand its high position in the top 250 given the nature of the perceived flaws. Having said this I suggest that if you enjoy thought provoking, well scripted and acted drama this film is a must see.",12 Angry Men

Sidney Lument directs this film with great treatment. Hardly any musical score, and about 95% of the action taking place in one room is very hard to do, but he pulls it off. And I have to say, this is probably one of the greatest ensemble casts ever put on film. All 12 jurors are excellent. Henry Fonda delivers his performance in the every man feel he always performs. Lee J. Cobb delivers his best performance in his career. E.G. Marshall, Martin Balsam, Jack Warden, Ed Begley, and Robert Webber are just a few of the other names that lead the cast with their roles. Why were none of these actors up for any Oscars for this film? It's still a mystery to me.

539,pvilleguy,Riveting,9,26 April 2006,"This is a fine film with a terrific cast. Its Spartan set serves to draw the viewer into the intensity that churns throughout the deliberations of the twelve men constitute the jury in a criminal case. It is hard to imagine a simpler story line: the twelve person jury has retired to deliberate the fate of a young man charged with murdering his father. One of the number (Henry Fonda) votes ""not guilty"" in the first vote. The other 11 jurors, more or less convinced that they are discussing an ""open and shut"" case, immediately set out to prove him wrong. Instead, one expresses doubts about the evidence and proceeds to convince the other jurors, one by one, of the flaws in the evidence and the existence of a reasonable doubt as to the guilt. Nearly all of the action takes place in the jury room, or in the restroom adjacent to it. There is no recreation of the crime other than those portions of the evidence ""acted out"" by the jurors in the course of their deliberations. This film does not emphasize the police work, or the work of the lawyers in the trial, or of investigators, or forensic evidence. Instead, the viewer is drawn into the drama of twelve jurors trying to decide what is the right thing to do in the case. Each in turn reveals a bias or flaw in his logic that has caused him to view the evidence in a particular way. In the end, each is confronted to identify his blind spot and acknowledge that it is that blind spot that caused him to think the defendant guilty rather than a careful examination of the evidence. One just wants to get to the Yankees game, one believes if an immigrant is charged with a crime he has to be guilty, and so forth. There are two dramatic moments that stand out above the rest. The first is the speech by Ed Begley in which he reveals that his determination of guilt is based on nothing other than blind prejudice. During his speech, the jurors leave the table and turn their backs on Begley, who in the end acknowledges his bias. The second is when the final holdout juror, Lee J. Cobb, comes to grips with the fact that he hopes to punish the defendant as a means of vicariously punishing his own son, who has apparently rejected Cobb. Of course each of those instances are high melodrama -- would that racial or ethnic prejudice was as easily identified and eliminated as it was in the film -- but each is played out with sufficient intensity as not to seem hokey or contrived. The film does show its age in a couple of respects -- there are no women on this jury, and no people of color -- an all white male jury in late 1950's New York is pretty unlikely. Nonetheless, this is a superb film with tremendous performances by the ensemble cast. On another level, ""Twelve Angry Men"" betrays a kind of pre-Vietnam, pre-JFK assassination innocence about the ability of American ideals to triumph over all sorts of biases if only people are made to confront those biases. That idea is of course harder to sustain post-Vietnam, post-JFK murder, post-Watergate, but it is worthy of noting that not too long ago, it was still believed that such a triumph of ideals was possible. In the polarized nation we live in now, where the more obvious people's biases become, the more tenaciously they cling to them, the underlying message of ""Twelve Angry Men"" just might be one we need to hear.",12 Angry Men

550,CouchReview,12 Angry Men(1957)- Review,9,15 January 2021,"12 Angry Men is a courtroom drama displaying deliberations, as its name suggests, by 12 men who are part of a jury and have to make a consensual decision about an 18 year old boy who has allegedly stabbed his father to death and faces a death penalty. The boy does not come from a glorious background and with his violent past everyone quickly forms a judgment of him. Initially seeming an open & shut case with all evidence pointing fingers to the boy, all jurors unhesitatingly vote guilty in a preliminary vote apart from one, Juror 8 (Henry Fonda). While he too doesn't have very high regards for the boy, but believes the evidence collected can be questioned when thoroughly studied. With this he feels there is a reasonable doubt to the boy's involvement to the horrendous act. Other jurors already having made a conclusion in their mind initially get agitated by Juror 8 who is taking an opposite position to the general public & all the jurors. Without all jurors agreeing a verdict cannot be declared so they need to continue their deliberation, this fact adds to all the other jurors' frustration. The movie till the end displays the whole deliberation among the 12 men and Juror 8 trying to make the others realise that there is a faintest doubt if not a strong one.
The movie may be made decades ago but still does not fail to capture the attention of any viewer be it of any generation. It is a brilliant production devising which would have required an exceptional mind. With only one location setting and majorly showing only the 12 men for almost the whole of the movie, might have initially caused ridicule in the ideation stage, but that concept of a single setting and just a little more than a handful of actors is what makes the film so amazing. The story/case is surely not the most expansive but with Fonda and the other actors gives a different depth which no one could have anticipated. The dialogues fairly well written keeping it precise and very much to the point.
Some viewers may be discouraged with it being a black & white film, through the start that is a little uncomfortable but after a while you won't even realise it. Having been made in the 1950's it is a rarity to see a film having a run time under 100 minutes.
There are very few if any aspects that can be deemed disappointing. 12 Angry Men is a must watch for everyone, it may be an old classic but its content is relevant even today.

552,lllinggg,Masterpiece Nearing Perfection,8,1 August 2003,"It has been described as ""flawless"", ""immaculate"" and ""supreme"" -and for good reason. '12 Angry Men' is an old Swiss golden clock in the age of Japanese digital watches, a Flemish renaissance mahogany armchair in the era of prefabricated furniture, a handcrafted motion picture at a time of processed film-making. Henry Fonda is the sole dissenting juror in a murder case, who utilizes rational methodology to convince the remaining eleven jurors that the accused is not guilty as charged. Filming almost exclusively in a small, nondescript jury deliberation room, director Sidney Lumet produces a masterpiece of American film-making, reaching the limits of structured cinematic delivery. The opening segment, which rolls uncut for over 10 minutes, is unparalleled, as is the dramatic sequence of the murder recreation. Assisted by an outstanding theatrical script, the film's cast members literally forget to act, allowing their roles as jurors to inhabit their conscience as they perform. Notably, E.G. Marshall (juror #4) splendidly captures the essence of his role as a prudent financier, while Lee J. Cobb (juror #3) writes cinematic history with his phenomenal portrayal of Fonda's leading adversary among the jury. Last but not least, the film's didactic quality is multifaceted, on the one hand illustrating how educated citizens can guide, rather than endure, the democratic process, and on the other hand illuminating how moral purpose and artistic dedication can guide a film's production in ways Hollywood creators often choose to neglect. Overall, a solid film that has earned the respect of successive generations of movie audiences.",12 Angry Men
553,Rosser94,Simple but fantastic; it's old age is irrelevant,9,19 March 2012,"The concept of this film is incredibly simple, as are the sets throughout. However, this is why the fact that this film is over 50 years old, is completely irrelevant to how enjoyable it is today.Despite of the fact that this is not an action film, it is engaging, exciting and tense from start to finish and manages to stay highly entertaining throughout in the most subtle, intelligent manner I've seen in cinema. This is achieved through absolutely fantastic characterisation; each of the 12 men the movie centres around are individuals who are void of any tedious stereotypes that most of the shallow characters we see in cinema today will fit into. Every one of these characters are complex, controversial and interesting. This is contributed to hugely by the fact that each and every role taken in this film is acted tremendously; it would be unfair to highlight a single great performance as every member of the cast is just sensational.In addition to this, the script gives an authenticity and realism to the movie; we can relate to and believe every situation on-screen, which is what makes this such edge-of-seat stuff. Furthermore, the film could not be paced any more perfectly; as a result, the running time flies by.Although this is, undoubtedly, a necessary watch for anybody, I could not give it a 10/10 purely because I felt that the direction of the plot and the nature of some aspects of character changes were a bit too predictable; I had a pretty good idea what was going to be different from the beginning of the movie and the end.Overall, I believe that the unrivalled characterisation and simplistic thrills of this incredibly authentic, intelligent movie, render it a must-watch.

554,fayremead,"11 answers for ""know what I mean?""",9,16 September 2008,"""12 Angry Men"" is the antithesis of today's blockbusters and blockbuster-wannabes. The successful action movies trim their dialog in favor of chases, fights and stunts. Many films which depend on dialog have a lot of empty chatter.The twelve actors in Sidney Lumet's jury room face no such emptiness. Every line in the film either contributes to the case (deciding whether or not an accused murderer is guilty) or says something about the speaker. All of the actors make their characters live in verbal and silent moments.An early example of an actor silently projecting his character comes when E.G. Marshall (Juror #4) ignores a fellow's attempt to hand him a business card. #4 comes across as a person who feels infallible and superior to everyone else whether or not he speaks. His imperfections are sweated out (literally) over the debate that follows; he responds by using his listening and speaking skills better.Meanwhile, #10 (Ed Begley in the difficult role of humanizing an unrepentant bigot) becomes the angriest juror for a while. He's sociable at first, and he did pay attention during the trial (as is evident when he points out facts to the dissenting #8, played by Henry Fonda). But he contributes little substance to the deliberations. His favorite phrase, ""know what I mean?"", always comes at the end of a complaint or a bigoted remark. Finally he goes on a rant which antagonizes all of the other jurors (even Lee J. Cobb's seemingly similar #3).Most of them react by leaving the table. Jack Klugman's slum dweller (#5) goes first. Jack Warden as the ""I couldn't care less about the case, let me go to the ball game"" #7 slouches in his chair. The only other juror who stays seated is #4, still in the ""Guilty"" camp but already a changed man, and he utters a devastating counterpoint to the other jurors' silence.#10 retreats to a corner, too ashamed to return to the table. He may never express his bigotry so openly again, although he will always be closed-minded (books are at hand where he sits, but he doesn't touch them).When 12 actors talk in a room for an hour and a half without a moment of tedium, full marks go to all twelve along with writer Reginald Rose and director Sidney Lumet.-Tony",12 Angry Men

And I'm a fan of Henry Fonda and Jack Klugman. My problem is I'm puzzled that this film has such a high ranking on IMDb ? I can think of at least 10 better films (in my opinion) that are ranked far below this one. This is a classic film and I think it's well made and still holds up after 50+ years. I guess I just had high expectations for a movie in the IMDb top 10. It sounds silly but I think I would have enjoyed it more if was rated 200th !-Randawg.,12 Angry Men

565,Misterhustler,A cerebral experience,8,13 November 2010,This movie proves that a good story and a tight script are more important than any other thing for a movie to succeed. Sidney Lumet was already experienced when he directed this movie but still 12 Angry Men is an amazing first film. Henry Fonda is the main dissenter from the jury who tries to convince others that the case is not as simple as it appears. Joseph Sweeney who plays the role of the old man also does a remarkable job. The movie proves that a defendant has the right to a fair trial regardless of his social or economic status. I wish this movie could be shown in every law school so that lawyers and judges can understand the gravity and importance of their decisions. The movie is more than 50 years old but still feels fresh and is also a must watch for anyone who loves good cinema and for people interested in film making. This is also a perfect example of a simple yet powerful movie that will stay in the minds of the audiences. I can bet that anyone who has seen this movie will not be able to forget it easily.,12 Angry Men

Recommended",9,13 November 2009,"For some reason I had not heard of this film before I sat down to watch it with my fiancée last night. I'm ashamed to admit that I can sometimes be reluctant to sit down on a weeknight and watch a wordy, black-and-white film; when my fiancée explained to me that the entire movie is set in one room I sighed and settled myself in for the long haul.Luckily what I watched was a brilliantly made, flawlessly acted masterpiece of tension that would not let me drift from the screen for even a single second. I have honestly not seen such an ensemble of brilliant actors working together like that for a long long time, if ever. This is a superb film and one that has left me thinking deeply about it, and looking forward to seeing it again.If there is one gripe it would be that some of the points raised by Henry Fonda as the original dissenting voice among the jurors, would surely have been made by even a bad defence lawyer (finding out whether the only eyewitness to the murder wore glasses, for example); but the point here is not the innocence or guilt of the boy, but the motives of the men in reaching their opinions on his guilt.""Twelve Angry Men"" is a brilliant set of character studies and one of the finest films I have ever seen.

567,Alexandar,"One angry woman vs. ""12 Angry Men""?",10,1 March 2006,"12 Angry Men (1957)**** In 1957. following five films were in the competition for the Best Picture Academy Award: David Lean's ""Bridge on the River Kwai"", Joshua Lagan's ""Sayonara"", Mark Robson's ""Peyton Place"", Sidney Lumet's ""12 Angry Men"" and Billy Wilder's ""Witness for the Prosecution"". Pretty impressive list. Not surprisingly, Oscar went to BridgeThe last two (12 Angry Men and Witness for the Prosecution) were both exciting and intense courtroom dramas. 12 Angry Men, written by Reginald Rose, was about 12 jurors with not an easy task  to decide whether a young man is guilty or innocent on the charge of murder. Their decision must be unanimous. Witness for the Prosecution was a complex, unpredictable and full-of-surprises mystery from the novel written by famous Agatha Christie. Both excellent movies.Somewhere I read that Agatha Christie once said something like:12 Angry Men is an awfully stupid movie because it is not operating with the facts but only with the jurors' presumptions. I don't know whether she really said that (she'll excuse me if not) but this is rather pseudo-argument.Although it is true that the jurors are operating rather with ""ideas"" than ""facts"" in this film this is certainly not a flaw or weakness.Almost everything seems clear after the trial and jurors vote 11:1 for ""guilty"". Only, juror #8 (Henry Fonda) votes ""innocent"" not because he think he is but because he think that the boy deserves some discussion. Slowly, toward the end, one by one, all judges change their votes as a result of a long, intense discussions and quarrels.These discussions are the battle of nerves, personal observations, prejudices, moralities  in a word  characters. Because there is a little fact, jurors are forced to project their own perspectives. This is very significant, since it is happening in all courts and among all judges.While all the judges, one by one, reveal their thoughts, there is absolutely brilliant, detailed and consistent character development in this film. Also, since the judges are from the various backgrounds there's a superb representation of American society. In addition with the great directorial effort from Lumet (in his debut!), who made great atmosphere using special lenses, long cadres and extracting the maximum from the actors, we have a truly unforgettable film.Agatha Christie maybe created the great plot (also clever dialog) in Witness for the Prosecution, but ""12 Angry Men"" is digging much deeper.",12 Angry Men

I follow the story well and attracted to find it till the end.It may be a drama movie but the crime story catch me a lot. The way the director presented the development of the story is top of the class. The story flows constantly. Every details was included neatly.

But, I couldn't find any. Every part of it looked natural and I admired it. Splendid.Its story shows us how impact and self-influence is not only about power and authority. Look how Henry Fonda in this movie influenced the other 11 jurors and made them all agree with him. That's fascinating. This movie teaches us that in order to influence others or to make people listen to us, we have to listen first and then speak with noble way and rationally accepted argument.

However, when one of them decides the other way, each one must face their own prejudices and moral burdens as reality is put into trial. It deals with multiple themes. most importantly the idea of democracy, racism, xenophobia and the dangers of preconceived ideas.

592,goddangwatir,Not your standard thriller !,9,1 March 2020,"12 Angry Men is a very different thriller, it isn't even classified as one here on IMDb. But it is still a thriller nontheless, since it thrills, and boy does it thrill well !It has no hidden bombs ready to detonate, no climactic shootout, no heroes getting imprisoned in the lair of the villains, but the suspense comes from one simple thing: the dialouge.12 Angry Men is built on one of the better screenplays I have seen, and that is quite a feat since 90% of the movie takes place in one single room. But that is perhaps what makes it so tense and so great; the fact that you are stuck in one room with twelve very differing jurors divided into two groups, each of them trying to debunk the arguments of the opposing side over one question; is a teen convicted of first-degree murder guilty, or not guilty ? The heated conversations between the twelve delivers constant curveballs and plot twists, some quite shocking.What I also love about the movie is the fact that it all seems like one take (comparisons can be made with the recent 1917 (2019), but perhaps not to the same extent). The excellent editing and the brilliant acting by all twelve jurors make sure of this.I have seen people complaining over the lack of music in 12 Angry Men, but in my opinion, the dialouge serves as the music, if that makes any sense. It is a pure delight to listen to.To conclude, 12 Angry Men is one of the best and most suspenseful movies I have ever seen, but in a very different way. It is a great shame that it is not as widely avaliable as some other highly rated IMDb titles, but perhaps that only adds to its factor of exclusivity.10/10",12 Angry Men

597,harfordamanda,top of the top,10,15 February 2010,"Simplicity can be complex if you work at it and 12 Angry Men is a perfect example of just that. The first time I saw it was in my civics class my freshman year of high school and unlike my other classmates who saw it boring and dull I was for lack of a better word riveted and here's why: The beginning of the film brings you into the tail end of a trial about a teenage boy who's accused of murdering his father. The evidence is a switchblade knife and the testimony of a old man and woman who heard and allegedly witnessed the crime. The Judge sets the tone for the film explaining that the ""jury"" (you included) have to decide whether the boy is guilty or not guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The jurors descend into the confines of the jury room and are locked in until the verdict is made. Most of the men automatically deem the defendant guilty just because they want to leave and a few because of the evidence which consisted of the eye witness testimony. When the first vote is taken Henry Fonda (juror #8) is the only one who says not guilty but not because he thinks he not guilty or guilty but because he isn't sure. The film then progresses into Fonda breaking the case down to the others and slowly but surely guiding the others into a verdict of not guilty all except juror 10 and 7. After some heated prejudicial and racial words eventually all become convinced of the kid's innocence. The very end of the film concludes that men go their separate way revealing only 2 of the men's names and the picture ends.The great thing about the 12.A.M is that you really need no information on the case, the trial, or the testimony you solely rely on the jurors showing that a little usually means a lot. I think it's a wonderful movie with a brilliant classic cast including the man behind the voice of Winnie the Pooh's Piglet (you'll know it when you hear him) and of course the incomparable Henry Fonda.

It is also a story of doubt, fairness, intellect, heart, and as Lincoln noted, it is about ""...the better Angels of our nature...."".Twelve ordinary Men, who normally would have little to do with each other, or exist in each others orbits, are required to make a judgement on the life or death of a young 18 year old man-boyThe fact that this is twelve middle and upper middle class White Men judging a Porto Rican Teenager is a ""quiet"" racism that is an undertone throughout this film.As in many times in its history the idea of what it means to ""be"" an American, and what direct is the future of America, is at play here, the Porto Rican boy is the future, the now is an urban scene of poverty, immigrants, crime, street gangs, and violence.To the men who are in this court, this is just one more newspaper article and one more example of American urban life ( read White Male American life ) eroding by forces they feel are beyond their grasp, and yet here is an apparent cut-and-dried crime they feel is understandable and something they can do something about.It is a film about the wonderful part of America, the part that is its true difference, not its strength, not is power, not its culture, but instead it is a film about a system of laws and governance where the ability of people to understand each other, and themselves, can take place, and where one individual can make a difference for the good of everyone.",12 Angry Men
601,coolfasho-1,A testament to the proprieties of law,10,22 June 2007,"12 Angry Men does not obfuscate its theme with superficial clash-and-bang, chill instilling spoofs which leave viewers tremulous after the feature like sweet chocs leave children appeased yet inevitably desirous of more. Exploitation of special effects and the plethora of augments which bog Hollywood main-stream projections leaving the essence of the plot line non-existent or heavily in question is not exercised in Sidney Lumet's sublime and profound production. 12 Angry Men plays spontaneously in accordance with the nuances of a dozen jurors who have, placed before them, a case which involves powerful yet questionable evidence against a young man who presumably murders his father. Eleven of the jurors find the testimonials of the only two alleged witnesses incontrovertible while one dares to differ and hence through impartiality and a strive to revivify the loose pieces of evidence which feebly serve to incriminate the accused, bolsters the rest of the reluctant jurors to spend several hours of self-sacrificed time for arriving at the most logical conclusion. The performances in the film are starkly genuine and each actor fits his respective role like a glove. No other film of it's classical era and genre may best serve to enlighten, entertain and stupefy you than this internationally loved and strongly enduring saga of courage, recalcitrance and what it means to indulge a reasonable doubt in a situation of life and death.",12 Angry Men
602,andymcgraw-95291,Worth seeing one time,9,7 February 2018,"12 Angry Men is worth seeing once, but I would not watch it again. I saw this movie in high school. I remember the angle that the stab wound was inflicted being a major turning point, in the film, for one of the jury members. I think it all started with most of them thinking that the accused was guilty, but one stubborn juror would not be coaxed by limited time and by being rushed by the other jurors to allow justice to not be served that day. Beyond that, nothing in the movie stands out.

Gasp, not a single car chase through the streets, no automatic weapons barrages, no plate glass windows being shattered and, of course, that staple of today's entertainment, the obligatory explosion. Lord, imagine a movie without an explosion. Why the thought is positively Bolshevik!Is it ancient history, or wasn't there a time when films with great acting and compelling plots were produced that were not ""independent"" films?  On second thought, maybe I'm confused, perhaps that was back in Periclean Athens. Can't wait for Lethal Weapon 5.

Everyone should watch this movie and think for hours and days, maybe the truth is hidden from our eyes",12 Angry Men
607,icclyf,Classic,9,3 July 2020,"I watched this film for the first time, when it was shown at about 1 o'clock in the morning. I made an effort to see it as it is rated as one of the best movies ever made, however I must admit that I watched it with a sense of reluctance as I'm not a great one for old ""classics"". This film blew me away however; how ignorant can I be about old films? How many other pre-1960s gems are there out there that I haven't seen? What strikes me most about this film is how progressive it is for its day. Indeed the issues this film makes about American society of the 1950s, still ring true for western society today. This film concerns twelve jurors debating the sentence of an 18 year old Puerto Rican boy who on the face of it, has no real alibi. However one man, played brilliantly by Henry Fonda, is ill-at ease putting a young boy to death without even debating his case, much to the despair of the other jurors. What follows is a brilliant piece of film making, slowly revealing many of the juror's complex characters to the audience as they react to Fonda's concerns with their own mix of metal scars, prejudices and insecurities. What especially struck me about this film is how ordinary most of the characters are, none of the jurors are shown to be especially bad men, indeed most are portrayed as honest everyman type people. The use of ordinary characters is the films master-stroke because as one by one they begin to question their initial instincts, the flaws of society that have let this Puerto Rican boy down are presented to the audience. Tragically it appears that many of the issues that were beginning to be discussed in the 1950s have only got worse. For me there is one immortal comment in this film: one of the jurors, a man in his 50s says that the youths of today have no respect and have changed so much for the worse since his day. How ironic is it that some grumpy old men of today who may not even of have been born when this films was made, still say exactly the same thing? Finally a quick look at the cast shows that Fonda aside many of the cast were only moderately successful after this film. I think that's a shame as everyone of these actors is excellent and plays their part in making it one of the best films of all time. However within the cast there are a couple of treats; look out for Jack Klugman (Quincy) and John Fieldler who is the voice of many of Disney's characters such as Piglet. I urge you all, if you have not yet seen this film, please do so now.",12 Angry Men
608,teacherlogan,"Fantastic, provocative writing",10,15 February 2007,"You wouldn't think that 12 men in a tiny room would produce so much drama, so much passion and such a compelling film. But 12 Angry Men is a unique film. It's a roller-coaster ride that never leaves the jury room. 12 Angry Men presents us with a jury that has been given a murder case. A man has been stabbed to death and his son is the prime suspect. As these strangers take an initial vote to see where they stand, a lone juror stands between them and a quick conviction. Deliberations begin; sometimes civil, sometimes heated as the 12 men attempt to reach a unanimous decision.I truly admire this film for what Henry Fonda's character represents. He is an idealist. He has convictions (no pun intended). A lone juror standing between eleven men and an easy guilty verdict. He believes in a jury system where they discuss the verdict, not just vote. It would have been so easy to simply agree with the room. The boy is probably guilty. Everyone seems to know it. But he wants to talk. Discuss the case for an hour.The collection of jurors is perfect because they are so 'imperfect'. A collection of businessmen, laborers and immigrants that makes this jury what juries should be; a representation of society. Every character has his own perceptions, his own biases; and those opinions are brought out through magnificent dialog that is under-appreciated in today's cinema. We know very little about the jurors, in many cases we don't even know their names. But we know many of their occupations and, more importantly, we know their beliefs, manifested in the stance that each character takes, or doesn't take, as they discus the trial.As excellent as the casting is, I credit the writing for instilling the drama. Every sentence is constructed flawlessly. The flow of this movie is brilliant, again considering that virtually every passionate scene is delivered within a confined space.This film is simple and real. The jurors get emotional, tired and frustrated; as would be expected locked in a room for hours on end. We understand the stress these men are under. We understand the anger each character is feeling, justified or not. We feel uncomfortable during a racial tirade, as though we were in the jury room unable to escape his bigotry. I think movies that make us feel uncomfortable have succeeded admirably.In a world where special effects, explosions and profanity are commonplace, excellent writing and flawless delivery is missing; or extraordinary when displayed. A movie where 12 men never leave one room would probably never hold today's audiences. That is a shame. Movies that stand the test of time, as this one has, do so through the emotion that is expressed by the characters and empathized with the audience.I will leave the bulk of the plot of this film for your enjoyment, although the logic with which Henry Fonda's character reviews the prosecution's case is deliberate and fascinating. The characters are the plot. They drive the story by their actions and words. That is the focus of this film; action and words. Brilliant words.",12 Angry Men
609,jugrin,It was an excellent movie; my all time favorite.,10,27 December 2001,"It is an extremely good study of human character.  The lives of the 12 jurors are encapsulated in their views, prejudices, thoughts and actions. The movie had a lot of strong feelings shown with no strong language.  It shows what good writing, acting and directing can do to show people's feelings without resorting to vile language.  It showed as much anger as was necessary and not a trace of R rating language was necessary.",12 Angry Men

I had already seen the TV version starring Jack Lemmon as Juror # 8 which I enjoyed.  This movie was much better.  The acting spectacular.  Every character turns in a top notch performance, and Lee J. Cobb is spectacular.  Very similar to the TV adaptation, but different in the execution of the picture.  I was highly impressed.

It is also in my view, Henry Fonda's best role.I think what I liked more than anything else in this film, is Henry Fonda sticking his neck out from the crowd, standing for what is right and what is just, against the ridicule of others.Directed by Sidney Lumet in 1957, and produced by Henry Fonda himself, this is a masterpiece of cinema and acting. Any half decent bloke watching Fonda play his part, will likely as not relate to Fonda 100 per cent.If you only ever get the chance to watch one more movie your whole life, watch 12 Angry Men starring Henry Fonda, made in 1957.",12 Angry Men

At the beginning of the process, only one of the members chose that the parties involved in the case were innocent, and all the other members stood against him. As the discussion developed, people were persuaded by him and chose to join him. The outcome, of course, is predictable: everyone will be persuaded. But what I want to say is that this is a movie that got the ending right and didn't get the ending right. Even if there are only some debates and arguments in the process of guessing the right one, and maybe some use of force to match the title of the movie (12 angry men), it will be attracted by the legal system and democracy shown in the movie, by the different jury systems in China and the west, and by the wonderful debates among the twelve characters with different personalities.",12 Angry Men

Every step the movie takes forces you to reevaluate and adjust your judgement of rationality. The 12 characters enable the person behind the screen the ability to be a part of the learning process that is cultivated by Juror #8, and it is done flawlessly.Did you know that in the movie, they incrementally demolished the walls and moved them in to create more tension?

It had been mentioned that all but 3 minutes of the movie has been shot in a room. The movie was black and white and there was no female cast!!.  Finally when I found some time when there was no other thing to do, I watched this movie, my god I was hooked. This movie is a great lesson to new directors and screen play writers as to how a great movie can be made without all the gorgeous locations, millions of dolllars, graphic special effects etc. Infact once the cast get into the jury room there is not even a back ground score. All natural sound recorded at the set. As some body else had mentioned Lee J cobb steals most of the scenes, but Henry Fonda's performance is great as a soft sell/submissive player. He carefully releases one card after other from his hand at precise moments.
For example he does not tell any one he has a switch blade knife untill others really push him and challenge him about the rarity of the knife. That is a genius. Infact I watched the movie two times back to back and I could not help but marvel where all this talent nowadays. I was tempted to watch it third successive time but did not do it because it was late.A must watch. Don't miss it",12 Angry Men
616,cool-bhargava,Simplicity At It's Best!,9,30 April 2009,It's undoubtedly one of the finest works of cinema directed my Sidney Lumet. The actors portray the characters that they depict so wonderfully with such brilliance that one tends to get totally engrossed in the film and script. The script should be appreciated for it's simplicity- 12 Jurors and just one room. The audience gets tense and sweats in suspense as the final verdict comes closer. And also a great work of camera is done by Boris Kauffman where he makes the screen less wide as the end approaches that the viewer too gets the feel of the tension and the claustrophobia.

Almost the entire film takes place in a single room - the jury room of a murder trial during deliberations. There's no need for spoilers here as the plot is obvious once you know the premise - the various characters try to convince the others as the balance ebbs and flows toward guilty or not guilty. You'll probably even quickly guess the final result, but as is often the case, the journey is more interesting than the destination.

The scene is painted in black and white, there are few shades of gray. Most of the character are stereotypes-- ie, the bigot, the bully, the nerd, the immigrant, the glad-handing but uncaring salesman, etc. It is a tribute to the fine actors that they bring such one-dimensional characters to life. And shining through it all is the oh so good man who has right, justice, and the American way on his side.

Then the 12 jurors go to a room to discuss the trial. And after they decide the boys fate the movie ends. Get a cast and crew of 20 talented people, and you can make it yourself.The jurors discuss at length the events of the trial, as well as the crime which lead to it, all without any flashback scenes. When I first heard of it, I was worried it was going to be boring, but with strong performances from all jurors, great camera work, and a compelling case, I found myself under the trance of this masterpiece.It's not always a comfortable movie. The jurors are constantly yelling, the camera is claustrophobic, and the characters get sweaty, and it captures the jurors just perfectly.

634,suburbannightmare,"""You don't really mean you'll kill me, do you?""",10,7 April 2009,"A pure, simple, undeniable classic. This movie is a thoughtful, well shot, amazingly scripted, fantastically acted masterpiece. Even though the word masterpiece is often over-used (like genius) it certainly, and without dispute applies in this case. Sidney Lumet's directing is top-notch, and Henry Fonda is the still turning point of this small, microcosmic little world - his role has to be one of the most finely acted ever committed to film.Set in an actual New York jury room, it's a claustrophobic, tightly confined set, where 12 very different men deliberate over the guilt of a young boy. Their prejudices, morals and personalities are thrown together and, sometimes violently, clash. Along with a great parallel commentary from the weather (at the beginning of the film, it's a stuffy, oppressive sweatbox, which becomes sidelined by a dark, stormy maelstrom outside the jury room) this is a fantastic film. You'd never think there were so many angles you could get from one single, uncomfortably confining room. Sidney Lumet's directing is amazing, as Fonda's chain-smkoing, softly spoken moralistic character could have been played so much darker; he manages to turn everyone around, slowly but surely, almost effortlessly converting even the most staunchly opposed and stoic juror - but he's not manipulative, sly or underhanded about it. He simply presents what is - he's the pure voice of reason, and he has some cracking lines. The other jurors are great, too. I'm sure we all know someone who fidgets through something important because they've got a football game starting in ten minutes - they all highlight broad generalisations of very human characters. I defy anyone not to find a character that illustrates someone they know in this motley crue. Except maybe Fonda - I don't know anyone cooler than this guy.",12 Angry Men

Even with all the testimonies not as reliable as they seemed in the beginning, who else could have done it?Although very interesting from a sociological as well as psychological perspective (it was the Freudian epoch, you can tell by every second line), 12 Angry Men leaves a bad taste in your mouth because in the end Henry Fonda saved a murderer, AND HE KNEW IT ALL THE TIME. He was just against the death penalty, and very cleverly persuaded (manipulated) the jury employing group psychology. However any reasonable member would have sticked to his opinion. Some of them just wavered to easily, which is another flaw of this still quite good and interesting classic. 5/10.",12 Angry Men

This movie is a major proof of this principle. ""12 Angry Men"" is theater on the big screen: one single scenery during most of the film (except at the end), real-time narrative, 12 characters involved: 1 is your favorite because he represents all the good ideals (honesty, loyalty, etcetera) and the philosophy of Descartes: doubt about everything they tell you. By the other hand, there's also the complete opposite of this hero: racist, closed, liar and cold-blooded. Simple basic theatrical characters, written to make people think. Why does this work in this film? Because the script is so well written that you don't care about anything else than being on Henry Fonda's side during the entire feature. And of course, trying to enter to the movie and shoot Lee J. Cobb's character. Usually, when I watch a movie, I try to pay attention to every detail: direction, writing, editing, photography, etcetera. But this one kept me on the edge of the seat the whole time, waiting for the final verdict to come. You don't even care if the film is in black an white or whether it has no music at all.

I find it ridiculous that a juror would bring up the marks on the nose, then conjecture the wearing of glasses, and follow that up with proposing the woman could not have seen what she said she saw (and again, despite her testimony going unchallenged or otherwise not refuted in court), and then the other jurors one by one agree, until they have all decided to completely dismiss eyewitness testimony!Likewise the ""ear-witness"" testimony, where a man who, apparently from what we know from the film, knew the boy and recognized his voice as arguing with his father upstairs, and upon hearing what sounded like a crash of a body on the floor, went out in the hall, saw the boy fleeing downstairs and outside, and then went upstairs to discover the stabbed father.His testimony was dismissed because he wears shabby clothes and is old and is probably just seeking attention!I like Henry Fonda too, but not that much.",12 Angry Men

I, for one, was neither ready for nor expectant of such a treat when I started watching ""12 Angry Men"". But boy, did it hold my attention within that short span!Let me be frank with you. These days I am on a Top-250-movie watching spree. But half of these so-called masterpieces are just packaged trash- packaged either with drugs, sex, homosexuality, underworld, etc. Barring these, there is not much to boast of in most of these movies. I watched Raging Bull and just could not make head or tail of it. I mean, I being an avid movie-watcher, had there been anything excellent about the movie, it would have made itself obvious. Also my expectations for the movie were rather too high. But I just could not bring myself to like this movie. But 12 Angry Men indeed means business when it comes to story, performances and meaning! The focus is entirely on the jury of a murder trial and whether the accused does deserve a benefit of doubt in a previously thought open-and-shut case. As one man is unconvinced of the accused boy's guilt, he elicits his reasons and calls for a discussion. I must mention that character-etching at this point of the movie becomes very important and the movie does excel in this particular requirement. Each of the jurors have a distinctive personality and their own prejudices or indifference. Nothing is forced to churn out a performance, each character dons his role comfortably. There is the leader of the group who drives the discussion smoothly, there is a shy, polite timid person who must always respectfully address others even when angry but still speak out his mind, there is the man who is convinced of the boy's guilt out of personal prejudice, there is the loudmouth old guy who belittles certain people, there are the rational men like the man who was raised in a slum, the painter and others, and there is the man who has no interest whatsoever in the matter. And there is Henry Fonda as the man who is the voice of reason in the entire jury.The storytelling is riveting and at the end of it, I was yearning for more. A simple but outstanding movie!

He started his career as a stage actor and gradually became one of the most matured actors of Hollywood at that time.12 angry men is undoubtedly one of the major milestones of his career. his biography as a source i came to know that 12 angry men was the only film that he produced in his entire film career. Due to the disappointing performance of the movie at the box office Fonda decided never to produce a movie again. but this film was critically well acclaimed and after watching the movie i understood why is it so....if you wanna ask for my personal opinion about this film then i only want to say that _ if you want to learn how to make a low budget masterpiece then there are numerous lessons that you can come across after watching this film.yes, some people may say that this film is more than 50 years old (black & white, of course) and will not match up with the expected standards of the new generation.

It is not set in the courtroom itself, but rather the film deals with the jury, and it's attempts to reach a verdict in the trial they've been assigned.Henry Fonda plays the part of a juror who does not necessarily dissent at first. He simply feels that the other 11 jurors ought to talk for a few minutes about the trial. What builds from his few initial questions forms the basis for all the tension that comes later.The entire film is shot in only two rooms, a large deliberation room and a bathroom. I believe there are a few exterior shots at the beginning, and there are a few at the end, outside the courthouse. There is little of anything to work with here in the way of props and settings, so you know that the acting must be excellent in order to hold everybody's attention for over an hour and a half.

645,juho69,Simple but great.,9,23 October 2004,"'12 Angry Men' is an outstanding film. It is proof that, for a film to be great, it does not need extensive scenery, elaborate costumes or expensive special effects - just superlative acting.The twelve angry men are the twelve jurors of a murder case. An eighteen-year-old boy from a slum background is accused of stabbing his father to death and faces the electric chair if convicted. Eleven of the men believe the boy to be guilty; only one (Henry Fonda) has doubts. Can he manage to convince the others?The court case provides only a framework, however. The film's greatness lies in its bringing-together of twelve different men who have never met each other before and the interaction of their characters as each man brings his own background and life experiences into the case. Thus, we have the hesitant football coach (Martin Balsam), the shy, uncertain bank clerk (John Fiedler), the aggressive call company director (Lee J. Cobb), the authoritative broker (E.G. Marshall), the self-conscious slum dweller (Jack Klugman), the solid, dependable painter (Edward Binns), the selfish salesman (Jack Warden), the calm, collected architect (Fonda), the thoughtful, observant older man (Joseph Sweeney), the racially bigoted garage owner (Ed Begley), the East European watchmaker (George Voskovec) and the beefcake advertising agent (Robert Webber) who has plenty of chat and little else.Almost the entire film takes place in just one room, the jury room, where the men have retired to consider their verdict. The viewer finds him or herself sweating it out with the jury as the heat rises, literally and metaphorically, among the men as they make their way towards their final verdict. Interestingly, the jurors (apart from two at the end) are never named. They do not need to be. Their characters speak for them.Henry Fonda is eminently suitable and excellently believable as the dissenter who brings home the importance of a jury's duty to examine evidence thoroughly and without prejudice. Joseph Sweeney is delightful as Juror No. 9, the quiet but shrewd old man who misses nothing, whilst E.G. Marshall brings his usual firmness and authority to the role of Juror No. 4. All the actors shine but perhaps the best performance is that of Lee J. Cobb as Juror No. 3, the hard, stubborn, aggressive, vindictive avenger who is reduced to breaking down when forced to confront the failure of his relationship with his own son.Several of the stars of '12 Angry Men' became household names. Henry Fonda continued his distinguished career until his death in 1982, as well as fathering Jane and Peter. Lee J. Cobb landed the major role of Judge Henry Garth in 'The Virginian'. E.G. Marshall enjoyed a long, reputable career on film and t.v., including playing Joseph P. Kennedy in the 'Kennedy' mini-series. Jack Klugman was 'Quincy' whilst John Fiedler voiced Piglet in the 'Winnie The Pooh' films and cartoons.Of the twelve, only John Fiedler, Jack Klugman and Jack Warden* are still alive. Although around the eighty mark, they are all still acting. The film was still available on video last year and it is shown on t.v. fairly frequently. I cannot recommend it too highly!(*John Fiedler died June 2005. Jack Warden died July 2006.)",12 Angry Men

Sure, I will read through them with pleasure.Frankly, there isn't really a single thing about this movie that I didn't like. The fact that the real deed and the so called facts, can hardly ever be known, and are never revealed to the audience, makes it even better. The only fact is that there are no facts, only suspicions...Consider me a 13th angry man for just one moment. When laying down only the very superficial facts and describing the kids background as they did in the beginning, my vote would be guilty as enough evidence supports the outcome. However, it only took until the fact turned into a story for the first time, for me to change thoughts. He went out for a drink with some friends (obviously in a bad mood), then lost his knife... From this point (very early in the movie) forward, I was already convinced that any of these so called 'slums' could have taken the responsibility on himself to kill the kid's dad for putting up the irresponsible behavior that probably led to the kid himself becoming a criminal. From there on my suspicion of him not being guilty only increased with the minute, until the point where they proof the woman might have seen any kid his height (but probably with worse knife skills) stab the dad to death, where I became very convinced there is no point to convince him with such poor evidence.",12 Angry Men

650,MaccyXpert,"Juror #8, the hero (Pt. 1)",9,13 March 2021,"Standing as arguably one of the greatest courtroom dramas ever created, 12 Angry Men tells the story of one juror who attempts to convince his fellow jurors to question the guilt of a boy accused of murdering his father; as the pressure rises in the jury room, the natures of some of the men - with their deeply ingrained biases and prejudices - are laid bare for the others to see and judge, as they ultimately but onerously come to a verdict of not guilty. The conflicts between this one juror - Juror #8 - and the others represent conflicts between dichotomous forces such as individualism, collectivism, certainty, doubt, and more; these themes and motifs are both explored and judged by the film through the medium of its characters, the twelve jurors.The introduction of the jurors expertly foreshadows their eventual attitude towards the verdict, as seen in the depictions of Juror #8, Juror #3 and Juror #10, with the latter two coming to be the primary antagonists of this film. While the jurors are sitting in the courtroom and having their duties as jurors outlined to them by the judge, Juror #8's expression implies deep thought and a sincere belief in the gravity of this case, in which a guilty verdict would result in the accused boy being put to death. Meanwhile, Juror #3 is the first man to stand up after the jury is told to begin their deliberations, hinting at a let's-get-this-over-with attitude that is underscored by an almost unshakeable belief in the boy's guilt, a belief that drives him to become fervently defensive as the other jurors begin to side with Juror #8 throughout their time in the jury room.Once the deliberations begin, Juror #3 begins to reveal a personal bias that comes to fuel his emotional instability - his own fractured relationship with his son. He details this relationship briefly in front of Juror #8 before concluding with the phrase, ""Work your heart out,"" and trailing off as he realises that he has said too much. Here - along with when Juror #3 told Juror #2 that he would like to ""slap those tough kids down before they start any trouble"" - we see that Juror #3 is projecting the blame for the failure of his relationship with his son onto the accused boy, for an admission that the boy's father may have contributed to his murderous state of mind would constitute an implicit admission of Juror #3's own guilt in estranging his son from him.Juror #8 also begins to make his arguments as to why he cannot be certain of the boy's guilt by listing the unjust circumstances with which the boy had to cope during his childhood, displaying an empathy that is nowhere to be seen in Juror #10's comment that members of the boy's ethnic group are, ""born liars,"" and thus that the boy on trial is no different from the rest of them.The first dichotomy presented in this interaction - to use the technical terminology - is one of sociological positivism versus innatism; either responsibility for the individual's actions lies partially with the circumstances and partially with the individual, or it lies entirely with the individual, in whom the tendency towards criminality is permanently ingrained due to an accident of birth. The second dichotomy, however, is the one that is more relevant to the carriage of justice, that of individualism versus collectivism - is the boy to be judged according to his own actions in the past and the present, or is he to be judged deterministically according to his ethnicity and socioeconomic class?The former positions in these dichotomies - both of which are taken by Juror #8 - constitute a more compassionate and fair judgement of the boy's actions, while Juror #10's positions make leniency impossible; in this way, Juror #8 stands out as the film's primarily humanistic and individualistic character, as a man who is both personal yet impersonal - given his lack of bias - in his approach to the case.As the tension begins to rise among the jurors, each man's nature begins to reveal itself in further detail. When Juror #6 suggests to Juror #8 that he may be letting a guilty boy get away with murder, Juror #8 is left looking doubtful, likely considering Juror #6's suggestion as a genuine possibility; after all, Juror #8's approach has not been to insist that the boy is definitively innocent, but instead to question the assertion that the boy is definitively guilty. Here, we see yet another of the film's dichotomies - the insistence on absolute certainty that Juror #3 and Juror #10 bring to the table contrasted with the room for reasonable doubt that Juror #8 creates in the other jurors' minds. Juror #8 is a force of chaos who has the potential to destabilise the rigid and unyielding order upheld by Juror #3 and Juror #10, and the latter two's hostility towards inquisitiveness is merely driven by a desire to protect that order.Juror #3 reveals his own dogmatism after Juror #11 questions why the boy would return to his apartment after allegedly killing his father, which prompts the former to ask the latter, ""Look, you voted guilty. Whose side are you on?"" In Juror #3's mind, there is no room for reasonable doubt, because doubting the boy's guilt is inherently unreasonable, and anybody who is on the side of 'guilty' who dares to show any kind of hesitancy must instead be on the side of 'not guilty', as if the jurors are at war rather than mutually attempting to come to a consensus on the guilt of the accused.The insecurity and fragility of the primary villains also begins to surface in the final third of the film; after Juror #8 argues that Juror #3 would take pleasure in executing the accused boy himself, Juror #3's reply of, ""For this kid, you bet I would,"" reeks of resentment, the kind that Juror #3 cannot stand to have revealed in front of others as he unsuccessfully attempts to strike Juror #8, who calmly replies to Juror #3's threat of death with, ""You don't really mean you'll kill me, do you?"" Such a reply further lowers the credibility of Juror #3 in the eyes of the other jurors, an outcome highlighted by the camera shot of all the jurors gathering around Juror #8 and staring at Juror #3 in disapproval of his inability to control himself.Shortly after this, Juror #10 experiences his downfall after he explodes into a racist tirade about the allegedly inherent incapability of members of the boy's ethnic group to care about, ""human life,"" or to obey the law; the other jurors respond by staying silent and refusing to listen to and validate his words, which leaves him feebly repeating the phrase, ""Listen to me,"" to Juror #4, who responds by ordering him to sit down and be quiet. All Juror #10 is able to do is let his beliefs crumble under the weight of the deafening silence of condemnation provided by the other jurors, as the embodiment of the kind of right-wing ethnic collectivism against which the United States of America fought during WW2 fades into a state of powerlessness and irrelevancy.After Juror #4 is swayed by Juror #8 and Juror #9's questioning of the credibility of the female witness who claimed to have seen the murder herself, Juror #3 is left alone in the jury room as the only man who still argues that the boy is guilty. He begins to fly into a rage in response to this, claiming that all the evidence has been, ""twisted and turned,"" only to be met - just as Juror #10 was - with both silence and stares of judgement from the other jurors, made all the more intimidating by the closeups of the jurors' faces that create a distinct sense of claustrophobia. Juror #3's defensiveness here almost seems to be his last attempt at preventing the other jurors from staring right into his soul, and their continued silence is reminiscent of the Napoleonic notion that one should not interrupt his enemy when he is making a mistake; the power of the film's minimalist design also becomes evident here, as this silence arguably carries a greater dramatic weight in this moment than any score could have.During his final stand, Juror #3 consistently carries himself with the air of one being victimised; his conflict with Juror #8 over the soundness of the evidence presented in court represents the psychodrama that has likely played out in his mind many times before, with his rationalisations and his conscience standing as sworn enemies. If Juror #3 can successfully blame this accused boy for allegedly murdering his father, then he can continue to blame his own son for symbolically doing the same; the silence from the other jurors, however, lets him know that this will not be an option. Eventually, Juror #3 breaks down, furiously tears his photo of him and his son into pieces, and tearfully concedes.As the jurors leave the jury room and the courthouse, Juror #8 decides to show the utmost respect for his adversary by helping Juror #3 put on his jacket - being unwilling to, as the saying goes, kick a man when he's down - and it is this interaction that reveals the fourth dichotomy that is presented by this film to its audience, the dichotomy outlined by Viktor Frankl in Man's Search for Meaning between the, ""races of men in this world,"" of the, ""decent,"" men and the, ""indecent,"" men (page 108) or, if you will, the good men and the evil men.Frankl argues that no group of people, ""consists entirely,"" (page 108) of either the decent or the indecent, and thus that you can find members of these two races in every group of people, a sentiment with which Juror #3 would have disagreed prior to his time in this jury room. Juror #8 does not believe Juror #3 to be an irredeemably stubborn or immoral man, and he is willing to be as empathetic to Juror #3 as he was to the accused boy, likely believing that both are struggling to cope with the impact of forces not entirely within their control.",12 Angry Men
651,MaccyXpert,"Juror #8, the hero (Pt. 2)",9,13 March 2021,"Note - read Pt. 1 of this review before you read this part (I wrote one long essay that I had to split into two parts when posting it on IMDB).The hero of this film - Juror #8 - consistently embodies the classically American individualism and opposition to tyranny that defined the nation during the War of Independence against Britain, its WW2 efforts against the Nazis, the Cold War with the Soviets, and many more such conflicts. He does not conduct himself either dishonestly or arrogantly as he takes the necessary responsibility to ensure that justice is meted out fairly for the accused boy. Juror #8 does his civic duty, and he does not use coercion to achieve this goal; instead, he persuades the other jurors to reasonably doubt their belief in the boy's guilt, and both he and the other jurors let Juror #3 and Juror #10 instigate their own downfalls.The anonymity of these jurors - we only know their numbers (except when Juror #8 and Juror #9 reveal their names to each other outside the courthouse) - also implies that their characteristics are not only specific to them, and thus that a Juror #3 or a Juror #10 - in other words, a parochial man who cares more about validating his own bias, prejudice and resentment than facing the truth, however uncomfortable it may be - can be found anywhere; Juror #8's responsibilities are also not only his responsibilities, but they are those of anybody who encounters these kinds of barriers to the carriage of justice.Archetypally speaking, Juror #8 ventures into the underworld by daring to confront the hostile and almost violent sides of Juror #10 and Juror #3 and by managing to leave this underworld as a better man, one who has meaningfully put his principles of fairness and scepticism into practice. Juror #3 and Juror #10 both undergo a journey through their own version of the underworld, one characterised by a realisation of the flawed nature of their previous beliefs, beliefs which they come to abandon by the time of the film's conclusion.",12 Angry Men

660,jayanthanr,My favorite!,10,10 December 2013,"My friend, Tejas, recommended the movie '12 Angry men' to me. Frankly, till then I had never heard about such a movie. He then said that it is an old B&W movie made in late 1950′s. But the reason I really got interested in this recommendation was because, he mentioned that the whole movie was shot in a single room – in a single setting.The movie takes off brilliantly from the start. The characters and their personalities are gradually disclosed to the viewer as and when required. The cast of actors have done their part remarkably well, though at times it seems that Henry Fond does steal his moments (Henry Fonda was also the co-producer of the movie). Apart from the unique situation, that of a jury in a criminal case with a split verdict, in which the movie is set, it is also the dialogues (or the arguments of the case) that keeps us hooked to the screen. There is no moment where there is a distraction or a chance for the viewer to yawn. The brilliant pace, the heated debates, the moments of short surprises keeps us interested till the very end. It's a masterpiece and I would recommend this as a 'MUST WATCH'!I am keeping this review short without even giving the synopsis of the film, so as to let you enjoy the film.Happy Viewing .",12 Angry Men

I've only seen this movie twice and they were both for a school project. I had to read the book and watch the movie, I was assigned jurors, although I got the ones who don't talk very much. It was pretty fun to do it twice. I do love to watch TruTV, I learned a lot what it takes to convict somebody, especially in a murder case. It be nice if there was a job to be a juror full time, instead of asking random people to do it, and they don't even get paid that much either to be a juror.

664,simon-harris20,Supposing we get it wrong ?,8,20 October 2012,"The plot of this film unfolds entirely in a claustrophobic and uncomfortably hot jury room. The twelve angry men of the title are jurors and must decide the fate of a young man accused of killing his father. It does not help his case that he is poor and Hispanic, and not even the tone of voice of the Judge in the case seems to hold out any hope when giving instructions to the jury about their forthcoming deliberations. The evidence to convict, and thus send the man to the electric chair is overwhelming, and the first vote taken by the jurors is 11:1 to convict. Then Juror No 8 (Fonda) starts dissecting the evidence piece by piece in an almost forensic analysis of the facts. Is everything as it seems ? Of course not. The whole film is built around the concept of reasonable doubt and whether our individual prejudices will allow us to see it. The film offers no safe answer, as even the juror who was completely dispassionate about the whole affair turns out to be mistaken. A tour de force performance by Fonda as the Liberal everyman we all wish we could be, but with excellent performances all round, particularly from E G Marshall as the composed and evidence-led Juror No 4, and a scene stealer from Lee J Cobb as Juror No 3. This film is an object lesson in film making. The tension, which ratchets up nicely throughout the film as each successive vote is taken, is created entirely by the friction between the twelve protagonists. We are presented with a cross section of American society in the sixties, and undoubtedly we will agree with some of their perspectives and disagree with others, although in fairness to Lumet the unsympathetic characters are not difficult to spot and there are some powerful moments as their true characters are revealed. There is a valid question raised in the middle of the movie by Fonda's character: there is a man's life at stake: shouldn't they take some time to talk about it ? After all, supposing they get it wrong ? I think that whether you come away from this movie as a champion of the jury system will depend on whether you believe that your peers are indeed ""twelve good men and true"" as the one point this movie does make is that while the jury system is all we have, it is far from foolproof, an can easily be derailed by ignorance and prejudice. In this case, however it doesn't and this leads me to suggest an interesting aside. I believe that if this film was made again for a modern audience, and here I am also discounting the 1997 remake, so let's say a 2012+ audience, the director might wish to provide an ending where the Fonda character does not win through in the end, and the petty arguments and prejudices of the majority of the jury are too powerful to be overturned. However, for it's time and place, this is an almost perfect film, filled with excellent performances, and a Hollywood morality tale ending where goodness and common sense win through in the end. No wonder Fonda allows himself a Mona Lisa smile as he walks away from the Court House at the end of the movie. Brilliant.",12 Angry Men

Combine together with some cherry sauce and a nice strawberry float to wash it down, you have the perfectly combined meal for tea, even if it's only a simple meal. This is the best way to describe Sidney Lumet's 12 Angry Men. It's simple. Only three minutes of the movie was shot outside the sixteen by twenty-four 'jury room'. We expect the landscapes and the magnificent out-of-life sets and camera landscapes to grasp our awe. 12 Angry Men only has a small, dusty jury room to pull an audience. Believe me, it succeeds memorably.The story starts as we see an 18 year old teenager is accused of murder in the first degree. Twelve jurors are assigned to handle this case. Clearly, as we see no one cares about the case, except for juror #8. His actions and thoughts that spring alive in that room is what makes this offering a fruitful and simple lesson about a man and the decisions he has to make right.Lumet creates a ensemble cast out of thin air. 12 Angry Men is awesomely simple, touching, most of all funny.

671,breezyweasel,Decent copy of the last half of Kurosawa's Ikiru.,8,18 May 2004,"I really enjoyed this film, but watching Akira Kurosawa's Ikiru, one of the best films I've ever seen, kind of ruined it for me.  Basically, the entire film seems to be borrowed material.  In the second half of Ikiru, a group of individuals argue back and forth about the intentions of a character who passes away.  In 12 Angry Men, the jury argues about the guilt in a case. It's not the same situation, but it's basically the same type of storytelling.  The problem is that the second half of Ikiru is so much better than 12 Angry Men, I was kind of left wondering what is so great about 12 Angry Men in the first place.  I'd recommend seeing 12 Angry Men first if you haven't seen Ikiru, because it simply can't compare to Kurosawa's masterpiece.  Good, but it is unquestionably outclassed by Ikiru.I'd give 12 Angry Men about a 7.5 to 8/10, but I'd recommend you also see the far better Ikiru, easily a high 10/10.",12 Angry Men

The characters acting out the tensions of class and race that would soon explode in the streets in the late 50s and 60's, in a tiny jurors room. The passion and the rage feels like it is leaping off the screen, while the 12 men are trapped in the room until each demon is confronted.12 Angry Men is a movie about humanity, all bottled up, ready to explode.

676,withloveandviol,They have twelve scraps of paper... Twelve chances to kill!,9,25 August 2016,"The premise for this film is fairly straightforward. Twelve men are elected to sit on a jury of a murder trial for a young boy who is accused of killing his father. Almost the entire film is centred in one room, where the men, if they unanimously vote that the young boy is guilty then he is sentenced to death. Initially, the vote is guilty, 11-1 Reasonable doubt is called into question and the men must discuss their reasons for their votes.I particularly liked this film as the situation is something that is very believable. One of the first reasons that the men give is 'he just looked guilty' due to the boy being from the slum areas, another is a man has his own personal reasons for his vote. I've always had a personal belief that jury duty is an odd premise. It seems strange that a number of complete strangers are able to determine the fate of another human without their own personal background being known. For example, someone gets accused of domestic abuse. Several of the jurors are unfortunate enough to have also had a history of domestic abuse in their life, either on the giving or receiving end - their judgement is going to be clouded by their own experiences and they are not going to be impartial to the accused. I suppose the issue is, what is the alternative then to strangers on a jury in these cases? It also doesn't seem right that one judge should be responsible for making this decision.The acting in this film isn't the best I've ever seen. Some of the characters over emphasise their lines and their character portrayal, but the 'main' juror, Henry Fonda, is wonderful. His character is deep, sympathetic and a real interest to watch on the screen. This is the first film I've ever seen with him in it, but it hopefully won't be the last as I go delving for more. Lee J. Cobb is another one of the main characters, and plays a very different part to Henry Fonda. His character is unlikeable, loud, brash and rude - and you're meant to hate him, and you truly do! The ending is slightly predictable, but you're not sure how they're going to get there which continues to make the movie enjoyable.",12 Angry Men

The jurors gathered up in the Jury Room and oh boy, was it amazing. The whole movie was shot in that room and it is near impossible finding such good storytelling.

This isn't one of the movies. 12 Angry Men is about 12 angry men that sit in a court room discussing whether or not a boy should be considered guilty or not guilty. Simple right? Well, this boy is being accused of murdering his own father and is also going to be given the death sentence. Seriously, what's not to love about this film? I really loved how it doesn't show you the court case which saves time and most importantly, gives you a neutral view of the case. This also makes what the dialogue a lot more interesting. The more they discuss the case, the more you learn about it. This is even more genius because you don't even know if the evidence they are discussing is factual. I also loved how distinct all the men were. Especially for a black and white film, it could've been very difficult to tell who's who but by not giving them names and instead giving them each their own personality. The guy with the high pitched voice, the guy who gets mad all the time, it's easy to know who's talking and what their stance is on this case.

694,Philippe277,Absolutely touching,10,20 May 2011,"There are very few movies that challenge the very essence of humanity, but Twelve Angry Men is among them, likely at the forefront. Just a bit of inquiry by Juror #8 (Henry Fonda) is enough to turn all of convention onto its head, and what ensues is a manifesto of the human thought process. First he is treated as the village idiot -- ""There's always one....."", then through common reasoning and questioning he gains some momentum among the jury until he has eventually won the vote of all eleven of his peers.The characters in that room represent a microcosm of greater society: you've got the righteous yet somewhat humble speaker of truth, the socially cold yet honorable logical thinker, the wise old man, the baseball-loving hedonist, the jaded self-proclaimed sadist, the cynical old man, the earnest hard-working foreigner, and the unimposing supposed leader (the foreman) who is among the quieter individuals who form the background audience to the great debate that carries the story. This portrayal of society makes Twelve Angry Men suitable for all viewers, and it may as well be mandatory for all people to watch this movie as its adventurous trek through morality has been and forever will be relevant to human relations.Twelve Angry Men is a longstanding testament to the spirit of originality and inquiry -- questioning the judgment of another rather than weakly conforming to it. This theme is again and again visited within the dialogue of the movie, as juror #8 is bashed by a couple of his fellow jurors for trusting his gut, or forming unconfirmed yet sensible hypotheses. But it's this pioneering spirit which achieves basically all the great feats that we reach -- it's how the judicial system and greater democracy was set into place in this country, for example. The gradual conversion of each juror from a ""guilty"" vote to a ""not guilty"" vote shows you the potential for the realization of truth that lies in each man in this world, as well as their varying methods of reaching it. For some it was reached by plain logic (juror #4), for others it was through direct empathy. Some men leapt aboard the bandwagon only once it had gained some might, and some only came over after having held onto their original view until the bitter end.....having been blinded from common sense by their own distorted emotions (juror #3). Regardless, every juror lands somewhere on the spectrum and is entitled to their own unique view, just as ordinary people are in society.There are almost too many unforgettable moments/lines in Twelve Angry Men to count all of them.....from the hullabaloo that ensues when the jury first learns of the lone ""not guilty"" vote at the beginning, to the re-enactment of the old man limping down his hallway, to the convincing of juror #4 through the ""glasses"" ordeal, to the final stand and glare of the eleven jurors at juror #3. There's the final exchange of the movie, when jurors #8 and #9 exchange names and ""meet"" for the first time (telling you something about how dehumanizing and tense things got in that small room). Oh and speaking of that small jurors' room -- virtually the entire movie takes place in there! On paper that idea seems somewhat ludicrous for a movie, but the compelling nature of the plot somehow made me forget how physically stationary the story is. Cinematographer Boris Kaufman used a brilliant tactic over the duration of the film: he lowered the cameras as the plot continued. At the start we're able to appreciate the size of the long room, and we look down upon the jurors, but by the end each man looms over our view, large than life, as we see him speak, and the walls appear to have closed in on us to create a very cramped and tense atmosphere. Very well done.Ultimately, this is one of my favorite films, touching the soul of humanity and leading its audience through an entire range of emotions, and all while in a very commonplace setting. Sometimes the simplest premise makes for the most enthralling story, and through superb acting, a terrific screenplay, and innovative cinematography, Twelve Angry Men accomplishes this and lays claim to being one of the greatest films ever made.",12 Angry Men

699,everyones-a-critic,If you only ever watch one court drama - make it this one,10,24 March 2004,"A staggeringly good film, Twelve Angry Men pits Henry Fonda against the rest of his Jurymen in an attempt to prove a young accused murderer's innocence.First it's a great story. Its hard to go wrong when you have a great story to start with handed to you by a writer, or in this case a playwright (many have managed to do just this though). Lumet does an excellent job with the excellent tools he had to work with. He captures the claustrophobia and sweatiness of the piece perfectly, and uses cinematic tools like cuts and zooms only when appropriate. Otherwise he lets the actors do their thing. And it is  the acting which raises this one to the next level.Fonda is good here but in reality he is like the control subject in an experiment. It is the quality of all the other actors in the piece which really makes this one stand out. Every single one of them portrays a character with perfection. When you have a film set entirely in a few rooms - essentially a play adapted with camerawork, then you need to have good acting. And boy do we get it. This is a film with eleven best supporting actors and no extras. While none of the eleven might be considered a ""star"" in their own right perhaps, the proximity of the piece leads them to act off each other and give the performances of their lives.There have been films with a lot of talented actors in them sharing a billing before and since, however, there has never been a film with such an ensemble of excellent acting on display at once in my opinion.",12 Angry Men
700,imim123,A Hot Debate over the Jury System,10,12 October 2015,"Listening to people talking for an hour and a half in only one scene, it is strange that I don't feel bored at all. Every single line is logically composed with its special meaning. What strikes me most is what one of the jury said, it almost summarize the whole film:""We have a responsibility. This, I have always thought, is a remarkable thing about democracy. That we are... What is the word? Notified. That we are notified by mail to come down to this place to decide on the guilt or innocence of a man we... we have never heard. We have nothing to gain or lose by... by our verdict. This is one of the reasons why we are strong. We should not make it a... personal thing."" This film also reveals that sometimes we don't treasure our right. At the start of the film, almost everyone is impatient and wants to get out of the room as soon as possible. But we should not forget that it is our right but also responsibility at the same time, and our decisions directly have influence on the fate of another man. The film also repeatedly reminds us that, as a jury, another point to bear in mind is that a man is not guilty until proved. The presumption of innocence is the basic principle of modern legal system of criminal procedure.But sometimes because of prejudice, we always jump to the conclusion before we see the evidence. Just like one of the jury said:""Some of the time... I tell you. It's always difficult to keep personal prejudice out of a thing like this. Wherever you run into it, prejudice always obscures the truth.""It's been a wonderful time for me while watching the film. Thanks the cast for their amazing performance. Each of 12 jury represent one type of people and the audience can find their own reflection in them. For these who plan to watch it, I can assure you that you won't be disappointed, and I will recommend this film to everyone.",12 Angry Men

704,Andrew Devonshire,"No bombs, no car chases but edge of the seat stuff none the less",10,18 September 2002,"This film is superb, in fact as Shakespeare once said ""Its the bees' knees"". The film captivates the audience from the beginning.  Each of the twelve jurors are introduced to us as they are introduced to themselves. The characters are well draw out and individual, each with his own personality.The tension of the characters draws the audience in from the start.  We imagine that the case is open and shut, 11 me saying guilty and 1 not.  We feel the discomfort of Henry Fonda as the other characters belittle and mock how he can see any reasonable doubt in the case.  But we also share his victories and the enthusiasm as he proceeds to refute or add doubt to the arguments for guilty and are captivated and draw in as other jurors begin to see doubt in the proceedings.The audience can also see the arguments for guilty and wonder if Fonda's character is correct in saying that he doubts. Yet they also feel the shame of the characters as he disproves that a previously sound theory is iron tight, joining his side as members of the jury do.On top of this they are wonderfully woven in human elements such as the misconceptions that influence people and the growing tension between different characters.  This is brought to life even more by the amazing performances, Fonda, Lee J Cobb and Joseph Sweeney are of particular note.I started watching this film on a bored relaxed laying about day but by the end i was on the edge of the seat with my hands on my knees feeling more tense than a politician on results day.How a film should be made.

715,Thelightbulb,"If you only ever see one Black and White movie, make this it.",10,22 September 2005,"I watched this film for the first time, when it was shown at about 1 o'clock in the morning. I made an effort to see it as it is rated as one of the best movies ever made, however I must admit that I watched it with a sense of reluctance as I'm not a great one for old ""classics"". This film blew me away however; how ignorant can I be about old films? How many other pre-1960s gems are there out there that I haven't seen? What strikes me most about this film is how progressive it is for its day. Indeed the issues this film makes about American society of the 1950s, still ring true for western society today. This film concerns twelve jurors debating the sentence of an 18 year old Puerto Rican boy who on the face of it, has no real alibi. However one man, played brilliantly by Henry Fonda, is ill-at ease putting a young boy to death without even debating his case, much to the despair of the other jurors. What follows is a brilliant piece of film making, slowly revealing many of the juror's complex characters to the audience as they react to Fonda's concerns with their own mix of metal scars, prejudices and insecurities. What especially struck me about this film is how ordinary most of the characters are, none of the jurors are shown to be especially bad men, indeed most are portrayed as honest everyman type people. The use of ordinary characters is the films master-stroke because as one by one they begin to question their initial instincts, the flaws of society that have let this Puerto Rican boy down are presented to the audience. Tragically it appears that many of the issues that were beginning to be discussed in the 1950s have only got worse. For me there is one immortal comment in this film: one of the jurors, a man in his 50s says that the youths of today have no respect and have changed so much for the worse since his day. How ironic is it that some grumpy old men of today who may not even of have been born when this films was made, still say exactly the same thing? Finally a quick look at the cast shows that Fonda aside many of the cast were only moderately successful after this film. I think that's a shame as everyone of these actors is excellent and plays their part in making it one of the best films of all time. However within the cast there are a couple of treats; look out for Jack Klugman (Quincy) and John Fieldler who is the voice of many of Disney's characters such as Piglet.

From that point, each man tries to separate the prejudice from the actual evidence and make up his own mind about the boy's guilt or innocence. For such a simple story, the film is tremendously intense and clever, and it will most likely keep you on the edge. The acting is absolutely flawless; the twelve men of the jury represent a wide spectrum of personalities, from the tempered and reasonable guy to the funny and naive one. Henry Fonda takes the cake and gives what must be one of the best performances of his life, but every other actor is equally brilliant. The whole story is developed in just one scenario and it often has clever and funny moments, becoming more and more tense as the film progresses. This film honestly blew me away.

717,brittondv,Mortality coupled with relativity!,8,10 October 2011,"First of all let me name it as classic. No other word will be sufficient I believe. Mortal is life so is life related things i guess. The mortal man is so preoccupied with the very concept of mortality and it overflows into everything he does: his words, opinion, character and the list goes on. It also reinstates the hard truth that everything and anything can be coloured so easily at our will. And, one other thing is that man is mere puppets in the influence of his prejudiced mindsets. He doesn't even try to think instead just act on the spur of the moment.Yet another aspect is, what's actually truth and is there truth indeed? Everything turns out to be mere the fabrication of words and vulnerable to errors I believe. Mortality is coupled with relativity, a perfect companion for the mortal man to have on his side. Well, watching films is really educative. For, I've studied one other lesson too. Among the 12 Angry Men, most of them are really angry at themselves, being in this hellish status of life and may be the way they are compelled to live on. If its so, how can they value others life on which they are casting their vote. Love, correct, value ourselves first then to the other.. Isn't it the right path?",12 Angry Men

720,clouds88,Amazingly Brilliant,9,20 December 2014,"There are very few movies that make you go speechless, remain awestruck due to their sheer concept and execution. This is one such movie.12 men, each from a different background, different views and opinions, strangers to one another, come together, along with their personal prejudices, to reach a decision acceptable to all. This line itself shows the magnitude of complexity involved, and to make a movie out of it is a work of true genius and a one that leaves you spellbound.Right from the first shot, till the final one, you are so engrossed that you would even forget to breathe. If the background sound track, screenplay, script, direction are the cake, then the roles enacted by the characters (I say characters here, not the actors, because you believe they are truly the 12 angry men) are the icing on top of the cake.Surprisingly it was only after the movie, did I realize that it was a black and white movie. The movie shows that to make a good movie, you don't need exotic locations or high drama, or superstars. All you need is a good story and good actors who make you forget they are merely playing their parts in the play.The movie teaches you how an analytical mind and logical thinking can make a difference of life and death. It teaches you to be the most responsible when you have a person's life at stake. It shows how our personal prejudices and upbringing can affect our reasoning, how our senses play with our sense of judgment, how we let our emotions take over, at a time when it is required to be fair and impartial, how we tend to be a part of the crowd because we scared to be the odd – man-out. How one man, one true, sensible and empathetic man, it takes to make a difference. How important it is to have an objective and open mind, at any point of decision-making - in life/ death matters. How we are so stuck upon the facts and what we see, that we forget to use our mind, the ultimate powerful tool that we have. And that all it takes is sense and reason to convince someone, not decibels.There are movies that make you laugh, or cry. There are movies that make you wonder and then there are movies that make you think, force you to ponder upon it, understand it, and learn from it (if possible).

I only know Lumet by his new films and I think this is the first film I've seen Henry Fonda act in. This is why I could watch this movie unbiased and without prejudice.12 Angry Men is one of those rare movies that would not benefit from modern cinematography or acting. It is perfect as it is. Obviously the movie is this great because of its screenplay but all the technical aspects of it were at least on par with it so I had a really hard time guessing what decade the film was made. In my opinion what determines a movie's timelessness is its rewatchability and the ability to attract new viewers from new generations. 12 Angry Men definitely has both of these characteristics.,12 Angry Men

Eleven out of twelve think the defendant is guilty of murdering his father and one of them thinks, ""Element of Doubt"" still remains. The movie is about the character study of all the twelve people in that room trying to sift through all the evidence. The twelve men jury represent a cornucopia of Americans: the bigots, the prejudiced, the cool and calculated, the timid and the self-aggrandizing gloaters. It shows how some people get carried away by some outward appearances. At the end of the movie, we do not know if the defendant is actually guilty or not. We just know that there exists an element of doubt in the evidence provided. It shows how a careful evaluation reveals there could be something beyond what is obvious. As an academic researcher, I have been taught that most of the times, the most obvious solution could be wrong and this movie bears testimony to this fact.

725,poweller,Brilliant In It's Simplicity,9,20 September 2010,"Forty three years since the release of Sidney Lumet's debut, in a current cinematic age where films seem increasingly judged on the strength of their special effects or CGI, how refreshing it is that 12 Angry Men can still be considered a masterpiece.On the face of it selling the premise of 12 Angry Men is no easy feat. The film focuses on the jury in the case of a young man facing the death penalty for the murder of his father. However, what's different is that 12 Angry Men is set almost entirely within a single, unremarkable room, as the twelve jurors try to reach a unanimous verdict.Featuring such cinematic greats as Joseph Walden, Lee J. Cobb and the superb Henry Fonda the film relies purely on an excellent screenplay, fantastic dialogue and consistently excellent character development as the various prejudices of the twelve jurors are revealed. Because of unspectacular setting there is a fantastic feeling of claustrophobic suspense that dominates throughout Beginning with 11 jurors convinced the man is guilty, only Henry Fonda's character expresses any doubts. As the film plays out various ballots are taken where the characters give their verdict and increasingly Fonda's character places doubt in your mind that the other juror's opinions are clouded. In the history of film there are very few directors who could capture the suspense that Lumet generates from such a shabby, sparse setting, for instance each time the men take a ballot and it is revealed more and more of the jury have their doubts.Compared to the stunt filled, special effects marathons that seem to dominate our screens today, 12 Angry Men still stands out as a ray of light that proves beyond doubt that excellent dialogue, screenplay and acting talent wins out on CGI any day.",12 Angry Men

735,rsimard,Superb examination of human dynamics (R.l.P. Sidney Lumet),10,9 April 2011,"Director Sidney Lumet has passed on. May he rest in peace.Twelve Angry Men exhausts one in the search for superlatives. All but a few minutes at the beginning are set in a single, nondescript jury room, consisting of, essentially, the table and twelve chairs, a closet for hanging coats and hats, a water cooler, a fan that only works for half of the movie, restrooms and windows overlooking a generic view of a city which happens to be New York but which could as well be any other metropolis. Within this sparse environment, director Lumet crafts a riveting drama from Reginald Rose's original story.Twelve Angry Men does employ some major elements of dramatic license, and some criticize it for them. A few are: juror #8's walk through the defendant's neighborhood and purchase of a switchblade knife constitute jury research, a no-no, not to mention the implausibility of a juror getting away with bringing one into a jury room. The test of the time for a witness to walk a certain distance is a jury experiment, also disallowed. Either would be grounds for a mistrial.I do not consider these flaws. First, this is not like a modern courtroom drama, trying to realistically dramatize our system of justice. It is a drama about people, their passions and prejudices and the tension that rises high when twelve people are faced with the need to find unanimous agreement on a subject as emotionally charged as murder, with so much at stake, forced to subjugate their freedom to think, feel and speak independently and unchallenged under pressure from eleven others trying to do the same in that search for universal agreement. Jury deliberation is the vehicle for creating this environment. Some limited bending the reality in ways that are implausible only because of the rules of the real world is no crime.A movie trying to be faithful to the process of jury deliberation would consist almost entirely of people sitting around a table talking. It's hard to imagine making a decent drama out of that. Dramatic license, when properly chosen and limited, is no detriment.The characters and the superbly cast performers characterizing them are wonderfully diverse and defined, from hesitant and mild-mannered to brash and arrogant, stiff and cerebral to low and bigoted, idealistic and forthright to weak and manipulable, simple and quiet to vengeful and enraged. There is a distinct dynamic to every combination and interaction, and the human condition and spirit are uniquely explored in each of them. Each is a drama in itself and at the same time one piece of a whole seamlessly joined with all of the others.This movie also contradicts the cynical view that society is hopeless. Despite the differences of intelligence, personality, integrity, values and ethics among these people, ultimately a basic desire to do the right thing surfaces in each one.A black-and-white cinematic masterpiece, this film is not for those numbed by dazzling effects and wall-to-wall ""action."" For those moved by a brilliant view into the core of what it means to be human, this will ring true for a long time.",12 Angry Men
736,dseliber,One of the greatest pictures ever made,10,30 July 2002,"Looking at the lists from over the years of the American Film Institute (best movies, comedies, thrillers, and passions), I've come to the conclusion that they know what they're talking about. However, they did make one mistake: the failure to recognize '12 angry men' as one of the best motion pictures ever made. Quite simply, '12 angry men' is perfect, or very close. It's the story of a court case, in which an 18-year old Hispanic kid is accused of killing his father. What's very interesting is that, with the exception of the first two minutes and the last 30 seconds, the entire movie takes place in the jury room. The twelve jurors are discussing the case, and the bottom line is that every single solitary shred of evidence points to the direction that the kid is guilty. At the preliminary vote, eleven of the men vote guilty, and the twelfth man (played by Henry Fonda) votes not guilty. And then the fun starts. The film progresses with the eleven men convincing Henry Fonda that the boy is guilty (""they proved it a dozen different ways in court. Would you like me to list them for you?""), and meanwhile, Henry Fonda tries to convince them that there is enough reasonable doubt to consider that maybe the boy didn't commit the murder after all. There are several things that make this movie so good, and perhaps the most impressive is the fact that the acting performances are perfect; all twelve of them; a feat almost unthinkable in today's cinema. Each of the twelve men have a different personality, and you'll remember every one of them. The one that really stands out is Lee J. Cobb, because his character is very complex. He starts off polite and pleasant, and as the film progresses, starts to become 'excitable', as one of the characters calls it, and seems to suddenly be personally involved in the case. ""12 Angry Men"" is riveting, exciting, fascinating, and one of the greatest motion pictures of all time. A must-see.",12 Angry Men
737,wjkelly-2,Great legal drama that takes place in a jury room!!,10,17 March 2008,"Eleven jurors in a murder trial feel an 18 year-old is GUILTY for killing his father and should receive the death penalty. Henry Fonda's character is the LONE JUROR, who feels that the boy is innocent. The brilliance of this movie is how close to ""real life"" it is - full of adult material, which was unusual in those days. How many of us, who have served on jury duty, have faced these types of people? I know that I have. The room is HUMID and HOT and you know that it is going to be even MORE HOTTER during the ninety minutes of deliberation. Fonda is wonderful in how he is capable of presenting the ""what if"" arguments and his own investigative speculation into the case, which is also a drawback to the film in that such speculation is not permissible under current legal proceedings. None of these jurors know each other and they come from different backgrounds - one is an architect (Fonda), while another is a calm, observant older man (Joseph Sweeney). These two are capable of dissecting the facts of this case better than their fellow jurors. The other ten jurors are either unconcerned, unwilling, inpatient, bored, selfish, prejudiced, or sadistic, or they simply don't care. Each character brings with them different backgrounds and education. Obviously, those who are better educated, or older and wiser, (Fonda and Sweeney), tend to be more careful and analytical in their decisions than the sadistic businessman (Lee J. Cobb), the prejudiced garage owner (Ed Begley), or the selfish salesman (Jack Warden) - the WORST types of jurors that one could ask for in a legal case. The football coach, (Juror # 1 - Martin Balsam), who is the overseer of the jury proceedings, is likable, but would prefer to be elsewhere. They are anxious to come to a conclusion and be on their merry way, especially Warden, who has to be at the ball game on time.The shy, uncertain bank clerk (John Fiedler) is willing to go with the flow of the others. The advertising agent (Robert Webber) is the same way. These are also poor qualities for a member of the jury. The confident broker (E.G. Marshall) is certain the boy is guilty based on the facts of the case. His argument would be more relevant in a true legal proceeding. The self-conscious common man (Jack Klugman), the dependable painter (Edward Binns), and the careful, East European watchmaker (George Voskovec) are more willing to compromise with Fonda. How will it play out? It depends on those jurors who are uncooperative and uncontrollable, especially the sadistic Cobb. ""Kids these days.""Score: 10/10",12 Angry Men

Every moment of this film is connected with the whole story , it has no waste in it like the majority of films . It is one movie that i can watch over and over , just to see how the characters are evolving through the presentation of questioning the facts that the trial is based on .Even from the start that almost everybody , did not hesitate to send an other human , a kid , to his death , the movie concludes that none of them is a bad man, every character is with good intentions and lust for justice .

739,john-zeigler,12 Angry Men Great Drama,10,2 December 2008,"A beautifully told story. It all takes place inside a single room  and yet so much happens that it is never dull and never slow. The intensity is constantly tight, and it gets tighter and tighter as the film progresses, leading it toward its climatic ending that reveals so much about humanity and how we become stunted by our prejudices. Lumet, who is of course one of our brilliant filmmakers, is great in that he never let's the drama (which often is very intense) or the acting go overboard. Furthermore, the film is very unpretentious. This frank approach to the material is exactly what makes it so believable.

745,asajb2000,NOTHING beats this original,10,10 June 2007,"Why make another version of this movie? I just finished watching the 1957 version and I admit it seems like a play (and probably was developed originally as a play since it basically takes place in one room) and it was also broadcast live during the heyday of the golden years of television. We'll never see the talent of the actors in the room who have since passed-away. In fact, only Jack Klugman (at age 85) is still with us. Other movies seem tailor-made for plays, such as Glengarry Glen Ross. I'm not sure if the casting was simply dead-on or the actors happened to nail the roles they had or a combination, but each person seems very well-suited to his role and it's hard not to get wrapped up in the dialogue and the general pace of the movie (as though you were peering into the jury room through a peephole). In fact, as I watched each actor, I identified with people I knew who had the same characteristics, such as Jack Warden's wise-ass, or Ed Begley, Sr.'s angry racist or Lee J. Cobb's uptight, high-strung yelling man or any of the other people. I do think that Jack Klugman's role may have been miscast. I didn't necessarily identify with him as a product of the slums. They could have cast a minority for his role but I guess in 1957 all-white, male juries were what was the norm.",12 Angry Men
746,ErikPedersen1,A Masterpiece,10,13 June 2019,"12 Angry Men is a masterpiece. I don't think it would be an exaggeration to say it's as close a film can get to being flawless.The premise is simple: twelve men on a jury have to decide whether a young man is guilty of committing a murder or not. The film is all-dialogue and virtually the entire runtime takes place in a single room.
What makes the film truly special is how its individual aspects fit together so well.The writing is immediately gripping and does not waste a single moment of screentime - every piece of dialogue in the film has a purpose to serve in the tightly-woven story. Things that are alluded to or spoken about previously are brought up again in later dialogue. Not only does this help build the characters, but it also plays an important role in the story when a character contradicts their own argument or proves another's point unintentionally, for example.Adding to this, all of the characters are unique and distinct from one another. You quickly get a sense of each character's personality and who they are through their dialogue, appearance, body language, and how they speak. This is made all the more vital due to the fact that the audience is not even told the names of the jurors - we end up knowing them purely by their personalities. Needless to say, the acting required to pull this off is incredibly impressive.Also, I love the camerawork in this. Many parts of the film are comprised of long takes where the camera is panning around the room or from character to character. Other times, the camera will cut to a close-up of a character's face or slowly zoom in. It works incredibly well in the telling of the story and accentuates the brilliant acting.I honestly do not have a single complaint about this film. It is immensely impressive in every way and I find it thoroughly interesting every time I watch it. As far as I'm concerned, it is an essential viewing and I can not recommend it highly enough.",12 Angry Men
747,pmassey-23533,The Best Film I Have Ever Seen..probably,10,1 September 2017,"This film features the trial of a young man accused of murdering his father. All of the action takes place in one room - the jury room.So much going on in this film. It is about evidence, closed-mindedness vs open-mindedness, gender (no women on the jury as women were not invented til 1984), lots of stuff. But mostly it is about class.Henry Fonda is brilliant here. He is an architect, so it is reasonable to suppose that he is middle class, intelligent and open-minded. He votes not guilty, not because he believes the accused to be innocent, but because he's just not sure. He's on his own.Gradually over the course of the film, he attempts to convert all of the other jurors...There are jurors that are ignorant, jurors that are stupid. Jurors that are both. Jurors that just want to go home, not caring really about the guilt or innocence of the accused. All are challenged with Fonda's expert Socratic prodding..Superb acting by everyone.Interestingly, this is all achieved with on a budget of $3.43. I mean it all happens in one room, there are no explosions, and no car chases.

This film is paced beautifully. Taking place in real time; it's never boring and constantly a moving plot that gets more tense and more tense by the minute. Entirely revolving around a single, long conversation, the film makes the audience feel the same amount of suspense and tension as a movie full of action.Each character is very different, with different levels of persuasion and logic. And most of these characters have linking backstories that directly influence the actions that take place in the script. Credit is also heavily due to the real and powerful acting, especially from Lee J. Cobb.

753,dragicakosir,Masterpiece by all standards,10,10 April 2019,"The prerequisite for a death sentence is an unanimous decision of the jurors: guilty/ not guilty. Here, we see an extraordinary proof of the fact how much stronger the good is than the evil. The actors play their roles very well indeed. The (verbal) struggle lasts an hour and a half - of each individual against himself or against all others.
In the beginnig there is only one man advocating reasonable doubt. And that one as a broom sweeps away the compulsive ""opinions"" of his - at first, antagonistic - co-speakers. He doesn't encroach upon anybody else's truth, nor does he try to manipulate them, and yet... He smoothly leads the other members of the jury to a path of consideration and reflection, where they come to new findings by themselves.
I experience the end of the film as a phenomenal display of a redemption/atonement, of restoring a peace with oneself - moment when a man becomes aware of his own dark side, finally accepting it.
The two diametrally opposed roles are symbolically presented as if they were father and son, who finally surmount all distances in order to come nearer to one another in the end.
Out of the unexplored depths a hatred towards the ones who think differently evaporates, spreading to this group of people and to people outside this room, very much the same as the steam evaporates from the depths of thermal springs.
Who is better, who is good and who is bad? The questions and answers that arise in the Winnetou-movies or in the competitive games also in the modern time. ""He is such..."". We hear one of the jurors when he tries to manipulate the first ""dissident"". ""They're all the same"", he answers. Why didn't he say ""We are""? Well, some of us already know the answer to that, too. Others are surely going to get to it sometime.
In short, a film I can only heartily recommend to watch, especially for those who love and cherish creative doubt.",12 Angry Men

755,vukodlak,Excellent,10,1 July 2000,"An excellent courtroom drama with a unique twist. Instead of following the trial itself, the viewer has a unique chance to observe the events behind the closed doors of a jury room. The film begins with the end of the trial. The jurors retire to deliberate the case. A preliminary vote is taken and the result is 11:1 in favour of the guilty verdict. Eleven jurors have raised their hands to convict a young man of killing his father. Only Juror #8 has doubts. At first even he does not truly believe the young man to be innocent but notes (rightfully) that the case for the defence might have been presented in a more convincing manner and that the boy might be given the benefit of a doubt. Since the boy is to be executed if found guilty his life is now in the hands of the jury and juror #8 reasons that the least they could do is talk about the case a bit. As time goes on some of the jurors change their minds and find that there is perhaps enough reasonable doubt not to convict the young man after all. But not everyone is easy to convince.Although the plot of the film is excellent and it is fascinating to see what little things can influence which way a verdict goes, where this film really succeeds is in presenting the characters of the 12 jurors. The character of each of the jurors emerges through a wonderful mix of perfect casting, excellent dialogue and near-flawless acting.Juror #1 - a simple man who clearly does not understand the full complexity of the task that lies before him but is trying to do everything not to let anyone else find this out. He appears at ease only once during the film - when he talks about football. He has the misfortune to be selected foreman of the jury - a task he clearly does not relish.Juror #2 - a small, quite man, clearly unaccustomed to giving his own opinion much less to expecting his views to be of any importance. Apparently he finds solace in his job - he is an accountant.Juror #3 - probably the most complex personality in the film. Starts off like a pleasant self-made successful businessman, he analyses the case impartially, explains his arguments well and is reasonably self assured. As time goes on he becomes more and more passionate and seems to be somehow personally involved with the case.  He also starts to show some signs of slight mental instability. Wonderfully played by Lee J. Cobb - this is the character you remember after the film is over.Juror #4 - self assured, slightly arrogant stockbroker. Obviously considers himself more intelligent than anyone else in the room, he approaches the case with cool heartless logic but (as one of the jurors says - ""this is not an exact science"") he does not take into account the feelings, the passions, the characters of the people involved in the case. He is conspicuous by the fact that he is the only juror that does not take his jacket off (it is a very hot day).Juror #5 - here is a man under great emotional stress. He comes from the same social background as the accused boy - with who he almost unwillingly seems to identify with. Paradoxically this appears one of the main reasons for him voting guilty - he does not want compassion to influence him - so ironically it does.Juror #6 - a simple man, quite readily admitting that everyone in the room is better qualified than he is to make decisions and offer explanations. But he really wants to see justice done and it worries him that he might make a mistake.Juror #7 - the only one that really has no opinion on this case. Literally throughout the film his thoughts are never on the case - he talks of baseball, of the heat, of fixing the fan but the only reason he has for voting this way or that is to speed things up a bit so he might be out of the jury room as soon as possible. Not an evil man he just has no sense of morality whatsoever - he can tell right from wrong but does not seem to think it's worth the bother.Juror #8- a caring man, has put more thought into the case than any of the other jurors. He tries to do his best even in the face of seemingly impossible odds.Juror #9 - a wise old man with his great life experience has quite a unique way of looking at the case.Juror #10 - the most horrifying character in the film. Votes guilty and does not even try to hide the fact that he does so only because of the boy's social background. The tragedy comes from the fact that his own social position is only a cut above the boy's - which makes him all the more eager to accentuate the difference.Juror #11 - an immigrant watchmaker, careful methodical man, well mannered and soft spoken. respects the right of people to have different opinion to his - and is willing to look at both sides of the problem. Loses his temper only once - horrified by the complete indifference of juror #7.Juror #12 - a young business type - perhaps he has his own opinions - but is careful to hide them. What he has learnt out of life seems to be that intelligence is equal with agreeing with what the majority of people think.The film succeeds in doing something very rare today - developing an intelligent plot while also developing 12 believable, memorable and distinct characters.",12 Angry Men

But fortunately, I am here to talk about it.12 Angry Men came out in 1957, it was made by Sydney Lumet and stars Henry Fonda, to name only one of the fantastic actors that made this movie so real. 99% of the action takes place in the Jury room. 12 Jurors are debating on a murder trial. A men, played by Henry Fonda, will try to convince his fellow juror of the innocence of the boy accused in this trial.12 Angry Men is such a smart movie and evoke so many different themes through this one trial. It mainly shows how powerful is one man's speech. All of the beliefs about the case, the ones that seemed so obvious to the 11 other men, are refuting one after the other by the character of Henry Fonda, leading to heavy doubts in the jurors mind. The life of a boy depends on how will this man try to convince 11 others, of what he truly believes is the truth or at least the not certainty of it.Through the movie, you feel the pain, the claustrophobia of being in this room, you just feel like you are the 13th member of the Jury.All in all, of course it's an old movie, it's in black & white but please, don't pass on this movie, it has a strong message, and is the typical type of movie, precise, smart, deep, relevant..., that are strongly missing these days.",12 Angry Men

When I watch a movie I'm trying to understand everything, Particularly when it's about a movie with no action whatsoever. The thing about 12 angry men is that you can watch it even after 100 years and it still a depiction of human nature, of how we can understand each other, of how we can discuss a fact, of how we can understand each other, Of how we can trust each other and of course how we can come to a conclusion regarding another person's life.I'm not very much schooled about the art of acting, but I'm just talking like a profane, Who has witnessed a magnificent performance from all 12 actors involved in this picture. It's just outstanding! I've always thought that in old movies, actors are over exaggerating and that they are very dramatic in a sense that sometimes it's on the verge of ridiculous, But the thing is that in this movie I felt that I saw 12 different man Took from the streets and asked to be themselves and come to a conclusion.

The moment the court attendant locks the doors, you can feel the tension of twelve individuals merging under the surface. The film isn't about spending vast sums of money on creating a blockbuster, nor does it feel the need to explain every last detail about each of the characters portrayed. Perhaps these key differences are exactly the reasons ""12 Angry Men"" strikes one as so effortlessly brilliant.One of only two shots outside of the room is at the beginning, with the exasperated judge calling for the adjourned verdict from the jury. You have a closing shot of the young boy on trial before the twelve men assemble themselves into the sticky, humid room to consider their decision.The movie doesn't take a long time to get started. Questions are raised instantly and answers are given. Juror #8 (played by Henry Fonda) instead glares in a moments reflection onto the street below as the other eleven men give their first impressions willingly. It is clear from the conversation that the majority who have spoken are convinced of the boy's guilt, with many of them keen to come to a final verdict as soon as possible.Instead, upon the first vote, Juror #8 goes against the grain of everyone else and decides to pitch his verdict of not guilty to the astonishment of his fellow jurors.What happens next is 80 minutes of passion, pain, conflict, and conclusion.What I find remarkable about the character of Henry Fonda is although he is not convinced of the boy's guilt, he is also equally not sure about his innocence. As he poses questions and figures out answers, it is clear that he is realising these facts at the same time as everyone else. In the depths of his mind, he has ideas surrounding why the boy might be innocent but needs to formulate them, and he is able to do that via the other jurors, even the ones that put up a fight. As he finds more reasons to doubt a guilty verdict, his reflection allows the other eleven men to do the same.With each revelation, and the testimonies brought into question, you can feel the passion of twelve individual opinions. Whilst some of the jurors were not so outspoken, they still played a part in peeling apart the layers of badly constructed trial. Whether it was a personal experience (such as living by the El Track, or wearing glasses) or just an view of one man, they all fitted together in a jigsaw that eventually, couldn't be disputed. As the film reached the climax, so did the heat, finally erupting into a violent storm that reflected the tension in the verdict room. In particular, it was parallel with the clash between Juror #3 (played fantastically by Lee J. Cobb) and Juror #8 (Henry Fonda) - 8 being the stand alone verdict of Not Guilty to begin with, and by the end, 3 being alone in his verdict of Guilty, before breaking down.The film was beautifully directed, shots of the intense weather, the cigarette smoke drifting away and the passion of the twelve men in deciding their verdict reflected in their perspiration collaborated effortlessly with the script. There was no need to delve any deeper into the characters, build exaggerated story lines or become unnecessarily violent. All it needed was twelve men, with different backgrounds, to explain themselves.",12 Angry Men
770,chrisq28,Great Movie,9,15 March 2005,"Ostensibly, 12 Angry Men is a chamber piece about twelve motley jurors who are stuck with deciding the guilt or innocence of an eighteen-year-old kid who is charged with the murder of his father. It's actually more than just that, though. It's an examination into the unknowability of the truth, and a character film that cross-examines the lives of men from all walks of life.When the film begins, the men take a preliminary vote. The results show that there are eleven men who think he is very obviously guilty, and only one man (Peter Fonda) who thinks that there is a reasonable doubt of his guilt. Of course, most of the other men think he's crazy for even suggesting innocence--half of them are already out the door and ready to send the boy to the chair.""How do you know?"" Fonda is consistently asked.His response is the same every time. ""I don't know anything, I'm just saying we should ask some questions, that's all."" The story unfolds magnificently and cleverly, a smorgasbord of personalities clashing and interacting with each other--all within the confines of a stiflingly hot sixteen by twenty-four foot jury room.The performances in this film are amazing. Each juror comes across as a man who has his own reasons for deciding the guilt or innocence of the alleged murderer, and the method with which each man ultimately decides are all unique to his person.12 Angry Men comes across as a bit of a tribute to the American justice system as well. Careful not to claim perfection for it, director Sidney Lumet simply portrays it as the best system we have available.""What if you convince us all and we set a murderer free?"" one of the jurors asks Fonda. Fonda doesn't answer.A friend noted that she felt that the motivations for some of the juror's final conclusions came on a little strong, most notably in the case of the biggest advocate of the accused's guilt, who is played by Lee J. Cobb. Cobb seems to have some inner demons with his son, who he reveals he hasn't spoken to in years, and it's clear that at least several of the jurors begin to suspect Cobb's feelings aren't due to the facts but are the result of personal issues towards youth as a whole. I disagree with my friend. When critiquing a film, it's certainly important to gauge your feelings on the subtleties brought forth by it--in this particular scenario though, I feel that the complaint is a reach. I never found the scenarios that were brought forth by any of the characters was too heavy-handed or polemic. Quite the opposite--I viewed the story as the simple unfolding of a murder case that was to be decided by twelve very different individuals, each with his own background and story to contribute.12 Angry Men is a straight-forward and fascinating story that is well-directed, well-acted, and makes a valuable point. I can easily add this to the list of my favorite films.",12 Angry Men

The story and pacing however defined the genre for generations, and made the film a classic.The film has its flaws, and they are easily identifiable.

This simple plot however brings out emotions and bias from each of the twelve juries. This is backed by stellar performances, especially from Henry Fonda and Lee.J.Cobb who the film centres around. Lee.J.Cobb plays the most complex of the Juries, and his slow descent into his true feelings toward the case are both compelling and believable. There are some Juries that don't really get that do not get that much screen time, but the film makes sure to make them have a key role somewhere. Some may dislike that there is only one location, but I think this allows the film to stay focused and not stray onto another side story, in this way it is very similar to rear window, in that you never see anything that happens from anyone Else's perspective apart from James Stewart perspective. This style helps to keep 12 angry men flowing. Overall this is one of the finest films ever created and has not aged one bit.",12 Angry Men

It would have to be someone the father knew intimately as he was in the house! This person would also need to be exactly the same height as the defendant.It's beyond reasonable doubt that it was the kid who killed his own father. There is no other rational explanation...and so the film praised universally for being about prejudice in the judicial system is ultimately, really, about something else entirely.",12 Angry Men
776,obro,Simple. Genius. Immortal.,10,29 May 2015,"This film provides audiences with a white knuckle thrill ride that they can't turn away from. But there are no car chases and punch ups, in fact the entire movie takes place in one room, and the narrative simply follows a discussion between 12 angry men. So how could it be so enthralling to watch?Well, unsurprisingly, it's really the dialogue. The writing in this film is genius. Every time I watch this movie I am gripped by every word, even when I already know what is about to be said. It is some of the most provocative dialogue ever put to film. I literally get goosebumps at certain parts of this film because it is so intelligent and it gives you pleasure as a viewer that you can just relish in the brilliant and thought provoking debate that is being presented to you. The fact that the film seems like an adrenaline ride is a real testament to the screenplay that Reginald Rose created. As I said earlier this movie takes place in one room, the audience is given one environment and it never changes. The writing is so clever and so thought through that despite the never changing surroundings of the room the audiences never loses focus, never loses interest. It is simply delicious writing.The performances are of course fantastic as well. Each of the 12 men have their own personalities and their own personal thoughts on the case at hand. Each actor really captures their character to the extent that the audience can start to put together a picture of what kind of man each of the men really is, despite the fact that we never even learn such basic information as their names. Henry Fonda however does stand out as being especially powerful as Juror #8. I'd like to just quickly say that Juror #8 is probably the most underrated movie hero of all time. Fonda brings a degree of charm to his role which makes him extremely likable for audiences and so you find yourself strongly rooting for him, just another element that takes the audience deeper into the world of the film.Frankly this is one of the best films I have ever seen. It is such a simple concept and because of that it was possible for all of the aspects of this film to be executed to very a high standard. This is one of those films that everyone has to watch at some point in their lives, and despite the fact that it was made in 1957 I promise it won't seem dated when you watch it if that's something you might be cautious of going into this movie. The fact that it was made such a long time ago shows it stands the test of time. Simple. Genius. Immortal.",12 Angry Men

778,Rick96,Excellent movie that still holds up 60 years later,9,8 November 2019,"12 Angry Men is essentially a wordy film that epitomizes civic duty. Director Sidney Lumet does a phenomenal job at taking a script with 12 average looking men that hardly ever leave one room and creating a startlingly moving picture. The movie is shot entirely in black and white, which in my opinion, plays a positive role in highlighting the amazing dialogue.Henry Fonda leads a troupe of men serving their jury duty down a truly thought provoking rabbit-hole that ultimately tries to determine if the young man on trial is guilty ""beyond a reasonable doubt"". The intense dialogue in the movie brings to light an often forgotten subject that is just as prevalent in real life as in the movie - the art of arguing.My only knock on the movie is the slight far-fetched detective skills of Fonda himself. His Sherlock Holmes' like nose for detail is the only way to make the movie work but I must say that he points out/recalls some flat out miraculous details hours after a brief hearing.The bottom line is that despite this movie's age, it still provides a relevant perspective of the American jury system - and many of its flaws.",12 Angry Men

Also I thought it a stretch that Henry Fonda's character could be so persuasive simply by standing his ground and saying 'maybe he's guilty and maybe he isn't.'Perhaps its high IMDb rating is because a lot of people agree with the moral message it preaches. Maybe the moral message is 10 star but the movie is not. If you want to see a really good, classic, one scene, character study movie, check out Hitchcock's ""Lifeboat"".",12 Angry Men

The film, mostly carried by brilliant acting and intensely realistic screenwriting, portrays the immense pressure, complication, and difficulty a jury faces even for cases that might openly seem easily soluble.
The film manages, especially in its earlier acts, to uphold the moral dilemma entirely from the point of view of the jury. We are never shown whether the boy is guilty or not - and thus are left with the same perspective as the jury has. It is, despite the jury's final verdict, still quite possible that the boy in question did, in fact, murder his father. However, 12 Angry Men slowly and gradually allows the viewer to gain the understanding of the approach taken to cases such as these.
While pretty much the entire film stays consistently excellent, the ending, and the conclusion overall, isn't as airtight as the rest of the film is. Despite this, 12 Angry Men is still quite a stunning masterpiece, and has hardly gotten worse over the years.",12 Angry Men

It is a movie that never becomes stale or dated. It was one of the few movies that I actually bought on VHS. Although I have seen only (or mainly) the B&W version, I think that color would detract from the starkness of the scene, the seriousness of the role these men play in the life of one young man. The ensemble play of these very differing characters is remarkable, and there are many moments that are unforgettable: E.G. Marshall taking off his glasses and massaging the bridge of his nose, thus unwittingly raising another point of doubt; Lee J.Cobb vehemently condemning young punks and at last breaking down over his own failure as a father; the old immigrant who brings a totally different perspective to justice. The slow character revelation is outstandingly written and directed and had the movie not had the blockbuster action picture ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" to contend with, it should have won numerous awards. Although there is virtually no real action in the movie, the tension is unrelenting as the jurors try to decide whether there is reasonable doubt. A film to savor again and again.

798,nandue0929,12 Angry Men: Improper behavior of a juror,5,21 February 2011,"12 Angry Men is the utmost in entertainment as a character study, but only that, not as jury reality. It is fascinating due to the magnificent actors who portrayed the jurors. The viewer becomes increasingly engrossed in the dialog by their superb acting, which transcends the drab setting of the jury deliberating room. However, as a lawyer myself, the movie contains an instance of jury impropriety, which ruins the film from a legal standpoint.During jury deliberations, one of the jurors brought in an item identical to one that was introduced at the trial and showed it to the other jurors. This is a classic case of improper jury behavior! Jurors may only consider the facts, witnesses, and evidence presented at trial and what may or may not be inferred from them; not outside items that were introduced in the deliberating room, such as this ""second"" item. Reasonable doubt in a criminal case must exist itself, not be deliberately manufactured by a juror. Additionally, the movie takes a considerable ""stretch of the imagination"" to conclude that not one of the other jurors reported this behavior to the judge at the time it happened. The juror who mentioned that it was against the law was ignored.Despite the excellent acting, 12 Angry Men is disturbing even if it is ""only a movie"" because the legal content is pure fiction. The movie gives a distortion about permissible jury conduct and would never have ended the way it did. If the case had been real, there would have been either a mistrial or this juror would have been dismissed and replaced with an alternate juror who heard the trial and the deliberations started over again. Also, the juror would probably have received a stern rebuke from the judge when he was dismissed, mistrial or not. This juror (the late Henry Fonda) was not some kind of ""hero"" as the viewer is led to believe, indeed, he was quite the contrary. 12 Angry Men is not a movie for someone who may be called for jury duty for the first time, despite how it may seem to those untrained in the legal system. I have read that this is the only movie Mr. Fonda ever produced (as well as acted) and, perhaps, he let his personal feelings of justice interfere with reality.",12 Angry Men
799,narnia4,Who would have thought 12 men sitting at a table could be so exciting?,10,22 March 2012,"12 Angry Men is a film that wasn't hailed as revolutionary at the time. In fact, it didn't make AFI's first ""100 films"" list and was only ranked #87 after the revision. It wasn't even a box office success when it was released. Despite all that, its with good reason that this film is ranked so highly on IMDb's top 250 list.12 Angry Men is one of the few films ever made that is excellent in every regard, in some regards it feels almost flawless. The acting is top-notch from every actor involved, with Lee J. Cobb in particular standing out with one of the best performances I've seen in a film (in particular his speech near the end). The directing is wonderful, the plot is interesting, and the pacing throughout is spectacular. This is one of those films that is very hard to dislike, in my experience even younger audiences with lower attention spans or those who dislike black and white films have, with very few exceptions, really enjoyed this film.One aspect that I want to single out is the editing and pacing, which stands out as some of the best I've ever experienced. All but a very few scenes take place in the jury room, and yet the film is ""edge of your seat"" material throughout. More than that, every single time I watch it I feel as the jurors feel. It starts out slow, like there's nothing to deliberate. When the jurors begins speaking a little more seriously, a little more angrily, you can feel your heart beating faster. Then the tension builds even more and just when I feel like I can't handle any more, the jurors take a break and walk around the room and cool off and wipe sweat off their brows just as I do while watching. The pacing is absolutely perfect, the fact that so many films are filled with gratuitous sex and constant violence and yet fail to enthrall me like this film, it speaks volumes as far as the quality and greatness of the film in all areas.The most criticized element of the film is the ending (which I won't spoil) and really the entire process that is begun by Juror #8 (Henry Fonda), which is kind of out of bounds as far as how a jury is supposed to work. In real life, yes, what happened in the jury room, would probably have been enough for the whole situation to have led to a mistrial. But this criticism really misses the point of what is something of a ""message movie"", although not in an obnoxious way. Its a look at the justice system, the fact that a life is being put in the hands of twelve individuals with their own stories and, necessarily, their own biases. And indeed, a human life is worth enough to at least ""talk about"". The film takes a good hard look at the legal system, and its worthwhile and personally has led to many good discussions with others who have seen the film.12 Angry Men isn't a film that was the first of its kinds, its ideas aren't necessarily unique. Its excellence in every category and the tremendous direction and pacing (and Lee J. Cobb) is enough to make this a favorite of mine and a film that will be enjoyed by almost anyone who watches it.",12 Angry Men

Marshall is another of my favourite support actors - finishing his career in big time movies with an excellent cameo in 'Absolute Power' - the only David Baldacci book to successfully translate to big screen, thanks to Marshall and the excellent Gene Hackman. None of the reviewers mention much about Ed Begley - not the greatest of actors but good in this and also in 'Million Dollar Brain' playing a megalomaniac with KKK overtones.",12 Angry Men
803,Skino473,More than just cinema,10,31 January 2016,"I kind of feel like i'm in no position to judge this film, because that is what a review is after all, judgment. The reason i feel unworthy of reviewing this picture is because it is one of the best films ever made and i can not say that about too many films. This film is a study on the nature of man and all of what he thinks. It's a study on why we take action about pretty much anything. Beneath all the convincing and lecturing, the main character shows more than that: the psychology of the masses, the prejudice and it's roots, the mixed feelings of thinking that you're doing good even when not sure if you are and so many more. I don't really want to get in to the story of the film, not only because the film offers a quick and grabbing pull into it's universe, but also for not wanting to ruin the experience of meeting the cosmos that Sidney Lumet orchestrated for the audience. This is one picture that deserves it's place in the books of cinema history and in my opinion, a great 1957 masterpiece.",12 Angry Men

It may be the best movie I've seen in my life. The actors work beautifully and the dialogs are placed in a both intriguing and, sometimes, funny way. Henry Fonda does a great job convincing the other 11 men that a boy is innocent (or at least, not surely guilty) of the murder of his father. I was amazed at how he and some other men, as they dispose of their original opinion, arrange their arguments in order to show that the boy may be innocent - and that is another beautiful thing: there is no way one can determine, from the arguments given, whether the boy is or is not guilty. That's where the viewer's imagination takes part.I only imagine how it is to be a lawyer and watch this movie. It must be one the best jury experiences one can ever witness.

I saw this version a few years later and were more thrilled by this one, as it is so extremely realistic in its way. The clue sits with the actors and the director who can make such a movie out of only a few film sets. Yes the whole movie is filmed in a single room with 12 men in it, and the tension rises for every minute, and for every minute something twists and turns.It's about 12 men who are about to vote for the chair on a man on trial. But one of them want to hear more about the case, can this man alone make all the others turn their statement from guilty to innocent ? This is one of the best movies ever made, and proves that the storyline is what make great movies. See this, and enjoy.",12 Angry Men
809,MarSco,One of the finest works in film history,10,3 May 2005,"Sometimes, unfortunately not very frequently, there are movies that are as close to perfection as possible. ""12 Angry Men"" is one of these. The basic idea is as simple as brilliant: director Sidney Lumet puts in his debut film 12 men together in one (resp. two rooms) and then during the whole film they stay in this place and discuss whether the accused boy is guilty or not, and in the same time they decide on his life. This last point is actually the critical aspect Lumet brings into this play-like movie. But no matter how simple the idea is, it is certainly not easy to realize it and to make out of this a good film. Lumet has made a fine work. It is just incredible and amazing how well he has managed to create such an intense and involving drama. One possible reason why he has succeeded so well is probably because he was supported by such an excellent cast, above all and of course, Henry Fonda, who gives here one of the best performances of his long career. But lets not forget the other actors like Martin Balsam or Jack Klugman. All in all this film is (and will always remain) one of the greatest directorial achievements in film history, with only one scene that somehow disturbs (but not very much): the very last sequence outside the building where Juror #8 (Henry Fonda) reveals his real name. In fact, he should just have been Number 8 and the whole action should only have taken place in these one or two rooms. Apart from this detail, ""12 Angry Men"" is a film you must have seen and it is even today very underrated.Rating: 97MarSco",12 Angry Men

The screenplay is one of, if not the best, ever written, and is probably the best aspect of the movie, even above the incredible acting, which I'll get to. The way characters talk in this movie, you learn so much about them, their lives, and their prejudices and why they feel the way they do about the accused. Not only that, so many startling revelations that keep you hooked throughout. It's all really smart, without being pretentious.Again, the acting is incredible. All the jurors gave the required depth to their characters, and then some. I felt like they were people in real life. Speaking of real life, you do feel like you're there, like you're also a jury, thanks, again, to the writing, but also the cinematography. It's brilliant.Also, I must mention, the pacing is perfect.

816,scottduffus,12 Angry Men's message is relevant 60 years on,8,8 February 2018,"Growing up in the 60's my first experience with courtroom drama was watching Perry Mason defending the innocent by uncovering all the hidden facts. The first courtroom movie that I remember was the classic '12 Angry Men' Made in 1957, the same year as the first series of Perry Mason, the film tells the story of a jury that has to consider the innocence or guilt of an 18-year-old boy accused of killing his father. If found guilty the boy would face a mandatory death sentence.95% of the film is shot in the one room to which the jury has retired to consider their verdict. In considering the age of the movie, the first thing you notice is that to be judged by your 'equals' in the 1950's meant to sit before 12 white males. As the jurors enter the room, their flippant remarks and labelling of the male defendant, who comes from the slums, shows a wide range of bias, bigotry and lack of concern for the outcome they are to make a judgement on. What appears to be a simple decision of all voting guilty is thrown into disarray when juror 7, Henry Fonda, goes against the grain and votes Not Guilty. So begins a journey that requires each man present to consider their own status in life and whether there may be a reasonable doubt that the boy is guilty.There is no doubt that the movie has aged but the exploration of each jurors motivation helps each character develop. The decision to only identify each man by their juror number and with no background provided the viewer is free to identify with one or more characters based on their own views of morality and ethics. The room has no cooling and as the heat of the day grows and the men become more visibly uncomfortable the claustrophobic atmosphere helps build the tension. The use of close-ups as characters make statements also gives you a sense of how small the room is as tempers fray.While the movie has aged the premise is not much different to a number of documentaries shown recently that ask people to face their own intolerances such as refugees or indigenous communities. If the defendant was not an abused boy from the New York slums but an aboriginal or Muslim youth from the western suburbs of Sydney, Melbourne or Brisbane I believe we would see 'our peers' struggle with a similar dilemma as the cast of this movie. One by one each character has to question their initial conclusion and determine whether the verdict of guilty should stand.While Henry Fonda is the star of the movie, the cast many of the respected male actors of the period with Lee J Cobb, Martin Balsam, Jack Warden, E.G Marshall and a young Jack Klugman of Quincy and The Odd Couple fame. To watch the movie now the acting is certainly over dramatic in parts but the idea of giving everyone a fair go, doing what is right when the numbers are against you and facing your own bias when judging others are still important concepts today.

825,C_J_Lister,12 Angry Men Review,8,28 March 2020,"I do love these types of movies. You have one location and a bunch of actors that have to play off one and another to sell the story and their performances. This is when you can tell whether you're a great actor or just a good actor. It helps that the script was incredibly well written too. This film captives the audience from the very beginning and doesn't let you go until it's over.The tension of the characters draws the audience in from the start. We imagine that the case is open and shut, 11 me saying guilty and 1 not. We feel the discomfort of Henry Fonda as the other characters belittle and mock how he can see any reasonable doubt in the case. But we also share his victories and the enthusiasm as he proceeds to refute or add doubt to the arguments for guilty and are captivated and draw in as other jurors begin to see doubt in the proceedings.Henry Fonda knocks it out of the park with his performance in this film. You can feel his characters discomfort as the others belittle and mock how he can believe this young man could be innocent. You feel for him. You also share in his victories as he slowly casts doubt in each of the jurors' minds. For me, Henry Fonda should have at a bare minimum been nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor, and although it would have been a tough call, he should have won it too. Because in my opinion, his performance was better than Alec Guinness performance in The Bridge on the River Kwai.I just wished they made films like this today.",12 Angry Men

829,KIFulgore,I was forced to endure this,1,6 July 2001,"I cannot believe I was forced to endure this movie in a class I took at college.  Synopsis:  12 men sit in a room and talk for the ENTIRE movie. It's about as fun as sitting in the doctor's office listening to the chit-chat of other patients.  I know it's supposed to be good since it has the noble purpose of pointing out the already obvious fact that some accused people, if the jury does not consider carefully all the evidence, will be wrongly convicted.  Also, some of the ""evidence"" presented to defend the accused is sketchy, at best.  It seems too many jurors have taken this movie to heart -- in this country we turn people like O.J. Simpson out on the street.I might have liked to read this as a book, where I could at least dream up my own characters and give them more to do besides sit and talk.  The two main characters were also pretty flat; one is your all-enlightened bleeding heart liberal who thinks a crack dealer that has been arrested 42 times will straighten up if given ""just one more shot at 'rehab'.""  The other is the typical conservative loudmouth whose values are rock-solid and self-righteous and he's going to scream louder and louder until you agree with him.

Nowadays if you were 1 against 11 you would back out immediately and follow the crowd, I am not saying that people would change their mind and go with the crowd , but they would agree and then silently go home with their heads down and feel guilty for the rest of their days, weeks( later maybe forget and drop the guilt , but some part of us will always remember how we didn't stand on our opinion. This is not a story of the boy ( the convicted man) being absolved ( there are almost no personal emotions involved in the story (regarding the defendant) , but its a story about standing for what is right and just and good. Its about democracy!! This should be a must see in law and humanity courses alike! I have no idea how the jury's in US work now , but I really hope they are just. This would be silly , but they should show this film before the real life jury starts their work. Actually this should be a crash course into professional journalism and politics as well :D , I mean the way that ""he"" makes them change their mind or digs out new information , is quite brilliant. Just the way in which he makes them realize their own falseness is so clever and fair. He doesn't convince them that they are wrong , but he makes them see where are they wrong, makes them realize that they might be wrong in what they believed to be self-evident. I have always believed that the only way of making somebody change their mind is by making them change their own minds , and in this movie it is one of the central ideas. Not to even mention the incredible performances , every single actor is perfect in his role! The script , the dialogues,the close ups. Perfect! Just something we are really lacking in modern cinemas-good dialogues ( not saying that nothing like that is produced , but nothing like that gets to the big screen).why only 9 at the end, well its not only 9 , it IS great , however for higher mark it lacked a little bit of emotion ,drama . Then however , I don't think that this particular story could have been made any better ( well I haven't watched the remakes , maybe I will), but huge part of the idea was for somebody to be truly fair , they have to get rid of attachments and personal feelings.

Believe it or not, 90 percent of the film is shot in a single room. You won't find elaborate sets, skimpily clad girls or any high octane action, but what you are going to find is the stellar performance from all the 12 angry men and a very subtle yet edge of the seat thriller.

For a start they wouldn't have anything to spend the huge budget on and where would they use the compulsory CGI.I thought I was going to like this and I was right. Despite being set in the one room for the majority of the film the tension keeps your eyes on the screen and the story keeps your mind active trying to make up your own mind as to whether or not the boy was guilty.As some others have mentioned the only problem I have is that I still felt the boy was guilty at the end of the film and that it was a bit unrealistic how some of the jurors suddenly caved in and changed their vote (especially the one who couldn't recall some detail from days ago, so that proved the boy could be telling the truth about not remembering the films he supposedly saw. Doh!) Nevertheless, I tried to suspend this feeling of annoyance at the somewhat liberal preaching attitude of the film so I could appreciate its finer points which are many.I do wonder though, whether a darker ending where we see a closing shot of the accused with a kind of smirk on his face walking out the court insinuating he was guilty after all would have satisfied me more though and given more food for thought.I score a 9 though as its as classic as they get.",12 Angry Men
840,Sebastian_Conrad,12 Angry Men: A Classic Work of Genius,9,15 May 2016,"12 Angry Men is a 1957 American drama film with elements of film noir, adapted from a teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose. Written and co-produced by Rose himself and directed by Sidney Lumet, this trial film tells the story of a jury made up of 12 men as they deliberate the guilt or acquittal of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt. In the United States, a verdict in most criminal trials by jury must be unanimous. The film is notable for its almost exclusive use of one set: with the exception of the film's opening, which begins outside on the steps of the courthouse followed by the judge's final instructions to the jury before retiring, two short scenes in an adjoining washroom, and a brief final scene on the courthouse steps, the entire film takes place in the jury room. The total time spent outside the jury room is three minutes out of the full 96 minutes of the film.12 Angry Men explores many techniques of consensus-building, and the difficulties encountered in the process, among a group of men whose range of personalities adds intensity and conflict. No names are used in the film: the jury members are identified by number until two of them exchange names at the very end, the defendant is referred to as ""the boy"", and the witnesses as ""the old man"" and ""the lady across the street"".In 2007, 12 Angry Men was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"" and is often seen as one of the greatest films ever made.",12 Angry Men
841,ennajraM,A Masterpiece ( spoilers),9,21 February 2009,"I never expected ""12 Angry men"" to be so great. A movie that takes place in one room and has no action what so ever doesn't normally spark my attention. I can't really pinpoint what it is about 12 Angry men that makes it so great, because all that this movie is is conversation between 12 men. I really got pulled into the conversation and just like the jurors the more time went by the more I went along with juror nr. 8. At the end of the movie I was even convinced that Henry's Fonda's character was right all along.However the main strength of the movie wasn't the subject of the conversation (guilty or not guilty)but the real underlying (daddy/ son)issues. Although the movie took place in one room I really got a good impression of most of the jurors. Some were more fleshed out than others, but there were a few instances that I was really impressed by the dialog and also the acting. A scene that comes to mind is the whole racist rampage that is uttered by jury nr 10 (from a very good Ed Begley)and the reaction of the other 11 men. I also really liked juror nr. 12, a man that wants to be liked so badly but hardly dares to give his two cents and changes his verdict from guilty, to not guilty, to guilty and then Not guilty again. Also the part where Juror nr 9 talks about the old man that ""witnessed"" the murder. He talked about the witness as this was an old man that wanted attention, because he was lonely and no-one ever listened to him. You could tell by the acting of Sweeny that the witness was exactly like him. Also Lee J. Cobb (Juror nr 3) has a few very impressive scenes. Especially the last one in which he breaks down comes to mind.I know that everybody talks about Fonda and although I think that he is a really good actor, I thought that the ones that really shown in this movie were Cobb and Begley. However everybody was good and at the end of this movie I was really glad I watched this masterpiece. There I said it. Not a word that I use easily when talking about movies. But according to me 12 Angry men is one of the best movie's of all time, a brilliant character study.",12 Angry Men

It is a study in the legal concept of ""reasonable doubt."" The judge in his final instructions to the jury speaks of it, and one of the jurors asks another whether he understands the concept of reasonable doubt. The presence of a number of reasonable doubts heightens the pathos of a young man's life hanging in the balance of justice.

Just a discussion for 90 minutes to be excited till the last second in the movie.This movie has the absolute meaning of critical thinking, and how critical thinking can change many axiomatic issues which we don't give them the enough thinking and then judge on them the wrong judgement.Henry Fonda was wonderful in his way which he tries to convince the others and refuses to follow his intuition and just went to the critical thinking in somebodies life or death matter",12 Angry Men

The most wonderfully beautiful images are on screen during this movie. For me, the issues for this movie come from the script. Some of the dialog isn't too great or well delivered. The acting is only OK. I really look for acting in these older movies because I sometimes feel that it holds movies back. The acting in 12 Angry Men does not hold the movie back, but it could be better. On a whole, this is a wonderfully artistic and moving movie.

I don't understand the appeal of this movie at all. All it is revolves around twelve angry men yelling at each other for the entire movie, in one room. Sure, it tells the story (and I'm seriously stretching the term for this particular live action reel) of a jury made up of 12 men as they deliberate the guilt or acquittal of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt, forcing the jurors to question their morals and values. This works well as a play and I like the acting and dialogue in this, but does not translate well onto movie at all. That's what Parliament Question Time TV show is there for. This movie is so boring, forgettable and torturous that this is the third time I literally fell asleep a half hour in besides Transformers: Age of Extinction and the new version of Independence Day. Because movies are meant to entertain people, even Tommy Wisseau's The Room and the animated Titanic movies are watchable compared to this torture device. This movie is generally studied in English (lucky I never had to do that, even though there was no way I could escape seeing this movie), and I feel for the high school students who have to watch this for study, and fans of this movie who would throw their money at everything they see.",12 Angry Men

Henry Fonda gives his finest performance here when he must timidly vote against conviction then lead the group through strength of character to set aside their presumption of guilt and grant the defendant a shadow of a doubt.

The camerawork is perfect, getting progressively closer to individuals as the story unfolds. The script is paced to perfection.  The plot is convincing.  However, it's all a little too contrived; obviously this has to be the case.  The film can only support one scene for so long, and we have to reach the opposite conclusion within that time.  Still, you have to wonder exactly how poor the defence attorney must have been to miss all these important doubts on the prosecution case.  Maybe that's the point - all over the democratic world, people are getting screwed over by disinterested attorneys because there is no juror #8 in every jury.  I prefer to think that this is, of course, symbolic, or even didactic.  A reminder to everyone of the meaning of 'reasonable doubt' and 'guilty', and a lesson in how juries should reach verdicts.

This 60 year old film brings up still relevant issues; classism, toxic masculinity, prejudice against immigrants, etc. It leaves us confronted with our tendency to choose violence and judgment over mercy and empathy.

878,markgraham280,So good it belongs in a time capsule,10,28 September 2012,"A man has been brutally murdered and now the life of his eighteen-year-old son, the prime suspect for his killing, is in the hands of twelve jurors. At first glance, it's an open-and-shut case: two witnesses supposedly saw and heard him do it; he had a clear motive; and he even owned an identical knife to the murder weapon. Yet, while eleven jurors are completely convinced of his guilt - some because of the sheer weight of evidence and others due to their own personal prejudices - one man (Henry Fonda) is not. He does not necessarily believe the defendant to be innocent; he simply isn't sure of his guilt. Alone, ridiculed and under intense pressure to conform, he must persuade his fellow jurors one by one that all is not as it seems.The scene is set for a fascinating cinematic study of the human condition and, arguably, the most gripping film ever made.I meant to review 12 Angry Men for my university paper two years ago, but never got around to it. Now, having recently completed my first stint of jury service, I believe the time couldn't be more apt for me to right this small injustice. For Sidney Lumet's directorial debut, with its perfect acting, intriguing plot and technical mastery, symbolises for me all that is good about Hollywood cinema, but which we rarely get to see.Based on Reginald Rose's teleplay of the same name, 12 Angry Men takes place almost entirely within a drab and claustrophobic deliberation room. There are no set changes and little in the way of action; only gorgeous, clinical dialogue. In a genuine feat for 1957, however, Lumet's camera glides effortlessly around this room, making it appear far bigger than it truly is; indeed making it seem as if you yourself are walking around it, like the jurors tasked with deciding a man's fate.For the classicists reading this, the film adheres to the unities of time, space and action, with film-time closely mirroring audience-time, a detail that yet again transports us against our will inside that room. Lumet also presents a Moby-Dick-esque 'self-enclosed universe', in that each juryman represents a specific human trait: anger, meekness, indifference, compassion - the best of humanity and the worst. It is a film replete with close-ups of human faces, as if the director is constantly trying to see what lies behind them.What at first appears to be a simple story of revenge is gradually and ingeniously deconstructed by Fonda's character until the audience doesn't quite know what to believe by the end. Every time we think we've reached the bottom of the mystery before us, new depths reveal themselves, until all we're left with is multiple pictures of the truth taken from confusing angles, rather than a single definitive image.Fonda is imperious as the white-suited knight of justice, fighting bigotry (the defendant's ethnicity is left ambiguous) and ignorance at every turn on his quest to discover the truth. What might entertain you even more than his rhetoric, however, is the detailed characterisation on show throughout - twelve men who are utterly believable and who all have their own unique motivations for voting ""guilty"" or ""not guilty"".Aside from Fonda, notable performances come from Lee J. Cobb (The Exorcist), who plays the antagonistic Juror #3, and Joseph Sweeney, an actor whose IMDb profile page doesn't even include a photograph, but who is sublime as the elderly yet highly observant Juror #8. Perhaps the biggest compliment I can pay to this film is to say that there isn't a single average performance in it. Good as the actors are, however, they are helped massively by Rose's acidic script, memorable monologues, and one-liners that are so incisive they'll leave you stunned to silence.On that note, I can't think of a film that has as many genuinely surprising moments as 12 Angry Men.12 Angry Men is not devoid of humour - indeed it contains several amusing characters who provide much comic relief - but it is first and foremost an intellectual, psychological and, dare I say it, philosophical film that has been teaching us about ourselves for over 50 years now. It really belongs in a time capsule; it certainly deserves a place in your movie collection.",12 Angry Men
879,Im_Stuff,A movie that everyone must watch at least once,10,4 October 2021,"Putting my review as spoilers because I always enjoy talking about plot elements. So take it as more of a possibility rather than a certainty.12 Angry Men is a show that can't possibly be copied. In a time where every debate seems to be emotionally charged, this movie older than my father is a good reminder to always keep one's head cold and look at every angle.The setup, while very basic, some may even say dull introduce a very unique way to create tension in a story. By offering all of the information about the crime and the victim through the words of our jury, the movie makes a great effort to avoid making us sympathize with any side of the problem and have us, the viewer, look at the discussion with an objective look, which I believe is a very powerful idea.To add more to it, the cast is very diverse in thought, and our main character, who in this case is juror number 8 isn't the most clever man in the room, or the most experienced, hell, he isn't even hard stuck on his position and has conceded his point several time throughout the movie's run time, which both kept the conflict meaningful and made it feel like a back and forth instead of ""protagonist faces a problem, after recruiting friends and getting stronger, eventually the problem is gone"".Plus, the cast doesn't have 2 people who have the same mindset, you will have the hot heads, the ones who doubt, the ones who don't really care, the ones who are emotionally involved, the ones who prefer to look at the problem from a factual angle and so on.And even the few times where something seemed far-fetched, it was never something that could be entirely ruled out, but more like something that would happen, albeit very rarely.One last thing, that was very powerful to me is how after this trial, nothing really changed, in this day and age, movies love continuity, gotta make you spit the sequel money. But not here, in 12 angry men, the cast started as strangers, and ended as strangers, as shown in the last scene of the movie where juror n°8 and n°9 asked each other's name before leaving on a handshake. Everything that happened in this movie wasn't meaningful, or rather, everything that happened wasn't part of a greater narrative. The movie could have ended in 3 minutes and the outcome would have barely changed. And that to me, is not only unique, but also refreshing in a rather odd way.",12 Angry Men
880,theperplexedprodigy,A Perennial Classic,9,16 October 2021,"12 Angry Men (1957)
Dir. Sidney Lumet""Facts may be colored by the personalities of the people who present them.""
Reginald RoseCourtroom dramas seldom grace our screens. But when they do, they make sure to leave a fierce impact on our minds.To be blunt, there haven't been many of this kind in the post-classic era; at least not as good as Sidney Lumet's first-class '12 Angry Men' of 1957. With Henry Fonda as the lead, the film exudes quality and confers a piece of art way, way ahead of its time. Be it the writing, act, or screenplay, Reginald Rose endowed us with an inch-perfect monumental classic.The story puts the center stage on the verdict of the jury comprising of 12 members having contrasting perspectives on the accusation faced by an 18-year-old boy with the charges being the murder of his father in cold blood. How it pans out throughout its short runtime of 95 minutes at the same time forcing your undivided attention is a remarkable achievement.With the story not pleading for any external brilliance apart from the characterization of Henry Fonda, the compellingly rousing script illustrated that it's plentiful for a movie to be cited as a masterpiece. The renditions of the actors are so shrewd that the notion that it's been made in 1957 blows our senses out of proportions.'12 Angry Men' is just the kind of film that has the right to demand your token of appreciation for its unsophisticated making, brilliant acting. Indeed an elegant work, frame by frame, act by act.",12 Angry Men
881,Ateg,An American Masterpiece,8,4 February 2010,"This is a true undeniable American masterpiece. Courtroom dramas rarely match Sidney Lumet's film. The story is about 12 jurors on a murder trial that turns out to be much more complicated than first thought, all thanks to the persistence of Juror 8 played wonderfully by Henry Fonda. This is an hour and a half of gripping, engrossing drama. Prejudice, society classes are just some of the themes that run through the movie from start to finish. These characters are so well written that by the end of this movie you will feel as you must have encountered them at some point in your life. This realness makes 12 Angry Men even the more powerful and thought-provoking.When this film came out in 1957, Sidney Lumet main input was limited to TV shows and series. Working on 12 Angry Men was not that much different, Sidney Lumet did not use any sophisticated material or expensive locations, he relies here on the power of the screenplay and dialogue and the strength of an all star cast headed by the great Henry Fonda. Limitations that only add to the sheer power of 12 Angry Men.12 Angry Men is a must-see masterpiece, it is one of the best films of its time and genre, it will capture your attention and make you sit down and think long after you finish watching, it also rewards multiple viewing. Now if those qualities don't make a good movie, I don't know what does.",12 Angry Men

I'm excited...,10,11 September 2009,"we are doing this play in my high school for our fall play, but instead of Twelve Angry Men, it will be Twelve Angry Jurors, so that women can have parts. I think that this will be a really awesome play. i have seen the movie and loved it, and i have also read the actual script of the play. It is excellent and on a very high level for high school though our school always does AMAZING but challenging musicals and plays. am i the only one who thinks that we'll do a good job..? last year we did The House of Blue Leaves, a very challenging yet wonderful play, and the year before we did You Have the Right to Remain Dead. In the current play this year, i will be playing juror #8. i auditioned for this part. i think this is ONE of the best black and white movies i've seen, and i'm 14 years old!",12 Angry Men
884,Thaati,Extra Ordinary finishing touch,9,15 July 2010,"What Can I say? I never thought I would be much interested in a Black and white movie like this one. Started to watch with an ordinary feel. But finished watching with a very high satisfaction. The way they avoided to tell us whether the boy is really guilty or not makes us feel like a thirteenth juror over there. That thing attracted me the most in the movie. And all through the movie, I suspected that Juror 3 could have actually made the murder as he was strongly stressing that the boy is guilty. But when Fonda, in climax, takes the coat of Juror 3 and helps him wear it changed my view. It made me feel that Juror 8 actually respects the view of Juror 3 who just fought hard for what he believed to be true.Extra ordinary Climax. * Respecting Juror 3 left the movie without any villain in the movie * Leaving to our own decision whether the boy actually did the crime or not though they let him go because of the benefit of doubt.These two things will never go out from my mind whenever I think about this movie.",12 Angry Men
885,absiddique1,An all time classic,10,14 September 2013,"This trial film tells the story of a jury made up of 12 men as they deliberate the guilt or acquittal of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt. This directorial masterpiece by Sydney Lumet is a must watch for all of you. Though the entire movie takes place in a single jury room (with a broken ceiling fan of course) but has got an intoxicating screenplay where several twists and turns awaits you.There's a scene where it starts raining all of a sudden, a scene which brings a fantastic change to the story where you, as an audience, feel like taking a break from the hassle and enjoy rain.Overall, this movie is a must watch and is highly recommended.

The whole movie took place in a single room and the characters just kept on talking! If someone invites you to such a movie the first thing that will come to your mind would be ""Boring""! Well its not even close to that.The movie is extremely entertaining and uplifting. The story is very well written and keeps you tight to your chair to the end.I read some reviews about the movie criticizing the absence of female characters also having all the jury as white men, I trust that would be understood taking in consideration it was made back in 1957.To me it is a MUST see and deserves it rank in IMDb.",12 Angry Men
887,sheenawhite,just comments..some spoilers,6,24 March 2003,"Aside from being extremely predictable, this was a pretty good film.  A murder has taken place and a young boy's life is on trial.  The film focuses on the twelve men that make up the jury.  In the beginning, they are fairly certain that the boy is guilty of the crime.  In fact, eleven of the twelve men believe he is guilty.  One man, for no particular reason except for a hunch, feels that the boy is innocent.  This, of course, causes a lot of turmoil amongst the other men.  They must stay cooped up in that hot, cramped little room until they can all agree on the same verdict. The lone man slowly begins to question the facts.  Pieces of the puzzle begin to fall into place and one by one, the other men begin to see the light.  They too start to believe that the boy is innocent of the crime.  In the end, all of the men end up changing their minds and an innocent boy's life is spared all because one man put a little more thought into the details.  From the very beginning of the film, it is quite evident that all the men will change their minds in the end.  The interesting thing is seeing what it is that actually convinces them to change their minds. The fact that almost the entire film was shot in the same room was quite effective.  It allowed the viewer to feel as though they were actually a jury member taking part in the trial.  The viewer never really gets to see all the details of the murder.  When the members of the jury try to envision how long it would take an old man to hobble down a hallway, or what a person with poor eyesight would see through the windows of a moving city train, the viewer must try just as hard to envision such things as well.Throughout the film, the director used a technique where he kept changing the depth of field.  Although subtle, it was also very effective in creating an ever increasing sense of discomfort and aggravation.  All in all, this film was very well written and I quite enjoyed it.  (Although I must add that the reason why the last man changed his mind was a little too emotional and hokey for my liking, by hey, whatever works!)",12 Angry Men
888,rob-quirk,true cinema classic,9,25 March 2003,"Even though this film was made in 1957, the issues it raises are still relevant to us today. Racism is still a widespread problem in North American society, especially in our judicial system. Often people's judgments are affected by cultural and racial factors, whether consciously or subconsciously, and this movie captures this aspect of human nature perfectly. The acting was very good, with Henry Fonda and Lee Cobb having the stand out performances. They pull off their roles as the two polar opposites very well, and the other 10 characters fit in-between them on the personality spectrum. As the movie progresses the tension increases, and the characters struggle with their own convictions. The jury room seems to close in on them as they all take their turns debating and stating their opinions. Even though there is no action, and the plot is pushed forward solely by dialogue, the movie still totally engrosses you as a viewer, which establishes it as a true cinema classic. 9/10",12 Angry Men
889,misha-wilkin,A Classic not to be Missed,8,17 March 2003,"The plot of12 Angry Men revolves around the murder trail of a Latino boy who is accused of killing his father. The conviction of the boy would mean a death sentence and the destiny of the boy's life is in the hands of twelve male jurors of ranging personalities. The case seems open and shut with a murder weapon and several witnesses to place the boy at the scene of the crime. For eleven of the jurors the decision is apparent that the boy is guilty but for one juror, Mr. Davis (Henry Fonda), the boy's life should entail some discussion to eliminate any reasonable doubt the jurors may have. As the film progresses the personalities of the jurors become apparent and many underlying issues influence the guilty decision chosen by the majority of the jurors.The underlying issues are the complexity of the personalities of the jurors and the reasons why they have the motivation to feel and act the way they do. As the case unfolds further, more is learned about each juror individually. The personalities range from being a short-tempered loud mouth to a straight- laced accountant who never breaks a sweat. As the movie progresses much more is learned of the characters that exposes the intricacy of human nature and people's different personality traits. This film is an excellent example of movie making that does not require elaborate sets to entertain the viewer. The majority of the film takes place in a jury room with the men never leaving the room from their deliberation responsibilities. The cast and dialogue make this film memorable and the film has some clear moral issues that are addressed. The main issue is that not everything is as it seems. With further analysis the understanding of a situation becomes more concrete enabling the men to make a solid decision that affects a young man's life. 12 Angry Men is a classic film that should not be missed.",12 Angry Men
890,jordan-trydal,12 Angry Men,8,23 March 2003,"There's not much you can say about a movie that takes place in one room for the whole movie.  I thought it was a good movie, not a great movie though. I liked how the one juror stood his ground the whole time and was able to persuade all the jurors to do so as well.  Considering the other jurors thought that it was an open and shut case as soon as they entered the juror room to vote.  There were so many distinct and different personalities in all the jurors; that's what made the movie so interesting.  There are not many 1950 movies that got my attention like this one.  It kept me on the edge of my seat, and kept me thinking all the way through the movie. (Was he guilty or not?) I like how Fonda stayed with his instincts about the flaws in the witness's testimony all the way through the movie. I also like how the director made it seem like you're the 13th juror.  It had the camera at everyone's eye level around the juror table to get the feeling that you're in the room with them, it really gets you involved.  Even though the movie is half a century old; it's still as relevant today as it was fifty years ago.  I'm sure there is juror rooms today that go through the same kind of controversy as the movie did.  And that is why I give the movie an 8/10.",12 Angry Men
891,sbjwgrubb,A little bit of all of us in this film.,8,16 February 2003,"To me one of the things that makes a film a good one is how much it makes you think and how much you find yourself discussing it afterwards.  My wife and I spent a great deal of time following the film discussing it.  What makes this film so good is that it reveals so much of what we are as individuals and the prejudices that we carry.  What else it shows is how much passion that can be expressed during arguments.  Think about a big argument you had with someone.  Remember how you passionately tried to persuade them how WRONG they were and how RIGHT you were.  In passionate argument logic can sometimes get thrown to the wayside.  This film has that and you can see yourself in these characters.  You get to see how rediculous it can get when you argue a point without solid reasoning.  Again, that is what made this film so good for me.  You can analyze it so many ways. This is definitely worth the investment of time to see.  For provacative thought and excellent acting I give this film 8 of 10 stars.",12 Angry Men
892,motownmaniax,One of a kind,10,17 March 2005,"I echo every comment I've read up to now on why this is such a great film. Here's mine.Classic films need to have everything going for them: superior acting, compelling story, amazing direction. Notice I left out special effects or genre-specific idiosyncrasies like dramatic chase sequences in action films or singing and dancing in musicals. Depending on the type of film, these elements are definitely needed, of course, but what propels any film into classic status is the absolute necessity of the basics I first mentioned. Any deficiency in one category automatically downgrades my rating to just a very good movie, no matter how big the explosions or realistic the gore (I love horror movies, too).As any film buff knows, most movies are adequate to downright terrible. However, even the bad ones can be entertaining in a fast food, disposable kind of way (we all have our guilty pleasures, and I know my list is rather long...lol). It's when we come across a movie that fires on all cylinders that truly inspires joy, and reveals why great film-making moves us.12 Angry Men is one of those rare movies for me. It's almost disarmingly simple and straightforward. It's drama frighteningly intense. I understand why some may view the film as dated, or have a problem with the era from which it was made. I take into account all the cultural differences between then and now (the all-white male jury, the American slang, the one-dimensional setting) but none of it matters because the story, direction, and acting are so good. The morality of the story is the focus, not the backdrop.I don't see this movie being irrelevant 100 years from now. In fact, if present social trends continue, it may be even more important, considering how we seem to be careening to a less moral, instant gratification society where personal responsibility is secondary to selfish needs. Movies like this may become a beacon for thoughtfulness and sanity. But I digress; apologies for soap boxing.As much as I hate lists, I would easily place this movie in my Top Ten of All-Time.",12 Angry Men
893,philshuh,One of the most Important films ever made,10,3 January 2005,"I first saw this film about 16 years ago. I had recently seen an episode from ""Hancock's Half Hour"" entitled 12 Angry Men which involved Tony Hancock trying to convince a Jury that Sid James was innocent. The episode was excellent and then after looking in the paper I noticed that this film was to be shown. I thought it only right to see the inspiration behind the aforementioned episode. I must have been 15 at the time but from the moment Martin Balsam first asks the members of the Jury to raise their hands I was hooked. The highly talented cast give superb performances that are enhanced by the excellent camera work, brilliant script and thought provoking subject matter. I recently saw the remake starring Jack Lemmon and thought it to have some great twists on the original. Particularly on Ed Begley's character from the original film. All in all though, what makes the original is the intimacy the camera has on each member of the jury, the claustrophobic atmosphere of the movie and the tension between the characters. Sidney Lumet has created a masterpiece here and thoroughly deserves to be in the top 100 movies of all time.",12 Angry Men
894,aswinkurungot,Outstanding movie,10,13 September 2013,The film is about jury consisting of 12 people which met for a murder trial. The film starts with just one person who has reasonable doubt that the accused is not guilty. As the film passes he tries to convince others that he may not be guilty. The way the movie is directed is simply outstanding. The movie proceeds with just dialogues. I have never seen any other movie in which a plot has been executed so amazingly. The movie puts most of the modern films to shame. Without much visual effects and technology the plain storytelling style guarantees that any viewer would be enthralled watching it.

Seriously awful waste of time here. If you want a good older movie watch Treasure of the Sierra Madre or Casablanca or just about anything else over this.I try to find good in everything and I just don't get why people give this one such a high rating.

896,git011,Subtle and Paced Well,7,3 February 2005,"As for the previous man's post regarding the lack of cinematic pyrotechnics in this films, I'd like to mention that I thought the means with which this story was told was actually quite brilliant. Sure, there are dated elements to the dialogue and we've come quite a long way technologically with which to please the visual sense. Further it seems that our ""eyes"" have grown accustomed to jump cuts and when they are lacking, well, it's sort of like the analogy of a fast food meal versus a sit down dinner. While a burger and fries are fine, even fantastic at times, it sure ain't a meal you'll never forget. With films like this you have to slow yourself down and appreciate the manner with which it is told. Thoughtful framing and movement of camera subconsciously underscore the message. And ultimately a good story told well is all I ask for from a movie, regardless of frills and CG. I liked it.",12 Angry Men

902,mphill61,A pure mix of human characters,10,16 March 2005,"I saw it in an 8th grade Civics class and it has been my all time favorite film ever since. Most court dramas show you the trial, the lawyers, the witnesses, and the verdict. This takes a trial from a unique prospective, from the jurors who actually make the decisions. It runs the full range of human personalities. Juror 1 was thrust into the position of foreman; he struggles to lead as near chaos seems to erupt around him. Juror 2, a small weak individual who gets kicked around for most of the film. Juror 3 appears to have no personal feelings in the case, but frequently loses his temper. Juror 4, a cold, endifferent, arrogant stock broker who doesn't even sweat, practically a robot. Juror 5 came from the same background as the defendant and is desperate to appear unbiased. Juror 6, a simple construction worker who wants to see justice done. Juror 7, the class clown of the jury, appears to know right frome wrong, but just wants to get to the baseball game on time. Juror 8, the central character, a passionate, progressive thinker who believes in the power of one individual. Juror 9, a wise old man who brings a unique prospective to the case. Juror 10, white trash, pure and simple. Juror 11, a foreign immigrant who believes in truth, justice, and the American way. Juror 12, a business man who at times finds himself in over his head. It may be possible to predict how one of these personalities might vote, but this film shows that you cannot predict how they will interact with each other and how this interaction will affect the outcome.",12 Angry Men

The jury member played by Henry Fonda has some good and valid points on how a detective should've solved the case. Also, if you watch closely, the clothing wore by Henry Fonda is made out of white cloth, and his character is trying to save the life of the convict, which means he is shown to viewers as an angel of mercy, while the jury member played by Lee J.

The conviction of the boy by other juries show how easily people can be swayed and follow general public's opinion even the juries.

909,DanielArberry99,Brilliance in one room,10,24 October 2016,"Jury duty is a service in which different people take in different manners and approach it with different minds. Some who have never experienced it feel obliged to express a close interest while other regular jurors show less empathy towards the accused. These 12 men were expecting the usual court case of assault, robbery or another petty crime. However, the 18 year old suspect was accused of murdering his father by sticking a switchblade 4 inches into the center of his chest. The trial went on for several days until it was time for the 12 men to go off into a small, muggy room and agree on one life changing decision, guilty or not guilty. A verdict was made rapidly as most of the jurors accused the boy of being guilty; exempt from this one man who stood by his vote of not guilty.From here on out, the tale is thrilling. Most of the jurors believed the boy was guilty but weren't 100% sure, and the one exempt juror stood by his vote of not guilty as he believed the life of an 18 year old boy deserved a little more debate and thought. Unlike others, such as one man who had baseball game tickets for that night and the owner of a business who has work to do, this man was willing and brave enough to stand against 11 others and fight his case. For the first 20 minutes of the film, this fierce man stood alone against 11 angry men as he wasn't completely convinced that the boy was guilty. That is an incredibly brave and caring thing to do. As the jurors spent the evening tracing back over evidence and alibis and small details of the witnesses, one by one, this unique man managed to persuade each juror to change their verdict to save an innocent boy from the electric chair.This film gripped me from the beginning as it touched on the jurors' backstories and camera angles slowly got closer as the film edged to its final verdict. It depicts that one man can change the world. Through close analysis of evidence and exceptional charisma, one man succeeded in changing the minds of 11 other stubborn men who all stood against him to begin with. This film was set in the 1950's which was a time of high discrimination against many races. The writers cleverly left the suspect's race and ethnicity unknown to show the jurors could be talking about anyone. It is revealed that the suspect grew up in a slum however, which caused prejudice from some jurors. The fact that a man can stand for an unfortunate boy and empathize for his background inspires me. It shows what humans can do, inspire a generation, and what humans have done. The work of people such as Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks and Nelson Mandela is truly incredible. Inspiration and persuasion are powerful tools in this world and we must use them in the right way to create a better future for ourselves and our descendants.The themes of this film were fantastic despite the majority of the screen time being spent in one room. It had justice, family, honor, death and many more deeper meanings and teachings about life. It shows that you don't need a high budget or special effects to make a great film; all you need is a thrilling tale, incredible acting and hidden morals. I have scored this film 8/10.

Voting is done, 11 people are guilty, one man is innocent. This is none other than Davis. Davis represents an intellectual in the film.

How to keep someone during 90 minutes in front of the TV without moving? You can tie him to the sofa, or you can put ""12 angry men"" on the screen. This film is the perfect example of how sometimes greats dialogues and better facial expressions can give much more than other kinds of action.

Yes, so many fantastic films were made then. It was one of them. But it has a unique concept/story.All the actors did absolute justice to their respective characters, and I love all of them. I am just totally killed by such a brilliant movie with such brilliant performers. Among them, Lee J Cobb (Juror-3), and Ed Begley (Juror-10) caught my eyes a bit more as I think they were just simply at top notch. Lee J Cobb got the hardest role full of emotions, laughter, anger and what not and he did it with class and ease. Ed Begley also had a tough role of doing an act of having cold, and look how realistically he delivered that. The honest dedication and commitment of all the 12 actors towards their roles deserve high appreciation. The only thing that I have a slight difference of opinion is about the title of the movie. It is a good title, all right. But there could be another title because Henry Fonda (Juror-8) was not actually an angry man, rather he remained very calm. Same was with jurors-1, 3, 9, and 12. The title could be ""A Pending Decision"" or ""12 Jurors"", or something better. This film will remain one of my top most favorite films forever.",12 Angry Men

It revolves around the one juror, (Henry Fonda) having the guts to stand up to the crowd & voice his uncertainty with the conclusion that the others have reached.

Those valid points triggered the latent detective of the other jury members, and they gradually started favouring ""not guilty"" by making logical points.I was astonished to hear about the depression imprints made by glasses on the lady witness's nose,Which was first acknowledged by the oldest jury member.

But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption.The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made.

963,rajkowski,`Twelve Men turned into twelve clawing animals',9,22 February 2002,"<<POSSIBLE SPOILER WITHIN>>No film is perfect, and indeed it is a rare jewel to find a film where there are even one or two perfect scenes  the point where everything is in harmony  script, direction, acting, camera, and lighting. Twelve Angry Men is mostly made of these jewels, and is up there in my top ten films.Part of the Sidney Lumet's skill lies in his ability to realistically capture rapid exchanges between characters, whilst keeping a larger perspective and not losing orientation. By using a range of editing and camera techniques  fast cuts, close ups, low camera angles, high camera angles the film is very dynamic and fluid. All of the characters are given enough room to breathe, which is no small feat with such a large group. Indeed many of the great directors openly admit that they find scenes involving interchanges amongst groups of people extremely taxing, Frankenheimer  and Kieslowski spring to mind (Kieslowski even went so far to say that's why all his films have so few characters.) Echoing the core theme of the film, we are given different perspectives of the set - one time we may feel like a lingering voyeur, hidden at the back of the room, another a lonely juror being stared at by all the others, another pressed close against a jurors face  feeling his emotions boiling over, clouding his judgment. It is this wide variety of techniques, and of course a magnificent script that makes the film infinitely enjoyable.Henry Fonda's juror seems to know all the evidence's weaknesses from the start, however he only drip feeds the other jurors one idea at a time. He seems to have that perennial quality of heroes  an almost superhuman knowing' quality coupled with great hubris or modesty, signified by his reiteration that he doesn't 'know' that the evidence is wrong, just not beyond reasonable doubt. All of the other juror's are played excellently, I particularly relished the old mans performance.I have a few minor' criticisms of the film, but they are just that - minor. I think the racist juror's outburst is a little too over acted; this does however give the opportunity for a wonderfully stylized rejection by the other jurors.Some of the films highlights to me are near the end when we realise that the last stubborn juror wants to punish the accused as a proxy for his son. (Some people may have picked this up earlier though). Also the superb final shot where the old man asks Henry Fonda's juror his name.Another interesting point that I only realised after finishing the film for the first time was that there were no female jurors.On particular historical interest is the original theatrical trailer, complete with studio hyped commentary such as `Twelve Men turned into twelve clawing animals', and a surprising injection of a James Bond / Mission impossible like tune midway through. . I've only brushed the surface of some of the film's great aspects, there are so many impressive things it would take many pages more to discuss all of them. Whether you're in the mood for a comedy, a drama, a thriller, or even a light philosophical view on justice this film fits the bill.enjoy.",12 Angry Men

The movie is on the very short list of works defined as 'classical' in the Aristotelian sense for respecting the three unities which make up a classical masterpiece - unity of action, unity of time, unity of place.The drama was first adapted to the stage and then to the screen in 1957 and 1997; my preference goes to the 1957 version because of the stellar performance given by Henry Fonda, nominated for both a Golden Globe and a BAFTA (won) in 1958.www.thesmartfashionistas.com",12 Angry Men

970,radiosonde,INTP wins the day!,10,1 August 2005,"This is a movie about characters. ""Personalities"" come in second.The architect, an archtypical example of the Myers Briggs INTP type, saves the trial from going into disaster owing to a lack of consideration of key points.At this point, let me quote Jean Kummerow (et al), famous authors in the subject of this kind of type analysis. It refers to the Henry Fonda character's personality.""INTPs are known for their quest for logical purity, which motivates them to examine universal truths and principles. They are constantly asking themselves and others the questions 'Why?' and 'Why not?' Clear and quick thinkers, they are able to focus with great intensity on their interests. They appreciate elegance and efficiency in thought processes and require them, even more so, in their own communications. They may be seen as unwilling to accept what everyone else regards as truth. While often low key in outward appearance and approach, the INTP is 'hard as nails' when challenging a truth. INTPs do not like to deal with the obvious. They are at their best in building conceptual models and developing unusual and complex ideas."" This is what Juror 8 demonstrates right from the beginning. Not every INTP exhibits every feature listed above, but enough to get that point across. I recommend you conduct some research into Myers Briggs personality classifications if you are interested in understanding humans from a scientific viewpoint. There are ""tons"" of stuff on the web about this.I haven't bothered to fully assess the personalities of the other jurors. But on a second viewing, it could be interesting. We know nothing about the personality of the accused. We don't need to.",12 Angry Men

Anyway, this movie is a drama, and the 12 Angry Men are jurors in a murder case(I guess this was back in the day when women didn't serve on juries?). The movie is about one Juror (#8) and his attempts to convince the other 11 that the young man accused of murder is not guilty.I don't know if this is considered a spoiler or not but the best part of the whole movie is the dramatic exchange between Juror #8 (the guy who thinks the accused might not be guilty) and Juror #3 (the bombastic juror) near the end of the show.**warning don't read if you don't like spoilers. While I'm not sure if the following is a spoiler, the IMDb is pretty strict about spoiling movies in reviews. They say I will be blacklisted. Whatever, you've been warned, now back to the best part of the movie.**Juror #3 says, ""I'll kill you!"" or ""I'm gonna kill you"" or something like that and Juror #8 says, ""You don't really mean that do you?"" Then Juror #3 gets this wonderful sequence of expressions on his face of anger turning into confusion turning into disgust turning into defeat turning into confusion. Yeah, I think he shows confusion twice. He's initially confused at the rapidity and perspicacity of Juror #8's retort and then finally confused about how he could have been wrong all along. What is so brilliant about this sequence (aside from the wonderful acting - reminiscent of a scene in an episode of Quantum Leap where Sam sings ""Imagine"" to his younger sister and her expression goes through a sequence of changes - but boy is that way off-topic) is the setup and payoff. Juror #3 is so convinced the accused is guilty, especially since the accused was heard by someone (it's been a while since I've seen the movie so forgive me if I'm not entirely accurate here) to have said, ""I'm gonna kill you"" or ""her"" or whatever. Then Juror #8 lays a trap for #3 and he walks right in - and it's some good viewin'. See I didn't even spoil it all that much. I didn't even tell you how it ends. It ends well.

Well that's what my perception was for years and was determined not to bother regardless of the strength of the reviews both from critics and fans.But films that are mad as among the best have good reason for their reputations (usually). Like Citizen Kane I had to eat humble pie after watching this one. Even though I had already read how the film ended the journey was never less than fascinating and intense with some interesting points raised about class privileges and prejudices against people one might look down on based on their type. All the characters were fully fleshed and there were a lot of shades of grey to work through.I love modern action extravaganzas such as The Avengers as much as the next guy but the beauty of film means that there is a full spectrum of diverse stories to be appreciated.

980,dyorkfan007,Best movie. Ever.,10,26 June 2003,"Now, I've never been the type of person who is impressed by flashy set designs, special effects, non-stop action, etc. In fact, the most important things for me in any type of story (film, television, play, novel) is characterization. I'm a sucker for good, complex, three-dimensional characters. And dialogue. Boy, do I ever go crazy over good dialogue. This is most likely why 12 Angry Men is my favorite movie of all time. Twelve men, one room, fabulous acting, fabulous cast, fabulous dialogue. Brilliant.The cast itself is enough to drive you crazy. Henry Fonda, one of my favorite actors of all time, leads the pack, with Lee J. Cobb, Ed Begley, Jack Klugman, and E.G. Marshall putting in excellent performances too. In fact, this is one of Lee J. Cobb's best performances ever. He's tremendous in this role and you really just can't help but like him in the end. E.G. Marshall puts forth maybe the best performance in the entire film with his calm and intelligent character as the perfect balance to Cobb's angry and out of control character. Also, notable performances by Joseph Sweeney and John Fiedler, who are both entirely endearing.There's not a lot to say about this amazing film. Anyone who has any interest in the American legal system should definitely watch this. If you appreciate good casting, excellent acting, and first-rate dialogue, you won't be disappointed. It's odd to think that a movie about twelve nameless men sitting around in one room talking for most of the movie could continue to be interesting the whole way through, but somehow they do it.",12 Angry Men
981,rmyers7,A Contrarian View,6,17 October 2016,"I've always have had problems with this movie. Seeing it listed so highly made me re-watch it and give it another assessment. It has never struck me as a ""movie"". It's a closed set drama of twelve men talking in a closed room. That presents a pretty high bar to get over to turn it into a movie. Unfortunately it doesn't even seem to try to get over it.This movie is a turd sitting there. A highly polished sincere turd, but a turd nonetheless.First the setup. A young man is on trial for murdering his father, stabbing him with a switchblade, apparently as a result of an argument. From statements in the movie, it seems that he is a member of a despised, slum-dwelling minority. The boy is shown to be dark but 'white'. The actor who plays the juror that is his compatriot is Jack Klugman, of Russian Jewish heritage. Was an audience meant to take seriously, even in the '50s that assimilated Jews were on such a low social rung? Were they meant to be some other swarthy European? Italian, Greek, perhaps? To me the only folks likely to be identified that way in '50s NY would be blacks or Puerto Ricans. I know that Hollywood at the time had a real problem casting actors of color, but this whitewashing takes me out of any willing suspension of disbelief.Then the jurors themselves. They almost all seem one dimensional tropes. Let's go in order: 1) The foreman, a High School Football coach. Just trying to keep the process rolling, without a high degree of insight into the issues.2) The mousy accountant. Not assertive or expecting to be listened to if he did assert himself.3) Likely the most interesting, a self-made business man, who has issues with a man needing to be 'manly'; assertive to the point of bullying. He has a failed relationship with his own son that is the key to his behavior on the jury.4) A stockbroker. A bland technocrat who never sweats. He seems almost the post-war Nazi stereotype of 'only following orders'.5) The representative of the under-class. So scared of appearing to favor 'one of his own kind', that he compensates by going with the prevailing social order.6) The common man. At Passover he'd be the son that 'knows not how to ask'.7) The salesman. Approaches this as a sales pitch, and wants to get it over with to be able to get to tonight's Yankees game.8) Our beloved identification figure. Wants to avoid the rush to judgment. An architect he (possibly along with his antithesis the stockbroker) is the best educated and well spoken of the bunch. Literally 'the man in the white suit'. Congratulations to you Mr. audience member for smugly identifying with him.9) The old man. Given to pearls of insight that derive from his experience and wisdom.10) The racist. Even if the kid isn't guilty, his kind are troublemakers and deserve what they get.11) The good immigrant. A watchmaker, quiet, polite, well spoken.12) The ad man. Got to have one of these in any '50s NY set story. Send his gray flannel suit up the flag pole and see if anyone salutes it.Are any of these, with the possible exception of #3, real human beings?The argument. The bulk of this exercise is the destruction, point by point of the prosecution's case. A highlight is when #8 presents the jury with a duplicate of the supposedly unique murder weapon, a similar one which was purchased by the by the young man. I'm not a student of the law, but I can't believe that such a introduction of such evidence into jury deliberations is acceptable procedure. Also, although the prosecution's case is sufficiently demolished to introduce the reasonable doubt necessary for an acquittal, never is a plausible alternate scenario is never offered. Why did some intruder enter the murdered man's apartment and kill him? Robbery? Never suggested. Another gang-banger looking for the son? Why was the man stabbed in a non-experienced way? Why is the murder weapon clean of fingerprints?So, well acted, competently shot, but to my mind a failed drama, and still a non-movie.Finally, with over 900 member reviews I expect that this will be buried. And, why do we need a spoiler tag on a nearly sixty year old movie?",12 Angry Men
982,kosmalag,"A cheesy, predictable, classic.",9,3 March 2015,"12 Angry Men is an undeniably great film, whose simplistic directing and predictable plot ultimately take it away from a 10/10.The story focuses on one man's struggle to convince a jury of 12, 11 of whom disagree with him on the verdict, to acquit a young man of his father's murder.Instead of spending this review describing how important this movie is, how well-thought out the script is, or how impressive the individual acting of most jurors is, I shall attempt to pinpoint the movies very significant weaknesses.First, and most importantly, the movie has some of the most disgustingly heavy-handed, and cheesy moments I have ever seen in a film of this caliber. 1. The scene where the German corrects the racists' English. 2. The scene where Juror 8 calls Juror 3 out on his exclamation of ""I'm going to kill him!"" 3. The scene where everybody gradually stands up to show their backs to the speaking Juror 10. Juror 10 then goes down to sit in the corner, like a naughty kid, never to speak again for the remaining duration of the movie. 4. The sweating Juror 4 as Juror 8 proves him wrong, despite him apparently ""never sweating."" 5. Juror 3 finally giving up after a long tirade at the end of the movie.Secondly, the movie is extraordinarily caricatural in its portrayal of some of the characters (in order of submission to juror 8): Jurors 7, 10, and 3. They were all under developed and largely portrayed as either bigoted, stubborn beyond reasonable doubt (pun intended), or frivolously disinterested beyond belief.Finally, the extraordinarily simplistic camera work was useful for setting the tone. However, the fact that no characters outside the shot in any specific scenes were allowed to butt in on conversations made the entire movie seem very preachy with only the characters being convinced to change their votes one by one involved in any one scene at a time, along with Juror 8, and occasionally Juror 9. Furthermore, the focus on certain characters led to unbearably long monologues that were hardly believably in a 12-man jury debate. (Renoir in ""Rules of the Game,"" in 1939, had already innovated far beyond this type of constrictive and simplistic camera work and directing.) The anarchy that would have been undeniable in a similar situation therefore end up having to be portrayed through unbearably loud and plainly stupid caricatures listed above^.In conclusion, the movie is a great one, but it has undeniable weaknesses that are so strong, they take it away from a 10/10.",12 Angry Men
983,ihenckel,Angry for another reason,10,14 April 2012,"Twelve angry men. Anger is the appropriate response to injustice and violence; the anger of the law in this case means the defendant will be executed. But each juror at the start of the movie is angry for a wrong reason. Even juror number 8 (Fonda) votes ""not guilty"" not because he has a reasonable doubt but because he is offended by the haste of the other jurors. Tempers cool as each juror changes his verdict, until only one angry man is left.One of the great pieces of cinema, 12 Angry Men is art that offers to be studied, discussed and interpreted rather than reviewed. Though understated (what one juror terms a ""soft sell"") it is powerful, thought-provoking and never dull. It finally demonstrates that in film, as in theatre, story and character are central, while action, setting and special effects are extraneous.That is to say, see it. It may change you.",12 Angry Men
984,tdibug,"Great, but not without shortfalls",6,31 October 2003,"Superb camera work, dialogue, and acting.  Cinematically, the film is top notch.  Certainly a film that would not or could not be duplicated today. A sweat-shop of emotions, ideas and interactions and a personal favorite of mine (I purchased the DVD).  All the positive points have been covered here so I won't repeat them.But the film does have a problem or two, which have become more evident to me with each subsequent viewing.  Firstly, it is awash with political correctness and character stereo-typing.  The `hold-outs' for a guilty verdict are depicted as bigots, authoritarians or dumb sports nuts (E.G. Marshall is the lone exception).   The film, bordering on greatness, cannot seem to shake the `liberal' (good) vs. `conservative' (bad) overtones, which is truly unfortunate.  As a result, the movie becomes more `preachy' than introspective or instructive.  It is also predictable.A second problem is the actual arguments made that sway the Jury.  Real juries do not (hopefully) reason in such a manner.  For example, Fonda takes testimony from an eyewitness to the killing and calls it into question because of some vague assumptions: 1) The witness (a woman) had marks on her nose that resemble those made by eyeglasses - so the assumption is she wore glasses. 2) People normally don't wear glasses to bed - the assumption is she mustn't have either, therefore  3) She couldn't have identified the killer as she rose from her bed and looked out the window!  As Lee J. Cobb CORRECTLY pointed out, perhaps the marks were made from sun glasses or reading glasses..who knows, she may have had her glasses ON when she saw the killing (of course none of this is brought up in court).  But because of this convoluted logic, another 2 or 3 jurors are swayed to the `not guilty' side.  There are other examples equally as egregious.Finally, the scene where Ed Begley spouts his bigoted nonsense and the jurors leave the table one by one is absolutely horrific and non-believable. It is these `chinks in the armor' that again, hold the movie back from it's full potential.
Criticisms aside, the acting is wonderful.  Lee J. Cobb should have won an Oscar.  E.G. Marshall is excellent.  Jack Klugman and Martin Balsam are also very good.  Fonda is adequate, but not at his best.  Jack Warden and John Fielder play their `character roles' well as one would expect.

As the discussion proceeds and the contrast between them gets to a peak, each of them starts to revise the initial decision.",12 Angry Men
998,Xkinhe,Lumet's Finest,10,3 September 2016,"Lumet's staggering courtroom drama 12 Angry Men mostly takes place in the cramped jury room where a dozen ""men with ties"" decide the fate of Puerto Rican teenager accused of murdering his abusive father. Yet the prologue to their civic imprisonment, which takes place beyond these confined walls, sets the stage for Lumet's overarching concerns about the contradictions of the democratic process. After a few short establishing shots where men, women, and children traverse the plaza steps and interior hallways of the court building, Lumet and director of photography Boris Kaufman focus on a particular door, where one of many cases currently in motion is just about to reach critical mass. The legal arguments have subsided, leaving the courtroom mostly silent and the fate of the accused in the hands of the aforementioned 12 white men. Before their dismissal, the judge looks down at the group and bequeaths them to ""separate the fact from the fancy."" Despite his harsh tone, we quickly realize only one of them takes this statement seriously.That man is Juror 8 (Henry Fonda), the lone dissenting voice during the jury's disturbingly jovial initial vote to convict the boy of first- degree murder, which would send him to the electric chair. Juror 8 has questions, a lot of them that he wants to discuss further, much to the chagrin of his fellow jurors. ""There's always one,"" yells sarcastic Juror 10 (Ed Begley), who, like many of his fellow deliberators, desires a quick conviction so that they can all get back to their regular lives. In the minds of the other 11 men, the evidence is overwhelming in favor of the prosecution, so why even bother with debate. But Juror 8's resistance to such mob mentality and manipulation helps erode the devastating moral righteousness of men like Juror 3 (Lee J. Cobb), whose certainty about the boy's guilt is just one of the many red flags to surface during the proceedings. Slowly but surely, Juror 8 forces each man to look beyond their own prejudices—to question the evidence at hand and to become active participants in the judicial process.What's most interesting about the intense deliberations that ensue, specifically when a piece of seemingly indisputable evidence is brought back into question, is how a fresh angle and perspective, usually born from Juror 8's critical thinking, can permanently alter the tone of the discussion. As this trend becomes more of a factor, each character begins to show their true colors in relation to the case. Whether it's a bit of blatant racism from Juror 10, extreme hatred from Juror 3, or a sobering plea of humanity from Juror 8, Lumet shoots the most important lines of dialogue in close-up, lingering on the characters' faces for extended moments, establishing the importance of proximity and duration when it comes to dramatic shifts in the story. It's almost as if Fonda's character, and Lumet for that matter, believes these men are smart enough to make the correct decision if given the context and time to carefully consider the ramifications of their actions. Despite some crippling character flaws, laziness and apathy are the only real villains here.Aesthetically, 12 Angry Men is a master class in refurbished cinematic space. It takes a confined, almost completely banal real- world location and makes it completely dynamic, using incredibly nimble camera movements to establish character motivation and theme. Kaufman's fluid long takes track each character as they leave the table in anger and frustration, the men departing for sporadic moments of personal reflection before returning to the heated discussion. Seemingly simple conversations lead to damning assumptions about ideology and purpose, and each man brings their own set of moral baggage to the table. This allows the location to grow in depth as the characters become more fully developed. In turn, the smooth visuals have a strange effect on the narrative itself; they juxtapose a narrative seamlessness of cause and effect with the building uneasiness in each man, creating a volatile and unpredictable feel that rivals the extreme shifts in weather (from sweltering heat to torrential downpour) beyond the juror room windows.Incredibly, 12 Angry Men was Lumet's feature directorial debut, a fact that remains massively impressive considering the film's meticulous craft and pacing. Harboring just as much compulsive energy and momentum as most modern Hollywood action films, 12 Angry Men makes every shot and line of dialogue count. It's a film immersed in the organic relationship between façade and perspective, how each character tries to hide their own weaknesses by lashing out at others. ""Prejudice always obscures the truth,"" one Juror finally says at the end of the film. As the unnamed men depart and walk down the courthouse steps, it's finally clear that some of them understand how that particularly true statement relates to their own conflicted, ambiguous, and flawed life experience.",12 Angry Men
999,bviktor98,Timeless classic. Not by accident.,10,22 July 2015,"This is a subjective review, so it shows only my opinion about this movie. This is a very exciting story about 12 jurors quarreling over the fate of the accused, but it's more profound than that. The main character (played by Henry Fonda) is the only one, who believes that the accused guy is not guilty. He tries to convince the other jurors to agree with his opinion. The brilliant thing in this is that the actual happenings are not known for them(nor the viewer), so even we can't be sure, if they make the right or the wrong choice. As the story progresses, the viewer himself is to be convinced by either side. All of the jurors have personalities, not one of them is trite. It's a great achievement for the movie to build up such characters in very little time.The atmosphere is great as it draws in the viewer, and the talent of the actors are shown clearly, because the film doesn't have corny action, or gore like many of them nowadays, it's just pure acting, and directing. I can not mention a mistake, not even by today's standards. There have been so many attempts to make something perfect, but this is one of the few ones in my opinion, which really is. It was made by little money, in b&w and it only adds to its charm. I give this movie a 10/10, one of my personal favourites.",12 Angry Men

It seems to be quite obvious to the majority of the jurors that the kid is guilty, except for one man.

The crescendo of the action creates a sense of impending change that characterizes the film. Another interesting concept is that our perceptions can sometimes be so different even when exposed to the same material. We bring our life experiences into making every decision we make and in the case of this film that can have catastrophic results for someone else.

There were a couple characters who clearly were the bad guys from the start and their positions were never justified, just shown to be illogical and they eventually realize it. There was a single character in the movie who felt real to me, with the rest more or less fulfilling a purpose in delivering the message of the movie. It was inspiring to some extent and has some important messages about being able to change your opinions in light of superior information.

His portrayal of anger and frustration is outstanding. Henry Fonda is as assured as usual - the voice of reason - but Cobb plays a man driven by his own demons who finally breaks, and as he does so, the jury are at last speaking with one voice.

Most of the film takes place inside a small jury room - no extravagant sets in this movie. This gives us incentive to focus on the three strengths of the film - the acting, the dialogue (written by Reginald Rose) and the direction (by first-time director Sidney Lumet).The acting is outstanding. There is a long shot that takes place before any talk of the case, and simply based off this shot, we can tell so much about these characters - which way they will vote, whether they can relate to the boy on trial, and which of them will collide in the future. Special mentions of course go to Lee J. Cobb and Henry Fonda, the two opposites whose conversations are some of the most interesting in the whole movie. Lee J, Cobb's revelation scene at the end of the movie alone shows how multilayered he can play his characters.The dialogue is spectacular, and I am of the opinion it is one of the best scripts ever written for the movie screen - possibly the best. Every character speaks based on their motivations: Juror 5 speaks based on his experience as a kid from the poorer areas, Juror 3 speaks based on his own son, and Juror 7 speaks based on his desire to get to a baseball game. These motivations color their arguments and distinguish each of them from their peers, and ths is exemplified in the script. This film also contains the single greatest line in film history, delivered by Juror No. 8 to Juror No. 3 after No. 3 threatens his life. When you watch the scene, you'll know the line.And finally, the directing is masterful. The film's limited set means that the director, Sidney Lumet, had to come up with creative ways to frame shots to aid the film's storytelling. He does this by shooting in wide shots at the start of the movie, and slowly bringing the camera closer to the actor's faces, putting more emphasis on their reactions and reinforcing the claustrophobic size of the room. The scene where the men walk into the outside at the end is basically catharsis.12 Angry Men is a smart and engaging movie, and feels like it was made with every element completely fine-tuned to make one of the greatest movies of all time. I think this movie needs to be seen by everyone, not just to enjoy it, but to see how dialogue can be used masterfully to enhance a story.",12 Angry Men

The basic plot revolves around a jury deliberating on a murder case that will send the accused to the electric chair, if he is found guilty. A preliminary vote is taken, and all but one of the jurors vote for guilty.
Over the course of the movie the one juror who votes not guilty (Henry Fonda) makes his case, and the other jurors being to realise that the verdict is not as clear cut as they first thought. One of the interesting things about this movie is that each juror has their own reasons for their opinion, be it the facts of the case, or personal prejudices, and over the course of the movie these are confronted and explored.Despite being set in a single room, this movie is constantly entertaining, due to the acting and direction. The film feels incredibly tense and claustrophobic as a result of this. It was only afterwards I found out that Sidney Lumet also directed Dog Day Afternoon, another great movie that is based entirely in one setting.In an age of special effects and the constant high budget dross being pumped out of Hollywood, it's refreshing to see a movie based purely on dialogue and acting ability. There have been too few of these in recent years, although a few do come to mind- Glengarry Glen Ross, Swimming With Sharks, Usual Suspects, Memento.Many people today may see the date this movie was made or the fact that it is in black and white and not bother watching it.

I think this movie deserves more credit than it's given, specifically because the meaning of it goes much deeper than a simple jury trying to decide whether a youth is innocent or guilty. Human nature and emotion is shown on many different levels, ranging from personal prejudice to calm indifference. All of the Jurors are interesting in their own way, but I think it's particularly because of his apathy that I find Juror #7 the most captivating. It might be due to his incredible lack of interest or to his constant humor that serves to ease the situation, albeit for a short time. He's not a *bad* person, but his character and some of his dialog (i.e. ""I got a different method. Laughs, drinks, jokes...tricks..."" at least I think that's what he said; I wish there was a script I could look at)suggests that his character leans more toward cunning and, of course, trickery. I feel bad for Juror #3 at the end when he breaks down after tearing up the picture of him and his son. It's gotta be one of the more emotional scenes in the movie (which is saying something, considering that the whole movie is largely about human emotion.)All in all, I'd give this movie a 10/10.",12 Angry Men

Henry Fonda who plays the main Protagonist has to convince everyone in the room that the Defendant is in fact innocent. What you can expect after that is just a mix of emotions and brilliant drama done through masterful acting and genius writing.
If you haven't watched it already and need a reason to, just do it. There's no reason not to unless everything mentioned in this review is just not your thing.",12 Angry Men

1048,tusharkapoor-22047,12 Angry Men~ Fantabulous,10,23 December 2020,"12 Angry Men is a movie brilliantly directed by Sidney Lumet, even for 2020, it still has a tremendously intriguing storyline, too-which I was quite stunned by.It's not a typical action, run, and chase kind of film, Instead the director, Sidney Lumet focuses on a dramatically intense conversation between 12 characters, set in one ordinary room. The Writer, Reginald Rose conjures such dialogues that are extremely interesting to follow-through thus, the audience would not have a robust urge to look away, and indulge with their phones.
The movie may be ""12 Angry Men"", however as an audience I truly felt as if I were one of them or the 13th member present in the room along with them, trying to debate whether or not the convict; convicted is innocent or absolute guilty. I loved how I was legit switching sides as the diced rolled, and a few logical ideas came up, because it does force you too question the secenrio.I Don't think the movie could have ended in a better way, that it did, because, from the inside you vigriously beleive something could be the truth, however on the other side of the specturm, there are couple of theory that counterdict your existing thoughts.",12 Angry Men

From the bored judge through the scared teenager to the twelve jurors, there is no chink of characterisation which is missing. We know nothing which is normally known, someone's name, their occupation, what their interests are, and so on. But each person in the room is required to open himself up to the gaze of the other eleven; we have prejudice, contempt, alienation, cooperation, cogent analysis of circumstance, violent emotion, vacillation and even humour despite the looming death penalty. This is the king of character analysis films and the screenwriter Reginald Rose is a genius.",12 Angry Men

1053,bthjgrant,"Wonderful, intriguing movie",9,17 November 2006,"""Twelve Angry Men"" is a simple movie in that it's setting is a single, solitary jury room and it's ""excitement"" lies in the intriguing relationships and dialog between jurors during deliberation. What could be more simple than that? The trick to this movie is the powerful storyline and the absolutely magnificent acting. That said, ""Twelve Angry Men"" needs no special effects, mind-boggling action scenes or a beautiful actress co-star - instead, it relies on good, old fashioned movie making for it's intrigue. In may ways, ""The Breakfast Club"" reminds me of this movie (without the courtroom, but with a school library instead). Both movies make statements about society's biases and inequalities while exploring each character's ""stand"" on the matters at hand. At the end of both movies, all characters involved understand each other a little bit better. If you like powerful story lines and brilliant acting, this movie is for you.",12 Angry Men
1054,louisealvin,Time!,10,1 June 2020,"In the overheated jury room of the New York County Courthouse, a jury prepares to deliberate the case of an 18-year-old impoverished youth accused of stabbing his father to death. The judge instructs them that if there is any reasonable doubt, the jurors are to return a verdict of not guilty. If found guilty, the defendant will receive a death sentence. The verdict must be unanimous.
The evidence at first seems convincing. A neighbor testified to witnessing the defendant stab his father from her window. Another neighbor testified that he heard the defendant threaten to kill his father and the father's body hitting the ground, and then, through his peephole, saw the defendant run past his door. The boy has a violent past and had recently purchased a switchblade of the same type as was found at the murder scene, but claimed he lost his. The knife at the scene had been cleaned of fingerprints.
In a preliminary vote, all jurors vote guilty except Juror 8, who believes that there should be some discussion before the verdict is made. He questions the reliability of the witnesses. Producing his own switchblade, he throws doubt on the supposed uniqueness of the murder weapon. He says he cannot vote guilty because reasonable doubt exists. Juror 8 suggests a secret ballot, from which he will abstain; if all the other jurors still vote guilty, he will acquiesce. The ballot reveals one not guilty vote. Juror 9 reveals that he changed his vote, agreeing there should be more discussion.
Juror 8 argues that the noise of a passing train would have obscured the threat the second witness claimed to have overheard. Juror 5 changes his vote, as does Juror 11, who believes the defendant, had he truly killed his father, would not have returned to the crime scene several hours later to retrieve the murder weapon as it had already been cleaned of fingerprints. Juror 8 points out that people often say ""I'm going to kill you"" without literally meaning it.
Jurors 5, 6, and 8 further question the second witness's story. Juror 3 is infuriated, and after a verbal argument, tries to attack Juror 8, shouting ""I'll kill him!"". Juror 8 points out that this proves his point about the defendant's words. Jurors 2 and 6 change their votes; the jury is now evenly split.
Juror 4 doubts the defendant's alibi, based on the boy's inability to recall certain details. Juror 8 tests Juror 4's own memory. He is able to remember events from the previous week, with some difficulty. Jurors 2, 3, and 8 debate whether the defendant could have stabbed his much-taller father from a downward angle, eventually deciding it was physically possible, though awkward. Juror 5 points out that someone who knew how to use a switchblade would have stabbed underhand at an upwards angle.
Impatient to leave, Juror 7 changes his vote and is confronted by Juror 11; Juror 7 insists, albeit unconvincingly, that he thinks the defendant is not guilty. Jurors 1 and 12 also change their votes, leaving only three guilty votes. Juror 10 erupts in racially motivated vitriol. The rest of the jurors turn their backs to him and Juror 4 tells him to sit down and be quiet. Juror 4 declares that the woman who saw the killing from across the street stands as solid evidence. Juror 12 reverts back to a guilty vote.
Juror 9 realizes that the witness, coming from bed, would not have had time to put on her glasses in time to see the assault occur, making her story dubious. The remaining jurors, except Juror 3, change their vote to not guilty.
Juror 3 gives an increasingly tortured string of arguments, building on earlier remarks about his strained relationship with his own son. In a moment of rage, Juror 3 tears up a photograph of him and his son before breaking down sobbing. He mutters not guilty, making the vote unanimous. As the others leave, Juror 8 helps the distraught Juror 3 with his coat. The defendant is found not guilty off-screen and the jurors leave the courthouse. In a brief epilogue, Jurors 8 and 9 introduce each other for the first time by their names before parting.",12 Angry Men

The boy couldn't even remember a thing about the movie he just saw that night. And one of the juries could just say one or two things about the movie he saw 3 days ago.That's not a similar situation.

A superb cast with excellent writing were the main ingredient to produce this masterpiece.The constant tension between the jurors and how they present their arguments trying to convince one another whether the defendant is guilty or not allows the viewer to learn some points in negotiation. 1) Separate emotion and prejudice from the decision making. 2) Hold discussions or meetings at a time and place where everyone is able to fully commit to (Instead of rushing off to watch the ball game, or sweating in the hottest day of the year). 3) Speak to be understood, and not just heard.

Some insights such as 1) Removing personal emotions/ prejudice from the objective or problem at hand 2) Ensuring that all parties meet at a time and place that is suitable and conducive (not when someone has a ball game to run off to, or the hottest day of the year.) 3) Speaking to be understood and not just heard.

He is a really famous director. This is his first and best reviewed film. People may think this movie is slow because it is old and black and white. It is not. The film takes place in one room. I saw this movie when I was 12 and liked it. This movie is about an 18 year old boy who is on trial because people thought he murdered his dad. It is the hottest day of the summer. The main character played by Henry Fonda is the only character so far who says the boy is not guilty. This is a short review because there isn't a lot going on. Henry Fonda plays the least angriest person out of all the jurors. The second main character played by Lee J Cobb is the angriest person in the movie. Let's talk about the switch knife which people thought was the knife used by the boy that killed his father. The guy played by Henry Fonda shows he found one himself. That was my favorite scene in the movie. When Henry Fonda's character convinced everybody to say not guilty, Lee J Cobb was the last one to say not guilty. My favorite thing about the movie was Lee J Cobb's relationship with his kid. The movie ends with Henry Fonda walking out the door and saving a kid's life. A really good ending.",12 Angry Men

Considering that I was very excited to see it and had extremely high expectations, it's pretty amazing that there was no let-down whatsoever when I actually watched the movie.A teenager living in a slum is charged for the murder of his father, using a knife. Although Juror #8 convinces everyone by the end that the kid is innocent, there is tons of evidence stacked up against him. I was easily convinced that the kid was innocent, but I know several people who watched the movie from start to finish and still thought he was guilty. I love the movie and consider it one of my top five favorite movies, but I think it's a little unrealistic. I don't understand how Juror #3, who personally wants the kid to die, and Juror #10, who discriminates against slum people by nature, could be swayed to vote not guilty, since even my parents and some people in my English class couldn't be swayed.Despite that, I really love this movie.

1089,geber1,An Excellen Film that Uses Little to Say Much,10,18 December 2008,"With 12 Angry Men, director Sidney Lumet makes so much out of so little. All of the men are wearing white shirts and ties, and when we first see them they all appear to be as simple as their clothes; they make small talk before casting the first vote, and we make the mistake of feeling like we understand them. But as Henry challenges their decisions, we learn that they each have a complex set of beliefs and motivations.We soon learn that evidence is not the only thing that's influencing many of the juror's decisions. Some vote guilty because they don't trust teenagers, some do it because they don't trust the young man's ethnicity, which is never made clear (but racial stereotyping certainly is), some do it because it just ""feels"" right, and some do it to escape the boredom or oppressive heat. These factors, together with the evidence, make it seem obvious that the man truly did murder his father, but Juror No. 8 (Henry Fonda) refuses to let him die without being absolutely certain that he is in fact guilty.Fonda's character reminds the men of two very important things that they either forgot or didn't take into consideration. The first is that a young man's life is in their hands, and whatever conclusion they come to is going to profoundly affect him. Although this is never discussed, it's possible that none of the jurors have ever had to make such an important decision and are not used to taking the kind of precaution such a situation requires (in fact, Juror No. 12 appears to treat it like a routine board meeting). Fonda is fully cognizant of the severity and tries to get the others to feel the same way. He also reminds them that a guilt verdict must be made free of any doubt. According to American law, a man is innocent until proved guilty, but the men consider it to be the other way around. It is through close examination of the evidence that the men are able to reach a verdict clear of any doubt or outside influences.Of course, the road from small talk to their final verdict is not a smooth one, and never has there been so much drama in one single room. Although Lumet keeps them in the same room, which has no interesting features, for the great majority of the film, he manages to pull of some subtle yet incredible cinematic effects. In the beginning, the camera is placed towards the ceiling and we are looking down at the jurors, a visual metaphor for our mistaken feeling that they are simple men. Later, it is placed toward the floor and we now look up at them and perhaps even marvel at their complexity. Lumet has challenged our conception of the average man, showing us through camera and dialogue that he or she can indeed be very intricate.Lumet also uses different lenses to great effect. As the film progresses, he uses lenses with longer focal lengths to make the room seem smaller. The tension is greatly increased as the walls seem to close in on the men, and this can be seen as different metaphor: as Juror 8 dismisses the stereotypes and prejudices, the only thing left is the evidence.12 Angry Men is a masterpiece and can be the subject of endless analysis. It can be viewed from a political and a sociological perspective, and would be great for a prospective cinematographer to study. If nothing else, the acting and dialogue are superb and make for an entertaining experience.",12 Angry Men
1090,superdavey,Brilliant direction and performances,10,22 February 2019,"I saw 12 Angries for the 4th time last night. I knew every line and reaction and was still engrossed to the end. The are maybe a couple dozen movies I can say that about.To be honest, I think some of the dialog and a couple of the plot points are weak, but Lumet's direction keeps the movie moving seamlessly forward. All the actors are good, with Ed Begley, EG Marshall and Henry Fonda particularly so. It is Lee J. Cobb, however, that stands out for me. So powerful yet nuanced. Near the end, after Cobb recounts ""every single"" reason he thinks the kid is guilty, John Fiedler says ""You said we could throw out all the other evidence""
Cobb's reaction of bewilderment and frustration rang so true I have a hard time believing he was acting.A fun exercise is to figure out the juror you most identify with. For me it is Fonda. Thoughtful, respectful, balanced, and cautious. Sometimes to a fault.",12 Angry Men
1091,kothawade-amol,Search for the best male personality,9,10 August 2010,"""12 Angry Men"" is an awe inspiring movie resembling a play where 12 jury members are asked to determine a young man's fate. The condition that the young man must either be convicted guilty or not guilty is too harsh and made me dislike the plot. However, this movie, at least for me, is not about the decision or the trial but about the 12 unique male characters.All the 12 men have personalities we can relate to in our daily lives making this movie realistic. For the sake of classification, let's say there are 3 kinds of men - ""so called real men"" , ""Polite, theoretical/ intellectual but timid"" and ""cool, fun loving but careless.""The so called real men are arrogant. They are not at all flexible. They have fixed views and they don't want to change their views. They prefer going with their preconceived notions. They have special ways of behaviour. They represent style - the way they walk n talk. They have personalities which easily make any timid guy to follow them. Such dictatorial people may not make the best leaders but gets most attention for sure. They represent a very high male ego. It is interesting to see Juror no 10 disliked by other jury for his preconceived notions in one scene. His male ego gets hurt when Juror no 4 says ""Now sit down and don't open your mouth again."" His emotional break up is worth watching and so is Juror no. 3's. Difference between juror no. 10 and 3 is juror no 10 does not care for anyone's support when he expresses his views but Juror no. 3 accepts Juror no. 4's leadership. Such kind of men can influence by their personalities but are perceived as vain people.""Cool, fun loving but careless"" men may be the most appreciated by women but for this plot they are the ones who are least admired. Such self centered people are best for themselves but should have maturity to keep personal life separate from work. Juror no 7 belong to this category. Juror no. 12 also appear to be more n less carefree types.""Polite, theoretical/ intellectual but timid"" men are the products of our education system. They are taught to behave with manners, follow social rules and think in certain intellectual ways. They are the pillars for the well being of the society. If they are not there, the system wouldn't even work. They follow discipline. However, they appear weak and boring. Most of the men from the jury belong to this category. However, there are many shades. The timid but intellectual men (Juror no. 1,2,5,6,9,11 )are the ones who are necessary both to keep the best man appear best in relative terms and run the system smoothly. However, when it comes to intellectual, confident men, we have very few options left. Juror no. 8 is the most important character in the plot. However, as movie goes on, he appears manipulative. His guts are appreciable, but taking a stand, which appears neutral at the first instance but using it for self-glory later is not appreciable. Such men can only make winners in the society. However, I personally would not prefer to become such a manipulative winner. (Putting personal prejudices apart: P)Juror no 4 is an interesting character. He is combination of both characters - real man and intellectual man. He is definitely better than all other personalities but the most important thing is he does not seem to be interested in attracting attention for the sake of attaining it. He is not in the competition. Guess, that makes him the best one however (his apathy towards becoming best) making this search look pathetic.The whole discussion and the clashes among all these men are worth watching; making this movie a worth watching treat.",12 Angry Men
1092,michael-raring,"still good, but overrated",7,22 July 2010,"Yeah, I know, ""12 angry man"" is a classic. It deals with a topic that was and may still is very important. It was truly ahead of the times. Also the characters were very well portrayed and although the film is very minimalist it delivers the plot very well and it is worth watching, no doubt. But I think the movie is overrated. Its plot line is very very straight so that you know the end right when you start watching. There is no real turn, that blows you away. It is quite simple. Also I wasn't moved as much by this film, I wouldn't be thinking about it if I weren't writing this review right now. So don't get me wrong, I think the film is totally worth watching, but #9 on IMDb of all times? Don't agree..

I'd wager this is not the case, though. The extant the jury went to go from almost unanimous guilty from the start to unanimous not guilty boggles the mind when one considers how weak the alternate theories were against very strong evidence of guilt. And the last thing debated, the eyewitness's eyesight, which seemed to be the thing that mostly turned the tide, should not have been debated at all since the lady's eyesight was never a subject at trial.The burden of proof is on the prosecution and the defense need only find enough reasonable doubt equal in weight to the evidence of guilt for a not guilty verdict. But the doubt that the jury must find has to be reasonable. ""...but is it possible?"" is not enough, Fonda. It must be reasonable. The doubt found by the jury was no where near reasonable.

To put short, this film is one of the best ever made and rightfully deserves its position on IMDBs top 250 list. To be honest, there's not a lot that one can comment about the film. There are no special effects, dramatic monologues or defining scenes to discuss and really that's what makes this film the phenomenon that it is. It is quite easy to see where the film is going to go and how it is going to end early on but none of that really matters because excuse the sugary metaphor but it is the journey you embark on with the jurors, in particular Henry Fonda, that defines the film. The way in which each different aspect of the court case is re-evaluated is film heaven but also a hard hitter when reflecting on the seriousness that the film makes about judicial systems and the responsibility of juries to make thorough rational decisions. If you had told me before the film that it was as near as makes no difference one scene with 12 men conversing for 100 minutes (or whatever), i would have kindly asked you if we could watch Die Hard instead, but oh what an ignorant error that would have been. 12 Angry Men is magnificent.",12 Angry Men

Otherwise, this movie actually surprised my ideas, indeed. This movie is surprisingly brilliant, it is very simple but wonderful at the same time, it just shows how can a simple movie without any special effects can be turn to a real masterpiece. The whole cast is amazing, specially Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb which made this film even more incredible, thanks to their powerful performances. The characters are impressive, there is a wonderful job on that department, all jury's are different from each other, in personality and class terms, which in my opinion made a very good character extension. The dialog was genius, very original and creative. Filmography was beautiful, the camera focusing the juror's faces was really impressive with the black and white picture as well. What also impressed me was the impact that this all discussion between the 12 men can make a perfect impression of our society of today, even though this film was made in 1957.This is really an outstanding classic movie, which is really worth to see, and that I really wasn't expecting for its marvelous success.",12 Angry Men

This is a film where tension comes from personality conflict, dialogue and body language, not action; where the defendant has been glimpsed only in a single brief shot; where logic, emotion and prejudice struggle to control the field.

Watching every juror in the room exchanging the conversation really makes me feel like I was in that room with them, It's like watching them playing ping-pong that goes back and forth back and forth and it's getting more intense each time any one open up their mouths.

As the movie progresses, the story got a hold of you so tight that after some point you start thinking like a jury and become the 13th Angry Man who wants to solve this case. What wins over everything is a strong plot with a brilliantly written screenplay. It's not so easy to write a mystery drama occurring inside a single room and let the viewer picturing every details through dialogues, but full marks to Reginald Rose for keeping the screenplay so tight with minute details of each incident that everything comes so easy as if they are happening in front of the eyes . The direction is so perfect that you are convinced that the whole movie is shot in a single day, there could not have been a better story telling than this, where the plot demands it. What makes the movie more interesting is the director's approach to arrange long shots which are acted brilliantly by everyone. Henry Fonda stands out of the crowd with a calm and composed act and justified his role to the fullest. A special mention goes to the make up department which kept in check the sweating of each character, though not so much of an importance but that provides a feeling of continuity in the movie. One special mention of the bathroom scene where one of the jury flips the cigarette, which is executed flawlessly and you wonder how many takes it's gonna take to make that scene to perfection. Not everyday you watch a movie like 12 Angry Men and not everyday you get the satisfaction to call a movie ""A Masterpiece"", well, today is the day.

I suppose it's all been said already about this film....My number 2 favorite Film ever, after The Good, bad the ugly. Lee J Cobb I suppose was the next most important character and it seemed like a battle between him and Fonda. I think Fonda's coolest and classiest part was when he showed that even after Cobb had threatened to kill him and all the hostility Cobb showed him throughout, he still offered Cobbs coat at the end. He didn't bear a grudge, cool right to the end. Really this film was about how people from different back rounds and professions interact when placed on an equal footing.",12 Angry Men
1107,darrenrgregory,One of the most engaging and genuine films i've ever seen.,10,11 April 2012,"I can't praise this film highly enough.From the very beginning you are forced into the debate by the subtle camera work and superb acting. At various points throughout the film and used delicately the actor in focus is directed to speak into the camera, it has an engaging effect in which you feel yourself become part of the Jury. You feel the tension between characters as opinions begin to change.The characters themselves are so cleverly developed that even after small amount of dialogue you can see the cross section of society sitting around the table becoming apparent, a very ordinary group of men, ordinary in such a way that anyone watching this film would be able to identify with at least one of them, each one having a slight difference in attitude. There are no bad guys or good guys, nothing is forced. All you see is mostly people who initially believe they are right with their views.The film centres around the jury beginning to question the defence given to the accused. Initially it falls to just one juror played by Henry Fonda who is not happy to proceed with a verdict until it's been fully discussed, albeit to the annoyance of the the remaining jurors who are convinced and willing to give a guilty verdict. As the prosecution case is slowly pulled part and the views of the jurors alter, it's not just the case at hand which is affected but the general attitudes of each one of them, prejudice and insecurity is brought out into the open as the up bringing of the accused is discussed.There are no weak spots acting wise, everything falls into place, is delivered to perfection and blends seamlessly.

Cobb deserves an extra mention though for his performance in this film, it's truly outstanding.This film is a genuine masterpiece, a true cinema experience that should be watched by as many people as possible.10/10",12 Angry Men

My problem is that it is so perfect, so seamlessly polished, it is hard to appreciate the individual excellences.The acting is top notch. I believe that monologue acting is quite a bit simpler than real reactive ensemble acting. Most of what we see today is monologues pretending to be conversations. But in this film, we have utter mastery of throwing emotions. Once the air becomes filled with human essence, it is hard to not get soaked ourselves as the camera moves through the thick atmosphere. Yes, there are slight differences in how each actor projects (Fonda internally, Balsam completely on his skin...) but the ensemble presents one vision to the audience.The writing is snappy too. You can tell it was worked and worked and worried, going through several generations. It is easy to be mesmerized by this writing and acting, and miss the rare accomplishment of the camera-work. This camera is so fluid, you forget you are in one room. It moves from being a human observer, to being omniscient, to being a target. It is smart enough to seldom center on the element of most importance, so expands the field to all men.This is very hard. Very hard, to make the camera human.

I'm not some old guy reviewing based on nostalgia or anything like that.They really don't make movies like this anymore. There are no twists, there are no turns, there are no explosions, and there are no special effects. What you get here is a smart, dialogue driven tale about 12 men burdened with the fate of a young Hispanic man. Something you don't see too often these days is a brilliantly written script. 98% of this movie takes place in one room, and thus relies on character interaction and dialogue and nothing more. It reminds us that there is more to life than whats on the surface, something we often forget.It reminds me of a movie like Clerks. Obviously a completely different type of movie, but at its root is quite similar. Smart, subtle, and character-driven (and black & white which is kind of beside the point). Most everyone can identify with one of the jurors. The skeptic, the racist, the conformist, the indifferent. We all know people like this, and you'll likely find yourself identifying with one or more of the jurors.So many around my age would immediately dismiss this film because of its simplicity and because its understated. I feel quite sorry for them. The film is quite compelling and you really get sucked into the life of a juror in a murder trial.

1119,tommybone17,"One of the best, if not THE best, courtroom drama in the history of cinema.",10,7 June 2006,"Sidney Lumet's ""12 Angry Men"" is a film that would never appeal to me because of its old age and its black and white film, but once I started watching this, I couldn't help but get sucked in with everything unraveling in the jury room. There are no small characterization among the 12 jurors, with each one having a lot of resonance and importance to the story, something I found very well done thanks to Reginald Rose's script. Even though I think each of the 12 jurors are very well-characterized, the two that stood out in my mind are Juror #8 (played by Henry Fonda) and Juror #3 (played by Lee J. Cobb). Juror #8 is the main protagonist out of the 12, simply because he's the one who stood for the 18 year old Hispanic kid, who's convicted of murdering his father, from the very beginning. His determination and graceness carries throughout the film, and Henry Fonda played wonderfully in this role. Lee J. Cobb's Juror #3, the main antagonist of the film, is the definition of arrogance and ignorance. This is the film that should make Lee J. Cobb as one of the biggest defining actors in Hollywood history, and his performance as Juror #3 is very, very memorable. One of the big reasons why I didn't really enjoy watching ""black and white"" movies are that they feel too slow and have too much reliance on talking, but this one is an exception. Even though the movie is all talk, I found that the script is very, very well written and kept the tension going among the 12 jurors and its final outcome. Each character is distinctly different, with some similarities but also some differentiation, which makes each of the characters believable and relatable in one way or the other. The story, although strictly a courtroom drama, really gives a rather worldly aura within the interaction between the different jurors, since each juror has their own story to tell in relations to the conviction of the 18 year old Hispanic boy. Even though this is the only film I saw from Sidney Lumet, I can tell that if this is one of the movies considered classic, then I've missed out on others as well. He has done a very good job with keeping the story flowing and doesn't direct any jarring moments within the only place the jurors are in throughout the whole movie (the jury room). He kept the jury process interesting and engaging, something other courtroom drama didn't really do right. All in all, this should be the film that set the standard of courtroom drama. I don't think any film surpass ""12 Angry Men"" in that regard, so I think this should be on any serious film collector's collection. Sidney Lumet's masterpiece garners a 10/10 and is in my opinion the best courtroom drama ever filmed (unless I've missed out on others).",12 Angry Men

Bravo.One can only wonder what kind of control Lumet was able to exercise with this formidable cast. Fonda is his usually restrained self, but Cobb, who usually shouts in every role I can remember, has a genuine humanity that deepens with the unfolding of the story. I have to be honest, he's not my favorite of the era, but this role really redeems him in, my eyes. All the others put in solid performances (you'll see a lot of familiar faces if you watched any 60's TV).

In a well-crafted metaphor for the broader outline of society, the jury members must confront their prejudices in order to see that justice prevailsduring the movie you encounter with 2 side of judgment and try to judge with your LAW! its one of best dialogue driven movie you should Watch",12 Angry Men

I am writing this as a letter of apology for having this prejudice towards something I did not experience myself but judged it based solely on what society ""told"" me to think.These 96 minutes of dialog will make you think twice about more than just the film's story. I don't think that I have to mention that the story itself is so complex in its simplicity, that it can be seen as a timeless insight on one of the biggest flaws of society, modern or otherwise.I can't say anything more but I do urge you to see this film, regardless if you're 9 or 90.

The details of the trial and murder are slowly revealed as we go deeper into the plot.The whole film takes place in a room where the jurors are supposed to decide the boy's fate. The vote has to be unanimous for the verdict to be applied, but there is one man who is not convinced of the boy's guilt so he decides to try and persuade the other eleven who are certain he is guilty.The message of this film is clearly expressed: everyone sees things how they want to, how it suits them and the truth can be easily flawed. If you seek an example of how facts can be manipulated in one's favor, this drama is what you are looking for.The character development is one of the best I have seen so far. I believe Sidney Lumet tried and accomplished to include all types of personality in twelve men, ""angry"" being, more or less, the common trait they all manifest.

This film is the perfect example of why having the skill to direct an entire story, taking the time to rehearse and getting actors off page, can take a story confined to a tiny space and make it one of the top films of all time. There is room for special effects and action sequences but as long as directors take the time and put in the care to make quiet moments solid pieces of acting then even spectacle films can be critically acclaimed. Kevin Feige of Marvel has made it a point to cast great actors in superhero films even when the choice might have seemed unlikely. The reason is he knows great acting makes for a great film.

1153,karthickraja-14268,Should be in everyone's top ten list of greatest films of ALL TIME.....by Sydney Lumet,9,24 November 2015,"Films rarely get this uplifting and brilliant. I cannot think of the last time I was so intrigued by the flawless plot, dialogue and acting since 12 Angry Men. For such a simplistic story set in one jury room, it is surprising that Sidney Lumet can drain you of all your emotions and leave you on the edge of your seat with suspense, mystery, and some of the best acting your bound to ever see grace the silver screen!When a boy is on last day of trial for killing his father in the heat of domestic arguments, 12 jury men are forced to present a verdict in which if guilty, is the one way ticket to the electric chair for the boy. When the jury men decide to quickly end the discussion and raise their hands to find out who thinks the boy is guilty, only one jury man (Henry Fonda) doesn't put his hand up. Trial and Character revelations, doubts, and possibilities follow.So masterfully crafted is this film, that every time I watch it, only gets better. It includes some of the best character development I've ever seen. Sidney Lumet is an expert in this field and this is by far his greatest contribution to Hollywood history - one of the most important contributions to world cinema. However it was Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb who really made this film legendary, with their incredibly realistic performances. Casting was genius. And the dialogue was astoundingly riveting up until the brilliant finale. What really impressed me personally also was the camera angles and movements that made the film so suspenseful. Black and White made the film all the more powerful. And the music was minimal, which gave the film a more atmospheric experience, like you were their in the jury room with them - and you just feel that tension really built up as the movie proceeds.This inexpensive film, with such a simple setting had the world talking, the academy awards nominations rolling and Henry Fonda at his complete best form. I have rarely been so hypnotized by a film - 'Lawrence Of Arabia' and 'It's A Wonderful Life' are other ones that come to mind. This is a definitive viewing for anyone who loves film. It sums up everything I love about film. Everything from a technical point of view to superb acting and a simple yet complex character driven story, it's platinum and is most definitely one of the greatest cinematic achievements of all time - bar none!

1154,ClearyDealy,And you wonder why we hate seeing those Jury Duty letters!,6,23 January 2006,"It's hot, cramped, tedious and can last for several hours before a resolution is achieved...Now, take the life of a young man in your hands, 11 people ready to tear any of your ideas to shreds and you've become Juror #8 in Sidney Lumet's version of ""12 Angry Men"". To follow the seemingly apparent evidence and convict? Or question it, and unravel the many hidden layers concealing the possible truth? That is the conundrum thrust upon 12 ordinary men. Personifying our conscience and perhaps seeking an insurmountable solution to the case, Juror #8 sets forth excavating the grueling details presented. The prejudicial attitudes of the other jurors increase the complication of proving reasonable doubt, but eventually all but one succumb to logic. This in turn, creates a reversal of scenery as the wolf of the pack of 11 now stands in solitary, desperately clinging to his pride.An insightful, mentally stimulating, look into the emotionally charged process of a jury's deliberation before a verdict is handed down. A variety of cast ensures the perfect mixture of arrogance and ridicule spread into the atmosphere creating tension from the get-go. Although some characters are one dimensional; foregoing human reasoning to sustain their own beliefs, the story still connects closely enough to correlate with the audience. It is as if a fountain of human emotion and beliefs was divided to reveal each trait in man and allow a presentation of each in regard to one topic. This produces, not so much a humanly conversation between equals, but a decisive battle amongst human characteristics. Overall, this creates a well designed and intricate plot with which to absorb the viewer. A commendable aspect of this film is that because of a wide coverage of emotion, almost everyone can find a character with whom they share a close relation or system of beliefs, thereby making it a unique and appealing conversion when a point of view is presented to that specific juror. This film also encourages abstract thought which is a concept I find appealing because it allows one to see outside the norms of society and comprise their own solutions based not only on what they've been told, but the logic behind it.",12 Angry Men

For example, juror number 3 who wants the kid to be guilty just because he is emotionally affected by what his son done to him, juror number 7 who just agrees with the majority because he doesn't care and want to leave early, or juror number 9 who insists that the old man lied when he gave his witness just because he want to be known, to feel that he is something, it is the same thing that he feels, that no one knows him, they were going to start while he was in toilet because no one realize that he wasn't there, and in the last scene he asked juror number 8 about his name, and told him his name too, so at least 1 person will know him.The most important thing is the idea this movie is trying to tell us, that we must do what is right, whether we are alone or we have everyone with us, we just have to do the right thing no matter what will happen, even if we will be humiliated, or even if we will be attacked by everyone, we must stuck to the right thing.Another thing must be mentioned, Lee J.Cobb is a just amazing, whenever the camera is on him he steals the whole scene.Only one thing I don't like about this movie, the arguments of those who thought the kid was guilty are not strong enough, I wish they were better, that would surely have made this movie more amazing.",12 Angry Men

This is clearly seen at approximately 1:46 in the movie when juror 11 talks to juror 3 that I will type the exact conversation for better influence down below:Juror 11: He's right, that's not an answer. What kind of a man are you? You have sat here and voted guilty with everyone else because there are some baseball tickets burning a hole in your pocket. And now you've changed your vote because you say you are sick of all the talking here?Juror 3: Ah listen, buddy...Juror 11: Who tells you that you have the right to play like this with a man's life? Don't you care...Juror 3: Now wait a minute. You can't talk like that to me!Juror 11: I can talk like that to you. If you want to vote ""not guilty"" then do it because you are convinced the man is not guilty not because you've had enough. And if you think he is guilty then vote that way. Don't you have the guts to do what you think is right?Another lesson from this movie is always to put yourself in the shoes of someone you are trying to judge. Which I believe is shown at roughly 1:12 in the movie when juror 8 talks to juror 4 about his weekly schedule and asks about a few nights back when he had seen a movie and that he can't remember the plot or even the name of that movie. And the sound of something breaking inside juror 4 is heard when a bead of cold sweat runs down his forehead.Another thing that was worthy of attention in this film was the fan that didn't work. While most of the men in the jury room were hot and complaining about the warmth of the room and one of them saying this is gonna be the hottest day of the year (and not likely to change). And when it gets dark and they have to turn on the lights, they discover that now the fan actually works. I think these two change of situations are two main ways to look at the whole shape of the movie. The change in the weather (which no one, not even the weather bureau, could predict) symbolizes the whole change in the overall vote of the jurors. And the whole ""fan situation"" is trying to tell that some light shed on a problem, can change everything.",12 Angry Men

While I can enjoy the experience of watching the film, I've come to the rather unpopular opinion that this is not a great film. 12 Angry men works far better as a stage play, than a movie. As a film, it's quit uninspired and lacking emotion. The dialogue being as uninteresting as your least favorite math class, this is only accentuated by the fact that this film attempts to carry itself on dialogue and performance. Another problem comes right from the name itself; 12. The 12 angry men in the film are mostly indiscernible from each other, excluding a select few. While on stage the characters can show a lot of complexity with each actor playing off of each others emotions and bringing something new to performances each night, the film is lacking in character development.",12 Angry Men
1162,alaakhedhiri,High tension without any action,9,12 July 2017,"This the first movie that made me want to write a review. This movie proves that you don't need guns,explosions,and action set pieces to keep the viewer on the tip of their seats . The tension in that small room with 12 amazing , very different characters ; each with his own different point of view. I like how in the beginning they show every character entering the room each doing their usual business, small chats it makes the characters feel real and authentic and the situation like everyday situation. Then the anime tension begins argument that feel like fights, people changing their votes and rechanging their votes guilty not guilty..... Every argument felt like a fight Every vote felt like a major turning point in the plot . And I really like the ending scene it really makes you feel you're in there with them. One of the best ending scenes.",12 Angry Men

1166,hemreyyy,Guilty for being impressive,8,9 January 2021,"The whole movie takes place in the jury room so if you want to see some action scenes or you don't like psychologia you may not like the movie.
The movie begins after a court and tells the story of a jury of 12 men who need to decide if the kid is guilty or not. There is a murder which a man was stabbed in the chest and the dead man's son is the biggest suspect. When they arrive at the room they vote the kid as guilty or not guilty. The votes are eleven to one. However, it has to be twelve to nothing for deciding what is going to happen to the kid. Therefore, the kid won't execute because of the one not guilty vote. They start to argue the details. The jury who voted as not guilty begins to refute the testimony of the witnesses because there are some discrepancy in what the witnesses said. After that he tries to convince the other juries but not everyone is easy to convince.
This movie can dispel the prejudice about old movies especially black and white ones. Brilliant performances all around. We can see how psychological situations affect people on their behaviour. Some of the juries don't even have an idea, they just join the majority. The impassive manners of these juries was acted well. Beside of these, for me it is a good thing that the names are not said. It could cause chaos.

I'm not going to go into the plot or storyline of this movie other to say it's about a jury deliberation in a murder trial. The premise for the this movie is O.K. but some of the script seems excessive or down right silly; take for example the man who is really upset with his son. He's mad with his own son so he's going to convict this other young man for murder???????? Awwww, but wait; Henry Fonda is here to comfort the guy and to get him to do the right thing. What B.S. Also take a look at the dummy that wants to go to the baseball game. Who acts like this in real life? Now maybe he does want to go to the game and is willing to vote with the majority so he can get going but this would be called a SECRET AGENDA with the emphasis on SECRET.

1170,magentaheart,A slice of life,9,13 November 2017,"Foretold that 12 Angry Men involved twelve men sitting in a room and debating for an hour, I expected it to be mundane and tedious to watch. Contrary to my expectations, the movie was filled with tension and mystery, making it ninety-six minutes of excitement for viewers. The power of this movie lies in its ability to relate to a wide audience, as decision-making within a group that is coupled with conflict is a common sight for all. The negotiations were inefficient and disorganised, much like many that happen in reality. Despite this, the movie offers a slice of life as it mimics reality. It scares me slightly to believe that in a democracy, the fate of a man's life can lie in the hands of untrained individuals. Thankfully, in the movie, there were individuals who were not hasty and who bothered to patiently explore the issue tediously, with a satisfying ending for viewers – a 'not guilty' verdict.",12 Angry Men

It truly inspired me that one man standing his ground in a room full of hostile and differing opinions led to a completely different outcome from what someone would expect. There were a few key factors in the room that happened, allowing the swing from a 'guilty' verdict, to a 'not guilty' verdict. The key moment, that was vital, was not Juror 8 voting 'not guilty', I believe, but when he proposed a secret ballot from which he abstain from voting and will agree to change his vote if everybody else voted 'not guilty'. As it turns out, Juror 9 voted 'not guilty' as he was curious over what Juror 8 had to say, and believe it was worth the merit for discussion. Juror 8, as it turns out, has gained the interest of Juror 9, and the rest of the jurors had to listen to his argument as they had all agreed before.

1180,huichyisin,12 Angry Men's review,9,16 April 2018,"""Twelve Angry Men"" was one of the best movies I have watched. Even though it was filmed almost half a century ago, the movie was extremely engaging and constantly put its audience in suspense. The movie is about how 12 American jurors came together to decide whether Rican, a teenager was guilty of murdering his abusive father. The rule of the court was that if that there is a reasonable doubt, the boy would be not ""guilty"". At the beginning, Juror 8 was all alone in believing that the boy may not be guilty. The story then progresses when Juror 8 starts to use different tactics to win over the other Jurors. Personally, I was constantly awed and amazed by Juror 8's charisma and clever techniques. It was highly satisfying when Juror 8 were able to find ""flaws"" in seemingly impeccable concrete evidence, turning tables around. For instance, he re-enacted the testimony of the old man and proved that given the old man's walking speed, it is not possible for him to witness the boy running off. The movie was also highly captivating because all 12 actors were able to portray each juror and their unique personality very well, making the story highly realistic. For example, both Juror 8's charismatic personality and Juror 3 emotional and hostile personality were well played by the actors. Hence, even though the setting was simple, the story line and actors made this movie a classic. Furthermore, when complemented with Fisher ""Getting to Yes"" book, the negotiation techniques used by Juror 8 could be seen to still be highly applicable in today's world.",12 Angry Men

In the film, 12 Angry Men, we get to witness a heated scene that takes place mainly in a courtroom with a jury of 12 men. Throughout the movie, these 12 jurors deliberate and negotiate the acquittal of a defendant, an 18-year-old male who allegedly stabbed his father to death. In this negotiation, each juror has to make a choice between two options of accepting the current outcome of being ""guilty"" or join the opposing group of being ""not guilty"". In this case, some of the jurors made use of positional and principled negotiation, as discuss in the book Getting to YES by Roger Fisher, effectively to persuade the other parties. In the book, Fisher raised several problems that most negotiations face and then goes on to suggests effective solutions to overcome them. In this movie review, there are parallel between the observed negotiations made in the movie and concepts of principled negotiations discussed in the book. To sum up, 12 Angry Men is a brilliant movie that showcases a common negotiation situation that takes place in a courtroom. Particularly, I will like to applaud Juror 8, played by Henry Fonda, for being a skilled negotiator where he made use of skilful negotiation techniques mentioned in Getting to YES to change the outcome of the case.",12 Angry Men

The themes explored in the movie such as negotiations and human morality has been discussed well and provides the viewer with greater insights on how merely shouting out your opinion will not change how others view a problem. I feel that there was much to be learned from this extremely insightful movie, lessons which can be put into practice in this day and age when we talk to others.

Although most of us are rarely confronted with such a huge decision between life and death of another as in the movie, one thing is certain - each and every one of us makes decisions daily that would have an impact on ourselves and others. Like the 12 men, each one of us has a character that is different from another - with some being more assertive than others. The movie has helped me visualised how we often look like (foolish at times) when we are ""arguing to win"" and how things can be managed better ways than just arguing with our position! This movie is like a mirror image of my interaction with others at times and it is certainly a good reminder to move towards change :)",12 Angry Men
1209,clarissaho,Insights from the movie,7,3 April 2019,"The movie, though dated, is very much relevant to today's society. I would like to highlight a particular scene in the movie which resonated with me. From the movie, it can be seen that No.8 came to the discussion with an open mind and was keen on exploring the possibility of the alternative option that the boy could be innocent, while the rest were rather narrow minded and were bent on convicting the boy as guilty due to their preconceived judgement. Due to such differing views, it was difficult for the rest of the jurors to accept even the slightest possibility that the child could be innocent in the beginning. From this, it shows how people come into the negotiation with preconceived notion which locks them into their positional argument. Hence, I do think it is important to consciously detach oneself from the problem, and clearly communicate to the opposing party that the interest at hand is to target the issue instead of each other.
There are many other lessons that can be learnt from this movie. Highly encourage one to watch it!",12 Angry Men
1210,faithmunme,Simplicity At Its Best,10,4 April 2019,"12 Angry Men is a courtroom drama premised on twelve jurors who have to reach a unanimous decision on a murder case: if the suspect is guilty or not guilty. This premise and its plot resolution was set to be simple and straightforward from the very start. However, Lumet was able to dive into such detail and themes with so little to start with.One of the film's merits is how the jurors progress from argument to argument seamlessly. The techniques in negotiation presented drove the argument and plot. As Juror 8 negotiated for alternative perspectives, they took another look at the evidence. They revealed the ambiguity in the evidence, leading to reasonable doubt in the decision to be guilty. One such technique of negotiation is the use of objective criteria which involves pulling the criteria away from each individual's opinions, setting the negotiation to be objective and logically sound. This was especially suitable as the negotiation was targeted at Juror 4 who had established himself as a logical man. His vote for guilty was on the basis that the female witness's testimony was ""unshakeable"", in which other jurors agreed as well. This set the foundation for the objective criteria: the woman saw the crime happen, and there was no doubt about the testimony's accuracy. Eventually, Juror 9 noticed the marks on her nose made only by eye-glasses, pointing out that the woman had questionable eyesight. This was an undeniable situation as Juror 4 himself wore glasses, and acknowledged this fact as well. The woman's eyesight proved to be reasonably doubtful, making her testimony inaccurate. Consequently, he was negotiated into voting for acquittal. This also proved to be an important technique, as it increased the votes for acquittal, eleven to one. The principle revealed crucial details, as it was not a fight for dominance, but rather a joint search to find proof based on the objective criteria.",12 Angry Men

When 11 of them thought it was an easy decision to make, there was also effort from Juror 8 (Henry Fonda) to reveal what was really happened with the case and save a boy's life form death sentence. This film shows what logic can do to break prejudice and how a single decision can decide on a boy's life.Set of the place is one of the most important parts of a film. 12 Angry Men is unique because it only has one set of place located in the juror's room. But, if we thought this film will be boring because only has one set of place, we must be terribly wrong. Sidney Lumet has successfully directed the film with intense argument and interesting interaction between the jurors without forgetting ""the simpleness"" itself. All of the actors successfully drive their emotional expression towards the discussion. The dialogue is brilliant, genius, and remarkable, it makes all of the characters have their own signature and characteristics. The most important thing is this film didn't tell us who is the real murderer of the case. But only to decide whether the boy is guilty or not.This is such a masterpiece from Sidney Lumet, the main idea of the movie is to decide someone's life.

1234,simonjiajun,The Virtues and Shortcomings of Negotiation in the 12 Angry Men,10,25 October 2019,"In the 1954 film, 12 Angry Men, twelve jurors are tasked to decide the conviction or acquittal of an 18-year-old boy on trial for murdering his father. They are instructed to discuss the case on the basis of reasonable doubt and arrive at a unanimous verdict. While all but one juror - Juror 8 - are convinced that the boy is guilty at the beginning of the film, they eventually reach a consentient decision of ""not guilty"" at the end after an extensive deliberative process. In this movie review, I will be discussing the insights on negotiation that I have gained from the movie, with reference to the book Getting to Yes: Negotiating an agreement without giving in by Fisher, Ury, and Patton (2012).The jury quickly runs into the folly of locking themselves into their initial positions on the case when they echo Juror 7's call for a vote to be taken at the outset of their meeting. The situation took a turn for the worse when the foreman decides to implement an open ballot where the jurors indicate their votes by a show of hands - a voting method that has been shown to trigger the ""show-of-hands syndrome"" and discourage honest and equitable voting (Robbins, 2007). The phenomenon is a likely explanation behind Juror 2 and 6's inability to justify their vote, which seems to suggest that they might have merely conformed to the majority without much consideration for the rationale behind their decisions. This sets the stage for their arguing over positions, which Fisher identifies as one of the most common mistakes in negotiation (p. 4). Arguing over positions does not satisfy the fundamental criteria of bringing about a wise agreement in an efficient and amicable manner (ibid.) since the more clearly people define their positions, the more they commit to it and the harder it is for them to change their position (p. 4 - 5) - due in part to their newfound interest in ""saving face"" by ensuring the consistency of their subsequent actions with their initial positions (p. 8). This obstinate insistence on one's position is embodied in Juror 7's melodramatic response to a position that is opposed to his own: ""you couldn't change my mind if you talked for a hundred years"". In order to arrive at a wise solution, the jury should instead focus on interests, and not positions (p. 23). Sebenius defines positions as ""one party's stands on the issue"" while interests are ""underlying concerns that would be affected by the resolution"" (p. 91, 2001). Hence, instead of digging themselves into their positions, the jurors should look past the superficiality of their positional differences and examine their underlying interests by focusing on reconciling different interests and advancing their shared interest (p. 11), which is to bring justice to the case.An interesting aspect of the negotiation is that while all jurors share the same Best Alternatives to a Negotiated Agreement (BATNA) - concluding with a hung jury - the implications of a failed negotiation are vastly different between those for and against a guilty verdict. Research has shown that approximately half of the hung jury cases result in an acquittal of the defendant (Kalven & Zeisel, 1966). However, with all the eyewitness testimonies and physical evidence against him, it is most likely that the boy would be convicted by the subsequent jury in the event of a hung jury. Thus, at the start of the negotiation, the jurors who firmly believes that the boy was guilty - such as Jurors 3 and 9 - have a good BATNA, while Juror 8, who believes that the boy may be innocent, has a bad BATNA. Consequently, the jurors who were in favour of a guilty verdict had a stronger negotiating power than Juror 8, as the relative negotiating power of two parties is predominantly determined by how attractive to each is the option of walking away from the negotiation (p. 52). This advantage in negotiating power is manifested in Juror 3's exclamation of his readiness to declare a hung jury. However, Juror 8 cleverly develops his BATNA throughout the discussion, which is the most effective way to deal with a negotiator who is apparently more powerful than himself (p. 54). At the very end of the discussion, Juror 8 even manages to erode Juror 3's confidence in his own BATNA (p. 53) by invoking his conscience and appealing to his underlying interest in doing what is just.A handful of the jurors also fail to separate the people from the problem, such as when Juror 3 baselessly accuses Juror 5, who has lived in a slum all his life, of changing his vote out of personal sympathy for the teenage boy, who had similarly grown up in a slum. At one point, even the usually clear-headed and composed Juror 8 let his righteous indignation get the better of him and falls prey to the ad hominem fallacy (Yap, 2013) when he momentarily diverges from the discussion, condemns Juror 3 for being a sadist, and questions his motive for wanting to see the boy executed. These exemplify Fisher's claim that people tend to draw speculative inferences about the intentions and attitudes of others in an almost reflexive manner (p. 22), which causes them to be ""defensive and reactive"" while overlooking the legitimacy of the others' interests (p. 40). Interestingly, both confrontations are successfully mediated by Juror 10, who brings the discussion back to the substantive issue by highlighting that they should not make the discussion ""a personal thing"", as it is precisely the fact that they have ""nothing to gain or lose by the verdict"" which makes them competent jurors. By disentangling the substantive problem from the ""people problem"", the jury is better able to target the problem instead of the people (ibid.), making it easier for them to see one another as partners working side-by-side to satisfy their collective interest (p. 41).A large part of Juror 8's success in convincing the other jurors may be attributed to his use of objective criteria that are independent of either side's will, which facilitated the exploration of possible standards and solutions (p. 46). Juror 4 sets the scene for negotiating with objective criteria by proposing that they should ""discuss the facts"", effectively bringing the group to agree on truth and rationality as the appropriate standards on which to base their decision. Throughout the discussion, Juror 8 plays his part by remaining ""open to reason but closed to threats"" (p. 43). He is receptive to reasoned persuasion by objective facts (p. 59) as he is aware of the possible lapses in his knowledge and the potential shortcomings of his arguments. Thus, he routinely invites the other jurors to participate in re-enacting the crime scene and in evaluating the reliability of the evidence (p. 18), which is useful in turning criticism from his opponents into a key ingredient of convincing the others of his views (p. 56). He is also able to remain unphased and steadfast in the face of threats and personal attacks from the more aggressive jurors and never succumbs to pressure. For instance, when Juror 10 and 3 lash out Juror 8, he calmly diffuses the tension by asking questions and employing strategic pauses (ibid.).Juror 8's masterful application of negotiation jujitsu, which revolves around skilful sidestepping one's opponent's attack while deflecting it against the problem (p. 55), is also key to his success. Towards the end of the discussion, Juror 3 persists in his refusal to negotiate based on principle and confronts Juror 8 with the threat: ""I will kill you!"" Instead of defending himself or responding in kind through physical retaliation or counterthreats, Juror 8 comes back with a rhetorical question: ""you don't actually mean you'll kill me, do you?"" This enables Juror 8 to successfully recast the threat as an attack on the problem (p. 56) by turning it into ammunition for his earlier assertion that the phrase has largely been considered inane due to its repeated use in everyday conversations as a common expression of anger. Not only does this manoeuvre give vent to Juror 3's frustration (ibid.) while simultaneously taking the power out of his threat, it also increases the persuasiveness of Juror 8's argument and gets the others to reconsider the relevance of the eyewitness testimony. Juror 8 also demonstrates his strategic use of questions, instead of statements, to challenge his opponents and lead them to confront the problem (ibid.) when he exposes an incongruity between Juror 10's choice to believe the testimony of a non-white witness and his self-professed distrust towards people of colour with the question: ""how come you believe her? She is just one of them too, isn't she?""In conclusion, I consider 12 Angry Men to be one of the greatest cinematic exhibitions of group psychology within a deliberative assembly and a textbook example of principled negotiation. The movie is also perfectly complemented by the book Getting to Yes: Negotiating an agreement without giving in (Fisher et al., 2012). Being able to watch the negotiation techniques play out in the movie has greatly enhanced my understanding of the theories expounded in the book and helped me realise the usefulness and importance of good negotiation skills.",12 Angry Men

By watching their struggles in forming consensus, it shone light on the process of negotiations. The movie, primarily driven by the emotions of the jurors exhibit characteristics that impede the course of negotiations. Be it for dramatic effect, the jurors seem to have difficulties separating people from the problem on several occasions, with their emotions overwhelming them. The acting in 12 angry men is terrific, with the men portraying the true and loaded emotions that occur when there are disagreements. There are many lessons to be learnt from the negotiations process. For instance, Juror 10's underlying prejudice and preconceived notions can be observed when he said that slums were breeding grounds for criminals and were 'dirty'. Disapproval of his prejudiced views was clear as the other jurors turned their backs against him and disregarded his opinions, reminding him not to let it cloud his judgement.

1239,czixuan,Very educative,8,12 November 2019,"The jurors who failed to be good listeners are portrayed as unreasonable and illogical in the film. From a third person perspective, it is easy for us to see that some of the jurors are clearly affected by their own personal emotions in the film. Juror 3, who still voted for guilty in the last round, had a rebellious son, and he could not help but to relate to his son as the case was about a son murdering his own father. Due to the strong disappointment he had on his son, juror 3 was very firm about the fact that the son was guilty as he adapted the case to his personal experience. Personal experience could be useful when it comes to logical thinking, but should not be referred to if personal emotions were to be brought in as well. By taking the matter too personal, it prevents the negotiators from looking at the matter objectively, which is crucial during a negotiation. Furthermore, negotiators who are affected by personal emotions tend to feel uncomfortable when facing doubts from the opposite position. Negotiators need to be clear that questioning any claim that anyone has made is vital for purely clarification purposes.",12 Angry Men
1240,flamehawk-40572,A Masterclass in Negotiation for all,8,12 November 2019,"12 Angry Men is a 1957 courtroom drama film telling the story of 12 jurors deliberating over the guilt of the 18-year-old defendant, based on the context of reasonable doubt. The film itself serves as an excellent testament to the power of negotiation, exploring a plethora of techniques in building consensus and how they can be used to overcome the difficulties that arise in this process of discussion. The setting is the perfect stage for negotiation, as by virtue of them being in a jury, none of them know each other and none of them have personal stakes in the discussion, making the ensuing discussion a battle of logic, wit and delivery. The film intentionally sets itself up in a manner to elicit introspective thought from its audience by not revealing the names of any of the characters until the exchange of dialogue at the end of the film, pushing the audience towards self-evaluation with regard to the traits displayed on screen.
The premise of the film places the fate of the defendant in the hands of the jury, a death sentence hanging over his head. The jury has been instructed to deliver a unanimous verdict, denying them the luxury of agreeing to disagree. While initially there is a near complete vote in favour of the defendant's guilt, by the end there is a consensus of the inverse, following discussions that span the length of the film. This begins with Juror 8 being the only one arguing for the defendant's innocence, setting in motion events that lead to a unanimous vote to acquit the defendant. Juror 8 is framed as our protagonist, with Juror 3 as our antagonist, and the major learning points lie in the differences between the two.
At face value, one might imagine that Juror 3 is the superior negotiator between the two. He's confident of his points, quick to refute counter-arguments and does not back down even in the face of a strong point made against him. This is in stark contrast to the far meeker Juror 8, who appears to not only seldom refute the points of the other jurors, but even comes across uncertain of his own position. His foil, Juror 3, utilizes what Fisher and Ury define in their book ""Getting to Yes"" as Hard Positional Bargaining. His ultimate goal at the end of the discussion is victory, his is distrustful of others and treats them as adversaries and is both rooted in his position and demanding in this battle of wills. With this frame set up, it would be easy to determine that Juror 8 uses the opposite approach with his gentler personality, a Soft Positional Bargaining, seeking agreement, trusting others and treating the other negotiator as friends. But this is not quite what he is actually doing, and therein lies the first hidden strength of Juror 8. What he does over the course of the film falls is change the rules of the negotiation. From the beginning, he avoids coming across as confrontational by conceding that he might not be sure if the boy is truly guilty or not. In a regular setting this might seem like argumentative suicide, but in the jury setting, this is an excellent framing tool. All jurors have the civic responsibility to ensure to the best of their ability that the verdict carried out is just. When the negotiations began, all of them were defensive against the disagreement and prepared to refute him, but in expressing that ""I don't know whether I believe it or not, maybe I don't."", he changes the game such that it invites further deliberation from all parties, rather than drawing battle lines between two opposing positions. This is made possible as it is necessary to convince others that your mind can change in order to change their minds. By pushing away from the idea of bargaining for positions, he not only drives the other jurors to be more open to discussion, but also to make a wiser, less hasty decision over the life of another.
Juror 8 is also careful in his discussions not to yield to pressure. It would have been easy at the start for someone to give in to peer pressure simply due to an overwhelming majority against him, but he chooses not to. Holding fast to his interests, or in this case the interest of fairness and justice, was the first step in swaying the minds of the other Jurors. He utilizes the pressure to his advantage as ""Under the pressure of a forthcoming negotiation, your critical sense is likely to be sharper."" (Fisher & Ury, 32) and ensures that his points are all rooted in logic. This is unlike figures such as Juror 7, who succumbed both to personal interest and pressure of time when he switched his stance due to his urgency to attend the baseball game. Any insistence he puts forward in this setting was unconvincing and he additional managed to earn the disdain of the other Jurors for his lack of dedication to the topic. Juror 7 reveals in his actions a lack of objectivity which costs him his credibility, a trait which we will later see repeated with Juror 3. On the inverse, Juror 8 constantly takes action to make sure that not only he, but every other Juror is as objective as possible, reminding them that their role in the Jury might cause an innocent boy his life. Once again he changes the rules of the game, bringing them not to some other form of discussion, but rather realigning a discussion that initiated on a note influenced by personal factors with its intended execution. Doing so reinforces his credibility, as the other jurors see his points not as baseless argument, but spoken and driven by his responsibility to fulfilling his civic role to its upmost. This then pushes them to approach the discussion with the same attitude, one that in driven by justice and resolution rather than positions and confrontation.
By the end of the negotiations, Juror 3 reveals a fatal flaw in his argument, and that is his skewed vision towards the subject matter of the discussion. As he began to lose ground, his arguments became increasingly desperate and unconvincing. He ultimately reveals that his desperation to see the defendant be found guilty is driven by his strained relationship with his son, something that had been alluded to throughout the film. This reflects that his arguments while largely logical, were not driven by objective criteria. This introduction of personal stakes is an immediately penalizable point in the jury setting, and suggests that from the start he had already made up his mind without likely having truly considered all the facts. He was obsessed with what James Sebenius describes as ""believing your own line"", or rather, placing all his focus upon defending his position that he would disregard otherwise convincing points and arguments. His arguments thus took a form more akin to stating what he would and would not accept. Such an approach is costly in an argument as it inclines you against even the most logical statements. Refusal to acknowledge a reasonable argument makes an individual come across as unreasonable and Juror 3 is guilty of that time and time again.
The success of Juror 8 in convincing the others of his beliefs was fundamentally to acknowledge that he could not change their minds at all. Rather, the only person who can change a person's mind is themselves and he reframed the rules of the game to facilitate that. He had the upmost of respect for the views of the other Jurors, readily conceding when to them good points of arguments they had made, seeing them as part of the thought process. He displayed great awareness that simply because you disagree with a conclusion does not necessarily mean that you disagree with every thought that brought them there. While Juror 3 actively tried to pull the others to his side, Juror 8 pushed the others to re-evaluate the facts and then pick a side of their own. This is in no way implying that he does not make arguments to support his case, but rather he presents it as perspective and evidence to be considered as opposed to an undeniable truth. Even without a direct, relentless adversary like Juror 3, Juror 8 would have quite possibly brought the others to the same conclusion and in this context Juror 3 lost the war of attrition to Juror 8 by his own hand, gradually destroying his own credibility and ultimately dissuading the others of his cause.
These points, among many others, are among the reasons why 12 Angry Men is regarded as one of the most acclaimed courtroom dramas of all time, being seen by even the Library of Congress as worth of the National Film Registry for being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"". It was and continues to be a paragon of the principles of good negotiation from which we can all learn.",12 Angry Men
1241,m_rabiul,A perfect classic!,10,10 September 2015,"12 Angry Men is a deeply engrossing crime drama shot almost entirely in a claustrophobic utilitarian jury room which shows how one person with a conscience and critical thinking ability can make a difference to this society while also criticises how we are often biased by prejudice, bigotry, and conceit in making our decisions. This powerful film is a deep examination of human psychology which explains how we often judge an incident based on our own perceptual biases, close mindedness and own experience rather than the facts produced from that incident. A Hispanic teenage boy, born and raised in a slum, was accused of killing his father and was in trial. There were two concrete pieces of evidences which were enough to put the boy in the electric chair. But the final decision has to come from the juries and so they retired to the jury room after the judge asked them to come up with their verdict. It looked like an open and shut case until one juror (juror 8) vetoed and wanted to go through the facts again. Eleven members of the jury did not think otherwise and tried to convince him that he was wrong. Juror 8 did not have any concrete proof of otherwise but he raised his concern about the authenticity of the facts and incidents that has been produced during the case. Slowly, through his power of logic, patience and negotiation, he inspired the other juries to look into the facts from a fresh and different perspective. In fact he leaded them with some insights which seemed impossible to comprehend to the others. Inspired by his insights some of them started to delve into the facts, came out of their stereotypical mentalities, started to ask the right questions and finally came out with some startling perspectives which made their own earlier statements doubtful. The colour and pace of this black & white film came from the cohesive storyline and the arguments and counter arguments presented by the juries. This is a drama where the characters flourished in their respective roles to their fullest extent and likewise this is a thriller where the excitement came through sharp arguments. The film never shows whether the accused is guilty or innocent, neither does it draw its curtains on finding the murderer. It does not show any arguments between lawyers, it does not even give away the names of all the juries. Even though the plot is centred around a murder, the concept is centred around unravelling the psychology of human decision making. Perhaps, these are the reasons why this film is so different from any other court room dramas I have ever seen. A perfect classic!",12 Angry Men

The other reason why this movie stands out i feel is that one is never bored or lost track of the plot even once during the whole movie in spite of most of it being shot in a single room.

We feel the discomfort of Henry Fonda as the other characters belittle and mock how he can see any reasonable doubt in the case. But we also share his victories and the enthusiasm as he proceeds to refute or add doubt to the arguments for guilty and are captivated and draw in as other jurors begin to see doubt in the proceedings.The audience can also see the arguments for guilty and wonder if Fonda's character is correct in saying that he doubts. Yet they also feel the shame of the characters as he disproves that a previously sound theory is iron tight, joining his side as members of the jury do.On top of this they are wonderfully woven in human elements such as the misconceptions that influence people and the growing tension between different characters. This is brought to life even more by the amazing performances, Fonda, Lee J Cobb and Joseph Sweeney are of particular note.I started watching this film on a bored relaxed laying about day but by the end i was on the edge of the seat with my hands on my knees feeling more tense than a politician on results day.How a film should be made.

It is a movie that I love and never tire of watching.You forget, as you watch the movie, that pretty much the entire movie takes place in one room. Movies today, actors today, would not be able to maintain the level of suspense that this movie created and hold your attention for the entire hour and 36 minutes. It starts off slowly, and you become part of the jury stuck in that ""jury room"", frustrated as one man holds out because ""he is not sure"". Henry Fonda gives an amazing performance as the one-man holdout but all the actors give tour de force performances, and you sit mesmerized as one by one they are all converted. But it is Fonda and Lee J Cobbs, as they fight for the hearts and minds of the other jurors that keeps the tension going.

1278,Mostafizur_Rahman,Simply Best,10,15 September 2020,"Twelve Angry Men helps residents to remember their inborn obligations to genuinely comprehend each other all together for the American vote-based system to work adequately and reasonably. The film presents a jury of twelve men that must arrive at a consistent choice with respect to a first-degree murder preliminary of an 18-year-elderly person from the slums. Every attendant genuinely needs the decision to be authentic, notwithstanding, everybody sees equity distinctively as a result of their wants, interests, and backgrounds. All through the film, many juror's express partiality perspectives and need full thought to their obligation. One juror, who likewise experienced childhood in the slums, becomes cautious as a result of the current shame that any individual who was brought up in the slums is a thief or a killer. Another juror has passes to a ball game and needs to arrive at a choice before it starts. The film addresses whether individuals are really fit for choosing reality dispassionately. At the point when an individual is more put resources into their own needs, as opposed to the respectability of the framework in general, a legit and fair consultation is incomprehensible. Jack Warden, one of the jurors, needs to arrive at a decision quickly so as to go to a ball game. At first, he immovably concurs that the youngster is blameworthy however changes his vote when different jurors change theirs. Warden says, ""Help me out. Wake me up when this is finished. . . I'm somewhat tired of this as of now. We're wasting time quick. How about we split it up and return home. I'm changing my vote to not blameworthy."" His quick difference in supposition shows his absence of worry to think a really fair and precise choice. The film features the difficulties to majority rules system which requires noteworthy individuals to work. George Voskovec, another juror, typifies the American qualities that most residents trust is available in the legal framework. The main outsider in the gathering of attendants, Voskoevec appears to value the vote-based cycle exponentially more than the others. He reminds the hearers, ""We have a duty. This is a noteworthy thing about our vote-based system. . . We are advised via mail to come down to this place and choose the blame or blamelessness of a man we have not known previously. We don't have anything to pick up or lose by our decision."" Voskoevec's profound deference for American vote-based system makes him have huge confidence and hopefulness in the aims of his kindred jurors, which ends up being misinformed. In spite of his energy of the fair cycle, he starts to understand that a significant number of different members of the jury feel in an unexpected way. Members of the jury, for example, Jack Warden underestimate their opportunity and obligation, in any case, an outsider like Voskoevec comprehends the hindering impacts of a framework that does not have these qualities. His outrage is altogether advocated and fills in as an update that any vote-based cycle is basic. Notwithstanding want and energy bringing about emphatically one-sided thoughts, the juror Jack Klugman features the impact of past encounters when settling on this choice. Klugman turns out to be progressively protective when the thinking for the youngster being blame is that he was brought up in the slums. Being from the slums himself, he detests the conviction that anybody brought up in a slum is a killer or criminal.",12 Angry Men

3. Why so quickly 11 out of 12 men said that boy is guilty? Decision about somebody's life was carried out so fast. I expected more people would hesitate concerning final verdict.

1283,isaacmilhousetan,"12 Angry Men review with reference to ""Getting to Yes"" written by Roger Fisher",9,20 October 2020,"1. Introduction
Twelve Angry Men written by Reginald Rose depicts a story about twelve men with different backgrounds and characteristics coming together to form a jury, for a murder trial. The film takes place within a jury room where the twelve man takes a side and debate on the verdict of finding the defendant guilty or not guilty. With reference to ""Getting to Yes"" written by Roger Fisher, we will explore the different techniques employed and mistakes the twelve jurors made throughout the film.2. Arguing over opening positions produces unwise outcomes
In the movie, we can easily identify two sides to the argument, the guilty verdict side and the non-guilty verdict side. The jurors in the guilty verdict side tend to anchor themselves into their positions, they were constantly defending against attacks, rebutting every single point made by the opposing side. The more they defended it against attack, the more committed they became to it.During the initial portion of the debate after the first poll conducted by the jury foremen, juror 8 did not take a hard stand on his non-guilty verdict when questioned by the others. Instead, he admits that he was unsure if the defendant was guilty or not. He expressed that he merely wanted to explore the possibilities of the case. By not taking a hard stand at the beginning of the argument, it encouraged discussion with the other jurors rather than confrontation. Immediately after he said that, the jurors started to show interest in his train of thought, and they made the effort to reason with him rather than confront him. In the getting to yes book, it mentions that when arguing over positions, the more you try to convince the other side of the impossibility of you changing your stand, the more their minds won't change. For them to change their minds, they must believe that they can change yours. If juror 8 had made his stand with absolute certainty at the beginning of the argument, nobody would have wanted to make an effort to reason with him amicably. Effectively shutting down any hope of a discussion.Rather than focusing on positions, juror 8 wanted to create a discourse of the facts, compared to the other jurors who were quick to convict. When the other eleven jurors made a hard stand during their opening positions, their egos became identified with their position of guilty. If juror 8 had cling firmly onto his stance of not guilty, it would give the impression that he was stubborn and extreme, triggering the exact same behaviour from the opposing side. which would have reduced the chances of reaching a constructive agreement greatly.3. Listening to the other side
Throughout the film, juror 8 portrayed a non-aggressive demeanour, he doesn't give a rebuttal to every single point made against his, he even agrees with some of the points made by the opposing side. He understood that it is better to concede to a good point made by the opposition than to contest every point made. Not only does it make him seem less petty, but it also allows the opposing side to feel like their views have been heard. He listens actively and acknowledges what was being said by them. Compared to juror 3 who contested every single point made against his side, and never once acknowledge any of the good points brought up by them. According to Fisher, this behaviour would only give the impression that juror 3 has not understood the opposing side's points, which would cause them to constantly repeat the same points. While they are formulating a way to represent the same points being made, they would not be actually listening to juror 3's points.4. Hostility against one another
Juror 8 understood that this was a negotiation, not a debate. The purpose was not for both sides to try to persuade a third party, they were trying to persuade each other. In that sense, it is unproductivity to blame and belittle the opposing members, to engage in name-calling or raising their voices at each other. One bad example was when juror 10 made derogatory remakes about juror 5's upbringing in a slum. In response, juror 5 not only switched to the opposing side but also made a continuous effort to undermine juror 10's points throughout the remainder of the debate. Juror 10 made the mistake of attacking with his own personal prejudice against the defendant.Throughout the film, we can see both sides and especially juror 3 shouting their points over at each other. According to Fisher, anger and resentment often leaves one side feeling belittled and that their legitimate concerns have gone unheard as they accept the rigid will of the other side. Even juror 8 was guilty of such an infraction. During one scene, he broke his non-aggressive demeanour and called juror 3 a sadist, resulting in juror 3 lunging forward to attack juror 8. If it weren't for the other jurors holding him back, almost certainly a fight would have started. If that fight had started, the entire possibility for an amicable debate would have gone right out the window.According to Fisher, building a working relationship is key to making negotiations easier. The importance of establishing a good relationship with not only the opposing side but within your team is shown throughout the film.5. When to concede versus when to contest
When negotiating with other parties, it's natural to take a hard stand, to make the discussion go the way you want. Two sides, each pushing hard for their interests, will often stimulate each other's creativity. In the case of the jurors, we can identify when is it best to concede an argument versus when do we contest it. Whenever juror 8 is faced with an argument from the opposing side, he would decide if the point made was strong or not. Juror 8 demonstrates the time to concede an argument is when the point made by the opposing side is deemed valid, and if any counter made was personal in nature would tend to be viewed as immature. We only contest when the opposing point made was not a strong argument, either the facts were wrong or neglected, this is when you should contest. One example was when juror 3 mixed up the time taken by the witness to reach the door from his bed and was promptly corrected by the rest of the jurors. Instead of accepting it, he brushed it aside and implied that the whole argument was invalid in the first place. Not only did this stunt prove counterintuitive for his argument, but it also showed the rest that he was not able to accept any criticism, and possibly unable to be convinced of any other perspective.
6. Using an objective criteria and format for discussion
The first part of the negotiations was when it already started to go wrong. The jury foremen made the first mistake. Before establishing any sort of objective criteria or framework to approach the discussion ahead, he asked for a show of hands on who thought the defendant was guilty. In doing so, it forced everyone to make a stand before any productive discussion was made. According to Fisher, when one commits to a side, it is significantly harder to unmake that commitment to move towards the other side. Each side would then have to spend a significant amount of time and effort to defend their stand and attacking the opposing side, rather than approaching this discussion rationally.Instead, the jury should have discussed the details of the crime with an open mind, with no initial stand taken. They could have systemically laid out all the points made during the trial and approached each point with a fair standard. Only after every point has been discussed, then that's when they should have taken a stand. By doing so, it would be more of a discussion than a debate as they go through the findings. If they had done this, no one would have to back down, no one would appear weak. This would have mitigated many of the confrontations made during the film, as many of them were personal in nature addressing personal egos.7. Conclusion
The film is an apt example of what happens when you are unable to detach the person from the argument. Our personal prejudice and prior experience would interfere with any hope of a fair argument. The film also demonstrates how to address these problems in a discussion through the techniques mentioned earlier. It depicts what would happen if the discussion had been conducted poorly and the repercussions of the words and actions made by the various participants have on a productive discussion.BibliographyFisher, Roger, Bruce Patton, and William Ury.

1285,amandachuasineng,Interesting film,10,25 October 2020,"""12 Angry Men"" is a 1957 courtroom drama film which tells the story of a jury where twelve jurors have a debate on the conviction or acquittal of an 18-year old defendant based on reasonable doubt. The defendant is on trial for alleged murder of his father and he would receive capital punishment if found 'guilty'. This group of jurors have a wide range of personalities, backgrounds, prejudices and emotions, which intensifies the conflict. The film explores many techniques of negotiations and the challenges encountered in the process. At the start of the film, the first count of votes revealed a guilty-to-not guilty ratio of eleven-to-one. However, this ratio gradually shifts throughout the show and eventually all the jurors agreed on a verdict of ""not guilty"" unanimously.
Despite the negotiation methods in the film ""12 Angry Men"" being portrayed as effective, there are still many negotiation flaws that can be improved. The book ""Getting to Yes"" consists of many insights regarding effective negotiation methods to obtain the best outcome from a negotiation. These methods can be used to make the negotiation process in the film smoother. Overall, the film is outstanding and worth a watch. The issues addressed in the film are relevant today where emotions and racial stereotypes affects a person's reaction, and people negotiating are more concerned about their own lives than arriving at the best decision.",12 Angry Men
1286,matthias_oh,Review on 12 Angry Men: a story on negotiations,9,3 November 2020,"This simple but powerful movie showcases the complicated and profound nature of negotiations. In many scenes, it showcases the problem that is beyond a ""guilty"" and ""not guilty"" dichotomy; beneath the positional disagreements lies the conflict of personal interests and emotional struggles. Closely related to this topic is the subject matter of making a constructive negotiation, as expounded on further by Fisher in his book, ""Getting to Yes"". Below entails some descriptions of the movie that highlights the deeper running issues.Relational tensions between negotiators is implicated in negotiations, even if the discussions revolve around the subject matter at hand. Juror 3, who positively believes that the defendant is guilty, was clearly infuriated by the growing rejection of his verdict as Juror 8 argumentatively raised possibilities that suggest otherwise. In his rage, he resentfully shouted, ""What's the matter with you guys? You all know he's guilty!"", essentially dismissing the concessions made. His misgivings, chiefly against Juror 8, culminated in his exclamation that he will ""kill him!"". These emotionally-charged words do not reflect a rational argument, but his impassioned disrespect of Juror 8, proving that relational tension was a challenge against constructive negotiation. This conflict exemplifies a ""major consequence"" of the ""people problem in negotiation"", when the ""parties' relationship"" is entangled with their ""discussions of substance."" Positional bargaining will put the relationship and substance in conflict, hence Fisher encourages negotiators to separate people from problems and deal with the ""people problems"" directly. Even though Juror 8 did not directly address his relational tension with Juror 3, the film highlights its ability to complicate negotiations, which necessitates a separate resolution for the people problem.Anyone who wants to understand the complicated nature of negotiations, and learn how to meaningfully navigate a difficult situation with people should really watch this movie with intent.",12 Angry Men

The different insights that these 12 men had to a common set of evidence that they had heard, coupled with their individual experiences that were used by some of these men to back up their reasoning, emphasised how everyone should be open-minded in a discussion, ready to listen to the views of others that we may not have noticed.

1292,saritazhang,Really exciting,10,9 November 2020,"This film was amazing. I could not take my eyes of the screen; every moment of the movie was filled with detail, exciting debate and my brain was constantly engaged. I was deeply touched and greatly impressed by Juror #8's determination, courage, intelligence and calmness to persuade the other jurors to give the boy a chance. For myself, I took away important lessons about negotiation.In particular, it is a common mistake to focus on position instead of interest especially in decisions-making situations with a lot of people. This is because position is something that is outward and immediately obvious to the other parties involved, while interest is something that needs to be verbalised and made known. When only the position but not interests is known, people tend to get immediately upset over changes in positions because they are not aware of the reason. This can be seen in the movie, where strong supporters of the conviction of the boy are angered by the jurors changing their vote to ""not guilty"". This is despite most jurors (except for maybe juror #7 and #10) having the same interest to do what is right for the boy. With that said, expressing one's interests in a topic is an extremely useful tool in negotiation. When asked why he votes not guilty, juror #8 made an impactful statement by saying that ""there is reasonable doubt"" when it comes to the ruling. He stated that his interest was to take the jury's decision very seriously because they boy is young and his life is worth the long debate to come to a consensus (""We are talking about somebody's life here, we can't decide in 5 minutes.""). By making known his interest, he allows his opponents to think about their own interest, which, as said earlier, is to come to the right decision. This ""reasonable doubt"" is also what made the second last person to maintain the guilty vote, juror #4, change his mind.Please please please do watch this film!

And there is only one person among all, who does not even know, he just doubts. What will happen? What decision will be made seems to have no chance. This is a real movie. Each character is alive and with his own character, some believe only the facts, others just want to leave, and they do not care what impact they will have on the future fate of a teenager. Tension both in the room and outside the window. A summer shower tells us that the situation in the room is about to spiral out of control.

It took a simple story of 12 jurors testifying their evidence to prove that a Puerto Rican teenager is guilty or not guilty for the murder of his father and turned it into a gripping, intelligent, and unforgettable masterwork of filmmaking. As the movie goes on, we can see the jurors' motivations, struggles, and hardships as well as the storytelling of the movie just by the performances and dialogue alone which draws you There is no music during the time where they try to solve the case except in the opening credits, when the jurors take a bathroom break, and when the movie ends, and even with all of that, you still get invested in the story and the characters. That's Sidney Lumet understanding the art of film right there. Sometimes, you don't need music or special effects to help the story, you can tell it by performances and visuals. If you are invested in the characters, then you have a good story and 12 Angry Men achieves that flawlessly.The beauty of the movie is that it feels like an hour or 30 minutes short film when it's actually 1 hour and 36 minutes, but it never gets boring and uninteresting. When a movie feels a few times shorter than it's length, then it's a masterpiece. When I fast forward and backwards, it would say 40 minutes or an hour (I watched this on a Criterion Collection Blu-ray which shows the runtime when you fast forward or backwards) when it really felt like 20 or 10 minutes. That's insane, man. The most important thing about a movie in my view is pacing and 12 Angry Men is the most fast and relentlessly paced movie I've ever seen so it's also a masterclass of pacing.It's a flawless work of art and I would recommend it to any film buff regardless if they like pre-70s movies or not.

A young man is accused of manslaughter of his father and 12 jurors have to verdict. Throughout the movie, various questions were popping up in my head. Are we really allowed to decide who should live and who shouldn't? Is it possible to stay impartial and not let your previous experience influence such important decision? How hard must be confronting when you are a minority? ''12 angry me'' pushes you to reflect on very complicated topics.
The way that tension is held during the whole movie is akin to waiting for a thunderstorm. I was worried about the boy's life as if it was mine. I also felt deep empathy for the character of Henry Fonda, whose acting can not be unobserved. Fortunately, the thunderstorm ended in rain, which was also reflected in 3rd juror's crying.

1316,romainkanynd,Watch it if have time to waste !,3,26 March 2021,"As a team of film critics, we recently went to the cinema to see a broadcast of the movie ""12 angry men"" and God, what a great film for octogenarians! Maybe to give you our opinion about it, we must put this dud into context.12 angry men or ""12 hommes en colère"" in French, is a 1957 American courtroom drama film directed by Sidney Lumet and based on the eponymous piece of theatre of 1954 written by Reginald Rose. As Lumet is a filmmaker known for his tragedies and critics of American justice system, we were, as fans waiting for a harrowing masterpiece! But we think that our small introduction made you understand that we were disappointed.The movie unfolds in a jury room in which 12 jurors are deliberating the case of an impoverished 18-year-old boy who is accused of stabbing his father to death. Therefore, the spectator follows this uneven trial for not less than ninety-six minutes, which is of course a bit exhausting. However, you may be pleased when seeing the cast with Henry Fonda, which would be normal. Yet, he probably is the reason of the movie's recognition, because there is nothing else that distinguishes it from other courtroom films such as Liar Liar from 1997. Maybe, we are scandalmongers because you probably know Martin Balsam? Or John Fiedler? No, you don't? To be honest we think that Fonda, Mr Davis in the movie, or the juror eight truly makes the film. If the gamechanger, the one who was about to save the young boy by rebelling against the tyranny of the majority, was anonymous for the spectators, would people give the movie that much attention? We do not think so. Nevertheless, the themes addressed in this film seemed intrusting: the justice and the question of morality and values are omnipresent, but they would be the few positive points. In fact, it contains an underlying message about prejudicial actions, the difficulties to be a juror and even racism during the fifties. It provides an interesting perspective on the importance of being a juror and the possible biases that jurors could, and still can encounter nowadays. It is both dramatic and tense, and it is insightful in its depiction of various aspects of humanity. But we were unable to identify with this film as it was impossible to identify with any of the jurors, it felt like they were not communicating any emotion.Moreover, the script may seem ingenious but if you dig a bit it is not really the case and almost becomes boring at one point. It was so hard not to fall asleep while watching it. We were neither surprised nor excited to see the film and after we saw it. Don't you think the story is a bit far-fetched? Twelve brains take ninety minutes to agree on such an obvious case? Of course, he was not guilty. But after all, this movie kind of shows how screwed up the American justice system is. The poor boy is found guilty before all the evidence were even considered. Logic would dictate that he is not guilty until proven innocent, but apparently only one brain managed to take that detail into account, which made the scenario a bit inconceivable.To be the most objective as possible, 12 angry men is one of the films that did not aged well. Overall, this is a good movie if you like vintage (because it is trending again), slow-paced, and closed-door films. You can also go see it if you like films that denounce timeless issues that still occur today. Also, if you like Henry Fonda, you want to watch it because he still plays greatly. It can be a great old school classic, but definitely a waste of time for people, like us from Generation Z. If you are into more dynamic courtroom movies, we would advice you to watch more recent ones, such as ""Just mercy"" from 2019 or ""the Trial of the Chicago 7"" that was released last year!",12 Angry Men
1317,dogahalici,"Bold and Genius, Sidney Lumet.",10,19 April 2021,"12 Angry Men takes its place in very classics and beyond any dispute Sidney Lumet clearly shows what a genius he is. Movie starts with a teenage boy who is on a trial for murdering his father and there are twelve men in charge of deciding whether the boy is guilty or not. From juror's and audience's perspective case is pretty clear, nothing to doubt. After the first phase of voting, all vote guilty; except one of them: Juror#8. He also has no valid evidence but he thinks that sending a boy to death without discussing it properly, shouldn't be this easy. And from now on, movie puts states main idea to us. Due to Juror#8's persuasive abilities, the guilty votings starts to change. His desire for discussion convinces the other Jurors to think more reasonable than before and swaying their opinions to believe the boy is not guilty.The movie has unequal screen time for the characters, we mostly see Juror#8 and Juror#3 during the trial scenes. Juror#8 exhibits a behavior in a calm and clever way during the movie. He is also a charismatic speaker who has persuasive abilities.. On the contrast, Juror#3 is a prejudiced, loud-voiced man who has strong beliefs. They reflect two opposed authorities in the Juror Table.""Prejudice always obscures the truth."", this quote explains and summaries the whole statement in the movie. I think this should be the essential learning gained from the movie. We need to separate our past feelings and the situation we're having right now, especially, if the situation based on someone's life. What seems obvious no need to be true all the time, we should stop and review everything that might have happened. Having the power and the main authority in our hands shouldn't be corrupting us.",12 Angry Men

1345,Matt_beisly,B&W masterpiece,10,28 January 2002,"12 angry men is my all time favourite film ... the basic story evolves around the Jury discussions in a murder case, there are no action scenes, special effects, music score etc ... but its totally engrossing is acted superbly. This is a REAL film with a good plot and clever character development. It shows all sides of human nature, as each character comments on the case and we build up a picture of them and their personal views/feelings. There is hostility, racism, selfishness, anger which is subtlety developed during the film.The directing is very clever with lighting changes and close-ups of the Jury in the room which add to the tense atmosphere. I like the way Henry Fonda finally sways them all around to his way of thinking, he does take a chance on the first vote - luckily the old man comes to his rescue, the old man helps him again later on by spotting the'glass' marks on the witness, this is key evidence ... In some ways the old man becomes the 'hero' of the film aswell !?Anyway I don't care what anyone else says, the film stands tall on its own and does not require special effects/action scene frills to make it good.

1346,richie_wev,Incredibly Gripping,9,4 July 2011,"When the premise is that twelve men are presiding over a murder case during jury duty, anyone who has ever been required to attend jury themselves will agree that, this sounds like one hell of a boring plot. Nevertheless, 12 Angry Men has become an incredibly popular film over the years and for good reason. The plot is deceptively simple; twelve men in a jury engage in heated discussion with each other, over the innocence of a young man accused of murder. It appears to be a very open-and-shut case, yet the calm, enquiring and objective Henry Fonda's questionings cause the entire jury to turn on their head's as more and more perceptions start to come to light.The situation this jury finds itself in is in itself, incredibly gripping. We, the audience, look in on people who seem as though their opinions on the matter are firmly set in stone. Characters who at first are so certain about the ultimate outcome, they'd rather joke, talk about sports, boast about their business, banter or play crossword puzzles, rather than take the matter at hand seriously. Watching Henry Fonda manage to convincingly break down each and every one of their uncaring barriers is something highly engaging as he seems to be breaking down your barrier as well. Something about the way in which the story is portrayed almost makes you yourself feel like one of the characters in the jury; the film is shot in real-time, the characters opinions change with each monologue, the room you are in while watching the film almost becomes just as hot, stuffy and restless as the room in which these jurors preside in.Speaking of the jurors, another amazing thing about this film is what amazing characters they are. The twelve we are presented with are all unique and all of them have differing reactions to the situation they are in, the situation to be discussed and to each other and this is one of the most fascinating aspects about the film as a whole. First, there's Henry Fonda's protagonist, a man who despite being comparatively timid in contrast to the other characters at first, manages to show an admirable amount of unflinching will and integrity, without seeming to become annoyingly sanctimonious. Then there's Lee J. Cobb's excellent performance as our antagonist, Juror #3; a man who from the offset is more personally involved with this trial than he will willingly let on. My personal favourite character is the analytical stockbroker Juror #4 played by E.G. Marshall, as of all the characters in the room willing to vote guilty, he seemed to me as the most logical yet still open to reason.Of course, although the film is very good, it isn't perfect. It is however, good enough to the point where I can only really make 'nitpicks' rather than criticisms. One such nitpick is the use of close- up shots during the film, particularly the one's involving the old man, Juror #9, which I felt looked quite out of place. The film seemed to flow in a very much naturalistic way, for the close-up shots to be in any way effective. I did also think that while some of the evidence discussed in the juror's room on the young man's behalf, was very convincing, some of it did really seem as though they were grasping at straws; the talk about the knife in particular I found quite circumstantial. Maybe more information at the very start of the film, about the case at hand would have been helpful as well. Like I mentioned earlier however, these are minor nitpicks.12 Angry Men is an extremely interesting film; you have an interesting situation, a load of interesting characters and all of this is excellently executed. Considering the setting as well, these 96 minutes seem to fly-by as you never once find yourself bored. A very well justified, timeless classic.",12 Angry Men

I love the actors Henry Fonda is amazing and the rest of the acting is superb. Beautifully filmed in black and white with a epic storyline.You would think that a movie that is filmed 95% of the time in one room would be outstandingly boring. It's not.The characters have really realistic personalities and the dialog fits them to a tee. Obviously an epic to shake the ages for decades to come.

1350,vino_mailid,One of the Best Movies,10,31 December 2007,More than classifying the movie's Genre as Drama i would rate this movie as Thriller or even Action Movie. The action/thrilling is not with guns or with Knives but with Words.Actually i considered my self as a Jury member and i got convinced by those points provided by each and every member.I liked all plots/scenes except one jury who just tries to vote Guilty or Not Guilty only for a Base Ball Match ie the movie concludes with out getting convincing points/ideas for that particular Jury's Stand on why he is voting guilty or not guilty.All 12 Men have equal part to be played.I have not even felt boring for a single minute.The Screenplay is really the diamond over the Crown because it is very tough to make viewers/movie watchers to sit and watch a movie which is made with in a room with 12 people.Must watch Movie.,12 Angry Men
1351,cwlk07,The 12 Quarreling Men,4,24 January 2008,"""Life Is In Their Hands -- Dealth Is On Their Minds!"" A tag-line of 12 Angry Men.12 Angry Men had 3 nominations for Oscars and won 13 other awards, but it does not mean that every one will like this movie. While the movie started with the dark and white atmosphere it gave me a tiresome impression. 12 men were just sitting in a room quarreling and sometimes murmuring and muttering. Are movies only providing human acting and talking? Teenagers like me like to have something much exciting, but not sitting dully in a room. Secondly, I wasn't engrossed in the Juror quarreling during the film. I don't think most of you are interested in others' affairs, especially others' conflicts. Also, as the tag-line shows, the life and death of the boy is in their hands, but how about the audience? It seemed that we have already been left out. In addition, Henry Fonda is a good actor, however, when the movie ends, I think everybody would have asked ""Is that all?"" I still had a hope to see anything unexpectedly broken out before the ending, but what a pity that it did not happen.It may be a great masterpiece to most of people but I hardly have a slight interest on it. My comments might have changed if the 'debate' had an unpredictable result.",12 Angry Men
1352,heijona-1,A movie that I dislike -- 12 Angry Men,2,24 January 2008,"The main reason that I dislike this movie because it is played in black and white. It made feel tired, so I cannot concentrate in the movie.Another point is that it did not change much scene, they mainly acted in the jury room. They stayed in there for most of the time that made me feel uncomfortable and closely packed together. After that, I think they had talked to much about the case and they waste so much in talking the same thing. All in all, I don't like this movie because it is black and white and it seems to be that they were repeating the same point again and again. Therefore I don't like this movie at all.",12 Angry Men
1353,poddarss,The excellence of cinema,10,26 December 2015,"12 Angry Men (1957) stands out for more than one reason, it was based on a teleplay by Reginald Rose, and was the first feature film to be directed by Sidney Lumet. The story deals with a court case relating to murder of a man by his son. 12 members of jury are sent inside the jury room to deliberate over the case and determine whether the boy killed his father or not, we as viewer are unaware of the court preceding that happened before the deliberation. However before the start of discussion between the jury members a preliminary vote is taken to find out where everyone stands, 11 jurors call the defendant guilty without a second thought which leaves only Juror no 8 (Henry Fonda) with reluctance to call the boy guilty so early and without discussion, everyone else believes the case to be open and shut and pressurize the remaining juror to join their side, juror no 8 however has other plan. What follows is an amazing interplay of confrontation, clash of personality and display of bias in the cloak of logic. The screenplay is tight to the extent that you don't want to miss a single scene or dialogue, and mind you maximum movie takes place inside one room with an occasional shot of doorway but believe me you don't mind that a bit, in proverbial terms it is the place where ""all the action happens"". The beauty of the story lies in the way Juror no 8 kept insisting on the need to communicate with each other as there is no other way to reach at a logical and fair verdict, he himself is not 100% sure if the boy is innocent, but believes in the principal of American Criminal Law, one must be convicted of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt, i.e. to say that even if there is shred of a doubt that the man may be innocent than he should not be convicted of the crime. Everybody is reluctant to give the boy the benefit of the doubt because of their own reasons, some are convinced the boy is guilty, some are biased and some just want to get over with it so that they can continue with their plans. But what juror no 8 starts catches momentum and people slowly starts to see the light of reason and their conviction that the boy is guilty slowly starts turning into that maybe the boy is not guilty; every evidence presented during the trial is examined and re-examined, the previous notion that there is no doubt that the boy committed the crime is subsided by maybe the evidence was misinterpreted, mind you nobody is absolutely sure that boy is innocent but it is the possibility that the boy may be innocent that starts driving them.",12 Angry Men

The same with the rest of the players. I re-watched the scene in which Juror #10 gives his irritated speech about the poor, and the rest stand up one by one and turn their backs on him, and it was one of the best movie scenes I've seen in my life.

Some scenes they don't stop the camera for about 6-7 minutes and it not just one guy, they go all around to every guy in that room saying different things.

I was Stunned with the stupidity of the plot, Anybody who has watch any courtroom drama will understand my point when I say everything that Henry Ford ask the other jury members to consider should have and would have been raised in the courtroom by even the most incompetent of legal teams, The old lady and her glasses, and the slow walking old man being the two most obvious but not the only point in question.

Cobb showed nobody would be thought of defendant's guilt.I'm not saying the other actors weren't good but i think that Cobb has stolen most of the scenes. What i didn't like was that the evidences strongly suggested the boy is the murderer,and suddenly from nowhere Juror #8 (Henry Fonda) has brought weak points of view which couldn't so hardly prove the accused was not guilty and to quote Juror #10:""I don't understand you people! I mean all these picky little points you keep bringing up. They don't mean nothing.""'makes me think he was right.But the way the script is written at the end they let you make the decision you think is right since they are not showing any scene that would suggest the murderer(at least i was expecting that).

1367,jordandan53,One of the best films of all time,9,5 January 2009,"This film had to have been a risk to the producers. It was a film set almost entirely in one room, I believe there were only three scenes that took place out of it. It is hard to keep the attention of an audience with such a limited set, but this limited set was made up for with excellent dialogue and an intriguing story. The story is a very intricate mystery set in a jury room. There are no flashbacks or anything to show how the crime happened, as would have been the easy route. Instead the script allows the characters to paint a picture of the crime in the minds of the viewers through outstanding dialogue. The dialogue never stops and the mystery only deepens. Through this dialogue the characters reveal themselves to be a microcosm of society. It would be a difficult thing to not see oneself in at least one of the twelve characters portrayed.The script isn't the only thing that deserves credit, the cast brought these characters to life. Without the genuine humanity that the actors brought with them no one would have cared about the responsibility placed on the shoulders of these twelve man as to whether a man should live or whether he should die.The camera work was also excellent. With such small confines it would seem difficult to come up with new shots, but the cameras explored just about every inch of the room.All in all this film is a great feel good movie about the American justice system and how it should really run. And how emotions can be the difference between one man living or dying. Although I haven't seen every movie out there I believe that this is one of the best films ever made and deserves every bit of the praise that it has received over the last fifty some odd years.",12 Angry Men

Well, you can see that it's made in 1957 and maybe that's the reason...?!!The movie starts with a scene in the court(as usual in some movies) where the accused has been proved guilty and given a death sentence for committing a murder. Here comes the actual part of the film, where the scene now shifts to the jury room, where twelve men take part in a discussion. The beginning 20 minutes gives the details of jury member, how they're here. It's not so surprising that one decides the life of a boy/man by deciding him guilty or not guilty in order to get to a baseball game!!!As usual, you find an exceptional guy who keeps mum throughout the introduction of the movie(and steals the show for the rest of the part of the movie!!!). He's the only guy who said he thinks the boy was not guilty since there's a little doubt in the murder. And there it starts, the whole discussion takes place with a few breaks and at the end of vote count there seems to be increasing support for the boy being not guilty. However, there's a twist almost at the end of the film, where juror 3 and 4 tear apart the theories of the boy being not guilty. It's not the actual hero who proves the accused is not guilty, but watch for yourself.Another one whose performance is to be mentioned is the role of Lee.J.Cobb who's also the executioner and shows up the emotional stress at the end, exceptional performance of the father!!! Finally, I give the movie thumbs up if you're not a fan of action genres, but you enjoy a thrilling ride not through adventure but dialogs that's been crisp and provide a superb stroke of intelligence.",12 Angry Men

1379,rickoteo,"Slow start, but doesn't exceeds expectations nonetheless",10,5 November 2017,"Gripping, frustrating, and yet inspirational - 12 Angry Men is a compelling 1957 black-white courtroom film that showcases one juror's masterful negotiation process with eleven other disagreeing jurors. With a keen eye, one can easily observe a few techniques to bring to the table in their future negotiations and meetings. At the same time, readers of Roger Fisher's 1991 book, Getting to Yes would also find that many of his prescribed techniques can be observed in this film. 12 Angry Men was adapted from another screenplay written by Reginald Rose, and it tells the story of 12 jurors tasked with the duty to either convict or acquit an 18 year old boy accused of murdering his father after an argument. However, this task is complicated by the condition that the decision has to be unanimous. The film initially sees 11 out of the 12 jurors unanimously agree to convict the defendant. However, one juror (identified as 8) exclaims that there are reasonable doubts in the case, and subsequently builds on these doubts in his negotiation to finally convince the jury to acquit the defendant instead.This is a film that is recommended for anyone interested in understanding the workings of an efficient negotiation. Negotiation is a fairly versatile process, and there are always alternatives that one can take to ensure that it is resolved with an agreement that satisfies all the parties involved",12 Angry Men

1385,nsavvides,Fantastic stuff (spoilers),10,9 April 2003,This film is one of the most gripping films in history. Wonderful acting all round from every juror and an incredible script give this film pure classic status. Sidney Lumet does wonderful stuff to increase the tension in this one room where all jurors are discussing the fate of this man on trial. Lumet does this by upping the emotional stakes and increasing the heat in the room.Henry Fonda is brilliant as the only man whos can't decide on this juvenile. But the real star on show in this film is the script itself. it plays around with the case greatly and gives the audience a great detective story set in one room and a wonderful display of how ordinary people decide the fate of thousands every day. This film is gripping stuff and the tension never lets go. the ending is perfect as one of the jurors collapses in despair as he gives his thoughts,12 Angry Men

I cannot get myself to pay attention to old-fashioned movies, mostly because the older films are in black and white. With this movie being so old, the audio and sound system had very poor quality. I'm so used to listening and watching new movies with such amazing quality, that when I have to watch an old film, I lose interest very quickly. The actors in this film were not good in my opinion. They did not show different emotions to make the acting seem more realistic. Lastly, it was difficult to follow along during the film because the characters had no names. Even though I disliked a lot about the film; there are still a few things I enjoyed about it. One of them being the main idea of the film, I enjoyed the main idea because it was about a crime. Crime stories are one of my favorite genres. An interesting point that I noticed was that the movie and the written play reminded me of philosophy because the jurors would never know the exact answer or what actually happened. It was also brought to my attention of how often the votes changed throughout the film. This showing that there were good points and examples to cause the jurors to change their votes. Lastly, it's interesting that the only action that was given throughout the movie was Juror No. 10's yelling. This review shows what I enjoyed about the film, what I found interesting and lastly what I disliked about the film and written play 'Twelve Angry Men'.",12 Angry Men

I like this movie because one person (Juror. 8) convinced everyone and they all changed there mind. He was the only one that voted that the boy was not guilty in the beginning. But my most interesting part was when juror 3 changed his mind and even cried at the end. On the other hand, I did not like the setting because there was no woman in the movie. Lastly, 11 of the jurors were convinced at the end and the last person to change his mind was juror 3. There for it's an interesting movie to watch.",12 Angry Men
1393,danieljemiologreen,My Take On 12 Angry Men,7,22 October 2010,"I personally think the movie Twelve Angry Men is better then the play. Not just for the reasons that I like retro movies or that the acting was so bad it was kind-of funny. But for the fact that the movies plot connected to me in a way I don't think it connected with other people. Because I have a thing for law and I think that this plot and this movie/play showed me a different side of law that isn't really talked about, but is a big part of the process. The reason I picked the movie over the play was that I guess my era is used and is attracted to movies more then to reading also that it was funny that the whole movie was 90 minutes of twelve men sitting in one room which got really boring but not as boring as the play. This might not be the best. Another reason I don't like the play as much as the movie is that. I don't think everyone was interested as I was and didn't really follow along and when it came to their part to read I was ready and they weren't ready to read which was really boring. Because yo9u would have to wait for them and I think I fell asleep a couple times. But overall the movie was WAY better then the play. If you're into law I think it's a must see. Well before you see the remake. Just for some laughs.",12 Angry Men
1394,babynana,I didn't like the choices that the directer made in this movie.,1,21 October 2010,"In the movie The 12 Angry Man, I didn't like the choices that the director made in the movie. First of all, the actors were overacting and they don't sound and their emotion doesn't look believable. For example, when the juror number 3 was having his moment talking about his kid who he ""made the man out of him"" by abusing him and later his kid punched him and ran away. His emotions and the way his voice sounded doesn't seem convincing to me. It seems to me like they are just reading their script out loud. Secondly, the camera angle wasn't good. The camera was mostly close up and it was quite boring. You want the audience to look excited or interesting so they will pay more attention to the main points but this movie didn't do that much of a good job. For example, in the jury room, when they were voting one by one, the camera was close up to them that I didn't get to see the reaction on other juror faces when they were voting one by one. I think it will be good to see other juror face and trying to make eye contact with juror to change their vote. Finally, the actor that they chose to play the role of the boy who was abused all his life and is a trouble maker, the actor looks nothing like his character in the play. So there fore I think the choices that the director made in this movie weren't that bright and it could have been better and more interesting.",12 Angry Men
1395,mbarouk_23,Twelve Angry Men,7,22 October 2010,I thought that the movie Twelve Angry Men was great because of the way all the actors played their roles to perfection. This is a type of movie were no sound effects were use so it required the actors to really become the character they were portraying in the movie. Something else that I like was at first mostly everyone said that the accused was guilty of the crime but then slowly the jurors began to change their minds except for one juror. Some of the things that I didn't like was the way it was filmed in black and white because it cause me to have less attention towards it than I would have if I was watching a regular colored movie and also how the whole movie was just filmed in that one room and this did not allow us to see how the jurors lived their lives and acted around other people outside of a jury room. Between the movie or the play I would say I like the movie more because I am more of a visual person I learn things faster like that but other than that I thought the movie was interesting because of the way it allowed me to see and believe that character were who they really were when I was reading the play.,12 Angry Men
1396,sahmed1,*** This review may contain spoilers ***,8,5 November 2010,"The Movie Twelve Angry Men was a good movie. The plot of the movie was good. It was interesting to watch. What I didn't like was the movie was black and white, the actors were not that good at acting, and there wasn't any woman juror in the movie. The interesting part was how everyone thought the boy is guilty at the first except no.8, without even thinking and knowing anything about the case. But they changed their mind after talking and arguing with each other. And it was surprising how the boy was described in the written play actually he is totally different. He looks like an innocent little boy in the movie. In the movie the acting wasn't so good for example how the jurors were arguing and talking, it looked fake. It's a 50's movie that's why the sound system wasn't that good either. Also the jury room looked fake, how the inside of the room was. Altogether the movie was good but I didn't like the way it was made. And the most important thing was there wasn't any action in the movie which didn't impress the audiences. But definitely I would say it was better than the actual written play. So you can see what's going on in the movie instead of reading and imagining on your head.",12 Angry Men

This movie is related to a murder case and the jurors are trying to find out if the son is guilty of his father's murder. The best part of the movie I liked is where juror #. 8 is the only one who votes the boy not guilty and the interesting part of the movie was where all the jurors sit by their numbers so they can point to the right juror for their opinion. After few minutes juror #. 8 tries to prove that the boy is not guilty. He also finds a similar knife that was found at the murder scene and everyone was shocked to see that knife because all jurors thought they don't sell that kind of knife anymore. The movie is more interesting to watch then read the play out of a book because it has the action in movie and the way they talk to each other. It is1950's movie but worth to watch it. The best part of the movie I liked where juror # 3 in anger was really going to stab juror #. 8, but all the jurors stands up and say ""WOOOHH"" and juror #. 3 stops and they go back to their seats. At the end of the movie everyone agrees that the boy is not guilty. This is a must watch movie specially who likes to watch drama movies.",12 Angry Men

What I liked the most about the film and made me more intrigued with it was that the jurors were acted out just as they were described in the play even better. After reading the play and watching the film I would definitely choose the film just because instead of thinking and visualizing about how the jurors are speaking, acting or even of how they actually look you see it all in the movie and thats what makes it better then the play.

1399,mgray91,Intense court room drama,7,24 October 2010,"Twelve Angry Men was a very good movie, with good dialogue and an excellent cast. The cast had a lot of opposite personalities which made the dynamics on the movie very interesting to watch. Although the audio was not as good as present day films and the dialogue was occasionally slow, the tension and interplay of the jurors quickly picked up again and kept your interest in the movie. It was amazing how one by one Henry Ford's character was able to convert all the other jurors over to a non-guilty verdict. It was really scary how all of the other 11 jurors wanted to vote guilty just to get the trial over with because they didn't want to be stuck at the courthouse. They all had better things to do, like go to a baseball game or visit with the friends and they didn't want to look to closely at the accuracy of the testimony, but Henry Ford's character made them take the time to think it through. Watching the movie Twelve Angry Men was much better than reading the written play because you could really see all the characters more clearly. The emotions, the tension and the frustration was so much more obvious in the film and came across so much more strongly than it did in written form.

Also, when everyone says no guilty, he look like a wounded child, he know all of juror #8 say is be possible, but he doesn't want to lose he face, still says guilty, he doesn't want admit he is wrong, so he covers his shame with angry.For the montage, i like the scene links the part.

1401,liling-1004,Twelve angry men,8,28 October 2010,"I like this movie Twelve Angry Men, because this is an old black and white movie. The movie reminds me that when I was a little girl, my home had a small TV. The television screen also is black and white. At that time, neighbors came to my house to watched TV. They brought some food and fruit came to my house, then we talked together, ate together and everyone was happy. After we changed new TV, I watch black and white movie seldom. In the school, we watched Twelve Angry Men made me remember my old TV. Secondly, I like the story of the movie. From one man to all men agreed the boy was innocence, I think juror No.8 had good persuasion. He explained again and again, told other people the truth. Twelve different people have different personalities, but after they just united as one said ""not guilty""On the other hand, the reason why I don't like this movie because of the movie was always talking and talking all the time and they didn't do many actions. Also, the movie just had two kinds of music as background in the whole scene. If the producer can add more kinds of music, that will be great. Moreover, I don't like the room; it was too small .Everyone smoked at a crowded place made the air so muddy and the temperature was so hot. In the room, everyone was sweat, the clothes was wet.

1405,punkyper,"An inviting courtroom drama, with the suspense of a thriller.",9,21 November 2011,"If you were born in the late 20th century as I, there is a good chance you haven't watched the best court room drama of all time, which I hereby insist that you must. The title alone may not even be known to most people, and that is a shame, because ""12 angry men"" is a fantastic movie that definitely deserves attention. The movie depicts the ongoing ruling of 12 jurors, eleven of which are convinced that the defendant is guilty, but are all met with the resistance of one juror determined to question what seems so obvious to the others.The merits of the case, and the movie, are clear. A young man is charged with murdering his father and the evidence against him is compelling. As both sides have given their closing arguments the jury retires to their chambers, and is faced with the decision of condemning a man to capital punishment. As the setting is set for the viewers and the different characters introduced, the actual course of the movie takes place, and it begins with a preliminary vote: Guilty or not guilty. When the tone of agreement has been set, there are 11 votes ""guilty"" and 1 ""not guilty""; and as the 11 rests their eyes upon the one, juror #8, the movie unfolds in a uniquely interesting manner. Juror #8(Henry Fonda) starts off with nothing to validate his position, other than saying that he does not want to sentence a young man to death before at least talking about it. And from that point on, the jurors begin to explore the case's circumstances, all the arguments and testimonies, and one by one starts to rethink their position on the issue.What makes this so interesting to watch, is that the movie's plot unfolds at the same pace it unfolds for the characters. Apart from what was said during court, no information is held back, which puts the jurors in the same position as the viewers. This allows a deeper involvement in the movie, and creates a feeling that the viewer is uncovering the truth alongside the characters themselves. It almost feels like a detective/criminal investigation movie at times, and even though the movie ""suffers"" from old age and outdated cinematic effects, the suspense never ceases to exist. The excitement is also strongly affirmed by the growing tension between the jurors, many of which are greatly inconvenienced by their required presence. The feeling of claustrophobia grows larger, and as the persistence of juror #8 starts to affect some of the others, the viewer begins to understand the meaning of the title ""12 angry men"".As the title also suggests, the number of key characters is large, especially since they all appear on screen at all times. Despite this the movie never seems to confuse the viewer with a clutter of characters. Instead it constantly complements all of the jurors' presence, and never makes any of them feel expendable. This is achieved by presenting all the characters individually, but in such a seamless way that the viewer hardly notices that it's going on. This is also what helps emphasize the feeling of being on the same pace with the characters. As we learn more about the jurors, so do the jurors themselves. This process takes place throughout the entire movie, constantly evolving every character and makes it more and more clear, as to why everyone stands where they stand.All of these different things come together and deliver a weirdly subtle yet suspenseful drama, rich on both deep character involvement, and masterful writing. The movie appeals to the our sense of rational thinking, by making the characters question the circumstances of the case, while also making the viewer question them. On top of that ""12 angry men"" has a wide range of characters, and strikes a near impossible balance, of equalizing the importance of all of them, and thereby justifying their ongoing presence.This isn't a courtroom drama, this is THE courtroom drama, and it sets the bar of which all other movies within the genre should be judged.",12 Angry Men

One Great Movie.",10,14 December 2013,"When you look at 12angry-man you see a couple of people who made of dialogs and every single character made of own dialog (that exactly remember me the great film ""who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?""). The conversations between people appear things of their past and every single character help the plural of them. So we go from single to plural.Of one guy to all people. We never go out of Jury's room but real things and important things that we know of Jury's people is so bigger than size of room. And it's interesting, we don't need to go out of room, never, 'cause that strong characters give us strong and obvious things that help us to know outside and out characters. So we go of singular to plural. In the first, simply, we have 12 guy. They should decide guilty or not guilty of a killer. And this decision is make by 12 simple and ordinary people who are not characters but with hand-up of a one person ,act with Henry Fonda, the stories is beginning and we forget ordinary guys. They were not ordinary anymore. They were not tips anymore and every time we have vote, also they start to appear their self. Every time we have vote, one more plus to not-guilty peoples and that one person is that person who is passing from a simple mind to a strong character. Look at that moment in 52 min, when camera move to number 11# Juror man with mustache and very clever, in the duration of move he is thinking for decision, as if that duration we know what he thinks too. ha? What a art move by the director Sidney Lumet. And what is more important than it?, The director made somethings that move all a character's thoughts to people's mind who watch the film , made it without use of one dialog and one word just with a pan or move. This is cinema. In while of pan, We know he'll decides ""not guilty"" and he does it. Maybe in another movie, this camera move won't be great but in 12angry man, after 50 minutes and according to his speaks, yes it's great. This is art and art is continue with shot of hands. Hands who go up for not-guilty. Every characters is different and don't like with another. Every single man has a story in past. This story make in minutes of movie. Makes with their describes of their idea, their thoughts and their past. The film is puzzle. All of them is a part of this puzzle. A puzzle with 12part. And every single man had their puzzle with enormous part. Some guy complete their puzzle quickly, Simply. Some else don't like or don't want to complete puzzle like last vote man. Angry guy. He keeps his secret puzzle not complete but finally dose it with cry. He been alone as his son leave him alone and with cry he complete his puzzle. There's so words to describe every of 12 man. Every man have a story but i think it's great if we watch again and watch carefully characters and hear them and understand them. 'cause i think they are real and it's so better who keep them in our mind for years. Ha? Enjoy more maybe. Enjoy more than write about them. And this is cinema.But somethings about subject of movie. Who are 12 man? who Are they? maybe us? People who make decisions and post commands about others everyday, quickly and simply? Ha? People who don't know what from their past is influence on all ideas and thoughts of present? Yes of course. This move is about parts of human's life.",12 Angry Men

It also offers any filmmaker a perfect recipe for making a really good movie!* How many movies are made today that are worth more than one viewing? This is certainly one of those classics you can watch repeatedly; and to think, this was not a mega budget flick either!* I can relate to this film easily due to having a recent experience with jury duty. Certain things as depicted in this film may have been changed in recent years, but the basic truth remains the same. I found this movie quite fascinating!* This is one of the finest courtroom dramas ever produced by Hollywood! Sidney Lumet was a very underrated director!* Henry Fonda gives one of his best performances ever in this movie! I can watch it repeatedly!* 12 Angry Men is one of my favorite motion pictures of all time! It has one of the best-written scripts and 12 fine performances from great actors!* I watched it years ago and loved it back then. Even now when I watch this movie, it impresses me!* This black-and-white movie is a MUST-watch for everyone. It is not just a courtroom drama, it is about human psychology - about the way we judge each other based on our own preconceived notions and prejudices!* This is a timeless movie that will never age!

There is no other way to articulate the feeling you get after watching 12 Angry Men, perhaps the zenith of Sidney Lumet's remarkably talented directorial career, even more amazing considering this was his debut feature. It's just one of those rare golden gems of a film that gets everything, literally everything, absolutely right. Script, direction, performances, tone, setting, story, the lot. It's perfect. It's exciting. It's gripping. It's meaningful. It's moving. And it may be close to sixty years old, but all of the many things it's trying to say remain relevant to our society, and sadly perhaps always will. This truly is a cinematic masterpiece that deals with not only the rule of law and it's place in society, but along the way deep rooted prejudice, ego, the class system and the fragility of parenthood - all wrapped up in ninety short minutes.

1420,shahbaz5990,The best Court-Drama movie.,10,9 July 2013,"There aren't many films that can illustrate the power of a strong script and superlative acting better than Sidney Lumet's 1957 classic, 12 Angry Men. There are no startling visuals, no bravura camera angles, and no special effects. Just twelve men - all jurors - on a hot, stuffy afternoon, in a single room, debating the guilt, or otherwise, of an 18-year-old boy from the wrong side of the tracks. That it kept me riveted for its entire length is a tribute to Reginald Rose's dynamite script (adapted from his own play), the superb acting that fleshes out each character (remember there are twelve here, and each one is more vivid than those in a slew of modern blockbusters), and the sure but restrained direction from Lumet.The story is simple but no less relevant even now. A young, disadvantaged boy is charged with the stabbing murder of his father after an apparent heated argument. The case against him seems overwhelming, and the twelve jurors assigned to his trial retire to their chamber to decide on his fate. All are convinced of his guilt - all, that is, except juror #8 (Henry Fonda). He is not sure if the accused is guilty or not, but he wants to discuss the case a bit further. In the face of some stern resistance, especially from jurors like #3 (Lee J. Cobb), a spiteful man who has a personal reason to see the boy behind bars, #7 (Jack Warden), who just wants to record a quick verdict so he can catch a baseball game that he has tickets for, and #10 (Ed Begley), who is convinced that everyone in the boy's socio-economic group is a criminal, he starts to argue some of the prosecution's points. He points out some inconsistencies, and slowly some of the jurors come around to his point of view. Will he convince all of them there's enough doubt for a ""Not Guilty"" decision?",12 Angry Men

1422,mazyarmah,One of the most realistic classic movies of all time,9,15 February 2017,"The movie is based on a play, and almost the entire movie happens in a jury room. Such a small location, at first look, is more like a location for a play performance, not a movie. This fact leads us to think of a movie with more exaggerated acts. However, when you watch ""12 Angry Men,"" you realize that everything in the movie is so real, not only the setting but also the story, dialogues and characters. Compared to other movies at that era (or even today), ""12 Angry Men"" is not a long one (it is just about 90 minutes), yet, as Roger Ebert once said, it ""sometimes feels as if the movie is shot in real time."" From the moment that the jury members enter the jury room, we start to know them one by one and step by step through their short talks and conversations about simple ordinary things such as the weather or their jobs. And this is what in a real life happens. It is very interesting to me that, despite this fact that the movie was made about 60 years ago, the characters and their conversations seem very real and alive. I believe that everything in this movie is ahead of the time it was created. We all know that actors are performing their acts and delivering their dialogues directly and word by word based on the screenplay. Nevertheless, we never realize this fact when we are watching the movie. You think that everything is happening right before your eyes, exactly like what happens in a documentary movie. In a classic setting, usually there is only one character who speaks or acts, and others usually wait for him to finish his or her statement and then start to talk or act. This is not that common in real life because people react to others' statements or acts in a real-time, and do not wait for them to finish their words to show a reaction. In ""12 Angry Men,"" we see this kind of real scenes a lot. We see two or three characters speaking in front of the camera, and at the same time we hear other people's reactions or see some other actions in the background. everything is real, fast, and believable, exactly like what happens in our daily life.",12 Angry Men

They retire to a jury room to do their civic duty and serve up a just verdict for the indigent minority defendant (with a criminal record) whose life is in the balance.

1433,haf-lf3,An excellent parable about the importance of standing up for your views,9,27 November 2011,"First, the fact that the majority of this film is shot on one set where at various points, all four walls are visible is an impressive technical achievement. The camera work and set manipulation that this feat required must have been agonizing to plan and execute in a way that does not break the viewer's suspension of disbelief.However, the film is noteworthy for more than singularly impressive camera work. It is a work of masterful acting in that the players disappear into their roles and all that the viewer sees is a man seeking to give a boy the benefit of the doubt when the rest of his life is at stake. The specifics may differ, but this is a sentiment that all people can agree upon, and this is why this is a great film: everyone has been in a position where they have had to convince a group of people that their position was the right one, partially through rational argument and partially through a sharing of gut feelings. But this shared experience is why this film is relate-able, why it is a movie that transcends cultural boundaries, and why in the year 2011, a inner city black male watching this film will be as moved by it as a suburban white girl who sees it in the year 1955.This film really isn't about the boy, or the trial, or who killed the boy's father. It's about feeling passionately about something, and then going to whatever lengths to convince others of that, whether they have just as strong and rational an argument as you do but in opposition, whether they have an inner, purely emotional antagonism towards your point of view, or whether they simply don't care either way about the outcome. This film works on a different level than most movies do, and that is why the names of the jurors, the names of the boy, the arguments of the lawyers during the case, or who really killed the father, none of that is important. What is important is that one man decided to make a stand against eleven others because he felt that his position was right, and whether it was or not, his actions will resonate with every single viewer of this film who has ever took a stand on any issue and had someone tell him that the issue was ""cut and dried.""",12 Angry Men

Yet 12 Angry Men uses such an interesting character study and dialog it maintains our attention level the whole way through. The film does slightly drag at the beginning, but Fonda amuses us by gradually picking apart the case bit by bit. This is, in my opinion, one of the greatest films ever made. It belongs on the shelf of any movie lover. Cobb delivers an outstanding performance as a bitter, torn father who has had a rough relationship with his son. Fonda is displays one of the greatest performances I've ever seen as the average family man who turns the tide of jury. E.G. Marshall is the intelligent, cocky Juror 4.

1448,tamzhermin,Intriguing way of looking at things,8,18 October 2020,"The movie ""12 Angry Men"", offers insight into how negotiations can succeed even when the world is against you, as long as everybody takes a moment to talk. Although the movie presents an extreme case of negotiating over a human life, a lot of parallels can be drawn onto our reality, where decisions can range from small to big. Yet in every one of these decisions, it takes great courage to stand up for your beliefs when everybody else in the room can look so adamant about their views. But if one were to give up without trying, staying silent, or worse, conforming to the majority, can lead to regrettable decisions. Each of the 12 characters in the movie, though there exist overlaps, reflects certain human behavioural archetypes that describes the various groups of people in one can find in society.Overall, this movie shows how one can dismantle the points of others, even when they may be very adamant about their views in the beginning. Oftentimes, this can be done by using the same points that are pointed out, and instead use those points against them by forcing them to reflect upon themselves and realising the areas that they had overlooked.In many ways, the 12 men in the movie reflect our inner thoughts as well, not just society as a whole. In almost every decision we make, our initial thoughts are often biased and full of prejudice. Though it is not necessarily wrong to be prejudiced, since often times, they allow us to be efficient in our decision-making, it opens up many holes in our judgments, causing us to overlook things that appear obvious.Hence, what we all need is a Number 8, a voice in our heads that asks questions again and again, until we have a definitive answer. In fact, I believe that Number 8 could very well have been convinced otherwise, and voted with the rest of the men eventually, but he would only have been satisfied if everyone gave their reasons convincingly, after discussions, and second thoughts.",12 Angry Men

Murder weapon, motive, eyewitness testimony all in place. One juror (H. Fonda) however, wants to talk the case out. He's not 100% convinced that the boy did it. And so everything starts. An emotional roller coaster follows as we learn about the jurors, their reasons for voting as they do and how they are forced to re-evaluate the evidence. Part of the charm of this film is it's starkness. 98% of the film takes place in one room; the jury room, a simple set consisting of little more than a table, 12 chairs, some windows and a fan. The best part, in my opinion, is the character development of the jurors. When the movie begins, they are just 12 unknown characters. Even though none of the jurors are named, in the end of the movie, you feel as if you know and understand every one of them.

His character made me feel that every single person's ideas actually matter as individuals. I almost believed, it was Henry Fonda himself, defended that young man, without knowing that he is innocent for certain. Yes indeed, there mustn't be even a little bit of an uncertainty when it comes to execution of a person. An honest man with doubts would defend him at all costs. And I saw an honest man when I looked Fonda's(Juror #8) eyes.

Adding a bit of personal touch, I can say this is the only film I've seen more than 3 times (5 times). I even created this account on IMDb just to review this film.Being accustomed to color films, initially I thought that this film would be quite dull and boring. But I still decided to give try, considering the high rating given to it in most of the movie rating sites.Initially, at least for the first 10 minutes, it was boring. The jurors were chatting among themselves, going to washrooms, cursing the heat... But as the actual arguments began, it became interesting; I mean really interesting. Of course, it was obvious what the final verdict would be: the boy was to be acquitted. But the way the arguments were presented was fabulous. It never appeared like a film. Instead, it appeared to be a real debate- with jurors showing emotions, ego and prejudice- just like in real life. The acting was fantastic with almost all actors performing extremely well( 8 of twelve were very good. Rest four were good enough, though slight improvements were possible. I forgot their numbers so I'm cant point 'em out)There isn't much of a plot to this film. Almost whole of this film is made up of dialogues. In fact the plot is so small that it can be written in less than 50 words( movie is about 100mins long).The entire filming(90%) takes place in just one room (including attached bathroom). Basically, its the arguments that makes this film an all time masterpiece. Traditions may change, style may change, but logic and rationality doesn't.In my opinion this movie is a ""must watch"".P.S.: DON'T WATCH THE REMAKE AT ANY COST. It is terrible. I mean really hopeless. Yes, it is in colour, but the acting is so bad that I couldn't watch it for even 10 minutes. It appears like a sham. The dialogues are almost the same as the original film but lacks the charm. I would prefer watching the old movie again over watching the remake. The jurors appear to be anxiously waiting for their turn to speak out the dialogues they have memorised. The main character appears weak and fragile. The other jurors appear like students acting in school plays: only thinking of when their turn comes, stiff, lacking spontaneity.",12 Angry Men
1459,drewchainz,96 Minutes of Pure Debate,10,21 February 2017,"Sidney Lumet has honestly outdone himself with this experimental film. To risk filming the vast majority of a movie in a single jury room is unprecedented. Henry Fonda, the lead actor in this film, dons the screen as the seemingly innocent, straight laced man in his 30s or 40s that just can't seem to find an accusatory bone in his body. After seemingly obvious evidence of a murder is presented to him, he is not too quick to jump the gun. It was strange, albeit refreshing to see Fonda display the 8th juror with such suave when the last film I had seen him in was Once Upon A Time In the West, where he plays a very convincing antagonist. The spark of a lively debate between a myriad of different points of view and opinions brought life to the screen throughout, which seemed to contradict the fact that all 12 of these men never left the jury room.I recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of well-written dialogue and certainly recommend you put the English subtitles on so that you can take in its full effect.

Lumet very smartly kept most of the film in the jurors' room, which heightens the tension and forces the audience to pay attention to every small detail that is presented in the film. In no way does one feel constrained by the restriction to one location; rather, it is almost as if we are transported into the room. The way the plot is laid out manipulates the audience's perception as well. Lumet invites us to make a judgment on the case at hand - although he also makes a point about how judgments can be easily changed and that perhaps we don't know ourselves as much as we thought we did. Henry Fonda, especially, sells the character well. It is an honest depiction of real people and how real decisions are made. His argument - that he isn't sure if the accused is guilty but at the same time isn't sure if the accused is not guilty - is thought-provoking, as it acknowledges the ambiguity of life.

1478,heartbreakk-643-416253,An Old Gem,9,29 March 2017,"12 Angry Men is a movie about a panel of jurors deciding if a young boy, accused of murder, was guilty or not. Throughout this movie, the process of negotiation from the book ""Getting to Yes"" by Roger Fisher is applicable. During the first stage of negotiation, the situation is diagnosed. Information is gathered, with hostile perceptions and self-interests being identified by the negotiating parties. Most of the jurors' self-interests involved leaving the room and reaching a 'guilty' verdict quickly. Coupled with the warm, uncomfortable room setting and other personal reasons, the jurors were likely to accede to the pressure of wanting to leave, making a hastily, undeliberated decision. Initially, peer pressure and groupthink impaired a rational decision-making outcome. Some were firm in their choices, raising their hands quickly to indicate a guilty vote, while others looked around the room first before slowly, hesitatingly raising their hands. The major obstacles include premature judgement, which was derived from not separating the people from the problem. The boy was from a slum background. However, some jurors perceived children from slums to be societal threats, having violent tendencies and bad behaviour. Hence, they wanted the boy to be voted as guilty as it benefited society. In the first vote, Juror 8 was the only one to vote 'not guilty', emphasising the importance of focusing on interest, not positions. Standing by his principles of justice, he explained to the rest of the jurors that his core concern and interest was serving a fair trial. He maintained that he did not want to take a position on whether the boy was indeed guilty without a thorough cross-examination process and further discussion. Following that, he acknowledged their interests of wanting to end the discussion and he proposed spending more time discussing about the issue at hand, rather than immediately deeming the accused as 'guilty'. His proposal was consistent with some of the other jurors' principles and values, such as Juror 9, who agreed that there should be a longer discussion. Juror 8 has also recognised and understood emotions displayed by the other jurors. For instance, he coaxes Juror 7, who was feeling impatient to catch his Yankees game, that it was possible to spend an hour without missing his game. During the planning stage, ideas to resolve the issue are being generated. At this point, some of the jurors already perceived the negotiation process with a common collective interest, on deriving a verdict based on principle and not pressure. They were more receptive of actively listening on plausible ideas on the boy being 'not guilty'. Having objective criteria helped the jurors to focus on interests, not positions. The jurors were constantly reminded that if there was reasonable doubt on the boy's guilt, they should vote 'not guilty' unless otherwise. A fair procedure was involved. For example, all the jurors had to come to a common consensus of twelve 'not guilty' votes. If they were unable to come to a consensus, it implies a hung jury. All jurors had a chance to share about their perspectives, in a round-robin manner. This allowed everyone to have a feeling of participation and a stake in the verdict, with their interests being accounted for if they were stated explicitly. Juror 8 constantly probes the other jurors who voted 'not guilty' why so. This allowed the jurors to think through their decision on whether it is rational. He does not attack their positions, but acknowledges that there could be a possibility that the boy may be guilty. One collaborative idea was the re-enactment of the eyewitness accounts, such as the old man claiming to notice the defendant escaping the murder scene. During the re- enactment, the jurors realised that the old man could not have reached the scene in the 15 seconds he had claimed in court. This convinced the remaining jurors that there may be reasonable doubt on whether the boy is indeed guilty, as the confessions may be false. During the discussion stage, differences in perceptions and feelings are acknowledged and addressed, resolving the conflict. The insistence on reaching a verdict was based on principle and not pressure is exemplified through Juror 4, who wanted to be convinced based on logic and facts. Furthermore, when Juror 3 still insists that the boy is guilty, Juror 8 wanted to hear his arguments as he was not convinced. Hence, the differences in perceptions and feelings are made explicit. It was clear that Juror 3's judgment was impaired due to a personal conflict with his son. Emphasising with the other parties' emotions is also key to separate people from the problem. Even though facts are important, empathy is more crucial. It is paramount to recognise that the other parties have emotions, deeply held values, and different backgrounds and viewpoints and as such may be prone to cognitive biases and prejudice (Page 28). One explicit example was Juror 10. When he started ranting about how slum children were dangerous, the rest of the jurors turned away from him, remaining silent. It was evident from his emotional outburst that he had a ""personal prejudice"" against slum children and their social background. Reactive emotions are not convincing in a negotiation. The displays of anger by Juror 3 too made his stand less convincing. The jurors tend to not be receptive of what he said. In conclusion, 12 Angry Men illustrates how successful negotiations often require careful analysis of different perspectives and arguments put forward. Emotions and positions should be separated to reach an objective outcome, satisfying all parties' interests and needs.",12 Angry Men

I mean writing an ideal script of 12 people in one scene in this way is amazing by all of these people who are from very different backgrounds and don't know each other. Also they not just chatting or hanging out, they are working in very difficult conflict which they have to solve in in one season. The several transitions and changes in this long scene is so flawless and smooth in a way that you would definitely believe it is all logical and so reasonable.

1482,leowty,Great Movie showing negotiation techniques.,10,3 November 2019,"The movie ""12 Angry Men"" provides an effective illustration of how effective negotiation can be led and carried out. It was a demonstration of skillful negotiation technique that by judge 8 that allow him to achieve success.The key takeaway is to always understand the perspective of the other party. As mentioned by Sebenius in the book ""Getting to Yes"", people tend to be hardwired to focus on their own position in an argument (2001). Over-commitment to this position will tend to lead to self-serving bias, where information is unconsciously interpreted in a self-serving way. This is especially so when they do not understand the different perspectives. As seen in the 12 Angry Men, understanding the perspective of the other party is key to a successful negotiation (Fisher, Ury, & Patton, 2011). In the movie, all the jurors have the common interest of wanting justice to be served. Juror 8 understood this and utilized it to his advantage. He asked for a discussion and was able to understand the other jurors' decision-making thought process. This allowed him to address the key issue directly, seen by his questioning of the witness's ability to hear in the presence of a passing train (Jurors 5 and 6) and rationalizing the boy's weak alibi (Jurors 4). This allows for the reduction of the area of conflict, increasing support for his argument. Fundamentally, Juror 8 was able to convince the other jurors by appealing to their shared interest of wanting justice to be served and addressing their concerns. This could only be achieved by understanding the different perspectives.",12 Angry Men

Henry Fonda is also the lead star in the movie, playing the character of Mr. Davis who is one of the jurors.The movie shows how a person can keep a cool level head and still manage to convince even the toughest of people about something that is right.The movie also is intense in the fact that Mr. Davis manages to break the prejudice of 2 of the jurors. One of them was heavily prejudiced against slum-dwellers and feels the boy is ""automatically guilty"" since he is a slum-dweller and so according to him violence runs in his blood. Another juror is heavily prejudiced against unfaithful kids, because his own kid had deserted him and run away from home about 2 years back.A classic must-watch movie. There are many things that we can learn from this movie. The moral of the story is in a way to be simple, cool, sensible and level-headed.An interesting fact is that of the entire 94 minutes of the movie, 91 minutes are filmed completely in the juror's room and only 3 minutes are filmed away from the room.A pleasant change from modern day Hollywood movies,which seem to be overtly obsessed with intense computer generated graphics, loud background music, things blowing up everywhere on the screen, aggressive angry characters, etc.In ""12 Angry Men"", there's no overt aggression, no fight scenes, no fancy graphics, nothing. It just displays sheer amazing individual acting talents by all the actors.A must watch and a definitely recommended movie for your private collection.Enjoy!",12 Angry Men

1488,jameshetfield2,perfect movie,10,19 May 2021,"""12 Angry Men""'s brilliance doesn't lie in special effects or razzle dazzle. It is, by all accounts, a simple, straight-forward film that is beautifully scripted and perfectly acted in its portrayal of twelve male jurors deciding the fate of a Latino boy on trial for the murder of his father. The case seems obvious with a weapon and eyewitness accounts, and the initial vote is 11-1. One juror, Mr. Davis, certainly has doubts of the boy's innocence BUT he has enough doubt of his guilt and a sense of responsibility to talk it out as their decision could result in the death penalty for this young man.In his time, Henry Fonda gave magnificent performance upon magnificent performance. I doubt any list of the best actors of the the last 100 years could possibly be considered complete without him. As Mr. Davis, Fonda is nothing short of brilliant. Yet, his brilliance here is an under-stated brilliance. It is not a showy performance or a histrionic performance or a dramatic performance. Fonda plays one man, Juror #8...an architect, who is capable of calm reason and calmly reasons that the facts may not be what they seem. Perhaps the reason Fonda was passed over for an Oscar NOMINATION here is that he was so normal, so everyday that he didn't even appear to be acting. Brilliance. Simply brilliance.""12 Angry Men"" is a powerful, historical film that brings to light the American justice system AND yet also examines deeply the intimate ways we relate to each other in our everyday lives. Nearly 50 years after its creation it remains a vital and critical piece of American cinema. There are those films in life that simply take your breath away...they change who you are, how you think and how you feel. ""12 Angry Men"" is such a film.Independent.",12 Angry Men

1490,tobias-jaeger,Probably the most timeless movie ever made about negotiations.,10,23 August 2013,"12 Angry Men is probably the best and most timeless movies ever made about negotiations, negotiating conflict and standing up for a personal belief. In today's world of nanosecond attention and immediate judgment and decision making 12 Angry Men is a powerful reminder to follow personal instinct, gut feeling, and sound, calm reasoning to come to a fair conclusion. As high profile trials are becoming more and more a TV prime-time event, especially in the United States, everyone who is following it wants to get an answer to the question ""did he/she do it?"". As only fragments of the information are available to TV audiences so it seems that the jurors in 12 Angry Men are only presented information that is easily interpretable from two completely different, opposing angles. The amazing use of stylistic devices builds and reinforces the tension among the jurors from the first to the last minute. The film is truly a timeless classic that is a must watch for virtually anyone.",12 Angry Men
1491,chester_amber-729-506433,Superb Movie,10,14 November 2013,"I am studying this at the moment, and it is the first play/movie that I have thoroughly enjoyed at school. We watched the movie before reading the book, and I thought it would totally ruin my understanding of the book. However, much to my disbelief: it helped me understand the book more. This movie is practically word for word of the play, and every action is demonstrated. *This movie works magic*. It managed to get my whole class (17 year olds)to be interested in a black and white movie. NOT many movies can do that. The movie doesn't have much going for it: Shot in a jury room (the whole film), black and white, and not much of a story line (at first glimpse). However, some way or another it manages to make the audience feel worried and suspenseful at the end of the movie? I think it is the development of each and every one of the characters, and the numerous lessons to be learned. I will remember this movie for the rest of my life. *For anyone reading this review: Watch this movie, you will NOT look back*.",12 Angry Men

1493,KDiggedyDawg,"I never thought I'd like black and white movies, this changed my mind",10,20 November 2015,"I'm a 22 year old movie lover, born in 1993 and I was sure I only cared about movies in colour, made after a certain point in time. Yet I recently decided to watch as many movies as I cold from the ""top 250 movies voted by IMDb users"" as I could, but held out on this one because it was old and not in colour.Never have I been so wrong, and never have I been so glad I gave a movie, I probably otherwise would never have watched, an honest chance. I have also never written a movie review on here because I didn't think I was qualified, but this movie deserves all the praise it can get.This movie might just be one of the best I have seen, and there are multiple reasons for that.I personally like when someone is able to take a simple concept and make it interesting and much deeper than it first appears, especially when it come to movies, and especially when it also involves analyzing the human psyche / the way humans think.This movie does not only do that, but at the same time presents an excellent variety of 12 everyday but still VERY different characters, all with different viewpoints and ways of thinking, all of whom is set with the difficult task of deciding if an 18 year old boy from the slums is guilty of murdering his own father or not. And all this, the entire movie takes place in single room with only these 12 characters and a table between them.The 1 hour and 36 minutes this movie is just flew by, I was that taken away by the characters and their arguments for the young boy being guilty or not guilty. To me that is fantastic movie-making, and the kind of movie i will let myself be inspired by if / when I myself become a director.10 / 10, I recommend this movie to any serious movie lover, and it absolutely still applies to a modern audience, I am a good example of that.",12 Angry Men
1494,emzilla08,Amazing!,10,16 July 2013,"I personally thought that the film improved because it is a B/W movie. I believe that if we had of transformed it into a color, high definition film it would loose the detail. If it had have been In color then you could not get the feel of how intense the heat was because you could literally see the sweat drip off of their skin. If it had of been color that detail would have been lost which would of had a huge negative impact upon the storyline. The atmosphere wouldn't feel/appear so intense! Also the storyline is that of which cannot be matched or compared. It was a lower budget film, which was set in one room with the occasional court room or outside steps but other than that no other setting. It is mainly based on very complex yet strangely understood characters (12 angry men, 1 teenage boy) that is it and we only see the teenage boy at the beginning of the scene placement. Yet as simple as it may be it is a classic must watch film of the past century. Any film buff must see it to understand how intense old movies used to be.",12 Angry Men

I were very excited when I saw it juror were fighting about the crime and who did it, I really loved how they thinking intelligent dialog, and not much physical moment feeling It didn't need big expensive scenes or computerized takes This movie makes you wonder whether the jury system is the best way of deciding the outcome of a court case. You can watch this movie whenever you want because you never bored and you can't take your eyes from the screen. I recommend this movie to all my friends seriously it is one of the best movies I've ever seen",12 Angry Men
1496,ayushman-basu,Why 12 angry men should be number 1 on IMDb top 250 list.,10,24 July 2013,"I don't know whether I will give any movie a 10 on 10 rating ever in my life again, but 12 angry men is such a movie even a whole 10 is an understatement to describe it's magnitude and brilliance.I strictly follow the IMDb top 250 list and I have made it my personal mission to see and understand each one of them to the best of my ability. So obviously when I saw 'The Shawshank Redemption' on number one I saw it and gained a perception that it was the most complete and meticulous movie I have ever seen. But that was until the day I witnessed '12 Angry Men'.Personally, I am not a very big admirer of court room drama or anything related to court room drama. There are very few court room dramas which I like. So I wanted to try this movie out as I heard a lot from my fellow movie buffs. Black and white picture and the camera rolled on filming each and every corner of the New York City courthouse. From the initial scenes I thought that I was in for a boring court room drama. But I was kind of optimistic when the scene of court room was over in some minutes and the 12 jury members came into the room. From there I was mesmerized.Short, crisp, witty, and outstanding are some of the adjectives which I can use. The way the movie portrays the differing mindsets of the jury members and especially my personal favorite Juror number 5 played by Lee.J.Cobb, it gives the movie a different and unusual edge which I don't find in other dramas.It will be cruel of me to compare 'Shawhshank Redemption' and '12 Angry Men' but when it is a matter of ranking there must be some aspects where the both can be compared. Both of the movies are excellent in their own ways. But, for me 12 Angry men takes the edge over Shawshank Redemption in the area of script and idea. Shawshank redemption spans over a variety of areas and characters which in itself gives the movie an edge over others, although I am not questioning the acting capabilities of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. I was engrossed and enthusiastic throughout the whole movie and it gripped me. But to create that same effect in a small and claustrophobic room of a courthouse is according to me a much more arduous. 12 angry men doesn't have a huge surrounding which elevates the viewers experience of seeing the movie apart from the dialogues. It only had 12 rational, emotional, and sweaty jurors who were in an intense deliberation of murder case.Another small fact which I noticed in the movie was the close up shot of the young boy whose trial was going on. That shot must have lasted for only seconds, but those that small face shot captured the sadness, bewilderment, abhorrence and insecurity of the boy. For me, that small scene was one of the best schtick I have ever seen.Although I have no problem with seeing long movies which span for 3 to 4 hours, but I got my so called 'viewer's satisfaction' in one and almost two hours on seeing 12 Angry Men and that too to an extent a little more gratification than 'Shawshank Redemption'.For me, 12 Angry Men till now is the best flick I have seen till date. I am waiting for such a film who can knock this one from the mantle. Till then, next time.",12 Angry Men

But when I watched this film, I changed all my mind about it.The film is literally masterpiece. There is no action or mind-blowing parts. All story goes on in one room and the thing is almost everything seems as mystery, but real. The case which our jury have to decide about, jurors, their actions and judgement is so well considered. One of the most interesting parts of the film is that no name mentioned until the very end.Also it is very hard to shot the whole film only in one place, one room. So crew had done great work.

The 96 minutes that you spend watching the film will definitely change the way you think (If you do think that way).A simple yet very effective story that runs like a knife in butter, smooth as silk and crisp as a nut.

I think it should be a requirement that this movie be seen by every jury, before jury deliberations begin. It is a blueprint for how it should be done. If all juries watched it, I think it would help them to really think about all the facts presented, and help them be better jurors. They could not help but to consciously fight against preconceived opinions and prejudices within themselves and from others. Lee J. Cobb just rips my heart out, and I cry right along with him at the end, every time. It is obvious that the majority of IMDb voters are youngsters with computers and internet access, who probably have never even seen classics like this, as evidenced by the huge difference in the number of votes cast.

1504,khayaadams,One of the Greatest films I have had the pleasure of watching,10,24 September 2013,"There are not many films that can keep you listening intently and watch every move the actors makes but 12 Angry men is one of those movies. Running at an hour and a half and practically the whole one and a half takes place in the back room of a court however never once did I feel bored or uninterested.Each actor brings something to the film, they each play their characters to perfection. Lee J. Cobb in particular plays his character so convincingly one forgets at times that he is acting. This movie goes to show that you don't need fancy effects and expensive sets to create a great film. You just need a great script and superb acting and that what one gets with this film.The plot itself moves along at a pleasing pace. The side talks between the jurors just reinforces the characters that the actors are playing. As I am writing this there has been so news about Jack Klugman being snubbed at the Emmy's and if you watch Mr. Klugman in this film you would understand why people are upset. This has become one of the greatest films I will probably watch and I am saddened that I didn't get to see it sooner.",12 Angry Men

As the jurors debates the case, we get the feeling that we know just as much as they do themselves. This film captivates the tension in the room by subtle body language and contradicting personality traits. When we first see the 12 jury member enter the room and gather around the little room Juror No. 3 says: ""It's an open and shut case"". When the first poll results come on, 11 to 1 agrees that the boy is guilty. The rest is movie history and storytelling at it's finest. One of the many factors that makes this movie work so great is the role gallery, which includes magnificent actors such as; Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, Martin Balsam.. etc. The chemistry between these actors are exquisite, it's like they where meant to be cast in the same movie. But don't misunderstand me, it's the script that bonds, splits and alienate the cast, therefor, the script should have the most praise for the great chemistry it creates in and between the actors. The Screenplay is for me the most important factor when it comes to the pre-production of a movie, and 12 Angry does it brilliantly.

The greatness of 12 Angry Men somewhere lays in this theory, times twelve. I would be at a loss to identify who is elevating whom, certainly Lee J. Cobb, Henry Fonda and Ed Beagly Sr. are among the truly greats, to single them out as the pacesetters might minimize the skills and abilities of journeymen like E.G Marshall, Jack Klugmen, Martin Balsom or Jack Warden. Obviously John Fiedler or Robert Webber are not names usually associated with the aforementioned and possibly the proof of this theory however I am reticent to apply this to them, so perfect were they in their individual numeric places.What movie aficionado can remove from memory the old man's affinity and identification with the stroke victim witness ""I believe I know this man better than any of you"", his unexpected gesture of support for the Fonda character with his ""not guilty"" verdict and subsequent explanation as to why. E.G. Marshall's perspiration as he tries to remember a second feature. The broken and silent bigot (Ed Beagly) sitting slumped over and alone. Everything Lee J. Cobb said or did: Knife in hand directed at Fonda's heart, held back by a man who is basically good but threatening still by a lifetime of mistakes and disappointments.Ninety six continuous minutes of this, one moment no greater, no lesser than the other. No actor's performance eclipsing another's. The director's skillful climactic, anticlimactic meeting on the steps of the courthouse between Davis and McCartel.

It might be old, slow and sometimes really predictable; but for a movie from 1957 it might be the first movie to ever do anything like this. If not the first; it's the first one to nail it.If you are going to sit down and watch this movie, do not expect a movie with a lot of cool movie effects, because it doesn't have any. People nowadays seem to think that a movie is slow and not good if it goes more than 2 minutes without any action. In this movie they, as mentioned earlier, proves that if the movie has a good lineup of actors, and a good manuscript/director; and set your mind to it, you start putting yourself into the mind of the actors as real people and not actors.That alone makes this better than most movies I've ever watched. 10/10",12 Angry Men

1516,theMONssTER,Simply Brilliant !!!!!,10,14 January 2015,"Pound for pound, Sidney Lumet still has the finest filmography of all the New York giants (sorry, Marty), and to think he began his features career with this brilliant character study is to blanch at the man's gifts. Set in a single jurors' room over the course of a long summer's day and evening, Reginald Rose's scenario started off as a teleplay—just as Lumet himself came from the quick-fire world of live broadcast drama. But the director seized on the technical freedoms allowed him by an ace cameraman (On the Waterfront's Boris Kaufman), ratcheting up the claustrophobia with every close-up. Often, these dozen jurors seem on the verge of blows; the movie, dealing with a murder trial, is about persuasion, but it also showcases New Yorkers' distinct talent for coexisting in tight quarters.Yet who would mind such company? Justly, 12 Angry Men is celebrated for its uniformly terrific cast, chiefly Henry Fonda's soft-spoken advocate and Lee J. Cobb's resistant blowhard, racked with daddy issues and not about to let an ungrateful teen go free. A closer look at the performances reveals a minimum of Method fussiness, the grace notes of Jack Warden's jokey baseball fan and Robert Webber's Mad Men–esque smoothy landing in quiet harmony. Meanwhile, too few films take on the art of arguing as a subject; we could certainly use more of them, but until then, Lumet's window into strained civic duty will continue to serve mightily.",12 Angry Men

Every juror plays his role well and the way the story proceeds at a brisk yet calm rate is good to see.Some of the scenes in the movie are what directors these days take inspiration from.If you are thinking of exploring old cinema and are(like me)just the fan of blockbuster cheesy movies,check this one out since it is sure to surprise you.",12 Angry Men

Once I have seen this film, I have once again realized that we should think more precisely when giving judgment.12 Angry Men (1957) made me wonder about the jury system. I have a different system in the country i live in and i still do not know which one is better but maybe there is no better system, there is only a better person.",12 Angry Men
1519,solarconcert,A great movie for newbie jury duty citizens,9,25 January 2014,"12 Angry Men: I liked this movie because it was shot in a 2 month period - one set - and everybody was on set at the same time... very real, very rare these days. Henry Fonda produced it with his own dime - Again very rare - All the actors seemed extremely real and unforgiving. The actors ability to hold the passion and hope of the jury's outcome keeps the viewer completely involved. The film shows prejudice in many forms, like having a kid of your own you don't like, or color, race, age, financial status, local/foreign connections, how people see from a distance with poor eye site, but hear what they want to. Great cast and simple photography puts this film in my top 100.",12 Angry Men

Its impact therefore in getting people to scrutinise and question evidence and opinions has had a profound effect upon the judicial system. Fondas performance as well as the brilliant supporting roles played by bigots and indifferent individuals is a wonderful snapshot of actual society. The sauna like conditions in the jury room had one almost perspiring, and the tension and anger portrayed in those scenes has never been bettered by any modern courtroom dramas since. This film should be compulsory viewing for all would be jurors",12 Angry Men
1521,nohejl-matej,Best low-budget movie of all time,9,15 February 2014,"12 Angry men is the best low-budget movie ever. This movie serves as a proof, that to make a great movie, you don't need tens of millions of dollars. The only things you need are: 1 room, 12 actors and a great script. The whole movie takes place in a jury room (2 minutes are at the court of law). That was the reason why I didn't want to watch this movie, but I can tell you, that I've been so wrong. The 12 men are, like at the actual jury, very different, which is one of the main points of this movie. They all need to agree and above all, they have to make the right decision.The one thing I don't like about this movie is, that it's breathtaking only for the first time. With every view it gets worse and worse (but that might be just fore me).",12 Angry Men

At the beginning the ballots are 11:1 for guilty, and at the end they are 12:0 for not guilty and you are convinced yourself, convinced of what? Convinced that this is a brilliant movie.At the beginning you think, how will we be introduced into the case, how will we see who committed the crime and how did he do it. After half an hour you don't care about it, you want to know how the remaining 8 people will be convinced. After one hour you want to know why the remaining four jurors are not convinced yet, and you are now, without even having noticed it introduced to at least 10 minor details of the case.

This film shows how very talented character actors can be. Every single one (especialy Cobb en Warden) are excellent! This is a wonderful and gripping film. Although the remake (with Jack Lemmon) is very good, the characters in the Lumet version are much more lifelike and help to make the story so gripping, funny and poignant. Somehow it is a shame that actors like ""The Immigrant or McCardle"" were not used more often in movies. A virtual masterclass for ensemble acting. A true movie masterpiece.",12 Angry Men
1526,hans-daba,Great Classic,9,8 April 2014,"12 Angry Men is as simple as it is profound, and as bare-boned as it is a showcase of true camera-work and directional complexity. It is as much a film about the justice system in America as it is a film about people; a film that lets the viewer into a single room for 90 minutes (the film moves forward quicker than real time) and examines the quirks, insecurities, prejudices and glaring background differences of twelve different characters.The film begins in a courtroom as a murder case is coming to a close. The judge informs the twelve jurors of their duty as though it were just another day in his life, as though the defendant (an 18-year old street kid) has already been proved guilty. In general, nobody in the film expects the potential (and probable) difficulties that the viewer anticipates externally. It is an ""open and shut case"" as the remarkable, unnamed juror (played by Lee J. Cobb) states in the first ten minutes.Of course it isn't, otherwise 12 Angry Men would be an ""open-and-shut"" film. Opening credits play over an empty room which gradually fills up as the jurors takes their seats and prepare for the ballot. Over this time, we see windows being opened, negotiations taking place and pleasantries exchanged. If these 12 men agree that the c12 Angry Men (1957) by Sidney Lumet - Unsung Filmsase presents enough evidence to show that the crime had in fact been committed, then the verdict will be guilty. But if there is any room for what the judge calls ""reasonable doubt"", then the verdict changes.Each character in this film is entirely different. It almost feels as though each has been handpicked to take part in a sort of experiment – and it very much feels like we are watching one unfold. Each man represents something unalike. With one man's decision not to conform, or at least not to believe everything that was discussed in the courtroom, 12 Angry Men erupts. Gradually, we start to understand these men; first, we are let it on some of their social backgrounds – one is an immigrant (possibly Greek or French) and one admits to have grown up in the same conditions as the young defendant. Both men should be able to relate to the defendant in many ways – for a moment, we are afforded a glimpse at the defendant's face, an immigrant from an anonymous ghetto. Strangely, both men vote ""guilty"" without hesitation.12 Angry Men (1957) by Sidney Lumet - Unsung FilmsHenry Fonda lets us in on his reason for disputing — he simply does not want to decide on a person's life in the space of five minutes. This is understandable; the viewer takes his side and so, it seems, does the filmmaker. But some of the jurors argue as though it were personal; as though the young man had slaughtered their own sons, daughters and wives. Some of the men, and most noticeably Cobb as juror no. 3, work themselves up into a blind fury.As the film goes on, it becomes evident that the case was never as clear as the jurors had announced at the beginning. For some, the more reasonable and likable characters, it had simply been a case of accepting the evidence provided without questions. For others, assumptions had been made as a result of deep-rooted prejudices and massive complexes. While many change their minds with the influence of rational thought, some characters simply get angrier and more aggressive; two characters give away their racist views and the powerful scene that runs over the final ten minutes, works to reveal so much about the most moving and brilliant character portrayal in the film.The happenings described in court unfold for a second time over the duration of 12 Angry Men. By the end, it as though we possess the same knowledge of what happened in the courtroom over the days of the trial, as the twelve men in the film. Helmed by Fonda, juror no. 8, the situation is played out again with incredible detail; every argument and theory presented to us is done so with such extreme care and passion. This is one of the film's that stay with you for a lifetime because its simplicity allows itself to be engraved in the mind, while the complexity of it demands that you make sure it is.",12 Angry Men
1527,ktjeerdsma,What is on trial,10,5 January 2010,"12 Angry Men is a film that takes place entirely in the jury room of the deliberation on a murder case. With the finest of acting, this film guides the audience through the details concerning the murder. At first, the jury box is almost overwhelmingly against the suspect. However, through unbiased questioning of by one of jurors (the only one that is truly unbiased) the audience is quickly drawn in as they realize that it is not the suspect that is on trial, but rather personal bias. This movie is sheer genius and will thrill the audience as they begin to ask questions such as what do we know and how do we know it. This is truly a great film.",12 Angry Men
1528,george-xanthidis,A timeless movie that captures the essence of filmmaking.,9,17 December 2015,"Due to the age of this movie, I was skeptical when I first approached it. I see that in some cases, movies of a certain age are held on a pedestal even though they have either been bested or have not aged well. Thankfully, this movie is neither. 12 Angry Men is a premise that is not easily done. A movie that takes place mostly in one room is not that exceptional, but 12 Angry Men is handicapped even further because we know nothing about the characters, not even their names. Nevertheless, the cinematography, writing and acting in this movie are nearly flawless, and have aged like fine wine. Having said all this, the movie is not without errors. The writing feels to be forced at some points of the movie, and the leaps in logic are sometimes hard to fully get behind. Nevertheless, 12 Angry Men is one of the best examples of how timeless a movie can be, and how limitations can help a film become a masterpiece.",12 Angry Men

To make a black and white film based solely in the confines of a small room sporting little more than a table and some chairs is a brave endeavour and this film nails it. It's a great example of how a budget doesn't have to affect a film's quality. As long as the story and the characters are there you can create a sensational film as 12 Angry Men demonstrates.

You are left asking yourself how hard is it to be truly unbiased while someone's life hangs in the balance. Are you sure what you believe is what you believe under intense scrutiny and in the presence of undeniable truth. The cast is excellent and each character is markedly different from the next which makes every bit of dialog and interaction be it verbal or non-verbal very tense at times and also suspenseful. Henry Fonda plays Juror #8. He soon becomes the ringmaster of this jury room circus. His chief antagonist will be juror # 3 played by Lee J. Cobb. These two couldn't be more polarized on the issue of guilty or not guilty. Each argument that is presented by each juror must be examined, re-examined, and proved without a reasonable doubt. Layers of the proverbial onion are peeled back until we are left with nothing but raw unadulterated truth.

Almost the entire film is located inside a hot, small jury room where the men quickly agree to take a vote before any discussion as a jury. All of the men vote guilty except for one who is played by Henry Fonda. Throughout the course of the film, Henry Fonda's character attempts to explain to his fellow jurors why he stands against them.The film's minimal location use allows it to focus entirely on the characters and the actors' performances. Even though none of the characters are given an actual name to identify them with until the end of the film, we get a good idea of what type of person each man is. There are small scenes that reveal the backstories of each of the jurors and the personalities of the men are quickly established once the debating starts. The heart and soul of the film lies in its ability to show how these very different men can come together or clash.

This movie completely changed my view on films as a whole and opened my mind up to new things that make a great movie. This movie is almost entirely shot in the jurors debate room and really does an amazing job at getting the viewer to really focus on who the characters are as people and how they would be in their day to day lives. The acting in this film is second to none and easily became my favorite movie of all time. This film proves that you don't always need hundreds of explosions and action scenes to make a good movie.

1556,vishad,A guide on how to make a film,10,15 August 2016,"It is not often that you come across a thriller movie with no action sequences that blows you away, but that's where the brilliance of screenwriter Reginald Rose comes in play. The movie is set in a single room where 12 jurors are locked until a decision is made on an apparent 'open and shut' murder case. In the process, the movie touches on several pressing issues: why it is important to question the obvious; troubling sense of priorities of men who value attending a baseball game more than the life of a man; how questioning the facts, eliminating possibilities and being unprejudiced are the necessary qualities of a decision maker. The movie brings to the table 12 men of varied characters and lays bare each one in the limited screen time through just dialogue and no use of flashbacks. Even before the debate starts, we get a sense of an impending situation of a deadlock with the clever hints of a hot afternoon, faulty air conditioning, a locked room all adding to claustrophobia. Lumet used special lenses which make the room appear smaller than it actually was and throughout the course of the film adjusted the lenses to make he room appear even smaller, adding even further to the claustrophobia. A masterful performance by Lee J Cobb playing a self righteous juror having troubles with his teenager son steals the show as he acts as a nemesis to Henry Fonda, who also gave a wonderful performance. A perfect mixture of writing, direction, camera-work and acting make this movie a masterpiece of film making.",12 Angry Men

That the director & writer(s) were able to do *so* much with just 1 room & 12 characters (except for a brief courtroom scene at the start & an occasional appearance by the bailiff) is just amazing.

1564,ashlanmacklove-41983,How being different can make a Difference (Spoiler Alert),9,15 August 2015,"It's often that many movies or readings have multiple themes, but the one I would like to focus on in this film is acceptance of being different. The term different is described as ""not the same as another or each other; unlike in nature, form, or quality"". For me growing up was a bit difficult I grew up in a straight Mexican home, I was the only mixed child (Black and Mexican) so I was forced to be different. As reflected in the movie when one juror decides to stand for a cause (voting not guilty) and in result of being different he was greeted with unpleasant responses. He more courageous than I because he had a choice, and he stood for more than himself. He was the starting factor for a movement that changed and maybe saved a life. Remember in High School, when everyone was picking their dream job and careers so many people dreamed differently then others and it was okay some wanted to be; Doctors, Lawyers, Business Owners and so fourth, in return before even accomplishing their desire they were respected. On the other hand you had the real dreamers like me, aspiring actor, models, entertainers courageously choosing a different unguided path to accomplish their dreams. In response for being different and not working a nine to five like most; We faced some of the same challenges as the juror who said not guilty did. However, this movie messages was to send its okay to be different; as long as you stand up for what you believe in thats when the quality of ones character is revealed. If we take a look history all the greats had mentors Phil Jackson to Micheal Jordan, Andy Grove to Steve Jobs, Benjamin Graham to Warren Buffet. So if you're out there being different whatever the case may be in. Keep being different, because it was the difference that will make you stand out above the rest.(MLK, Rosa Parks, John Brown, Lincoln) There might not be ribbons or awards that can show value for the qualities of leadership in that matter but there are student out there like me hungry to learn from someone like you and in the real world that is what makes a difference.",12 Angry Men
1565,rishabhlmcgupta,A must watch for those who appreciate simple but impactful cinema,9,24 August 2015,"This movie accomplishes something in the fact that the whole drama in the movie takes place in a courtroom.The story is simple but told in an interesting way. For example, the way the professions of the characters are disclosed at different intervals during the conversation.It feels as if the movie is shot in real time. The performances are great. The day is hot,which adds to the intensity and frustration of the drama in it's own way. The movie is not about right or wrong. The viewer is never told whether the boy actually killed his father or not. That is for the viewer to decide. But it definitely raises some questions on the legal system. The term 'reasonable doubt' is ambiguous. We are not shown any legal discussions in the court. While giving judgement, the judge himself seems bored yet claims the case to be complex. Juror no. 3 in the starting claims to 'almost fell asleep' during the trial while another feels 'lucky' to get a murder case, as other cases might be boring. Yet all these people except juror no. 8(Henry Fonda) vote the boy as guilty without giving a second thought. While some jurors are open to ideas and are 'reasonable', other have preconceived notions and are biased due to their personal experiences( juror no. 3 or 10).The vote which begins from 11 to 1 against the boy gradually shifts to 12 to none in favour of the boy. This itself is unsettling. The fate of a man's life is left in the hands of 12 people, who completely change their decisions in a couple of hours. The movie has been written brilliantly and beautifully performed,giving the viewers an engaging experience.",12 Angry Men
1566,gentryphillips,"""Innocent unless proved guilty"" IS a founding father principle",9,6 December 2015,"The Film ""12 Angry Men"" is an amazingly written classic film from the year 1957. This wonderfully created suspense drama is about a jury of 12 men that must come to a unanimous decision to either send an 18 year old boy to the electric chair or to let him free. The young man was placed on trial after supposed evidence was found and eye witnesses saw him murder his father with a knife. At the beginning of the jury meeting, 11 jurors immediately vote to send the boy to the electric chair, while the twelfth is simply hesitant to send the boy to his death without talking about it. Angrily and almost against their will, they discuss the murder case and all the events that take place, and slowly but surely find reasonable doubt in all aspects of the ""Evidence."" For example, 2 witnesses were brought to the court to testify against the boy. One witness saw the murder from across the street as a train was passing by, and the other was in a room below and heard the scream as someone yelled ""I'm going to kill you!"" As the Jury discussed both aspects of the witnesses, they decided that it was impossible for the witness below to hear the murder taking place as a train was going by right outside the window. As more and more doubts filled the room, one by one, the jury members started changing their votes to not guilty. Each member of the jury has a different back ground and each seem to find a personal connection to a different member within the trial. One Juror has glasses and identifies with the eye witness who also wears glasses but realizes that when she saw the murder from her bed while looking out the window, she probably wouldn't have been wearing her glasses which would have made it very difficult to see. Another Juror is a father with a bad relationship with his son. He identifies the most with the murder victim who was stabbed ""supposedly"" by his own son. He tends to be more ruthless with the young man on trial and is the very last Juror to change his vote to not guilty. I think that this strategy naturally makes the audience try to identify with one of the characters. We tend to ask ourselves, if I were in this situation, who would I be? Would I vote guilty or not guilty? We all like to think that we would be the first one to vote not guilty. Compassion wins the star role in this film. There may be many different kinds of moral statutes that the film makers lead the audience to believe, but they all tie back into this one simple concept. One of our greatest and most noble examples of compassion is the biblical reference to Jesus Christ. In some ways, this movie can be related to that seeing as the main character can be seen as a savior for the young man on trial, but because of the very real human element in the film, this is clearly the exact opposite. The first juror may have all the compassion in the world but that just simply doesn't do it justice. He must also convince his fellow 11 apostles to have this same kind of compassion which eventually saves this young boys life. Compassion is what makes the audience identify with the main character, not justice. If all 12 jurors had walked into the room, quickly voted that the evidence was good and that this boy was without a doubt the killer then it wouldn't have been in justice or ruthless in the least. After all in the minds of 12 imperfect people, this was a case where the killer was proved guilty. Granted the movie would have no plot and it wouldn't have been nominated for 3 academy awards, but it would have been just in the eyes of the legal system. So why does the audience vote for this random act of compassion? Is it just? This film has been numbered among the great drama classics in history. Not because of its amazing CGI ability to make super robots fight aliens, nor its Megan Fox type lead female role, but because of the film makers ability to creatively persuade its audience to be morally upright. We as Americans are always trying to better ourselves. It's in our blood. However, sometimes we try to focus more on the qualities that will benefit ourselves, instead of helping other people. We try to lose weight, we try to be funnier, be interesting. All of these things are great to a certain extent, but what these brilliant film writers are doing is trying to help us realize is that being American is not about us. It's about helping us to become our best selves in order to help other people. Sure, being determined, skilled compassionate, etc. can help us personally, but how can we take these personal strengths and apply them to be the best Americans we can be? The main character said it best when he announced, ""wouldn't you want someone to do the same for you if you were in his position?"" The room may have been silent, but the audience already knows the answer to that question. The ""anger"" portion of this movie is not so much anger as it is a character development struggle to become a better more compassionate individual. The argument in this film is one that we lack in today's modern cinema. If the new and upcoming film makers want to learn from history, then they need to take a blast to the past because films like these teach us to be American, be just, but more importantly, to be compassionate.",12 Angry Men
1567,aavic,One of the rare gems of classic cinema.,9,31 August 2015,"12 angry men is a courtroom drama based on the premise that all defendants deserve a fair trial until proved guilty. The film is a very simplistic take on the presumption of innocence and takes place almost entirely within a small New York City court room as 12 men debate the fate of a young defendant charged with murdering his father. In the start all jurors think of the case as an open and shut case except one; Juror No. 8 played by Henry Fonda. But as they discuss the the available evidence, it turns out it is not simple as it seems to be. Most of the jurors are prejudiced and it takes the staunch effort from the character played by Fonda to induce logic and sense into the proceedings.The film builds tension through conflict among the jurors and the dialogue. The length is only 95 minutes but it feels as if it is shot in real time. The direction and camera-work is excellent. The jurors are all well defined in terms of their personalities, occupations, prejudices and the emotional reasons behind those prejudices. All the cast members make an excellent effort into bringing these characters to life.The movie is not about solving the crime although all the available evidence is heavily discussed, it is about the jury passing a judgment on the life of a boy. It is a take on the strength of the jury and their power to decide a man's survival and it performs this job in an excellent manner. The movie is a rare gem and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves great cinema.",12 Angry Men

1569,gamingg,Good Movie,10,19 September 2015,"Juror #1 - a simple man who clearly does not understand the full complexity of the task that lies before him but is trying to do everything not to let anyone else find this out. He appears at ease only once during the film - when he talks about football. He has the misfortune to be selected foreman of the jury - a task he clearly does not relish.Juror #2 - a small, quite man, clearly unaccustomed to giving his own opinion much less to expecting his views to be of any importance. Apparently he finds solace in his job - he is an accountant.Juror #3 - probably the most complex personality in the film. Starts off like a pleasant self-made successful businessman, he analyses the case impartially, explains his arguments well and is reasonably self assured. As time goes on he becomes more and more passionate and seems to be somehow personally involved with the case. He also starts to show some signs of slight mental instability. Wonderfully played by Lee J. Cobb - this is the character you remember after the film is over.Juror #4 - self assured, slightly arrogant stockbroker. Obviously considers himself more intelligent than anyone else in the room, he approaches the case with cool heartless logic but (as one of the jurors says - ""this is not an exact science"") he does not take into account the feelings, the passions, the characters of the people involved in the case. He is conspicuous by the fact that he is the only juror that does not take his jacket off (it is a very hot day).Juror #5 - here is a man under great emotional stress. He comes from the same social background as the accused boy - with who he almost unwillingly seems to identify with. Paradoxically this appears one of the main reasons for him voting guilty - he does not want compassion to influence him - so ironically it does.Juror #6 - a simple man, quite readily admitting that everyone in the room is better qualified than he is to make decisions and offer explanations. But he really wants to see justice done and it worries him that he might make a mistake.Juror #7 - the only one that really has no opinion on this case. Literally throughout the film his thoughts are never on the case - he talks of baseball, of the heat, of fixing the fan but the only reason he has for voting this way or that is to speed things up a bit so he might be out of the jury room as soon as possible. Not an evil man he just has no sense of morality whatsoever - he can tell right from wrong but does not seem to think it's worth the bother.Juror #8- a caring man, has put more thought into the case than any of the other jurors. He tries to do his best even in the face of seemingly impossible odds.Juror #9 - a wise old man with his great life experience has quite a unique way of looking at the case.Juror #10 - the most horrifying character in the film. Votes guilty and does not even try to hide the fact that he does so only because of the boy's social background. The tragedy comes from the fact that his own social position is only a cut above the boy's - which makes him all the more eager to accentuate the difference.Juror #11 - an immigrant watchmaker, careful methodical man, well mannered and soft spoken. respects the right of people to have different opinion to his - and is willing to look at both sides of the problem. Loses his temper only once - horrified by the complete indifference of juror #7.Juror #12 - a young business type - perhaps he has his own opinions - but is careful to hide them. What he has learnt out of life seems to be that intelligence is equal with agreeing with what the majority of people think.The film succeeds in doing something very rare today - developing an intelligent plot while also developing 12 believable, memorable and distinct characters.",12 Angry Men

From this point on we have 12 actors and a closed room. This could be the most boring film ever made.

It is a plot that looks pretty simple, noting that this movie is based on a play from what I understand. What I called a lot of the movie is the atmosphere that you are given in the room, a hot day, 12 tired men and some of them want to leave as quickly as caring the sentence really. This film I liked also because it deals with quite interesting subjects: doubt, as our experience affects us in our decisions, go, subjects that look in perspective rather boring (Thinking of someone who only wants to watch a movie and not a moral debate) but that Are developed so well and subtly that you do not feel that you are giving a speech, you feel that you are watching a movie with interesting themes.I do not know what you could add in this review, is that it's so great, even if you do not like these spoken themes, I recommend it as a movie about thinking and entertainment at the same time.",12 Angry Men

A young boy 18 is accused of murdering his father, and the film starts with him in court. The judge the asked the 12 jury members to go to the jury room and decide if the boy is guilty or not guilty. And if the boy is guilty he will be sent to the chair. So the 12 men go to the jury room and all vote. Every man but 1 votes guilty. Except jury number 8. He reason for this is that he doesn't want to send a boy the death without talking about it first. He can't decide something like that in 2 minutes. So after this the 11 other jury members are angry and are telling him why the kid is guilty. And I listened to the other jury member explain why there believe the kid is guilty, I though he must be guilty they have given a lot of reasons why he is. So not only is Jury number 8 trying to change there minds he is also trying to change mine. So jury number 8 sets on giving reasons why he think the boy could be innocent. He forces on the small details, the details no one thought of before, little things that slipped peoples minds. And slowly he starts changing there minds and mine two (I mean at first I thought he is 100% guilty, but after listening to jury number 8, I now think he is not guilty). And the kid is found not guilty. This film is great because it takes place in one room, they are in the court room for the first 3 minutes. But the rest takes place in the jury room. You would think because of this it would make the film boring, but its is not. The acting is amazing, the drama is great, the story telling is wonderful. And the film being in black and white makes it so much better. This is the best film I've seen so far, and probably ever will be. ONE OF THE BEST FOR SURE.",12 Angry Men

The conflicts are real and grounded, as the collection debate the finer points of the case. In addition to illustrating wonderful storytelling, it's a great examination of the idea of what a jury is all about. What is means to determine your judgment in the case, and what defines reasonable doubt. It's a perfect illustration of what our legal system is supposed to be. Idealized, perhaps, but realistic.

Dialogue and body language are vivid and most important.3. Also the character study is one of the greatest and the most detailed. All 12 men from the title are portrayed the best possible way. Actors so in sync with their work that you completely forget you are watching a film and not a live version of a jury. You get lost in the emotions, excitement and quarreling. Each man's personalities are portrayed incredible and their range of personalities adds up to the conflict they have.4. Main theme is as the title says it all. It is about 12 angry men and how a person is biased by their own emotions and prejudices when he is required to be the most rational, objective and following the facts. As it is important for the juridical system that every detail, every fact must be took into the account before you convict someone, since it is a possibility you could send an innocent person to jail (or even to death). A matter of ethics! 5. Cinematography: sequence shot of the main one-set (jury room), minimalistic Mise-en-scene, because we need to focus on acting and words. Nimble camera movements, key and soft light, close-ups at dramatic shifts, camera moves from above-the-eye to low-angle position and at the end the ceiling is visible and it seems that it is closing the set also as the men are more and more pressured. - Stylised realism.",12 Angry Men

The movie begins at the end of the trial, where the judge solicits a unanimous decision from the jury and sends them off to discuss the case. An initial vote, reveals that eleven out of the twelve men are convinced that the boy stabbed his father to death, beyond any reasonable doubt. Only one man persists with the vote of not guilty, much to the consternation of others. His sole purpose being to have a proper debate before sending a man to his grave. The movie follows the course of the discussion, as it evolves and the evidence and testimonies are carefully scrutinized. Preconceived notions, prejudices and personal histories rise to the fore making things complicated. The movie brings out the fallacies of the jury system and at the same time questions the reliability of testimonies and other such evidence. It also preaches the virtue of standing up for what one feels and at the same time accommodating others point of view. Putting aside ones biases and examining facts objectively is shown to be a praiseworthy trait. Some brilliant acting performances and a great story-line make it an absolute must watch. The aggression and temper of Lee J. Cobb is well contrasted with the calm and open-mindedness of Juror number 8 played by Henry Fonda. The meticulous logic applied by E.G. Marshall's character, the insensitivity shown by Jack Warden's and the huffing- puffing Ed Begley are all quite believable. This short drama left me mesmerized and wanting for more.

A compelling movie to watch, 12 Angry Men showed me the importance of negotiation in our daily lives.

There is no way one can afford to miss this roller coaster of egoistical emotions. It is one of the most exquisite and flamboyant movie i have came across. Everything about this movie just sets the stage for a detailed viewing of human nature. It curtain up the adherence to ""our way"" rather than the ""right way"" for us.We are drawn toward the values attach to us, the conditions those make us go through what changed our opinions now and in a most descriptive way, movie depicts the way ego or stubbornness obstruct the rationality of a being. Another prospect of the movie is standing of one against many. As described in the movie, it is rather tough for a person to contradict the majority and this view is brilliantly showed in this movie. Its not just the crusade for human emotions but a very well staged drama for showing how people react to poverty struck people and how the prejudices about the way they put up to fixate. The simplicity and the blend of some extraordinary performances is something that movies need this movie had the backbone of. Every actor deserves a bow and the stage set for the actors, milieu for the stage is what draws you to at its best. The prevailing conditions, the personal space for every one in the jury room, everything about this movie leaves you with a tremendous interest.

The judge urges the jury to deliberate thoughtfully to come up with a unanimous verdict, which concerns the life and death of an 18- year-old boy. However, when the jurors take a preliminary vote, 11 out of 12 men already adopted their positions in favor of guilty. Juror 8 is the only one who votes ""not guilty"" because he believes the boy deserves a review of his case before the verdict is made.For a black and white movie filmed close to 60 years ago, I am impressed by 12 Angry Men, which largely revolves around that one scene in the jury's room. Despite the age of this movie, the content stands the test of time and offers insights applicable to negotiations we may have to do in our daily lives. In particular, having empathy and an open mind is the key to negotiation.This movie is an embodiment of ""old is gold"" and I recommend it to anyone ranging from young adults to even retirees to watch the movie, either as a pastime or for educational purpose.",12 Angry Men

Initially, 11 out of 12 jurors decided that the accused is guilty. Despite the movie set mainly in a room, it manages to entice me as I saw how the lone juror (Juror 8) eventually manages to convince the other jurors to vote that the accused is not guilty of murder. While I initially watch it for entertainment, I discovered many lessons to be learned from Juror 8 on negotiations, which may be applied to daily life. It is intriguing to see how Juror 8 makes use of principles to negotiate with the other jurors, to rethink their positions on the accused. He is able to focus on facts and logic, working against the other irrational, emotional, prejudiced jurors. Also, the movie did not ultimately reveal if the accused is indeed guilty or not guilty, bringing out that the issue was whether there was reasonable doubt in the guilt of the accused. As long as there is reasonable doubt to the guilt of the accused, the accused should be considered not guilty. ""Innocent until proved guilty.""",12 Angry Men
1607,semiharmagan,excellent,9,18 December 2016,"The court case provides only a framework, however. The film's greatness lies in its bringing-together of twelve different men who have never met each other before and the interaction of their characters as each man brings his own background and life experiences into the case. Thus, we have the hesitant football coach (Martin Balsam), the shy, uncertain bank clerk (John Fiedler), the aggressive call company director (Lee J. Cobb), the authoritative broker (E.G. Marshall), the self-conscious slum dweller (Jack Klugman), the solid, dependable painter (Edward Binns), the selfish salesman (Jack Warden), the calm, collected architect (Fonda), the thoughtful, observant older man (Joseph Sweeney), the racially bigoted garage owner (Ed Begley), the East European watchmaker (George Voskovec) and the beefcake advertising agent (Robert Webber) who has plenty of chat and little else.Almost the entire film takes place in just one room, the jury room, where the men have retired to consider their verdict. The viewer finds him or herself sweating it out with the jury as the heat rises, literally and metaphorically, among the men as they make their way towards their final verdict. Interestingly, the jurors (apart from two at the end) are never named. They do not need to be. Their characters speak for them.",12 Angry Men

Moreover, heated conflicts and conflict of interests amongst the jurors allows viewers to lean more about the personalities of each juror. This film forms a great example to discuss negotiation strategies, as it greatly resonates with negotiation in real life (a long winding process), and why there's an art to it. Thou the purpose of the film is not meant to determine what precisely happened on the night in question, I felt a tinge of disappointment with the various possibilities in my head.

The case was initially portrayed to be a straightforward one, in that it was believed that the accused was guilty. However, in the preliminary vote, one of the 12 jurors (Juror #8) voted ""not guilty"" on the grounds of reasonable doubt. As it was customary for trials to require a unanimous jury, the film plunges itself into further deliberation and heated debates on the defendant's guilt and the evidences raised in court. Amidst the arguments, the jurors' characters develop and the deliberation process changes the juror's votes, one by one, eventually leading to a unanimous decision of ""not guilty""- a conclusion by which the jury has found the defendant innocent on the account of a reasonable doubt. The film captivates its audience through the intense dialogues interlaced with the character's conflict of interests.",12 Angry Men
1610,leonardx-41760,12 Angry Man Review,8,11 November 2016,"""12 Angry Men"" depicts a negotiation among a jury in the 1950s in the United States. The negotiation is regarding a patricide case where the defendant will be issued the death penalty if found guilty. The play revolves around the opinions, perceptions, reason and logic of twelve different characters that are tasked with pronouncing the guilt or innocence of a 16-year-old boy accused of patricide. In his closing statement, the judge instructed the jury that a ""guilty"" verdict can only be delivered in the absence of a reasonable doubt and they had to arrive at a unanimous decision before they could present the verdict to him.Some of the notable interests identified in the course of negotiations came from Jurors #3, #7 and #10. After the jury was tied at six to six, Juror #8 brings up the the testimony of the arresting police officer and Juror #5 contests the claim that the defendant had the competency to inflict the chest wound on the deceased. As the discussion went on, Juror #7 decided to change his vote to ""break it up"" and swing it to 7 to 5 in favour of ""not guilty"" because he got jaded and was more interested in attending a baseball game in which he had tickets for. Therefore, his interest was for negotiations to end quickly. Juror #10 despised people from the slums and his attitude suggested that the defendant probably deserved the death penalty. Clouded by his prejudice against the defendant, he completely disregarded the notion of justice. In his final monologue when the jury was 11 to 1 in favour of ""not guilty"", we observe that Juror #3 was the last to ""break"". This happened only after his emotional outbursts of anger was shown from the broken relationship and hurt he felt from his own son. Therefore, his interests showed that he was confused about his position as to whether the boy deserved the death penalty as he made a call based on the personal hurt that he had experienced.In conclusion, 12 Angry Men is a classic movie which proves why the American trial-by-jury system is effective in helping the judge mete out a verdict. It showcases the great diversity in America and the several challenges it produces. Fisher also points out the importance of having various experts and professions' perspectives and opinions which will help to examine the problem.",12 Angry Men
1611,hong_jia_qi,Unexpectedly engaging movie,8,12 November 2016,"12 Angry Men is about a jury of twelve who has to unanimously decide on a verdict – one that could end the life of an 18-year-old. They are tasked to decide if the boy is guilty of stabbing his father to death and if there is any reasonable doubt, it should result in a verdict of not guilty. The movie is set in the juror's room, with arguments consuming time and causing frustration amidst the sweltering heat. Of the twelve jurors, only Juror 8 votes not guilty, incurring the wrath of the others. He then negotiates with the other jurors until eventually, all are convinced that there is reasonable doubt of the boy's guilt. Initially, I did not have much expectations about the movie, as it was in black-and-white and majority of the film was set in a single setting – the Juror's room. However, I quickly became intrigued by the movie and I found myself rooting for Juror 8 to successfully convince all to vote 'not guilty'. This was an insightful film that touched on topics such as stereotypes, race, justice and humanity. Definitely worth watching, a breath of fresh air amidst the usual action-packed movies of today.",12 Angry Men
1612,yeshasdaman,Great Movie!,9,13 November 2016,"Although 12 angry men does not explicitly show all these four aspects, the protagonist of the movie, Juror 8 applied several negotiation techniques that accommodates the needs and requirements of that individual and scenario. In most of the scenarios that he is put in and has to deal with, he makes most use of the first two aforementioned aspects, the separation of people from the problem and, focusing on the interests and not positions. At the start of the movie we see that the only Juror 8 has not been swayed or influenced due to his past conflicts or prejudices he holds. The movie shows us the true power of negotiating, one man managed to convince 11 other men who were at first staunchly against the idea of the defendant being not guilty. The main aspects of negotiation that he employs is the act of separating the people from the problems and the focus on interests. For example, we see that when Juror 8 is challenging testimonies that police officers and witnesses gave he comes across some backlash from the rest of his fellow jurors. But he keeps a calm head and steady composure despite the attacks from the rest. He also makes sure that everyone gets their equal say. If someone comes across as stubborn or just unreasonable he tries to break down their point of view by asking them questions and understanding why they think that way about the problem – i.e he is focusing on the interests of the person and not the position he is. As mentioned above, Juror 8 keeps everyone focused on topic throughout their discussion. He always finds the underlying interests and reasons behind everyone's position as well. While other jurors such as 3 and 10 kept on antagonizing people and basing their judgments from their old experiences. In fact juror 8 even takes over the job of the foreman and manages to keep everyone on topic. This movie can mostly be seen as critique on American thinking and their law system at the time. Several of the jurors just want end the discussion as soon as possible and just send the boy off to his death. But Juror 8 would scold them for not taking the discussion seriously and asking them to put themselves in the shoes of the defendant on the verge of death row. Here it is important to note that sometimes interests may be better off ignored – juror 7 wanting to go to his ball game, juror 10 rambling on some unrelated story and the two jurors who were trying to do business instead of focusing on the topic. Of course, positions need to be ignored as well. For example juror 5 was raised in a poor neighborhood and wants to be separated from that fact. He doesn't want to be labelled in that manner and be on similar social standings as the rest of the jurors. We can say that juror 5 basically embodies the aspect of interest, not position. The tactics used by juror 8 can also be analyzed quite thoroughly throughout the movie. His task of convincing 11 other people who were against him seemed like quite the insurmountable task. However, once he managed to get juror 9 to switch to his side despite the initial early criticism and attacks from the other jurors. The jurors are seen to be very easily swayed by the peers and just seem to go with the flow. Juror 8 uses this to advantage and once he got juror 9 to his side it was easy to bring more and more people to see that the non-guilty verdict. We also see that sometimes even when juror 8's argument is not very convincing. When he tries to prove that the defendant may have forgotten the name of the movie just due to some emotional stress. He tries to test juror 4 on this but juror 4 names the first film and almost gets the name of the second film. Here we see that juror 8 is now quite reliant on negotiation tactics and the evidence for the innocence of the defendant is actually decreasing and there is no massive evidence for realizing that he is truly innocent. Another interesting point that I noticed about this movie is that the BATNA – Best alternative to negotiated agreement for both groups is actually a hung jury, in fact the only option. However, juror 8 did not want this as it would put him in a disadvantageous situation so he decided on pushing for the votes and wanted to get as many people on his side as fast as he could. If the jurors who really thought the boy was guilty had just waited out, they would have reached a hung jury and probably land the defendant a guilty verdict. There are often times in our everyday life that we are negotiating with someone else. This may be talking to the cashier at a drinks stall about the wrong price being charged or to a professor asking him to shift the deadline or change a grade. From the many classes we had so far, reading Getting to Yes and watching 12 angry men, I have learnt to appreciate the importance of negotiations in our daily life and how much easier it could be made with the application of it.",12 Angry Men
1613,amandatan-08409,Very insightful play about negotiation,8,14 November 2016,"A critically acclaimed American Drama, 12 Angry Men, takes place in a jury room where 12 jurors with diverse personalities are tasked to come up with a unanimous decision as to whether the accused is guilty. Initially, Juror 8 held up the jury as he gave a ""not guilty"" verdict even though all the other eleven jurors gave a ""guilty"" verdict. This resulted in a vote count of 1-11, which was not unanimous. What started off as an open-and-shut homicide trial soon became a negotiation story where Juror 8 was able to skillfully negotiate and, against all odds, turn the tides around to influence all other eleven jurors to give a ""non-guilty"" vote.Even though this movie was in black and white and filmed in one room, it was extremely engaging and insightful because of the principled negotiation skills of Juror 8 and the short excerpts of humour intercepted into the movie. It was also interesting to see how Juror 8 managed to one- handedly move all the jurors from positional negotiation to a principled one, and did not succumb to the pressure of changing his vote so that they can arrive at a unanimous vote quickly. As the saying goes, ""Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate."" Juror 8 truly exemplifies this saying and I have definitely learnt more about negotiation from him.",12 Angry Men

However, the court case just sets the context. The highlight of this film is the negotiation process.Each of the characters are well-developed, with their individual personalities and backgrounds. Initially, the vote was 11:1 in favour of guilty and the audience can feel the discomfort of juror #8 who voted otherwise. The tension in the room grows as emotions escalate and things get heated up. Each juror has their own prejudices and interests, and these are revealed as the deliberation goes on. The interaction between the jurors, as well as how juror #8 skillfully influences his other jurors to reconsider their previous positions, gives us some insights on what affects our decisions as well as some tips on effective negotiation.The excellent dialogue and cast kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the film.

As it started I have to be honest I wasn't paying much attention first but as the movie progressed I kind of got engaged to the whole argument the men were having from that point I got sucked in to the film. I like the way it is viewed as a first person while making the experience more interactive. I fear I might as well never see a film as spotless as this one as we modern viewers like to point out mistakes, goofs or spoofs but this movie is pretty close to perfection totally recommend to anyone who likes to see cinema from a whole new perspective.",12 Angry Men

1624,brendickwee,Useful negotiation skills learn from this movie!,8,12 March 2017,"I will definitely recommend this movie to my family and friends. This movie shows viewers the skills of negotiation and convincing people. One scene which I found really useful for learning was how Juror 9 pointed out the truth that the lady (eye-witness) wore spectacles and how this fact of her wearing spectacles managed to convince Juror 4 to vote ""not guilty"". This is similar to the point in the book ""Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In"" by Roger Fisher and William Ury about insisting on using objective criteria to solve a problem. Openness is encouraged and players are urged to surrender to principle and not pressure. Objective criteria can be scientific findings which for this case was how Juror 9 used reasoning, thinking and evidence to deduce that the lady wore spectacles. This form of objective criteria managed to convince Juror 4 to sway to his side. The film is very insightful on how to manage difficult people in discussions and many aspiring leaders should watch this film.",12 Angry Men
1625,tanjh-15907,Ahead of its time,9,18 March 2017,"A black-and-white film released in 1957, 12 Angry Men was nevertheless one that can captivate its modern audience despite the fact that the entirety of the film was practically shot in a Jury room and consisted of just dialogues. Yet, it may be precisely on this ground that it was able to illustrate clearly to the audience the importance of overcoming our implicit prejudices to arrive at a successful negotiation. Without dictating any Jurors to take up an extreme 'bad guy' role (these are characters and personalities that we often see in our everyday lives), the film further attempts to draw parallels from the Jury room to the real world through urging us to reflect on our prejudices as we go through the hum-drums of our everyday lives.",12 Angry Men
1626,danielng-51800,Excellent movie,9,20 March 2017,"12 Angry Men (1957) is an exceptional black and white film that highlights the power of negotiation and persuasion. The film tells the story of a jury made up of 12 men as they deliberate over the fate of a defendant of a criminal case. The jury are to make a unanimous decision as to whether the defendant is guilty of murder, or not. With the jury made up of a diverse mix of personalities, the film builds up on this mix and illustrates the difficulties faced during a decision-making process. Some jury members are rash and hot-headed, some are rationale and level-headed and some are meek and fickle-minded. The jury starts off with 11 of them voting guilty, and one voting not guilty. Watch as the film unfolds and the juror's start changing their votes to not guilty after much reasoning and logic. This film is certainly enjoyable and relatable to watch because it can be adapted into our individual lives. Most of us have encountered situations where we had to decide together amongst others with varied personalities. Thus, the film showcases the intricacies of a negotiation and the lessons we can learn from it.",12 Angry Men
1627,muhdnuraliff,Quintessential negotiation skills,8,21 March 2017,"12 Angry Men is a play about 12 male jurors being confined to a jury room as they seek to reach an unanimous decision on the guilt/innocence of a boy accused of murdering his father. After deliberation, their initial stance is overturned as they eventually decide on the accused being innocent. This underscores the protagonist's negotiation skills, which illustrates teachings espoused in Getting to Yes (Fisher, Patton & Ury, 1987), one of the more important ones being discerning between one's interest from position and focusing on the former when negotiating. Fisher et al. highlight how this effectively makes it possible to find a solution satisfying both parties' interests and prevents negotiation from being a zero-sum game. The danger of position-driven negotiations is exemplified by #1. Although he asks everyone to explain why they had voted 'guilty', this is done not with the aim of establishing an objective set of criteria to solve the issue but rather to ""show #8 where he is mixed up"". Guided by his position and aim of proving #8 wrong, he then influences the majority to engages in the discussion with a specific purpose, as opposed to actively listening hoping to satisfy the shared interests of the jury. Resultantly, this hinders the construction of an open discussion where jurors are able to understand each other's perspective and underlying interests, as they are clouded by the immediate objective of defending their position.",12 Angry Men

1629,wongjw-04008,"The film ""12 Angry Men"" illuminates the jury's deliberations in a murder trial against an eighteen-year-old teenager who was accused of killing his father.",8,24 March 2017,"The film portrayed the difficulty in getting all twelve jurors, with diverse social backgrounds and vastly different personalities, to reach an eventual unanimous agreement of 'not guilty'. It explores the psychological dynamics and interplay of the twelve jurors as they decide the fate of the accused teenager, where a guilty verdict means an irreversible death sentence. The cooperativeness between different groups of people is key to an effective communication. The best possible solution is often the result of the appropriation of different perspectives rather than protecting one. Acknowledging how an individual's perception might be influenced by prejudice, pressures of the majority and various vested interests, we should avoid cementing ourselves in a position that is resistant to change. Hearing from others is no less important than justifying our stand in any issue. Hence, the challenge here lies in how we are able to integrate diverse perspectives into effective and cooperative communities.A film that takes on various twists and turns. Various learning points can be gleaned from the different personas represented. Highly recommended for people who are interested in learning the way of an effective communication through principled negotiation.",12 Angry Men
1630,hannahtwoon,"Communication, Understanding and Respect as Key",9,24 March 2017,"12 men debating over the fate of a boy who was suspected of killing his father. 12 different personalities and an array of interests, the debates portrayed the importance of listening, understanding, respect and empathy. It is vital we disentangle perceptions and emotions from the problem. As perceptions are shaped by varied experiences and values, an array of perceptions is undeniable in any negotiation. However, allowing perceptions to determine our views on the problem at hand is detrimental as it not only leads to an obscuration of truth, but also an inaccurate basis upon which we make a decision. For example, Juror 10, with his preconceived prejudices against slum-dwellers as a result of his experience living among them, voted ""Guilty"". This prejudice undeniably resulted in a biased view, ignoring the fact that experiences are varied and more crucially, doing no justice to the boy. This is further compounded when his prejudice was taken as a personal attack by Juror 5 who lived in a slum before, engendering a flurry of emotions. In this regard, it is evident that perceptions and emotions are intricately entwined and it is crucial that we attack the problem, not the people (Fisher and Ury, 2012). In light of varied perceptions, it is important that interests of individuals are made explicit. This is so as when we begin to ask ""WHY?"", inaccurate perceptions and selfish interests could be teased out, allowing us to see how each side has multiple interests. For example, within the ""Guilty"" side, a range of interests was noticed – where Juror 7's interest lied in wanting to ""get out of here"", while Juror 3's problematic interest stemmed from his strained relationship with his son. Insodoing, we would be able to correct inaccurate and biased perceptions, while respecting and understanding the basic concerns of others. At the core of it, clear communication and active listening of interests, alongside values of respect and empathy, are crucial in ensuring efficiency and an improvement or maintenance of relationships.",12 Angry Men

1632,temporarilyinspired,12 Angry Men is a film about 12 men on a jury having to make a unanimous decision of whether the defendant is guilty or not for murdering his father.,7,24 March 2017,"Many aspects of negotiation can be seen in the film, such as having opposing opinions which cause conflicts to arise, and as a result, being unable to reach a consensus in the beginning. With reference to Roger Fisher and William Ury's ""Getting To Yes"", we are able to see some of their principles of negotiation being employed in the film. More specifically, we can identify 3 major themes that are good principles of negotiation and are portrayed throughout the film. These themes are focusing on people, dealing with interests instead of positions and using objective standards to negotiate their stands. The most apparent example of focusing on people instead of the problem is the approach that Juror 8 takes in the discussion among the jurors. Juror 8 tries to understand the different perspectives of each juror. He encourages each of the other 11 jurors to vocalize their reasons for voting guilty. This allowed everyone to participate in the decision-making process, with everyone being aware of each other's viewpoint. By doing this, he was able to step into each juror's shoes and view the case from their perspective. This gave him the ability to identify any inconsistencies or fallacies in their beliefs that the defendant was guilty. For example, he convinced Juror 4 to change his vote to ""not guilty"" by demonstrating that Juror 4 himself would not be able to remember what movie he watched in great detail, much less the defendant who was under considerable stress then. Understanding each stakeholder's perspective in the decision making process is critical to coming to a collective, informed decision. Furthermore, Juror 8 constantly tries to manage the emotions and encourage objective communication between the jurors. Juror 8 understood that many of the jurors were emotionally involved due to various personal reasons, and the sweltering heat did little to help ease the tension that was rising in the room. Some of the jurors were impatient and agitated, with some of them occasionally flaring up when they lost their tempers. Juror 8 recognized these emotions and allowed them to vent their frustration while he maintained his composure and refrained from reacting to their emotional outbursts. For instance, he allowed Juror 3 to express his frustrations without interrupting him, and this eventually led to Juror 3 realizing his own biasedness due to his anger towards his son. The open communication as the deliberation progressed helped in creating more effective discussion, which led to less misunderstanding and a more informed decision. The foreman of the jury also encouraged the jurors to listen actively and acknowledge the opinions of the others, creating a healthy environment where people could share their opinions and the reasons for taking a ""guilty"" or ""not guilty"" stand. In the film, we can see Juror 8 making an effort to understand the interests of the different jurors. Each juror was asked to share his opinion to allow everyone to understand their interests, so that the jury could come to an informed decision. Initially, all but Juror 8 hastily jumped to the conclusion that the defendant was guilty of murdering his father. Understanding the interests of the other jurors helped Juror 8 come up with arguments that tackled the problem from each juror's perspective. We can apply the concept of ""being concrete but flexible"" proposed by Ury and Fisher, where we should treat opinions that we formulate as simply illustrative, with the final decisions being made later. Juror 8 was hard on the problem but soft on the people, giving positive support to the jurors' opinions equal in strength to the vigor that we emphasize the problem with. Reaching a decision that is undisputed can be achieved when all parties involved in the decision-making process view the process as respectful and fair. At the end of the film, the jury comes to a unanimous decision that is respected by every juror because Juror 8 successfully plants a seed of doubt in every other juror.In the film, we can also see that the basis of the arguments for ""not guilty"" were objective, rather than being based on individuals' subjective reasoning. This can be seen when Juror 8 challenges the validity of the eyewitness testimonies presented to them. Juror 8 astutely points out flaws in the claims made by the 2 eyewitnesses. He utilizes objective measures to analyze the given evidence to sway the few jurors who were convinced that the defendant was guilty based on the eyewitness accounts alone. For example, he proves that the old man would never have been able to reach the door in the time that he claimed he did by making use of the floor plan of his apartment. As such, all the jurors were able to engage in an objective reanalysis of the evidence and individually challenge their own opinions. There was also a focus on the facts of the case, rather than emotions of the individual jurors, which made the decision making more objective and the final decision more accurate. Using objective standards is an effective way in making sure that the discussion is conducted in a fair and unbiased manner. In conclusion, throughout the film of 12 Angry Men, we can see the principles of negotiation from Ury and Fisher's ""Getting To Yes"". A negotiation that started out as hostile and focused on attacking the person, developed into one that focused on the objective facts and evidence of the case, and where people's interests and opinions were understood. Despite not knowing whether the defendant was guilty, Juror 8 manages to convince the other 11 jurors that there was reasonable doubt and this led to the unanimous verdict of ""not guilty"".",12 Angry Men
1633,leow-47731,Importance of Applying Negotiation Skills,8,25 March 2017,"This movie shows twelve men, serving as a panel of juror on a case of a boy charged with murder of his father. The twelve men had to make an unanimous decision by voting to decide the verdict of the 10-year old boy. 11 out of 12 voted that the accused was guilty but Juror 8 voted otherwise.The vote by Juror 8 stirred unhappiness among others as he was the only one who voted the accused not guilty. When pursued by others to explain his choice, he strongly believed that the boy might be innocent and should be given the benefit of doubt. The life of the boy lies in the hands of the 12 jurors and it should not be taken too lightly. Juror 8 felt and wanted to have a discussion over the case and to reconsider the evidence presented in court.Through several discussions using principled negotiations, and proving that the evidence were flawed, Juror 8 managed to turn the table and convince all the other jurors to vote otherwise - accused voted not guilty of the murder. He felt that there was reasonable doubt not to convict the boy guilty and his determination had served to prove that it is important to separate the people from the problems by eliminating emotions. Throughout the movie, there were several quarrels and exchange of words during the discussions but Juror 8 kept his mind cool and stayed calm, handling the situation well by not letting other jurors to put him down.",12 Angry Men
1634,randz-91492,Good display of negotiation techniques,9,25 March 2017,"12 Angry Men is a classic example of an effective case of negotiation. The movie tells a story about 12 juries deliberating a decision of either ""Guilty"" or ""Not guilty"" regarding a child defendant who is accused of murdering his father. Juror 8 starts the whole negotiation process by voting ""Not guilty"" due to his reasonable doubt and requesting the room to deliberate their decision before sending the defendant to the chair. The movie illustrates good negotiation practices and tactics that eventually led to a dramatic change of votes from 11-1 in favor of ""Guilty"" to a unanimous ""Not guilty"" by the end of the negotiation. I will write a review on ""12 Angry Men"" with reference to Roger Fisher's (1987) ""Getting to Yes"" and his four principles: separating people from problem (People), focus on interest rather than positions (Interest), generate variety of options before settling on an agreement (Options) and using the agreement made based on objective criteria (Criteria).Fisher (1987) elaborates his principle on ""People"" by exploring three different factors that prevent a successful negotiation: perception, emotions and communication. The movie aptly illustrates this ""People"" issue with regards to perception and emotions. Perception often proves to be the main problem during a negotiation process as people's past experiences may affect their way of thinking which then affect their decisions. In the movie, Juror 10 blatantly condemns the poor people living in slums and he negatively stereotypes them by claiming that ""these people are born to lie"", ""they don't need any excuse to kill someone"" and ""human life doesn't mean as much to them as it is to us"". Eventually, the rest of the jury turned their back on him and at that moment, he realized that he has let his negative perception took over him and therefore, is unfit to be a juror of a court.The other factor that affects a negotiation is emotions. As Fisher (1987) puts it: ""In a negotiation, particularly in a bitter dispute, feelings may be more important than talk"". People often respond with anger or fear when they feel threatened and excessive emotions will cloud their judgment leading to greater conflict or bad decisions. One clear example is Juror 3 who is very emotional about the case as his relationship with his child caused him to declare that misbehaved children must be taught a lesson. He then turns a blind eye against all the logical explanations that the room has presented. Eventually, he breaks down at the end of the movie to finally give in to his reasoning and to acknowledge his flawed reasoning due to his emotions.As I mentioned at the start of the review, as a classic, this movie is one of my favorite movie of negotiation and it displays all the essential elements of negotiation very well.",12 Angry Men
1635,bryanng-18958,A show portraying the difficulties of negotiations between different parties.,9,26 March 2017,"Despite being filmed entirely in a room, 12 Angry Men succinctly portrays the difficulties and the different dynamics involved in reaching consensus between individuals with a range of personalities. The movie involves 12 jurors, having to decide on a unanimous decision if the defendant is guilty of stabbing his father to death. Mirroring some of the negotiations techniques as exemplified in Roger Fisher's and William Ury's ""Getting To Yes"", the film shows how such techniques could be used to achieve a common understanding and decision. In this review, I will seek to explore three of the good principles of negotiations according to Fisher and Ury and how they are utilized in the film, namely focusing on interests, separating the people from the problem and the use of an objective standard to negotiate. Initially, upon settling down in the discussion room, all but one juror, juror 8, jumped to the conclusion that the defendant was guilty for murdering his father without much discussion. Since the decision had to be unanimous between the jurors, they had to negotiate with each other to find out about their respective viewpoints. In these first few scenes of the film, negotiating through the emphasis on the interest of the different parties was clearly exemplified where Juror 8 suggested that each juror could present their opinion and evidences on why each of them felt that the defendant was guilty. In doing so, the interests of the different jurors could be better understood. In this round the table discussion, the idea of ""Being hard on the problem and soft on the people"" was clearly reflected where Juror 8 committed himself to his interest of achieving a fair and just verdict for the defendant and thus, strongly advocated his interest by constantly created opportunities for constructive discussions to occur between jurors. By targeting the problem and not the rest of the jurors, the rest of the jurors did not feel threatened and hence, was more willing to listen to what each other had to say about the case, which further led to more constructive discussions. An extension to this idea would be ""placing the problem before the answer"". After hearing each of the juror's perspective on the evidence present in the case, Juror 8 questioned the validity of some of the evidence raised before giving objective reasons on why some of these evidences may not be as foolproof as some may think. As such, he successfully justifies his reasons for why he feels that the defendant could be potentially not guilty.",12 Angry Men

From emotionally exposing arguments to logically sound conversation, 12 Angry Men takes the cake on what a perfect script of dialogue embodies.The reason I rate this film a 10 out of 10 is due to the ease and simplicity of production with such a complex and engaging outcome. For 1957, you can't really throw a more entertaining dialogue in front of a viewer.The ethical challenge in this story defines the underdogs tale to find truth, and not only find it, but pursue it in the wake of hostility and doubt. As a young boys life hangs by a thread on the word ""guilty,"" one man stands by his own heartfelt intuition and eventually he brings truth to triumph over a ""sadists"" aggression that has been tied to longstanding personal sorrow.

When a movie that merely displays a couple of people sitting in a room talking to one another can have you on the edge of your seat, then it's surely doing something right. However, recently my opinion on the movie changed. Why, you may ask? Because it makes no sense legally. The film is about a jury that has to decide whether there is evidence of a murder beyond a reasonable doubt, which means exactly what it implies. There has to be a reasonable doubt for them not to convict the person, not absence of any doubt at all. Evidence is almost never 100% confirmatory, fingerprints or DNA don't say anyting definitive and witnesses can lie. But when there is a lot of evidence and all of it is pointing in one direction (as is the case in the movie), then the standard of reasonable doubt has surely been reached. This movie makes no legal sense and has been misinforming people on the way the law works for decades now.

1649,sarenacpavle,"One room, no color, and one of the best movies I have ever seen",10,14 April 2020,"Simplicity. Despite the setting and a lack of modern video editing skills, this movie manages to keep me on my toes from the beginning until the end. I think that this movie conveys many wise messages through the remarks of the jurors.It's fascinating to me how a variety of different character traits are portrayed in these jurors, so I'll write my view of the most influential people presented in the movie.Juror #8 - The protagonist of this movie, and the wisest person in the room. I learned a very valuable lesson from him, which is to always leave room for a reasonable doubt whenever I try to think independently about anything in life really. He is a true example of a smart, calm individual who acknowledges the fallibility of a human and therefore knows that witnesses' statements need to be questioned, especially in a situation where a young man's life depends on it. He is also articulate and very respectful of others, and that's why he became my role model for having a constructive argument with people. Another thing that strikes me is that he is able to defend his original opinion despite the fact that 11 people in the room disagreed with him. He didn't succumb to the pressure and just blindly follow the crowd. Instead, he showed us how we should behave, especially in today's world where manipulation is dangerously easy with social media and other technologies. I think he was able to do this because he values his own morality more than anything else, which is another reason why I consider him a very good person that I want to aspire to be.Juror #4 - The perfect antagonist. He is presented as a man that doesn't sweat which indicates his extreme level-headedness that is very useful in their situation. He is the only person who had reasonable arguments to back up his vote for ""guilty"". He thought that the kid was guilty until the very end when he changed his mind after being convinced by the counterarguments presented by other jurors. That was when he realized that there is a lot of reasonable doubt in the case and that a person mustn't be hung when there are so many unclear evidences. I respect him because he was respectful to others and always articulated his opinions logically which helped create a satisfying debate.Juror #3 - Inherently not a bad person, and I'll explain why. He is very prejudiced about this case because of his terrible relationship with his son that made him think subconsciously that all kids are bad. He's actually deeply scarred because of this bad relationship and that's why he tries to present himself as a strong, confident, and loud person. He is also very emotionally unstable as he shows many times, and even admits himself. It's in the end that he shows who he really is - a vulnerable man that still mourns his family relationship. He experiences a breakdown and starts crying while changing his vote to ""not guilty"" which shows that he finally realized the flaw in his prejudiced thinking. This is the reason why I don't consider him a bad person, but just a person that has gone through rough times which influenced his subconscious.Juror #10 - He was obviously raised improperly which is why he grew into a racist, terrible human being that is full of hatred. Along with being a bad person, he also proves to be unintelligent to say the least. He repeats the same few sentences throughout the film, interrupts other people constantly, and never brings anything constructive to the debate. He is a true example of a shallow person that doesn't deserve anything good in life. Even though I developed despise toward this character, I think it's very useful to be encountered with this juror in the movie because he is a good reminder that people like him exist in the real world and that I should stay away from them.Juror #7 - Along with juror #10, he is the worst person in the room. He is so selfish that he prioritizes his entertainment at a sports game over the conversation that will decide whether the boy is going to live or die. He acts this way throughout the debate and shows his stupidity and shallowness by his various acts. He was just so annoying to me that I had to write a special paragraph to recognize what I should never become.Other jurors are all good people in my opinion and they were all slowly realizing the complexity of the case and why it's necessary to discuss it deeply. They are all different of course, but I don't feel like it's necessary to write about any of them after discussing the juror #8 who encapsulates all the good traits that can be found in these other jurors.To conclude, this is one of the best movies that I've ever seen because of its meaningful messages and I would recommend it to everyone who loves to think deeply about life.",12 Angry Men

1656,itsmearjav,Surprisingly Engaging,8,3 June 2019,"As my review title suggests, this film was surprisingly engaging. Knowing the premise going in, I expected to get bored fairly early on, but boy was I wrong. The movie had my attention from start to finish, even when the characters were going around doing seemingly inconsequential things.
Speaking of which, I really enjoyed how these small inconsequential things really helped develop the characters. There's only so much you can do in terms of solid character development when you have such a limited setting both physically and time-wise, but because of all the little things the characters were portrayed doing from the get-go, I felt like I could get a genuine feel for each of the jurors, which helped justify their major actions throughout the film.
On the topic of detail, I'm sure this isn't very important but for some reason I absolutely loved how the men got progressively sweatier and sweatier as the film progressed. And no, I don't have a sweat fetish. I just enjoyed how the sweat was used to build the atmosphere of the film. I mean sure, you can have the characters go on and on about the weather, but a detail like the amount of the sweat on their faces really helps solidify that atmosphere. I could feel the men's frustration at their situation better by seeing the sweat dripping down their faces and from the stains on their shirt. I don't know, maybe I'm overanalyzing the situation, but that's something I quite enjoyed.
I also feel the need to mention how much I appreciated Jurors 4 and 11. Juror 4 gave the ""negative side"" a logical argument, which, to me, really strengthened the film. Too often the ""negative side"" in films like this are completely irrational and awful. Juror 4 helped keep the arguments in the film from going completely off the rails. Juror 11 was such a burst of sunshine. Dang, I loved him. He was hilarious and provided a nice sense of humor to the film when it started to get too tense for too long. Sometimes the message the filmmakers were trying to send through Juror 11 about immigrants felt a little heavyhanded, but overall, I loved that character.
Although I mentioned how that message felt a little heavyhanded at times, it was very pleasant to see the film give a message about the risks of racism and racial profiling.
The flow of the script was remarkable. It managed to go from plot point to plot point while maintaining a realistic semblance of what such a group of men would be like in real life. I especially enjoyed it when certain jurors were baited into saying completely contradictory things in a completely natural flow of dialogue.
I really didn't think that I'd be saying this, but after watching the film, I've come to appreciate the premise of the film as a whole. It was definitely experimental, definitely novel, but that experimentalness definitely paid off. I mean seriously, who would think to make a movie with the setting of a single room in which a jury decides, after being presented the case off screen, whether the accused is guilty or not? And seriously, to be able to pull that off without the film getting stuffy at times and feeling claustrophobic? That's some insane stuff right there.
But, as you can see, this film did not receive 10 stars; it wasn't perfect. First of all, despite what I just said about liking the novelty of the premise, it just felt a little too stretched at times. Am I supposed to believe that the lawyer, however unmotivated, missed all that contradictory information and problematic evidence in court? If that were to actually happen, it would be very, very concerning. Also I couldn't tell if and if, then what, message the movie was trying to send about the state of the American judicial system. I feel like it was, but it was just presented as a half-baked idea.
Also the whole gig with Juror 3. I understand that his stance during the entire movie was due to his complicated relationship with his own son, and I think that's a very interesting motivation for his actions. But I just felt like the resolution of his opposition at the very end of the movie was a little too hasty.
And that's about it. Would definitely recommend this movie.",12 Angry Men

When the show ended I was more upset that it was a cliffhanger ending. I was initially a bit hesitant because of the picture quality and it being black and white. Also, the idea of centering an entire moving around a single jury meeting seemed trivial to me. But seeing how the group of men interacted with one another - their different histories, personalities, agendas, and attitudes coming into this jury discussion - was extremely refreshing and revealed many truths in the human psyche. One wanted to get it done over and quickly because he had a football game to catch, another because he didn't want to let go of the prosecuted, even if there was a chance he was not guilty. And the lone architect who was super careful and always ""did not have a reasonable doubt"" that the boy was guilty. Overall, I was captured by his persistence and uprightness, sticking to his beliefs and being successful in changing an 1-11 vote to 12-0 vote, with everyone not being sure within a reasonable doubt that the boy was guilty of the murder.

1663,teojenmin,Movie Review of 12 Angry Men,8,12 October 2017,"12 Angry Men is an intriguing movie which I highly recommend watching. It displays the multi-faceted nature of human deliberation and the power of persuasion. The movie starts in a courtroom where the judge directs a jury to decide on the guilt of an accused person. The movie is set in a small room, where the 12 jurors from various professions are seated around a table. In order to sentence the boy to death, there must be a unanimous verdict of 'guilty' among all the jurors. If there is any reasonable doubt among the jury, they are to deliver a sentence of 'not guilty'. Strong contemporaneous evidence pointed towards the guilt of the boy as there were several eyewitnesses and the Prosecution was able to adduce strong evidence supporting a finding of guilt. When the movie began, 11 of the jurymen raised their hands for a vote of 'guilty'. Only juror 8 voted 'not guilty' as he was convinced that there was reasonable doubt regarding the guilt of the accused. The jury begin to debate and discuss their views on why they perceive the accused to be guilty. After juror 8 cast doubt on their decisions, he called for a secret vote. From the secret vote, the plot progresses and we see how the various jurors begin to change their position as reasonable doubt is cast. I like how the director of the movie reveals key information regarding the crime throughout the movie which affects the jury's deliberation but also simultaneously creates an aura of mystery and uncertainty about the actual evidence of the crime. This movie does not disappoint as the intensity and sheer thought into the development of the script provides a compelling and engaging plot for all viewers. It also reveals how humans are intrinsically flawed as we all have prejudices, but there are situations where such prejudice needs to be set aside to achieve justice. The courage of a single juror to stand up against opposing views is laudable and was the key to making an impactful and significant change in someone else's life.",12 Angry Men
1664,freimanisroberts,Unique,9,14 October 2017,"''12 Angry Men'' is one of the oldest movies I've watched, and whilst not being the most avid movie watcher myself I do appreciate a lot of the details. *The rest of the review will contain spoilers so I suggest watching the movie first and coming back to this review later*PLOT:''12 Angry Men'' takes place in court where an 18 year old boy has been accused of murdering his father, the judge leaves the trial of the boys life in the hands of 12 jurors. If the boy is deemed guilty he shall be executed, If not the boy shall be set free, but there is one condition : All 12 jurors must vote unanimously. The 12 jurors are then escorted into a room where they are locked in until they finish voting, they are allowed to ask for anything they like (evidence, murder details etc.) whilst in the room. The jurors sat down in order (1-12) and they began the judgment with a vote all of the jurors but one (juror 8) voted on guilty, and since the vote had to be unanimous they had to debate until they reached an agreement. INTERESTING FACTS:1. The movie almost entirely takes place in a single room. 2. None of the cast members are alive today. 3. Juror #10 never utters a single word after he is told to shut up and listen 4. Juror #1 never spoke his opinion on the guilt of the boy most likely due to him playing the role of an observer rather than being an active participant himself.REVIEW:I loved the movie to no end but that does not mean I'm going to be biased, in fact some of the flaws this movie has really do bug me. I'll start off with the good. The movie is very thought provoking and it shows how taking a bit of time and thinking through everything can lead to a different result rather than recklessly deciding on an answer in mere seconds. The movie itself is really engaging because it takes time between arguments so the audience can think on whose side they are at all times. All of the jurors have moments where they develop themselves as a character, revealing their past, life, job which develops them as a character and lets the viewer connect with them. Even though juror #8 said that he is neutral multiple times, I can't bring myself to believe that as he went to great lengths to vindicate the boy's name which was shown in the scene where he went to the slumps and got the exact knife that was in the murder scene. I believe that he truly wished for the boy to be saved and in the end he did so. My biggest gripe with the film was how some evidence and things the jurors said seemed way too convenient e.g. They saw marks from glasses on the nose of one witness or when juror #3 said that he will kill juror #8. I'm not saying it can't happen it's just that it's highly unlikely. I also disliked that some jurors where quite unprofessional, granted I do understand that they are only human, but their job requires that emotions do not get in the way and cloud the facts.All in all the movie was good even with its flaws it was a great watch. I loved how as juror #8 convinced others of the boy not being guilty they came in with their own knowledge on certain subjects and didn't regurgitate what #8 had said. I give this movie a solid 9/10 and I recommend it to anyone who wants a high tension movie that will have you on the edge of your seat. Also keep in mind that this movie slightly differs from regular detective movies but that's exactly what makes it so entertaining.",12 Angry Men
1665,alienjeux,"Twelve jurors are tasked to decide the fate of a boy accused of murdering his father. All are certain that the boy is guilty, except the protagonist, juror no. 8.",8,30 October 2017,"For a black and white movie set almost entirely in one room, I enjoyed the movie much more than I expected. Although the plot of the narrative is quite straightforward, the movie manages to create tension and suspense with the impactful and precisely scripted dialogues. Furthermore, the movie explores deep issues such as prejudice and justice system, creating a lasting impact on the audience.A motif that surfaces in the film is how prejudice blinds people. In fact, the prejudice of the antagonists is so repugnantly portrayed that the audience would find themselves compelled to support the protagonist. The story begins with a short but crucial introduction of each character's personality. In their small talks before the deliberation of the case, juror no. 3's hidden bias towards adolescents is hinted in his lines: ""I'd slap those tough kids down before they start any trouble."" It is later revealed that his prejudice had stemmed from a tormenting relationship with his son, causing him to project a sadistic attitude towards the youthful defendant. Likewise, juror no. 10's eager to convict the defendant is explicitly fueled by racism, seeing Spanish-Americans as ""born liars"" who cannot be trusted. Due to their prejudices, they were unable to make rational and objective judgments and closed their minds to any alternative interpretations of the case.12 Angry Men runs parallel with To Kill a Mockingbird in several aspects. Both are black and white films, courtroom dramas and addresses the issues of racism. While 12 Angry Men is an interesting movie, I find To Kill a Mockingbird more poignant and having more depth in portraying racial discrimination.",12 Angry Men

There is a disagreement between parties, positions seem resolute, and the chance of resolving the conflict seems improbable. As viewers, we naturally adopt such a perspective as it seems it will be futile for 8th juror to go against the overwhelming majority supporting the death sentence for the accused teenager whom allegedly ""stabbed his own father"". However, we soon realise that, the 'improbable' may, in fact, be very much probable towards the end of the film (eventually with everyone siding with the view of the minority 8th juror). Whilst one may brush this as ""movie magic"" or ""Hollywood reality"", the 8th juror's manoeuvre is indeed grounded in sound 'negotiation' principles. This simple yet intellectually stimulating drama is a reminder of the importance of open, honest conversations, and the infallibility of having empathy in any tough conversation.

In reality, some discussion or negotiation has to be done to reach a favorable decision because in a situation with multiple stakeholders, different stakeholders will have different personal interests they wish to hold onto or achieve. Hence, i felt that this movie was very relevant to the situations we may face in reality. If no negotiation is done, those who make biased decisions may possibly jeopardize the entire situation or cause losses to others, which in this case, was the life of a teenage boy. The way the movie evolves from 11-1 in favor of guilty to 11-1 in favor of acquittal was very interesting as the points brought up by jury 8 was unexpected because it was so detailed and specific.

Initially, I was not very keen on starting mainly because it was a black-and- white film. Yes, I know that there are many great black- and-white classics out there that are far better than most films produced these days. But as a young adult that grew up with some great cinematic films such as The Lord of the Rings and Back to the Future to the entire Marvel Universe series in recent years, I was ignorant to think that this film is going to be boring.Never had I been so wrong in my judgement.12 Angry Men is an amazing film that I now praise not because I want to ride on the bandwagon culture and pretend that I am cool for knowing, watching, and appreciating an old film. This film had drawn me into the conversation as if I was truly there listening. At times when some arguments become personal and ridiculous, I felt frustrations towards their stupidity (for lack of a better word). Hence, I feel that the camera was like the my eyes as if I were really in the room with them.The most intense portion was emotional and not physical. This film does not include a fast-paced adrenaline-filled hot pursuit, grand battles or explosions. However, it comes with in-depth character developments, story progressions and a showcase of a true talented negotiator. The pace of the film is slow, but not to the extent of making you sleepy. In comparison, it is like a broth or stew that has to be simmered slowly to bring out the flavours. Else, the development of the characters' mindsets and opinions would have been rather underwhelming.Do not let the age of the film fool you.

1670,clariceseng,An unexpectedly enjoyable film that I would highly recommend!,9,6 November 2017,"In Sidney Lumet's film 12 Angry Men, the fate of a teenage boy facing a murder trial lies in the hands of a jury comprising of twelve men from varying backgrounds and different degrees of motivation coming into the court hearing. Some are present merely out of national duty, whereas others, particularly Davis, the only juror who in the beginning voted the accused as not guilty, take their role seriously as a life is at stake. I was initially skeptical about how entertaining this film would be given that it is a black and white film revolving around twelve men in a room discussing a case with no change in setting at all. I was prepared to fall asleep, but boy was I wrong. This film turned out to be one of the most meaningful and engaging film that I have watched, and I thoroughly enjoyed watching the negotiation process between members of the jury. I am impressed at how the producer was able to raise certain issues about the jury system like prejudice and personal bias subtly in the film, and the film brought out raw emotions like frustration and anger which are realistic emotions that jurors might feel when in the back and forth process of negotiating. The film shows the importance of objective and rational decision- making especially in the context of determining the outcome of a sentencing, at the same time not neglecting the complexity of negotiation due to differing interests that parties involved hold.

This shows perhaps how much and how little we have progressed over half a century - although technology and skills have improved by leaps and bounds when one looks at cinematography, the ugly side of humanity with its biases and judgemental attitudes remain.

1672,joyannchua,12 angry men,8,6 November 2017,"I personally really enjoyed this movie and thought it had a humorous yet insightful take on negotiations. The movie highlighted a few mistakes that people often make when negotiating, without even being aware of it. One of such mistakes was clearly displayed by Juror 3. He ended up arguing his stand because of his pride, rather than his principle. On the other hand, we see Juror 8 detached from his stand of 'not guilty'. Rather than being stubborn about his own view, he focused on the evidence of the case, never lost his temper and was open to opinions of the other Jurors that opposed his. Comparing between these 2 Jurors, it is obvious which negotiation style led to a more favourable result. Juror 8 not only managed to invite the others to participate but also led a smooth negotiation with a conclusive outcome that all parties agreed on. As a viewer of the ongoing negotiations, I found myself shifting from agreeing with Juror 3 and his 'guilty' stand at the start, to getting frustrated with his subjective point of view at the end. Even with obvious reasonable doubt, he refused to change his view because he was wanted to 'save face'. I could imagine losing my temper and refusing to engage in any more discussions were I to be in such a negotiation, which would ultimately lead to no definite outcome.This movie made me reflect on the different negotiation styles and which usually reaps the most results. Ironically, while everyone could see that Juror 8 was a much better negotiator, the reality of it is that most people behave like Juror 3 and get their personal emotions involved when negotiating.

We can draw similarities to the issues that were explored in the film 12 Angry Men. In numerous occasions, the men's judgment were blurred by racial prejudice, so much that they could not make a clear, rational decision on whether to prosecute the black boy. Drawing insights from Fisher's book Getting to Yes and relating it to the film, we can see here what may have impeded effective negotiation, preventing an impartial and agreeable outcome.Throughout the movie, Davis as the protagonist of 12 Angry Men is thereby strongly represented as an effective negotiator that corresponds to what Fisher offered in his book.",12 Angry Men
1675,skindeepcinderella,12 Angry Men - Negotiations,8,7 November 2017,"The movie ""12 Angry Men"" is about 12 jurors who embark on a difficult task to reach a unanimous vote to either acquit or convict a young man for the murder of his father. The discussion takes place in a stiflingly hot and cramped room where all the members of the jury are motivated to end the session quickly, except for one (Juror 8). In the span of the movie, Juror 8 was able to convince all other 11 jurors to vote ""Not Guilty"", though with difficulty and obstacles. The film depicts negotiations at play, which will be discussed in correspondence to Fisher & Ury's ""Getting to Yes"" book. #1 Moving from Positional Bargaining to Focusing on Interests According to Fisher and Ury (1981), parties should refrain from positional bargaining and to instead, practice principled negotiations. During the jury discussion, positional bargaining is accurately displayed. The jurors started off indicating their stance through an internal vote. This reveals their differing positions and they argue about it till the group ultimately concurs with one position. Once jurors took on positional bargaining, it was a challenge to move from being fixated on their individual positions to focus instead on interests and perspectives of others so as to constructively create wise agreements. One underlying common interest that can be identified among-st the jurors is that all of them wants justice for the murder case. This is even though their perception of what ""justice"" could be is largely contrasting. One side felt that the case could be deliberated longer so as to give the disadvantaged boy a fair shot. Whereas, the other side felt that justice would be best served through conviction and an eventual death penalty. Many times, behind strongly-opposing positions, lie shared interests too. Perhaps, recognizing and reconciling similar interests could positively change the circumstances and position the jurors as combating the problem together as opposed to combating each other. Fortunately, with Juror 8's convincing argument and powerful influence, he was able to garner the support of the otherwise-opposing jurors. Otherwise, he would have either backed down by changing his stance or have the jury declared as a hung one. Either of these, would not have had any positive consequences. #2 Separating people from the problemFisher & Ury (1981) postulate that it is crucial to separate people from the issues. As seen from the discussion, the jurors got visibly agitated when others were not on their side. Perhaps they felt that their opinions were being encroached on and had interpreted objections from others as personal attacks. Inevitably, the relationship between them became entangled with the issue.The authors identified three people problems, namely perception, emotions, and communication. Firstly, the tension depicted is the result of variances among-st the jurors, in terms of personalities, values, backgrounds, and worldviews. These form up their perceptions that contribute to what they think, say or do during the discussions. Since conflicts in negotiations often stem from differing interpretations of facts, it is then imperative for all to understand the viewpoints of other parties. Also, the audience is given a glimpse of the deeply-entrenched prejudices one can have. Juror 10 seemed racist and has obvious biases against the defendant. Also, as Juror 3 has a hostile relationship with his son, he is seemingly unable to separate his ill-feelings towards his son and the defendant. Secondly, the agonizing heat led to them perspiring profusely, adding on to their irritability and irrational thought processes. As such, voices rose and tempers flared during their deliberations. Emotions visibly ran high, but however, were rarely acknowledged in the movie. Thirdly, communication broke down when some jurors walked out or were simply a bystander instead of an active participant in the discussions. For instance, the shy Juror 2 was sidelined by the much louder Juror 3 & 10. Active listening should be practiced so that everyone has a stake in negotiations and to prevent misunderstandings or sides-taking. Only when the jurors communicate effectively, will they be able to gain new perspectives and resolve the conflict amicably. #3 Using Objective Criteria To help resolve conflicts, negotiators should utilize objective criteria. Battling wills and pressurizing others to back down would hurt relationships and lead to unwise agreements. Hence, the use of legitimate, practical, relevant and objective criteria will create a fair procedure to resolve a dispute. Given the tense situation, there is immense importance to align the jury's objectives, goals, and rules in negotiations. The foreman was attempting to be as fair as he could. However, as he also voted ""Guilty"" initially, he may have been subconsciously biased. As the head juror, he is expected to be a neutral facilitator and mediator. Perhaps he could have spelled out an agenda, establish ground rules/procedures, and to summarize discussions. For example, they could engage in rule- setting in the beginning, to provide structure and forbid certain actions such as personal attacks, name-calling or shouting. The foreman chose not to engage in this as he started off the discussion saying he was ""not going to make any rules"". Hence, it was inevitable that the jurors were not on the same page; they presumed the guilt of the boy, seemed rather flippant about the situation and were not willing to engage in meaningful debates. For instance, a disinterested Juror 10 was doodling while others were discussing. Furthermore, Juror 7 indicated his impatience when he said ""this better be fast"" as he had tickets to a ball game that night. Setting rigid time constraints and deadlines would not be helpful to a productive and robust negotiation session. In addition, Juror 8 used scientific facts alongside with his deductions, such as the fastest possible speed the old male witness could walk and the eyesight of the female witness. This was a form of objective criteria as it was logical reasoning and facts rather than arbitrary feelings or thoughts.",12 Angry Men
1676,chewsijing,Review on '12 Angry Men',8,8 November 2017,"""I just want to talk."" Juror 8 asserted to his team of compatriots in the jury room, being the only member of the jury that pleaded 'not guilty' out of the twelve. Standing at a vote of 1-11, Davis, starring Henry Fonda, held the reasonable doubt that the evidence presented in court was not substantial to convict the 18-year old of a death sentence. At that moment, his unconventional vote incurred the wrath of many. What could have seemingly been established within a few minutes will now turn into a long deliberation, before reaching the end of the verdict. With no factual proof but mainly assumptions, he was dealt the unlikely odds of winning his case. Yet, to uphold the truth and justice, he held the right attitude: To be firm and fair in negotiation. 12 Angry Men was a powerful and instructive film that laid out a typical negotiation scene in the jury room. Members of the jury, belonging to different age groups, status and social backgrounds, were selected at random from various communities in the district. These twelve men then deliberated over the case of a first-degree murder, by beginning with the element of negotiation from the outset: The discussion to talk things out. A series of event were then unfolded and documented, as each juror took turns to proclaim his opinions and convince another that held dissenting views, before reaching a unanimous decision. All Juror 8 requested was for the jury to present their case and analysis of their judgment of 'guilty', to identify any logical justifications. Here, he understood his role as a negotiator to differentiate between 'position' and 'interest' as once a position has been established, it becomes tedious to alter. Thus, he was careful of not allowing positions to drive out interests. On the other hand, Juror 3 by Lee. J Cobb, was stubbornly adamant about his position as the jury member that appeals for 'guilty'. He started with a strong ability to reason about the existential facts, which however, as time goes by began to reveal cracks beneath the surface of his arguments. Holding a bias against delinquents, he was extreme on his views and showed no signs of concession to any proved investigations, often offending other members. Hence the process of negotiation requires less attention on positions or risk no agreement being formed.The movie intentionally highlighted how the vast differences in the twelve, got in their way of achieving a consensus and how circumstances (e.g. weather) impacted them. Often, their arguments side-tracked and led to a series of confrontational retorts and personal attacks, instead of a reasonable discussion that tackles the core of the problem. One of the scenes that revealed a member changing sides from 'guilty' to 'not guilty' in a crucial anonymous vote, was a good illustration of being people- focused than problem-focused. Juror 3 let his emotions outburst when he confronted Juror 5 (Jack Klugman), accusing him of changing his vote because he empathized with the defendant, coming from slums himself. The false accusation then led to a lousy impression of Juror 3. This showcased personal prejudice against the person, rather than understanding the reasons behind the stand and hence the problem, spiraling into subsequent biases against issues. In conclusion, this is certainly a movie that is worth the watch, capturing all scenes and emotions of the 12 jurors within a jury room.",12 Angry Men
1677,jesslsh,Brilliant,10,8 November 2017,"The film 12 Angry Men is an artful demonstration of a maneuvering of a challenging negotiation. It is a challenging negotiation as it is one fraught with personal biases and emotions of the negotiators. Notwithstanding, these are dynamics that could potentially inflict any negotiation, as these characteristics are almost inevitable in negotiators being humans. The situation where the single minority turns the majority over seems to be the result of a coincidental alignment of factors, such as seemingly skilled negotiators, cooperative partners, and so on. However, there are indeed strategic actions that facilitated a movement towards a principled negotiation. A constant theme is the idea of creating space in a negotiation and giving respect for people. Fundamentally, negotiators are humans, and each are fallible to their own biases and vulnerabilities. It is important to open the space for negotiation and proceed with respect for the other. This could be achieved through strategic actions such as framing the negotiation process as well as habits of active listening and observing. With these, it will enable us to be able to deal with difficult scenarios in a negotiation too. It is a must-watch for anyone who is interested in negotiation or who simply enjoys some brilliant banter.",12 Angry Men
1678,teowqeleanor,What is the role of a jury?,10,8 November 2017,"A 1957 American courtroom drama film, adapted from Reginald Rose's teleplay, is an absorbing and compelling movie that attempts to answer the all-important question above with serious implications where a boy's life is decided in the stance taken by each juror. The 96 minutes film delves into approaches of consensus-building, and the challenges involved in the negotiation process among the jurors, each with their own perspectives, experiences and personalities that come into play during moments of intense conflicts. The film starts with the judge's apathetic delivery of instructions, as he informs the jurors to ""separate the facts from the fancy"". Indeed, it is important for jurors to objectively separate the people from the problem to get a clearer view of the substantive problem. However, in the film, Juror 10 expresses his displeasure and condemnation towards 'slum-born people' such as the accused. He further alleges that ""slums breed criminals"" and they are ""no better than animals who kill for fun"". This scene is perhaps one of the most powerful in demonstrating the blatant impacts of racism and prejudicial mindsets. As the film progresses, Juror #8, played by Fonda, tries to establish objective standards, free from biases that may stem from individual personalities, emotions and experiences. However, this is easier said than done in reality as demonstrated in the film where each juror is characterized in terms of their backgrounds, occupations and prejudices. Fonda also makes it a critical point to help the group focus on interests. The jurors communicate the need to understand their roles clearly and the importance of taking ownership of their stance to ensure a democratic process, and not switch sides without reasons, recognizing the objective criteria. Juror 11's anger towards Juror 7, who changes his vote in hope to end expediently to attend his baseball match reminds us the importance of having a jury which is to ensure a fair hearing and provide the accused with a voice. A classic courtroom drama with a unique twist, 12 Angry Men portrays the American justice system and provides a lens to reflect on the intimate ways one relates to another in our daily lives. The film brings to light how discriminatory mindsets may be subconsciously formed where prejudice obscures the truth and blurs objectivity. The film is excellent in educating people on the impacts of every big and small decision made where the main issue may not be everything as it seems. Indeed, the jury fulfils a crucial role in the legal system, and in our everyday lives, in the communities we live and work in, the need for structured work processes may inevitably increase barriers towards help-seeking where helping professionals in the community may become boxed up in ticking criteria forms.",12 Angry Men
1679,annabananatyl,12 Angry Men - Old but Gold,10,9 November 2017,"12 Angry Men is a captivating film set entirely in a sweltering jury room of a courthouse. The jury must deliberate whether an 18-year-old boy from the slums is guilty of murdering his father. A guilty verdict means that the boy will die. As the jury starts their discussion, the line is immediately drawn with 11 members voting 'guilty' and Juror 8 voting 'not guilty'. As the men tries to reach a unanimous decision, conflict arises, and we are led to see how the different jurors view the case. Some let their personal issues cloud their decisions, while others are barely invested in the situation and simply want to leave the room. Juror 8 eventually manages to convince all 11 men to reconsider their stand on the case. One insight gleaned from the film is how our past experiences can lead to the development of deep-seated bias. As Juror 8 leads the others through the case, not only does he uncover clues that shows there is more to the case, he also reveals the prejudices and preconceptions that the jury have about the trial, the accused, and each other. The boy accused of the murder came from the slums. For many members of the jury, that is enough to confirm that he is guilty. The people from the slums were insensitively referred to as 'born liars', wild, violent and that 'there is not one that is any good'. Thus, it is no wonder that the boy would commit a murder and it is obvious that he is guilty. The jurors who agreed with these over-generalizations are not deliberating on the case based on the facts alone, but letting their own bias cloud their visions. It proved difficult for them to even realize that they do have these biases. Juror 3 was also shown to have personal problems with his son and wrongly transferred the anger onto the case as well as fellow members of the jury. At the end, it was a sobering scene as the jury came to the realization that they do hold prejudices, misgivings and mindsets that were wrongly imposed on the case. From 12 Angry Men, we can see how preconceived notions impacted the way the jurors communicated. Though set in 1957, the film provides an excellent case study on negotiation, offering many insights that are relevant as we communicate with others today.",12 Angry Men

It speaks a motivational tale on the overcoming of adversity through the powers of negotiation. Indeed, the main protagonist's unwavering spirit against insurmountable odds should serve as a shining testament to the powers of negotiation. Against all odds, he's managed to convince the majority of his peers simply by appealing to their rational side.In addition, the movie takes place almost in real time and the gradual shift in the camera's focal length throughout the film complements the intensity of the situation.The only complaint I have are the convenient arguments sometimes being pulled without prior foreshadowing may seem a little Deus ex machina to me.

The boy would get the death sentence if the outcome is that he is guilty and the votes by the jurors had to be unanimous before the verdict can be made. The movie started with eleven 'guilty' votes against one 'not guilty' vote by juror 8. In this film, we see how twelve jurors with varying personalities and temperaments, state their ground and convince the rest on the stand that they believe in. This movie brings out the power of negotiation and understanding to achieve a common consensus. It was a refreshing movie for me as I had never watched such a movie before. The script was very well planned as it really incorporated elements of negotiation worth learning and the execution of negotiation was also nicely done by the cast. I would recommend watching this movie as it is indeed very different from the movies now.

Despite the fact that the film is essentially set in one room, it remains fascinating to observe who the innate stubbornness of the men is challenged as their thoughts and views are continuously questioned; thus, they end up questioning themselves.

His fate is left to a jury of twelve men of different backgrounds and motivations. Some find this national duty burdensome, some are proud of America for being a democracy, others like Davis take their role seriously as a life is at stake. The film shows how Davis painstakingly convinces the rest of the jury that there is reasonable doubt of the accused's guilt, despite facing strong resistance from the start. Thanks to Davis, the outcome ultimately favours the accused.

1696,elliottan,Amazing movie!,9,25 March 2018,"12 Angry Men is a film that illustrates the diversity present in the society that we live in, and how the discordant ideas of people can fuel but also complicate negotiations. Although somewhat unrealistic due to extremely polar depictions of human behaviour, the movie manages to capture the characteristics of people from different walks of life, manifested in each of the twelve jurors.Some analysis with minor spoilers!!
Juror #8, the ""hero"" of the movie, displays objectivity and empathy, and gradually earns respect as a leader. From the outset, although ridiculed and singled out by the other eleven, he was unmoving with his open-minded stance that the boy deserved a fair chance to be acquitted. As Fisher and Ury put it in the book ""Getting To Yes"", ""Never yield to pressure, only to principle"". He believed in using ""fair standards"", thus he attempted to rally the others to be empathetic. If they were in the boy's situation, wouldn't they want their jury to be impartial and take their jobs seriously, especially since a life is at stake? Using the ""principle of reciprocity"", he brought awareness to the consequences of the decision, subtly appealing to those more rational. Being grounded and respected helps a lot when negotiating, because humans naturally tend to trust and follow someone they respect. In negotiations, the only certainty is that we will encounter a vast array of backgrounds, personalities, and ideologies. Despite being the cardinal concern over the course of the film, the reality of guilt or innocence turns out unimportant. Exemplifying how a diverse group of people can reach a unanimous, amicable decision, 12 Angry Men serves as a reminder that a wide range of perspectives, as well as positive negotiation skills, are crucial in any negotiation.",12 Angry Men

The defendant is an 18 year old boy from the slums and all 12 of the jurors have to unanimously agree, on the basis of reasonable doubt, whether or not the boy should be found guilty and henceforth receive a mandatory death sentence.Through depicting skilful negotiation by the protagonist, the film effectively addresses important societal issues such as prejudice, stereotypes and discrimination. Interestingly, though it was produced over half a century ago, it still remains extremely relevant today. This is unfortunate, as it shows how little society has progressed. However, the plot's progress gives us a silver lining and shows us that ultimately, objectivity transcends prejudice and emotions.",12 Angry Men
1698,bogdanascheylov,GW,7,29 March 2018,"I do not understand how you can film so well in 1957. This is one of the few films of the time that I liked. Therefore, the assessment corresponds to 8/10",12 Angry Men
1699,marcus_awesim,Negotiation techniques in an amazing film,9,14 April 2018,"""However you decide, your verdict must be unanimous... you are faced with a great responsibility"". With those words, a jury is sent to deliberate the fate of a defendant. 12 Angry Men portrays the jury's process of coming to that crucial consensus. While eleven jurors deem the defendant guilty, Juror 8 (8) attempts to change their minds through a series of negotiations and reasoning. He utilises logic and sticks to his principles and belief in the face of majority opposition. Coupled with the jury members' receptiveness, it allows them to reach a unanimous decision that also reminds us about the need for empathy in decision-making. 8 controls his emotions and does not let it cloud his judgement, rather depending on objectivity to make his case as well as interact with the other jurors. In this aspect, we see the contrast between jurors. 8 is calm, listening respectfully and reflecting back what he hears. Meanwhile, Juror 10 (10) and 3 give in to their emotions, going on angry tirades and allowing prejudices to cloud their judgement. For example, 3 wrongly accuses Juror 5 (5) of changing his vote on the assumption that he is biased because of his upbringing in the slum. He also mocks Juror 9 (9), asking him to sell his sayings to newspapers. Similarly, 10 allows his prejudice to affect his emotions, ranting that ""We're facing a danger here... they are wild animals... they want to destroy us"", implying that he votes guilty because he views ""these people"" as dangerous animals, not because of the evidence. This failure to correct for skewed vision causes 10 and 3 to interpret information in a self-serving way. Their prejudice colours their interpretation of information and how they treat others, creating tension toward them that ultimately works against them. The antagonism they create in the room undermines their credibility as the film progresses. By sticking to his principles, 8 manages to keep his objectiveness and impartiality, remaining consistent even in the face of immense pressure. As the only juror who votes 'not guilty', 8 acts as the sole dissentor, the minority that social scientists identify as one who influences behaviours through consistency. By consistently believing that it is the jury's duty to preserve the law, 8 stands his ground and does not accept a bottom line where the issue would be pushed to a new jury for a retrial. Instead, he remains firm and sets out objective criteria, using logic to influence and swing the jury to his side. Hence, we see that our principles must be consistent in order to logically influence others as the minority.The outcomes of negotiations often affect the lives of people. As 8 says, ""We're talking about somebody's life here"". Empathy goes a long way in making such decisions. If the jury voted guilty, 10 and 3 might have 'won' in their respective positions, but a life would have been lost. Hence, although we are tasked to separate people from the problem, we must also consider the people in the solutions. By being empathetic, we can understand why certain people take up particular positions, and also prevent ourselves from making similar mistakes. Thus, although negotiation is often mistaken as a win-loss scenario, it is not the case. Through positive and collaborative negotiation, we can reach a consensus that benefits everyone.",12 Angry Men

Through the heated exchanges among the jurors and the intriguing build up of the case as the story unfolds, we discover more about the distinctive personalities and backgrounds of each juror, who is peculiarly only referred to by number and not by name. Furthermore, we gain insights into the techniques they employ and difficulties they face in multi-party negotiation while trying to justify their stand and convince the others to switch over to their position. The movie incorporates light-hearted moments and comical dialogues to make it enjoyable for the viewers, and the technique of incrementally adding on to the narrative as the discussion progresses keeps the audience engaged. However, beneath the entertainment value of the film lie lessons in negotiation that we can learn from.

The film showed Juror 8 as the only juror in a murder trial who did not vote for a guilty charge for the accused at the first vote.

However, #8 exemplified the abilities of a skilled negotiator, convincing the entire jury to change their minds to a ""not guilty"" verdict, which would save a man's life.

Even though the film was set in one location, there was never a dull point and the conversations and debates between the jurors were always so intense and exciting. The film uses the decision-making process of 12 jurors to bring us on a roller-coaster of emotions. In the short one hour and 36 minutes, many uncomfortable issues were brought to light. This included discrimination, racism, and even more personal problems like self-purpose and worth. All these issues were presented to the audience in a very bite-sized way, with each juror embodying one, allowing us to see the parallels in our own lives. What I found most interesting was how the importance of being a good negotiator shined through for me in the film. 12 Angry Men was able to portray the wide spectrum of negotiators, from skilled and objective negotiators, to hot-headed and ego-centric ones. Through them, we were able to see the repercussions of allowing our emotions and personal pre-conceived notions overwhelm our decisions. I learnt to not be so quick to judge and to always consider the possibility of alternatives before being certain about something. There will always be things that we will not see or know. But yes, all in all, I truly enjoyed the movie as it left me thinking about the uncomfortable issues that we may not always want to deal with.

1706,itsmeclaudia,"A real classic film, but falls short of meeting realistic expectations",8,23 April 2018,"The film '12 Angry Men' is set in a courtroom where a jury of twelve men deliberate the charge of a defendant of a murder trial with the aim of reaching a unanimous vote. Operating on the principle of reasonable doubt, the film appeals to viewers as it depicts the contrasting ways of examining a situation that is both intriguing and captivating, even better that it was in black and white. Although the film as a whole had many captivating moments, it was a line expressed by juror 9 that changed the game for me. He voted for 'not guilty' and explicitly explained his vote, ""I respect his motives, but the boy in trial is probably guilty; but I want to hear more."" This line impressed upon me two things: that a person who was previously on the far opposite end of a view could be so open-minded as to consider the possibility of a contrasting view even with little concrete evidence, and that the negotiator (juror 8) could succeed at persuasion just by communicating his motives, which is more significant in the face of such a weak case. This showed me how effective and powerful persuasion can be, especially since beliefs shape our actions which in turn affects everything and everyone.In spite of this, there are also certain aspects of the film that are merely fictional and problems that are harder to deal with in reality. This is seen in one part of the film where the protagonist gave up his interests at one point in time and arrange for a secret ballot where he would change his vote to 'guilty' if there was a unanimous vote. Although juror 9 did vote 'not guilty' and the group of men began negotiating again, realistically it would not happen as parties would move on and forget about your interests once you give them up.

I enjoyed how the complexity of human prejudice is explored in the film.

Juror 10 is a racist bigot, who makes no effort to hide his contempt for residents of the slums. Juror 10 frequently has emotional outbursts, and offended Juror 5, who grew up in a slum, and disrespected the elderly Juror 9 with his crude remarks. Juror 3 is a forceful man who is intolerant of others, with a strong but hidden prejudice against juveniles, which reminds him of his estranged son. Driven by their prejudice, Jurors 3 and 10 were unable to distinguish their emotions from their perception of the problem, causing their decisions to lose objectivity. The film reveals to me how prejudice can significantly distort and influence people's ability to rational decisions.
The truth of whether the boy actually committed the murder was never revealed, even at the end of the film. The truth matters little when compared to the significance of how what we perceive may not actually be what is, which the film was able to put across splendidly. My main takeaway is that when entering a new discussion, it is important to be receptive and empathetic but yet firm toward positional pressure in order to produce a convincing argument. This is a film that is worth watching.",12 Angry Men
1709,leeyuxiang,Negotiation at its best,10,24 April 2018,"12 Angry Men is indeed a classical film depicting how sensible negotiations can lead to a optimal outcome and drastically change the views of a human of ripe years.12 men decided the fate of a young murder suspect accused of killing his father. Everyone showed the ugly side of their temperament, flaring up at different trigger points. However, good negotiation techniques, and not compromise, allowed Juror 8 and his supporters to navigate the tough debate and come to a fair decision. This movie shows how we can apply negotiation skills to our daily social situations to help all of us reach outcomes that are mutually beneficial to the parties involved.",12 Angry Men
1710,wanjee,Disagreement to Successful Negotiation,8,24 April 2018,"In this movie 12 Angry Men, 12 jurors convene in a jury room to decide the verdict of an 18-year-old boy from the slums who had been convicted of murdering his father. Since the premise of the movie revolves around the negotiation of whether the boy is guilty or not guilty, three key insights are highlighted with regards to successful, principled negotiation: firstly, reconciling interests rather than positions; secondly, the strategy of negotiation jujitsu to counter positional bargaining; and lastly, the importance of separating people from positions and remembering that negotiation is between human beings. This is an insightful movie which allows us as humans to think and ponder about our words and actions in a disagreement, using them to intentionally turn it into a successful negotiation instead.",12 Angry Men

1712,mihaicatescu-13598,Maximum out of minimum,10,9 November 2018,A movie that shows the reasons behind people s judgement. Some tend to be objective while others are driven by a bad personal experience when they give their opinion on a certain situation.Altough the whole action take place in a few chambers it is so captivating watching the conversation between the judges that you can not take your eyes off. during the film through the discussion there are revealed mentalities of people from different backgrounds.I believe that is a movie worth watching for its revealing of the true nature of human perception over good bad and justice.,12 Angry Men
1713,jasperschotte,Twisted and turned,10,19 September 2018,"The film itself is as steady as a rock: the performances given by each of the jurors are absolutely outstanding. And the camerawork is amazing. But the thing that's really astonishing, is how well the script is written. 
At the beginning of the movie it seems a clear cut case: The boy's guilty, no doubt.
But as it progresses, and each time juror number eight, or nine, notices something new, something that make's you thing about the boys guilt, or innocence, the case get's, like Lee Cobb said: Twisted and turned. Not in a way that the boy is clearly guilty and should get the death penalty. But in a way that it's very unlikely the boy hasn't done it, but as heroic as juror number eight is in his way, he stands up to the fate of the boy, because there's room for reasonable doubt. And can get everyone to agree with the fact that it is not for a hundred percent sure the boy has done it.
Although juror number eight knows that the chance the boys guilty, is maybe even greater than the chance he's not, he still believes in that room for reasonable doubt. And in second chances.",12 Angry Men

1716,ArranJParkes,You'll never forget the first time you see it.,10,29 May 2018,"12 Angry Men is such a simple concept, masterfully executed by Director Sidney Lumet.12 Jurors must vote unanimously to decide whether or not a young man is guilty of murdering his father. The film is set into motion when all but 1 of the 12 jurors vote guilty.Juror No.8 (Henry Fonda) makes the case that the young man on trial could be guilty however he wants to consider the case a little more before deciding to vote and ultimately deciding the fate of the accused. As tensions start to run high Juror No. 8 faces an uphill battle to convince the other 11 jurors there may perhaps be more than meets the eye.When I was watching it for the first time I felt like I was Juror No.13, constantly on the edge of my seat awaiting the next big revelation.On a promotional piece for the film it says ""IT EXPLODES LIKE 12 STICKS OF DYNAMITE!"". I couldn't agree more. 12 Angry Men is a riveting, powerful and uplifting experience that's message is still relevant today.Without a doubt it will always be one of my favorite movies of all time.

But this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Henry Fonda's performance in this movie is one of the greatest acting performances I've ever seen. Twelve men locking in a room discussing a case literally gave me chills and goosebumps throughout most of the movie. My heart stopped and my jaw dropped when Fonda took the knife out of his pocket and stabbed it into the table. This movie is not for everyone. I used to know a guy who said multiple times in the period that I knew him, ""If nothin' blows up, it ain't a movie."" Not everyone is as big of fan of movies as I am, but if you consider yourself a fan of all types of genres and superior acting, then find a way to watch this movie. There is a good reason this movie, (at the time of which I am writing this review,) is in the top five highest rated movies of all time on IMDb.",12 Angry Men
1723,hoangdacviet,The film changed my perspective,10,27 August 2018,"Honestly, this is one of those 'must see' movies that will never feel like a chore to watch. Sometimes we feel like we have to see a movie just because it's one of the greats; this one you'll want to watch because it IS great.The acting here is superb. Hardly surprising considering the cast, but it could have easily gone wrong. The characters here perfectly stride the line of archetypes without falling into the trap of caricature. In just 96 minutes, you get 12 characters who all feel real, and who all have their own desires, biases, and motivations. Most movies are impressive if they can flesh out one or two characters to the degree that all 12 jurors get in this movie.And speaking of the lean 96 minute running time mentioned in the last paragraph, 12 Angry Men keeps moving at a pace you wouldn't expect for a movie about 12 people who pretty much just talk in a single room for the entire movie (well, two rooms if you count a few minutes spent in the bathroom). Even those with a short attention span should be able to enjoy this one.I don't think I'm blowing anybody's mind by giving a great review to a movie that's been getting great reviews for half a century, but I just want to make sure that YOU see this movie. Don't put it in your Netflix queue and forget about it. Don't talk about renting it one day. Get it now, watch it tonight, and never regret it.",12 Angry Men

Each character represents the different characters in society and its deeply-rooted flaws. Hence, it paints a bigger picture of constitutional inequality and susceptibility to manipulation within the American judicial system that all countries can relate to, including Singapore. Hence, this movie serves as a poignant warning that everyone has a social responsibility to respect the judicial system as a platform to protect individual rights, regardless of background.",12 Angry Men

While it might be slow at the beginning, it captures the audience's attention with its nuances and necessitates focus in order to follow the storyline.This film captures perfectly what a jury might look like in America, and allows the viewer to deliberate on the process together with the jury, helping to develop civic-mindedness whilst understanding the implications of the legal system as a layman. For example, the film requires viewers to understand the term ""beyond reasonable doubt"" as one of the core tenets of the negotiation.Overall, I would highly recommend this movie.",12 Angry Men
1729,gekching,A surprisingly entertaining and interesting movie,9,24 October 2018,"When I was assigned to watch 12 Angry men for one of my classes, I was dreading it a bit as I thought that the movie would be very long and boring. This is especially so after I heard that the movie was in black and white. However, the movie surprised me greatly by being surprisingly entertaining and interesting. It would not be a stretch to say that the movie captivated me for almost a 100 minutes.The flow of the movie was also very logical and easy to follow. The movie opens with a introduction of each of the juror's character traits which helped to contextualise the rest of the movie. It is interesting how the character traits of the jurors were illuminated as the movie went on.I was really impressed with how Juror 8 used negotiation techniques such as separating people from the problem and focusing on the interest of the various parties to eventually obtain a fairer judgement for the defendant. By maintaining an objective criteria, Juror 8 managed to tease out the subtle inaccuracies in the testimonies of the witnesses. I enjoyed seeing how the movie unfolded and to see how the inaccuracies in the testimonies were debated on.Personally, my favourite part of the movie was when Juror 2 who was portrayed as meek in the beginning of the movie, stepped up to assert that there might be some discrepancies with how the switchblade was used. This not only helped as a plot device to propel the story forward, it also showed how the negotiation process managed to help a person grow little.",12 Angry Men
1730,samanthahosueyen,A very insightful movie with learning points in negotiation,8,2 November 2018,"Watching the movie, in conjunction with reading the book ""Getting to Yes"" by Roger Fisher, I was pleasantly surprised at how the theories from the book came to ""live"" in the movie. The movie truly showed very strong elements of principled negotiation of the protagonist contrasted against the positional bargaining of the other jurors. The reasons behind the different negotiating style was also well explained and in line with what the book posited, such as positional bargaining, which is a result of not being able to separate people from the problem and neglecting one's interests to focus on the positions instead. Furthermore, interesting negotiation techniques were used by the protagonist to be able to share his opinions effectively and deal with stubborn jurors, which could be an inspiration to how we handle negotiations and conflicts in our lives",12 Angry Men
1731,caleblook,A brilliant film about negotiation and the workings of law,10,5 November 2018,"""12 Angry Men"" is a 1957 American courtroom drama film adapted from a teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose. The film describes the story of a 12-men jury in a New York City courthouse deliberating the case of an 18-year-old Hispanic slum-born boy who had allegedly stabbed his father to death. The objective criterion used was reasonable doubt - that is, if the jury had any reasonable doubt as to the culpability of the boy, they were to return a verdict of not guilty. Conversely, if the jury had no reasonable doubt as to how culpable the boy was, they were to return a verdict of guilty, and the boy would be sentenced to death accordingly.""12 Angry Men"" compellingly explores many powerful techniques of negotiation - that is, how to build consensus amongst a group of people with starkly different personalities and worldviews. ""12 Angry Men"" is an outstanding masterpiece of a film that has withstood the test of time. The film relies less on elaborate special effects and costumes but impresses all the same simply because of the excellent plot and consummate acting.""12 Angry Men"" is a film highly recommended to people young and old. Because it is a courtroom drama, ""12 Angry Men"" may be especially interesting to law students, lawyers and those interested in the workings of law.",12 Angry Men

I have watched it over 50 times overe the years, and always find somethig new - in the words, the camera, the characters, the mood...
(I have read the one, two, and three star reviews - who complain it is in black & white, or set in just one room, or only had men!! They do not see the irony, that THEY are the jurors with irrational presuppositions that we are all wary of. THEY are the jurors in that room that decide the fate of a person. Read their reviews - and be very afraid. (Note: you can hate the film, but your reasons must be rational)).
This is as perfect a movie, with deeper themes, as you can get.
It is about democracy and prejudice and peer pressure and scepticism and free thinking and civic responsibility and privelege and hope.
There are so many subtle cinematographic techniques that enhance the themes.
This is a movie to be engaged with.

It was one of my best choices, because I've never seen a movie which basically revolves arround a single scenario holding someone so much time. The concept is very simple and the dialogues are as simple as such, but the movie's magic is at the storie's unfolding, showing how a single person can influences other people only using arguments.
Finally, for me, it's a fantastic movie and it's obligated for some professionals (e.g. lawyers).",12 Angry Men

1742,skorpionman,One of the Best,8,10 February 2019,"I was very positively blown away by this movie. I definitely must say that it is one of the best I hae seen. Something that I find very fascinating about it is that it keeps you interested in the story and on the edge of your seat even though it takes place in the same room for the entirety of it and it is just made up of conversation. in that respect it reminds me of ""Rope"" by Alfred Hitchcock, which I think is a masterpiece.
The performances are very engaging and I think that all of the characters were portrayd in a very well done and believeable way. Henry Fonda is obviously very good but I was happy that he didn´t steal the show despite being the main character. All of the characters had their time to shine and their own little character arc.
Before watching this I wouldnt have thought that a bunch of people arguing could be this entertaining to watch however later on I was legitemately sad to see it end. I belive I could honestly watch this movie for days. It just never gets dull.
The mystery aspect of the movie I think was very well handled for the most part. The fact that we do not know any of the evidence before the debate of the twelve jurors was very good because that way there were a lot of awesome scenes where a crucial piece of evidence was presented that turned the argument around. (A good example for this is the scene where Henry Fonda pulls out the knife.)
In the end the audience never finds out whether the young man actually comittted the murder or not which seems somwhat dissappointing to me but when thinking about it further I guess that´s the point of the movie. Its not really about whether the boy is guilty or not. It´s just about what you choose to believe.Overall this movie made for a very entertaining watch and I would recommend this movie to everybody. See it as soon as possible. I really loved it a lot and if it was possibl to give half stars I would give it an 8.5 instead of an 8 to get a more accurate rating. Maybe on a second viewing I´ll give it a 9 but that remains to be seen.Excellent film.",12 Angry Men
