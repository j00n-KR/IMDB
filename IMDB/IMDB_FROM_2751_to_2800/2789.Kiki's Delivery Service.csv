0,MartinHafer,Simply magical,10,11 June 2007,"This is an amazing movie that seems to get better with repeated viewings. Both my kids loved it so much, that we watched it many times, but oddly I didn't become tired of this cheery and unusual full-length cartoon.When the film began, one of the first things I noticed was the strange parallel world style of the artwork. It was if it was some OTHER planet Earth, where many of our towns are somehow merged into a mythical land that looks like Earth yet isn't. While there were many Japanese references, the towns looked rather European as well--like Denmark perhaps. Plus, in this parallel world, inventions of the early 20th century like zeppelins live on and people are NOT that amazed or scared at the prospect of a witch moving into town! As for the quality of this film, the animation, voices and story are terrific and exciting. While I have heard many refer to director Miyazaki as ""the Japanese Disney"", this isn't very accurate, as the style of his films is so very different from American animation--not better, not worse--just different.So overall, this is about as good as you'll get for an anime movie and it should appeal to all ages provided they are open-minded enough to give a foreign film a try.",Kiki's Delivery Service
1,TheLittleSongbird,A delightful little gem,9,23 November 2010,"Like I said with Nausicaa, Kiki's Delivery Service for me isn't quite a top 5 of my favourite Ghibli movies, it makes for a solid position in my top 10. It is a beautiful film, light-hearted and entertaining with very little to criticise really. The story is simple yet very imaginative, the dialogue is good and the pacing is well judged. My favourite assets of Kiki's Delivery Service are the animation, music and characters. The animation as you would expect is gorgeous especially in the colours, and the music is stunning. The characters are unique, likable and always engaging, I have to say Kiki is one of my favourite protagonists ever in a Ghibli movie and I mean that. Overall, lovely and delightful. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox",Kiki's Delivery Service
2,Leofwine_draca,A well-regarded Ghibli classic,7,27 April 2018,"KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE is another well-regarded classic from Japan's Studio Ghibli, the purveyors of the finest animation on Earth. This one tells the simple but oddly moving story of a 13 year old witch striving with responsibility and the need to grow up in a world largely devoid of magic. It reminds one of classic fantasy literature like that written by J.K. Rowling and Terry Pratchett, but is more refined and carefully-constructed than either of those authors. Truth be told, this is a simple story and one that's well told. Kiki herself has a depth of characterisation very rarely seen in this genre which makes this a worthy watch for kids and adults alike. I love the way the plot is grounded in reality and the magical elements are sparingly used. Kiki's relationship with her pet cat Jiji is very well portrayed and things build to a suitably grand and exciting disaster-fused climax. It's a film really worth watching in high definition, where the quality of the animation and in particular the colours are stunning.",Kiki's Delivery Service
3,SnoopyStyle,very cute but light as a feather,6,3 November 2016,Tradition is that a witch leaves home at thirteen for a year. Kiki is eager to leave with her talking black cat Jiji. She wants to see the ocean and arrives at a large seaside town. Tombo is a boy infatuated with Kiki and flying machines. Kiki is befriended by Osono who gives Kiki a job in her bakery and a place to stay. Kiki uses her only skill flying to create Kiki's Delivery Service.Kiki is exceedingly cute. The problem is that there is no continuous drama. Her journey is a series of meandering friendships. There is no villain and no quest or purpose. It's sorta like a single gal sitcom in the city. It has a puppy love element but it's a thin thread to hang a romance. There isn't any tension until she loses her flying ability. A coming of age movie would be better served with something more dramatic. This has a similar theme to Spirited Away but it doesn't have that exuberance or danger. It floats in the air like a feather but its drive is little more than blowing in the wind.,Kiki's Delivery Service
4,jboothmillard,Kiki's Delivery Service,5,10 January 2011,"From director Hayao Miyazaki (Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away), this is one of the Studio Ghibli films I remember hearing the title of a few times or spotted on DVD in shops, so being a fan of Japanese cartoon movies I watched. Basically young witch in training Kiki (Kirsten Dunst) has just turned thirteen, and according to tradition she is leaving home for one year to learn how to live on her own. So flying her broomstick with talking cat Jiji (Phil Hartman) by her side, she lands in the beautiful quaint European seaside town of Koricho to complete her witch studies and live. It is a chance meeting with Miss Dora, or Madame (Debbie Reynolds) that her powers become a big problem solver for the woman's business, so she hires the young witch to become a delivery girl. The business, with Kiki becoming renowned for her delivery services, is flourishing more, and Kiki finds herself pursued by local boy, aviation nerd and smitten Tombo (Matthew Lawrence). He slowly starts to warm to his affections and enjoys seeing his experiment attempts, but there is a point when he snaps at him, and not long his ability to fly her broomstick and talk to Jiji are disappearing. After a visit to young painter Ursula (Janeane Garofalo), Kiki returns to city, and witnesses Tombo in an accident which he needs rescuing from, and activating a new broomstick she flies to save him, and doing this her powers are restored. In the end Kiki decides that the delivery service is such a success, she is such a celebrity and she is so fond of Tombo that she informs her parents by letter she is staying where she is. Also starring Kath Soucie as Kiki's Mother, Jeff Bennett as Kiki's Father and The Simpsons' Tress MacNeille as Osono. The English dubbing voice casting from Disney, with a cute Dunst, an amusingly sarcastic Hartman and a brief bu worthwhile Garofalo, actually works. The animation is of course great quality, I guess I can agree this isn't black as the other Miyazaki films, but as a coming-of-age story with fun to watch flying sequences and great characters, this is an animated fantasy adventure to see. Worth watching!",Kiki's Delivery Service
5,ccthemovieman-1,Beautiful Artwork Highlights This Young Girl's Story,7,2 August 2008,"This is a nice story for small girls but even an old man like me could appreciate the fabulous colors in here. Man, this is one of the prettiest animated films I've seen. Hundreds of shots in here reminded me of beautiful paintings, from the pastel-colored roofs on the city houses to the great rural scenes.The story is a simple one: a 13-year-old witch takes off on her broom for a year of training. We follow her as she learns the ropes and goes to several towns where people befriend her, and she learns the importance of friendships herself, particular with a young boy who has a crush on her. Like I said, it's young girl stuff, but there are no villains, no scary parts, no language problems.....just a nice story, and there's nothing wrong with that! The only major change I would have made would be to make Kiki a more likable kid. She's downright cold and nasty, for no reason, to the boy, until the end. I didn't find her to be a character you could really care about, and that shouldn't have been.Which version to use: Japanese with English subtitles, or the dubbed American Disney version? I went back-and-forth with this and wound up with the dubbed. The major difference was Phil Hartman was much more effective as the cat and made that character much funnier. Both little girls' voices were almost like chalk on a blackboard for me, tough to take. Also, I've never liked Jeneane Garofolo or her voice. Nonetheless, I think most North Americans will pick the dubbed version, and that's okay.",Kiki's Delivery Service
6,Tweekums,An Enchanting Witch's Tale,10,4 April 2008,"It is hard to find any faults with this film, which isn't surprising given that it was made by Hayao Miyazaki. The film is beautiful from start to finish and suitable for all ages; there is no violence or offensive language, there isn't even a villain. The only character that isn't nice is an ungrateful child.While it might sound excessively sweet it never feels that way. Likewise the plot might sound a bit boring it is in fact utterly enchanting.The film starts with Kiki leaving home with her cat Jiji for a year's witch training that must be done somewhere that there are no other witches. The problem for Kiki is that she can't cast spells or make potions, her only skill is being able to fly so when she gets to a city she starts up a delivery service. The film shows her delivering various items and making friends along the way in particular a baker who lends Kiki a spare room, Ursula, an artist and Tombo a boy who admires Kiki but whom she initially isn't too keen on.Later on she begins to lose what skills she has and starts to worry that she will never get them back but when they are needed she finds she can fly once more.This review is based on the Japanese version with English subtitles, as I've not watched the English dub I can't say if it is as good.",Kiki's Delivery Service
7,BA_Harrison,For teenage girls and fans of bloomers.,4,20 October 2013,"Kiki is a thirteen year old witch who leaves home with her cat Jiji to train as a full witch and discover her special power. After finding a place to live at a baker's shop, Kiki begins making deliveries on her broomstick to pay her way. Shortly thereafter, she forms friendships with friendly artist Ursula and local boy Tombo, but becomes worried when she starts to lose her ability to flyThis is only the second Miyazaki/Studio Ghibli film I have seen (the other being Spirited Away), but so far I really cannot understand what all the fuss is about: once again, the plot is extremely flimsy, but it is also saccharine sweet (some would say charming; I don't!) and moves at a snail's pace. And although the animation is lovingly detailed and imaginatively directed, it's not nearly enough to relieve the boredom.Oh, and there's rather a lot of sneaky shots of Kiki's bloomers, but then I suppose this IS a Japanese film...",Kiki's Delivery Service
8,Quinoa1984,"light-hearted and adorable, if not one of Miyazaki's 'major' works",8,25 May 2008,"Kiki's Delivery Service would very likely be one of my favorite films, if I were 11 years old and a girl. But, as I am a 24 year old male, seeing the film for the first time, I can only recommend it to that age group, or something along those lines. It is a sweet coming-of-age fable where Kiki, a young witch-in-training (and, apparently, in a world where witches are seen with respected awe, and at worst as traffic violators) who with her cat Gigi moves into a baker's attic and starts up a delivery service- express by way of her broom- and meets some people like a female artist in a woodsy cabin, and a boy her own age.That it isn't one of the director Hayao Miyazaki's best features may or may not come as a surprise to viewers. It wasn't originally a work that started with him, as he inherited it as something from another director and writer that didn't quite formulate the right way. Under Miyazaki's hands it's got the visual panache and human sensitivity to characters that still marks this as a worthwhile effort for him to tackle. But there's also a lack of conflict that marks it as something almost TOO light-hearted, even for Miyazaki who's own My Neighbor Totoro is perhaps the greatest 'light-hearted' animated children's film ever created. There's something fluffy, even in the midst of the climactic rescue mission, that keeps things a little more narrow in light of the audience; girls may cherish it, but the boys may want to hitch on to Porco Rosso or Princess Mononoke, and unlike Spirited Away there isn't a very high artistic goal met.It is, however, as successful as it can be, and even as a minor work from this filmmaker it stands above most other animated features by possibly talented craftsmen who are limited in means of expressing delightful characters and something truly relatable for a child. There's wonder, fun, and even a scene with the cat and a dog that feels like a quick gag on old Looney Tunes. One more note - the Disney dub, which has been put down by many, actually isn't too bad, and Hartman especially makes Gigi seem somewhat more likable than another actor could've done.",Kiki's Delivery Service
9,Boba_Fett1138,A real fun and adventurous movies to watch.,8,25 April 2009,"This movie is really pleasant to watch. It's a Japanes anime that isn't set in a strange or futuristic world but still has the very same magic and charm of basically any other Hayao Miyazaki. It's also just as imaginative and adventurous.The movie has actually a very simple concept and story of a young witch-girl leaving home to find a town for her own to live in, like is customary for a with of her age. What follows is a movie filled with some adventures situations, really likable characters and a coming-of-age story.Yes, the movie can perhaps foremost be seen as a coming-of-age story, since the young girl struggles with fitting in, being happy and of course love. It's not a movie that has a villain in it but instead focuses purely on its main character and all of her struggles and small adventures. The movie is set at a real charming place, that perhaps reminded me the most of France. Also the style of the movie and its story, as well as its music, seemed to have some France movie influences in it. All of the events that happen within this movie are actually quite little and seem insignificant but yet you're fully drawn into it. It's pure movie magic!What of course helps to make the movie so charming, next to its settings and sweet little story, are its characters. The movie has some really likable and foremost simple characters. Especially the black cat as the movie its comical relief is just great. At first I thought; Oh no, not another talking animal! But he really made the movie real hilarious at times.The animation was also great looking. It was detailed in basically all parts and aspects and the character movements went fluently, something that just isn't always the case within a Japanese anime. I especially liked the way the entire town got portrayed. It made the entire place seem like such a great place and truly as a place you wanted to visit or perhaps even life in.A great movie for all ages!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Kiki's Delivery Service
10,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Delivers,8,15 October 2010,"Set decades ago in an alternate reality where the two World Wars never happened, this is about an impulsive, 13-year-old witch(note that this isn't full of creatures or spells) who, having reached that age, has to go out into the world and try to make it without her parents. In a new city, she starts her own air courier service and befriends Waldo before he embarked on a career of hiding from children in books and on TV. This is not for everyone; it can be pretty goofy and silly(I personally didn't care for it; however, I can recognize a great piece of work when I see it), and the worldview is extremely positive(everyone is happy, cheery and helpful people). The pacing is fitting, as this is full of child-like energy. Good points are made, and many of them subtly, with hints and without heavy-handedness. There is a lot of quirk to the characters. Some of the dialog and actions are realistic. The animation is smooth, and it builds mood and atmosphere, it makes the universe we're visiting here seem real. This has a fairly abrupt ending, and it could have been longer than 98 minutes. The climax and other bits are exciting. There are lines and shots that will make Puritan parents squirm in their seats in this. The DVD comes with trailers for this, My Neighbor Totoro, Howl's Moving Castle and Chihiro and Spirited Away. I recommend this to any fan of Miyazaki. 8/10",Kiki's Delivery Service
11,morrison-dylan-fan,Special Delivery.,8,13 August 2014,"With a friend having recently mentioned about being in the mood to watch an animated film,I started to look at a pile of DVDs laying by the side of my TV,and I noticed a movie by writer/directing auteur Hayao Miyazaki that I had been meaning to re-watch for the last 3 years!,which led to me deciding that it was about time.that I finally met up with Kiki again.The plot:Note:this is the English dubbed version.Since having recently turned 13,Kiki decides that it is time to leave home so that she can start training to become a fully grown up witch.Taking her cat Jiji along,Kiki waves goodbye to her family,and begins looking for a new city to live in,whilst travelling on a broomstick.Taken by the beautiful view from above,Kiki decides to live in a city called Koriko.Looking round for a place to stay in Koriko,Kiki meets the owner of a bakery shop called Osono,who kindly tells Kiki that she can stay in the spare bedroom for free,as long as she occasionally helps out at the bakery. Impressed by Kiki's generosity (and her broom-flying skills!) Osono helps Kiki to set up a delivery business,which involves Kiki (and Jiji) delivering items via broom.As she starts to take her first delivery,Kiki begins to enter the adult world.View on the film:Taking the extremely daring approach of not including a single baddie in the film,co-writer/ (along with uncredited writers Nobuyuki Isshiki and Sunao Katabuchi) director Hayao Miyazaki gives this adaptation of Eiko Kadono's novel a tremendous boys own (or in this case,girls own!) adventure feel,with the residences of Koriko warming to Kiki giving the movie a strong whimsical atmosphere.Placing Kiki's rites of passage at the centre of the movie,the writers show a fantastic skill in using Jiji to deliver some charming one-liners,whilst making sure that Kiki's progression into adulthood never becomes overly stern or sour.Whilst the animation surprisingly does not have the sketch-style detail featured in Miyazaki's other work, Miyazaki gives the film a great sense of melancholy,thanks to Miyazaki covering the city in fading water colours.Along with the fading water colours of the city, Miyazaki uses broad brush stokes for the character animation,which along with giving each of the characters a lively look,also perfect expresses the adventure book mood getting built by Miyazaki.Sadly featuring his last ever performance,Phil Hartman delivers a tremendous performance as Jiji,with Hartman making Jiji bounce off ever corner of the bakery with his hilarious one-liners.Giving Kiki a sweet innocence, Kirsten Dunst gives a wonderful performance,with Dunst expressing Kiki transfer into adulthood with a perfect nervousness,as Kiki and the film fly into the night.",Kiki's Delivery Service
12,zetes,One of the greatest children's films ever made,10,29 July 2000,"This ranks up there with Pinocchio as the greatest movie for children ever made. One huge problem with most animated children's films are that the plots are so conventional and often contain very 1950s ideals for society that they become detrimental to society. One's childhood is the most impressionable time in their life, so movies that are directed towards them teach them what places different sorts of people play in society. There is a very humorous, but also very serious bit of dialogue in a film called The Last Days of Disco where characters discuss the effects Lady and the Tramp could have on little girls, depicting a young female dog falling for a vagabond Tramp. This, they muse, sets young women up to fall for rebellious men later in life. This may seem like a humorous idea, but it's absolutely true. Even good Disney movies give children these standards. As nice as The Little Mermaid or Beauty and the Beast or Cinderella or Snow White and the Seven Dwarves may be, they basically teach that it is the woman's place to grow up and get married, prefereably to a handsome rich man (perhaps the rich part is never said, but both the main male characters in these films do happen to own  castles). The writers of these films probably had no idea that that is what they were doing, but it is.That is why Pinocchio is the best Disney movie. It is probably the only Disney animated film that I can think of that actually concerns the predicament of its target audience: children. I can hardly think of a single (American) animated film besides it that has a child as its main character (oh, the Jungle Book, which is also excellent). Then comes Kiki's Delivery Service. It is an absolutely perfect movie about a young girl out on her own trying to handle the responsibilities of life. It is, in my opinion, the best movie that a child can watch. And not only will it teach children, it is also marvelously animated, directed, and written. There is a plethora of great characters, exciting moments, and imaginative situations. It should also expand a child's mind, not only because of the imagination involved, which will help to break children away from conventions in their film experience, thus making them more intelligent, but because it comes from another culture. It doesn't overtly show its Japaneseness, unless you count the imagination involved (though you should count that as a credit towards Hayao Miyazaki, who is the greatest genius of animation as far as I'm concerned). But it may spark an interest in children old enough to understand that someone from another country made it. Also, for younger kids, Miyazaki's fantastic, equally good My Neighbor Totoro. 10/10(ps: I have only seen the dubbed version of this film. I find it perfectly acceptable and great. Nothing made me cringe, anyway. I think Kirsten Dunst did a very good job characterizing Kiki, a much better job than Claire Danes did characterizing San from Princess Mononoke.)",Kiki's Delivery Service
13,Mr-Fusion,Delivers the goods,7,3 August 2017,"Thoroughly likable story of self-purpose and acceptance with Studio Ghibli's usual flair for picturesque seaside locals (these movies are never an eyesore). Like ""Totoro"", ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" has little in the way of conflict and moves like a cool breeze, but is rich in character (kinda surprising how much personality can be found in an impudent black cat).This is just about the most good-natured thing I've seen in a while. Plenty of heart.7/10",Kiki's Delivery Service
14,siderite,"Nice happy feel good anime, but finishing abruptly",7,24 January 2006,"I've seen better. It is very nice, the animation is perfect and the feelings it gives you are very nice indeed, but when you get down to it it's has little to do with the fact that the girl is a witch, but more with her spirit. The entire witch thing is merely a pretext and could have been missing completely, making this the least fantastic Miyazaki film I've seen.The ending also bothers me. It brings one into the atmosphere of the film then it's over. Of course, this is due to the moral of the movies always being in the end in the American movies I am used to see rather than in the entire film like in this one, but still... I wanted more.I accidentally saw that they are planning a movie after this due to be released in 2006, no doubt trying to capitalize on the whole Harry Potter thing. I hope they don't ruin it too much.",Kiki's Delivery Service
15,cherold,Fun little movie,8,2 June 2021,"Kiki's Delivery Service gives us a world pretty much like ours except there are witches and at 13 they fly to a random town and ""train."" I put train in quotes because while Kiki says she's going to train and later says she's been training it's unclear what this training consists of. Unlike other witches who have special powers, Kiki's only power is broom flying so she gets a delivery job.The movie is a little insubstantial, often episodic and with a rather abrupt ending, but it is funny and charming and keeps you entertained. I'm not sure it *quite* makes my 10 5 Miyazaki films but it probably makes my top 7. Definitely something you should see.",Kiki's Delivery Service
16,ElMaruecan82,The perfect combination of magical flying and a down-to-earth coming-of-age story...,10,23 July 2017,"The misfortune of Hayao Miyazaki's ""Kiki Delivery's Service"" is its release the same year than Walt Disney's ""Little Mermaid"". Disney Renaissance wasn't definitely established and Miyazaki wasn't totally unknown, his ""Nausicaa"" and ""My Neigbor Totoro"" pleased both audiences and critics although their commercial success was notable at best, but there's something of a 'missed opportunity' in Kiki.Indeed, everyone praised ""Princess Mononoke"" and ""Spirited Away"" as Miyazaki's greatest achievements but to put it simply, the 1989 offering of Stuido Ghibli is nothing short of masterful. It might not play in the same league of escapist fantasy than the story of a little mermaid who dreams to discover the world of humans, but this is a field Miyazaki isn't interested in. He doesn't explore a witch story to satisfy some enthusiastic craving for magic and special effects, his maturity flies over predictability. And what Miyazaki accomplishes is a little miracle: a witch story set in a realistic environment, with a set of rules and limitations Kiki must either obey or overcome, and fantasy as a set-up but not an excuse for plot contrivances.""Kiki Delivery Service"" can in fact be regarded as a reverse ""Spirited Away"". While the 2001 journey involved a 'normal' girl evolving in a fantasy universe, Kiki is a 13-year old trainee witch who must find her place in the real world. Her age is obviously a nod to adolescence (the most suitable life chapter for a coming-of-age story) where Kiki will fit in the tough 'normality' of the world and learn the value of hard work, independence and interactions with kids of her age, especially Tombo, a geeky little boy passionate about aviation and Kiki's flying skills. By the way, her magical broom is the only concession made to fantasy archetypes, otherwise, Kiki is as 'limited' and 'normal' than any girl.And that's precisely what makes her evolution so captivating. Kiki looks like a living archetype with the broom, the black dress she must be wearing, not to mention the black cat, a funny little sidekick named Jiji, but at the same time, she has many 'average girl' attitudes, she hates her dress and wears a big pink bow as an accessory. She's not even your typical anguish outsider, she comes from a very loving family and everyone celebrates her departure from the village to discover the world, as a ritual for every witch at the age of 13. Miyazaki intended to make Kiki the embodiment of little Tokyo girls in transitional phase, looking for emancipation.And it doesn't take a Harvard philosophy degree to see in her flying, less a magical power than a real metaphor of girls' emancipation over the burdens of tradition. It might even symbolize Miyazaki's own emancipation from the usual archetypes of animation as his story features no villain, it doesn't overplay the magical elements, Kiki doesn't go to some sorcerer's school à la Harry Potter, but she'll learn to accommodate her powers with a real place in the world by providing a delivery service for a gentle pregnant baker named Osono... and many other things. There's a mix of escapism and realism that could have been a real revolution if it wasn't for thunder-stealer Disney. Yet, the more I saw Kiki (four times in the same weekend) the more old- fashioned ""Little Mermaid"" appeared.Indeed, Ariel starts as a girl who wants to get off the sea, but once she (literally) sets the foot in human world, her quest turns into a romance with Prince Eric. Kiki might be younger than Ariel, but what Miyazaki offers us is all the steps between childhood and youth: finding your path, your role, your place and gaining enough self-esteem to open yourself to people. The arrival in the city contains many interesting elements such as Kiki's enthusiasm being immediately spoiled by people's carelessness and a policeman's anger. But once Tombo approaches her, she's shown as capable of rejection and their relationship will take time to build.And as usual in Miyazaki's world, like in all the anime I grew up, there are many scenes that (on a script level) shows nothing ""special"", scenes involving Kiki buying furniture, giving money, asking for receipt, scenes where she goes to the bathroom, scenes that have no other intent than setting the story in realistic world and highlighting the maturity of Ghibli studios over Disney, where even static moments are hypnotic. Time is also capital in the way it can affect Kiki's self-confidence and undermine her power. Miyazaki took liberties with the original story was made of little episodes and needed stronger ordeals for Kiki, and what worse for a witch than losing the ability to fly?That moment is paralleled with a similar story that happened to her friend, a young painter named Ursula, who went through an artist block, and realized it helped her to put in more discipline in her work, to find herself, her voice and style. Losing the ability to fly and communicate with her cat will cause Kiki to lose confidence, but it will also help her to overcome her own personal demons and be able to fit within the others, by staying true to herself and in the process, save Tombo during the film's climax. And in this time where female power is evoked, it's interesting to note that the heroine is a female and she's the one who ends up saving the boy, I don't know if she was meant to be feminist but she genuinely is.If there's ever a world I would associate with ""Kiki Delivery Service"", it's emancipation, Kiki discovering the world, overcoming her demons and Miyazaki showing that even in the most banal settings, he could draw the most beautiful and poetic stories, proving that Japan wasn't just the land of the rising sun but of a rising awareness of what animation should stand for: beautiful, mesmerizing but respecting people's intelligence, adults and kids.",Kiki's Delivery Service
17,paul2001sw-1,Beautiful but Disneyfied,5,3 September 2013,"I usually like Hayao Miakazi's animations, and this film, one of his earliest efforts, has much to commend it, most particularly its beautiful (and beautifully detailed) European city setting. Unofortunately, the plot is pure Disney, about a plucky young girl's quest to find herself and win the affections of a local boy. I don't know how much of an effect watching a version dubbed into American has on the mood of the piece: what is clear is that the result is predictable and affirmative in its message. Miazaki's other films ('Porco Rosso' and 'Princess Monoake', for example) have more depth and moral complexity to them: this one is just as gorgeous, but somewhat trite.",Kiki's Delivery Service
18,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Prime air.,7,26 February 2020,"'Kiki's Delivery Service (1989)' feels very classically 'Ghibli', with a sweet, wholesome outlook and a laid-back, almost meandering pace. It focuses on the eponymous Kiki, a thirteen-year-old witch who sets out on her own to finish her training. The story itself is very... mundane, I suppose. Everything is treated with a normalcy seldom seen in this kind of stuff; only the occasional gasp sets Kiki's flying broom apart from a regular bus, for example. This works well for the piece, which is much more concerned with its central character's struggle to find herself away from home than it is with any particular magical outing. It's a coming-of-age flick at its core. It isn't overly sentimental or filled with angst, though. It simply presents the ups and downs of, essentially, moving out (to a new city, no less) with as much urgency as it deems fit. The movie's most 'spectacular' event occurs during its finale, before which a more traditional plot has only just begun to take hold. In fact, the thing ends where most would think to begin - or, at least, continue. This speaks to the unique pacing of the picture. It's clearly more concerned with character than traditional narrative. Despite this, the film is animated wonderfully, each frame leaving you wide-eyed and beaming. It perfectly encapsulates what's so good about animation in any style: it gets you to believe in and care about a series of drawings. Even if the affair isn't massively compelling or enthralling, it's always enjoyable. It's the sort of cinema that makes you smile. As I've said before, sometimes that's enough. 7/10",Kiki's Delivery Service

She is such a warrior for a 13 year old teenage girl, like I wasn't close to being that confident at that age lol! Seriously though she is so brave for leaving home so early and being independent! I'm sure 13 year olds or even grown ups watching this would be also quite jealous of Kiki's freedom of getting away from reality!I loved Jiji too, he's like such a droll and a smart sidekick! Poor Phil Hartman was such a legend doing that role, I loved how he was so into doing his character right. I wish he had to do more anime roles. I wish he was alive today to see his successes. RIP 💟I certainly enjoyed this film, I would show this to anybody of any age! Although the only disadvantage of seeing this movie is really the image quality so make sure you don't get blinded!",Kiki's Delivery Service
22,CuriosityKilledShawn,"Nice, but pointless",6,19 June 2005,"While I understand all of Hayao Miyazaki's work cannot be heavy, 2 hour-plus epics, this is the lamest of all his films. Don't get me wrong, I like it. But there isn't really a lot of story or character to make a feature length film out of.I watched the English dub with Kirsten Dunst doing the voice of Kiki and the late, great Phil Hartman doing her talking cat Jiji. Much like Sabrina The Late-Thirties Teenage Witch, Jiki is black, cynical and funny. He provides most of the film's laughs and is impossibly cute.As I have said, the film is very light. So light it could float in the air without the need for a broomstick. Nothing is really made a big deal of and no real story develops. What gives the film class is Miyazaki's attention to detail and gorgeous production design. Kiki exists in a perfect, transethnical European town with wonderful architecture and scenery. The flying scenes look brilliant and the colors are always bright and cheerful.Still, no-matter how pretty and easy-going, it doesn't have that long-lasting appeal of Nausicaa or Castle of Cagliostro.",Kiki's Delivery Service
23,sol-,My brief review of the film,1,25 October 2005,"It is interesting to note that this film was not written directly by Miyazaki, nor was it is based on anything of his creation. It is, atypically, adapted from the work of a different writer, and therefore some of the differences between this film and other Miyazaki works can be found to have a source. As for the film itself, it has some fun characters, such as the cat, and it is a light and enjoyable ride. However, it is deathly predictable, and there is hardly a story behind it. The film is more so events slotted together, rather than linear story. There is little character motivation, with no definite quest, goal or anything, unlike in Miyazaki's other films. In fact, it almost seems as if love is motivating Kiki. One of the most beautiful elements usually in a Miyazaki film is how a boy and girl can have a friendship without it having to go into the love territory. However, such a territory is welcomed in this film, which makes it a tad clichéd. The other problem is that our protagonist is presented as nothing special. Being a witch is normal in the context of the film, so it is vexing that the characters find her so amazing when she does little that is extraordinary. There seems to be a lot to pick on in this film, and maybe I am judging it too harshly? It is a good film, and pleasant viewing, but I cannot place it in the same league as Miyazaki's best works.",Kiki's Delivery Service
24,briancham1994,Lighthearted,8,24 August 2020,"Compared to Studio Ghibli's output, this film is quite lighthearted and would be suited for younger audiences.

""adult situations."" No, we were bamboozled by people who were only fooling themselves, Disney didn't ""do"" anime. Uh-huh. I love some of Miyazaki's movies- KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE being probably my favorite (thanks in no small part to that furry bag of pudding, Jiji the black cat, Kiki's ever-present familiar).

The scripts are totally banal and unnatural with nothing that makes me feel any emotion or humour. I find the dialogue boring and idiotic to be honest.Yes the animation is what must attract people mainly I guess but is it just me or is it no better than the weird cartoons I used to watch on kids TV in the 80s like Ulysees, City of Gold or Thundercats? I just would accept it as a kid in the 80s and it is not terrible but while quirky it is neither clever nor realistic nor beautiful. I am not impressed.The stories are mostly weird. In this case it is very odd in that it is so lacking in any events which constitute even a moderately good enough plot for a 15 minute kids cartoon! Nothing happens! It is boring and pointless. I had no interest whatsoever in the characters or what they were doing. Just my opinion.",Kiki's Delivery Service
28,freemantle_uk,A Charming Family Film,9,21 February 2014,"Hayao Miyazaki is a legend of Japanese animation and he has made many delightful films, including his coming-of-age fantasy Kiki's Delivery Service.Set in a world that is cross between Europe and America in both the 50s and 80s Kiki (Minami Takayama) is a 13-year-old witch who decides to complete her rite-of-passage that witches need to complete by leaving home for a year so she can become a fully fledged witch. With her talking cat Jiji (Rei Sakuma) she settles down with a friendly pregnant baker, Osono (Keiko Toda) and uses her flying skills to set up a delivery business. Whilst away from home Kiki makes friends also has to overcome her self-doubts as she tries to help everyone she meets.Kiki's Delivery Service is a charming, delightful film that is filled with wit and humour whilst also being very heartfelt as a young girl tries to make her way in the film. As you would expect from Miyazaki the animation is beautiful, colourful and detailed and they is a rich world building, giving us a wonderfully eclectic world of geography and time- period. There is plenty verbal and visual humour to please all the family and has an engaging simple story about a girl who rushes to grow up but finds out the journey and reality is much harder then she imagined.Filled with excellent music and Miyazaki signature style and look Kiki's Delivery Service is a lovely little film for the whole family. Whilst Spirited Away is still my favourite Miyazaki film but they is a richness in the simplicity of this film.",Kiki's Delivery Service
29,dee.reid,"Special Delivery - ""Kiki's Delivery Service""",10,19 August 2010,"The great Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki wrote and directed ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" in 1989, a Japanese Anime' (Japanese animation) picture that doesn't talk down to its primary target audience of children, nor does it play stupid to the adults also caught watching it. It's one of the rare animated films, Japanese or American, that can be wholly enjoyed by anyone of any age, and those individuals will not feel pandered to.All in all, ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" is a wondrously animated film. A lot of Anime' is aimed at the mature-minded and teenagers, because Anime' tends to contain a lot of explicit sex and violence with thematically deep subject matter. But Hayao Miyazaki is good at creating films that are great for all audiences, even if some (like 1997's ""PG-13""-rated ""Princess Mononoke"") can push the limits a little bit with sudden, shocking bursts of violence and frightening/disturbing imagery.Thankfully, ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" has none of that, and is one of the few Anime' films that has great cross-generational/cross-cultural appeal for people of all ages. And it also has a great message about responsibility and growing up. This may come as a surprise for people watching a movie that asks us to sympathize with, above all else, a 13-year-old witch, the titular Kiki (voiced in the dubbed American version of the film by Kirsten Dunst).The Japanese must have a radically different view of witches and witchcraft than Americans do, because this is one of the few animated films about witches that I can recall where we're asked to make this sort of emotional connection with them, much less have them be featured as the story's protagonists. For Kiki, being 13-years-old and a witch means being at a crossroads in life. So she decides to become a full-fledged witch by journeying to a far-off community for a year-long apprenticeship with her smart-talking cat Jiji (the late Phil Hartman) in tow.She soon winds up at a small seaside community and the bakery/home of Osano (Tress MacNeille, ""The Simpsons"") who takes her in and soon lets her help out around the house. Soon, Kiki is inspired to open up her own delivery service in Osano's house, and this allows the young witch to take some responsibility and find her own place in life. Along the way, she befriends the painter Ursula (comedienne Janeane Garofalo) and the nerdy Tombo (Matthew Lawrence), the latter of whom is a local boy who may or may not have a crush on her and harbors dreams of aviation on his propeller-outfitted bicycle.""Kiki's Delivery Service"" is such a sweet little film; you don't really hear the words ""sweet"" and ""Anime'"" mentioned very much in the same sentence. Hayao Miyazaki's story soars and so do the voice performers (he always has a knack for choosing top-of-the-line talent for the American dubs of his films). The film can easily be enjoyed by anybody of any age on either side of the Pacific Ocean; that's an undeniable fact. I'm 24, and much of the Anime' I watch is pretty mature-minded and themed (for the last three days, I've been watching ""Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade"" pretty much non-stop), but that fact hasn't stopped me at all from enjoying any of Miyazaki's films. (In fact, my favorite animated film of all time, American or Japanese, is his own ""Spirited Away."")Miyazaki's film here doesn't feature any of the typical stuff that's normally associated with witches in the West, like spells, cauldron's, etc. Instead, Miyazaki's story opts for a much more simplistic and light-hearted approach that almost makes the film seem like a child's fantasy come to life brilliantly through animation. I know I've said it plenty of times already, but his take on the story of a young witch allows it to cross the entire age range whether you're American or Japanese. And the film's coming-of-age message is instantly empathetic to anyone who watches it and the message doesn't play stupid to anyone in the audience, no matter what their age is.I know I'm probably a little bit premature, but this is probably one of the best (if not the best) animated children's films I've ever seen. Kirsten Dunst (who I'm used to seeing as Mary Jane Watson in the ""Spider-Man"" movies) is the movie's best voice performer. The fact that one of her nicknames is, incredibly enough, ""Kiki,"" made her the best candidate for the role of the plucky young heroine of Hayao Miyazaki's great little children's tale.10/10",Kiki's Delivery Service
30,drqshadow-reviews,A Wonderful Dose of Escapist Fantasy,7,6 May 2019,"Breezy, cheerful adventures with a thirteen-year-old witch (and her sarcastic talking cat) who leaves home to find her place in a new town. It's big-hearted and welcoming, as can be said of most of the Studio Ghibli catalog - colorful and fuzzy and full of life - but suffers from a lack of adversity and thus, falls a bit on the flat side. Self-doubt and adolescent shyness are her only major foils, and while those are worth exploring, they feel more like side acts than a main course.Still, it's a delightful place to inhabit, a nice break from the doom and gloom of the outside world, and I enjoyed myself despite the relative superficiality. Kiki is a charming protagonist, bold and ambitious but also delicate and reluctant, and it's inspiring to watch her horizons broaden as she encounters different personalities and grows to love the coastal city she's chosen for her new home. A wonderful dose of escapism and fantasy, it's decidedly (perhaps intentionally?) light fare.",Kiki's Delivery Service
31,GiraffeDoor,Its writer's best,8,5 November 2019,"I'm tempted to say this is the best of its writer's movies.There's something magical in this little picture. Without even the grandiosity of Mononoke or Spirited Away, they created a charming vision of a youth moving out into the world that is simply revitalizing. It is one of those features you watch in the summer holidays and makes you want to put your whole life in perspective; that profundity of the adult world from the perspective of a preteen.The whole thing uses charm and character with a vivid sense of place and time. It doesn't even matter which place and time with its continental architecture and streets, the vintage aura and just the right tonality of the whole thing where difficulties are over come and our heroine gloriously discovers herself.Thinking back over it there are indeed some negatives. There are maybe one two too many coincidences and it annoys me when we have the male-pursuing-female paradigm of love interest. Even if the girl is the freaking protagonist. Maybe this is a personal neuroses I shouldn't take out on the movie; it's a small thing really.Another thing is something I notice in most of ol' Hayao's movies: there is something...parental about this flick. Yeah, the 12 year old is moving out to the city and practising witch craft but it almost seems like propaganda to tell you to get a job rather than enjoy summer vacation. It doesn't spoil the movie, it's just something I've thought about since first viewing.However, a lot of Hayao's bad habits are thankfully avoided. Kiki is not obnoxious or sanctimonious. She may have been kind of snooty to that boy (I'm confused why, it just seems like Victorian prudishness to me) but she is a very likeable person just trying to go it alone. The plot may seem fragmented at times, but it's supposed to be life. Thinking about the movie reminds me of when I left home for university no longer living in a small town but an exciting city.We actually get a climax for once; the whole thing builds and comes to together in a super satisfying way.This will always be a movie that will just replenish me when I forget what the point of it all is. Of all the permutations of the Miyazakian formula, this one just got it right.",Kiki's Delivery Service
32,MissSimonetta,Classic coming-of-age story,10,11 July 2014,"Out of all of the films of my childhood, Kiki's Delivery Service (1989) has held up the best. Though its main character is a teenaged girl, anyone of any age can relate to her struggles to achieve independence and find her place in the frightening adult world. Having no villain, pop culture-based jokes, overdone character development, or gross-out humor like most contemporary family films, this one feels more memorable and timeless as a result.For me, Kiki is the most relate-able of the Ghibli protagonists, despite her having magic powers. Being socially awkward and far from trendy, I can understand her alienation and feelings of inferiority when Tombo tries to get her to socialize with his rowdy friends. Then again, I think anyone who's ever been the new student or new kid in town can relate to that. All the characters in the film feel like people you could come across in real life and that makes this charming movie all the more special. That it is also a beautifully animated film is only icing on the cake.",Kiki's Delivery Service

She will need to find a place where no one knows her and to support herself while becoming a full-fledged witch - just like her mother did when she was 13. It's a charming as well as highly entertaining story of self-discovery, taking responsibilities, becoming independent and mature, and following and achieving one's dreams. The film is (I will not be original and just repeat what countless reviews have said already) breathtakingly beautiful. I've been watching movies all my life, and I've seen thousands but rarely have I wanted to stay and live in the imaginative movie's world. Hayao Miyazaki's kind and magical, lovely and sweet without being sappy or patronizing animation made me dream of the place like Korico. I did not want to leave the romantic magic seaside town that Kiki and her ironic talking black cat Jiji chose to stay, where everyone (well, almost) seems to respect, like, and to help to one another, where Kiki established reliable ""Witch Express Delivery"" using her flying skills and where ""the things are sometimes difficult but she is fine"". Yes, I wanted to stay in the dreamy sparkling world that Hayao Miyazaki created by the gentle power of his incomparable talent.I want to join millions of grateful viewers and to thank Walt Disney Company for having introduced the films of Hayao Miyazaki to the rest of the world.

Fitting into her new home proves to be difficult but she soon finds her niche as a flying delivery girl.Unsurprisingly for Studio Ghibli, the story is a highly imaginative one. It may seem somewhat slight in comparison to other offerings from the studio but it will still grab your attention and contains some touching moments to boot. In the end, though, I did feel that some intangible ingredient was lacking in comparison with other Miyazaki films.The voice cast for the Disney dub is better than I expected and doesn't really have any questionable choices, except perhaps Phil Hartman as Jiji the cat. Kirsten Dunst's performance as Kiki is a stand-out.The visual element is quite impressive, as usual for Studio Ghibli, and the score is better than I expected given Disney's tampering with it. Even the English-language opening and closing themes don't seem out of place.This is the most light-weight of the Miyazaki films that I've seen but that doesn't mean that it's not enjoyable.

41,blott2319-1,An adorable movie for kids,5,2 September 2020,"Kiki's Delivery Service feels like one of those movies that they would show us in elementary school when it was raining and we couldn't go outside for recess. It's cute, and certainly feels like it will appeal to children, but doesn't have much that interests me as a middle-aged man. There is a paper-thin story in this movie, and it doesn't follow much of a narrative path. A lot of the movie feels episodic, and I wonder if Miyazaki considered making this a children's TV series. Each little adventure could be its own episode, since they don't flow like a film script would normally. The world created in Kiki's Delivery Service is similar to our own, but here we see that the existence of witches is widely known, and not considered fantastical to them.It is a little odd that, at such a young age, this character is allowed to go fend for herself in a big city, but this isn't the kind of film where there are antagonists looking to hurt the young girl. In this magical world, pretty much everyone is nice and tries to help, with the exception of some bratty kids. Kiki meets a lot of friends along the way, and it seems that there's no real conflict in the film at all. Then out of nowhere, for no apparent reason Kiki hits a roadblock. I didn't quite understand the purpose of this part of the film, other than manufacturing drama for the final scene. While all I've said might sound overly mean-spirited, I didn't have any animosity towards Kiki's Delivery Service. The word that kept coming to mind was ""cute.""

43,Andy-296,Wonderful animated feature by Miyazaki,9,18 January 2007,"Hayao Miyazaki animated feature of a 13-old year witch leaving his parents and settling in a new town to form a (broom-based) delivery service is irresistible. As in many of his movies, the protagonist here is a plucky heroine defying all odds. What I found most enjoyable about the movie - though - is its background details. Miyazaki loves European culture - and the movie is set in never land Europe - a fantasized Europe that never existed. A lot of the clothes and the technology suggests the 1950s and the 1960s - but filtered through Miyazaki's sensibility (there are a number of anachronistic details that suggest perhaps a mid-20th century Europe if World War II had never happened). Miyazaki uses a lot of different sources in his movies - and they not always coalesce. In Porco Rosso, they didn't (Fascist Italy + Aviation Aces + Flying Pig?). But here they do.",Kiki's Delivery Service
44,sharky_55,Majo no takkyûbin,9,15 July 2016,"If there ever was a missed opportunity in Miyazaki's oeuvre, it was having Kiki settle down above a bakery and have almost zero depiction of the arts of creating bread. Miyazaki has always been known for his attention to detail, and this is most notable on an empty stomach. From the viscosity of the egg whites and yolk in Howl's Moving Castle, to the great towering feasts in Spirited Away, he makes food memorable. It is not just a source of sustenance, but a hearty and delicious experience in itself. Where were the scenes of Kiki, sleeves rolled up and determined expression, kneading and working the dough as if her life depended on it (her accommodation does)? Where is the shot of the glowing coals in the oven turning rows of bread golden? Granted, we do see a herring pie being lovingly crafted. The end result of this dish, however, is the abrupt realisation of the brattiness of some girls her age - it's an important moment of growth for Kiki, who has been struggling to make ends meet and on the verge of feeling sorry for herself.So, while the civilised society of the larger city may marvel and gasp at her flight, there is a secondary layer to examine here; the surprise that a thirteen year old is already out surviving on her own. Kiki's entire existence contradicts what the people of Koriko believe, that children her age should still be building toys to play with and having parties and gifts showered upon them. Miyazaki has embedded this theme of early blossoming and coming-of-age well, so that it becomes universal rather than just an examination of a witch's unique journey. Kiki's challenges don't manifest in mastering magic spells or concocting problems, but rather those that most people will need to face sooner rather than later; making her own living, managing her finances and meals, taking responsibility for her own mistakes. In the beginning Kiki favours the smaller, fashionable broom over her mother's, which is larger and bulkier, although safer. We see that even within the witch community we have divas - a brief appearance from a snide, prettied up witch whose skill has already been realised. This is revealed to be fortune telling, specifically in the domain of love and romance. I love this little detail because Miyazaki doesn't ever feel the need to explain the legitimacy of her talent. It's left up in the air, for Kiki and the audience to judge for themselves; is being told where your love life's future lies all that valuable? This question prompts the start of Kiki's self- evaluation. And later, we have something that momentarily shakes her; is delivery a more valuable and enriching talent, if it is to snobby brats that deride gifts from their loving grandmother? Kiki's Delivery Service is as technically proficient as any Miyazaki and Ghibli feature, who have continually raised the bar for animation for years and years. The idyllic coastal town is made beautiful with stunning overhead shots from Kiki's perspective, swooping in and out of the clouds and alongside migrating birds. Miyazaki has never shied away from exaggerated facial animations, from as early as Castle in the Sky; wide open grins, great belly laughs, the way character's eyes shimmer and widen in surprise and indignation. Wonderful stuff. And the English voice dub, overseen by Miyazaki himself, is as always top quality for a Ghibli feature. A young Kirsten Dunst brings such a nuanced vulnerability to a mere child forced to fend for herself. I'd even say it surpasses the original Japanese; there is moment after she finally delivers the herring pie in the rain, only to have its recipient not even be grateful, and realises that her wet clothes and lateness has made her miss the party. Osono tries to persuade her and lift her spirits, but she replies ""It doesn't matter anyway. I can't go in these wet clothes."" and there is just the slightest hit of a sob that Dunst holds in at the end of the sentence, but it is enough to tell us that she is close to breaking down. Another great little feature of the dub is the way that Tombo's (Matthew Lawrence) voice is chopped up by the rotating rotor as he tries to takeoff in the wind. What great care and attention to detail. My favourite moment is dear old Bertha in the hallway, who is making vroom vroom noises and pretending that she is young again and flying high amongst the skies. Even in the most unlikely of moments Miyazaki can find our inherent childhood.",Kiki's Delivery Service
45,rockman182,Kiki's Delivery Service (1989),8,16 June 2020,"I got HBO Max on premiere day for one reason: The Studio Ghibli films. I have probably seen only three or four in my life but had to check out the rest. I decided to go in order of release and experience them all. I will probably update the blog here with reviews (not of all of the films but the ones I really liked). Kiki's Delivery Service is already up there. Its so simple, cheery, and all around an unbelievably fun time. The last three Ghibli films I've seen have been stellar.
The film is about a young witch who is becoming independent, so she moves out of home with her friend (a talking cat) and tries to find her calling. While initially struggling to find a place to stay she finds residence with a nice lady at a bakery and gets a job delivering items to customers and running errands. The fact, that she can fly on a broomstick makes the task easy. However, managing time and responsibility become an issue along with the feeling of self doubt.
The animation in this film is so rich, vibrant, and timeless. Its a huge strength when the animation is so gorgeous and wondrous. Kiki is an identifiable character. She's positive and learning her way in the world. She is learning to become responsible, self sustaining, and learning to let people in. She has a conflict trying to believe in herself and her powers dissipate. You get the traditional imagination as you would see with a Miyazaki film and swift writing. Its such a simple film to follow and digest but it brings joy seeing it.
I have been impressed with everything I've seen so far. In the interest of time I won't be reviewing all. I will say that I greatly enjoyed Nausicaa and Castle in the Sky. Well written and politically and socially relevant. I will write reviews for Grave of the Fireflies (which was absolutely depressing) and My Neighbor Totoro (which was absolutely charming).

46,bryank-04844,"Kiki's Delivery Service' is a very endearing film with a lovable character who seems ordinary, but it's so much more.",7,11 August 2015,"Studio Ghibli has given us some of the best animated films to ever grace the big screen. And I would even put those animated features in the running for some of the best films in any category. From 'Spirited Away', 'Princess Mononoke', 'The Wind Rises', and 'Howl's Moving Castle', Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki have brought us some very interesting characters, excellent story lines, and some of the best 2D animation we've ever seen.It seems like all of these films are timeless and have a lasting effect, which is probably why all of these movies continue to be shown at special screening across the country. One of the first films from Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki was called 'Kiki's Delivery Service'. It premiered in Japan way back in 1989, but didn't make it to the USA until 1998, in which Disney bought the rights and dubbed the film into English with some A-list actors. No matter which version you watch, 'Kiki's Delivery Service' actually delivers a charming and simple story with excellent characters that will stick you for years to come. This is an excellent coming of age story, particularly for teenage girls. While Miyazaki might have told a very simple story with not a whole lot of action, like we've seen in his other films, he definitely hit the nail on the head with almost every emotion Kiki goes through as she is becoming a woman.The film centers on Kiki, a thirteen-year old girl who leaves goes on a year's quest to become a woman by herself. But she's no ordinary girl. She's in fact a witch, broom and all. KiKi must leave home to develop her witching skills and find out who she really is. She takes her pet cat Jiji whom she can have regular conversations with as they end up quaint little town that is as friendly as 'Stars Hollow' on 'Gilmore Girls'. To embrace and enhance her special skill, which is to fly gracefully and fast on a broom, she develops a delivery service with the help of the local bakers in town.Even though, she's a witch, and she has a few magical powers, Kiki is still a young teenage girl, and is struggling to talk to boys, particularly Tombo, and is trying to make friends. Three of her customers tend to give her life lessons, as they are three different women in different stages of their lives. One of them is an artist named Ursula, who coaches Kiki to learn from her fears and mistakes. This especially comes in to play when Kiki loses her ability to fly and talk with her cat Jiji. But over time and with a little confidence in herself, Kiki might just be the woman she set out to be. And that's the general gist of 'Kiki's Delivery Service'.I'm sure if this story was in someone else's hands, this teenage witch story would have had monsters, boiling pots of poison, and Gothic settings everywhere. But that's not the case here with Miyazaki's opus. There's not much at stake here really, other than Kiki going through adolescence, or healing from a cold, or trying to make new friends. It really is a breath of fresh air to see a story told like this with these simple view points.And the cast including Kirsten Dunst as Kiki and the late great Phil Hartman as Jiji the cat, along with Brad Garrett, Janeane Garofalo, Matthew Lawrence, and Debbie Reynolds all do a great job with their fun and emotional range they bring to the voices here. 'Kiki's Delivery Service' is a very endearing film with a lovable character who seems ordinary, but it's so much more. This is one of those films you'll want to add to your collection, no matter what age you are.",Kiki's Delivery Service
47,RResende,Myazaki searching Miyazaki,7,5 September 2007,"There are a few directors whose work is worth watching, no matter what they do. Miyazaki is one of those. He has a very personal and strong way to drive an audience and carry it to a world fully defined by the rules he creates. And the rules change from film to film. But they always include unreal (many times surreal) elements, translated into strange characters and physically impossible actions, at least in a Newtonian world. This is what today is called ""fantasy"". This so called fantasy has many expressions, which are more or less drifting between two main poles: that of ""show"" and that of ""contention"". Miyazaki is always contained, and thus emotionally intense (though many times he gets to produce spectacular imagery).This being said, i believe this is a minor work of his in terms of final product, but a very interesting one to analyze in the larger picture of his works. Here fantasy is not so present; we have a witch in a world of reality, our world. That world is made of people who get as fascinated by the witch as we do. In a way, the inhabitants of that village are a continuation, on screen, of us, audience. There are no true villains, except the ones our little hero finds inside her. So, we watch an inner struggle for self-accomplishment. Miyazaki is here someone trying to master the medium for which he knows he is talented, he can ""fly"", but he knows his road is long, and along the way he might have to make some ""delieveries services"". What he came to do after this one proves he learned the job. Here he was struggling, with himself and his ideas.Nevertheless this is not his most engaging work, since he doesn't master so well the capacity to fully deliver a coherent vision out of many unreal elements.Oh and this little Kiki is precisely the opposite of little Dorothy. This was a little girl from the ""real"" Kansas who made her ""fantasy"" visit to the dreamy Oz. Kiki is a fantasy girl who makes her way in a real world. Miyazaki once more.My evaluation: 3/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Kiki's Delivery Service
48,AhmedSpielberg99,Witches have never been so likable and relatable! And witchcraft has never been so mundane!,8,1 August 2019,"Slightly bogged down by occasionally going into some familiar territory (especially in its third act), Miyazaki's most light-hearted film is otherwise a fascinating, delightful, funny and charming fairy-tale that effortlessly teaches a variety of valuable lessons such as self-discovering, self-acceptance, self-reliance and self-understanding like no other film did.(8/10)",Kiki's Delivery Service
49,CountZero313,one of Miyazaki's best,9,26 April 2008,"Studio Ghibili's tale of a young witch undertaking a rite-of-passage journey to a town of mere mortals is an enchanting tale refreshingly free of heavy-handed morality or preaching. The simplicity of the story juxtaposes with the rich complexity of the animation, pacing and characterisation. The ersatz European setting is both familiar and other-worldly. The teasing and embarrassment associated with love's first blush is charmingly replicated. As for the blimp, it is a stunning visual, graceful but also menacing. There are no bad guys, evil crones, dragons, goblins or antagonists of any kind. And yet Miyazaki keeps the attention of audiences young and old through finely observed, episodic film-making.It is no wonder many claim this as Ghibili's best. For me, it doesn't eclipse Totoro, but it is a delightful animation that families will enjoy again and again.",Kiki's Delivery Service
50,Blue-Grotto,Rite of Passage for Young Woman,10,4 August 2019,"With the lights of a city full of indifferent and preoccupied people below, a young witch makes her way across the night sky on a broom with her cat. While Kiki has magical powers and is not a normal thirteen-year-old girl, she feels the same pangs of loneliness, isolation and disillusionment as anyone else. Kiki's path is a rite of passage that everyone makes, or should make, in their lives.Bathed in the light of the full moon, confident, smiling and stout of heart, Kiki begins her journey from home in good form. She finds a promising town by the ocean just as she hoped. What is unexpected is for people to be unkind to her. Kiki's powers wax and wane depending on her emotional state. The more listless and jaded she becomes, the more she risks being shunned and becoming a perpetual outsider. However, there are those who appreciate her charm and unique gifts and accept her for who she is. Through kindness, laughter, and looking inside herself for inspiration, Kiki blazes a path towards independence and serenity.The luminous light blue sea, colorful wildflowers, reflections in windows, the glow of streetlamps, shadows, fashionable clothes (for the 80s), the way the wind moves tree branches, moonlight and other realistic and fanciful details characteristic of Studio Ghibli are here. The impressive depth does not end with the quality of the animation. Fantastic revelations about human nature, compelling themes, delightful sounds of birds, crickets and wind, the supportive view of animals, artists and the natural world, the foreign intrigue and more, all add to the thrill of the film. Above all there is no superficial feeling about the film despite its fanciful nature. For all its lofty achievements it is down to earth and just plain enjoyable. Surprisingly Stockholm serves as artistic inspiration for the animators. Kiki's story is based on a children's book by Eiko Kadono.",Kiki's Delivery Service
51,Imdbidia,Simply adorable,8,13 February 2011,"Kiki's Delivery service is a Studio Ghibli's animation movie loosely based in the book of the same title by Eiko Kadono, but with important additions by Miyazaki.It tells the story of Kiki, a 13's y.o. witch who, as all witches at that age, leaves the nest on her broom with her talkative black cat Jiji to get a life of her own and start her training as a witch in a big city away from parents and friends.It is a Ghibli's trademark the detail and artistic drawing of the scenery and cityscapes, and Kiki's is no exception with a precious and colorful drawing. The European city where Kiki goes is a mix of Northern Europe style and Southern Europe lighting and summer mood. The time frame is an imprecise point in time, a golden-era of peace and tolerance, set around the 1950s, but with elements that go from the 30s (the zeppelin) to the 60s (B&W TV), with other elements that can be placed in between.Three elements stand out in this movie beyond the animation. The first one is Kiki's story - a metaphor of the changes that take us from childhood to adulthood, from being in the family womb and protected, taking what we have for granted, to being alone, unprotected, standing by ourselves, defining who we are and want to be as individuals.The second element is very Miyazaki's, i. e. the presence of magical and non-magical elements mixed to create a harmonic world of good-natured tolerant humans, so much so as to accept as natural a witch flying in their city and working in a delivery service.Thirdly, this is a movie about women, female nature and sisterhood. In fact, the main characters, except for Tombo -Kiki's admirer and good-natured inventive friend- are powerful savvy women: Osono, the pregnant baker, represents acceptance without questions, maternal care, the City, hard work and determination; Ursula, on the contrary, represents freedom and personal independence, follow your heart and explore your soul as a motto, Art and Nature, doubt; finally, the two old ladies in the blue-roofed house -Madam and Bertha- are examples of kindness, carefulness, attention to the detail, old manners and class. In fact, Kiki finds a mother, two grandmas and a big sister in the city. Miyazki's Europe is, it seems, a a matriarchal society.There a few points that I would have liked further explored, and I would have not mind some extra footage, as the movie is truly enjoyable and you finish it wanting more. I thought the end was a little be hurried up.A warning - Watch it in Japanese with subtitles if you can, as the American dubbing is dreadful, and ruins the movie. It is not really a dubbing, but an interpretation with additions to the original made by Disney; you see that the characters are not talking or making any noise, but there are voices coming from somewhere, the cat's voice is ridiculously turned into an adult sarcastic male, and another list of unforgivable changes. The same applies to the subtitles based on the American version, but not to the ones on the Japanese one. The Japanese original version is perfect as it is and does not need of any crap! And adorable story and characters. An entertaining and wonderful movie perfect for kids and adults.",Kiki's Delivery Service
52,mfellipecampos,Good,7,17 March 2021,"O Serviço de Entregas da Kiki (1989) fourth film produced by Studio Ghibli, based on the eponymous series by Eiko Kadono and under the direction of Hayao Miyazaki, chronicles the journey of the young witch Kiki and her kitten Jiji in the big city, where she serves of deliveries. The film portrays, in a light and humorous way, female emancipation through a young Japanese witch. Kiki's journey is due to a tradition of witches in which, when they turn 13, they have to travel alone. Thus, the little witch and her cat Jiji leave the family and choose the port city of Koriko as their new home. However, she is not welcomed in the most friendly way and ends up feeling lonely. About to give up on Koriko, she receives a welcome from Osono, a local baker. Osono is not the first woman in the plot to reach out to Kiki. Throughout her lonely journey in a strange place, other female characters appear and we perceive a beautiful atmosphere of sorority. Kiki, although very young - 13 years old !! -, is very independent, determined, bold and mature. These and other qualities are developed with each experience lived due to the deliveries. The character is exposed to dangers, mismatches and adventures that make her smarter in the face of life. The curious thing about the film is that, even though she has people close to her in her daily life, she deals with all adversities only. Perhaps it is a ploy by the author to make the heroine stronger and more striking. One point to be aware of is the director's sensitivity in showing the discoveries of youth life, from starting a friendship to discovering love. And a ""plus"", very recurrent in Ghibli studio productions, is Koriko's scenic setting: there is a mix of bucolic with modern that brings comfort and is an oasis in the eyes of the viewer. It is also worth mentioning that the plot is much more of a personal journey of self-knowledge and maturity than of witchcraft itself. Kiki's training in becoming an accomplished witch is in the background for much of the story. The film is for all audiences, but, certainly, the female audience will identify a lot with this fearless and charming little witch.Film seen on the 16th to the 17th of March 2021.",Kiki's Delivery Service
53,TalesfromTheCryptfan,A quality animated fantasy classic!,9,3 December 2017,"In the year 1960 in a European city that is not named in an alternate world where WWI and WWII never happened, a 13 year old witch named Kiki (voiced by Minami Takayama in the Japanese version and Kirsten Dunst in the US dub) has left her home to train for her special skills as it's a tradition that every witch who is 13 years old must go out on their own for special training even in magic skills. Kiki with her faithful talking pet cat Jiji (voiced by Rei Sakuma in the Japanese version and Phil Hartman in the US dub) take shelter in a bakery/house owned by a married couple who owns the bakery named Osono (voiced by Keido Toda in the Japanese version and Tress Macneille in the US dub) and Fuoko (voiced by Koichi Yamadera in the Japanese version and Brad Garret in the US dub) in the attic of their house. She decides to set up a high-flying delivery service in delivering stuff to people. She must do everything into become a full fledged witch and earn responsibility even gaining friendship to find her place in the world.A very entertaining, well written and dazzling 1989 animated fantasy-drama from famous Japanese animation filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki whom is one of the most gifted filmmakers/storytellers in animation, graphic novel and motion picture history. Based on a novel by Eiko Kandano, Miyazaki adapts the story for the big screen and was a box-office hit in it's native country in 1989 and earning critical acclaim. It came to the US in 1998 by Buena Vista Home Entertainment with the voices of Kirstein Dunst, Phil Hartman, Debbie Reynolds, Kath Soucie, Matthew Lawrence and Janeane Garofalo and was a success on the home video market in the US and one of the movies that made anime mainstream just like Akira, Ghost in the Shell, Ninja Scroll and more and was the third time a Miyazaki movie came to the US. First it was Nausicaa in a butchered cut called Warriors of the Wind in 1985 then Castle of Cogliostro by Streamline in 1991 then My Neighbor Totoro in 1993 by Troma/Fox.I first saw this in 98 when i was a teen and been one of my fave anime movies since and it's a delightful, funny, sweet and charming motion picture that appeals to both genders and all ages. I like how there's no villain or bad guy for this one which is quite refreshing for a Ghibli film with Totoro, it's a story about gaining independence and learning that friendship can be a nice thing. The animation is purely stunning in it's 2D glory and voice acting is very nice in the Japanese version, the dub is decent yet Matthew Lawrence as Tombo the boy who falls for Kiki sounds kind of older. Yet the dub is one of Phil Hartman's last roles before his untimely death, RIP poor Hartman but he did a nice voice performance as Jiji in the US version.Joe Hisahi's score is totally magnificent and has a charm to it even the feel of the movie is one of those feel good movies that makes you warm inside at the end and the characters are likable especially Tombo to Kiki.",Kiki's Delivery Service

""Charming"" is the word that comes to mind. Kiki's world is one of kindness, compassion and understanding, and watching her journey of independence and self-discovery is a joy. She's a lovable character. The film has a warmth to it that complements its gentle (but not sluggish) pace. I also adore her familiar, Jiji, whose stoic remarks never feel like jokey throw-away one-liners. Tombo is a bit irritating at first, and there's a few too many phony belly-laughs, but otherwise I find the whole thing enchanting.",Kiki's Delivery Service
57,MattBrady099,Hayao the master of Anime,9,13 February 2015,"Hayao Miyazaki is like the Steven Spielberg of animated directors.The story to Kiki's Delivery Service is about a young witch striking out on her own. At her mother's behest, 13-year-old Kiki sets out on a year-long apprenticeship with her black cat in tow. With a shaky command of her broom, she ends up in a charming little coastal town that looks like a cross between the French provincial and San Francisco. Unfortunately, the local hotels have a strict ""no witches"" policy and the police have taken a dim view of her recent aerial mischief-making. She's saved from the street by a kindly baker's wife, who offers her room and board in exchange for her delivering by broom the baker's wares.While I still haven't seen Hayao Miyazaki other films yet as I'm slowly checking one out time by time, but the ones that I did watch from him has already amazed me and there's something about his films that makes me feel good about myself and I can't wait to watch his other films because this is hands down one of the greatest animated director of our generation. This guy hasn't disappointed me yet and his films is for everyone even little kids, yeah they might like it by the pretty looking colors, but I think adults can also lock on to this film has well. Hayao Miyazaki always gives you everything you always dreamed off in a anime and that's why it leaves you feeling happy and full of imagination and that most other animated films lack on. Kiki's Delivery Service is another fantastic film by him the master of anime himself.The animation in this movie...now where do I even began with the animation. I've seen many animated films that blew my mind away with it's visually stunning effect's, but with this I think the animation in this movie and in Hayao movies do top other Hollywood animated films and it deserves to be viewed by everyone and not lifted in the shadow's. Have you every watched a Hayao Miyazaki film and got so sucked it only by the bright blue sky, there's always something about the blue skies in there's films that I could get lost in them (In a good way). The main character Kiki was such a likable and understandable character that I already understood her and get what she's coming from. Her pet sidekick the black cat was so adorable and funny as well.Now for the problems with the film: ...?Overall Kiki's Delivery Service ( or Majo no takkyûbin ) is a fantastically stunning film with beautiful animation. I'm not going to give it the perfect and that's because to me this isn't like a 4/4 movie, but it's still a damn good film.",Kiki's Delivery Service

These dynamics combined with Kiki's business blunders (Jiji's sacrifice was hilarious) and poignant personal growth (from ""something's wrong with me"" to the brave rescue to the letter home: ""there are still times when I feel sad"") make for a deceptively powerful coming-of-age tale.

Occumpanying her is her black cat Jiji; a very cynical, negative cat. Moving to a seaside town set in France, Kiki acquires a room in the attic of a Bakery. She works in the Bakery but she starts her own business; a delivery service. A love interest ensues with Tombo, a young boy who dreams of making his own flying machine. Love also comes for Jiji in the neighbours white cat.This is a beautiful story about coming of age, love, friendship and independence. Kiki is such a naive girl when she leaves home; but she is very head strong, also stubborn. But we all need to know that to ask for help isn't that hard, but pride is a very hard emotion to over come. The relationship between Kiki and Tombo is simple yet its so heart warming. Entering the dating world is very hard, and though Kiki wants to start a relationship with Tombo, she's to scared to take that step forward. But Tombo isn't going to give up easily.The french setting is so beautiful. All the setting are wonderfully drawn; as it is in all Studio Gibli movies. Hayao Miyazaki creates such a wonderful world inhabited by Kiki. This i feel would more suit people in their late teens, as they are about the age of leaving home and starting to make their own decisions in life. Its interesting that Miyazaki has made the lead so young in this situation.Though this may be seen as a kids movie, Hayao Miyazaki always creates a movie that anyone can enjoy and take something away from it.

61,TheHonestCritic,"When you watch this movie, you will find your heart soaring into the air!",10,8 June 2020,"""Kiki's Delivery Service"" (1989), this movie, tied with ""Spirited Away"" (2001), are the two best films made by Studio Ghibli. I know that most people will look at the title, and say: ""what? A movie about a delivery service? That sounds boring!"" To be honest, at first glance it does sound kind of dull. When I first watched this movie in elementary school, I thought the same thing! But, once the film got started, I found myself to be totally invested right from the beginning all the way to the end. This is a phenomenal animated movie! That just goes to show, don't ever judge a movie by it's title. You never know until you actually watch it and find out for yourself. In most cases, the simpler the story, the better. Simple plot lines allow more room for character development and your investment in the story is that much stronger. Once again, the voice acting from all of the actors and actresses is pitch perfect. I have seen both the original Japanese version and the English dubbed version. The Japanese version is great, but I prefer the English dubbed version. Kirsten Dunst is perfect for the voice of Kiki, and her performance just elevates the character to a whole new level. Phil Hartman (R.I.P.) as the voice of Jiji is fun, snarky and hilarious. All of the rest of the voice actors and actresses are just as flawless, but Kirsten Dunst and Phil Hartman steal the show for me. The soundtrack is different between the original Japanese version and the English dubbed version. Both versions are very nice, but I prefer the score from the English version. My personal favorite songs in the movie are, ""Soaring"" and ""I'm Gonna Fly"", which happen to both be performed by Sydney Forest. Every time I hear either of those songs outside of this film, I just get overwhelmed with warm feelings and nostalgia. Whenever I hear those songs, I just want to stop what I'm doing and watch this movie. That's the mark of a perfect soundtrack! However, on the DVD releases after 2010, John Lasseter of Pixar, who happens to be a friend of Hayao Miyazaki, got involved with remastering and editing the movie for the Blu-ray release. As a result, the soundtrack was changed and even the majority of Jiji's ad-libbed lines were removed. That's both sad and insulting to the character, and to Phil Hartman himself! I respect John Lasseter as a film maker, but I think he ruined ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" when he got his hands on it. If you're looking to watch this film, or buy it on DVD, make sure that the poster matches the one you see here on this screen. It is, by far, the superior version. John Lasseter, what in the world were you thinking?! Other than the drastic changes in the releases of this film after 2010, this is a totally flawless movie that fires on all cylinders! The original English dubbed version, that is. Not the new English dubbed release. This is a beautifully animated film, as are the rest from Studio Ghibli. I can watch it over and over again and never get tired of it. Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. Reminder, make sure you watch the original English dubbed version release from before 2010. Trust me, you'll love that one so much better. If you haven't seen ""Kiki's Delivery Service"", you're definitely missing out. Go watch it today, and your hearts will soar into uncharted heights of fun and imagination!",Kiki's Delivery Service
62,jose-cruz53,Flawless,10,8 October 2012,"First of all, one should watch this film in the original Japanese version. The American dub is terrible for two main reasons: 1- The lower quality of the voice acting fails to convey emotions effectively. 2 - It alters the dialogue to such an extent that the film can be said to be violated. They invented whole new phrases. Clearly, Disney did not respect this film as a work of art. So, watch it subtitled if you can, otherwise I would take two or three stars off this film, as it is seriously impaired in the Disney version.So, beginning the review of the film with the Japanese voice acting, despite its rather silly title (Kiki's Delivery Service), this film is much more than a kiddie film. Its basically a film about finding your way in life. That it is animated and has a 13 year old witch as its protagonist doesn't imply its dull witted like American animated films. Its a film for everybody, from ages 8 to 80 (though the younger kids will fail to understand if). This film has one of the most complex characters ever, Kiki. The film has no villains and no conflict, besides Kiki's own inner conflicts. Overall, I cannot find any flaws at all in this film and I give it a perfect score. Its truly one the best films ever made.In Japan it was the top grossing film of 1989 and it was the first of the many Ghibli films to become major blockbusters in Japan (currently, out of the 6 highest grossing films of all time in Japan, 4 are Ghibli films, the other 2 are Titanic and Avatar).This film is also breathtakingly beautiful and the fictional city in which Kiki's operates her delivery service possesses a mixture of architecture from many different regions of Europe. While the landscape of the countryside around it is inspirited in Sweden's.Also, one should never forget the high quality music provided by Hisaishi that reinforces the elegance of this film. I have even brought the soundtrack of this film, which I rarely do.",Kiki's Delivery Service
63,refresh_daemon,Charming and great for kids,8,9 September 2007,"Kiki's Delivery Service is not an epic like other Miyazaki films I've watched as of late, but has more in common with Totoro in that it's a smaller film about children. Kiki is a coming of age film about a young witch who leaves home for her year of training. The story is about her learning about independence.It's that simple. Kiki finds a town to train in and sets up a Delivery Service. She meets an interesting cast of characters and learns a lot about herself. The animation is gorgeous, as is typical of Studio Ghibli films. I especially like how Kiki's familiar, Jiji is rendered. The American dub is just fine, although very different in tone from the Japanese dub--but it contains a warm performance by the late Phil Hartman as Jiji the cat.What I really liked about the film was how realistically it portrayed little Kiki. She's not a perfectly upbeat character, but she suffers from confidence and loneliness issues as well as some homesickness, but can be surprisingly upbeat too. I really connected with her in how hard it is for her to connect to new people. Despite the moments of doubt and confusion, the film overall maintains a strong spirit of adventure and is a wonderful, positive and uplifting piece overall; I would say that it's a great film for young people.It's a little short and the story arc doesn't reach the highest highs, but I don't think it was intended to. The US DVD also has an intro by John Lasseter, much like other Ghibli releases. Personally, I would rather have him do a commentary track or a short bonus feature than affix his little intro to the front of the movie, but it's skippable.All in all, a wonderful and charming little film. Great for kids and possibly even fun for adults. 8/10.",Kiki's Delivery Service
64,Darkjak007,Magical coming of age,8,2 March 2021,"Kiki's delivery services is directed by Hayao Miyazaki, studio ghibli 4th movie. The film tells the story of a young Witch named Kiki Who just turned 13 and heads out into the world to find her place in life. Kiki herself is a lovable character with a peppy attitude with determination although she doesn't seem to be all there and doesn't seem to know how the human world works and is rather reckless at first. Kiki along the way meets plenty of friends along with her talking familiar cat Jiji. There's Osono a kind pregnant woman who own a the bakery that Kiki ends up working at. She meets others characters who helps her decide what she wants to do with her life. This isn't really a story about magic but more on life. So kiki isn't going around cursing people just meeting with others ,and reflecting on what they tell her while having fun along the way. The film biggest accomplishment is the scope of the landscapes majority of the film kiki is flying and you see large bird point of views of the entire city. From the center to the blue coast of the ocean, It gives you A calm sense of exactly where she is and how large is this city when she flies fast through the streetsor slowly over the city. The city itself is a beautiful piece of art, essentially is a collage of Italian,Swedish and Czech architecture, Accompanied by accordion music that's put you in the mind of Prague.

65,Bob Pr.,Delightful fantasy for kids and adults; score: 9.9,10,17 April 2000,"(English: ""Kiki's Delivery Service"")This film is in the Japanese ""Animé"" style (typically having serious themes presented at several different levels, kids through adults -- but look it up, e.g., on Wikipedia or www.about.com , for a more detailed explanation). My expectations were out of whack with what this movie actually provides. I expected oriental characters and towns but there were none -- characters were occidental and so were the landscapes and architecture, which resemble a Bavaria placed by the sea. The time was fluid without being jarring; some vehicles, appliances, people characteristics, etc., were drawn from the '30s through the '80s, so it became essentially timeless. And I was wondering about the ""witch"" aspect, but that's really much more a story-telling device, a rite of passage with hurdles, that presents some very human challenges.The artwork is quite handsome. The characters are all somewhat cartoon-ish but their actions in such small things as laughing, smiling, being puzzled, seem more realistic (perhaps intensified?) than is true of American animated films of this same ('89) era. Some of the other objects, e.g., ships, have similar simplifications while most of the landscapes, the backgrounds to the characters, are really quite beautifully portrayed. The story tells of a young girl's growth and maturing in getting to know herself through a series of challenges. Much of this has a ""slice of life"" quality to it. Utterly charming. While I've loved all the Miyazaki/Studio Ghibli animé films I've seen (Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle, Princess Monomoke), Kiki is my hands down favorite probably because it's so perceptively human and has less interventions of magic or spirits.A few IMDb reviewers comment on their preference for the Japanese version with sub-titles. We saw the dubbed American Disney videotape version and liked it (Phil Hartman's voice as Kiki's cat was great) but it's believable that a subtitled original could be even more fulfilling for an adult audience. As it was, this also easily kept a five year old's interest throughout -- plus her parents.",Kiki's Delivery Service
66,MrPupkin,A touching beautifully animated tale from the mind of Miyazaki.,9,24 October 2019,"Miyazaki is great at creating compelling characters but hiding some background information us nosy people from the west might be interested in. This happens with Kiki's Delivery Service, there are many things in the story we have no idea about. Those questions in our heads are quickly forgotten and pale in comparison to the great soundtrack, animation, beautiful landscape and just experiencing the day to day life of our main character. This is my go-to movie to introduce people to Studio Ghibli, as long as it's the original version subtitled and not the Disney edit that changes the soundtrack and ending of the film.",Kiki's Delivery Service
67,manendra-lodhi,Loved the message.,9,5 July 2012,"The film is again a treat for animation lovers. It is very nice in every sense. In the middle though I felt that everything is happening nicely and so it felt like monotonous. But I must say that the film delivers a very important message in the end, which is the essence of the whole film. The supporting characters are all very nicely inserted. What I liked the most in the film was the positive vibes all the time of viewing which makes an optimistic environment around you. And the character faces trouble also, but in such a way that you will never feel angered on any character. The antagonist type thing is not present in the film and that is an important reason why I felt nice during watching it. The film teaches you about hope and self-belief.""A must watch for everyone.""",Kiki's Delivery Service

A superb character study as well as a detailed examination of depression hidden inside a charming children's animation about a 13 year old witch! Yes its hard to believe...There are so many great scenes here and the animation is just perfect. Some may carp about the slight story or the action climax but for me this is studio Ghibli's best.

70,kurosawakira,City Symphony,9,26 June 2014,"A beautiful city symphony, ""Majo no takkyûbin"" (1989), or 'Kiki's Delivery Service', is a brilliant film. I had seen this, of course, perhaps some ten years ago, or even more, but there was very little I remembered of it and arrived at it rather late after going through most of Miyazaki's other works. Just before 'Kiki' I saw ""Gake no ue no Ponyo"" (2008), which is I find uncharacteristically not to my tastes at all. Similar to ""Tonari no Totoro"" (1988) only to some extent, there the whole universe, including the narrative logic and style of animation, seem so simplified and bland I thought it lost its flavour, devoid of the sly humour that's Miyazaki's through and through. But 'Kiki', then! In only five minutes Miyazaki has set up the universe, the house, Kiki as the main character and her family, and what a wonderful opening it is. It has all the familiar ingredients of friendship, entering a new world on one's own, overcoming one's own fears, some amazing flying plus that wonderful humour I already mentioned. But above all 'Kiki' is about what it's like to create art. There's the conversation in the cabin that, for me, is the centre of the film: overcoming one's greatest obstacles (one's own self and fear of failure) to evolve to a higher plane. The scene explicitly mentions painting, which explicitly refers to the art of animation, but isn't Kiki too an artist on her own right, playing to her strengths? I wouldn't have been surprised to see her in Jirô's dreams instead of Caproni in ""Kaze tachinu"" ('The Wind Rises', 2013), since she is, perhaps, the quintessential aviator in Miyazaki: someone who has known to do so from such an early she doesn't remember what it was like to fly for the first time, and does it by mere skill (or ""gut"", as I think she calls it in the film). To fly, to paint, to create, etc. is to believe in oneself.",Kiki's Delivery Service
71,nethy-nho,Not so magic but still adorable,8,13 June 2020,"Off course be a story about a witch you wait for more and more magic, but the movie treats this with naturalness, is just the young witch searching for your place, but is cool see your fears and evolution.",Kiki's Delivery Service

I remember buying the English version when it first came out on video in 1998. I brought it because it was anime and I liked Sailor Moon at the time. After I watched this movie I was very pleased with it. The movie has very good music, the animation is great, and the plot overall is good. My favorite part is when Kiki saves her friend at the end of the movie. I also like the part when Kiki and Gigi are looking for a city to live in at the beginning. The cities look so pretty at night when they are all lit up. I suggest everyone of all ages to see this movie and I give it 10/10 stars.",Kiki's Delivery Service

I own my own copy now and whenever I pop it into my VCR, it always puts me in a good mood.",Kiki's Delivery Service
74,toqtaqiya2,This adventure story manages to address life issues that adults still struggle with.,9,25 August 2010,"Kiki's Delivery Service is a charming film by director Hayao Miyazaki, one of his best really. Originally Sunao Katabuchi was supposed to direct. What we have here is a simple story of growing up. Kiki achieving young womanhood. She's beginning to live on her own and forming important relationships. Miyazaki makes this very interesting. How does he do it? I think it's because of the good-natured Kiki. She's one of the director's most realized heroines. My favorite part of the film is her journey to the beautiful city of Koriko. The elegant story is boosted by Miyazaki's trademark animation, in this case one of his best efforts. The city, and just about everything else, looks detailed and wonderful. Then there's the interesting characters. Not only do they behave like real people (real good people mostly), but they light up the screen with their presence. Most of this is thanks to Miyazaki's direction along with his designs. The score by Joe Hisaishi is upbeat, influenced by European music. It suits the film perfectly. While there are a few elements of fantasy in the film, it is always pleasant and educating. I highly recommend seeing the delightful Kiki's Delivery Service.",Kiki's Delivery Service
75,pritol,Heart warming coming of age tale...,8,13 August 2020,"Such a simple story, about a young witch coming of age and making a life for herself in a new place... but beautifully executed!Lovely soundtrack, with animation that really showcases a picturesque idyllic Mediterranean city on the sea. It toes the line between sentiment and humour really well, as the main character goes through her story arc finding out who she really is, and learning to believe in herself.As with all Studio Ghibli movies, very heart warming, and enjoyable from start to finish!",Kiki's Delivery Service
76,jordyntsmith,"Chill, But Not Overly Engaging",6,14 January 2021,"I'll preface this by saying I'm not overly into anime; however, there is something I find alluring about it.That said, this movie is fairly light and enjoyable. It doesn't ask much from the viewer except to relax and enjoy. However, it also doesn't give a whole lot either. I don't feel anything has been added to my life by watching it.On a practical note, the movie is certainly geared toward a younger audience; however, I am hesitant to put it before a younger audience with its premise being set on leaving home and striking it out on your own at the age of 13. Kiki is extremely fortunate in her encounters, far beyond what you would see in the real world.",Kiki's Delivery Service
77,e-67102-48412,A film full of hope,10,4 April 2020,"The story is very interesting in the way the witch exists in modern society. In addition to the flight instinct, other special skills have been degraded. For example, Kiki's ability to treat diseases is not intended to be passed on to Kiki, but to give way to modern medicine. Therefore, for the little witch, spiritual practice is more secular, mainly through independent life to strengthen her heart. When I didn't watch this movie, I thought about it in my own heart. There seems to be no wonderful story to interpret under such a setting, but the content of the film surprised me and the story is very rich.",Kiki's Delivery Service

Without seeing a single anime for a while, I put this piece on together with a friend of mine and we went into the digestion of something who later came out to be one of the best anime's I've ever seen. Kiki's delivery service is sort of a piece who consists of all things that I normally feel that only none-animated movies can come up with, and with mixing this feeling with the true anime vibe, it just went out perfect. An 8 out of 10 for me, and anything less is not an option. See this piece, and enjoy every minute of it as I did :-)Kiki forever :-)",Kiki's Delivery Service

81,jimvandemoter-50236,I love this movie.,10,25 June 2020,I first rented this movie on tape then I bought a copy of it. Now I have it on blu-ray and I still love it. I've watched it well over a dozen times and it still feels fresh. Miyazaki's attention to detail and nuance is almost perfect. It's so easy to watch just the action and miss all the fine details of each scene. There's a real feel of depth and texture to the street scenes and the expressions on the charactures faces. Don't just think it's just a film for young girls. Anyone of any age can enjoy it. This is one of Miyazaki's early films and I think it's still a masterpiece.,Kiki's Delivery Service
82,Lupercali,Ghibli is impressive as always,8,24 September 2004,"First of all, 10 points to Ghibli for Variety. Producing this and 'Grave of the Fireflies' inside a year of each other would be like Disney doing 'Mary Poppins' and 'Judgement at Nuremberg' back to back.Words that spring to mind after watching Kiki include 'delightful', 'light', 'bouyant', and so forth. It's obvious Miyazaki has refined his craft considerably from the early movies, which somehow seemed a bit... I don't know - stuttery. Kiki, though just flows effortlessly. Combine this with the beautiful use of lighting and colour to produce that summertime, Mediterranean sort of feel, and Kiki is a movie that is just thoroughly uplifting, never getting bogged down in complexities or dark intrigues.Unfortunately - and this is the only thing holding it back from 4 stars from me - what it does get slightly bogged down in, is its own lightness. There were just a few sections where the lack of a villain, of any real action, of anything other than people being nice to each other, took the top 10% off what was otherwise a masterful movie. I suppose there were a few other flaws, too: some characters and situations which came into it were just not developed at all. And there was one moment that teetered on real poignancy - the old dog with what he thought was a stuffed toy - but it sort of didn't happen. Also allowing the cat - sorry, forgotten his name - to drop out of proceedings for most of the latter half the film, definitely removed a spark from the film (I can't believe I just complained about the LACK of a comic sidekick)BTW, as someone who lives in Tasmania, which is allegedly the inspiration for much of the setting of this film, please come here by all means, but don't expect it to look like that. The bakery in Ross (central Tasmania) which supposedly inspired the one in the film is in one of the few Tasmanian towns that you _can't_ see the ocean from, and the general look of the movie is distinctly southern European, though I guess some of the rural shots look a bit Tasmanian. Whatever the case, Miyazaki's attention to detail is, as usual, stunning. The town may have been cobbled together from his favourite bits of Italy, France, Tasmania and wherever else, but its nothing less than a labour of love nonetheless.Anyway, 8 out of 10.",Kiki's Delivery Service
83,w-71474,I also want to be a free and happy witch,9,9 April 2020,"Even if he hits his head and starts to pack, he still has to fly freely.
I have seen a review of Hayao Miyazaki's film: Hayao Miyazaki made only one movie in his life, called our innocence and loss. The simple and simple life before the industrial age is gone, helpless and helpless in the face of social changes. When Kiki lost her magic, but saw the product of the technological era of the big aircraft flying in the air, the feeling of losing her sky was resonant.However, the results were all good. He made a compromise between reality and innocence, not just a compromise of quantity, but became more flexible. So, when I entered his movie, my heart gradually became quieter. When I was exposed to the contradictions and conflicts in it, there was a trace of sorrow. At the end, I found that my emotions were quite complicated. Animation. The understanding of life will never end, the day to adapt to new situations, and to find the life you want. Hayao Miyazaki said through the movie, if there is such a sky, even if it does not get the majority's approval, you must defend it.Growth is the result of those trivial things.
Even more memorable are the dogs and cats of childhood, the sunny days that accompanied us.
The witch's black cat is very vital and very cute.",Kiki's Delivery Service
84,sjarja,amazing,10,3 September 2016,"For me - it is a clear 10/10. It is one of those rare gems that contradicts so many usual movie concepts but emerges much better from this.This movie tells a part of a story of the life of Kiki. It is an exciting part - full of wonder and adventure ... but it is not some artificial adventure with epic good vs. evil... nor is it some rare and unlikely incident that puts the protagonist into unlikely positions she needs to solve with previously unknown skills.Instead it is the excitement of growing up and becoming independent. The situations Kiki gets in are situations that pretty much EVERYONE lived through at a certain age. There is not really much hyped up action (well, at least if you get down to it...) - and everything Kiki goes through remains relatable.The people - no matter of importance - act natural (well in the context of most Miyazaki movies) and it is one of those rare movies that gets along without an antagonist to drive the story forward.But at no time does the movie feel long or boring - and it also ends on a high note without sinking into stereotypes.In terms of art and design - it is as stunning as other Miyazaki films of that time. Amazing hand drawn animation with a vivid world and vibrant colours. Probably not as stunning as Spirited Away .. but on equal terms with Howl's Moving Castle.",Kiki's Delivery Service
85,HanShotFirstGR,"Adorable, important and just so warm!",8,22 January 2021,"Plot:A young witch, on her mandatory year of independent life, finds fitting into a new community difficult while she supports herself by running an air courier service.Analysis:During his amazing careear Hayao Miyazaki has given us many amazing animated films that are suitable for both kids and adults. Kiki's Delivery Service although it is more of a kids movie it keeps the theme of Ghibli Movies and it's a very good experience for grown-ups too. Compared to many other movies of the same studio, this one is probably less impressive for older ones but it still has this cute and unresistable feeling that all the others have, so it's probably another great option design by the genius of mr. Miyazaki.This movie follows a young little witch who travels far away from home, trying to get experience from the real worlds. Kiki is the adventurous girl who dreams to see an ocean and experience other cultures. She tries to find her place in a hostile world, very different from what she had imagined but not enough to make her give up the amazing journey she dreams about. This is a story that follows very important aspects of life, like socilizing problems, difficulties of independence and moving to a big city. Each issue has been treated with respect and incredible realism, making this movie so important and innovative for its times.Kiki's character is the only one that gets enough attention and to be fair the absense of development in secondary characters is kind of an issue in this film, but it doesn't affect the overall quality enough to make the experience less entertaining. Kiki is a dreamer, an optimistic, hard-working young lady with big dreams and the appropriate focus to achieve them, she goes through a journey where she questions her abilities, the possibility of success and the difficulties of life, she has to grow up, to evolve and to learn how to live with all of these things, a valuable lesson for everyone and such a wonderful way to present it through a story about a little witch and a delivery company.It's amazing how a fantasy world like that can give such a relatable story and a valuable message. Miyazaki's work has this unique way to combine incredible imaginary worlds with everyday problems and situations, making the stories both enjoyable and educational. This animated movie is the perfect one to give a child the feeling of real life, how hard but still beautiful it can be and also make you think about real issues like dreams, optimism and achieving goals. There is no doubt that Kiki's Delivery Service in a beautiful and very important film for animated cinema and an extremely good choice for everyone.Conclusion:It might not be Ghibli's best or most ambitious film, but it's the one who keeps the balance between the meanings perfectly, it doesn't have the perfect pacing and the visuals despite being pretty they aren't on the same level as other ones of their work, but it feels right and warms the heart of every viewer, it's a rare imperfect gem, that puts a smile in everyone's face and remains a beautiful memory in everyone's mind.Rating: 8.5/10",Kiki's Delivery Service

Aside from the lovely traditional hand drawn animation, charming settings and interesting characters, it is quite sad to say that this film disappoints and bores me. I do not how to justify this film, maybe too girlish if I could say and I do not enjoy this kind of simplistic story. If it's too girlish for me, well, it may be baffling for the boys.I do not like to criticise films as I believe each and every film made out there have their own unique selling point and charm to it as numerous efforts has been done and there's a lot of procedure prior completion of the film so hate to be frank; this film is sweet but not bewitching for a witch fantasy film. Yes, there are flying brooms, adorable talking cat and mentions of other witch abilities; I wasn't expecting much but honestly, there is way too little fantasy in it to be labelled as a fantasy film.Maybe you'll enjoy this if you love transition stories or broom-flying related stories and children may like this and learn something as it is sweet and good-natured.PS.

88,lee_a_scott,Funny but fluffy,6,11 September 2006,"To an extent I feel that you can almost say ""if you've seen one, you've seen 'em all"" about the films of Hayao Miyazaki, but when they all look lovely that is perhaps no bad thing. Having discovered Miyazaki backwards (starting with Spirited Away and unspooling from there), it is easy to spot the recurring themes and characters (Hey, is this the one where a young girl 'discovers' herself? It is? Great!) but it seems churlish to point this out. The films are fairy tales, and the plots, flimsy at best, are there to sell the parable and support the awesome animation that inevitably follows.I'd say Kiki's is a lesser Miyazaki, neither as visually dynamic as Spirited Away or Howl's Moving Castle, nor as cute and funny as My Neighbour Tortoro or The Cat Returns.

Making this kind of stuff is also not an easy task, as evidenced by the fact that so few decent kids' movies are made -- particularly ones that are entertaining, or at the very least painless, for adults to sit through. But Miyazaki's films are almost... spiritually enriching. They can actually improve the moral fiber of your offspring. And you probably need all the help with them you can get, lolz! (Nah, if you're showing your kids Kiki's Delivery Service, you're awwwwright. *wink* ) My little sister used to watch Kiki's Delivery Service when she was really young, and I never saw it but just the smile it put on her face.

It is a beautiful, if a little too idealized look at what the world (more Europe than Asia) could have been like if World War 2 and the events that led to it had never occurred--a world where airships still rule the air and the biggest problems in the world involve people being impolite to strangers.  But don't mistake that for naivity on the part of Miyazaki--anyone who's seen Mononoke Hime or read even one volume of Miyazaki's excellant Nausicaa comics can attest to his keen understanding of human nature.  And that is what can be seen in the character of Kiki, a young girl who really thinks and acts like a girl her age.  She is a surprisingly complex character, though perhaps this is displayed a little too subtly--Miyazaki's characters don't break into songs to reveal their inner feelings (a young witch Kiki meets tells her, ""I prefer to fly without accompaniment""), and often--like real people--refuse to explain or even see themselves as the audience might.",Kiki's Delivery Service

Though certainly not a feminist movie, KDS provides a positive (if old-fashioned) role model for young women. Unlike most American films, the movie shows a girl realizing her own power as a person not chanting feel-good slogans (""I am not a victim"" American Beauty) but through hard work and being herself.As part of her witch training, when Kiki turns thirteen she has to live away from home for a year. After some sweet (but not saccharine) scenes with the mother and father, Kiki flies off on her broom, careening off trees and bridges. She falls asleep in a train and finds herself near a town on the sea. Since there are no witches there, Kiki chooses the town. As it turns out, though, not everyone is fond of witches. Don't worry, this isn't Salem. They only do what Japanese tend to do with unwanted guests--they ignore her. After finding a foster home, Kiki decides to set up an air delivery service.For the most part, the movie is only thinly plotted (or heavily plotted, depending on your view). The main focus is on Kiki's emotions, although to Americans they may seem rather subdued because they are not underlined (this is a Japanese movie, after all). In one of the more overtly emotional scenes, she sheds a couple of tears because of a mixture of happy and sad emotions and then suddenly smiles. Kiki does get overly excited at times, just like most girls her age, and in the Japanese version she continually says ""taihen"" (""tough"" or ""difficult"") whenever she's running late or has trouble controlling her broom. Her less overt emotions are caught on closer inspection: watch for the bathroom scene, the ""oh my god I almost died"" scene, and the scene when she walks by a group of giggling girls.Also, keep an eye out for references to The Wizard of Oz.Kirstin Dunst as Kiki does a great job pretending that she's thirteen instead of about sixteen. And the sound technicians do a fantastic job varying the voice track so that it doesn't sound flat (I never knew what an important job sound technicians had until I watched the dubbed version of Ghost in the Shell and compared it to the original version).

It introduced me to arguably one of the greatest animators of all time, Hayao Miyazaki, who happens to be dubbed as the Walt Disney of Japan. Having since seen virtually ALL of his films, from THE CASTLE OF CAGLIOSTRO to SPIRITED AWAY (and eagerly awaiting HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE), I can see why he is such a highly acclaimed artist -- his works (and I mean every one of them) are a stroke of genius.KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE may have been my first real exposure to Miyazaki, but this happens to be the director's fifth film, which was the highest grossing movie of its year in Japan. Adapted from a children's book by Eiko Kadono (recently released in America), the film is not a typical good-versus-evil conflicted, dysfunctional story but a gentle, character-driven story with endearing characters, beautiful artistry, and a strong, positive message about confidence and independence that are quite encouraging for all, from the youngest of children to the oldest at heart. (On a side note, it persuaded me to get some exercise! The ""fat, fat, FAT!!!"" line did it for me.) The story is about 13-year old Kiki, an adorable witch-in-training, who, on one moonlit night, leaves her hometown to seek her independence and fortune. She's accompanied by her wisecracking and hilarious pet black cat, Jiji, and a little wobbly when it comes to takeoffs and landings while maneuvering her broomstick. Kiki arrives at a luxurious town with an ocean view where she eventually finds work at a bakery run by the generous Osono and her silent, gruff husband. There, she starts a high-flying delivery service which opens up many new relationships for the budding witch -- including a friendly painter, Ursula, a kind old woman, Madame, and a boy named Tombo, who dreams of flying.The above synopsis may sound dull, but KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE certainly is not. It is a joy to watch from start to finish as we see Kiki slowly grow up and learn to have faith in herself, especially when her powers begin to fade away toward the end of the movie. It's engrossing enough to keep one's attention and there are a number of tear-jerking moments that make it more than just a movie. This is a characteristic you'll only be able to find in Miyazaki, and KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE ""delivers"" a wonderful movie which shows that movies don't have to be about overcoming evil or action-packed or angst-ridden to be entertaining.The movie was originally dubbed into English by Carl Macek of Streamline Pictures. I have not seen that version, but this Disney dub features an all-star cast who do a truly excellent job with their roles. Thirteen-year-old Kirsten Dunst is perfect as Kiki, eliciting just the right touch of cuteness, spunkiness, independence, and poignancy to her role. The other actors, which include Debbie Reynolds (Madame), Tress MacNeille - of Tiny Toons and Animaniacs fame - (Osono), Jeanane Garofolo (Ursula), and Matthew Lawrence (Tombo), give similarly superb performances. Of the actors, however, it is the late Phil Hartman's witty, sarcastic take on Jiji that steals the show. I understand that some folks were offended at Hartman's performance and added-in lines, but if you have no such issues, then this is only extra icing on the cake -- especially when he does it so well. I swear, I just cannot get enough laughs every time I hear his lines. ""First, don't panic! Second, don't panic! And third, did I mention not to panic?!?"" The opening and ending songs were replaced by two gorgeous, rollicking numbers from Sydney Forest, but even they seem to suit the story wonderfully. In fact, I find myself bouncing to them every time they pop up over the opening and closing credits of the show. For you purists, the Japanese language track features the original songs (though there is a continuous debate about the subtitles being inaccurate, that's a very minor complaint) and credit presentation.All in all, KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE is a gem that should not be missed and deserves to be well-known in America as it is in Japan. I highly -- and I do mean VERY HIGHLY -- recommend it.",Kiki's Delivery Service
95,Jsimpson5,A true Japanese classic,9,31 December 2007,"I'm a huge animation fan. Mostly Anime, as I tend to be turned off by the stuff that is made in the USA with the exception of some animated TV shows like King of the Hill, The Simpson, and Family guy just to name a few. Over the course of the year I have been given the honor of watching some great anime films to come from Japan. This review will be able one of them.This story is basically about a teenage age witch named Kiki who must live on her own in another town for a year. Her mother is a witch but is not at good at witch craft as her mother is. When she gets to this town that she lives in, she does not know what she needs to do in order to make money.I won't spoil the rest of it for you as you will need to watch the film to see what she does to get by.The script is well written (I've only listed to the Japanese track and not the English dub track) and the animation is really good and had aged very well.If you enjoy anime films then you will enjoy this on multiple levels.",Kiki's Delivery Service

97,Alan-40,Lighthearted flying,7,10 January 2006,"Perhaps the most interesting thing about Miyazaki's movies is their ability to effortlessly mix cultures and time in order to create a setting for a story that feels right no matter how unlikely it is. Here we have a mythical country that has airplanes, cars, and television, but still accepts magic in the form of girls flying around on brooms with their cats, and out-houses over indoor plumbing.Reportedly, this is a un-named town in a Europe where the first World War never happened. Although the town hasn't seen a witch in a long time, they know what she is.It seems to be a very gentle place. I can't imagine many families that would allow their thirteen year old daughters to suddenly leave home to make it on their own in the big city. Although she can fly and converse with her familiar, her only other power seems to be an unquenchable naivete. Yet even though she is obviously unprepared, she makes it without too much trouble with the help of a friendly bakery owner and her husband.So Kiki comes of age, and we have fun watching. What's wrong with that?",Kiki's Delivery Service

99,SebMoz,"Not much to say, it's just adorable",9,26 December 2020,"Kiki's Delivery Service doesn't have the same sense of depth and symbolic meaning that other movies from Studio Ghibli has. It doesn't have the richest characters, the best worldbuilding, nor the most epic story. So, with that being said: I absolutely love this movie. Who cares if the story isn't grand when the story we do get is so heartwarming and enjoyable to watch. I love seeing Kiki find her place in the big city, I love seeing her relationsships with other people bloom, I love that almost every character in the movie is nice, kind and full of life. It creates such a nice atmosphere, and while a serious tone is necessary for some films, I'm glad this movie focuses more on the small things. There are no big monsters or deadly event that Kiki has to overcome, there is just a big city with all types of inhabitants, and almost everyone contributes to what might just be the cutest and most heartwarming animated movie of all time. The animation is gorgeous as usual, and the score is simple yet nice to listen to. The movie is well paced, well written and well animated, it's just the complete package. I don't consider it a true cinematic masterpiece on the same level as Princess Mononoke or Spirited Away, but it's almost just as enjoyable in its own right. It's a wonderful distraction from life's inequity and hardships, and I will cherish it for a long, long time.",Kiki's Delivery Service
100,tendobear,Finally!,8,11 December 2012,"Finally! A Studio Ghibli movie that doesn't suck! Although the movie was pretty good, it still wasn't perfect. However, I'm going try to focus on the positives this time. The characters were cute without being annoying - young male characters: not a mopey, melancholic, effeminate Emo in sight, the young female character is genuinely cute and not annoying. However, I think the black cat Jiji is the best: full of sass and most importantly, a sense of humour. One of my problems with Ghibli movies is that they have too many unnecessary characters, like they're over-indulgent on their own imagination and creativity. None of the characters in Kiki's are excessive. The story itself is simple and straightforward (hallelujah!!!), I'm so glad the story is lean and relevant.",Kiki's Delivery Service
101,rorymacveigh,A Children's film the whole family can enjoy!,10,6 August 2012,"Another simply magnificent film from Studio Ghibli which again truly enchants its audiences with its marvellous animation and brilliant characters as well as a story that everyone can enjoy.The basic story is a young Witch named Kiki has to leave home for a year as part of her training to become a fully prepared witch. A child of innocence, Kiki is unaware of what the world is like outside of her small coastal town and so she has little idea of what lies ahead. Flying out with her cat Jiji, the pair are caught in a storm and stow aboard a freight train which takes them to a magnificent coastal city. Almost immediately her presence draws some mixed reviews and after nearly causing a traffic accident with her haphazard flying, she is rescued from getting a ticket by a young boy named Tombo who is fascinated by her ability to fly and wants to get to know her. Slightly embarrassed and standing on tradition, Kiki is reluctant to know the boy that well and tries to ignore each confrontation they have. As part of her training, she needs to find a job to sustain herself, but after helping deliver a pacifier back to a mother who had forgotten it in a bakery, the bakery owner named Osono agrees to take her in and let her stay in their spare bedroom whilst Kiki carries out a delivery service for them with the help of her magic broomstick. Throughout the rest of the film, Kiki faces several trials on her innocent upbringing but also faces the strange feeling to the uninitiated known as love as her and Tombo slowly become more acquainted as time goes by.There are no words to describe the beauty of this film, it is just a fantastic piece of work. From the animation skills and craftsmanship involved, to the voice acting and storyline, this film is a recommendation for both parents and children!",Kiki's Delivery Service
102,StudentDriver,Beautiful film; Disney version pretty good.,10,9 September 1999,"This may seem a rehash of the previous comments, but I only now got to see the Disney dubbed release.I owned a bootleg copy of Kiki while it was still in Japanese theaters; I fell in love with the movie after first seeing the spectacle of the dirigible crash near the tail end. I learned to worship this movie because of the grandeur, because of the simplicity...I lost my bootleg copy, and after the American release, began hunting down the laserdisc. A year of searching, I finally found it... was it worth the wait? Yes, with reservations...I am (overly) familiar with the Japanese version, and did not want to be burdened with the ""star"" American voices; my wife doesn't like foreign-language film, though, so I needed the English version. With the LD, I got both benefits without having to purchase 2 VHS versions, and got to do some interesting side-by-side comparisons- switching between languages, watching the Japanese language version with the sub-titles for the English version, etc.First off- this *is* Miyazaki, and *this* is animation. It is utterly beautiful, and the story is a wonderful one for both children and adults. There are very few people who will not be charmed by this... except maybe teenage boys, who don't want to be caught liking something so sweet. Otherwise, I can safely recommend any version to anybody.Miyazaki films often prefer to paint a scene with pictures and music, not words. The English translation is an egregious offender here; what in the Japanese version are vignettes and scenes that are wordless become in the English version open chances for Phil Hartman and Kirsten Dunst to wisecrack, chat, or what-have-you. I feel that this is due to Disney's belief that children in America must be entertained for every second of a movie, lest their minds wander off.Just as many people find Japanese dialogue to be grating on the ears, so do I find the English language voice actors to be grating. Actually, mainly just (the late) Phil Hartman. His nasal, loud voice just does not fit JiJi, a cute, diminutive cat. Kirsten does an okay job, although her voice sounds a wee bit older than Kiki's 13.Already being familiar with the film, I have to admit being disappointed with the English version... it's a necessary evil, and I'm glad that my wife can enjoy the film now; but I feel that no matter how well-intentioned, Miyazaki's vision was dimmed somewhat in the Americanization. If the only version to come out had been an English version, I honestly would have rather imported a copy from Japan than support Disney.All that being said, though, I would place the English-language Kiki far above most Disney efforts, and especially above Disney's modern efforts. I sincerely recommend that everyone watch Kiki once; if you like it, try the Japanese-language version (Buena Vista has released a VHS, widescreen, sub-titled Japanese version. Thank you, Disney!) And if you are a Disney film fan, you owe it to yourself to see what the Japanese can do.",Kiki's Delivery Service
103,kriitikko,Warm and delightful film for young and old,9,6 September 2008,"Hayao Miyazaki is a surprising bloke. Just when you think you know what to expect from him, he pulls the carpet right under your feet. After ""My Neighbour Totoro"" you'd think that Miyazaki possibly could not make another as delightful animation that is suitable for all ages, and you know what he did? Another delightful animation for all ages! Man deserves to be saluted.""Kiki's Delivery Service"" (Majo no takkyûbin, 1989) is adaptation of Eiko Kadono's book. Like almost all Miyazaki's movies, the story is set in a world that may look much like the real world, but is not. This time the film would seem to be placed in the 1950's Europe, except the existence of witches and magic is taken as granted and neither of the World Wars ever happened. The protagonist Kiki is a thirteen years old witch who must, as all young witches must, leave her home for one year and live in another town on her own. Her mother is worried, for Kiki doesn't posses any other kind of magical abilities than flying on a broom. This doesn't put young girl down, who is filled with enthusiasm. Along with her talking black cat Jiji, Kiki moves to a town by the sea, where she then tries to fit in a community. Along the way she meets various different people, like baker woman Osono and her quiet husband, young artist woman Ursula and Tombo, inventor boy to whom flying is almost an obsession.Though ""Kiki"" has more plot than ""Totoro"" has, they are both the most delightful films Miyazaki has made for all families to watch. I don't know how he has manages to capture such a good feeling to these animations, but I for one am brightened up by ""Kiki"" and I didn't see this movie till I was 17-18 year old. The town where Kiki settles in looks very European, and was most probably inspired by Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, along with other European cities. The animators have done a grand job with it, and I personally wouldn't mind living there. Miyazaki has gotten a good excuse once again to bring his fascination with flying to the film, through both Kiki's broom flying and Tombo's obsession of aircrafts. And music is, of course, done by the always amazing Joe Hisaishi who certainly doesn't let us down this time either.I've never heard neither the original nor new Disney English dubs, so I honestly can't compare them to each others or Japanese audio. The original Japanese is done of course with perfection in mind and the film features not one but two just-starting-their-career-famous-voice-actors. Minami Takayama (Nabiki in ""Ranma ½"", Dilandau in ""Vision of Escaflowne"" and Conan Edogawa in ""Detective Conan"") voices both Kiki and Ursula, and especially as the protagonist her voice is so perfect for the part, I honestly can't imagine how Kirsten Dunst could top that. As the inventor boy Tombo, we hear Kappei Yamaguchi, famous for his roles as Ranma in ""Ranma ½"", Shinichi Kudo in ""Detective Conan"", title character in ""Inuyasha"" and L in ""Death Note"". Rei Sakuma also deserves to be mentioned for voicing Kiki's companion Jiji.I've heard that especially young women have found liking to this movie. This is probably due to the fact that movie does, subtly, tell about young girls difficulties to find her own place and how hard it is for her to keep her faith in herself. Whenever Kiki starts to doubt herself, it shows as a lack of ability to fly anymore. I'm sure many people, women and men alike, can relate to this problem and therefore feel sympathy for the character.Do I need to say it? Miyazaki did it again with this film and if people back in 1989 started to think he can't improve from this, he proved them wrong.",Kiki's Delivery Service

Although I love all of Miyazaki's feature films from the 1980s ( except the somewhat tame ""My neighbor Totoro"" ), I have been really surprised at how good this one is. Maybe the fascination lies in the flying sequences which look so real and three dimensional ( For example, when Kiki flies on her broom and accidentally hits a tree or when she simply lands on a street full of surprised people ) or in the symbolic story about growing up ( the part where Kiki one day suddenly looses her ability to talk to the cat is one of the most subtle metaphors for adolescence in cinema ).

So far all Ghiblis movies I watched are just so great I'm unable to put them in ranks. Kiki is just as amazing. Now why in the world I can't feel this same sensation when I'm watching Disney, Pixar movies etc etc...somewhere along the line that touch of innocence is lost. I enjoyed Monster Inc etc and find something to be childish but in Kiki,gee, that's being a child...and suddenly I'm there. Back to the days when I watched Snow White, Jungle Book, etc for the first time. I can't describe in word how it's like to have those feelings back.

I cannot recall the last time I saw a face full with struggle & determination as in Kiki's attempt to fly with the deck broom as her eyes start filling with tears.

109,Teebs2,Another charming Miyazaki film.,8,15 February 2006,"It does seem Studio Ghibli, like Pixar in America, can do no wrong with their animated features. ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" is a charming film which will win over all but the most cynical of viewer. Kiki is a young witch who has to leave home for a year of real-life experience. She chooses a beautiful city on the coast and sets up a delivery service, attracting the attention of various locals.To be fair, like many Miyazaki films the story is not really important. Other than the stunning visual detail, his films are most often centred around character rather than plot. I think the strongest aspect of all of Miyazaki's films is the way he mixes the fantastic with a very strong and realistic sense of place and characters with very human complexity. Kiki could have been left simply as a cute bubbly, optimistic character, and probably would have been in an American animated film. However, Kiki has moments of near depression as she struggles to deal with the attention of the infatuated young boy, Tombo. She struggles with her anti-social tendencies when confronted with new social situations. These very human weaknesses create a very sympathetic and rounded character , which can only enhance the film. Of course the film is enjoyable at a simple plot level, although the ending does seem a touch abrupt. I would say that the US voice dub is weaker than usual, Kirsten Dunst being a little annoying as the voice of Kiki though Phil Hartman near steals the show as her black cat Jiji.A fine film which will keep kids amused, but is equally rewarding for older fans of animation and Studio Ghibli anime.",Kiki's Delivery Service
110,oneofthesilence,Very nice film,9,27 June 2020,"While it's not the absolute best that Ghibli has to offer, I still very much enjoyed it.I quite liked Kiki herself. Very likeable and super relatable. Not to me specifically, but in a very general sense. She's an interesting representation of what burn out and less severe depression can look like.The plot is kinda loose and a little confusing at times, but it was still very engaging and well paced. The side characters were all pretty good as well. Most notably that outdoorsy painter girl. I liked her a lot. I also really liked Kiki's caretakers and that one kid who has a crush on her. They're all great.The animation was beautiful and so was the music when it was there. But that leads into one of my problems with the film. I felt that there were certain scenes with no music that really would have been improved if some was added. Some scenes were just uncomfortably quiet.Also, certain performances in the english dub were less than stellar... I really just mean the cat. He was not great. But I guess that's my fault for not watching it in it's original Japanese form. The voice actor for Kiki did really well though. So that's good.My last problem with the film is that the climax with the big blimp crash felt kinda forced and unnecessary. Very out of nowhere.But overall, Kiki's Delivery Service is a very engaging, fun, and beautiful film. It isn't exactly emotional, but by the end of the film I was super emotionally invested in Kiki's character and her struggles. Like there's no big emotional moment in this movie. There's just this very subtle level of emotional potency all throughout. This is a great movie.",Kiki's Delivery Service

The brilliance about this film, as with most films from this studio, is the subtle excellence that permeates the film like sweat on a cow. Like toes on feet being more defined than a typical Disney wedge, or knuckles on fingers, or individual spokes on bicycle tires, or feathers on crows, or even foreground blades of grass and straw. All of this humbling detail without ever distracting from the story at hand. Further, I deeply respect this film's ability to be at it's most powerful when also being most quiet. A girl's slow progress along the side of a curved coastal road becomes an encapsulated Homer's Odyssey, the heroes journey against all odds. Sure, the 10 year olds watching this with me were bored stiff through the first half, ""this is no Samurai Jack"" they decreed. Sure, they're right, that is a completely different kind of masterpiece. Still, to my older, supposedly more refined pallet, this is one of the finest things I've seen in a long time, and then I have to wonder, what took me so darn long to watch it?

And now once again I have to marvel at another Ghibli movie, one made 30+ years ago, that features an independent girl's personal journey, without getting overly distracted with a needless romantic subplot.
This is a more laid back film, and Kiki isn't a warrior like Nausicaä , though she is a fighter with her own share of struggles that make you root for her to succeed.
She is also selfless and brave, with a kind heart and an infectious passion for life that inspires joy in those around her.
If I had a daughter, or a son for that matter, they would be raised on studio Ghibli films, because as I explore Miyazaki's collection of movies I keep finding admirable role models for girls and boys alike, coming out of an era when Disney was mass-marketing nothing but hapless princesses in need of rescue.

There are discussions in Sweden right now (march 2002) to give her the Nobel prize in litterature for her stories even though she left this plane of existence a couple of months ago, that should say something about the quality of her stories.Now, this movie keeps the same quality! I never thought I would recognize the same warm feelings in a japanese animation since I mostly associate it with junkfood anime like Akira, Ghost In The Shell, Sin and Princess Mononoke (junkfood anime = anime that seems to fit into the minds of western teenage boys and are therefore translated into american english).

118,dballred,Another Miyazaki Masterpiece,9,4 November 2002,"By the time the title credits and music have concluded, Hayao Miyazaki has gently transported you into an alternate reality where witches and nearly a century of this-worldly anachronisms coexist. In this alternate reality, witches are productive members of society and use their magical skills in a variety of enterprises. They are neither evil nor feared. In order to hone their crafts, witches need to spend a year of internship away from their families when they reach the age of thirteen.Kiki, the central character of the story, has just turned thirteen and sets out with her black cat, Jiji, to find a place to live. We find out pretty quickly that she doesn't really have any magical skills other than flying, and even at that she's not very good.With this preliminary out of the way, the rest of the story is a fascinating account of a person learning how to fit in to a bewilderingly new environment. Any kid who has ever had to change schools or neighborhoods, any fresh graduate who has had to enter the workforce, or any experienced worker who has had to change jobs can empathize with what Kiki was going through.Even though the setting resembles something European, the characters are clearly Japanese in their general demeanor.  This causes a serious problem for those who rely on dubbed versions, as normal Japanese  conversation will sound sickeningly saccharine when translated into English.  If ever there was a case for watching the Japanese language version with subtitles, this is it.  I give this a 9 out of 10 rating.",Kiki's Delivery Service

Although I admire Hayao Miyazaki and his beautiful BEAUTIFUL animation technique and his resilience and his ability to continue spitting out these great animation and fresh stories, this one was just another alright cartoon. Kiki and Jiji are a cool duo. They can be funny, and I could sense the jokes when they were told, but they weren't funny, so I didn't laugh. They were cute and fun to watch, I enjoyed Kiki's personality more than I did that of Chihiro of ""Spirited Away"". Kiki develops, but there is no reason to it. She just... changes, and I don't see why. Her character makes new decisions or tries something different but I saw no reasoning behind it. Maybe (again) I am that close-minded-American and I couldn't see the cute and cuddly kiddy decision on why she was making these decision. And I would understand if she made these decision out of pure fun or ""because she was a kid"" but she kind of just, did. 1989, this is a great, this is a great achievement for 1989 technology in animation. But... I'm not insulting Mr. Miyazaki, I am pointing out a talent yet also a fault. But this movie has so many production similarities to ""Spirited Away"" and ""Ponyo"" that all I can see is... the same, no improvements. I didn't see improvements or progress, it's the same faces and same animation as his other films, just with a different story or plot.I don't really know what else to say about this movie, it was alright.SilverRating: 6/10",Kiki's Delivery Service

I began watching it last night at 22:20 and as I was pretty sleepy, the first thing I told to myself was: ""O.K., 'Tonari no Totoro' was pretty but without much of an interesting plot. I'll look the first half hour of this other Miyazaki movie and that will be enough..."".Enough? I found myself at 12:05 watching the end credits and listening to the music with a smile on my face! This movie is incredible and it will (this will do, believe me) make you feel like the kid you were once, with those all expectations of beautiness and goodness fulfilled in a city that exists in the exact moment where technology should have stopped... but where there exist also good witches!I know all I said could look a little bit stupid or candid but, hey, wait, you've got to watch it. Believe me: ""Majo no takkyubin"" is outstanding. As everything in life, it's not perfect, but it reflects that Miyazaki style very well, so as you can imagine the drawings are incredible and the story is (this one it is!) great.(Ah, and I am Tombo.

121,Queen_of_Shadows,Another amazing masterpiece with a good message,10,20 December 2005,"I remember everyday as a little girl that I'd put this movie in the VCR and watch it for as many times as I could remember.Finally,I get it on DVD (loosing the video) and see the Japanese version and like it twice as much.It is almost completely opposite from the English version and I see why people hate the Eng version so much.Personally,I prefer them both only because the Eng version has been apart of my childhood.Imagine a world where World War 2 never happened and witches exist. That's Kiki's world.Kiki,a strong-willed,independent and optimistic young 13-year-old girl is finally ready to depart from home and live on her own for a whole year in a new town to begin her training. For a witch,it is a custom for a young witch to live on their own for a year in another town to begin their training and possibly find their special skill.It sounds scary right?Well,it isn't for the brave and carefree Kiki.She leaves with her father's radio,a traveling bag and her best friend Gigi,a cat who she has the unique ability to talk to as she would with any other human.With all of her stuff,she travels on her mother's broomstick,flying through the air and searching for a new home.She finally finds a huge yet beautiful city,the kind of place she's always dreamed of living in.Overjoyed by the fact that there are no witches currently living in the city,she at first feels awkward in this new environment.Things look up though when she finally settles in and starts her own Delivery Service. However,living in a new place is a lot of pressure on a young girl. Not only does she deal with the pressure of her business but she deals with the pressure of fitting in.Suddenly,Kiki becomes conscious about what she wears and feels like an outsider when she's surrounded by certain people.Not only that but her special flying abilities begin to weaken without any warning. Can Kiki find her own inner strength to overcome her problems? Watch this spellbinding movie.Yes,there are witches in this movie but they are not the stereotypes of a witch.They do not have green-skin or warts,they don't crave power and aside from flying on broomsticks and communication with their cats,there is no special magic and such.It is just a simple story about a young girl fitting in.I said that there is a message in this movie and there is.It's that no matter how many terrible things happen,the key to surviving any problem is finding your inner strength and believing in yourself.Any young child dreams of flying like Kiki and at the beginning,she can fly just by thinking it like other kids can but later on,she goes through some kind of ""witch puberty"" when her flying weakens.She can no longer just escape from her problems with her flying,she sees that reality is tough and believing that you can do anything is the key to discover how to fly again and overcome her fears of living without her friends and family.I cried during this film out of a little sorrow but mostly out of joy.This is a film greatly recommended for the whole family.8/10.",Kiki's Delivery Service
122,panicwatcher,The greatest movie ever made,10,13 April 2001,"Kiki's Delivery Service is my favorite move.  I have seen it at least 10 times and I laughed and cried each time. The animation by Hayao Miyazaki is wonderful, as always.  The flying scenes and scenery of the generic European city are totally convincing.   I think I really got a feeling of what it would be like to fly in on a broom over and through a European city.   In each city scene, I feel like it is some place I have visited in my trips to Europe.What I really appreciate about this movie is the simplicity of the characters and the plot.  There are no robots, no psychotic megalomaniacs, no monsters, no superheros, no bratty smarty kids that are smarter than adults, no evil moron adults, and no fight scenes.   No one is kidnapped or seriously injured.  Even though the movie a about a witch, the only supernatural acts in the movie are Kiki flying on a broom and talking to her cat.The movie is about a young girl witch who leaves home with her cat Jiji, moves to a new town, and starts a delivery service.  In her business she has some adventures and meets mostly nice people who help her out.  In the process she meets a boy named Tombo.   Tombo does not have any special powers.  He is just a nerdy guy who is trying to build a bicycle that can fly.  Tombo gets in to some trouble and Kiki helps him out.That sounds very dull, but by avoiding the supernatural and monsters, the story is much more easy to relate to.  It is a story about leaving home and starting anew, meeting people, helping people, and have people help you when you get into trouble.   It is very upbeat, even when things look bleak, they work out with a little help from friends. I liked Tombo's problems trying to be friends with Kiki because they seem like the problems people really have.  One of the most beautiful scenes in the movie is Tombo silently waiting in the rain for Kiki who never shows up.This movie is full of silent beauty.   When the baker's wife invites Kiki to move in above the bakery, you get the impression that the gruff but silent husband does not care for Kiki.  But in a later scene you see that he has baked a loaf of bread shaped like a girl riding a broom and mounted it in the bakery window.  Nothing is ever said about it, but you see how he appreciates her.I have both the dubbed and subtitled version of the movie.   They are both great.  This movie is one of the best dubbed I have seen.   The dubbed version has a lighter, funnier tone because of the wise-cracking Jiji.   I felt I could appreciate the animation better in the dubbed version because I did not have to focus on reading the subtitles.  In general the voice acting in the dubbed version is excellent.    The subtitled version is also the letterbox version, so you get to see the full beauty of the animation.   In some of the flying scenes, Jiji is humorously complaining about the flying conditions in the dubbed version, where the subtitled version lets you silently appreciate the beauty of flying.   Due to licensing problems the dubbed and subtitled versions have different theme songs.  I think both songs are great.    I recommend getting both versions.",Kiki's Delivery Service
123,WondrousMoose,"Kiki's Delivery Service is charming, imaginative, and brimming with personality.",8,13 August 2017,"Over the past few months, I've been catching up on Studio Ghibli's legendary catalog of anime films. For almost 30 years, they released some of the most highly acclaimed animation and with incredible consistency. They co-produced last year's The Red Turtle, and I've heard rumors that they will be coming back from their hiatus in the near future. Until then, though, I have plenty more to catch up on; my most recent experience has been with one that I have heard a whole lot about – 1989's Kiki's Delivery Service.In this film, a young witch named Kiki (Takayama/Dunst) has just turned 13, the traditional age for her to leave her family and train her magic on her own. With her black cat Jiji (Sakuma/Hartman) at her side, she sets off and ends up in a large coastal city. There, she finds work at a local baker, befriends a lively artist, and catches the attention of an energetic boy named Tombo (Yamaguchi/Lawrence). As she struggles to find her purpose, she has to learn to make something of herself in a place that doesn't seem to have much use for witches.This has got to be one of the most charming movies that I've seen in a while. Through the combination of story, music, and Kiki herself, director Hayao Miyazaki creates a tone similar to that of his childlike masterpiece My Neighbor Totoro. We see Kiki's enthusiastic personality take her from place to place, and through the score and some good visuals, we feel every bit of this with her. Kiki proves once again that Miyazaki is an absolute master of character.One aspect that I respect about this movie is that to show us Kiki's life and personal growth, it doesn't follow a standard plot structure and instead tells its story emotionally. We follow Kiki in her everyday life as she responds to different situations and learns more about herself and the world around her. I described the plot of the film in just a few sentences above; I honestly wouldn't have much more to say in terms of particular moments, but that is part of the magic of this movie. Kiki's Delivery Service is a story about Kiki herself, and the fact that the film doesn't send her along common plot points keeps the focus entirely on her.The movie is also grounded, given its mystical elements. It takes place in essentially our world, only people are used to the existence of witches – some are fascinated, and some don't care at all. In one scene, Kiki lands on a street corner and enthusiastically shares her goals to the few people standing there, who then continue with their day as usual. You are given a real sense of the size of the city and how little Kiki seems capable of at her age, despite her high ambitions.At its core, this is a very down-to-earth movie about a teenage girl figuring out her place in the world and struggling with her conflicting desires of comfort and independence. At 13 years old, she wants to do so much, but she often finds herself inhibited by other kids, by her emotions, and by the environment surrounding her.Long-time Miyazaki collaborator Joe Hisaishi wrote the score for Kiki, and this is in my opinion one of his best. Each piece uniquely contributes to the character of the film and provides an emotional backbone without smothering or controlling the viewer's experience. His scores are often . I recommend listening to ""A Town With An Ocean View"" online to get a sense of not only the score but for the tone of the film as a whole.Overall, Kiki's Delivery Service is a wonderful coming-of-age story about a girl finding herself in a strange place. This movie probably won't work for someone who watches anime for amazement, but it is just about perfect for lovers of people and their stories. I really wish that I had discovered Studio Ghibli's movies before they went on hiatus. In my experience so far, the quality of their films ranges from good to some of the all-time best, and this one in every way deserves its status as a classic.",Kiki's Delivery Service
124,robertrutledge,"Uninspired ""Slice-of-Life"" Film",6,19 September 2021,"Hayao Miyazaki's film Kiki's Delivery Service may not be the director's worst film, but I personally cannot say I enjoyed watching it very much. While the animation (as with all of Miyazaki's films) is stellar, the storyline is rather weak, and the characters are uninteresting and rather forgettable. The movie is not as inspiring or creative as the director's other works. I must say this movie is a disappointment coming from the director of such great films such as Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke.The film centers around Kiki, a young witch who leaves home to pursue her witch training. She says goodbye to her parents (who play no significant roles whatsoever) and flies by night on her broomstick until she reaches a large city by the ocean. There she befriends a pregnant woman who owns a bakery, where she takes up residence in exchange for labor. However, she soon sets up her own business: the titular ""Delivery Service,"" comparable to FedEx or UPS (except only run by one person making deliveries using a broomstick as opposed to a truck).This movie has an indisputable ""slice-of-life"" tone. While it achieves what it sets out to do, I can't help but think the movie has no real overarching plot; no real continuity. There's no one problem or premise which the movie centers around. While the setting and the characters are believable (with the exception of Kiki, who is a witch), they are almost too believable. In fact, it would have been more interesting had there been more characters with magical powers like Kiki.One of the things that I'm puzzled about is how Kiki supposedly goes off on her own for her ""witch training."" However, when she arrives in the city, she doesn't know anybody. As opposed to her ""witch training,"" she randomly becomes somewhat of an apprentice at a bakery. Imagine if Harry Potter never went to Hogwarts and instead ended up enrolling in a ""muggle"" trade school. How is Kiki supposed to develop her skills as a witch without any sort of mentor who is also a witch? Or is her ""skill"" delivering packages to people? Nothing about her relationship with her parents or her or her family's place within the world of witches is ever expanded upon either.Alright, let's cut to the chase here. This film has a lot of up-skirt shots of the protagonist (the notorious ""fan service""). We could forgive Miyazaki if he was an immature twenty-something year old when he decided to implement these gratuitous touches, but that is not the case. Miyazaki was born in 1941, and this movie came out in 1989, which means he was 48 when this came out. Maybe it's a cultural thing, but I can't help thinking that throughout the film Kiki is sexualized through the overuse of unnecessary up-skirt shots.All things considered, this is not one of Hayao Miyazaki's better works. It's a cute idea, but the execution is poor. While the animation is beautiful, the story is simply not very memorable. There are no scenes that really stand out. The imaginative elements characteristic to the director are simply not present. The characters are uninteresting. The music is nothing special. Overall, this is not necessarily a bad movie, but there are much better ones out there.",Kiki's Delivery Service
125,ZachDVD,"Great film, though I prefer Totoro",10,4 September 1999,"Kiki's Delivery Service is a very good film, and Disney did not dub it down for it's United States release. It's by Miyazaki, who I think is the master of Anime, and this films proves it. He wrote, directed, produced, drew and much more in this coming of age story of a young witch who needs to gain self confidence. The artwork is amazing, the script is solid. I do prefer his film before this, My Neighbor Totoro, but this is still a great film. HAIL MIYAZAKI!",Kiki's Delivery Service
126,goc6283,An OK film but I don't recommend the English version of this film (at least the former),6,3 November 2014,"There happens to be 2 different dubs of this film. The most recently released English dub happens to be a lot more true to the Japanese story. Regardless of this, I highly don't recommend the English dub of this film. The voice acting is probably my least favorite of all of his translated films.Anyway: This film does not have a lot of the plot of Miyazaki's other films. It is a bit too whimsical for it's own good. Not much is learned by the main character and a lot of the environmental issues from his other films have been toned down. It just doesn't have the impact of his other films. No major lessons are learned and if anything this is the most Disney like of Miyazaki's films.I'd give the English dub a 3/10 and the Japanese version a 6.4/10. As the Japanese dub is more important, I'll rate it a 6.",Kiki's Delivery Service

This was my first anime movie, and I didn't know what to think of it, years later, I decided to go back down memory lane. I loved every minuet of this film.Kiki's delivery service is another brilliant Miyazaki film. The animation and story are uplifting and fun. The soundtrack is also fun, and the characters are well developed. All of the characters are rounded, and enjoyable. The story centers around a young 13 year old girl named Kiki, who is a witch, she has to leave home to begin her training. She comes across a nice city and decides to start a flying delivery service, along with her cat Jiji.As the film goes on she meets a boy named Tombo. Kiki is at first annoyed by him, but eventually becomes friends with him. kiki's training becomes more difficult as she is having a hard time trying to fit in, and she temporarily looses her witch powers. However she is able to recover them at the end of the film when she rushes to save Tombo's life, this urge to save Tombo gives Kiki her witch magic back and the film ends with her writing home.I would give this film a perfect score but the film feels short, and it actually drags at one point, but only for a few minutes. But bottom line, Kiki's delivery service is a fun, uplifting film, that any Miyazaki fan or just movie fan, as well as the family will enjoy!",Kiki's Delivery Service
128,Fiss,A tribute to Japanese Animation!,10,17 March 1999,"Many people can claim to be fans of Anime, or Japanese Animation.  It's been forced into the North American public by companies like Manga, US Corps and now, even Disney.Movies like Akira shocked the people...bringing surreal story and amazing animation to the screen.  Many others followed that simply blew away the animation and realism of American cartoons.But then they started to suck.  Bad.  Over-produced to feed the masses.And so, when I rented Kiki's Delivery Service, I was kinda expecting to be let down.  Knowing it would probably be some spoon-fed animation to appeal to the 3-6 year olds.Boy, was I wrong.  This movie was simply amazing.  The animation was wonderful.  Not too cartoony, but not too jagged and harsh.  Everything flowed smoothly and looked great.  The story was AMAZING.  It was what really shone.  Subtle lessons at life that even got me, a nineteen-year-old computer engineer, cheering for Kiki.  It is intelligent, thoughtful, and sweet to the max.Though this movie is the near exact opposite from all those mechanoid blood-baths and samurai show-downs that populate most of the Anime world...this simple little movie...with the great voice of Phil Hartman I might add...actually got me interested in Anime again.Check it out.

129,ryancortero,One of the most amazing and wholesome movies,10,14 September 2020,"Kiki's Delivery Service is such a fun and heartwarming movie that it's become of my favourite movies overall! It may sound like I'm exaggerating, but omg I teared up at parts of the movie where it was just a happy scene that wasn't made to make people cry. I was just so happy to see Kiki, the main character, fly through the air.The music definitely help during those moments and was probably the reason why it felt more powerful. The music is done by Joe Hisaishi, and he really captures the emotions well without even hearing the character talk. When we see Kiki fly, the music can be uplifting or very casual. If my life could have a soundtrack, I would use the music from this movie.I've only seen a few Studio Ghibli movies, but after seeing this, I'm hopeful to see if I can connect this much to any of the other ones. The animation looks really good for a movie that came out in 1989, and it still holds up. If you haven't seen this, I recommend checking it out! If you have already, give it a rewatch too!",Kiki's Delivery Service
130,avi-greene2,"10/10 for the original Japanese release, 6/10 for the English dub, song-wise, but I love the comedy of Phil Hartman as Jiji.",9,29 December 2017,"I love all the Studio Ghibli masterpieces that have been directed by Hayao Miyazaki, and feature an original score and original songs composed by Joe Hisaishi. This is a movie released in Japan that contains beautiful artwork, and a story to it where there is a thirteen-year old girl named Kiki. She is intending to be a witch-in-training, because it is a tradition that when a girl turns thirteen they go away for two years on broomsticks. That's what Kiki does with her beautiful black cat named Jiji. Together, they use Kiki's mother's broom, and go to a French town where Kiki stays with a baker named Osono. During her stay with Osono, Kiki loses her witch's powers, so she flies down a local hill where the broom breaks in half. A woman named Ursula then takes Kiki to her cabin/art studio, where Kiki learns that when she flies, she has to rely on what's inside of her. She then takes the broomstick of a man who lives in the same town as Osono, to save a local teenage boy who is learning all about aviation from Kiki. His name is Tombo, and he is seen taking Kiki on a tour of town on his bicycle that comes with a propeller so he can actually bike on air. It breaks, and they land on a beach shore, but this happens before Kiki loses her witch's powers later in the film. So, getting back to the part with Tombo when Kiki has a brand new broomstick, Tombo is seen riding on the bottom of a huge dirigible that flies into the town. What happens in that scene is that the dirigible is flying towards the top of a clock tower, and when it gets to that point there is a huge crash. Kiki has to save Tombo from falling down when the bottom of the dirigible breaks, and she has to rely on her spirit to save Tombo. She catches him, and they float down to a mat. Kiki writes to her parents at the end of the movie, to tell them her delivery service is going well, and that she misses home, and is getting comfortable where she is living now.About what my opinion is about this classic from Studio Ghibli in Tokyo, I love the songs at the beginning and end of the original Japanese release, and they are called ""Rouge no Dengon"" in the start of the movie, and ""Yasashisa ni tsutsumareta nara"" in the end. They respectively translate in English to ""Message in Rouge"", and ""If I've been enveloped in tenderness"". However, I have different opinions about the English dub. I am very entertained by the comedic acting of the late actor Phil Hartman, who voiced Jiji in the English release of this Miyazaki/Hisaishi project. The English dub also includes Kirsten Dunst as Kiki, Matthew Lawrence as Tombo, Debbie Reynolds as Osono, and Janeane Garofalo as Ursula. They are very good, too. What I probably have as the only complaint I have against the English dub is that the songs that were included in the Japanese release were replaced by two songs that I don't think were as good. They are ""Soarin'"" in the opening credits and ""I'm Gonna Fly"" in the end credits.All in all, though, I think this is a must check-out for everyone who is fond of anime.",Kiki's Delivery Service

133,zh84,"Suffers, I think, from being adapted from books rather than original",7,16 March 2007,"Of the true Ghibli films I have seen so far, this is my least favouritewhich is to say only that it's better than most ordinary films, rather than being astonishing. It has the usual beauty and attention to detail (somewhere there's a bus with an advertisement for ""Studio Ghibli"" on the side), with likable and interesting characters, but by comparison with other films such as ""Laputa: Castle in the Sky"", ""Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind"" and ""The Cat Returns"" I felt that the story was rather thin and erratic. I suspect this is because it is an adaptation of a book or books, which means inevitably things being cut out. Some of the incidents, such as the delivery of the ""toy cat"" to the little boy or the meal to the rich, surly girl, didn't seem to relate to anything else in the larger pattern of the story, and it ended with a rather perfunctory suspense scene in which I found myself getting annoyed with Kiki because instead of going below Tombo to rescue him, so that if he fell she would catch him easily, she insisted on going alongside him so that he had to reach out! I can't, of course, view this film with the eyes of an eight-year-old, as it's nearly thirty years too late, and as some reviewers on Amazon have said it may simply be a film for children, not adults. Nevertheless, this doesn't apply to ""Laputa"", ""Nausicaä"", ""The Cat Returns"", or even ""My Neighbour Totoro"", which is intended for toddlers.

139,bloodshot_sky,Growing up with your first job,9,10 June 2016,"Kiki is a witch who has reached adolescences and decides to move to a new town to find her calling. After a series of insightful experiences she decides to be a courier for a bakery. Over the course of her career she grows as a person and as a business person while struggling with all the difficulties of growing up and finding hardship. I realized very early on that this movie can be seen as an allegory for a young person moving to a new town and finding a new job and all the struggles and joys that come with that experience. Once again Studio Ghibli hits the perfect tone to express such a story as this as it's both whimsical and fantastical while still being relatable and set in a real world situation. One of my favorite things about this movie is how much the town is a big character. The setting of every Miyazaki film plays a big, memorable role in his films but I felt like Kiki's town was the most memorable and distinguishable. It might have been the directors approach to taking time to observe the people in the town as they walk around doing their business, or how he explores as many locations as possible. It all feels very real and special. The characters were all very enjoyable and well fleshed out, each one was memorable and added to the great appeal of the community that Kiki is navigating.My only criticism is the ending was a bit abrupt and felt a little rushed. Although Kiki saving her love interest from the blimp made for a heart touching and symbolic moment, it felt a little too over the top for a movie that was very low key and personal. I think by adding this huge disaster situation it took away from the real emotional challenges Kiki had to get over. Almost felt like a superhero ending when I would have rather preferred something more emotional and realistic, like her returning home and giving up then coming back to the city when she realizes what she has given up. I don't know, i'm not miyazaki...

141,tanis_38,Amazing,9,16 October 2001,"I happened to catch this movie on The Disney Channel last night.  I had heard good things about it from my friends, but it's overall theme just seemed too kiddie for me to watch.  But since Princess Monoke happens to be my all time favorite Anime, I decided to give it a chance.Wow!  I was blown away.  Hayao Miyazaki is a genius and a true master of his craft.  The animation is beautiful.  Miyazaki adds so many little details to the animation that other movies don't bother with, that really sets his movies apart and gives them an amazingly real, natural feel to them.  I was amazed by the scenes of Kiki flying on her broom; you really get a sense of flight unsurpassed by any other movie I've ever seen. 
I was surprised I enjoyed this movie as much as I did.  If you judge it from its cover you aren't giving it a chance.  A story about a 13 year old witch who leaves her home to begin her training.  Alright, that sounds like a great plot for a target audience of girls in the 6-13 year range.  I'm a 24 year old male and I can't recommend this movie enough. 
Go out and rent this movie as soon as possible.  I saw the dubbed pan&scan version on t.v. and I thought the dubbing was actually pretty good.  And I'm a die-hard subtitled anime fan.  So do yourself a favor, rent this movie, and enjoy the experience.  You won't regret it.",Kiki's Delivery Service

That is saying a lot, since there are other great movies to choose from, such as Color Purple, Sophie's Choice, Deer Hunter, etc...There's something magical, special about this movie, that it puts you in a combination of sad and happy. Every time I watch this movie, it makes me laugh, cry and smile.It's very difficult for me to explain why! The emotions, expression and 'acting' of characters are very realistic, it's almost like it's the same frequency to my soul.Just watch it. You won't regret it.",Kiki's Delivery Service

146,rustgold,"Don't need villains, just a cup of cocoa and a warm blanket",10,25 May 2017,"There's only a couple of tiny things I thought could have been better. Kiki comes off as rude to the boy, and you can't understand why the boy would like her. However, if you understand old cultural morals, that a girl isn't supposed to talk to strange boys, and not being rude would have been a blight on her character, the perspective of her interactions changes. The original Japanese version also showed an additional reason for her reaction, and when the English version toned down his original comment about her clothes, the English dubbers didn't quite convey it as well.Overall, it's a beautiful rendition of an alternative Europe. When you want to relax and do nothing one evening, get a cup of cocoa, tuck yourself under a warm blanket, and watch this.Btw: Don't listen to those disparaging the English version. Having now watched both versions, the English dubbed version is better in at least 90% of incidences where there's differences. So unless you have an incurable dislike to the westernised version of anything, watch the English dubbed version with Japanese music, it's the best.",Kiki's Delivery Service
147,trenttuttl,Another little film,10,22 July 2019,"Like ""My Neighbor Totoro."" And again, there isn't anything wrong with that.This was actually the first Miyazaki film I ever watched. Yes, way back in the early 2000s, I watched this film on VHS many times. So, along with ""Pokemon"" this was my first exposure to ""Anime"" as I'd later find out it was called.Enough reminiscing though, it's making me feel old, (I say, as a 17 year old). Anyway, of all of Miyazaki's ""little"" films this one is my favorite, without a doubt. Not just because of nostalgia though. I really connect with the film's msssage of finding yourself, and your place in the world. The fact that it focuses on a teenaged girl never bothered me either, (This coming from a teenaged boy). Kiki is my second favorite Ghibli girl, (With Princess Nausicaä being the first).Oh, and before I forget, the English dub of this film is pretty good. Normally, I don't watch Miyazaki's films, (Or any Japanese film, for that matter), dubbed. I always prefer to hear the original performances, but sometimes I make an exception for this film, (And ""Princess Mononoke's"" English dub). The dub in this film is top notch, particularly Phil Hartman as Jiji. Shame it was his final performance.Probably my 2nd favorite Ghibli film, overall, and another one I'd highly recommend.",Kiki's Delivery Service
148,otaking,A Japanese Animation marvel,10,7 September 1998,"Miyazaki produced, wrote, and directed this Japanese tale about a witch who must spend a year in another city to complete her training.  The Japanese dialogue, cast, and musical score were absolutely perfect, to suit Miyazaki 's perfectionistic attitude.  Recently, Disney released an awful Americanized version of the movie, which degraded the original intent.  I think I'll hang on to the original stuff, and let others buy the Disney version.",Kiki's Delivery Service
149,danny666,uplifting movie,10,26 January 2005,"Another great Miyazaki film. A young witch, with a good heart, leaves her mom and dad on her 13th birthday with her black cat, as all witches are supposed to do to complete her training and make it on her own. She looks for a city in need of a witch and finds a city near an ocean. She meets some other good hearted people who help her along the way.There really isn't a villain in the movie and it's mainly a slice of life type of film. In the end of the film it all comes together and she performs a heroic act.I tried to watch the dubbed version. Dunst was fine, but I just couldn't stand Garofolo and Hartman. So set the DVD audio to the original Japanese soundtrack and used English subtitles.If you watch the dubbed version. Turn on the subtitles and you will see all the additional dialog they added.

It is a pure and simple ""feel good"" experience that really shows you how one person's positive attitude, and determination can lead to great success. This is one of those moves that you can't help but feel good inside just by watching it.I recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for an opportunity to escape from the confines of responsibility, and ""life"" because it allows you to enter a world that so few of us can hope to live in. The adventures and experiences of Kiki can really are engaging, and I always left myself wondering what her next adventure would be.If you are looking for a good, family oriented movie that teaches the spirit of hope, then I recommend this to anyone.",Kiki's Delivery Service
151,ginger_the_Wolf,Everyone can enjoy this children's film.,8,3 September 2006,"To date, this is my fourth Miyazaki film, and although it ranks last, it's still a delightful and enjoyable film for children and adults alike. This is the story of a young witch, Kiki, who at the age of thirteen leaves home to learn how to live independently as a self sufficient witch. With her cat Gigi, she find herself in a sea coast town where she opens her own delivery service.Although this film takes a unique approach to the theme of ""be yourself"", it is still unfortunately a bit stale. It is the essential weakness of the film, from a more mature point of view, but it is otherwise a great approach for children. Miyazaki's story (not original...from a book, but his interpretation nonetheless) is a great portrait of a young girl who is discovering who she is through a series of interesting adventures.Finally, as always, the real strength of this film lies in it's stunning visuals. The wonderfully vibrant colours, and the sweeping landscapes really evoke a heightened reality that captures the imagination of so many.Nature plays a great part of this film, as it does with so many Miyazaki movies. It is something to be treasures and admired, linked to our own lives and destinies.",Kiki's Delivery Service
152,danbranan,"Simple, but beautiful and amazing!",10,3 June 2016,"I had pretty low expectations for this film, and perhaps that was a factor in why I ended up liking it so much. I thought the story sounded kind of lame, but I was completely mistaken. It's a simple story, and some people complain that it lacks a sense of conflict and is boring, but I couldn't disagree more. It's true that not a lot ""happens"" during the film, but it is so engaging and beautifully told that it doesn't matter. Miyazaki somehow manages to introduce suspense, pathos, joy, excitement - a truly amazing range of human emotion - in this very simple story about a young girl striking out on her own. And in typical Miyazaki fashion, he manages to craft a story that is equally effective and engaging for children and adults. He gets several statements across very effectively and subtly: always do good; be kind to others, even when they hurt you; if you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all; be true to yourself. In fact, this is one of my favorite films - period.",Kiki's Delivery Service
153,MattGrif,"A warm, charming and thoroughly enjoyable film.",9,24 November 1998,"""Kiki's Delivery Service"", the first of the Disney releases of Hayao Miyazaki's films, is a choice well made; if there were one film that typifies Miyazaki's unique style of storytelling, then this is it. It is not the most complicated, nor the most technically impressive of his works, but it possesses a charm and warmth that can be found in all of the director's films, before and since.In recent years, viewers of Disney's home-produced films have come to know what to expect of their films. In the eyes of anyone older than about 14, a Disney film (and indeed, the majority of western animated features) consists of a formula-driven story falling into the familiar hero-versus-villain pattern. Viewers expecting the same fare from ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" will be either disappointed, or pleasantly surprised.""Kiki's Delivery Service"" is the tale of a young apprentice witch, who, along with all witches when they turn 13, must leave home for 1 year to train alone. Kiki, whose best and only skill is flying, ups broomstick and leaves for a coastal town, where she befriends a bakery owner who suggests she uses her talent to set up a delivery service for the townsfolk.In comparison to the 'blockbuster' animated films, ""Kiki""'s pace is sedate, and for this reason younger viewers with a taste for frenetic action scenes and characters bursting spontaneously into song may well lose interest. Instead of the paint-by-numbers heroes and villains of usual animation stock, the characters of ""Kiki's Delivery Service"", like all of Miyazaki's films, have a depth and realism rarely found elsewhere - they could, by all rights, be real people with genuine thoughts and feelings, dreams and fears. What this film delivers, by way of its fresh outlook and thoughtful screenplay, is a warmth and delight that leaves you feeling uplifted by the end of the movie. For anyone looking for a light, charming and inoffensive piece of escapism, this is second to none.Whilst ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" cannot match the big-budget animated features for in-your-face visual impact, the film carries its own style; every scene bears intricately-rendered backgrounds bursting with colour and detail. The character animation is, however, unremarkable, and anyone au-fait with other Miyazaki films will find the styling of the characters very familiar - something which can be attributed to the fact that Miyazaki not only writes and directs, but also designs the characters. That said, Miyazaki's films strive to avoid the shortcuts often found in eastern animation, and the city streets bustle with activity in even the simplest of scenes.As to be expected from a Disney release, the voices of the characters are near spot-on; no easy task when considering that the English dialogue is dubbed onto an existing picture. Kirsten Dunst (of ""Jumanji"" and ""Small Soldiers"") lends Kiki a delightful innocence which befits the character perfectly, and the late Phil Hartman (who ""Simpsons"" fans will recognise as the voices of Troy McLure and Lionel Hutz) provides a witty and sarcastic turn as her black cat, Jiji. Likewise, the voices of the other characters feel and sound 'natural' - you would be hard pressed to tell that the film had been over-dubbed.""Kiki's Delivery Service"" is not a film that will ever be as recognised, as publicly lauded or as widely merchandised as the latest cinematic feature animation, but its quiet charm and genuine inspiration lend it a presence and credibility as a work of art as well as entertainment.",Kiki's Delivery Service

155,DiggiDoodle,Inspired,8,10 March 2021,"I went into this film completely unknowing of what I was in for, as I have with all Studio Ghibli films watched so far, and I'm telling you it is one of the best things I decided on doing, with series and movies alike. With that said, Kiki's Delivery Service truly is an understated work of art by Hayao Miyazaki, yet again.The story told is understated in the sense that it does not rely on big-budget special-effects, award-winning score and deep sessions of soul searching afterwards to make it a memorable experience. Rather, it takes a step back and allows for a more general and realistic approach of a young witch and her optimistic approach on finding herself in the world, by herself, later realizing that other people can play a big part in how you view the world and what part you can actually play in it.However, what I truly appreciated most about the film was the outline on how creativity and inspiration are not these consistent, unfailing, and ever-present factors found in their beholders. That, out-of-the-blue, one's love and devotion towards their skills and abilities can fall short, leaving the beholder scared and worried, feeling useless and daunted at what to do next. But then again, at the same time, can come back just as fortuitously, out-of-the-blue. This, in turn, then helping one feel inspired and having the nostalgic reinforcement, encouraging newfound respect and determination to dive further into the aspirations, goals and ambitions once felt since the days of a 'gifts' first arrival.This film definitely is a sight to behold.",Kiki's Delivery Service

But since I'm compelled to do so I'll do it.I don't want to say a word about plot, animation quality, music, dubbing etc. It's all unimportant in the face of what you'll be able to gain thanks to this movie.All I wanted too see was another Studio Ghibli production. I wanted to mark it as ""watched"" and go for the next. That was until I was caught by it. Feelings and ideals I thought I've lost irrevocably along the way were all of a sudden alive again. I was bored, sour, with mind and heart heavy with day-by-day little troubles and daunting routines. Then I saw this movie. I can't even properly call this little things that changed me but frankly I don't even want to call them at all. Maybe all the ""goodness"" just soaked through the screen? Maybe through the speakers?

Studi Ghibli have never ceased to amaze me; from Spirited Away to Grave of the Fireflies, i love them! The animation is superb with special attention to detail on the railway. The water that Osono pours out of the kettle is done brilliantly. It looks like real water and the steam that rises from it is also brilliant.The actual storyline was also very good: a thirteen year-old witch goes away to study for a year where she starts up her own delivery service.SPOILER: Meeting a range of characters, this temperamental teenager gets into trouble during her stay with Osono.

Kiki begins to live and starts a delivery business from the Bakery's attic. The people, adverisities and self-doubts that she faces in her Journey to becoming a self-independent individual, shape the movie's narrative.As Expected of Maestro Miyazaki the details in the animation are intricate and visually soothing. Even in a Children's Film he leaves us with some unanswered questions, that requires the viewer to come up with their own interpretations.

It just gave me a good feeling when i watch this movie it is so peaceful.  From the first scene when kiki lookng at the sky laying on the gas when the wind blowing -its so beautiful.  kiki is just a loveable character and also jiji the talking cat.

The flying scenes are done really well.  It is a very charming movie and was refreshing to watch compared to the usual Disney release.  I know there are two versions out in the US, the dubbed and subbed.  I saw the dubbed one as it was the only one available to me but I still enjoyed it.  I've read some more literal Japanese translation scripts online and the major differences I see are Jiji's lines.  In the dubbed version, Phil Hartman, the dubb voice throws in more punch lines.There are also some minor rewording such as changing ""coffee"" to ""hot chocolate"". I didn't think the Disney dub was that bad (I liked Phil Hartman's performance), however, I still have yet to see the widescreen sub version.

164,diana-sofronieva,Beautiful but a bit annoying,8,4 October 2018,"The animation is beautiful. I also enjoyed how heart-warming the movie is, how full of positive emotions. In fact, I see this as a plus - there are no villains, no excessive drama, just indulgence in positive emotions, for the most part. In general, I think that the movie business is over-saturating us with excessive drama and sensationalism, so I am very happy that I saw this exception that proves the rule. This is why I am giving it such a high rating. I like the gentleness of it!However, the movie plot is also annoying. Basically Kiki, for no merit of her own, meets all these wonderful people that just happen to want to help her in any way conceivable. She faces no challenges whatsoever, only the most minutest ones. She is not even very nice to the people around her, e.g. the boy that she keeps being cold towards. I cannot possibly understand why this boy keeps inviting Kiki out when she refuses to speak to him for no reason! Why does everyone like Kiki so much, when she has barely done anything to deserve this, or shown any particularly great character trait? She is a witch who can fly a broom, this is not even her own merit, it is not even something that she has worked towards, every witch can do this. Is this a reason to invite her to live at your house? Is this a reason for the artist to befriend her in the forest? Kiki then doesn't even keep in touch with the artist, as we learn - when she visits Kiki in the city, the artist says something along the lines of - you didn't come visit me, so I decided to do it! Is this a reason to have a boy invite her out over and over again, and wait in the rain when she isn't nice enough even to speak to him?What annoys me a lot in this filmis that the characters make so little sense, it feels completely unnatural. All these people are fascinated by Kiki, who is a decent girl, but doesn't deserve it any more than anyone else. If Kiki had faced a bit more of a challenge to deserve people's friendship, or if they weren't all that much lovey-dovey towards her, but more realistic - like if the boy invited her out only once or twice before she warms up towards him, if the artist didn't show so high levels of affection for what is basically a stranger, I would have loved the movie so much better.",Kiki's Delivery Service
165,alex_wimmer,Ravishing,8,13 October 2020,"(Spoilers are very mild) I enjoyed this magical coming of age story even more on the second viewing than on the first. It's filled with loveable characters and ideas; a black cat named Jiji is the perfect sidekick for Kiki, the young witch. It's only in some parts that the movie doesn't work as well for me as, say, My neighbor Totoro (from 1988). Maybe less would have been more in the last 15 minutes or so. But there is always something to like, and the end credits with their upbeat score are as irresistible as the bulk of the movie.",Kiki's Delivery Service
166,basset4,Lovely children's film,9,4 January 2010,"The film starts at the beginning of a journey. As dictated by traditional custom, young Kiki is granted independence at the age of thirteen so she may begin the year-long training away from home to cement her status as a bona fide witch. She leaves behind her loving parents and small town and relocates herself to a large city, which (though nonexistent) has distinctly European features. However, she soon learns that the rules of the city (and life) are not quite as she imagined. Eiko Kadono, author of the book on which the film is based, and Hayao Miyazaki, the screenwriter and director, are both Japanese. Although the film takes place in a made-up world, it can be said that those who craft the film leave their own mark on the story, demonstrating the proper values thought important. Kiki demonstrates the archetypal Japanese trait of showing respect for her elders.Since she has no special talents (except for flying on a broom, which she does haphazardly at best), her training consists of learning how to support herself, which she accomplishes by establishing an air delivery service (via broomstick). Kiki's growth as a character evolves through her interaction with her customers. At least three of her female customers act as second mothers, aiding her in the gradual transition from the sheltered childhood she knows into the reality of young adulthood. This supportive network of parental-substitutes allows Kiki, and young viewers, as well, to explore her new environment safely. Kiki's work ethic is impressive in a child so young. She earns the respect of adults through her earnest and diligent behavior. She also learns that items she took for granted before (food, cooking implements) cost money and can be somewhat expensive. She cooks and cleans for herself, and finds herself scrimping when money is low. Although she longs to own nice clothes, she notices that even the price on a pair of shoes she admires in a store window is equal to, or more than, the amount she spends on groceries alone.Even though Kiki serves as a role model towards young children, she also stands as a figure they can empathize with. She has the same doubts and disappointments as everyone else. Her stay in the city, for example, doesn't begin as well as she had hoped. The city is not warm and inviting like her hometown. Her attempts to introduce herself to strangers are at first met with indifference. She is insulted when an incredulous hotel desk clerk doesn't believe her when she asks to rent a room without her parents present. ""No one seems to like witches in this town,"" she observes sadly. Her sense of alienation is present whenever she is around children her age. When her new friend (and love interest) Tombo introduces her to his usual gang of friends, she finds herself unable to relate to them. She feels herself to be ""an outsider."" Her insecurities and failed self-confidence affects her ability to do magic: she can no longer fly a broomstick, and she can no longer communicate with her black cat, Jiji. She feels lost without the very thing that makes her feel special. Her host family and friends give her the emotional support she needs to regain her self-confidence. It is put to the ultimate test when she is the only one who can save Tombo, who is dangling from a rope attached to a runaway dirigible and faces certain death if he falls.Kiki's Delivery Service is a sweet, lovely film about what happens when life disrupts our preconceived notions, and the sense of loss and insecurity which takes place after. The pacing is sometimes slow and methodical, that might not work with younger elementary students. With its discussion of teenage independence, it will probably have the most developmental impact for children in their preteens. Recommended for 8- 12 year-olds, this is also a film that parents, too, can appreciate.",Kiki's Delivery Service
167,Zohariel,Incredible!,10,15 September 1999,"I was completely blown away by ""Kiki's Delivery Service"".  It's just wonderful. I had heard of ""Princess Mononoke"", as one of my favorite authors, Neil Gaiman, was involved. I still haven't seen ""Princess Mononoke"", and can't wait for the North American release, but meanwhile I found out that ""Kiki"" was by the same director, so I had to check it out. I expected it to be good, but it went way beyond that.  This movie touches on important themes like loneliness and growing up, in a very sensitive, human way. Disney normally avoids these subjects, or deals with them in a (by comparison) cliched, unrealistic or melodramatic way. Adults will be wary of it because it looks like a tacky B-grade kids' movie, but just take the time to sit down and really watch it, and despite any reservations you have, you will soon be entirely won over.I just can't recommend this enough.

A couple of years later I started watching it again, expecting to have outgrown it. To my surprise I sill loved this charming Miyazaki film. I watched part of it about an hour ago and it has not lost one bit of my admiration. It's about a 13 year old witch who must go away by herself for a year to complete her witch's training. She's takes a job as a delivery girl for a bakery owned by a woman named Osono and her husband. She also lives above the bakery garage with her cat, Gigi.

171,aranchas12,Excellent film,9,4 November 2015,"Hayao Miyazaki animated feature of a 13-old year witch leaving his parents and settling in a new town to form a (broom-based) delivery service is irresistible. As in many of his movies, the protagonist here is a plucky heroine defying all odds. What I found most enjoyable about the movie - though - is its background details. Miyazaki loves European culture - and the movie is set in never land Europe - a fantasized Europe that never existed. A lot of the clothes and the technology suggests the 1950s and the 1960s - but filtered through Miyazaki's sensibility (there are a number of anachronistic details that suggest perhaps a mid-20th century Europe if World War II had never happened). Miyazaki uses a lot of different sources in his movies - and they not always coalesce. In Porco Rosso, they didn't (Fascist Italy + Aviation Aces + Flying Pig?). But here they do.",Kiki's Delivery Service
172,mahlersoboes,A beautiful and introspective masterpiece,10,21 June 2005,"Having already been familiar with and a great admirer of some of Miyazaki's other Ghibli films, including Princess Mononoke, I turned to Kiki's Delivery Service on the recommendation of someone who suggested it as ""light-hearted"" fun. Being an eighteen-year-old male, I didn't think it would be much more than thata guilty pleasure to indulge in once in a while, something I could watch and then say, ""Aw, what a cute film!"" But Kiki's Delivery Service is so much more than ""light-hearted fun."" For one, it is a beautifully animated work of cinematic art, with Miyazaki's usual flair for gorgeous landscapes and astonishing detail. As in his recent films Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, Miyazaki's brush paints a beautiful world.There is not much to be said about the plot itself: Kiki is a 13-year-old witch who has just left home to begin a year of training on her own, and she moves to a seaside European town, befriends a husband and wife baker, and sets up a flying delivery service.What sets Kiki's Delivery Service apart from many of Miyazaki's other works is the personal, rather than epic, nature of the story. It wonderfully captures the day-to-day life of an aspiring 13-year-old girl moving into the life of a bustling town. While there is plenty to please the thrill-seeking adventurous spirit, the film's real beauty lies in its ability to portray the more introverted aspects of life. Most Western animated cinema centers around loud, pop-influenced music and a bad-guy-fighting action-oriented plot, but Kiki's Delivery Service has a charming and understated musical score, and lacks a traditional antagonist. Life isn't all excitement and fighting bad guyssomething that this film seems to get across more than any Disney, Pixar, Fox, or other Western animated film I've ever seen. In fact, the doldrums of life are what form the heart of this film, as Kiki finds that she begins to lose her witch's abilities and can no longer fly.Kiki's Delivery Service is a masterpiece, one of my all-time favorite films, and Kiki's search for the heart within herself is a tale that adults may appreciate more than their children. Indeed, Kiki is one of the most appealing characters that Miyazaki ever brought to life, which is certainly saying something. One of Miyazaki's great arts is in never talking down to his audience, and this fantastic story is no exception.",Kiki's Delivery Service
173,jcsmarchesi,"Charming, but the sub is better",8,4 August 2006,"I am a huge fan of Studio Ghibli. I can't fail to be dazzled by the sumptuous animation (which some call 'jerky', probably because of differing frames-per-second) and wonderful storytelling. In fact, they are much more talented than us westerners, especially Disney these days. Leading the way is Hayao Miyazaki, who is well known for his wonderful films, and this is no exception.Majo no takkyubin, or Kiki's Delivery Service, is an affectionate look at growing pains, responsibility and friendship, told through the eyes of a very kind and appealing witch. If you've seen it, you probably already know the plot, but if you haven't, read on. When Kiki turns 13, it is a tradition to leave her home and train in the real world, in a town where there are no other witches to communicate with and somewhere she can become more independent. It is here that she carries out a delivery service in the local bakery, and it is here she combats some of life's difficult stages. It's very simple, but incredibly effective.As with all Ghibli films, the animation is superb. The sights of Kiki flying around on her broomstick, the level of detail...I could go on about it all day. The dub is quite good...if you are comfortable with extra music shoved in your face in parts where it wasn't there originally (worse still, it's not even composed by Joe Hisashi!), the removal of two brilliant Japanese songs they should have kept in (unless it was a legal battle, but why have Disney's other dubs included their songs, and not these?) and extra dialogue, mostly by Phil Hartman's Jiji (why is Jiji male here and female in japan?). However Kirsten Dunst is true to Kiki's character (she pulls it off brilliantly), and Phil Hartman, while underrated, is good as Jiji. But as with all dubs, there's no escaping the sub, which is always superior. Then again, it's the original language of production, so why shouldn't it be better? It's no wonder why it was a hit in Japan; endearing characters, detailed animation and the simple story will delight many, including those who aren't fans of Ghibli, or Miyazaki. Recommended, as long as you can get a sub version as well.",Kiki's Delivery Service
174,skk184,Important for young viewers to watch,9,21 September 2020,"At the time of writing this in 2020, there has been a recent attempt over the last few years to increase awareness of mental health issues, and overcome the stigma that usually accompanies the topic. It was therefore pleasantly surprising to see that Studio Ghibli (Hayao Miyazaki) had been dealing with the subject matter over 30 years earlier. I recognize that there are plenty of other films where characters exhibit mental health issues, many that may have come out far before Kiki's Delivery Service, but Miyazaki's decision to make the main protagonist of a children's movie suffer from depression is something to be respected. I think every young child (and anyone else for that matter) would benefit greatly from watching Kiki's Delivery Service, as it very accurately depicts both the good and the bad parts of growing up, in an endearing and entertaining way.",Kiki's Delivery Service

So I have a few suggestions: perfect, perfect, amazing, beautiful, and did I forget to mention perfect? This is one of my favourite movies ever. The film is very appealing not only towards kids but for adults too, you feel for the characters because you can relate to them. Jiji is pretty funny in the movie, it has stunning animation that always feels active everywhere, the music is composed beautifully, the story doesn't need to be super intense or fantasy based, because the tension for me comes from relating myself to Kiki and imagining I have to face through what she does. Kiki is such a likable character as well, and like I mentioned, feels believable... despite the fact she's a witch, she is definitely a good role model. The writing is great, especially the conversations between Jiji and Kiki. The tone is very nice, and I definitely got absorbed into the beautiful atmosphere. I highly recommend people watch this film, I just cannot recommend it enough. It gets a 10 out of 10, although I wish I could rate it higher.",Kiki's Delivery Service

A really lovely story, with some absolutely mesmerising scenery drawings ... I really didn't know that there were genuinely excellent anime movies out there, but this one set me straight ... there are MORALS and ETHICAL CONCERNS in this cartoon (quite unusual for most anime ... eg, Dragon Ball Z, Yu-gi-oh, etc ...) This movie makes you feel things, or makes you understand what Kiki is feeling, and when it's finished it leaves you feeling very content, which is always good ... definitely worth watching (especially if you are a Phil Hartman or Kirsten Dunst fan, as they do the voice-overs for Jiji and Kiki respectively).",Kiki's Delivery Service

I really like those as they always take me back to childhood. I would have definitely enjoyed them if I was younger. Still a good movie.The story I really like the fact that compared with Howl's Moving Castle the story is more simple. At the same time it is too simple compared to My Neighbor Totoro. But, it is good story if you want to relax and enjoy yourself while watching something cute.The art What can I say? The art is beautiful as always. The sound Compared to Howl's Moving Castle the songs were better in my opinion. And the voice actors did a really good job.The characters They were really lovable. And as always when it comes to Miyazaki movies I tend to like the supporting characters a lot more. I don't know why, but they tend to be more goofy and I like that. Kiki reminds me of Bibi Blocksberg, I don't know why.Enjoyment I liked the movie, but it didn't make me say 'wow, I really need to watch this movie in the future'. It's a pretty story and it's like watching an old Disney movie.

184,RoboTR,On the US Version,8,1 November 2000,"It's a little strange to think that Disney would bring animation other than its own to American audiences, but that's what they did with Kiki's Delivery Service. Obviously they saw the special appeal of this movie, and definitely made the right move importing it to the States, if only on video. Kiki's Delivery Service is simply a beautiful film.The animation is amazing; bright, colorful, and affluent in life. Same thing with the characters, really. Voicing is very well done, including celebrities such as Jeneanne Geraffelo (please excuse the spelling if it's wrong) and the late Phil Hartman. However, these are all just icing on the superb story within this film. As Kiki tries to find her niche in life you are going to feel for her, even if she is just pen and ink. That alone signifies a great movie.Kiki's Delivery Service is an excellent movie for kids, but it's simple beauty and compelling story makes it suitable for any age or group. If you're too afraid of looking like a freak, go borrow someone else's kid for a while. You really don't want to miss this.",Kiki's Delivery Service

She eventually decides to run a (surprise) delivery service. But, of course, she has problems.It sounds like the fact that Kiki is a witch is incidental to the movie, and it almost is. This is what makes it work. There is no amazing spellcasting, no flamboyant effects, and no evil cackling. The point is that a young girl is going through a rite of passage, and her being a witch is only so that someone will actually watch the movie.And it's worth watching.

Since much has been said about children already, I'll talk about its adult appeal.During much of the movie Kiki experiences a kind of personal crisis. Trying not to reveal any spoilers, I'll just say that the crisis itself will appeal to anyone who is an artist, because all artists (including myself, a writer) have gone through what she does.There is no villain in this movie, but there doesn't have to be.

All of these complex aspects and more shine, unfettered, under the delicate hand of this extremely gifted writer and director.This film is a MUST-SEE for anyone, but especially for those who desire their daughters to have more positive role models than the many weak female (cinderella-type) characters offered in much of the animation/live action films available to them today.",Kiki's Delivery Service

And sure enough the movie was incredibly beautiful with nice details from several recognizable styles of European architecture.The plot seemed to develop nicely as well - especially in the beginning, where Kiki arives to the town. She's not allowed to fly her broom over the city - ooh, what will happend because of this? She meets this ""find Waldo""-kid who claims his grandmother was a witch too and even earlier some other stranger's mention of a witch(es) who used to live in the town. Is there a connection between the two? Is this town against witches under the friendly surface?And what about that mysterious artist living out in the forest? She must be connected to some sort of exciting backstory about how she had to escape the evil hands of the city. Right? RIGHT?!No. Kiki builds an okay successful delivery service, but suffers from burnout when her talent becomes a job, and therefore loses her ability to talk to her cat and to fly her broom. This is however easily fixed by a friendly chat with her artist friend and the sudden need to rescue Tombso... well, that got her ability to fly a broom back - the cat however never spoke again.. poor Jiji (Japanese version)I was baffled when the credits were presented at the end. Was this really it? And yes.. yes it was.. a masterpiece of drawings and designs wasted on a too shallow of a story...Good message, but with a lot of missed opportunities story-wise.Poor Jiji...",Kiki's Delivery Service

Her mom, for instance, is a healing witch. But all Kiki knows is flying, and everyone can do that! She must brave the outside world and find herself in order to become a full-blooded respectable witch. Sounds good, right? Well, it would be, if the script wasn't awful. The plot then goes into her flying delivery service way too much, and not enough into interesting things. Also, apparently most people believe in witches. Wouldn't it be more interesting if her witchitude was a source of problems between her and her new society? Worse, she is barely a witch, because there is no training, no finding of a new skill, barely any discussion of other witches, nada. There's also no 3-dimensional characters, almost nothing deep, enthralling, or unexpected, and NO REASON TO LIKE KIKI AS AN INDIVIDUAL!!! She's a happy-go-lucky bumbling 13-year-old girl, until she comes upon a friend who happens to be a boy her age, and then she acts like a cold-hearted shrew. Everything that should go wrong does, and everything that should go right does. Plus there are WAY too many shots of her underwear for a G-rated movie. Has Kiki never heard of wearing shorts under her witch's gown?! The only reason I did not give this movie a 1 is because the drawings are lovely. Oh, by the way, this must be set in France.

193,dbrewer-1,"More than most Anime movies, follows ""foreign film"" conventions",10,12 May 2004,"A fun, heartwarming movie. Unlike the sci-fi + action-heavy movies that mostly represent Japanese animation in America, this is more of a human interest story. In this way, it's more like the average ""foreign film"" in that it focuses on people, culture, and life. Aside from the fantasy elements of witchcraft and the extraneous subplot about the amateur flight club, this is a movie that celebrates wonderful aspects of life: learning who you are and how you fit into the world, creating yourself and the world you want to live in, honoring your past and friends, etc. Much like other Japanese imports (the recent ""Lost in Translation"", and this director's ""My Neighbor Totoro"" and ""Spirited Away""), this film really takes time to savor basic, real experiences like awkwardly meeting strangers, making them into friends, making and sharing and eating food, and living with people.It's a pretty scattered movie that hardly builds to a solid ending, but offers lots of beautiful moments along the way.",Kiki's Delivery Service

I will admit I've only seen ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" in English, but I feel grateful for the chance to view again and again this wonderful film. Truth is, I played the first tape until lines began to show - then was happy to purchase another tape as well as a DVD. For those who have fallen in love with the original production, I can only say this is not a mustache on the Mona Lisa, but the natural course such a charming story is going to take: Good things travel. Great things travel far. The setting is clearly not an American one, which adds to the fantasy. And the cast, to me at least, seems perfect. Having been owned by many cats, Jiji's role, played by the late and sorely missed Phil Hartman, could not have captured the feline personality better. Osono, Ursula, both offer friendship and guidance - without annoying handouts.This is not a fairytale where everything good happens without cost. Kiki scrubs floors. Kiki gets drenched. Kiki lose her inspiration. And maybe this is what enthralls American audiences who do know that you don't get something for nothing.

197,che_fox,Disney dub better than most,10,21 September 1998,"The new Disney dub into English of the Miyazaki classic, _Majo no Takkyuubin_ (known as _Kiki's Delivery Service_ here in the US) is much, much better than most of the drivel one finds in most American video stores. _Kiki's_ has not only big names, but lots of talent. Kirsten Dunst is at times obnoxiously teenaged, but the late Phil Hartman is as wonderful as ever. He's definitely a change from the almost feminine voice of SAKUMA Rei, but he manages to somehow add about 50% more lines without ruining the character of Jiji.As a dub, the quality is excellent. Other than a few minor botches (Osono offers Kiki hot chocolate in the new dub instead of coffee, then Kiki proceeds to put sugar and cream in her ""hot chocolate""!) the translation is pretty much perfect. It rarely falls prey to the problem of Japanese tending to express ideas in many more syllables than English needs, and thus the dub having lots of nonsense words to fill in the space.The added incidental music is, however, incredibly annoying, and supposedly one background song was removed entirely. Little 'vroom' sounds when Kiki flies on her broom, a huge kettle-drum 'bonggggg' in the most serious scene (Kiki saving Tombo) when Kiki hits a wall by accident, and a horrible 'In the Hall of the Mountain King' rendition whenever Kiki is embarassed made me wince again and again. They were not only almost completely synthesized music (there was a real violinist, a real flautist, and a real female voice) but it was *terrible* synthesized music. C'est la vie -- let's hope Disney doesn't butcher the music for the next Miyazaki translation, _Tenkuu no Shiro RAPYUTA_ (to be known in the US as _Castle in the Sky_ due to the official English title _Laputa: Castle in the Sky_ having an unfortunate meaning in Spanish).All in all, the new dub of _Kiki's_ is far, far better than the rows and rows of huge guns/huge-chested women anime one finds nowadays at the video store.

Anime purists will rant and rave about the ""horrible dubbing"" just for the sake of dub-bashing, but you don't need to listen to them.

199,joshuatull,"Yes, a seventeen-year-old boy likes this film...",10,29 February 2000,"I just saw ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" a day ago, just to take a look. I had recently gotten into anime, and despite the fact that this movie was dubbed (I knew that most films were better subtitled) and that it was also on the Disney Channel, I expected to be in bed at ten thirty. But I found myself still awake at twelve, watching the credits till the very end, tears streaming down my face. This is such an indescribably incredible movie that I, a seventeen-year-old boy, am not afraid to admit that this movie made me cry and touched me like very few have ever done. (The last time I remember crying after an animated movie was the Care Bears movie at age seven.) It was at the end when they began to flow, at the dedication to Phil Hartman, a man I had admired for so long. That wouldn't have done it if it weren't for the perfectly drawn and conceptualized town, a beautiful setting that gives me that forlorn feeling that never will there be a time when bakeries are personal, when people will give you friendly directions, when you can get a job and boarding simply by offering to work for the establishment, when the streets and nicely painted homes are clean, when club parties require dressing nicely, when high technology is a dirigible, when girls wear dresses normally, when people laugh simply for the sheer joy of it, and when the world is absolutely perfect. That did it. Everywhere the common opinion is that the Disney dubbed version is horrible compared to the original movie, but I think that the voice actors, at least, did a great job. Although Phil Hartman's voice is somewhat unexpected from a small kitten, I grew used to his voice and I even think he was great in the role, because I've heard that he kept the personality of Jiji and still added a few jokes, which I didn't mind. Everyone else fit well. I will now go out and by the Japanese subtitled version of this film, on DVD. As an animation buff whose ultimate goal is to one day be in the big leagues with Disney and Dreamworks, this movie has inspired me immeasurably. It might seem odd to have such a reaction to this movie as I have, but animation has always been my dream and will soon be my life. I can only recommend this movie to every single person, whether they will like it for its touching story, or its flawless animation, or its incredible setting.

The dubbed version did have famous actors doing the voice overs. (Phil Hartman as the cat etc...) I still preferred the subtitled version, although it was a good dubbing job. Although I usually like more action oriented movies (Matrix etc...) the animation was beautiful and engaging. The sense of flight and movement is strong and the backgrounds of the city make it seem like a scenic vacation area that you want to sight see. The story although slow paced and simple is like a timeless parable of growing up and going out on your own. Quality of the images is important so try to see it in an actual theatre or on the best and largest screen possible.",Kiki's Delivery Service

202,williamye,"Personal favourite, and the reason I'm here",10,30 October 2019,"Those who are familiar with Studio ghibli's work will know that each film diverse heavily in their stories and settings. But one of the common themes that I adore most, is that of the characters are of pure heart. When watching any of their films, I never try to anticipate what will happen, but rather ride along with the emotions of the characters and ""feel"" their situation as it unfolds. And Kiki... Felt right at home...If I told you the film was about a coming of age girl leaving home to explore a new city and commence her training as a witch, the first thing that comes to mind might be something like Hermione from Harry Potter...which in my opinion does not justify this film at all. Hence explaining this film may be counter productive... But I still feel the need to express.So... What makes Kiki the best film ever? In my opinion, the simplest things...but it's the little things that counts..eg
When Kiki pulls her hand quickly from the oven and the sweat drips over her face for just a glimpse, you could feel how hot that oven was...
When she lifts a package as she wedges slowly towards the scale, you could feel how heavy it was....
When she gets woken at dusk but couldn't go back to sleep, she sneaks to the loo but shys away when she notices someone was coming, you could feel how embarassed she was...
And when she is confronted with everyday human behaviour in our hustle and bustle life , you could feel how discouraged she was ...(tear)There are just sooo many ""aww"" moments, that you couldn't possibly be focusing on the film and not be smiling, even when it ends.Kiki's delivery service is a fantasy that reminds me of a time where my younger self once dreamed of the adventures that life had to offer, free of hate, free of lust, free of ill will....Kiki also reminds me of a special someone that is no longer around....I miss you Kiki.",Kiki's Delivery Service

One day, she comes to lose her ability to fly.....I think this movie is a touching movie though it is animation. I can also say it is unrealistic because Kiki is able to fly and understand Jiji's talking. However, I can cheer Kiki if I image that I fail and feel down. There is Kiki's development in her training for a witch because she has difficulties and she troubles about it. I think the plot of this movie is heart-warming.",Kiki's Delivery Service
206,rubenleobcn,Lovely Anime,10,9 February 2016,"Pretty ideal for children by the simplicity of its plot. Miyazaki style recognized from the beginning, with scenes reminiscent of the adventures of Sherlock Holmes, mixing objects and different times, with landscapes and peoples of Central Europe so fond, and beginning to introduce a bit of magic and fantasy prelude to Howl's Moving Castle. The Studio Ghibli films always have background, simple as it seems the argument. In this case, a great history of overcoming, sometimes upstream. Good film with a good OST, and amazing animation, and also good plot. The best, the background and what fun it is short and makes you end up with a very good feeling. Highly recommended.",Kiki's Delivery Service
207,washu_chan,"it's ""deep""",10,17 June 2003,"Watch the movie and you'll see all kind of sweetness, and heart warming element, read Miyazaki's personal comment about the film theme and you know it is a genius work. While most adult cartoon from Japan or USA are not appropriate for kids, this one is will entertain a kid, and cherish an adult. The actual theme is about struggle of young ladies between dependence and independence. I won't elaborate more to it, reading the article at nausicaa.net would fulfill any curious minds.some SPOILER! To me personally, maybe I took this movie way too far...but I relate so much to Kiki character, and even further, her parents. I can see the impulsive, somehow a bit care free Kiki making the sudden decision to leave even when her father has prepared the gear for a camping trip. Then I relate to her parents, her father who care so much for her, still remembering her as a little witch. I love the lift high high scene so much. Also her mother who (for a good reason) thinks she is too young or inexperienced to leave. Yet they sacrifice their own feelings and wish Kiki all the best. The goodbye scene is somehow a bit tearful for me.Then of course, seeing Kiki losing the very single thing that she's only able to do is devastating. The telephone conversation scene was very sad. It is unnecessary to show if she cries in her despair, nevertheless she is still making a new broom in an effort to fly again. Yes, she is in sorrow, but she doesn't give up. What a character.Somehow I got a bit annoyed by Tombo who seems insensitive of how Kiki feels, but at the same time I'm glad he provides her with comedy relief. It is really hard to claim any presence of a crush at all. Whether Tombo uses his flight interest just as an excuse to get to know Kiki, or whether Kiki wants to go to the party in need for a same age level friend or she actually sees a sincerity in Tombo acts.Then the movie ENDS!!!!! (of course the heroine saves the day was easily predicted, but the profound execution of the scenes makes up for it)....hey, what's going on here, the plot was all so sweet until suddenly comes the normal drill and the movie ends...it ends....why....whyyyyyyy!??!??! it feels as if I'm awaken from the most beautiful dream I ever have... oh well....At least it is only a year in the new city, if I can continue the story myself, she'll return home after a year,  have that camping trip with father and mother (we miss you Kiki..sob), sharing all her joys and sorrows. Then she'll learn all her mothers knowledge as she's more responsible now. She'll go back and forth from her home and Koriko (delivery service going well ), her parents visiting her. Then she one day saves an exhausted Ifurita from Wanderers, Ifurita becomes her best friend & guardian, and helps the growing delivery service (hehe, she has a child character and can fly too, stronger, faster, a bit clumsier)....but that's another story ;)",Kiki's Delivery Service
208,uebt,Kiki always delivers smile to us.,10,11 July 2010,"""Kiki' s deliver service"" is the 5th film that Hayao Miyazaki has directed. Mr. Miyazaki is one of the Japanese greatest animation director. The film is based on a bestselling Japanese children's book of same name written by Eiko Kakuno. The main character Kiki is a little ""witch"", but there are no negative images of it like a curse and evil. The film focus on independence and growth of a girl, and a sensitive portrait of her daily life. And this is the most profitable film in 1989 in Japan.Kiki, a daughter of a human father and a witch mother leaves a house with talking cat Gigi under a full moon as a witch-training journey when she reaches her 13 birthday. Then she rooms at a bakery's house in seaside town. Meanwhile, she opens a deliver service by taking advantage of her magical power for flight using a broom. Sometimes she feels down about her tough work, but she draws her inspiration from Usutora who is an art student, and get her strength back. Then one day, her friend Tombo hangs in midair from airplane,and Kiki fly out of the door to help him...When I was 10 years old, I saw the movie for the first time. At that time I was just excited beautiful Kiki's flying scenes. And now I'm 20 years, I throw a new look at the movie, I am deeply touched by the story of a little girl Kiki who are struggling to live her own life. Her lovely smile always makes me happy. I am a big Kiki's fan now and forever.",Kiki's Delivery Service

210,kylering,A wonderful film for animation fans of all ages,10,18 February 2012,"I remember seeing advertisements for this movie as a child, and I must say I now feel like I missed out.The dub is decent, feeling faithful to the original and even adding a few welcome elements. I especially like the personality of Kiki's cat JiJi.The animation is gorgeous in this film. There's never a shot that failed to impress me. The visuals are well detailed and everything's bright and colorful. Even by today's standards this film is beautifully animated, and it has a very distinctive feel, as if I could look at a movie with this style and instantly know ""Yep, that's a Miyazaki work right there."" I could gush over the visuals alone for hours on end.The characters were great too. Not every character got an equal amount of development, but I found that very fitting. Kiki was the main focus of the story, and you could really take away from all her experiences just as much as she could. The supporting cast got just the right amount of focus for the role they played in the story.There wasn't too much of a plot to this movie, but I personally feel it didn't need one. The film is meant to just be a simple, slice of life type of film, just watching Kiki as she grows as a young woman.This movie is amazing, and after watching it, I can see why Hayao Miyazaki is known as ""The Walt Disney of Japan"". He's managed to craft a wonderfully written, beautifully depicted masterpiece of a film that'll entertain viewers of any age.I've heard tell that he has many films that are just as good if not better, and if this movie serves as the precedent, I can't wait to get a look at them.",Kiki's Delivery Service
211,matz-blesserholt,Use the Japanese dialogue,9,26 July 2004,"A excellent movie for kids as well as adult. Can be seen again and again. I found that almost every Miyazaki movie has a struggling fighting girl, which has to fight for make a decent or a happy living.I wish they had use British English in the English version, since the little town is very European (could be Austria as Well as France. The American dialogue completely destroys the harmony of the film. It is shame that Disney got the hands on Miyazaki's production and work. If you don't understand Japanese use the subtitles. Even the music is better. What's wrong with Japanese music anyway to a English version ???? For example: 'Mononoke hime' has a dialogue which makes the movie more or less to another movie in English.",Kiki's Delivery Service
212,bex753,I can't recommend this enough,9,8 September 2004,"The saddoes who vote this down for there own sick reason and there are some 2.2% give it one ,and there are not many films that deserve a vote of one and if you are one of the 61 you have no heart and I am coming round your home to throw your computer out the window or sort you out Jay and Silent Bob style. That's my rant about the voting system out of the way VERY few films deserve 1 and even fewer deserve 10 be honest with your voteAnyway Kiki's Delivery Service is one of the few films that has something for everyone. No on dies, gets shot or hurts someone else its just a really nice simple film that can make you feel better when life's crap gets to youThat's My 10 pence worth just don't vote anything 1 or 10Sorry I get a bit random at times but thats just me",Kiki's Delivery Service

214,sasdragon,sasdragon's Kiki's Delivery Service review.,8,23 June 2012,"Kiki's Delivery Service 1989 Directed by: Hayao Miyazaki Rating: Highly recommended 6/23/2012 IMDb Synopsis: A young witch, on her mandatory year of independent life, finds fitting into a new community difficult while she supports herself by running an air courier service.This review contains spoilersI am a fan of Hayao Miyazaki and the works of Studio Ghibli. And this film is not an exception to that fandom. I have just finished watching Kiki's Delivery Service for the first time and, as I expected, I was very pleased. Hayao Miyazaki is, in my humble opinion, one of, if not the, most exceptionally talented animation directors of our time. His films reach into us and bring out the best and brightest, as well as, sometimes, the darker and more terrifying parts of ourselves. Kiki's Delivery Service shows the director, and the rest of his incredibly talented crew, near the top of their game. To me it's the subtle touches in the film that really set it apart. For instance, the fluttering of the hair on characters throughout. The way that Barsa, childishly, makes swooshing noises while sitting upon Kiki's Broom Stick. One instance in particular surprised me, while Kiki was walking through the city, shopping, and a few girls are center- framed and their conversation about how cute a boy is, can be heard. The way that these background characters are animated suggests that they might bump into Kiki and become prominent characters, but instead they simply pass her by, and the film continues. The subtle, extra, touches go a long way, and do not go un-noticed by film goers. And it brings an all together more immersive experience. Kiki is also a shining example of how Ghibli films can make you greatly enjoy the company of the characters on screen. Whether it be the title witch-in-training herself, and her struggles to find her place in this big world. Tombo, the boy who is head over heels for Kiki, when he first sees her and realizes she's a witch. Or Jiji the worrisome, complaining black cat. The animation is, as expected, outstanding. The visuals are bright and colorful. And there's always a lot going on on-screen. For instance during the finale dirigible crashing sequence, as if a police car falling off and into a pool isn't enough to look at, they also add a solitary person still in the pool, being pushed to the side by the waves created. As mentioned, the color scheme helps to pull you in, whether it be bright and beautiful day scenes, or dark rain pounded storm scenes, you're always engaged.I watched the film with the English dub (I know, boo), however it's done pretty well considering. To the best of my knowledge, and memory, Ghibli English dubs seem to have a lot of talent behind the microphone. For example this film has Kirsten Dunst (Spider-Man trilogy,) as Kiki, the late Phil Hartman (Saturday Night Live, Simpsons) as Jiji, Tress MacNeille (Simpsons, Futurama) as Osono, the caring shop owner who allows Kiki to live within her shop. So, thankfully, watching this film with the English dub is actually quite pleasant. To me there's so much more going on than just the main plot of Kiki trying to find her place and the later plot point that she seems to be losing her powers. Whether it be the love that Tombo seems to hold for Kiki, and his initial failed attempts to express it. Or that almost immediately after Kiki expressed that her love for flying has dwindled since she made a career out of it, her powers start to give out. The strong, albeit quickly noted, emotions that rise when Kiki can no longer communicate with Jiji. Or the fact that Barsa seems unsure of whether to be terrified or entertained while watching the tragic events with the dirigible unfold in front of her on television. Also the fact that besides one or two very minor exceptions, the film remains child friendly throughout. With animated films nowadays often delving into darker territories or subtly slipping in adult humor amongst the childish events, it's refreshing to take a gander at a film like this that represents, mostly the best of humankind. In my poor dark mind, hitchhiking can only lead to dark and terrifying things, because I've watched too many horror movies to think otherwise. But thankfully this film depicts the activity as being safe and even friendly. Perhaps I'm delving way too far into things. To me it's these smaller, often unexplored, details that make the film stand out amongst the crowd of other animated features. That along with the instantly recognizable style of animation. With lovable characters, brilliant animation and a great story, along with pleasant pacing, comes an extremely solid review of highly recommended.",Kiki's Delivery Service
215,GeneralSurprise,My favorite Ghibli,10,24 October 2005,"Why? Pay attention, because you won't hear many guys my age say this: It's adorable. Yeah, I said it. I'm not ashamed. This movie is fantastic!While it may be a rehashed version of a popular Japanese book, our buddy Miyazaki gave it an excellent treatment. Production costs for this movie almost broke Ghibli's bank in 1989, and it shows. It looks great, it sounds great, and it feels great. We start with a young witch named Kiki. She's closing the gap on 13, which is the time when young witches must leave home and forge a life of their own for one full year. After a bittersweet ""goodbye,"" she finds herself in a beautiful oceanside town. At first, she's treated with bewildered looks and sneers (after all, how crazy would it be if some random little girl on a broom started buzzing around YOUR house?). But before long, she institutes a flying delivery service and becomes a local star. Every bit of this movie is worth watching. I have nothing negative to say at all. From first frame to last, it's a classic. No, a legend.",Kiki's Delivery Service
216,HussamD,Amazing and fun movie for all ages,10,15 October 2020,Best Japanese movie I have ever watched. A story that gives hope tells you that human ambition has no limit. There is no doubt that it is one of the greatest productions of Studio Ghibli.,Kiki's Delivery Service
217,camicoop,would recommend :D,10,22 July 2018,This was one of the first studio ghibli films i had seen and i was pleasantly surprised. it's a really sweet and cute movie and i believe it is suitable for all ages :>,Kiki's Delivery Service
218,jamesseaba,A definite misstep for Miyazaki,2,26 May 2020,"Don't get me wrong, I love Studio Ghibli. My whole family does. My three-year old daughter watches Totoro at least once a week, and my wife and I love his films that are tailored for older audiences like Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, etc.We are very selective on what our daughter watches-allowing only positive role models, good lessons, and developmentally appropriate conflict. Totoro embodies all of these in a beautiful, human masterpiece of animation. Kiki's just... doesn't. Despite all of the reviews we read from parents who said, ""If you like Totoro, you'll like Kiki's too!""The animation is there. But nothing else is.The characters are all virtually static aside from Kiki, who also sorely lacks in any substantial development. It almost feels like she regresses in development until the very end. Beginning to obsess over her looks, etc. which never gets addressed at all outside of one scene in passing, but it seems like it's building into a major plot point that never materialized into anything. The other children passing through are all either rude or downright mean and are never called out for it, requiring a lot of contextualizing and discussion during the movie of, ""How would it make you feel if somebody did that to you?"" Be award of this if you're planning to watch with a younger child.And then Jiji the cat, the voice of reason and the only valuable comic relief, is quite literally silenced half way through the film never to speak again.Then we get into the run time of almost two hours. Which would be fine if there was a more engaging plot. But it's not. It's slow and trodding, culminating in a climax in the last ten minutes of the movie followed by the most abrupt credits roll I've ever seen in any movie.Also: definitely some weird, racy humor in a couple scenes. It mostly flies by, but it's still unsettling. One scene in particular comes to mind where Kiki tells Jiji that the artist wants to paint her, to which Jiji responds, ""Naked?!""...KIKI IS 13!!!Also horrendous sound editing in the Disney version. It sounds like Kiki is talking into a fan the entire movie (which makes it ironic when she actually is in one scene.) Very grating on the ears.So in summary, sorry other parents-this isn't Totoro 2.0. It's not a beautifully crafted story woven into a deep, magical dreamscape of animation. It's... Miyazaki animation with a throw-away, bargain bin script for 2 hours. Not sure why it receives such high praise outside of being Studio Ghibli.",Kiki's Delivery Service
