0,MartinHafer,A thinking person's western.,9,26 January 2012,"So often, the images you see in American western films are all pretty much the same--cowboys, Indians, evil bosses trying to steal land from the little guy, gunfights in the streets and heroes who are practically invincible. Unfortunately, most of this is wrong--historically speaking. Most folks out west did NOT wear cowboy hats, the Indians were generally pretty peaceful and a gunfight....well, when they did occur, it usually was one guy shooting another in the back--never at 'high noon' in the main street. Because of all these inaccuracies, I love ""Jeremiah Johnson""--a film that de-romanticizes the west and shows what life was really like in the early days of western expansion.The things I also love about this film are its slow pace, underplayed acting (aside from a memorable scene with Will Geer and a bear) and sense of beauty in the great outdoors. The bottom line is that this is a film for the thinking person--someone who is willing to see something other than shootouts and the like. Gorgeous, well directed and, at times, profoundly moving. See this film--it's one of Robert Redford's best.",Jeremiah Johnson
1,bkoganbing,The Mountain Man Experience,7,1 April 2014,"Jeremiah Johnson is the third of a troika of films about the mountain man experience, Clark Gable's Across The Wide Missouri and Charlton Heston's The Mountain Men being the other two. One of these days there will be a good biographical film of Kit Carson, the greatest of the lot.Robert Redford in the title role gets in on the last years of the mountain man experience. These guys trapped for the fur pelts living months and sometimes running into years before they came down to sell their goods. They lived alone among the Indians, hostile or not, and being that repeating rifles had not yet been invented the Indians had numerical and firepower advantage over them. They had to be one hardy breed of men as Redford and the others show.Initially Redford lucks out winning the respect of the Indians when he avenges a crazy woman's massacre of her family. The Indians hold the insane in respect even though Redford kills several Indians doing it. They even give him an Indian bride in Delle Bolton.His luck runs out when he reluctantly guides a party of soldiers through an Indian burial ground. After that they don't let up in trying to kill him and his loved ones. Being the noted conservationist that he is I'm sure Robert Redford loved shooting in the national parks which are preserved as they were in the time of Kit Carson, Jim Bridger and the rest. Some beautiful cinematography is another hallmark of Jeremiah Johnson.One of Robert Redford's best and most interesting characters he's brought to the big screen, this Jeremiah Johnson.",Jeremiah Johnson
2,Leofwine_draca,The Revenant of its day,10,19 December 2016,"JEREMIAH JOHNSON is a leisurely-paced and enthralling true-life 'mountain man' story directed by the reliable Sydney Pollack and starring the excellent Robert Redford as a man who decides to get away from the humdrum existence of society life and literally retire to a cabin in the mountains. The film chronicles his encounters with various oddball characters and local Indian tribes, with the latter half of the production moving into action-adventure territory.What I liked about this film is the naturalistic feel. There's not a wealth of dialogue here and most of the shots emphasise man's stature dwarfed by the extent and brutality of the natural world about him. I always enjoy 'back to nature' films such as this and JEREMIAH JOHNSON doesn't disappoint, whether it's chronicling Redford fighting against the elements or a wolf pack or enjoying quieter, more contemplative moments.The supporting cast is well drawn and the over the top performances work well. When the film moves into revenge territory in the latter part it becomes madly exciting and thoroughly thrilling. I also liked the dark and brutal edge despite the family friendly rating; it gives the film that unmistakable '70s gritty vibe. JEREMIAH JOHNSON truly is THE REVENANT of its day and you'd struggle to find a better depiction of wilderness life or the power struggles of the great outdoors between indigenous tribes.",Jeremiah Johnson
3,SnoopyStyle,Searching for America,7,28 June 2014,"Mexican war veteran Jeremiah Johnson (Robert Redford) is tired of the world and seeks to be a mountain man trapper. He struggles to survive until he runs into the frozen body of Hatchet Jack clutching his .50 caliber gun. It proves to be a much needed gun. Then he meets another mountain man Bear Claw (Will Geer) who takes him under his wing. He encounters Crow chief Paints-His-Shirt-Red and eventually befriends him. He runs across homesteader (Allyn Ann McLerie) and her mute son just after a Blackfeet raid. She pushes him to adopt her son whom Johnson calls Caleb. The duo go off and run across Del Gue (Stefan Gierasch) who the Blackfeet had buried up to his neck. Gue and Jeremiah find a Blackfeet camp ending up killing the Blackfeet. Jeremiah is disgusted with Gue taking scalps. The group meets Flathead indians who are in awe of Jeremiah. They assume he killed their enemy Blackfeet to avenge the crazy white woman of big medicine when they see the scalps. When he gives them the scalps and the Blackfoot ponies, the chief needs to give an even greater gift, his daughter Swan. Gue leaves them and Jeremiah is saddled with a son and wife neither of which he wanted. They eventually become a family with a cabin. Then the US Cavalry convinces Jeremiah to search for a wagon train. They go through a sacred Crow burial ground despite Jeremiah's objection. The Crow slaughters Caleb and Swan which sets off a long running quest for revenge.Coming at a time of disenchantment, the public was ready to run away and rediscover America. At first glance, Robert Redford seems too refined for a mountain man role. However even Jeremiah didn't start out as a mountain man. Redford can slowly transition into a more rugged character. Sadly in the end, he fails to get to the truly insane mountain man character. He just doesn't have that in him.The movie moves a little too slowly at times. Director Sydney Pollack could have tighten up the pacing a bit. There's a more melodic feel coming from this movie. It's not really the same as a Clint Eastwood and Sam Peckinpah western. I would expect that version would be more brutal. That may be a good idea for a remake.",Jeremiah Johnson
4,Hitchcoc,A Well Turned Allegory,9,15 February 2011,"Having taken a real interest in American Studies, I came across the writings of Vardis Fisher, upon whose book this is based. This is a movie as quiet as the open spaces that surround the title character. Not unlike a Greek tragedy, Johnson is drawn to his purpose and seems resolved to it. There is never any other reason for him to be a mountain man than he sees it that way. What follows is a slice of Western life that tears at the soul and takes everything the man can give. Along the way, we meet adversaries of every kind, each a way to true knowledge, which is what this movie is really about. Will Geer's character, Bear Claw, takes the man and begins to mold him, but his baptism is certainly of fire. He knows the bragging tenderfoot has never encountered a beat, and he knows that he will have to perform or die. There is a complex relationship with the Indians of the time. This book pulls the stereotypes out from under them and we begin to know their unique tendencies. With each passing encounter, which includes the tragic loss of the thing he loves the most, he comes to an uncertain peace. Purification through suffering is as old as the Iliad.",Jeremiah Johnson
5,classicsoncall,"""Mountain's got it's own ways.""",8,21 February 2015,"I just read an account of Robert Redford stating that one of his takes at the end of the movie where he gnashed his teeth at Paints-His-Shirt-Red was inadvertent and was the one that wound up in the film. When I saw it, I felt he was containing his rage and showing a measure of respect for his Crow Indian foe long after his Flathead wife Swan (Delle Bolton) and companion Caleb (Josh Albee) were slain by the Indian or one of his tribe. It was a way for the viewer to comprehend that Jeremiah Johnson understood that the Crow revenge for going through their sacred burial ground was to their way of thinking justified. At least that's what I got out of it.After watching the movie, one gets the impression that getting back to nature might not be the best idea going. At least not 1800's style. Hunting, trapping and freezing to death to make a living is not the panacea one might envision in a wistful reverie about living off the land. Of course the Indian threat is much less today, but surviving brutal winters outdoors is never fun. It's been below zero every morning where I live for the past week.What's never made clear in the story is why Jeremiah Johnson gave up on civilization in the first place. One could come up with a few ideas but they'd be only guesses. A brief mention is made of the Mexican War but Johnson didn't have a problem with violence when you come right down to it. I would like to have better understood his motivation.The picture is gorgeously filmed and the scenery is outstanding. As a man without a plan, Johnson winds up wherever life takes him meeting colorful characters along the way. There's a sort of romanticism to it in it's own way, but always slammed with a harsh measure of reality every time other human beings are involved.",Jeremiah Johnson
6,gavin6942,The Essential Mountain Man Movie?,8,28 April 2011,"A mountain man (Robert Redford) who wishes to live the life of a hermit becomes the unwilling object of a long vendetta.I love Robert Redford. I have a tendency to lump him with Paul Newman, but the fact is that I love Redford more than Newman. If there was a Redford's Own salad dressing, I would smother myself in it and roll around in lettuce and tomatoes.The music in this film for some reason reminds me of ""Seven Brides For Seven Brothers"", which may not be a bad thing, since that is a good movie and they seem to be set in similar times.For some reason, this movie strikes me a subtle comedy. It really should not, probably, because of the massacres and death, and struggle to survive. But the situations are just so silly. It is like a light-hearted version of ""Centennial""...",Jeremiah Johnson
7,lee_eisenberg,Well-done (although I would never want to be a mountain man),10,9 December 2005,"In ""Jeremiah Johnson"", Robert Redford plays the mountain man title character. Disenchanted with how the United States is turning out, he moves to the Rocky Mountains, expecting to live in peace, but everything takes an unfortunate turn.Usually, mountain man stories seem silly, but director Sydney Pollack does it right here. Similarly, Robert Redford would straighten out a previously clichéd idea when he directed ""The Milagro Beanfield War"" sixteen years later. But overall, I have to admit that I could never be a mountain man; I'm spoiled by city life. But no matter, this is a movie for everyone.",Jeremiah Johnson
8,ccthemovieman-1,"Rugged Mountains, Rugged Man",8,10 July 2006,"This was just a simple tale of a ""mountain man"" and his life over a period of time surviving in the Rocky Mountains. The time period is the first half of the 19th century. Robert Redford plays ""Jeremiah Johnson.""The film shows Johnson's battles with the Crow Indians, his family life after he is ""stuck"" with an Indian bride and a young boy and some of the tragedies that befall all of them, as well as a few other people.Will Geer, a wonderful Native American actor, gets good billing in here but is only in the last 20 minutes! He also has no dialog. This is mainly a one-man show with Redford, and that's okay. He's usually interesting and he's always in beautiful movies, photography-wise.The scenery - filmed in Utah - is great stuff and looks awesome on widescreen DVD. It really needs to be seen in that format to be fully appreciated.",Jeremiah Johnson
9,rmax304823,Not Your Generic Western.,7,28 November 2008,"A man gives up civilization in the 1840s and heads for the Rocky Mountains with the intention of living the life of a lone hunter and trapper.What an unpromising premise. It can so easily get boring, seeing one guy trying to cope with the vicissitudes of a majestic but harsh and unforgiving environment, and occasional brief encounters with other humans, half of them determined to kill him. (All but two of the other half are indifferent.) I couldn't do it.A story like this can so easily go wrong, as it did in ""Castaway"", for instance. But with the help of the extraordinarily popular and handsome Robert Redford, the movie makers manage to pull it off. There's hardly a dull moment.Nothing comes off quite as expected. At first, Redford knows nothing about survival in the wilderness. Finally he is taken in for a short spell by an old grizzly hunter, Will Geer, from whom he learns the rudiments of getting along from one day to the next.The movie of course depends on Redford. Despite his personal attraction to the mountains of Utah, it seems like a poor choice because he's a minimalist actor, releasing whole gigabytes of information with a roll of his eyes. And the director, Sidney Pollack, a master of urban Angst, expects us to become involved with this guy? But Redford's cool actually makes the film more interesting in that, through his very reticence, he introduces an element of simultaneous contrast with the events going on around him. He proves to be a good physical actor, but he's almost a hole in the story, being to the movie as a whole, what the pupil is to an attractive eyeball.Redford is no hero here, mostly just an ordinary neurotic who's trying to forget the (Mexican-American) war. Most of the time his handsome features are hidden by a full beard. There are only two expectable genre conventions. One is that he keeps killing Crow Indians as they attack him one by one and, though often wounded, he's always the victor. The second is that he mistakenly enters into a marriage with a Flathead (or Salish) woman and is forced by circumstance to adopt a mute white boy. There is the simulacrum of a family then. After they get to know one another a bit, they play field hockey together. (Ho hum, says the savvy viewer.) But they're lost to him because he chooses to aid some stranded white folks, so he's left on his own again. The ending is ambiguous. It's not clear how Redford turns out. If he survives the continuous Crow attacks, he might well end up as savage and bitter as the animals he kills. A different, and equally realistic description of the life of a trapper, can be found in A. B. Guthrie's ""The Big Sky"" -- the novel, not the movie. There's a surprising amount of humor. Well -- ANY humor in the story of a man traipsing by himself through the wilderness is liable to be surprising. But, really, running across a guy buried to his neck in the soil? Claiming he is still sitting on his buried horse? Pollack, thank God, doesn't really go in for the easy shots. Aside from hiding Redford's features, the director manages to avoid having him strip off his shirt to take a swim. (Imagine Sylvester Stallone in the part.) Redford and his non-English-speaking wife have a friendly but sharp exchange, like the Flintstones. After lengthy periods of isolation, when a friend shows up in the distance, they don't greet each other warmly. They don't greet each other at all. Neither do they say good-bye. When they decide to split up, one says, ""I think I'll go to Canada."" The other says, ""Keep your hair,"" and rides off shouting gibberish to himself. The Indians are treated fairly. After Redford has just slaughtered four or five of the Crow who have murdered his family, he corners the last one, who begins singing his death song. Redford crouches over him with his knife, eyes darting around, then shuffles off without killing him. There are some fights but they're realistic -- mano a mano, and short. Nobody dangles from a cliff, let alone from a skyscraper. We don't see two bodies struggling under the water. None of the violence is in fashionable slow motion. Pollack exercises a good deal of restraint.There seems also to be a good deal of social comment -- on human nature, on the Vietnam war -- but there's not enough space to get into it. And I'm not sure I could interpret it all that accurately.Worth seeing.",Jeremiah Johnson
10,ma-cortes,Chronicle of life of an adventurer with great sense of humanness and good feeling,8,27 July 2011,"This extraordinary Western results to be a slice of life about a hermit man and a hostile environment .The picture narrates the odyssey of an adventurer that one time dreary of civilization goes to Rocky Mountains becoming into mountain man , a young who is part of the wildlife of the landscape.He early develops his senses from his first feeble and failed attempts at survival to an expert hunter who shoots efficiently his preys and turning into an exciting new myth , the great Jeremiah Johnson . When he trespasses holy land is continuously pursued by Indians and vice versa, because he seeks vengeance , going on a relentless chase. Meanwhile the Indians attack his farm. Crow Indians set out to track down the mountain man on savage raids until an inconclusive final .Solid western with interesting events , violent fights , emotions , thrills and spectacular outdoors . From the initiation until the final are proceeded continuous battles against nature and a survival fighting versus wintry wilderness , enemy trappers and savage Indians, among others . The story is a crossover of various films, the battle against nature of ¨Man of a wilderness land¨ and Indians as ¨ Man called horse ¨ and the obstinacy and stubbornness of relentless enemies who fight with no rest such as ¨The duelists¨. The magnificent cast is starred by an excellent Robert Redford , a simple man who has no taste for cities and becomes a tough and two fisted mountain man obsessed a bloody revenge . Supporting cast is featured by various actors in brief performances as Jack Colvin , Matt Clark , Charles Tyner and special mention to Will Geer as feisty old trapper . Splendid cinematography in Panavision and glimmer Technicolor by Duke Callagham as is reflected on spectacular outdoors filmed in sighting, rousing natural parks from Rocky Mountains. Lively and evocative musical score by usual secondary actor John Rubinstein and beautiful songs by also actor Tim McIntire . The motion picture is stunningly directed by the recently deceased Sidney Pollack (Yazuka, Three days of the condor, Way we were, Out of Africa). Rating : Better than average . This outstanding film will appeal to Robert Redford fans and landscape lovers .",Jeremiah Johnson
11,hitchcockthelegend,The Rocky Mountains are the marrow of the World.,8,3 June 2011,"Jeremiah Johnson is directed by Sydney Pollack and is inspired by two books, Raymond Thorp and Robert Bunker's Crow Killer: The Saga of Liver-Eating Johnson and Vardis Fisher's Mountain Man. Script was written by John Millius and Edward Anhalt and cinematography is by Duke Callaghan. It stars Robert Redford, Will Geer, Stefan Gierasch, Delle Bolton and Josh Albee.Hardened after the war with Mexico, and fed up with everyday life, American Jeremiah Johnson (Redford) leaves civilisation behind to live life as a mountain man. He intends to be self-sufficient as a trapper, but he finds that mother nature can be tough, and out here in the mountain wilderness he is not alone. There are others here, and Jeremiah must face many challenges if he is to truly survive.Filmed entirely on location in the vast wilderness beauty of Utah, Jeremiah Johnson is light on plot but all the better for it. Film basically constitutes Redford's mountain man learning to survive up in them thar mountains, and, earning the right to do so. A number of issues will arise to test his metal, giving him a number of hardships and adventures to define his transformation from average Joe to a fully fledged mythical man of the Earth. Redford is wonderfully at ease in the title role, and very quickly he gets the audience on side to share in his journey. But ultimately it's the landscapes that you take away from this movie. Not only gorgeous, but also the critical character that frames Johnson during his isolation and battle for survival. 8/10",Jeremiah Johnson
12,Theo Robertson,"Poor Editing , Not Enough Decent Dialogue",4,29 August 2005,"I got a massive fright when I saw this because I misheard some of the early dialogue when someone says to the title character - "" You just came to molest my hunt "" which had me thinking the title of the movie should have been BILL CLINTON and not JEREMIAH JOHNSON , but I do assure you I did realise within seconds what the actual line was This is a movie that's let down by a lack of dialogue since much of the narrative involves a lone character who has no one to bounce lines off , that's why a lot of books like Richard Matheson's I AM LEGEND are somewhat unfilmable because many pages are devoted to a character living alone with thought process informing the reader as to what they're thinking It's also a very poorly edited movie where we see wild wolves attack Johnson which is both confusing and laughable . A jump cut leads to a wolf biting Johnson's hand then another jump cut to the wolf biting his leg . It's also obvious that the "" attack "" is done by filming a real wolf jumping then cutting to someone throwing a cuddly stuffed wolf at Redford ! There's also a very confusing scene involving Johnson fighting an Indian where he falls in a river , cut to a mountain range then a log cabin where Johnson kills and Indian in a fight . Is it the same fight ? the same Indian ? You tell me The real Jeremiah Johnson was a rabid Indian hater involved in a blood feud with Indians but this movie seems produced to appeal to a PG audience hence the story has been toned down which might have ruined the potential somewhat if the haphazard editing and production values hadn't done so",Jeremiah Johnson
13,Hey_Sweden,A man of proper wit and adventurous spirit.,8,28 July 2015,"Jeremiah Johnson (Robert Redford) is disillusioned with life after experiencing the horrors of the Mexican War. Now his one simple desire is to live the life of a ""mountain man"". He will fend for himself, and live off the land. Along the way he will encounter such characters as the helpful old hermit Bear Claw (Will Geer), the grieving ""crazy"" woman (Allyn Ann McLerie), and the flamboyant Del Gue (Stefan Gierasch). He will incur the wrath of the Crow tribe, becoming a marked man, and meet many of their number in hand to hand combat. He will also experience friendship, love, and loss, while once again finding his place in the world.Redford is aces in this well crafted story inspired by a real life trapper named John Johnston, and drawn from sources such as the novel ""Mountain Man"" by Vardis Fisher and the tale ""Crow Killer"" by Raymond W. Thorp & Robert Bunker. Given that one of the two credited screenwriters is John Milius (the other being Edward Anhalt), this proves to be a stirring, robust, and interesting entertainment. It's extremely well directed by Sydney Pollack, and it's set against the backdrop of some truly breathtaking wilderness. Themes of man vs. man and man vs. nature are front and centre. Some viewers may take exception to the way in which a number of the Indian characters are portrayed, but balancing that is the appealing performance of Delle Bolton (who gets an ""introducing"" credit) as the Indian lass Swan, whom Jeremiah is roped into taking as a wife.Our hero definitely blossoms as he forms something resembling a family unit, with a ""son"" whom he christens Caleb (Josh Albee), and his new bride. His story is somewhat episodic in nature, but compelling and heartfelt.The music is credited to actors Tim McIntire and John Rubinstein, and it is simply beautiful, serving as the perfect accompaniment to lovely widescreen images captured by cinematographer Duke Callaghan.Redford is extremely well supported by a cast that also includes character actors Joaquin Martinez, Paul Benedict, Charles Tyner, Jack Colvin, and Matt Clark. Both Geer and Gierasch steal the show in their respective scenes.Redford has made many fine films, but this one remains somewhat undervalued.Eight out of 10.",Jeremiah Johnson
14,LeonLouisRicci,Clumsy and Clichéd,6,16 March 2013,"Although his heart was in the right place, let's face it, Robert Redford is totally miscast as this bitter, rugged mountain man. Placed on the beautifully shot landscapes he just seems out of place with his beautifully layered hair.This quiet Western Adventure is probably better because of its sparse use of dialog because what is used is quite Hollywood corn and mostly rings phony, like most of the characters in this overrated Movie.Clichés abound as the folksy ballad intrudes unnecessarily at times, as if we needed to be reminded that we are watching a Movie. That is undeniable. It is not as bad as Dances With Wolves (1990) and can be viewed for some enjoyment, but for a Film striving for realism it oh so fails as it tries to portray isolation and individualism.It is disjointed and edited rather clumsily and there is unintentional humor and the intentional humor falls flat. Even the dirty faces and scraggly beards look like make-up. This is an experience that many find warm and memorable. It's reputation is solid and if you don't mind all that has been said here, you may enjoy it. But it is much more of gallant failed attempt than great insight into the elusive Mountain Man Mythology.",Jeremiah Johnson

He is looking for solitude and a place to settle. Turns out finding a place and keeping it is more difficult than he expected.Directed by Sydney Pollack, a decent story of adventure, survival and adaptation. Very interesting and engaging, especially in the initial stages. Does start to drift from a point though and then never finds a focus after that.

16,Uriah43,A Man Seeking Solitude Out West,9,14 October 2018,"Having served in the American army during the Mexican War, a loner by the name of ""Jeremiah Johnson"" (Robert Redford) decides to become a mountain man and heads into the Rockies to hunt, fish and trap. At first he finds his new vocation to be extremely difficult but, as luck would have it, he meets another mountain man named ""Bear Claw"" (Will Gear) who teaches him some fundamental lessons which help him make it on his own. Yet, even though he desperately wants to live a solitary life, he inevitably meets other people who enrich his life but at the same time cause him great pain and sorrow. And it's the interaction with these people that, coupled with the harsh wilderness environment, makes this film so compelling. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this is clearly one of the better Western films made during this particular period of time in American cinematography due in large part to the gritty realism displayed and the fine performances of all of the actors involved. That being said, I definitely recommend it to all viewers.",Jeremiah Johnson
17,AaronCapenBanner,Escape From Humanity.,7,17 September 2013,"Robert Redford plays Jeremiah Johnson in director Sydney Pollock's interesting, beautifully filmed story of how Johnson, soured by human civilization, flees into the Colorado Rocky Mountains, where he barely survives that first winter, but he is aided by an experienced old trapper(played by Will Geer) who teaches him what he knows, and is gradually impressed by how quickly he learns, eventually becoming an experienced mountain man himself. Later, he will find himself at odds with the local native American tribe, who have attacked his home after he transgressed on their ancient tribal burial ground.Fine acting by all, with an engrossing story that may well have influenced the(kinder and gentler) film ""The Life And Times Of Grizzly Adams"" and subsequent TV series with Dan Haggerty. Johnson is not always an endearing person like Adams was, since his stubborn personality may well have alienated him from his fellow man(I sympathize!) Still, this fine film is quite worthwhile, and has a haunting ending.",Jeremiah Johnson
18,Wuchakk,"The ""Dances With Wolves"" of the 70s",7,24 November 2012,"Well, sort of.Like ""Dances With Wolves,"" ""Jeremiah Johnson"" (1972) is about a white man choosing to live in the wilderness and his inevitable interactions with natives. Like ""Dances,"" it features realistic natives and was a hit at the box office. Unlike ""Dances,"" the story takes place in the mountains, rather than the prairie, and it's less compelling.THE PLOT: Jeremiah Johnson decides to leave civilization behind to become a mountain man in the Rockies. At first he's a bit naïve to the ways of the high country but he learns and eventually acquires a kid and a native wife. Although he befriends some natives, he develops hostilities with the Crow. Johnson proves himself in combat and develops an almost legendary status while braves keep coming after him to win a name for themselves.The film was based on the true story of Liver-Eating Johnson who notoriously ate the liver of the braves he killed because the Crow believed the liver was vital for the afterlife. He was also known as Crow Killer and killed braves for 25 years, attaining legendary status, but finally made peace with the tribe.Some people complain about Robert Redford in the title role, suggesting that he was too much of a handsome movie star, but who says all mountain men were brawny and ugly? It is true, however, that the real Johnson was 6'2"" and 260 lbs, while Redford is 5'9"" and fairly lean. Even though Charleton Heston would've been better in the role, Redford does fine.Although the stomping grounds of the real Johnson was Montana and N. Wyoming, the film was shot in Utah, which sometimes has too much of a Southwest flair to be a good substitute. Regardless, the locations are spectacular. Some even point out that the movie is worth owning just for the location photography.The film was directed by Sydney Pollack and adopted by John Milius from the book ""Mountain Men"" and the story ""Crow Killer."" It runs 116 minutes.FINAL WORD: It's interesting to watch this film and observe Native Americans being portrayed realistically and respectfully almost two decades before the heralded ""Dances With Wolves."" ""Jeremiah Johnson"" may not be great like ""Dances"" but it's quite good, as long as you're in the mood for an atypical Western that's kind of low key and doesn't spell everything out. If you're looking for cowboys, saloon gunfights and cavalry, forget it.GRADE: B",Jeremiah Johnson
19,christopher-underwood,just about watchable,5,8 December 2018,"I'm sure this film was hellish to make in the situations and conditions it takes place and at the very least it does therefore look good at all times. Trouble, however, is there at the very start with that three minute 'overture' with still picture. Pretentious or what? For a slow film with little story or dialogue this is surely the worst of all possible beginnings. And it doesn't get all that much better. Perhaps if everyone could have been flown back to some cosy studio where the dailies could have been watched there might have been better material for crucial scenes where far more effective editing than we see here might have been possible. Most of the fights and animal conflicts are hampered by what looks like incompetence but is more likely lack of material. Fortunately the film is not as long as it seems so for those interested is just about watchable.",Jeremiah Johnson
20,whpratt1,Fantastic Redford Classic,8,21 January 2007,"This film I had never seen until recently and I sure was glad to have viewed this film on TV. The photography is outstanding in the West with the Rocky Mountains and the real wide open spaces for miles and miles. Robert Redford, (Jeremiah Johnson) was in the Civil War and decided he was going to get away from and become an adventurer (Hermit) in the high country and in parts of this unknown territory known mostly by various Indian tribes. As you view this film you see that Jeremiah was rather green at trying to survive and being able to accomplish simple things like catching fish and wild game. Jeremiah does meet up with some friendly characters who give him some hints about really being able to survive in this rough and tough country. Jeremiah soon gathers quite a few people to help him settle down in the mountains with a nice log cabin and a boy, Josh Albie,(Caleb) who never speaks a word along with Delle Balton, (Swan) a very young Indian woman who speaks very little English and was taught to be religious from a Catholic Missionery. This is a great family film and is a great masterpiece from 1972.",Jeremiah Johnson
21,DKosty123,Scenic Rough Character In Rougher Frontier,8,8 September 2016,"The Scenery Director Sydney Pollack frames in this film is unbeatable. The story, taken from the novel is treated well. Redford is at his best in this one. He carries the central role of Johnson with pride and grit. Will Geer, veteran character actor best known as Grandpa Walton excels in support as Bear Claw, the mentor who is Johnsons first encounter when he decides to become a mountain man at the top of the film. Bear Claw is an old rough and tumble bear hunter whose necklace of bear teeth chronicle his many encounters.The story is about a rugged frontiersman life in the era of the west when there were still plenty of Native Americans in an untamed West. A lot of the filming is done on location in Utah, among other places. It is visually stunning and the story does hold up well.This movie is for more than Reford fans, though thankfully it shows us a Redford rarely seen in his career.",Jeremiah Johnson
22,sddavis63,Largely Meaningless,3,4 May 2010,"The great strength of this movie is its setting. It's beautifully filmed and features spectacular scenery that does manage to give the viewer a sense of being in the wilderness with Jeremiah. Unfortunately, spectacular scenery aside, the great weakness of this movie is its story. It really doesn't seem to have any particular point to it and it really doesn't lead up to anything. There are a few good scenes in it. When Bear Claw (Will Geer) gets the grizzly to chase him into the cabin for Jeremiah to skin him I smiled; the fight against the wolves was pretty good; and there really was a sense of sympathy when Jeremiah discovered his ""family"" massacred. But there really didn't seem to be much glue holding this together as a comprehensible story.Jeremiah (Robert Redford) is a mysterious figure. As the movie opens he simply appears, getting off a boat in the western wilderness and striking off to be a mountain man. There's no real explanation of the character - where he came from, what he was getting away from, why he chose the mountains. There's a couple of hints that he had been a soldier (he's wearing army pants as the movie opens, and he makes reference to the war against Mexico in another scene) so perhaps he's a deserter? Or just disillusioned by war? In the era in which the movie was made, perhaps that would make him something of a sympathetic character (in the early 70's lots of people were ""dropping out"" of society, disillusioned by war.) But that's speculation on my part; Jeremiah's background was never really explored, and so never really explained.The setting alone gives this a certain attraction - as does the fact that Jeremiah is escaping from the world (who hasn't wanted to do that at one point or another?) But as far as story or plot goes, this struck me as largely meaningless.",Jeremiah Johnson
23,Lejink,Cold beauty,8,16 August 2009,"Another favourite film of my dad's and as ever, the old man's rarely wrong. One thing I always liked about Robert Redford was that he didn't sell out his integrity for a cheap blockbuster big-payday, unlike say Newman and McQueen in ""The Towering Inferno"". That said this movie belongs along with the likes of the former's ""Buffalo Bill and The Indians"" and the latter's ""Tom Horn"" as an example of film-making for film-making's sake and is all the better for its artistic integrity.Here, pretty-boy Redford is deglamourised to the extent that for most of the film he's heavily be-whiskered and if he seems less like a grizzled mountain-man than one might have wished (the originally cast Clint Eastwood raising intriguing possibilities), nevertheless in a difficult eponymous role, requiring lots of physical exertion and correspondingly little verbal expression, Redford convinces you of his character's veracity from the off and holds the viewer's attention all the way through.Along the way of course, he encounters a few eccentric characters, which adds to the richness of the narrative and is teamed up for a long time, until their bloody demise at the hands of the avenging Black Crow Indians, an almost mute pair of companions, one a Flat-head Indian squaw to whom he's affianced in near enough a shotgun-wedding and the morose young son of another victim of the Black Crow whom he takes in.The film thus, especially in the first half, moves along in near silence, at its own pace and invites the viewer to get to know this individual character, get under his skin as it were and moreover take in the fantastic snow-covered mountain scenery he inhabits. I had absolutely no problem with this, finding much to admire in director Pollack's beautifully shot cinematography as well as the quality of the acting. An actor's hardest task, it seems to me, is to convey emotion without words and this Redford does superbly throughout especially in the heart-breaking scene when he comes upon his slain adopted family.Despite his orneriness, Johnson does build up a series of interesting relationships with a variety of differing personalities he meets along the way, the last of these being the hard-won respect of his nemesis, the Black Crow leader he encounters throughout the movie. The film also subtly proffers a pacifist message which I would imagine was not quite on-side with the prevalent US Government of the day.Okay, I could have done without the mediocre folk-balladry which regularly interspersed the action and would counsel patience to potential viewers as the movie finds its feet, but can state that those that do will be rewarded with a brave, uncommercial work offering an insight into a long-vanished arcane world peopled with real characters in a time and place far removed from the comfort-zone of this particular city-dweller.",Jeremiah Johnson
24,vincentlynch-moonoi,Rokbert Redford's masterpiece,8,14 July 2015,"I'm tempted to call this Robert Redford's masterpiece.Positives: 1. A remarkably good performance by Robert Redford, who back at this time had decided on a path to acting excellence. 2. An equally remarkable performance by Will Geer as a gnarly old mountain man. 3. On-location photography that is nothing short of stunning. 4. It doesn't glorify the life of a mountain man, just exemplifies it.Negatives: I can't really think of any,This is not the same kind of film that ""Dancing With Wolves"" was, because it doesn't have the joy that film has. Yet, it is every bit as much an epic film. Highly recommended.",Jeremiah Johnson
25,sol-,Dropping out of society,7,6 March 2016,"Disillusioned by the horrors of war, a US soldier attempts to live alone in the mountains in this unusual western starring Robert Redford. The film is based on the true story of an 1840s fur trapper, however, the basic narrative has more in common with the 'dropping out of society' movies of circa 1970 with Redford rejecting the rules of the society that has raised him, only to have to contend with other (Amerindian) rules. Perhaps most pointedly though, Redford finds himself eventually saddled with all the accoutrements of society that he has tried to avoid, inadvertently making friends, given a surrogate son (after the boy's family is killed) and an Amerindian bride for a wife. One of the film's best aspects is how Redford gradually progresses from being resentful of the son and wife to actually caring deeply enough about them to take action at a pivotal point. Intelligent as all this might sound, 'Jeremiah Johnson' is certainly not a film for all tastes. It is very deliberately, almost lethargically paced and Redford's journeys are accompanied by a series of superfluous sentimental songs. The film also never really probes into Redford's past and all the reasons that culminated in his drop out of society. It is, however, his journey (rather than his motivation) that drives the film. He might look and sound the same by the end of the film, but he is indelibly changed. No matter how one dissects it, it is hard to deny that the film has a potent message to offer about the difficulty of actually avoiding society and the company of others altogether. The scenery is great too.",Jeremiah Johnson
26,poe426,Hand to mouth...,10,2 July 2014,"The finest westerns, it seems to me, are the least conventional ones- movies like BAD COMPANY, with Jeff Bridges, for instance, which takes the stylized romance of the Fred Remington-esque westerns of the early 20th century and gives it a good, swift kick in the seat of the pants. As did McCABE & MRS. MILLER (whose look and feel may well have inspired the teleseries DEADWOOD, to some degree); and CHARLEY ONE-EYE (which co-starred Richard Roundtree and Roy Thinnes); and THE BALLAD OF GREGORIO CORTEZ (with Edward James Olmos); and THE GREAT NORTHFIELD, MINNESOTA RAID (with Robert Duvall); and WILL PENNY (starring Charlton Heston), etc. Redford is credible as Johnson and his interactions with the locals are often riveting. ""Friend or foe...?"" Will Geer (who played Grandpa Walton on THE WALTONS) seemed born to play a Mountain Man, and his is one of the more memorable parts: he takes things in stride, with a barely-concealed sense of humor, but understands all too well the hardships of life in the mountains and has a wistful air about him when last he lays eyes on JEREMIAH JOHNSON. Giersach is likewise a character never to be forgotten- but it's the solitary struggle of Johnson- who ""was bettin' on forgettin'""- as rendered by Redford who is most memorable of all.",Jeremiah Johnson

29,thinker1691,""" You've done well to Keep your hair, when so many's after it """,8,21 August 2007,"There are many films which personify the era of the Mountain Man. This is perhaps one of the best. The reason why it is at the top of the list, is due in part to director Sydney Pollack's selection of natural wonders, majestic scenery and simplistic storyline. The movie tells the story of Jeremiah Johnson (Robert Redford) a veteran of the Mexican American war who decides to journey into the High Alpine Rockies to become a Mountain Man. Based very loosely on the novel by Vardis Fisher, the hero seeks the life of a trapper which offers Solace, wild adventure, aboriginal encounters and a chance for legendary exploits. During the first years of his experience, Johnson is befriended and threatened by both Native Americans and crazed mountain veterans who teach him and endanger him as well. Among the best is 'Bear Claw, Chris Lapp' (Will Geer), 'Paints His Shirt Red' (Joaquin Martinez) and Del Gue (Stefan Gierasch). (Delle Bolton) plays Swan and Josh Albee) is Caleb who become part of an instant family. The film is quite picturesque in its beautiful seasonal settings and entertaining to anyone seeking a chapter in the bygone era of a vanished breed. ****",Jeremiah Johnson
30,MBunge,Wonderful scenery and a great working out of practical libertarianism,6,3 September 2010,"This film is a rueful paean to the legend of the Wild West mountain man. It celebrates his stoic glory but doesn't flinch from a harsh life that very few were fit for.Jeremiah Johnson (Robert Redford) is a man fresh out of the army who wants only to leave the world behind for the mountain wilderness of Colorado. He starts out as a real greenhorn, barely able to keep himself alive. Then he meets a grizzled old hunter of grizzly bears named Bear Claw (Will Geer), who takes Jeremiah in and teaches him how to survive. Leaving Bear Claw behind to make his own way, Jeremiah comes upon a family of settlers murdered by Indians. Only a mother driven mad by grief and a young boy survived. Jeremiah takes the boy into his care and then meets another mountain man named Del Gue (Stefan Gierasch), who pushes them into taking revenge on the Indians who slew the settlers. He also ends up getting Jeremiah married to a beautiful Indian girl named Swan (Delle Bolton). Jeremiah, Swan and the boy he names Caleb become a family, until Jeremiah is called upon to help settlers trapped in the mountains. That act of mercy has terrible consequences, leading to a cycle of revenge and death that make a legend of Jeremiah Johnson.The first thing you should know about this movie is that there's not much of a plot, in the sense of events connecting to other events and leading to a big climax. This story is more ""Guy goes into mountains. Stuff happens"". So, if you're looking for a fast-moving and clear narrative, you won't find it here.Aside from that, Jeremiah Johnson is a very enjoyable film. It's very much a ""scenery Western"" where the awesome beauty of the Rocky Mountains is as important to the story as any character. It makes a great setting for a screenplay that tries to say as much with silence as it does with dialog. Will Geer and Stefan Gierasch play colorful characters without making them into caricatures. Delle Bolton and Josh Albee don't let the fact that they never speak of word of English prevent them from expressing real emotion. Robert Redford has to carry the movie as a very unflashy and stoic man, but he manages to find the subtleties in someone who wants to make his own life away from the rest of the world.This movie also deserves praise for it's careful and balanced portrayal of the conflict between white settlers and Indian tribes. It doesn't shy away from the dangers Indians posed, but it frames their violent attacks in the context of a people whose land is being invaded by alien outsiders. The story feels no need to condemn or justify either side of the white/Indian conflict.Jeremiah Johnson is also film that everyone who's ever flirted with Libertarianism should probably see. It demonstrates the allure of the lone man freed from the burdens and responsibilities of society. It's also very clear on how ""you vs. the world"" can be a punishingly brutal life.This is a good movie that's held up quite well over time. You might need to have a little patience with it, but it will be worth the effort.",Jeremiah Johnson
31,iquine,Redford Tussles in the Mountains,4,9 February 2019,"(Flash Review)How does one end up with a young boy his mother pleaded to take and raise AND a Native American wife that he also got stuck into a forced marriage to? Robert Redford plays a man who now thrives in the Colorado northern woodlands hunting and trapping grizzly bears and buffalo as he had left his past behind and appears to be taking on the persona of a mythical figure. A family falls into his lap for part of his life but the film follows his life as he tries to survive while frequently tussling with the other native tribe. Overall this film is rather bland and repetitive with annoying to corny narration that is done in song. I guess if you want to see Redford as a mountain man then wait no longer. Get this, it clocks in at 1:48 and had an Intermission title card that lasts several minutes!! That'll truly show you how slow it mentally felt that the audience needed a breather. haha",Jeremiah Johnson

First, the scenery (and photography of it) was totally gorgeous. But I guess it's hard to go wrong with Zion National Park. And Robert Redford was a bit too much of a pretty boy back then to be totally convincing as Johnson. The incident early in the film with Redford trying to start a fire under a tree in the bitter cold, and just when it gets going it is snuffed out by snow falling from the tree, is right out of a Jack London story I read some decades ago. (I cannot recall the title.) I was very impressed with Delle Bolton who played the Indian maiden, Swan. But according to IMDb, this was the only film she ever appeared in. It was refreshing to see a film that did not try too hard to ennoble the Indians, and showed their savagery. Nowadays you would get something like ""Dances With Wolves"" where the camera is always somewhere else when the Indians begin to scalp and otherwise mutilate the dead. Overall, I enjoyed this film far more than I expected to. Grade: A",Jeremiah Johnson

34,slokes,Frontier Saga Drowsy But Authentic,5,14 May 2005,"""Jeremiah Johnson"" may only run two hours, yet the video version I have actually stops midway through for a musical entr'acte. It sort of feels right. In patience if not true time, this is one of the longest movies I ever sat through.Robert Redford is Jeremiah, a Mexican War veteran who has clearly had enough of civilization and wants to strike out for land where no white man has been. In the course of his travels, he meets a colorful grizzly-bear hunter (Will Geer), a scalp trader (Stefan Gierasch), a Flathead woman (Delle Bolton) and a boy (Josh Albee). None really are around very long, as Jeremiah's loneliness and individualism is pretty much the theme of the picture.A film that feels very much of its time, with a folksy singer playing a guitar while a camera pans over miles of snow-covered mountains, ""Jeremiah Johnson"" has a rugged authenticity that commands respect, without ever spilling over into Granola-hippie platitudes. With John Milius co-writing the screenplay, there's no chance the film will stoop at the conventional political pieties of its day (or ours). Indians massacre whites, whites shoot animals for fur, a sign over the door of a trading post says ""White men only,"" and no one questions why.But the problem with the film is that it is a trial to watch through its slow but meritable first half, then loses its bearings to become a different, quicker, but dumber movie, a revenge story with the once-peaceable Jeremiah becoming ""Crow-killer."" I understood the transformation, but it feels somehow wrong, with a series of sudden battles between JJ and individual Crow warriors (""Lucky they were Crow. Apache would have sent 50 at once,"" the scalp trader tells him) and a final scene so abrupt it appears the producers ran out of money.It's a one-man film, and Redford shows he can be interesting company. I'm not totally sold on his frontier authenticity, I know in real life the man is a big fan of the Great Outdoors, but he looks like Barry Gibb in buckskin with his big old beard. Still, he inhabits the small scenes well, like the one where he lights a fire or tries to teach his new Indian bride to say ""Yes"" or tries to take his legacy from the cold, dead hands of Hatchet Jack.At times a good film, at times a dull one, ""Jeremiah Johnson"" showcases the spirit of western migration. Actually, one of the things Westerners would say was the toughest thing to face was not the hard winters or Indian attacks, but the boredom. Maybe ""Jeremiah"" is too authentic that way.",Jeremiah Johnson
35,pc95,"Great Western for Redford, and Director Pollack",8,31 December 2010,"It's always a wonderful thing when you get to watch an older movie which brings it all together in a great way. That's what ""Jeremiah Johnson"" does. From the opening credits to the end of the movie, Sydney Pollack put together a movie that is one of Robert Redford's best. Though Redford's character doesn't have much dialog, indeed the photography of the American West is stunning. Redford's character's solitude and antagonizing confrontations with local Indian tribes are well enough, but the real power of the movie comes from the middle third where he builds his own family and learns of love and loss. I especially enjoyed that relationship with the forsaken boy and Indian Wife given the extreme environment. Highly recommended.",Jeremiah Johnson
36,Chase_Witherspoon,"He came, he saw, he conquered ...",5,30 October 2010,"Glorious cinematography of the Utah wilderness almost - but not quite - redeems this somewhat aimless tale of a man who shuns civilisation in favour of the wild, but finds himself initially incapable of survival, and then the subject of a bloody vendetta with local Indians. A different role for Redford, pitching his Ivy-League looks against the rigours of nature and blade of a tomahawk, but despite the engaging premise and delightful location work, there's little else to celebrate.His battles with the local Indian population just seem to be so spontaneous and unmotivated at times, that it's difficult to believe. Earning reprieves from short-sighted Indians who either miss with monotonous regularity, or fail to inflict a fatal wound, Jeremiah occasionally comes into contact with other frontier-men (Geer, Tyner, Gierasch, McLerie) for profound discourses on social attachment that would make Plato blush before resuming bloody hand-to-hand combat with the land's traditional owners. All this punctuated by ill-fitting country odes to Jeremiah.As we witness his bloody encounters and retributions spanning time and territory, his reputation for conquering the wild earns him legend status among new settlers, and his identity becomes one of folklore. The idea is appealing and there are aspects of this movie that work really well, but it's lacking the synergy required to be a great movie. A nice postcard and somewhat self indulgent of Redford's well known affection for Utah, despite all the promise, it's not enough to watch again.",Jeremiah Johnson

Anyway, I am not an expert on the context of this film. So this was primarily a man against nature film for me. Though I am sure there are many other themes in this film. Nothing is romanticized here. Life in the mountains is portrayed as tough, violent and dangerous.While I am not a big fan of his, Robert Redford was good enough as Jeremiah Johnson.There were parts of the films which were unbelievable - like the bit where Jeremiah singlehandedly kills a posse of Indians.The part where Jeremiah lives with an Indian woman (to whom he is forcefully married) and a small boy was interesting.

It's not an extremely complex story, but it doesn't have to be on account of the fact that its beautifully made. Robert Redford is flawless as the title character. The dialogue is perfect for the movie and it changes moods many times. Characters can be serious and comical and there are many instances of comic relief in the film, especially from characters like Del Gue and Bear Claw Chris Lapp. And then there's the wonderfully tranquil scenery shots of the breathtaking Rocky Mountains to bring back serenity to the film before moving on to the next big scene.I loved ""Jeremiah Johnson"" so much that after the first time I saw it, me and some friends decided to make our own movie.

However, the film is stolen from him by feisty bear hunter Will Geer and the eccentric, bald-headed Stefan Gierasch, as senior mountain men showing Johnson the ways of the wilderness.Interesting is it's depiction of Indians, in that it neither shows them as ""red"" savages or weak victims. At various times, they're portrayed as friendly, stern, and frightening.There's a lot of great detail in the muscular script co-written by John Milius and featuring many of his usual macho/romantic themes. One scene in particular (and one of my favorites) is reminiscent of his later work in Conan The Barbarian! Much like Conan, Jeremiah is on the verge of not making it in the wilderness when he receives a life-saving gift from a dead man. With Conan, it's his sword. Here, It's the gun Jeremiah Johnson uses to hunt his food and defend himself.The final act is fairly dark and a bit depressing, with little doubt that Johnson has changed a lot during the course of the movie.

But life in the wilderness is harsh and in more ways than Jeremiah may have thought.An exceptionally beautiful film to look at and with a captivating story, Jeremiah Johnson is a great film in most respects. Shot entirely in Utah, the scenery looks so great you almost wanna pack up your bags and head to the mountains before the credits end.It's also well written I think. Jeremiah goes through a lot and ends up with plenty of wisdom and experience but whether that's a good thing or not is up to viewers. Redford is excellent, doesn't talk all that much but conveys a lot through gestures and looks. Really good actor. Everybody else does good also, I particularly liked his wife and ""adopted"" boy.Plenty of action as well, as Jeremiah has quite a few brawls with some Indians.

This is the second of seven films that Robert Redford would star in for director Sidney Lumet which would include This Property Condemed, The Way We Were, Three Days of the Condor, The Electric Horseman, Out of Africa and Havana. John Milius adapted his screenplay principally from the novel Mountain Man by Vardis Fisher and segments of the book Crow Killer by Robert Bunker and Raymond Thorp. Jerimiah Johnson is the fictionalized account of an real life mountain man John Johnston whose life itself was more legend than fact. Johnston was born John Garrison who served in the Navy during the Mexican American War and deserted after striking an officer. He changed his name to John Johnston and worked in the west cutting wood for the riverboats. His wife was an Apsaroke, river Crow who was killed by a raiding war party of mountain Crow warriors. Johnston swore vengeance by dedicating his life to killing Crow warriors and in a symbol of completing the cycle of revenge he would allegedly eat part of their liver thus earning him the name Liver Eating Johnson (the t was dropped as mountain men passed his name around.) He somehow enlisted in the Union Army and late in his life became a deputy sheriff in Colorado and a the first town Marshall of Red Lodge, Montana where he served several terms before dying in Los Angeles at the age of 76. So is a brief outline of the real character but this film only uses part of the story (thankfully, Redford doesn't go around eating human livers) in a mythic western tale of man among the elements turning his back on society. In the cast is Will Geer in support but the rest of the cast are mostly unknown or lesser known character actors including Josh Albee, Delle Bolton, Stefan Gierasett, Allyn Ann McLerie, Charles Tyner and Joaquin Martinez. A good music score accompanies the beautiful scenic imagery in this interesting film that really has no ending. Even with a beard Redford might be too good looking to be an effective mountain man. Parts of this movie were filmed near Park City, Utah where Redford had bought the Timphaven Ski Resort and renamed it Sundance Resort. Soon after he would found his Sundance Film Festival there. I would give this an 7.5 out of 10.",Jeremiah Johnson

Considered a liberal-leaning movie in 1974, today I wonder how long before our modern Jacobins get this movie cancelled, as I lost count of the number of politically incorrect lines in the script. Outstanding performances from Redford, Will Geer, Stefan Gierasch, and Allyn McLerie, who doesn't say much but portrays the most convincing mad woman I've ever seen.

44,gab-14712,Successfully Explores the Mythology of the Mountain Man!,9,18 December 2018,"Movies like 1972's Jeremiah Johnson is why I love 70's cinema....and cinema in general. The movie is a contemplative, visceral work of art. I noticed many films from the 70's experimented with different ways of storytelling. Some movies, such as this particular film, does not focus too much on a strong narrative. This western relies upon imagery, music, and legendary mythos that defines the ""Mountain Man"" era. The movie requires patience because the story is told at a slow pace on purpose. I promise that you will be rewarded for your patience!The movie reunites director Sydney Pollack and star Robert Redford. In the span of their respective careers, they worked together nine times! This was their second feature after 1966's This Property Is Condemned. This movie originally paired Clint Eastwood and Sam Peckinpah, but the duo did not get along so they pursued other projects. Warner Brothers casted Redford in the lead role without anyone in the director's chair. Eager to work with Pollack again, Redford convinced him to sign on to the picture. The film is beautifully shot on location in the Utah mountains near Zion National Park and near Redford's home in Sundance (home to the famous film festival). After bad weather threatening to ruin production, Warner Brothers wanted to shoot the film in the studio's backlot. Pollack refused and dished out his own money in order to film the movie on location. The gorgeous scenery is part of why the film worked so well.The film was written by John Milius and adapted off two books, Crow Killer and Mountain Man: A Novel of Man and Female. The mythology of the ""mountain man"" always fascinated me and this movie tackles that mythology very well and might be the best one to do so, actually. In reality, Jeremiah Johnson was known as ""liver-eating Johnson"" due to his cannibalistic tendencies. However, Pollock scrapped that part out of the story and mainly focused on a story about a man's survival in the unforgiving wilderness.After serving the United States military in the Mexican War, Jeremiah Johnson (Robert Redford) decides to retreat from society into the Rocky Mountains wilderness. His idea was to live with nature in a world of peace and solitude, but it does not turn out entirely that way. He is taught survival methods under the guidance of bear trapper, Bear Claw (Will Geer). He encounters a community destroyed by an Indian raiding party and he adopts the only survivor's son Caleb (Josh Albee) and he is given a wife from the friendly Flathead Indians because he gave them the scalps of their enemies. Together, Jeremiah, Caleb, and Swan (Delle Bolton) live together in peace until the arrival of the United States Cavalry destroys the peace.One of things I like about 70's cinema is that movie stars are not necessarily important to make a high impactful movie. This movie has one star in Robert Redford and that was mostly it. Another reason why the film worked was because of Redford's amazing acting. He had the entire film on his back and not once did he let go. Any lesser actor would have affected the film's quality. Redford doesn't have much dialogue, but he really doesn't need to. It is his looks, his actions that do most of the speaking.Honestly, this film affected me in many ways. As a nature-loving person and as someone who explores the mythology of the mountain man, I wanted to become one for a split second. Living in the wild with the beauty of nature and away from society would be cleansing for the soul. Anyhow, Jeremiah Johnson is a wonder to behold. From the adventurous John Milius script, to the sure-handed direction of Sydney Pollack, the intense acting of Robert Redford, the picturesque cinematography from Duke Callaghan, the folksy music from Tim McIntire and John Rubenstein, this is an amazing film to say the least. It is a story told through imagery and it needs your patience! I will end the review on one more fun fact. This is the first Western to ever be in competition at Cannes Festival!My Grade: A",Jeremiah Johnson
45,rebeljenn,Failed to captivate,2,31 December 2005,"'Jeremiah Johnson' is the story of a fronteirsman who lives in the mountains and befalls some hard times with the Native Americans. Although the cinematography/photography is good and some excellent music, the film's plot was too slow for my liking. It's a very analytical story of the life of this man who lives in the mountains and his way of life, and it is a powerful film in that sense, but I failed to be captivated or really interested by this film. I also thought that it was too long to sit through, and the story and the character just did not interest me enough. Unless you have a big interest in this era of history or have heard about the film and think you may like it, then you might, but it is slow. I would compare it to films like 'Dances With Wolves', but it is not for everyone.",Jeremiah Johnson
46,RonellSowes,More Drudgery Than Serene,4,12 March 2021,"This film is based on the real life or legends of Jeremiah Johnson: a mountain man who's feud with the Crow led to a continuous series of one man show downs. Despite what the logline might say, this isn't really what happens in the film. The first hour or more, has nothing to do with his vendetta. It's more of an observation of the life of a mountain man-dreamily following his existence. Pollack tries so hard to make it serene that he turns it into utter drudgery. Nothing significant happens and what little does is hardly addressed. Even the action some how seems quiet as well as disjointed and rather unexplained. Pollack compared the picture it to a silent film, but even they have title cards to fill you in.
Jeremiah Johnson is a pondering film that tries to be something wholly different. Unfortunately, in striving to go places no film has, it goes where no film should.",Jeremiah Johnson

It was like stepping into a Bob Ross painting. Just a shame it had such a brutal storyline - but I guess that was a reflection of life back then.The score was my kind of music and helped carry the story nicely. I want some of that soundtrack! Robert Redford was at his understated best. For a film without much dialogue, it managed to capture so much emotion and keep me interested throughout. I just wanted to pack up life and go live in the mountains and rugged wilderness.""Jeremiah Johnson"" won't be everyone's cup of tea. Some elements don't fit within 2019's politically correct climate, but in a way, that's partly what makes this refreshing. It's escapism at it's brutal and tragic finest. The lack of dialogue and meandering pace might also alienate some viewers, but I found it oddly relaxing and captivating. The landscape was often all I needed.""Jeremiah Johnson"" is also perhaps one of the most manliest films ever made. For the first time in life, I almost felt macho - just for watching HahaKind of ""The Revenant"" meets ""Life Below Zero"" with an old western vibe thrown in for good measure.

50,khatcher-2,One of Redford's two or three best films,7,19 January 2003,"A film which is glibly categorized as a `western' but goes somewhat deeper than that. The Pollack/Redford combination works well, and the photography of those magnificent mountains of Utah is spectacular. With all that beautiful scenery in Montana, Nevada, Colorado, Utah, I am surprised that the US government never does very much for saving it and cleaning up all that contamination .. Thirty years on and after several viewings, I find this story grows on you, like the aging of fine wine in oak casks, such that another recent viewing gave me as much  if not more  pleasure. Precisely because it is not the standard `western' formula. One gets a little tired of John Wayne getting saddle-sore, killing indians and wooing women; at times watching `Jeremiah Johnson' I cannot help comparing a little with `Dances with Wolves' (qv), not because of any story similarity but more from certain situations being played out. Robert Redford has given us numerous films in which his characterization is pretty good in general, but in this film I rather fancy he was inspired, even to the point of throwing off that silly category so beloved of those suffering Hollywooditis. Most notable in `The Sting' (qv), `All the President's Men', `Out of Africa', and `A River Runs Through it', without forgetting his excellent directing of `Ordinary People', one of the best true-life dramas I have seen. `Jeremiah Johnson' is now one of the classics of the genre and even of cinema as a whole: always worth another viewing.",Jeremiah Johnson
51,Coffee_in_the_Clink,"""Where you heading?"" ... ""Same place you are, Jeremiah; Hell, in the end.""",7,30 September 2021,"""Jeremiah Johnson"" is a Western odyssey charting the experiences of a Civil War veteran who travels off the grid to escape civilisation and make it as a 'mountain man'. Along the way he picks up an orphan boy, the survivor of a massacre, and marries an Indian Chief's daughter. He builds a cabin and they settle down, but all of that is shattered when Jeremiah is dragged in to a tribal war with the Crows.Robert Redford is superb in this film, laid back and funny when he needs to be, and just as serious when that is warranted. The cinematography is excellent, as would be expected in a film shot in the wilderness. Will Geer as Bear Claw Chris and Sefan Gierasch as Del Gue make-up two of the best supporting performances as two characters who contribute to the film as much as the scenery. Without them, it wouldn't have been so good.I had no problem with the apparent lack of action or interest that many complain about, because as one person noted, this is a 'thinking' man's Western, and I greatly enjoyed it for that reason. Here we have a man battling the elements, Mother Nature herself, and succeeding, only to be brought back down by mankind in the form of tribalism. My only criticism of the film is the editing at times appears very choppy and could have been a lot smoother, this is clearly evident in some of the fighting sequences, when it is hard to make out what is after happening and who just hit who, etc.""Jeremiah Johnson"" stands out as a unique Western that will appeal to those fans looking to see a genre piece that is more primal than just the usual cowboys fighting in saloons and Union troops defending Fort Whatever from Apaches.",Jeremiah Johnson
52,jeremy3,The real west,9,23 March 2008,"For anyone who has ever spent time and gone hiking in a wilderness area, this is about as unpretentious movie as you can get. This beautifully photographed film shows how beautiful and rough life in the wilderness is. Some might consider this movie rather brutal and racist. The Native Americans were portrayed very roughly and the white man was seen as having to fight them for survival. However, I think that if you are getting too politically correct, you might miss a lot else to this movie. It was about how rough life truly is living in the mountains. Life for centuries before the Europeans came was rough and brutal. This movie actually is nice in-between of the overtly politically correct ""Dances With Wolves"" and the horribly sadistic and racist ""Mountain Men"" (a knockoff made later in the 70s with Charleston Heston). No one is portrayed too sensitively, because life was so rough in the mountains. Yet, there were great moments. For a time, Jeremiah Johnson finds himself happily married to a Native American woman and enjoying life. Then, tragedy of course strikes. The survivors of the mountains are stoic men, men of wisdom, and men who have learned a lot in life. This is the west that is forgotten. With all the beauty and romance of the Old West, it was also a very brutal and humbling life to all who experienced itself hardship, while seeking it's beauty and it's promises of freedom for the individual.",Jeremiah Johnson
53,Matthew_Capitano,"Atmospheric, though not without flaws",7,1 January 2013,"Sid Pollack's direction and Tim McIntire's atmospheric music are fine in this 'mountain man' movie and all the roles are cast rather well except for one -- the title character. Robert Redford has all the acting talent of a hollow log.The essence of the mountain man in this film (Johnson) is a spoiled putz. His opinions of the folks 'down below' are filled with contempt... ""It ought to have been different"", he says, and ""I've been to a town"" (and he doesn't ever want to go back to one). So this lame-o runs away from life to hide up in the hills so he can do important stuff like sleeping all day and using a piece of string to fish for whatever's in the river.Ultimately, this is a story which goes absolutely nowhere and that is evidenced by director Pollack's indecision on how to end the film as he continues pitching after the last inning had already been played.",Jeremiah Johnson
54,LaxFan94,One of Redford's many Native films.,7,21 January 2012,"I thought this one to be interesting in that it was one of Mr. Redford's many Native-themed films & documentaries. However Redford's love for Natives first appeared back in the late 60's when the resurgence of Native pride came in the form of the formation of AIM. I don't know HOW exactly he became interested from that alone but he did and surely enough, he wanted to make his presence felt for Native rights. For him, the best way to do that was to portray them in a positive light rather than the usual negative stereotypical ways that so many other white people have done. Mr. Redford has also produced interesting documentaries on Natives that have won different awards (I don't know which ones exactly offhand). But thanks to him, he has helped make a big difference on how mainstream Americans should see Native folks, and NOT how they're portrayed in those BS ones where Hollywood ruined it for them.Anyways ... this is why 'Jeremiah Johnson' is a 7 out of 10.",Jeremiah Johnson
55,imbluzclooby,Decent film loosely based on semi-legendary character,7,28 March 2010,"Jeremiah Johnson is a movie based on a malevolent and raucous character named Liver Eatin' Johnston who dropped out of society to hide out in the wilderness for a life of solitude. Unfortunately his supposed journey became more hectic and severe than he had planned. I read some reviews about the 2 books based on this character, ""Crow Killer"" and ""Mountain Man"". Many of the testimonies from his life are from third or fourth party members whose logic in reality and chronology are undoubtedly implausible. Many tall tales have been mentioned about Liver Eatin' Johnston leaving many historians incredulous. The few people who encountered him over his life speak of an extremely pernicious and rugged individual. The character portrayed by Robert Redford is a much toned down and soft version of this character.But putting aside tall tales and factual exaggerations, Jeremiah Johnson narrates the frontier saga of the lead character. The real character was only in his early twenties during the saga of which this film is supposed to take place. So Redford being about 35 is and looks a bit old for the role. But I will cast aside minor inaccuracies.This is a rather slow moving and deliberately paced film which is somewhat boring if you don't know what to look for. I'm hesitant to say this was a narcissistic engagement for Redford in that he milks this heroic and tough guy role for all it's worth. The problem is that Redford is not very believable. He's too sedate and sober in expression to reveal any angst or genuine rage. This character is supposed to be a mentally unbalanced maniac. But I know that the direction was intended to use Redford's star status and image (in his heyday) to capitalize on his popularity and slowly draw the audience into this man's world. Johnson nearly dies in the snow until he is saved and befriended by a cantankerous hillbilly (Will Geer) who teaches him the ways of the mountains. Oh, now this movie tries to get deep and postulate as if there is some wisdom that the flat landers are ignorant of. Mountains and nature can be harsh and one has to learn to adapt or else perish. And thus we are told the tale of Jeremiah Johnson and his life in the wilderness. I choose not to retell this worn out story, but I need to comment on the characters and actors and how this translates into creating people into stars:Redford is blonde and fair-skinned. He rose to popularity at a time when the Tall, Dark and Handsome look was overused. Redford arose to popularity in the early 70's and this movie is designed particularly for that purpose. Having his Aryan looks matched with a Native Blackfoot woman with broad cheekbones, full lips and chiseled features only gives him opportunity for bragging rights. Since the exotic appeal of an indigenous woman was new and somewhat taboo in that era, Redford capitalizes on this opportunity. It works yes. I was intrigued and even suspended to see any gratuitous sex. It is implied and not overtly revealed. Jeremiah is the leader of his new adopted family which he acquired reluctantly. This is another Hollywood attempt to make Redford look desirable by spurning dark, exotic woman and an orphan child. The boy, Caleb, is barely shown, but only with Redford to display Redford's integrity and humanitarian qualities. But his squaw, Swan, played by Delle Bolton has it made. She gets hitched to Johnson. He carries her across water, plains and snow. He cooks, hunts, and builds a cabin with his own hands. This is how Redford's ego is fed; it wants to show him in a strong and capable image without exposing his personal flaws. Pollack also shows this by making her look dumb, submissive and sexy. The overall treatment of Native Americans here is both racist and sexist.I personally never thought Redford was all that to look at. He's blonde and has a nice smile, but that's about it. I never cared for his features and I think this movie is a pure example of how Hollywood tried to deify and mythologize his persona to unreasonable proportions.",Jeremiah Johnson
56,comps-784-38265,Classic Film That 'The Revenant' Tried (and failed) to Emulate.,8,25 January 2016,"I recently saw 'The Revenant' with Leo DiCaprio and could not help but compare it to Jeremiah Johnson with Robert Redford.The comparison is not favourable. 'The Revenant' is not a patch on Jeremiah Johnson.Both are visually stunning. (Bear in mind that Jeremiah Johnson, circa 1972, is visually stunning without the benefit of CGI)Both have gritty realism.Both have very good acting.But only Jeremiah Johnson has a really really good story. Jeremiah Johnson, ex-soldier, tired of war goes up into the mountains to be a 'mountain man'. He has an exciting and dangerous life, learning how to survive, helped by an old mountain man. He finds survivors of Indian massacre and is force to adopt a mute boy. He then gets an Indian squaw as a present. He finally settles down with his new family. But comes back to find them killed by Indians. He tracks and kills all but one of the culprits. Thereafter the tribe, in a test of manhood, send warriors one at a time to try and kill him.

Just an incredible experience worth watching again and again. Never could figure out why Del Bolton disappeared after this movie. She is absolutely stunning but I really didnt notice myself until after I'd seen the movie for about the tenth time. Clearly the highlight of Redford's career and he is very credible as he eagerly learns the survival lessons of a mountainman from Will Geer, who obviously had fun with this part. Redford's metamorphosis as he moves from the hunter to the hunted is just amazing and the scene with Geer at the end of the film is one of the most poignant in movie history.

58,jckruize,Better with each viewing.,9,29 October 2001,"Redford's heart was clearly in this one. An actor who's often seemed ill-at-ease with his golden boy image, this role gives him the opportunity to play against type in the tale of a man who immerses himself in the wild in order to transform himself. His transition from greenhorn to mountain man is measured and convincing, aided by lively support from Will Geer and Stefan Gierasch, among others. Redford and his good friend and favorite collaborator, director Sydney Pollack, filmed in pristine, seldom-seen wilderness locations; this is definitely a movie to be enjoyed in a theater or letterboxed on DVD. Superb cinematography, sound and a flavorful score (by actors Tim McIntire and John Rubinstein) enhance the overall effect.

59,A-Ron-2,"A truly beautiful film, well worth viewing",7,18 August 2000,"Jeremiah Johnson is NOT a great narrative, instead it is a beautiful foray into the mind of the frontier.  Rather than simply tell a story about men who live precarious existences on the far-flung frontiers of human habitation, it tries to show us what those men were like.  This is not a perfect film, it has flaws... but it is a beautiful film and one that should be seen.
Perhaps Robert Redford was not the perfect choice to play Jeremiah, perhaps his soft good-looks do not complement what we would like to see in this semi-mythic character, perhaps he undermines just a tad of our credibility... but irregardless, he comes to embody Johnson.  I find his gradual transformation from inexperienced explorer into savage force of nature to be entirely beleivable, if perhaps a bit strained.Ultimately, the real problem lies in the film's narrative structure... it tends to meander too much and to never resolve itself in a meaningful manner.  The story turns violent, but we don't really get a sense of why this violence is significant, or germaine to the plot.  There are too many false endings, and the movie seems to end abruptly and without real closure.However, even with all of these problems in mind, Jeremiah Johnson is an experience. It may not be a film that you want to rent with a bunch of friends, but rather a film to watch by yourself, when you are in sort of a contemplative mood.  This is a film to relax to, to allow to happen rather than to actively engage it.  There are a lot of things to think about and to reflect on, and the film is truly beautiful to watch.  This may not be a film that you will watch often, but it is a film that you will value having watched.",Jeremiah Johnson

His struggles and where it takes him are the thread of the movie that shows you what it must have been like to contend with nature in such solitude and vastness.

It's much better for him if he doesn't have to get a job, wash everyday, or do something useful with his life. It's in the mountains where Johnson can be constructive, like when he sleeps all day, when he commits arson in the woods, and when he screams at the Rockies because he's tired of having to murder an Indian every half hour.Tediously directed by Sid Pollack, but just about every role was well-cast, except for Redford and Delle Bolten (Johnson's squaw, 'Swan').",Jeremiah Johnson
64,NORDIC-2,Western balderdash,7,30 June 2014,"New Jersey-born John Garrison, a.k.a., John Johns(t)on (c.1824–1900) joined the Union Army in St. Louis, Missouri in 1864 and served with Company H, 2nd Colorado Cavalry. Honorably discharged in 1865, Johnson migrated further west and became a notoriously tough and ruthless trapper, Indian fighter, and lawman. In the 1880s he served as Deputy Sheriff in Coulson, Montana and later became Town Marshall in Red Lodge, Montana. He died of old age at a veteran's home in Los Angeles. Such are the rather prosaic facts of the real John Johnson. Then there is the myth. An associate of Wild Bill Hickock named Joseph (John) ""White Eye"" Anderson (1853–1946) seems to be the main source for the fantastic legends that accrued around Johnson in the second half of the 20th century. In 1941 Anderson regaled western writer Raymond W. Thorp with tall tales of ""Crow Killer"" or ""Liver Eating Johnson,"" so named because Johnson allegedly slew between 300 and 400 (!) Crow warriors and ate their livers, raw, to avenge the murder of his pregnant wife in 1847 by a Crow hunting party—20 years before John Johnson moved West. Seventeen years after meeting Anderson, Raymond Thorp joined Robert Manson Bunker in writing 'Crow Killer: The Saga of Liver-Eating Johnson' (Indiana UP, 1958), a highly speculative ""biography"" that turned Anderson's wild fabrications into uncorroborated ""fact."" Noted western author Vardis Fisher further burnished the Johnson legend with his novel, 'Mountain Man' (Morrow, 1965). Building myth upon myths, screenwriter John Milius ('The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean') used Crow Killer and Mountain Man as his sources for Jeremiah Johnson, a movie that more realistically chooses to portray Johnson (Robert Redford) as a ascetic, romantic loner, not the vengeful, brutal monster recounted by White Eye Anderson. (Rather than waging a vendetta on the Crow, Redford's Johnson is constantly attacked by them.) Further enhancing Jeremiah Johnson's nobility and the film's lyricism are breathtaking vistas of the rugged Utah Rockies shot by Duke Callaghan (promoted to DP after serving as one of Sydney Pollack's cameramen on his previous film, 'They Shoot Horses, Don't They?'). If that were not enough, a lush musical score by John Rubenstein and Tim McIntire completes the picture. Yet, when the movie premiered at the 26th Cannes Film Festival on May 4, 1972, Robert Redford somewhat disingenuously told 'New York Times' interviewer Cynthia Grenier: ""I wanted this film to be an antidote to the general feeling in the States today that getting away from civilization is such a terrific thing and is so romantic. I wanted to show the kids what it is really like going it on your own in the wilderness..."" 'Jeremiah Johnson' might well have been the gritty western that Redford imagined it to be if producer Joe Wizan had gone with Clint Eastwood as Johnson and Sam Peckinpah as director, as was originally planned. The estimable (and once-blacklisted) Will Geer (best known as Grandpa on ""The Waltons"") plays Johnson's wilderness survival mentor, Bear Claw Chris Lapp. VHS (1997)and DVD (1997).",Jeremiah Johnson
65,ringfire211,Some nice scenery aside... seriously... can it get any duller??,2,15 December 2011,"Dull as dish water. No wait. Duller. I was so utterly bored that I started studying the patterns on my ceiling - which doesn't have any patterns. Damn!! I dunno... maybe one needs to be comatose to enjoy this thing. Unfortunately I'm a guy who yearns for a little excitement every now and then. The truth of the matter is that I really wanted to like this film. The theme of man going into nature I found appealing - I really loved INTO THE WILD (one of my favorite films from 2007) - but here I was just bored witless. Sure the on-location shooting in Utah was nice - loved the snow, the mountains, the valleys, the desert, etc. Redford was okay although I always saw him as more of a movie star than an actor in every role he played. I actually thought that Will Geer and Stefan Gierasch gave the more memorable performances here. But all this is a moot point because the whole affair is so dreadfully dull and pointless. Man meets some good Indians, man meets some bad Indians, man marries a good Indian, man wanders around the solitary landscape, man builds a house, bad Indians destroy said house, man wanders some more, etc. And all done with minimum dialogue. For large swathes of this film you feel like you're watching a silent movie. And none of what I saw I could engage in. I just flat out didn't care. I remember in the past thinking DANCES WITH WOLVES was boring but compared to this WOLVES is an outright adrenaline rush! Sydney Pollock really divides me - at times he can create very good stuff like THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR and THE YAKUZA and at other times he gives me coma-inducing stuff like this and OUT OF Africa.

But alas, the stereotypical nature of the characters kept him from appreciating the film.  Hopefully the poor fellow learned a bit more about the frontier and film theory as time went on and realized the beauty of this film.  Sydney Pollack's framing and editing is fantastic.  The story communicates both the ethos of the ""mountain man"", and the American concept of the frontier in its totality.  While the characters show some degree of humanity, ultimately the film chronicles the migration of ""civilization"" across the frontier and all the things it destroyed along the way.

You will find no warm, fuzzy idealization of the wild in this film. Robert Redford's character has decided to become a mountain man; and when he ventures into the elevated wilds of Utah, he gets all that comes with it, including treacherous dealings with the Native Americans. My teenage son watched this gem with me, and he had never seen anything like it.

68,jb0579,As close to perfect as it gets,9,22 February 2016,"Based on an amalgamation of real life people including a character named ""Liver Eatin' Johnson"", I will say that essentially the movie tells the story of a white man who drops from society to live a more simple, authentic life, finds himself at war with native peoples who, for generations, have called that area home. Johnson was more or less cajoled into breaking a sacred custom and is out for vengeance. As with the real life Johnson, he is confused, scared, mad and alone goes on a vengeful spree. So worthy of an adversary was he and so fierce was his revenge, eventually it was the wily and land-savvy indigenous peoples who sought him out for a truce. This was more or less the way of it. Now on to the technicalities of the film. Pollack has always been my favorite director. His understated direction and touching scores are the stuff of legend. Perfectly lit and beautifully shot, everyone pulls their weight. Perhaps Redford's best work, you can also expect to see Will Geer at the top of his game, and Stephan Gierasch & newcomer Delle Bolton (now a novelty shop owner in the southwest) take turns stealing their scenes as well. To say this is merely a great film does it a disservice. It's more than just great - it's quintessential. Its a must-see. The tension the viewer feels as Johnson stops cold on his mount, listening to the silence, sensing something is amiss after breaking a native custom and having quietly led a rescue party through a burial ground rivals anything in the movies today - albeit more is left to the imagination. But after all, don't we yearn for more movies wherein we are forced to contemplate plot as opposed to essentially having it all but captioned for us? See this and thank me.

69,dfwesley,Crow Indians for violating their burial grounds.,8,27 January 2016,"The writers and producers of REVENANT must have looked carefully at this movie to find some of their ideas. The setting were similar, the time frame was roughly the same, both heroes underwent like trials and tribulations. I cite he bear attack in Revenant and the wolves attack in this one. Indian vengeance, beautiful scenery and very cold weather were present in both. Differences there were. Jeremiah Johnson was not as long, was better lighted, and had a positive ending. Furthermore, this movie was properly researched, unlike the REVENANT. The tribes depicted here, the Blackfeet, the Flathead, and the Crow all lived near the Rockies and were enemies of each other and of the white man if the situation warranted. The Pawnee in REVENANT were in the wrong place and had good settler relations. I thought the manner in which the Indians pursued Redford was suspenseful and exciting. This was a very good film and Redford had a strong performance. The supporting actors, his Indian wife, mute son, and fellow mountain man added a humane element. The ending seemed to indicate that a truce was in the offing and that Jeremiah Johnson would be free of free of his pursuers.",Jeremiah Johnson
70,calsonassociates,Another film about humanity from Sydney Pollack.,10,8 November 2021,"Text: This story is about mankind. When you look out over the rivers, the hills, and the far horizon with a profound sense of your own littleness in the vast scheme of things, and yet have faith, hope, and courage - which is the root of every virtue. When you know that down in your heart every person is as noble, as vile, as divine, as diabolic, and as lonely as their own self, and seeks to know, to forgive, and to love your fellow humans.When you know how to sympathize with people in their sorrows, yea, even in their sins - knowing that each person fights a hard fight against many odds. When you have learned how to make friends and to keep them, and above all how to keep friends with yourself. When you love flowers, can hunt the birds without a gun, and feel the thrill of an old forgotten joy, when you hear the laugh of a little child.When you can be happy and high-minded amid the meaner drudgeries of life. When star-crowned trees, and the glint of sunlight on flowing waters, subdue you like the thought of one much loved and long dead; when no voice of distress reaches your ears in vain, and no hand seeks your aid without response.When you find good in every faith that helps any man to lay hold of divine things and sees majestic meanings in life, whatever the name of that faith may be. When you look into a wayside puddle and see something beyond mud, and into the face of the most forlorn mortal and see something beyond sin.When you know how to pray, how to love, how hope. When you have kept faith with yourself, with your fellow man, with your God; in your hand a sword for evil, in your heart a bit of a song - glad to live, but not afraid to die! Such a person has found the only real secret of life, and the one filmmakers continue to try to give to all the world.Thank you kindly. I remember from allegories, conferrals, and degrees of work among actors, crews, and more importantly, writers!Summary: What you do for yourself alone will die with you, what you do for others and the world will remain and be immortal. When warranted because of quality of story and significance of filmmakers and actors, I recall memories of beautiful stories portrayed on stage with trusted people to my side helping everyone equally as best they could. Jeremiah Johnson is a stand out film in my opinion only expressed here hopefully among trusted film lovers.",Jeremiah Johnson
71,epat,Thet warn't the real liver-eater.,7,29 March 2008,"Let me say at the outset, I like this film despite its shortcomings. It's worth seeing & Robert Redford played the title role as well as it could be played under the falsifications Hollywood imposed on it.The real Johnson's name was not Jeremiah, but just plain ""John Johnson"" lacks the euphony for box-office success, I guess. In any case, Johnson was better known to his contemporaries & to posterity by either of his nicknames, Crow Killer or Liver-Eatin' Johnson — & for good reason. His bloody feud with the Crow tribe, condensed into the final half hour of the film, lasted decades & was perhaps the defining factor of his legendary life. When this film was released in 1972, I don't guess audiences were ready for a hero who cut out the livers of his slain enemies & ate them raw. Picture Redford with a half-eaten handful of dripping human liver, as the blood streams down his chin into his beard. Yet this grisly fact was a very real part of who Johnson was & to flat-out ignore so elemental an aspect of his life is a Hollywood cop-out that deceptively sanitizes Johnson's savage life & times.Maybe nowadays, in an era when cannibalistic serial-killer Hannibal Lector can elicit our sneaking admiration as he fries pieces of a bad cop's brain & feeds them to him, the story of Liver-Eatin' Johnson could be told more honestly. He had a lot more adventures in his long life than we're ever shown & he came in contact with a fascinating rogues' gallery of characters besides Del Gue & Bear-claw Chris Lapp (splendidly played by Will Geer), who weren't given enough screen time to more fully develop their characters. Hatchet Jack Ireland, alive & well when Johnson knew him, turns up conveniently dead in the film as a mere device to furnish Johnson his introduction to the hazards of wilderness existence. Not even mentioned were such famous mountain men as Portuguese Phillips, White-Eye Anderson, Mariano Modeno, Bigfoot Davis, Anton Sepulveda, Apache Joe Millardo, Grizzly Bill Miller, Mad Mose & Wind River Jake, any of whose exploits might inspire a movie of their own.Perhaps the only way to do genuine cinematic justice to Liver-Eatin' Johnson & his contemporaries would be to re-make the film as a mini-series à la Lonesome Dove. And in these days, when damn near every film worth its salt — not to mention quite a few that aren't — is being re-made, I hope some worthy producer/director — How 'bout you, Bob Redford? — will take the hint.",Jeremiah Johnson
72,dan_pap,"Man vs. nature, man, himself",7,2 June 2019,"""Keep your nose in the wind and your eyes along the skyline.""I'd been wanting to watch Jeremiah Johnson for a long time, and my expectations were set pretty high. Starring Robert Redford as the title character, Jeremiah Johnson is a tale that explores conflicts between humans, nature, and oneself.This film isn't as good as I thought it would be but I still enjoyed it for the most part. The direction is great, and the fight scenes are especially well-done. The acting is a highlight too, with even the minor characters being able to pull their own weight. The scenery is beautiful, and I appreciate the quieter moments in the film to listen to the wildlife and running water. It adds to a more immersive experience for the audience.The movie tries to give itself a tall tale or epic kind of vibe toward the end. This would have worked fine if it was paced better. After the intermission, the story moves so fast, it's difficult to connect the Jeremiah Johnson at the beginning versus the one near the end. The nice-faced, innocent looking man goes full Anakin Skywalker out of nowhere, and it just doesn't suit his character.This is one of those stories that would have worked better as a miniseries. Jeremiah meets so many characters along the way, I wanted more of a connection. This also would have given more time to develop the main character. As a quick aside, not many people like the music, I enjoyed it a lot. I wish they could have gotten Johnny Cash to make a soundtrack. Jeremiah Johnson is enjoyable and fun, and I'm glad I finally got to watch it.""And some folks say he's up there still...""",Jeremiah Johnson
73,Attila_the_gorilla,They don't make them like this anymore,10,29 January 2010,"How has this one slipped under my radar so far?Jeremiah Johnson is based on the real-life story of the guy. In these cases, people often demand total factual accuracy and will reject fictional aspects. I don't like this approach. For me, a movie is about imagining, dreaming, and inspiring. It doesn't need to be a true story. If I can connect with it, then I will regard it as REAL, in which case I can allow it to have an effect on me.This movie certainly had an effect on me. It is magnificent, I think I will watch it regularly in the future - until I decide to live in the mountains myself :). It shows life in the wild is a very viable alternative and something humans are well suited to. Shame that nowadays we need to get all kinds of permits to even hunt for food. Instead you are expected to stuff yourself with factory farmed junk, living in an excessive 'shelter' made from industrial products, paying through the nose for a mortgage, tap water and gas.I will not talk about the movie's plot, if you like to dream about freedom, life in the wilderness, organic and indigenous living, then this film is a must watch. The scenery is awesome, the pacing is perfect, the soundtrack is fantastic.I've read comments about how Robert Redford, who is an avid Native American supporter, was willing to take on a role like this, killing lots of natives. These comments are totally deluded and are missing the point. There's nothing anti-native American about this movie, or about Jeremiah himself. He doesn't go out to kill natives, he simply kills people who hurt him or want to hurt him. Living in the wilderness, he is pretty much a native himself, but living by his own rules, rather than the rules of those tribes. In fact the very satisfying final scene completely dispels this ignorant notion.I have 2 issues with Jeremiah's way of living.One is the use of guns. Obviously, guns are made by the foolish empire one desires to leave behind. In my opinion they are totally needless for hunting, and can only serve as a destructive warring weapon, causing unnecessary injuries or deaths. It takes special skills to set traps and make bows and arrows, or other primitive weapons, but industry made guns do not belong in the wild. It's a great shame that post-European natives as well as white survivalists have regarded them a necessity.My other issue is his loneliness. I don't think it's necessary for survivalists or wilderness-men to go it alone. Of course he eventually had a woman and a boy, but neither were his own choice really. In my opinion the big extended family should and could be the base of life for people that decide to go this route. I understand though that very few eligible women are interested in this lifestyle.Obviously, these are not criticisms of the movie, but rather of the protagonist's life choices. In no way does it affect my rating of the film. 11 out of 10 if possible :).",Jeremiah Johnson

So much to hate, so little to like. None of the story makes the slightest bit of sense, and the 'acting' ranges from stupid to awful, with the exception of THE WALTONS' Will Geer as a predictably crazy old coot.

Even though different principles and goals separate these two civilizations in the clash for the same territory, there was common ground on the values of how to deserve the land and its gifts, and how to judge bravery and true spirituality.

Johnson becomes disillusioned, like Thoreau and even Ulysses S. Grant, by the Mexican War and deserts to become a mountain man.  There he finds the Rockies starkly beautiful and completely without mercy for him or anyone else.  Will Geer plays the older trapper who teaches the 'Pilgrim,' a very solid performance by Redford, how to survive. The film's treatments of Whites and Native Americans is profoundly even handed, and Milious's fingerprints are noteworthy in the robust and calculated course of the narrative.",Jeremiah Johnson
79,blueangel-76133,Jeremiah's Long Journey to Peace,10,6 October 2019,"This is one of the very best of the excellent Redford/Pollock collaborations (another being ""Three Days of The Condor""). Such a stark, honest and beautiful depiction of a man trying to find a peaceful, humane and fulfilling way of life, very well captured in the moment when Jeremiah tells his mentor character, played by the wonderful Will Geer, that he's come to the mountains because ""I been to a town."" The cinematography of the stunning mountain landscapes is a breathtaking backdrop to Redford's character's often painful learning process of the mountain's ""own ways"". And of course the terrible moral conundrum that the party of white settlers put him in that forces the conflict with the Indians wherein he must trespass on their sacred land or be responsible for the settlers deaths, mirrors lose-lose conflicts that any of us could, and probably will, face at some point in life. Then the moment when he meets his mentor again late in the film, and asks him what month it is and then gives such a deep, wrenching sigh when Geer says, ""Yes, winter's a long time going this high up,"" and we understand fully what he's truly gone through to, as Geer's character says, ""come far, pilgrim"". This journey is perfectly book ended by the opening scene where he makes wary, alienated contact with the Indian while fishing in the river, and then his plaintive, outstretched hand across the valley to that same Indian now greeting him that finally welcomes him to the peace and humanity we all must fight to find for ourselves. Again, what a beautifully humane, fulfilling film.",Jeremiah Johnson
80,Sage-c4,Archetype of its genre,10,17 December 2012,"The struggle of one man to make a new life for himself in an unfamiliar and uncompromising landscape. His infatuation with the high places and the hard life he finds there is presented as a series of episodes which would likely have devolved into formulaic tedium, despite Pollack's sure eye, but for the masterful writing of John Milius. Johnson progresses through initiation, testing, and mastery.Though Johnson is accused at one point of having ""gone native,"" this film does not stoop to the played-out whiteguiltmessiah trope of a renegade holding back the depredations of mechanization. This is not Fern Gully/Avatar or Dances With Wolves/Last Samurai. True, Johnson is disaffected and turns his back on the servitude of life down in the flats to seek an imagined Independence as a beaver trapper. That this is a vanishing livelihood past its heyday entirely suits his purpose. This is a latter day knight questing for an elusive grail. Those who have cried ""historical anachronism!"" have missed this point. Johnson's quest is an affirmation that such a life could still be lived, as an act of will. Oddly, because the films are otherwise so different, the closest analog to his spiritual plight that comes to mind is Jerry McGuire. But this film is no romantic comedy.This is a man's film. While it portrays relationships, they are not its essence. The main characters are all orphans of one sort or another, adrift in an uncaring if not purposefully hostile environment, taking occasional rest in the security of temporary alliances. The themes are manly abstractions like integrity, duty, territory. Femininity is portrayed as alien and inscrutable, both attractive and repellent. Violence is graphic and frequent, a necessity of life, sometimes an indulgence of vanity, and a consequence of carelessness.",Jeremiah Johnson

He carved out a lifestyle of ""Standing in your truth"". To dismiss Jeremiah as merely anti-social is an injustice. He wanted to embrace his vision of happiness; this realization was inextricably tied to the wilderness and the beauty he longed to carve out of it....Will Geer is a revelation in his role as Johnson's impromptu wilderness teacher and guide. He is a complex, unflinching man who himself is a study in swimming against the tide...There are moments of sheer beauty in this story. You'll need them to steady yourself later in the story...Most of us in our lifetime have at one time or another, been compelled to embrace an agenda that is really not our own. We may have been deliberately misled, or of our own negligence, ill informed as to the 360 degrees of such a cause...The outcome finds us mere onlookers as a latent evil takes center stage, and thrusts the well-intended into a dark tunnel. In Jeremiah's case, he is so devastated that survival and retribution become one and the same. We too embrace his outrage.

He plays a man disillusioned (& probably shell-shocked) from fighting in a war he does not care about, nor wants to, who embarks on the solitary life of mountain man. A life where every day is not only a battle with Nature to survive but also against hostile Indians. A beautifully made film, it is as much a journey of self discovery as it is about the brave, solitary life of the mountain men themselves. The character's joy in at long last finding company again in the form of an Indian wife & a young white boy traumatised from losing his parents to Indians, was so well done. Then, when he loses them we too can feel the grief, feel the isolation & loneliness creeping back in, such was the intensity of those scenes!

87,Bogie27,Watch yer Topknot,8,6 July 2010,"The 1830's era of free trapping were some of the very toughest of times, and this early period western is one of my favorite Sidney Pollack films. It centers historically on the free trapping of beaver in the American west. The movie is a cult classic among those familiar with the lives and legends of the free trappers. The movie is loosely based on the book, ""Mountain Man"" by Vardis Fisher. The character invented by Fisher is a combination of mountaineers based on the incredible legends of men like, Liver eating Johnston and John Colter. Pollack had also directed ""The Scalphunters"" in 1968 which was a film about trapping in the west. This earlier film may have helped lay a foundation of experience for ""Jeremiah Johnson"".This film chronicles the journey of Jeremiah Johnson as he begins a life in the mountains in his pursuit of free trapping. The choice of Robert Redford for Johnson seems pretty natural for a movie in this time frame. Pollack would have needed someone like Redford as a box office draw, and also, to insure this 1830's mountain film seemed more attractive and compelling to a younger audience. Although Redford did a good job, I'll always wonder what Steve McQueen would have done with this role. The film was shot in various national parks in Utah and contains many winter scenes and sounds that really add to the story.As with any journey type of story, we see that Johnson encounters things and people that help him along his trail in the mountains. Initially, it appears he is on his way to becoming a first season causality before he acquires the help of mountain man veteran Bearclaw Crislap played by Will Geer. In following acquaintances however, he isn't as lucky.The film offers up an explanation of why the mountain men ventured into such a harsh existence. Few things could have been more dangerous as trapping beaver in the Rocky mountains. So many things were there to kill you. The elements, animals and angry Indians were equally up to the task. However, these rules were as clear as the mountain air, and the mountain men seemed to appreciate that. So, the mountains were a symbol of purity - they were closer to God - the air was cleaner. There is constant images of white snow covered scenery that helps the movie convey this message. The characters of Bearclaw and Del Que are quite often delivering lines and messages that express their passion for mountain life and the great pride and respect for this existence. We see the mountains begin to develop as a character themselves. ""The mountain got it's way"", says BearClaw. Indeed, the mountains seems to communicate with BearClaw. And later the winds sing a sirens song to warn Jeremiah when trouble has found it's way into his life. This mysticism also has something to do with the character of Jeremiah. He never says too much about his reasons for leaving the towns below for mountain life. Unlike Del Que and Bearclaw he doesn't say much about his passion for the mountains.After Johnson has successfully run the gamut of dangers in mountain life, he again encounters some the first few people he met when he entered the mountains. He meets them again in reverse order, and we begin to realize Jeremiah's journey has taken him full circle and the story is nearing completion. We see in the end that Jeremiah has completed his journey, from apprentice to the status of Mountain Man.",Jeremiah Johnson

The Reverend was shown to be disdainful of the sanctity of Indian burial grounds, while his mission saving the hapless Christians was portrayed as more or less a fool's errand. Basically the stupid Christians got themselves into this predicament, and the conniving Reverend belittled and cajoled Jeremiah into rescuing them.

It was as if he kept climbing higher and higher in search of God, or peace, or truth or something. What he found was himself. And he liked what he found. How absolutely beautiful is that?",Jeremiah Johnson
95,nelson_l,"""This movie has remained one of my alltime favorites..""",9,5 September 2000,"""This movie has remained one of my all-time favorites. The combination of the scenery and story-line is one that is difficult to beat. Robert Redford is at his peak performance in the role of the mountain man, Jeremiah Johnson. Also, there's an air about it that is common to all people, i.e., wishing for a peaceful existence and being given instead a set of life circumstances that says if this is what you want, you must fight for it. I have only accolades for this movie. It is great!",Jeremiah Johnson
96,yogibearbobo,One of the best movies ever!,10,2 February 2021,"My favorite movie, a must watch if you like adventure stories.
Perfect blend of action, adventure, scenery and some humor.",Jeremiah Johnson
97,cinegreece,Redford's Best?,9,8 October 2007,"This movie is simply perfect. Pollack always loved making movies about nature and its relationship with people. On this one he managed to reach a high level of perfection. It's a well driven character movie. It's not western, it's not documentary, it's not pure drama. It's a little bit of everything, but mostly a study about human communication and feelings. Jeremiah was a man who wanted his privacy, liked to be free. He yearned for freedom and in his loneliness he found a family to love. And when he did it didn't last. So, Jeremiah became an animal with just his instict for survival left in him. Robert Redford gives his greatest performance to date in this masterpiece. He always uses his eyes as a mirror to the soul of his characters and in this beautiful movie you seem to forget that Jeremiah Johnson is just a movie character. You feel his anger, hear his yearning for love. Redford should have won an Oscar on this one, but who cares after all?",Jeremiah Johnson
98,jbae,Enjoyable conflict between nature and man,9,9 October 1998,"My first thought: Robert Redford the mountain man? The hillbilly music did nothing to disperse this twisted image of good ol' Bob wrestling naked with a bear... Surprisingly enough, the movie was a rather enjoyable experience for someone who enjoys his westerns hardboiled with flying bullets (i.e. Wild Bunch). The action was fun, dialogue well written (for the most part) and it had no ending. Robert Redford did a smashing job of doing the stunts and fights throughout the movie. The supporting cast was, well, very supportive. I recommend this film to all Western junkies. Also, it should be noted that the DVD of this film is superb in transfer and with additional materials.",Jeremiah Johnson
99,kathy-carlson1,"Classic, capturing, very enjoyable",9,10 March 2007,"I really enjoyed this movie. It was very well-done. The story was excellent, the setting was fascinating and beautiful. It portrayed a time in US history, the 1830s, that is very underrepresented in film. I watched it with my husband and my three year old. We were all riveted. I missed the first half hour and went back to watch it again to fill in the blanks. When we caught up to where I had come in the first time, none of us wanted to turn off the movie but wanted to watch all over again. A movie that I want to watch twice is a movie worth seeing at least once. I particularly liked the way the story wrapped around itself. The play between the different cultures was fascinating. It had humor and hardship, beauty and savagery, and people both prevailing and failing against nature and each other.",Jeremiah Johnson
100,malachibooker,"Top 5 "" Western"" of all time",10,16 March 2020,"Categorized as a Western but closer to "" The Revenant"" type movie its a must watch if you call yourself an outdoors man, Great Movie, Great Acting, Enjoy",Jeremiah Johnson
101,tehknophiliac,One of the best westerns besides Monte Walsh ever made,9,29 March 2003,"I put this along Unforgiven and Monte Walsh as some of the best westerns and movies made. The noble spiritual indian is kind of passe' now, PC sillyness attributing all sorts of wonderful things to people who ate each other, killed and raped each other daily and tortured people to death is besides the point...very lush photography and a great man against odds film.",Jeremiah Johnson
102,lpmobrie,Masterpiece,10,23 May 2006,"Pollack and Redford have never done any film that is better than this. It is a classic. I grew up watching Jerimiah Johnson. He was a legend in our house and the movie is perfect. Beautiful scenery and cinematography. Simple, but straightforward and powerful script. Excellent cast (especially Wil Geer), and a great story in general. They don't make films like this any more. If they did, we'd have a greater appreciation for true old west and mountain adventure. Rent it. Watch it. Learn something about a life that most North Americans know nothing about. Even if you're simply a nature-lover, this film will be worth your time. This film is one of my top five favourites.",Jeremiah Johnson
103,gemma-leanne,Intriguing but Slow,4,26 March 2016,"If you wan to explore the history of Native Americans, this is a good start. This film introduces the customs of Native Americans. However, I found this film a bit too long. It is brutal in parts, but nothing too gruesome. I would have preferred to watch this film on a Sunday afternoon with my family. It's slow, uneventful and lacking in many areas. I found the soundtrack off-putting, especially the self-titled intro music. Robert Redford plays his character brilliantly, as do all the actors, (and horses,) it just seemed a little dated and, although I'm not much of a fan of remakes, I believe this particular film could really benefit from a revamp.It is a good film, but not for me, sorry.",Jeremiah Johnson
104,djtodd,An entertaining yet artistic film...,9,27 November 2005,"I found ""Jeremiah Johnson"" to be both entertaining and artistic. It is beautifully shot and, due to it's age, has a distinctly antique feel to it that only adds to its rustic feel. Perhaps the most compelling thing about the picture is that it seems to incorporate both a contempoary sensibility and some connections to the more traditional style westerns.When I say ""contemporary sensibility"" I am talking about the fact that the Indians are neither good or bad, nor are the white men...you see good and evil reflected in both groups. Furthermore, the dialogue is sparse yet realistic. Some of the music and dialogue may sound a bit cheesy, but I chalk that up to the fact that the film is already over thirty years old! The acting is good, despite a few lines that sound stilted.On the other hand, it comes down to the white man vs. the Indians, like so many Spaghetti Westerns. Despite this fact, the film never boils down to a final fight scene or Hollywood ending, but rather ends sublimely with a theme emerging that is more about inner peace than any fight.Overall, however, the film is both haunting and beautiful. It is paced evenly, for the most part, and we care about Johnson although most of what we know about him we can only assume. The film also depicts a great deal of realism in the details regarding survival, hunting and the Old West.I don't know why it took me so long to finally see this. In fact, it's now officially one of my top ten favorite films of all time! 5 Stars",Jeremiah Johnson
105,wayne-47,Bearclaw favorite character,10,28 January 1999,My favorite character is Bearclaw played by Will Geer.  I think he does an excellent job of playing a mountain man.  I especially enjoyed the part were he ask Jeremiah if he could skin griz and was told as fast as he could find them.  He then delivers one (live).,Jeremiah Johnson
106,dclastcolony-12110,Could Have Been So Much Better,4,28 July 2020,"This movie has a lot going for it -- the superb direction of Sydney Pollack -- great acting by Robert Redford -- and gorgeous cinematography in Utah. Its theme also is one that is captivating and that has always interested me -- men alone living in the wilderness and coping as best they can.Unfortunately, the movie descends into a conventional Western -- replete with Indian attacks, massacres, and much else. Redford has to contend with so much so he barely has enough time to deal with the elements. Just too much happens in this film for there to be an adequate development of character. What could have been a keen exploration of a solitary life in the Rocky Mountains descends into an action movie -- and a politically incorrect one by today's standards since most of the Indians in the film are portrayed as savages.This is a problem that often plagues American and English films. So often, they are unable or unwilling to explore the inner life, as so many French movies do, for example. French directors learned long ago that character exploration in and of itself can be interesting and compelling without the need to add the kind of events that rarely takes place in most people's lives -- even in the wilderness.Having said that, the movie is based on a book of the same name. So, I suppose the director decided to stick with that story line.",Jeremiah Johnson
107,mikeriley-06609,One of my all time favorite movies,10,14 February 2020,"I have watched Jerimiah Johnson so many times I have lost count. Great performances, great dialogue, awesome cinematography! I have loved sharing this with others over the years, and was especially happy that my son appreciated it as much as I do...maybe as much! Highly recommend!",Jeremiah Johnson
108,NRLGriffey,Great Father and Son Movie,10,9 November 2004,"This is one of my all time favorite movies and evokes so much emotion from my childhood. My father and I have watched this movie at least 10 times together and it never gets boring. It reminds me of my days when we used to go on hikes in the woods and we would sing the theme song with me in my little coonskin (it's fake for all you animal lovers) cap. I just cannot get enough of this movie. It grows on my every time I watch it. It is one of if not the best Robert Redford movie ever. He does a fantastic job in this movie. The scenery is beautiful and makes me wish I was there in that unspoiled area. The dialogue, though there is very little compared to other movies, is brilliant. The old adage quality not quantity fits this movie to a tee. There are numerous one liners that have been incorporated into my everday vocabulary. ""You cook good rabbit pilgrim."" ""....the Rocky Mountains are the marrow of the world..."" ""Watch your top notch."" ""Watch Yur'n."" I could go on and on. Each character is colorful in it's own distinct way, making even the most insignificant ones unforgettable. The theme music is both haunting and beautiful and I've been looking to buy or download the soundtrack so if anyone knows where I could send me an e-mail. Not only does this movie have great characters,acting, dialogue, music, and scenery, but it also is filled with action and has several interjections of humor. I feel as though this is one of the greatest movies of all time and the special moments you share with your family watching it, just make this movie even better. (A 9/10).",Jeremiah Johnson
109,A4thHorse,A Superb Portrayal of American Spirit,10,26 November 2008,"This is easily my favorite movie of all. It is as superb a portrayal of the American Spirit as you will find in any movie.Some movies make out being American to be more glamorous, some more boastful, some more rejoiceful, some more overtly patriotic. Some show the more recent decent into violence, drugs, sex or valueless, soulless nihilism.This movie simply shows the true spirit. Men who desire freedom and the solace it brings the soul. Peace thru relative solitude. It also shows that Americans are willing to help others, even at expense to themselves (a.k.a. common decency). And it shows the resilience that marks Americans.The script is perfect, treading lightly and smartly, never intruding or overbearing, deftly crafted. Redford is outstanding, his love of the land, his skill and his care for the movie clear. Will Geer and Stefan Gerasch are superbly cast and lend the perfect companions to Redford's Johnson. The cinematography is excellent and the land provides the perfect overarching character, nurturing and uplifting both the characters and audience in unison.",Jeremiah Johnson
110,cine6fr,What the hell is this?,1,25 May 2000,"Today in my AP United States History class, I assumed that I would be enlightened with a feature film about United States history.  When I walked in, I did not expect to see a flick like Jeremiah Johnson.  Let me say this, it blew my mind how much of a stereotypical view of the world this movie is. Apparently, Indians are the stupidest people in the world; Robert Redford has an orgasm after he teaches someone how to say ""yes""; and everyone has a heavy drawl.  Now I realize that it had something to do with Frederick Jackson Turner's frontier thesis, but I sure hope my character wasn't shaped by this retard.  To date, I have seen half of the movie.  I don't really want to watch the second half, but I will be forced to.  Couple of things I did like: 1)zoom-up of Redford which makes him look stupider. 2)""I make damn good biscuits boy"" (In case you didn't know, I was being sarcastic) Something I really did like: my vote 1/10",Jeremiah Johnson
111,paleok,Worth Seeing Several Times,9,28 June 2007,"I have noticed something peculiar. Reviews of people not from North America seem rate the movie poorly. Perhaps one needs to be steeped in the mythos of the frontier and an appreciation of where we Americans (especially the people of the US) were after Vietnam. Yes the film uses archetypes and yes there are what you could call ""bad Indians"". But this is film is more than the sum of its parts. It is about a man escaping the bellicosity of the US for the peace of the wilderness (see Thoreau) and to find his place in the world. This is a typically American idea. This theme is seen throughout the first half.But then, his American heritage, his inability to throughly appreciate the native culture, and his response to family's death eventually put Johnson in conflict with the Indians who lived there before him. Yes he kills but the film treats these amorally. The Crow even respect him for he abilities, but his wariness of fighting at the end is palpable (read in American involvement in Vietnam). This film offers more three-dimensional characters and realistic set-pieces than Dances with Wolves (Whites are bad) or traditional westerns (Indians are bad without reason). I think this film is still apropos today; especially today.But aside from that, it is a beautifully acted and shoot movie. The imagery of the mountains cannot be beat. Please, please check this out even as a pop-corn flick and you won't be disappointed.",Jeremiah Johnson
112,kainatav,Being of sound mind and broke legs,10,23 February 2007,Jeremiah Johnson is made in the mold of what movies should be. In an era of blockbusters and CGI graphics it's nice to see a movie that gets back to basics. Jeremiah is an ex army man who moves to the Rockies to start over. He starts out as a novice in the ways of the woods. With the help of Will Geer (Grandpa Walton) Jeremiah forges himself a place in the wild. The ending is kind of sad but I won't go into any details. This movie doesn't go into great detail about his subsequent rampage on the local Indian population. But if I wanted a documentary then I would watch the history channel. Anyway Jeremiah Johnson is a great movie to watch on a cold night when the wind is blowing and it's good to be inside. For a good adventure Jeremiah Johnson is one to watch again and again.,Jeremiah Johnson
113,spamproofme,Not a terribly bad way to waste time if you have a lot time to waste terribly.,6,15 December 2018,I usually like R. Redford's acting but not this time.

114,gezieteruit,Beautiful,10,18 December 2016,"After not having watched any of the classic westerns in a long time somebody told me I should watch Jeremiah Johnson...I'm so happy I listened! This movie is beautiful, just so beautiful that alone is enough to give it a try, the story is amazing as well! On top of that it has aged very well, if they made the same movie today it would probably look the same (or worse).Have look and judge for yourself, you will not be disappointed!A classic among classics.Recommended!",Jeremiah Johnson
115,mike5636,The greatest,10,24 February 2000,"The subtle lines and voice inflictions by Robert Redford combined with the storyline, make this, in my opinion, the best movie of its type.  ie... mountain man, pre wild west.It made me a RR fan.

116,kasstearns,Redford portrays the 3000 yard stare that returning Vietnam Veterans of this era know so well,8,21 April 2006,"This is a movie of uneven quality. But its good moments are gems. In particular there is a scene toward the end of the movie when Jerimiah meets his old mentor played by Will Geer. By this time Jerimiah has lost everything in the mountains including a beautiful wife and boy. A veteran of the Mexican War he has fled the insanity of the ""flatlanders"" only to be caught up in a vendetta with the Crow Nation. In this meeting Redford's and Geer's characters exchange a beautiful masculine strength and sensitivity to one another's situation and Redford portrays the 3000 yard stare that returning Vietnam Veterans of this era know so well. Some of the background music of this movie is exceptional also.",Jeremiah Johnson
117,wicardshark,Stark and beautiful,10,22 December 2006,"This film provides a great look at the life of the mountain man in the Rockies during the 1860's. For any of you who have occasionally longed for the simpler life, this film helps to show how complicated that life can be. Filmed with the backdrop of picturesque landscapes and big blue skies, this is a film that is best viewed on the big screen and could easily be enjoyed with the sound off.The story is simple and simply told but with touching moments of human compassion that reach for a place of peace inside all of us and succeeds more often than it fails at sharing the essence of this lifestyle with the viewer. Even amidst the violent scenes you get a sense of harmony - a straightforward kill or be killed code that clarifies all the films encounters.If you liked Dances with Wolves, this is an earlier version of that same genre - the thinking man's Western.",Jeremiah Johnson
118,ronpmartin,favorite movie,10,5 January 2007,"my favorite movie ever! details of mountain living and personal relationships and social commentary all good i would add two quotes however when camping,Robert Redford gets burned because he ""didn't put enough dirt down i saw it right off"" and when selecting a home site he says ""good water,cliffs behind, this will be a good place to live"" also would probably add tehe reverends comment ""these are Christian men and women"" have read before that this was one of Redford's favorite movies although he did get cold filming the scene trying to catch the fish also was glad they refrained from having the boy speak after spending time with Jeremiah the scene of him watching his house burn is also classic",Jeremiah Johnson
119,taofpaul,"Provo Utah Canyon, Zion's National Park, Green River and Robert Redford",10,20 January 2007,"I Was born in Idaho just east of West Yellowstone National Park, and grew up in Washington State. As a result I spent many years in the outdoors of Canada, Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming and Washington. But when I went camping about two miles up the road from Robert Redford's Utah home (not knowing that he lived there at the time) in my early twenties I immediately moved to Utah. The opening scenes and much of the film is on the north side of Mount Timpanogos. So like Robert Redford the land of Utah brought me here and has kept me here for almost 30 years. Most of the land in the movie is still as pristine now as it was then. The first time I watched this movie was in 2007 and I have to say that the mountain scenes make my heart ache with love for this land. I now live in southern Utah and spend many weekends up in the desert mountains shown in this film near Zion National Park. As an avid fly fisher I have spent many years in the most remote streams and landscapes of this beautiful State. This movie really captures the Spirit of Utah. Thank you Robert Redford and Sidndy Pollack for capturing the very real essence of this land. If you loved this movie then please come visit us and enjoy our State.",Jeremiah Johnson
120,smpadea,A Terrific Movie,10,26 March 2002,"This is one of those movies I can watch over and over again. It has beautiful scenery and a great story line. Robert Redford is a ""Natural"" actor. I would see any film he has either acted in, directed or produced.",Jeremiah Johnson
121,pvideoproductions,An under-appreciated classic film,9,10 June 2008,"Few people took notice when the movie, Jeremiah Johnson, hit the theaters in 1972. It was considered a movie for hikers, backpackers, and people that enjoyed the wilderness. I paid to see the wilderness scenes and instead, I fell in love with a great storyline. Looking back, it may have reflected some sentiment against the Vietnam War; leaving the army and the senseless killing, and striking out for solitude and peace of nature. Who knows?I never considered this great flick a ""western"". I find it strange it was called a ""western' because it has none of the flimsy, reckless elements of the genre. But the Johnson film breaks new ground; a chilling almost haunting depiction of a pioneer's life. The movie doesn't seem to care if you are entertained or not. Jeremiah Johnson appears as a a documentary and doesn't take sides. The Crows had their rules and Jeremiah had his journey to run. The movie's slow pace and story development is a joy to watch in contrast to more recent films that pack action into every scene. Like many great films, it's a movie that either makes you think or you can simply watch, picking up small details each time viewed. I'm surprised how the movie continues to wear well on audiences more than 35 years later. Redford and supporting cast of little known actors was outstanding. Will Geer played a crucial role in the film to support Redford. The worrisome entanglement of Jeremiah's life from simple desire to hunt and fish to becoming a killer grows with every turn. Jeremiah had this super-human spiritual sense of ""feeling"" something without seeing. How long can a man survive when he is constantly hunted down? How many fights can he win? I didn't care for the ending. I wish it could have been more defined. But the ending simply adds to the mystery of the story; a great movie. I'm reminded that the film has no swearing, and no excessive gore. Yet overall, this gem of a movie will surprise you in simplicity and in depth.",Jeremiah Johnson
122,lance0381,This movie begs to be redone,10,1 February 2011,"I absolutely loved this movie. The dialogue, the characters, the setting, the story, the acting: they were all superb. But the one thing I couldn't stop thinking about was how poor the film quality was 30 years ago.Normally I'm not a huge fan of remakes. But if this movie had been filmed in HD with proper camera optics (you can clearly see a fish-eye effect when the camera pans over a scene) it would have been absolutely spectacular. The dramatic colors of the Rocky Mountains and the detail in the landscapes would be brought to center stage instead of being drowned in graininess. Please, producers of Hollywood, tell this tale again with modern technology!",Jeremiah Johnson
123,chase_cabot,Beautiful film with deep insight into human interactions.,8,4 June 2013,"I originally discovered Jeremiah Johnson while on IMDb (go figure) while browsing the westerns. I have seen many westerns in my time, and a good few were generic or shallow, but Jeremiah Johnson looked like a unique film to me, so I rented it. I was not disappointed. Jeremiah Johnson is more than a western, it quite accurately and deeply depicts the mentality and desire to escape from society and the problems in our lives, while also portraying human interaction in a way I found touching. With each new person he meets, we see a new character interaction, with Bear Claw we see salvation and gratitude in Johnson, and the ""family"" he later has reveals companionship and deep affection even when it begins in odd and tense situations. Overall, we see reflected onto us how much meaning our interactions with others have, even though that meaning becomes lost in the jumble of our daily lives. Johnson also embodies the desire for humans escape their situation for something more peaceful. In Johnson we see ourselves, we see our desire to find something better, sometimes for solitude. In summary, the interactions between people and what it reveals about human nature is what makes Jeremiah Johnson a truly beautiful movie.",Jeremiah Johnson
124,mikebenefield1,Brilliant Film Which Speaks Volumes Without Much Dialog,10,21 March 2013,"A veteran (Robert Redford) of the Mexican War (1848) rejects society, where ""It should have been different""; to become a mountain man. Unfortunately the economy of the mountain man era has ended in the late 1830's leaving the main character to wander the wilderness until he happens to meet a veteran mountain man (Will Geer), who teaches him the ways of the mountain man. The film explores the need that human beings have for human contact, in spite of whatever sense of isolation and alienation that society may expose them to. The film is also one of the first to portray Native Americans in a complex manner; revealing them to be something more than a white caricature. The film uses a powerful dialog, that while limited; is packed with deeper meanings that would be lost to many who watched the film. The limited dialog is carried by stunning scenery, which further serves to make a statement about loneliness and isolation. Add to this the bitter cold in which the main character is at constant battle with and the viewer will want to throw another log on the fire. The main character conducts a war of retribution against the Crow after they kill his Flathead wife and an orphan boy. In the end the outcome is left to the viewer.",Jeremiah Johnson

I have seen a lot of movies and this is one of the all time top 10 I have seen in my life. Do not watch it with people who have to talk and comment and distract you. Pay attention. It is excellent and very true to the real mountain men era.My father was a trapper in Alaska. The trapping scenes are very realistic. I have many Native American friends in Montana and Alaska. This film is fair with their culture as far as it goes. I have been part of clubs who research and re enact the mountain man era. It is an authentic movie with a very good story. It should be required viewing in all high schools and colleges.",Jeremiah Johnson
126,kenw-11,One of my favorites,10,3 May 2008,I agree with most who write of this movie it is simply made but very powerful. My wife and I watch this movie 3 or 4 times a year and never tire of it. We also use some of the lines as sort of a private joke when we are with others. They never get it. When I want her to be quiet I will say as best I can the words Jeremiah uses to Swan when the solders are coming to the cabin.The music is haunting and the scenery is breathtaking. This movie is almost in a category to itself and I wonder if one like it could be made today. Although some of Redfords mannerisms in Horse Whisperer remind me of Jeremiah. The few things that I don't like is the obligatory bigoted minister and the reference to where they will go in the end.(Hell) Overall though simply one if not the best movie ever made.,Jeremiah Johnson
127,rbstev142,question,9,2 March 2006,"Can anyone tell me what became of Delle Bolton, who played the part of Swan, Johnson's squaw, after the film was made. There are no other cinematic credits to her name. Although her part in the movie was small, it was an important element of the story, and her capabilities as an actress convincing. It is especially odd that she seems to have disappeared without trace as she was billed in the credits as ""introducing Delle Bolton"". The recognised movie and actor/actress web sites carry no biographical information about her and she does not gain more than a mention in articles and reviews of Jeremiah Johnson. Perhaps someone knows what became of her after this one movie appearance",Jeremiah Johnson

It is one of those films which you wish you could rewrite the ending and have it go on and on.The haunting music, beautiful scenery and the absence of useless dialog, makes for a peaceful film that allows you to share his (Johnson's) feelings from his joy with his Indian wife and adopted son to the sorrow of their murder.I think the theme music and the unusual quietness of the film is part of its attraction for me. The many scenes set in the birch woods by streams with the eagle flying overhead is reminiscent of the Mountain Men, a somewhat similar film.",Jeremiah Johnson
