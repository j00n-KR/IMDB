0,SnoopyStyle,Action actors try comedy,6,16 August 2013,"Two CIA spies FDR Foster (Chris Pine) and Tuck (Tom Hardy) find themselves fighting over the affections of unsuspecting Lauren (Reese Witherspoon). They employ all their spy craft to comedic effects.The main problem with this is that none of these people are best known for their comedic chops. Sure Chris Pine and Tom Hardy may do some jokes as they gun down the bad guys, and Reese Witherspoon is the queen of rom-com. None of them do the kind of slapstick broad comedy seen here and it shows. The same goes for McG. Because of the ridiculousness of the subject matter, any realism or action really don't ring true. So the movie missed the mark. However everybody is very likable and watchable.",This Means War
1,Prismark10,This means garbage,2,23 March 2014,"McG has a patchy record as a film director. Plenty of flash but nothing much when it comes to a coherent story. Here he wants to enter True Lies territory by mixing espionage, action, romance and comedy and baked a mess.Two CIA agents, FDR (Chris Pine)and Tuck (Tom Hardy) are suspended for messing up a covert operation in Hong Kong. They start to look at online dating and end up falling for the same woman, Lauren (Reece Witherspoon.)This means the comrades become rivals by seeking attention for the same women and using CIA resources in the process as they increasingly use unfair means. However here the comedy just seems forced and unfunny and there is no romantic sparks as I simply do not buy Reece Witherspoon as a single thirtysomething.Tuck is more genuine, caring and honest but is regarded as unsuitable because he is British, although it is never explained what he is doing in the CIA. FDR is an egoist, more showy, shallow and willing to use deception to get the girl.Somewhere along the line there is a German terrorist out for revenge but hey, not to worry lets get the CIA agents fight each other in a restaurant when there are lives at risk.The film is a chore to watch, boring, the action sequences are not up to much, the romance and comedy is ham fisted. Pine and Hardy do their best with such poor material and at least show some charm and chemistry with each other but the film is a disaster.",This Means War
2,kosmasp,No sense,7,11 May 2012,"And I really mean it. It doesn't make a lick of sense. There are holes in the script, in its internal logic (theatrical version) that might make some cringe. But I have to admit, that I kinda enjoyed myself watching it. And isn't that what this was about? Or what it was aiming for? You can see where this is heading from the start (well almost the start that is).I honestly think that if the trailer wasn't for you, you shouldn't watch the movie. You'll hate it and yourself for doing so. I wasn't a big fan of Charlies Angels (the movies). Especially the second one, that also ""stole"" a music cue from Scorseses ""Cape Fear"" was plain ridiculous. Even if it was supposed to be funny (it wasn't), it did not work, no matter what angle you'd look on it. But this is a whole different beast. Pine and Hardy are having the time of their life. Til Schweiger is a bit disappointing (though he obviously is only playing a secondary role in the whole ""romantic spy"" thing), but overall you can have fun with this, if you let yourself to.",This Means War
3,jboothmillard,This Means War,4,28 August 2012,"I saw the trailer while this film was released, and it certainly sounded like a good fun film, so I was kind of surprised by the critics opinion, but I had to decide for myself, from director McG (Charlie's Angels, Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, Terminator Salvation). Basically CIA agents Franklin Delano Roosevelt 'FDR' Foster (Star Trek's Chris Pine) and Tuck Hansen (Bronson's Tom Hardy) have been partners and best friends for years, they have recently caused a problem when trying to prevent international criminal Karl Heinrich (Til Schweiger) from acquiring a weapon of mass destruction, and they have him wanting revenge for the death of his brother. Their boss Collins (Angela Bassett) wants to make sure they are protected, so upon returning to America they are assigned to desk duty, FDR uses the identity of a cruise ship captain as his cover and is a womaniser, and Tuck presents himself, especially with his ex-wife Katie (Abigail Spencer) and son Joe (John Paul Ruttan), as a travel agent. Lauren Scott (Reese Witherspoon) is a product testing executive, who has to deal with seeing her ex-boyfriend engaged to another woman, and her best friend Trish (Chelsea Handler) insists that she should try online dating, and without Lauren's permission, she puts a profile for her on a recently advertised website. Coincidentally Tuck put his profile on this website as well, so soon enough he gets to meet Lauren, they arrange a date, and FDR insists he is nearby as a backup, but the two of them hit it off very quickly. Shortly afterwards FDR runs into Lauren in a video rental store, not realising she is Tuck's date, and he flirts with her despite her lack of interest in him because of his ladies man vibe, but he finds her again at one of her product meetings where she gives in and agrees to a date. The next day FDR and Tuck talk to each other about meeting great dates, and they are devastated to realise that they are seeing the same woman, but they settle not on letting one have the other, but seeing who can make her most happy, with some rules in the deal, e.g. no sex. Lauren meanwhile feels guilty dating two men at the same time, and is obviously unaware that they both know each other, but she goes along with it with the advice from Trish, and both men are breaking the rules, finding out her likes to please her, and trying to sabotage each other's dates. FDR breaks the rule when he and Lauren have sex, and Tuck nearly does so as well, but she stops it when she feels bad about herself and what she is doing, FDR wrongly assumes that they did have sex because the bug he used was damaged. FDR has found out that Heinrich is in America searching for the spies to get his revenge, he tries to warn Tuck of the situation while on a date with Lauren, but this turns into an argument and fist fight, and in the process Lauren realises they know each other, and she storms out, leaving Trish with them. At that moment Lauren and Trish are snatched by Heinrich's men, and the two agents chase after them, and obviously the women realise they are CIA agents, and it is Lauren with her product knowledge of cars that helps them defeat the villains. As Heinrich dies with his car going off the unfinished bridge, she chooses FDR as the man she wants to be with, Tuck accepts this and makes up with his best friend, the last scenes see him and Katie reconcile and get married again. In the last scene Katie obviously accepts that Tuck is a CIA agent, and Lauren calls FDR while he is on a mission with his friend, and he even admits to Tuck that he wants to marry Lauren, and before she met Tuck he had sex with Katie, Tuck is angry because he didn't have sex with Lauren, and they tackle out of the helicopter. Also starring Laura Vandervoort as Britta and Spider-Man's Rosemary Harris as Nana Foster. Witherspoon is attractive and sometimes feisty as the girl the spies compete for, Pine is alright as the sleazy good-looking guy, and Tuck is likable as the English gent. I expected this to be something like Mr. and Mrs. Smith, guns blazing with the spies or whatever as they fight over the girl, that might have been funnier, the story has some relatively amusing moments, but overall it is a bit of a predictable romantic spy comedy. Okay!",This Means War
4,paul_haakonsen,"Romantic spy comedy, but you have to look hard to find the comedy...",5,27 May 2012,"I had expected somewhat a bit more from this movie.We follow two CIA agents, FDR (played by Chris Pine) and Tuck (played by Tom Hardy) who both turn out to be dating the same girl, Lauren (played by Reese Witherspoon). And in their attempts to win the heart of Lauren, the two friends have to keep each other in check, as to not let the competitor win the heart of the woman.The story in ""This Means War"" was entertaining, yes, but it was so implausible that it was painful to watch. Never heard of CIA agents using government funds, man-hours and equipment to spy (or do surveillance) on someone they want to date, and in order to keep the other from going to far. And because the agents were 'grounded', they were just allowed to come and go (not to mention do) what they pleased? They didn't have to do any actual work? Right, where do I sign up for that job? That whole concepts was just so far-fetched that it was hard to buy into. Don't get me wrong, though, because the movie is good entertainment, just don't look at it from a realistic point of view.The people they had cast for ""This Means War"" were actually doing great jobs with their roles, though the movie just suffered horribly from having too much of an unrealistic approach for its execution.""This Means War"" had surprisingly few laughs in it, which was a disappointment. The action scenes, however, were quite well executed, with a lot of usage of the 'slowing down the action'-sequences. It looked good, and it worked well.Being a hybrid of romance, action and spy-movie, ""This Means War"" does provide fun entertainment for a single evening, though I doubt the movie has sufficient contents to sustain being watched a second time. I know that I, personally, will not be making a second watching of it, the whole unrealistic storyline just didn't work out for me.",This Means War
5,Scarecrow-88,This Means War,6,10 August 2013,"Savaged by critics upon release, ""This Means War"" wasn't exactly a must-see film for me. This was the case of ""well, it is on, and I have nothing better to do"" but, truth be told, ""This Means War"", while incredibly stupid and posing as an action film mixed with romance and buddy comedy, it turned out to be a reasonably suitable entertainment, based almost solely on the charisma, charm, and likability of its three leads. I disagree wholeheartedly with this idea that Reese Witherspoon was miscast as a girl these two handsome CIA covert ops guys would fight (and spy) over. I thought she was really sexy and sharp with the dialogue, and they really dressed her well; some fashionista had a grand ole time with Reese, and she looks mighty fine. Brushing the lust aside, I think partially in the back of certain people's minds is Reese as a mom in real life, but the ability of an actress is to convince us she could be that babe two studs would go out of their way to seduce and romance. I thought she was successful; I guess it depends on the viewer. Anyway, the action part of the plot consists of a heavy named Ivan (Mike Dopud), a device he had in his possession (they are able to secure for The Company), his brother's death, and revenge on his mind for said brother's demise. Because the operation ended with dead bodies, a bullet-ridden restaurant, and Ivan's brother's corpse landing through a car from a rooftop, agents, FDR (Chris Pine) and Tuck (Tom Hardy), are ""grounded"" by their superior, Collins (Angela Bassett, unfortunately wasted; she mostly has scenes barking rabidly at her boys for always screwing up). Trying to find something to replace their time out of the field, both wind up with a date, Lauren (Reese). Both are chance meetings and she finds herself stuck trying to determine which man is ""the one"". A subplot has Tuck a father and former flame, neither knowing of his true career, believing he is travel agent! The romance part of the plot is positively absurd. Covert operators like FDR and Tuck seem unable to just do things all nice and proper-like. Realizing Lauren is the one both of them had a nice date with the previous night, FDR and Tuck become rivals for her affections. Bugging her house (after entering her abode in silence, they search throughout hoping to learn more about her!), and listening in on her conversations, using their own CIA contacts and researching teams to learn personal details about Lauren, I think this will be considered offensive and morally dubious by many viewers as the methods of the agents is the very essence of ""invasion of privacy"". That said, this does provide moments where the boys listen intensely and intently in their ""CIA van"" as Lauren shared intimate conversations about them to her gal-pal bestie, Trish (Chelsea Handler; I read some rather unnecessarily cruel remarks by critics regarding her appearance, but I imagine she would just spit in their eye and tell them to f-off). Despite the role as a type of potty-mouth soccer mom, I thought Handler had some of the best lines, although her character's advice to Reese might be considered questionable, to say the least. The listening in on the conversations might also make some uncomfortable considering this intimate talk is not supposed to be material for the boys to use against each other. Thinking about that as I write that, I guess I understand why so many slung such vitriol towards it. In this day and age where information gathering has gotten out of control and has become amoral and questionably unlawful, such scenes might be considered wrong-headed. I don't think the intent was to elicit that response, but, just the same, this might be a detriment towards it. Still, the leads do everything in their power to diffuse the negativity, but I think despite their charms, it is a cause lost. The film rarely stays still, only allowing the romance to work as a chess game between the boys and their ""prize."" Reese, to her credit, is a prize worth fighting for (well, to me, but not hardly any of the critics, it seems), but the boys engaged in fisticuffs, going through windows of glass and tables of wood, at the end, is even a bit too preposterous for me to swallow. The part I got a good giggle at was the career of Lauren as a commercial products whiz, knowing exactly which fabric softer is the best, because it plays into the salvation of her boys at the end as a speeding SUV drives towards them (air-bag deployment knowledge comes in handy, we come to realize thanks to Reese's character). In all seriousness, this is fluff, maybe a bit dumb in its approach and foolhardy in how the spies spy to get ahead of each other to get the girl, but the leads play it to the hilt. It wasn't the success they all hoped, and McG's career as a director won't win him accolades due to his Hollywood tendencies, but, all in all, I found ""This Means War"" to be entertaining despite itself.",This Means War
6,zardoz-13,"Fast, Furious, Funny, but Contrived and Uneven",7,3 July 2012,"""Charlie's Angels"" director McG's ""This Means War"" qualifies as a fast but frivolous action romance epic with best buddy CIA agents Chris Pine and Tom Hardy vying for the affections of product testing guru Reese Witherspoon.Nothing about this outlandish thriller that has two secret agents gunning for a killer is remotely believable. They botch a mission during which they blow discretion to the wind and kill the chief villain's younger brother. The older brother, Heinrich (Til Schweiger of ""Inglourious Basterds"") vows to wreck vengeance on them. The villains are in Hong Kong when our heroes shoot it out with them in a high rise. Heinrich leaps off the skyscraper with a parachute, but his younger brother doesn't make it. Actually, he loses his parachute and smashes into the top of a car. Meantime, since they blew a covert mission, their female boss, Collins (Angela Bassett of ""Notorious"") puts them on leave, but this doesn't stop our heroes from keeping abreast of the bad guys. What does distract them more than they could have predicted their courtship of a beautiful single blond who has a show geared to testing products. Reese Witherspoon is currently without a man to the chagrin of her older best friend. Trish (Chelsea Handler of ""Cattle Call"") enters her friend, Lauren Scott (Reese Witherspoon), into an Internet Dating site, and our heroine meets Tuck (Tom Hardy of ""Layer Cake"") and they go out on a date. Tuck is divorced with an adorable son, and both his ex-wife and his son believe that he is a travel agent. Since Tuck hasn't been out on a date, his best friend FDR Foster (Chris Pine of ""Star Trek"") wants to help him. After Tuck and Lauren go their separate ways, FDR runs into Lauren at a video store. Most of the action takes place in Los Angeles, because few cities have video rental stores anymore since the advent of Netflix, Red Box, and Blockbuster On-Line. FDR manages to wrangle a date with her that starts badly because she sees him as a club rate. However, the date ends on a high note because Lauren runs into a sappy old boyfriend and his new wife and tries to one-up them with FDR. Initially, Lauren wanted to steer clear of FDR, but she owes him so they visit a pizza place and chat. FDR learns that Lauren moved from Atlanta to Los Angeles because she was in love with Steve (Warren Christie of ""Apollo 18"") but she caught him cheating on her.Things go to a different level when our desk-bound heroes show each other the new love of their lives. Imagine their surprise when Lauren's picture is looking back at them from opposing Dell lap-tops. At first, the guys vow to maintain a gentleman's agreement about what they do with Lauren. Predictably, before it is over, FDR and Tuck are at each other's throats over Lauren. These guys are the best that the CIA has and they would willingly take a bullet for each other. This changes drastically after they begin to date Lauren. They pull out all stops to learn what Lauren likes and hates and use the information to their fullest benefit. Lauren is floored by both guys, to the point that she breaks down and decides to sleep with them to see who fares best. Trish warns Lauren to pick the guy best for her instead of the best guy. Lauren finds this increasingly difficult because FDR and Tuck are using the best surveillance technology to find out the most about her that they can exploit to their advantage. Meanwhile, hovering the periphery is Heinrich looking at how he can even up the score.MG and his scribes don't let the action lag and he orchestrates some trigger-happy shoot-outs. The opening shoot-out in Hong Kong is as exciting as it is snappy. Pine and Hardy deliver first-rate performances. Just what a Brit is doing in the CIA is never addressed, while Reese Witherspoon looks out of place. She serves largely as attractive window dressing, while Pine and Hardy perform all the heavy lifting. The comedy in ""Role Models"" scribe Tony Dowling and ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" writer Simon Kinberg is more miss than hit. Some of their dialogue sounds pretty good. According to IMDb.COM, most of Chelsea Handler's dialogue was improvised. Uneven, contrived but occasionally funny and sweet, ""This Means War"" ranks as above-average despite its materialistic look.",This Means War
7,Boba_Fett1138,Entertaining for some but still annoying and bad to most.,5,22 March 2012,"To be honest, I always thought that this movie had some real potential in it. It at least sounded that way, when I learned about its premise of two CIA agents, almost literally, battling for the same girl, with their skills and tools. It was a good comedy premise, in my opinion, that however is poorly written and the movie still foremost remains a typical romantic-comedy, despite having an original and unusual concept to it.The whole concept sounded good, fun and interesting on paper but the execution of it is definitely lacking. First of all, the action just never blends in with any of its comedy or romantic aspects, which already makes this a very unbalanced movie. It's because the movie and its story is such a implausible one, that makes even less sense and makes you even more angry, the more you start thinking about it.It just never feels realistic that two friends, let alone two responsible CIA agents, would battle each other over one and the same girl, who isn't even all that special. I mean, I'm sorry, I like Reese Witherspoon and all but there is absolutely nothing about her or her character in this movie that makes you understand why these two guys are going through so much trouble for her.And is it supposed to be a romantic idea that two guys are abusing their positions and are giving all they got in their powers, to force a girl to fall in love with them? Because that basically is what they do. They spy on her, plant cameras in her house and whatever more, only to learn more about her and what she wants and is looking for in a guy. Nothing spontaneous or heartfelt about any of that, which also causes none of the romantic aspects to ever work out about this movie. As a matter of fact, it makes the movie quite awkward with some of its moments.You feel that this movie would had been a far better one if it had simply gone all out with its comedy. This movie would had been better if the comedy was more over-the-top. That way you wouldn't take this movie as seriously, as you are forced to do now at times.But it's also definitely due to it that the movie had been miscast, that nothing about this movie ever works out the way it was supposed to do. It is very obvious that neither Chris Pine or Tom Hardy was first choice. They weren't even second or third choice but eventually ended up getting the part, after it had been turned down by several other actors already. I have nothing against Chris Pine or Tom Hardy but these guys aren't really suitable for a movie of this sort. They can't handle comedy too well and besides don't have enough on screen chemistry with each other and the Reese Witherspoon character. You never really believe these guys are friends in the first place and you just also never really believe they are being madly in love with Reese Witherspoon's character.Perhaps thing could had been also spiced up a bit more if it featured an interesting side-plot. Something that involved a criminal plot for instance. After all, these guys are CIA agents but all we see them do is abuse all of their skills and technologies for the sake of courting a girl and sabotaging each other.There are still people out there who would find this something hilarious and entertaining to watch. I'm not looking down at those persons but I will say that most people will still be annoyed and perhaps even offended by this implausible movie, with a bad script and weak execution.5/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",This Means War
8,neil-476,"Clumsy romcom, but still some chuckles to be had",7,9 March 2012,"Arriving on screen somewhat battered by the critics, This means War tells of two young secret agents - American FDR (Chris Pine) and British Tuck (Tom Hardy) who, finding themselves with time on their hands after their last mission goes more public than anticipated, decide to develop their love lives and as luck - or, more precisely, plot machinery would have it, computer dating finds them both accidentally taking things up with Lauren (Reese Witherspoon). She in turn doesn't realise that they know each other and, conflicted, frequently talks things over with her dirty-minded best friend Trish (Chelsea Handler). Meantime, the two erstwhile buddies use the considerable resources at their command to sabotage the succession of dates they each embark on.The thing which struck me most about this movie was how mechanical it is. You can almost watch the machinery in motion as the plot is carefully engineered so as to have the parts in place for the next development, never more so than in the improbable sequence of events in the initial computer dating set up. And a secret service chief telling two agents ""You're grounded!"" Really? If more care had been taken to make the plot flow more naturally, and to soften some of the stupidity here, an element of credibility would have added immeasurably.Which is not to say that this is a dead loss. There is stuff here to enjoy. The action sequences are effectively staged, and Witherspoon's comedy credentials are well founded. Pine is likable and has a flair for comedy, while Hardy isn't and doesn't. But there are chuckles to be had along the way (the funniest part, for me, was when FDR was treating Lauren to a display of Klimt paintings and Tuck hijacked his audio feed).Incidentally, after years of straining my brain, I have finally figured out who Reese Witherspoon reminds me of: when she has a relaxed, closed-mouth smile, she looks exactly like Gizmo the Mogwai from Gremlins.",This Means War
9,Uriah43,Best Friends at War with Each Other,5,30 September 2018,"""FDR Foster"" (Chris Pine) and his best friend ""Tuck"" (Tom Hardy) are CIA field agents who are often deployed together on the same mission and are inseparable off-duty. However, their loyalty to one another begins to change when both become attracted to a woman named ""Lauren"" (Reese Witherspoon) who is equally attracted to both of them. Needless to say, being the competitive people that they are both FDR and Tuck decide to use every means at their disposal to win her affection while at the same time trying to squelch their friend's progress. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an okay romantic-comedy which had some good moments here and there. Unfortunately, the ending was somewhat predictable and the comedy was rather hit or miss as well. Likewise, there really wasn't much chemistry between any of them and for that reason I have rated this film accordingly. Average.",This Means War
10,ferguson-6,The only sparkle is in the eyes,3,19 February 2012,"Greetings again from the darkness. Well it's mid-February and the hope is that this is the worst movie I will sit through all year. It's a waste of talent and utterly senseless ... which would be fine if it happened to be funny. Somehow the writers and director manage to mash-up a spy thriller, action film, buddy film, and romantic comedy into something that is none of those and a slap in the face of the viewers.This one is directed by McG, whose first two theatrical films were Charlie's Angels and Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, both of which had more and better action sequences than this. It stars three very attractive people in Chris Pine, Tom Hardy and Reese Witherspoon. Their job is to continue to look attractive, sparkly eyes and all, in each progressively more absurd scene. Chelsea Handler is tossed in as Witherspoon's married friend, who doles out horrible and trashy dating advice in what sounds like a lousy stand-up comedy routine. Angela Bassett, a normally fine actress, is totally out of place in her couple of scenes as the must-be-angry boss. Til Schweiger (Inglourious Basterds) is the generic bad guy.The movie bookends two lackluster action sequences that make little sense and are not much to look at. In between, we have two best buddy co-worker spies competing for the affections of the same girl, who is taking advice from some nasty, jealous friend. All of that is done with little action, no suspense, minimal comedy and absolutely no logical sense. Did I mention that the three leads are all very attractive? One of the minor details that really irritated me was a scene in a giant video store where Pine and Witherspoon are debating the hierarchy of Hitchcock films. In and of itself, that would be fine. But this conversation takes place in front of a display of multiple copies of Hitchcock's ""The Lady Vanishes"". Multiple copies. Probably more copies than Amazon has in stock. Throw in an escalating series of outlandish dates, a multi-million dollar bachelor pad for Pine, buddy dialogue that makes Riggs & Murtaugh or Tango & Cash sound like Lincoln and Douglas.This is evidently supposed to be an action flick for chicks. There is gunfire and muscles coming from two attractive spies who both love the attractive woman who is desperate to be loved. This means flop.",This Means War
11,morrison-dylan-fan,"""War,huh,yeah What is it good for""",5,13 March 2012,"Having a few hours to go before I had to pick up some relatives from a near by coach station,I decided to have a look at the near by cinema and see what was on.Looking at the showing times,I discovered that what looked to be a really fun action comedy was about to start in 15 minutes,which led to me getting prepared to see what this type of wars really meansThe plot:After killing the brother of a Russian mobster,best friends and secret agents FDR Foster and Tuck start to wonder if they will ever find that ""one"" special girl.Deciding to get over his unease about the concept,Tuck decides to join an online dating site,where he is shortly matched to a stunning looking product testing girl called Lauren (who got put on to the site as a ""surprise"" gift from her friend.)Wanting to show support for his friend,in case the girl is a ""psycho"" FDR comes along to protect Tuck until he is given a signal that everything is going well with Tuck and his mystery girl.Looking round a DVD store,FDR ends up running into a woman who he becomes completely obsessed with,unbeknown-st to FDR the girl is actually Lauren,who due to having gotten Tuck to fall head over heels for her has made it that along with having to be prepared to fight an avenging Russian mobster.Tuck and FDR also have to fight to the very end until only one of them ends up with Lauren.View on the film:With the exception of a cleverly filmed extended scene where in one single shot the guys are shown to be planting hidden camera around Laurens house,director McG gets rid of any grit that he showed for his Terminator film,and instead replaces it with a style that makes it look like the actors are having the studio lights slammed into their faces.Despite the trailer suggesting an action packed rom-com,the film is surprisingly light on action moments,with the admittedly fun action scenes (including a short but sweet battle between the two main actors) being ones that are crying to be extended,and for the movie to have an at least mildly threatening villain.Seeing as the screenplay and the directing have a good number of flaws,the cast have to be praised for making this film much more fun than it could have been in lesser hands.Although he strangely has to keep repeating the chewy as toffee line ""I love you man"" every 10 minutes or so,due to the writers wanting to hammer it into peoples heads that these two guys do really care about each other, Chris Pine gives a good performance as the rebel FDR,who also compliments the wonderful smoothness of Tom Hardy.Along with the battling boys,Reese Witherspoon (whose family do not own the famous British Pub chain!) brings a fantastic sense of sass and kookiness to her performance of Lauren,who has to try and put up with all of the disruption caused at work,as FDR and Tuck spy for her affection.",This Means War
12,anaconda-40658,This Means War on Witherspoon!,4,4 May 2015,"This Means War (2012): Dir: McG / Cast: Reese Witherspoon, Chris Pine, Tom Hardy, Chelsea Handler, Til Schweiger: The title should be the attitude of anyone who has the misfortune of seeing this film. It is a romantic comedy about relationships and fighting for what matters. Unfortunately producers fought too hard to get this contrived tripe into release. Chris Pine and Tom Hardy play best friends who happen to be secret agents, and they both happen to be connected to the same woman. When they learn this, they decide to compete for her, which leads to them upstaging each other through deceit and using sabotage. The plot is preposterous and constantly jerks viewers around. McG is notorious for crazy action scenes. It worked in Terminator: Salvation but the two Charlie's Angels films are pathetic. This is formula driven crap that leads to a massive fight in a restaurant over a woman whose intelligence is limited to the very worst of blonde jokes. Witherspoon is a fetching actress who has done better films than this. Here she is torn between two males and will decide to sleep with both in order to make up her mind. That just render her the biggest dumb ass in the film, but Pine and Hardy are only a couple steps behind with their willingness to shell out their friendship over this. Chelsea Handler plays Witherspoon's vulgar mouthed advice giving friend who really should hear herself. Til Schweiger plays a villain that is about as threatening as the Cookie Monster. Well made film that addresses these dating sites, however it also means war on the intelligence of anyone with any good sense. Score: 4 / 10",This Means War

14,phd_travel,Light hearted and enjoyable,7,23 February 2012,Two secret agents who are best friends fall for the same woman.Read some bad reviews so I wasn't expecting much but it's actually quite funny and a pleasant diversion. There are not too many laugh out loud moments - there could have been more but it's generally cute and amusing throughout. The way they go after Reese is quite amusing and fun to watch the story unfold.There isn't a whole lot of chemistry between Reese and the leads but it doesn't matter the whole thing is quite farcical not some drama romance comedy combination. Reese is good for this kind of light hearted role - it's her forte. I don't like her in her heavier roles. She looks quite cute still though not beautiful. The male leads are adequate but not ideal. Tom Hardy isn't good looking enough or charming enough. Chris Pine looks like a caricature of himself - has something happened to him? Chelsea Handler as a wisecracking good friend of Reese is okay but not as funny as I'd expect her to be.There were some scathing reviews that should be discounted.

Based on a story by Timothy Dowling who with Simon Kinberg and Marcus Gautesen adapted it for the screen, the film in many ways seems like a parody of several film types - chick flick, espionage capers, buddy movies, and relationship studies. The fact that it throws these ideas all into one mixing bowl and comes out not only making sense but having fun doing so makes it well worth watching,Two best friend CIA agents - FDR (Chris Pine) and Tuck (Tom Hardy) - find themselves in competition for the affections of the same beautiful woman, Lauren (Reese Witherspoon), an attractive but chronically unattached product testor and facilitator for focus groups whose best friend Trish (the brilliantly funny Chelsea Handler) constantly urges Lauren to date - even if on the internet. FDR and Tuck are accustomed to using whatever means necessary to complete a mission, a trait that mentality has a tendency to enter into their personal lives and when they discover Lauren's dating blog (create by Trish), they're both on it. They enter into a gentleman's agreement that stipulates they not interfere with one other, allow Lauren to choose the best man for her, and walk away from Lauren if seeing her begins to affect the men's friendship. The agreement quickly degenerates into a one-ups-man-ship contest of epic proportions thanks to the men's competitive natures and the arsenal of government resources at their disposal. Oblivious to the rivalry and the high-tech circus going on around her, Lauren desperately tries to figure out which of the two men is right for her. The behavior patterns of FDR and Tuck help make the decision - that, and the fact that Tuck has a son by a girl he cannot forget, Katie (Abigail Spencer).This is a non-stop action film filled with moments of tenderness and hilarity and espionage tactics gone awry. The superb trio of actors is supported by Angela Bassett (don't blink or you'll miss her), Til Schweiger as the bad guy on a mission against CIA, and Rosemary Harris. In the end it is all fun and laughs and solid movie making. Grady Harp",This Means War
16,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: This Means War,6,19 February 2012,"This Means War is probably one of the most deliberately misunderstood film in McG's filmography, probably perhaps he's fallen out of favour with many, like in M Night Shyamalan's case, where everything they touch gets slammed for any reason. This film may seem like it's a ripe piece of romantic comedy, but it celebrates Bromance quit unabashedly in spy versus spy fashion, and is more of a trip down the brotherly love avenue than one about two best friends trying their utmost in getting the girl of their dreams while sabotaging the other's chances, as the trailer will have you hoodwinked.Chris Pine and Tom Hardy, two actors who are seeing their stock go up in Tinseltown recently, star as FDR and Tuck, two CIA operatives based in Los Angeles who are the best in the business (as always). They work well together in country and overseas, they track each other's movements, they cover each other's backs, in essence they know what the other stands for, and just how to provide support. For instance when Tuck decides to go meet up with a girl he knew from the internet, FDR is just around the corner in case his buddy meets up with a psycho and needs to bail. That's what best friends are for.Tuck meets consumer product test company CEO Lauren (Reese Witherspoon) whose trash talking friend Trish (Chelsea Handler) created an online profile for her in a dating site that Tuck used. They meet, they like each other, but for the sake of plot convenience has Lauren bump into the persistent FDR, where at first they never had any chance of hooking up if not for Lauren to save some face when her ex boyfriend and his fiancé come walking down the street. So begins the chase that you see in the trailer where the two men show off to each other the girl they are interested in wooing, except that the context was a little misplaced, with FDR at that point being but a little bit obnoxious about his pursuit of Lauren.Written by Timothy Dowling and Simon Kinberg from a story by the former and Marcus Gautesen, this is one of those narratives that you can whip up in 5 minutes on a computer program that automatically churns out screenplay with the input of certain keywords. Everything falls into place in very formulaic fashion from beginning right to the end, leaving little room for surprises or suspense. All the good gags can be found in the trailer, so don't hold your breath for something else to come up for laughs. It's entertainment boiled down to the lowest common denominator, so if you're in for something that's harmless and mindless, this will be it.Don't expect anyone to lose out too, given that this has its intent to be a mass appeal crowd pleaser and knows better than to insult either fan base. Moreover, it's likely the agent representatives of the two male stars would have negotiated screen time, and who triumphs over whom, and with ""Versus"" type films amongst two equals, it's all mapped out eventually such that everyone wins in the end - this is no spoiler, but a given. There's a deliberation in keeping a character under wraps from the any preview, but once this character appears, you'd have guess how it's all going to pan out, from who's ending up with whom and how everything got resolved. Still, there are the rare plus points. Technically there's a scene set up that weaved in and around Lauren's home while the two would be suitors independently infiltrates the place to set up a mother-load of bugging devices unknown to each other's presence, and you have to give credit for its meticulous planning and logistical set up for that one continuous tracking shot. The other point somehow boils down a little bit closer to home with the abuses civil servants find themselves getting into and caught. Both FDR and Tuck utilize national resources from million dollar drones to countless of colleague man hours simply to keep up with the shenanigans of the other camp, under the guise of surveying a potential person of interest, pardon the pun. If I were Director CIA, I'd have them all fired. While this is only a movie and shouldn't be taken seriously, I suppose who knows what goes on behind closed doors since there's no one watching the watchmen, and abuses like these can be exploited without anyone the wiser.Resse Witherspoon still doesn't convince me that she has romantic lead qualities to make two hunks fall so hard for her, while Chris Pine and Tom Hardy looked more comfortable playing their roles opposite each other than with Witherspoon, making the bromance very much more interesting that the double date romance it was supposed to be. Throw in the rote thrash talking character whose vulgar dialogues serve only to bring in cheap laughs, and it's no wonder why many will roll their eyes at McG, wondering if that's really necessary. Til Schweiger got terribly wasted as the token villain with no personality, no threat and no purpose, only as fodder for our heroes to brush aside with ease.That said, this is ultimately a film targeted at the Valentine's Day weekend crowd, so make love, not war. A lightweight date film that's perpetually stuck at first gear.",This Means War
17,KineticSeoul,It's a decent movie that couples don't really have to sacrifice anything to watch,6,9 April 2012,"I don't get why this movie wasn't released on Valentine's day cause it's actually a alright movie. I wouldn't call it amazing movie but it was good for a first view. I been seeing some horrible reviews about this movie and went in with very low expectations. Maybe that was the case but I found myself actually enjoying this movie. Some people complained the trailer to this is much better than the movie itself, but I thought this movie brought exactly what this movie is from the trailer. I was expecting a raunchy/slapstick comedy with some romance elements thrown in with also action and that is what I got out of this. The premise is about two agents that go on some crazy missions fall for the same girl and thus although they like each other they set up a deal for the best man for the girl to get the girl. But things don't entirely go that way. And when it comes to the spies or agents one is a playboy and the other is a sensitive guy that wants to be in a real relationship. The comedy is alright and I found myself chuckling few times although the chemistry seemed a bit forced and not believable. In fact the bromance elements were more believable than the romance with the female partner. Despite the movie being entertaining sometimes this movie does have quite a bit of flaws. The whole premise is super absurd, it's okay for some movies to not be believable but some parts were just outrageous like doesn't make any sense kind of way. Every character in this movie is crazy to the point you can't really relate with any of them unless your a stalker or constantly two time people during what is suppose to be a relationship. There is nothing that stands out about the villain and the romance elements are the weakest here. Maybe it's because it has two guys going after one girl like those ""Twilight"" movies except not as bad. Anyways this movie has elements that guys and girls can enjoy even as a couple, so no one is really sacrificing anything while watching this. This movie is sort of like ""Mr. n Mrs. Smith"" when it comes to the humor and action, especially when it comes to the action. But this one is a bit more absurd and the characters don't make much sense sometimes. It's not a great couple action movie but it's a passable combination of both.6.5/10",This Means War
18,Hellmant,Would have been better if they were fighting over Natalie Portman!,8,22 April 2012,"'THIS MEANS WAR': Four Stars (Out of Five) Highly entertaining Action/Romantic Comedy/Buddy Film from director McG. The film was written by Timothy Dowling, Simon Kinberg and Marcus Gautesen and features Tom Hardy and Chris Pine as two best friend CIA agents who fall for the same woman (played by Reese Witherspoon). The movie is an equal mix of action, comedy and romance and does an impressive job of balancing all three genres. It's stars Hardy and Pine that really make the movie work though.Hardy plays Tuck and Pine plays FDR Foster, the two top CIA operatives, who are also best friends. They're after a master criminal named Heinrich (Til Schweiger) who's also after them. Tuck is a divorced father who's really looking to find someone special again. After opening a dating site profile he meets Lauren (Witherspoon) and the two immediately hit it off. Lauren then also meets Foster, a ladies man, who is drawn to Lauren. When the two realize they're both seeing the same woman they decide to let the best man win and let her choose between them. Neither can help not using their CIA skills to try and one-up each other though. Things get extremely competitive and creepy.The film is yet another case of looks prejudice. Due to the fact that the two leads are both pretty boys their behavior isn't seen as creepy even though they're seriously stalking someone. It's played off as harmless lighthearted comedy and their actions are portrayed as acceptable because they're good looking. Cast two unattractive guys in the same roles and the film would come off as extremely creepy. Still Hardy and Pine are both great in the leads and the movie is very amusing. It is a good Buddy Film. I think the movie could have used a better lead actress than Witherspoon but she's passable (despite seeming a little too old for the two male leads). I think it would have been better if they were fighting over Natalie Portman. Still an entertaining Buddy Movie!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGrfCmtiWW0",This Means War
19,thesar-2,This Means Bore,3,3 March 2013,"How in the hell of war was Katherine Heigl not the lead here? This was HER movie!Wow it's been a very long time since I've seen such a train wreck on screen. Okay, sure, my track record for higher star'red films isn't great as of late, but damn, Director McG's This Means War has to be one of the worst movies I've seen in a very long time.Everything was wrong here. One can even go back, before the feature was released to the false advertising of the ""ACTION-PACKED, romantic love-triangle"" angle. There was more action in the 2-minute trailer than the entire movie. Fine. Was it at least a romantic comedy? Not really, since romantic involves chemistry and comedy ensures laughter.But I don't judge a movie on the advertiser who should be on trial for perjury. While watching, it became clear that the intent was 99.9995% slapstick comedy and the remainder involved action.Oh, I said everything was wrong, and only established the genre. Here were some of my thoughts:While the concept is far from original – they weren't trying for Oscars – this ""LIE"" movie offered zero freshness in the 20,000-year-old plot of ""boy(s) lies to get girl during contest boy(s) fall for girl girl learns of lie(s) & leaves boy(s?) get girl to live happily ever after.""Reese, a soon-to-be-former favorite of mine was lost, distracted, shallow and phoned everything in. Sad.The dialogue was horrendous, the attempts at humor sad and the connection between the leads lost.The film lacked conviction in the fact it wanted to be raunchy, and even included some(gasp) harsh language!, but it never ever pulled the trigger.One couple thought a 2-minute first date was sufficient and seconds later, the other couple met at a video store? In the present?All characters were despicable, even the secondary ones, leaving NO ONE to root for.The minuscule amount of action was inane, but then again McG.When the better (and that's saying a lot in this mess) scene of a finger-painting sabotage is followed up by an attacking puppet dog, you know the mentality of the writers.The villain has a piece of cloth and uses that to track his new nemesis(s). REALLY?And above all else, the finale was silly, poorly constructed, absurd, incredibly, yet mercifully, short and all-but stolen (from Lethal Weapon 3's PRE-climactic scene. They didn't need to use that scene as their finale, but This Means War ran so far out of steam by that point, they had no other roads to travel, literally.)Do I have time, or do you care for the synopsis? Two heterosexual males in love with both each other and themselves find time to love the same female and use their CIA jobs to illegally and unethically spy on her while they bet one will land her first without breaking their own non-gay bond.While I do applaud the men and characters showing that two men, can, in fact, be enormously close without being lovers, they kinda went overboard. I got it: they weren't gay or in sexual love for each other, but move on once established.This movie was a mess from beginning to end and not funny or original enough to give any kind of recommendation. Skip it.",This Means War

21,bowmanblue,"Dumb, silly and strangely enjoyable",7,13 May 2014,"This Means War is the oldest tale: two men fight for the attention of a beautiful woman. However, this time, the two men in question happen to be the new Captain Kirk and the new Bane from Batman and they're vying for the affections of that chick from Legally Blonde. Unfortunately, neither man use phasers, photon torpedoes or terrorist plots to sack an entire city, but they do make for an interesting pair of combatants - namely because they're both best friends who happen to work for the CIA (incidentally, everyone in the CIA looks like a supermodel - you probably didn't know that).This means that there are gadgets and underhand techniques aplenty in their mission to generally do each other down and stab each other in the back.This all takes place in a strange world filled with primary colours where everything looks like the inside of a Barbie doll's house (plus in this world a girl who looks like Reece Witherspoon can't actually get a date). There are some brief battles and even a minor car chase to keep the action junkies in their zone, but, primarily, this is a love (triangle) story and, if I'm honest, it's not a bad one.This Means War is stupid, predictable, dumb, but strangely quite endearing and I found myself even laughing out loud in some places.I think the film could be described as a 'date movie' as it's a good one to watch with a lady. And, if I ever stop sitting on the sofa watching DVDs and take a girl out, I may just show her this film.And, just as a side note, why do both leading men look like they're wearing lipstick?

23,g-bodyl,"Give Me A Break, Critics!",8,4 August 2013,"This Means War, while not the best film in the world, is a good date-night comedy that couples would enjoy. Critics had no mercy for this film and they bashed it with all they got. Over the years, I've learned not to trust critics, but my own gut feeling. I'm glad I did because I found this film to be funny and just a good film in general. Yes, there are some flaws but then again, what movie doesn't have flaws?McG's film is about two best friends who are also CIA agents. Their friendship get tested when they both fall in love with the same girl. Now, they start a competition against each other to see who will win the girl.I hear many complaints about Reese Witherspoon being too old for this kind of movie, but I threw these complaints out the window. She still looks great and I think she did a good job. Chris Pine and Tom Hardy are good with all their bickering and use of expensive CIA equipment against each other.Overall, this is a good rom-com that will satisfy both genders. The males will appreciate the action scenes more whilst the females will no doubt like the romance. This film works well in my eyes and I wouldn't mind seeing it again. I wish critics would stop thinking every film has to be ""The Godfather"" or ""Shawshank Redemption."" This is just a solid date night or popcorn film. I rate this film 8/10.",This Means War

26,tabuno,An Uneven Mix of Action and Dating Comedy,7,14 August 2019,"This Means War (2012). Starring Reese Witherspoon, Chris Pine, and Tom Hardy this fascinating fusion of espionage, action, and comedy brings to the screen a dating two men dilemma in a thriller format. While competent enough, the attempt to offer the audience big action thrills while at the same time balancing the antics of two men fawning for the same woman diffuses the smart focused energy of each of these major movie genres on screen. Another problem that develops is the rather questionable ethical scheming that occurs and who Witherspoon's character eventually attaches herself to. Contrast The Hitman's Bodyguard (2017), The True Memoirs of an International Assassin (2016), Red (2010), Mr. and Mrs. Smith (2005), The Matador (2005) or even The Long Kiss Goodnight (1996) where these espionage comedies incorporate relational themes as a secondary, accompanying screen time experiences. Perhaps the best cover action thriller with a twist of humor is to be found in Killing Eve (2018).",This Means War
27,ironhorse_iv,"This means war, honestly means awful.",5,22 May 2014,"I'm mad about this Spy Vs Spy movie. Directed by McG, the romantic comedy spy film is just blatantly sexist, barf-inducing movie. The movie is about two CIA agents, Tuck Hansen (Tom Hardy) and Franklin 'FDR' Foster (Chris Pine) who are best friends whom discovered that they are dating the same woman, Lauren Scott (Reese Witherspoon) forcing a childish immature love triangle. Each man takes turns trying to ruin the other man's date using high-tech spying and weaponry in unfunny ways. That's our tax dollars, people! We've paying for two guys trying to cock-block each other. Also, neither of them face serious consequences for their wasting of government property. Chris Pine's character comes off as an arrogant womanizer that seem no different than his recent previous roles. It's nothing new. It's just while 2009's Star Trek, James T. Kirk had some strengths and some morals limits. This guy had none and you felt it. He totally lied to her about everything from his interests on, to low trick to make her have pity for him. This character is just slimy. Tom Hardy seem out of place, as the supposedly normal likable guy. Honestly, this actor is a great character actor, and he seem limited as hell in this role. Badly miscast. Also, what type of spy join a social network site when people trying to kill him, to find love, anyways? James Bond, he isn't. Reese Witherspoon's character is less of a person, and more like a prize, whom Reese had to act so dumb that she couldn't see the creepiest that both men are showing, throughout the film. Also, she just as unlikeable, with seeing both guys behind each other' backs the whole time without telling them and using them for eye candy in front of her ex. What a two-timer! She makes really bad shallow decisions throughout the film that is so irritating. Wow, who knew stalking and invasion of privacy could be so ""romantic""? This whole concept is creepy as hell. This movie was no 1996's True Lies with a similar premise. The different between James Cameron's True Lies and this movie is that the main character has a reason to spy on her, because he has a feeling that she was cheating on him. Franklin 'FDR"" Foster and Tuck Hansen has no reason to, because both know each other are dating her, and one of them, even tries to back down so the other could date her. The movie feels like a movie that was really trying to Rated R, but was shoehorn into being PG-13 with its sex humor. A lot of this unfunny humor comes from supporting character, Trish (Chelsea Handler) who for the most part of the film is annoying as hell. There is a lot of extended cuts of just Trish spitting out the worst guidance. Glad, they cut most of her scenes out. There is also additional spy gigs that were delete. An extended cut consists of the 'fake family scene', in which Tuck Henson pays a few actors to play his family in order to impress Lauren was one of them. It was a bit awkward for PG-13. There's a lot of weird dark Patriot Act humor in this movie as well. Such in the case of the torture scene, in which the two main guys torture a guy, while talking about how they will win, over Lauren. WTF!? It's just as bad, as shooting a drone scene. Honestly, the only time, I really did laugh was the paintball scene. The action scenes are some of the worst. The shots are cut too fast as you can barely see what is happening. The worst had to be the car chase scene toward the end, where the editing was just below standards with jump cut from scenes in a parking lot to scenes in a freeway settling. There is reasons for that, as the movie cut a lot of scenes for test screenings or scenes being too gross or dark, with one being a scene at the abandoned warehouse. The movie release has three different alternate endings: either Lauren choosing neither; Lauren choosing FDR or Lauren choosing Tuck. I wish, there was a version of Lauren choosing to die. That's the version, I like to see. The movie had a number of rewrites. At one time, the film was tailored for two African-American comic actors. It was full of offending ridiculous urban slang. I'm at less, glad, the script is not as bad as it used to be. Overall: It was just a poor excuse of an action romantic comedy. Not worth the watch, unless you got nothing else to watch. It was terrible. Watch 1997's True Lies. That one work the concept better.",This Means War

29,The-Sarkologist,Typical Rubbish I would expect from Hollywood,3,29 July 2012,"It is interesting to note the review that I read on this film about the writer not understanding why the critics hated this movie when he, and the audience he was with, loved it. Well, while I am not a paid critic or film reviewer, I will have to say that I pretty much hated this movie. I thought the whole concept of two CIA agents abusing their privileges to stalk a girl that they both liked was ridiculous, and the fact that they actually get away with it borders on the really concerning.I really don't know about the United States, but here in Australia stalking is illegal and can land you up with a gaol term. Also, using resources to check up on somebody for your own personal interests is not only illegal, but unethical. The question that I then ask is whether people's right to privacy have been taken away to the point that if a CIA agent wants to track some woman because of some desire to have sex with her then he can? If that is the case then I guess all of the right-wing conspiracy theorists are actually correct because it seems that nothing is sacred.Of course there is also the girl whom the director plays as a stereotypical dumb blonde. That, personally, is insulting and to be honest, quite sexist as well. Personally a woman who drags two guys along because she cannot make up her mind as to who she really wants to date is not really a woman that I am interested in. Further, the fact that two friends are at each others throats over a single girl is just pathetic (though I must admit that it does happen). However since she actually chose one of them, thus leaving the (in my opinion) better man out in the cold just wasn't a satisfying ending (even though the better man got back together with his estranged wife).Okay, you might argue that it is just a movie, but seriously, when has that argument actually held any water? Time and time again I hear people referring to Hollywood movies as lessons in life, right up until somebody like me points out the holes and the flaws in these movies (as well as the incredible moral ambiguity that surrounds them) at which point they simply say 'it is only a movie'. Seriously people, make up your minds. Are you going to use Hollywood movies as moral guideposts because if you are, please don't hide behind the pathetic excuse of 'its only a movie' because if you are, stop using them as moral guideposts.",This Means War

They battle each other through the use of creative dates, basic wooing and the occasional fist fight. In conjunction to this, a villainous villain is busy being a villain by seeking vengeance for his brother's death...in a villainous way. The love triangle and CIA subplot really do not blend, the only similarities it details is that the two guys are colleagues. Great. Needed that information. The action sequences were shot well with both Tom Hardy and Chris Pine suitable for their roles, but it's just not exhilarating at all. It's fluff, a big ball of Reese Witherspoon belly button fluff that she occasional fiddles with whenever she desires to do a mediocre romantic comedy. Hardy is ""oh hello, gosh, I'm British and I love a good cup of tea. Let's drink and reminisce over good times love? whereas Pine is ""hey...yeah, I'm cool...love women, know everything about them"".

33,BeneCumb,Two Bond-clowns and a desperate blondie...,5,31 January 2013,"It is always harder to create a comedy with thriller, romance, and parody combined - or if you do, one should clearly prioritize these elements. This Means War aimed to spotlight the topics above in an equal way - and mostly failed. Well, there are some bright moments, but the bigger part is predictable and unlikely (especially the crimes scenes and those before the very end, which could have been presumed). And what about infringement of privacy, abuse of government property, justification of faking, neglecting of jobs, among other things? Not good examples to be distributed and encouraged...As for the cast/characters, female ones were much more deliberated and interesting to follow: Reese Witherspoon and Chelsea Handler, above all. Thomas Hardy has had better performances; speaking of Chris Pine, I have never understood his popularity - ""cute"" model look does not always contribute to good acting skills.Thus, for admirers of Pine and Hardy, the movie is quite good probably, for the rest - skip it easily. On the other hand, its box office has been oddly good.",This Means War
34,DarkVulcan29,I never imagined that a romantic spy comedy could be so bland.,4,18 February 2012,"This Means War dares to call itself a comedy, but the more it tries, it fails big time. Instead of laughing, I was left feeling puzzled, Made me ask,""What where they smoking""?Two best friends (Tom Hardy and Chris Pine) who are CIA agents. In there personal lives, Each one meet a special woman, much to there surprise it's the same woman, and she is played by Reese Witherspoon. They both do everything underhanded to win her affection, using spy gadgets. But who will she choose, and will there friendship survive?The only reason I'm not giving this a lower rating is because the chemistry between Tom Hardy and Chris Pine is very strong, I instantly bought there bromance, but neither one had no chemistry with Reese Witherspoon. Reese Witherspoon is the biggest disappointment here, she usually plays characters with some interest, but here she has no interest, makes me wonder why these two agents would fight for her. And Chelsea Handler is just being herself, nothing more, she is a female David Spade. Action scenes are alright, nothing spectacular. If you want a better action romantic comedy, then rent Knight and Day instead.",This Means War
35,freemantle_uk,An awful rom-com with sub-par action scenes,2,9 August 2013,"From the director of the Charlie's Angels films and the writer of films like xXx: State of the Union and X-Men: The Last Stand, comes an awful rom-com with tacked on mediocre action scene in an attempt to please everyone, but ends up pleasing no one.Tuck (Tom Hardy) and FDR (Chris Pine) are CIA field officers who forced into desk jobs in Los Angeles after a mission goes wrong in Hong Kong. Tuck is longing for a relationship after being shot down by his ex-wife and meets Lauren Scott (Reese Witherspoon), a product tester, on a dating website. But Lauren also meets FDR and she dates both men at time, leading to Tuck and FDR to use CIA resources to get information on Lauren and stop each other, forgetting a dangerous weapons dealer, Heinrich (Til Schweiger) wants revenge.Let's make no bones about this film, This Means War is very bad, a horrible waste of the talents of its actors. As a comedy it unfunny, with poor jokes and the only two times I chuckled was at the expense of FDR who is a complete egoist. For a film that is meant to be an action-comedy the action is too few and far between and shot too close and edited too quickly. It is a crying shame that the best action scene is when Tuck dominates a paintball battle and it was a scene that had some comic potential.This Means War is a very sloppily written, it is a weak rom-com with an action/spy plot that was treated as an afterthought. FDR was made out to be complete narcissist who only cares about himself and the number of women he can bed. He simply wears Lauren down to go on a date with her before finding out Tuck was going out with her. Yet FDR is the one who has 'character grown' and a big SPOILER, he gets the girl! Hardy has the better role of being the nice, safe guy, but he is basically the perfect man and they should have been no question in Lauren's mind. Yet his character is made British for no real reason excuse to make some bad jokes. It does not make any real sense that he works for the CIA. We don't even get a throw away line like he is on loan from MI6 or he is American but raised in Britain.The most annoying character was Lauren's friend played by Chelsea Handler who was just grating as she was trying to be as vulgar as possible. I just wanted her to shut up! Because of the setting within the CIA, Tuck and FDR use CIA resources to monitor Lauren, including background checks, bugging her house, placing GPS trackers, tapping her phones, using spy drones, the usual spy stuff. This is comedy, this is very creepy: even a better action comedy, True Lies had this problem. It is hard to route for any character when they use this information to score with Lauren. And Lauren doesn't seen to question how these men suddenly know they faults and counter them. This is a film where no one in the CIA questions why FDR and Tuck are monitoring a seemingly harmless woman and waste manpower on her. A spy drone even gets blown up over a race track in LA and that would be a great time to question what they are doing: but that never happens. I personally would have loved to have seen a twist was FDR and Tuck dicked about with CIA resources so much that a terrorist attack happens on their watch.The jokes in the script are weak, McG's direction does not help as he allows jokes and scenes to linger. There is no snap to the directional or the comedy and it was just lazy. The best moment of his direction comes as a long continuous shot when FDR and Lauren enter a club, but that is it. McG has no ability with comedy.This is a just an awful film that at least Hardy and Pine have recovered from. The script and the direction is are dreadful and This Means War is basically a film made by committee. They are better ways to deal with this material: there is the already mention dark comic twist about the consequences of Tuck and FDR's actions. The film could have focused on one CIA agent who finds the love of his life but has to keep his profession from her. Or they is a dark drama about a CIA agent being obsessive and control and does everything he can to keep his girlfriend, with the girlfriend having nowhere to turn.If you want a good action-comedy just watch True Lies or RED.",This Means War
36,estebangonzalez10,My new guilty pleasure,8,19 March 2012,"¨It's spy against spy.¨ This Means War is a really silly and predictable film, but I had a great time with it thanks to the excellent cast. Tom Hardy, Chris Pine, and Reese Witherspoon are great actors, and they prove it in this film in which they turn mediocre material into an extremely fun film. I couldn't stop laughing while seeing Tom Hardy in action. He is one of my favorite actors and you can hardly recognize him in most of his films. I never expected to see him in a rom-com like this, and I usually hate most of these predictable and painfully unfunny films, but This Means War is the exception. It could be my new guilty pleasure, considering it did get trashed by most of the critics. Everyone in the theater I saw it with was laughing hysterically, so I guess I wasn't the only one. This film was directed by McG, the man who brought the Charlie's Angels to the big screen, and this might be my favorite film of his (although that isn't saying much because I pretty much hated his other movies). The screenplay was written by Timothy Dowling and Simon Kinberg. It isn't really funny, but the actors make the movie and the jokes better. I guess Chelsea Handler wrote all her lines herself because it sounded like the advice she would truly give her friends on TV. I wasn't too much of a fan of her character, but the rest of the cast made the film for me. I knew everything that was going to happen, even the twist at the end, but that didn't ruin the film one bit; it was seeing Hardy in this role I'd never think I'd see him in that made this such a pleasant experience. Witherspoon and Pine held their par as well. This is no Lethal Weapon, but it still was entertaining.FDR Foster (Chris Pine) and Tuck (Tom Hardy) are spies working for the CIA. After their latest assignment blows out of proportions and leaves several people dead, their boss takes them off the field and assigns them to office duties only. FDR and Tuck were made for the field, so life in the office grows increasingly tedious for them. Besides working together, they are great friends. FDR is a ladies' man; he is good at hitting on girls and having one night stands with them, while Tuck has a harder time finding a woman after his latest marriage failed. He does have a six year old son named Joe. Tuck decides to try his luck on a dating website so he publishes his picture and description hoping he can meet a nice girl. Lauren (Reese Witherspoon), who left Atlanta for a man that later left her for another woman, is now an independent working woman who hasn't really dated anyone seriously after being dumped. Her best friend, Trish (Chelsea Handler), places a profile of her on the dating website without her permission. When Lauren finds out she ends up seeing Tuck's picture in the site and decides to give it a try. The date goes well, but later Lauren runs into FDR who also makes a move on her (having not realized that she is the girl Tuck is dating). Both FDR and Tuck realize they're dating the same woman and decide to compete for her without letting her know they know each other. They make a gentleman's agreement and don't think this situation will harm their friendship one bit, but what will happen when both men fall for her?The story is pretty simple and we've seen it before, but it's the actors that make the movie so much fun. I focused mainly on the romantic triangle because that is the center of the movie, although there is a pretty ridiculous side plot dealing with a villain named Heinrich (Til Schweiger), but that story doesn't do much for the film really. I guess they placed it there to keep some of the guys interested and have some action scenes, although the scenes are really cartoonish and dumb. The fun in this film isn't trying to guess who Lauren will choose, but really seeing these two men fighting each other and trying to boycott each other's date. Pine and Hardy are two excellent action stars, but I hadn't seen them in this sort of role before and they were great in it. I laughed at most of the goofy moments, and I can see how so many critics hated it, but I can also see why so many people got a kick out of this movie as well. This Means War isn't a memorable film, it won't win any awards, but it is an entertaining movie and an interesting option for a date movie. I really had a blast with this film; my new guilty pleasure.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",This Means War
37,r96sk,One not to be taken seriously,7,21 February 2020,"'This Means War' is a fun enough film, one not to be taken seriously.I enjoyed all three of the lead performers, though Tom Hardy does feel awkward in parts where the stronger chemistry between Reese Witherspoon and Chris Pine comes to the fore. The thing that lets this one down, though, is the Heinrich storyline, which is utterly pointless.",This Means War
38,juneebuggy,Completely forgettable and disappointing,5,11 October 2014,"When I first saw the trailers for this it looked like it would be a pretty good movie. When I managed to catch it on TV however I was disappointed. This Means War is not particularly funny or romantic or action packed, its just average on all counts.Chris Pine and Tom Hardy play two of the world's deadliest CIA operatives best friends and inseparable as partners, until they discover that they've fallen in love with the same woman, then all bets are off.Pine and Hardy are definitely nice to look at and have good chemistry together but I had a real hard time believing that they'd be fighting over an ageing Reese Witherspoon -sorry but she's just too old for this role even though she did a decent enough job. Chelsea handler was quite funny as her cocktail wielding BFF and there were a few fun moments but a completely forgettable movie.",This Means War
39,davispittman,Good cast and a very fun film,8,7 February 2016,"This means war starring Reese Witherspoon, chris pine and Tom Hardy is a really fun movie overall. The cast is great in their roles and the script is funny, romantic and had its moments of action. Witherspoon was a great choice for the lead role, she's a lovable and tough confident woman. Chris Pine is one of my favorites, for both his acting and his sinful good looks. He plays the guy who is sensitive underneath but has an outer look of a playboy. Tom hardy is the sexy English guy who is very sweet but isn't quite as ""fun"" as chris pine. I really liked the chemistry between both her and Pine and her and hardy. Of course I won't reveal who ends up together at the end but I was satisfied. Also, another very funny part of the film is Reese's best friend Chelsea handler. I absolutely loved her character!! She has hilarious lines and it works so well because she's a natural comedian. The action is fun and pretty over the top at times, which worked. Overall it's one of my favorites just because of how much fun I have while watching it. 8/10 for This Means War! Very much recommended.",This Means War
40,3xHCCH,Very Entertaining Action-Comedy,8,20 March 2012,"First of all, the poster with the three stars was quite striking. Chris Pine I have not seen in anything since ""Star Trek."" Tom Hardy is in a lot of big movies since he broke into the big time in ""Inception."" Reese Witherspoon is always the perky favorite rom-com girl. It was a very promising casting to say the least! I had to see what this was about.The intense opening sequence tells us that Frank (Pine) and Tuck (Hardy) are CIA operatives and good friends. Lauren (Witherspoon) is a consumer goods quality researcher. Through an online dating site, Lauren meets up with Tuck. And by sheer chance, later she also meets Frank in a video store. The two men discover they were dating and falling in love with the same girl, and she is falling for both of them! This results in a mad-cap game of no-holds-barred oneupmanship as the two guys both use their over-the-top spy tricks in order to get on the better side of Lauren.The three stars all had great chemistry with each other which makes the movie fun to watch. The banter between Pine and Hardy was electric and energetic. The character of Lauren's sex-obsessed friend Trish (Chelsea Handler) is blunt and hilarious. The respective staff of the two guys were also very funny as they loyally spied for their respective bosses. This film has varied scenes of action, comedy and romance which will keep both men and women entertained. Fun! I think you will all have a good time watching this. There is definitely something for everyone to enjoy here.",This Means War
41,adamjohns-42575,It loses points for a lack of nudity!,9,30 July 2021,"Tom Hardy is just divine in this film. I love Chris Pine too, but it's Tom that wins here, maybe every time actually. They seem to have used a filter that makes all of their eyes bright and gorgeous, but they really needn't have bothered.It's a film for basically everyone! It was released on Valentines Day with the intention of being the perfect date film and I really think it works like that. It's enough romantic comedy and enough action film with jokes that everyone can enjoy and has a good story.I would have liked a different ending for Tom. That's not a spoiler. It's just a personal preference. Actually the perfect ending for me would have been Tom turning up in my bed! Alas that didn't happen :-(869.91/1000.",This Means War
42,Sherazade,Cringeworthy!!!!!!!!,3,20 July 2012,"I cannot believe that I was actually looking forward to seeing this film, the trailer was so misleading. I could tell within the first five minutes that I was gonna dislike it when to two male leads (played by Tom Hardy & Chris Pine) wound up on a convert mission in Hong Kong and remnants from that botched affair turns out to be something that would drag on throughout the course of the film. All of this made worse with the introduction of Reese Witherspoon's spunky yet unlucky in love character (yeah that's believable that such an attractive woman would suffer for a date) and her sidekick, a potty-mouthed BFF play by TV personality Chelsea Handler --their saga makes up the remainder of the film. Am I in shock that this was a flop at the box office, no. Hardy & Pine were fine (no pun intended) but when you are using dated material that has been done in the past and done even better by far less talented actresses maybe you should think about casting...I dunno someone who has not won an Academy award for instance? Okay, okay before I get into that let me give Witherspoon some credit for holding her own opposite Handler who is supposed to be a comedian but is not funny at all. In scenes where Handler's character was telling jokes, Witherspoon came across as the authentically funny one. Back to the issue of casting....de-glam versions of Blake Lively, Amanda Seyfried or even Lauren London would have been perfect for this role. Cameron Diaz would have said no to this script even Kirsten Dunst would have also said no. Who am I kidding? Even Emma Stone would have passed on the script. After seeing Witherspoon in 'How do you know?' 'Just like Heaven' and now this, the routine quite frankly has gotten tired. An Oscar-winner should never dabble in such fluff.Poor Angela Bassett was wasted in a stereotypical supporting role.",This Means War
43,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,This Means War (2012),6,13 June 2012,"You can easily see the initial appeal of this film. With a good mixture of comedy, romance, and action, it seems like the perfect date movie for those couples that subscribe to gender genres. Something for the girls and something for the boys. This Means War has two CIA agents battling for the affections of the same woman. It all starts out innocently enough, but when Reese declares a sex ""tie breaker"" I lost all respect for her. Had the genders been switched, this movie would've had a completely different ending. Pine plays FDR, the womanising cool cat that originally sees this as a sport. Hardy is the sensitive guy with a son and a failed marriage. He has genuine feelings for the girl. They start to spy on Witherspoon, which gives them insights into how their dates went, and Pine learns to be a bit more sensitive whilst Hardy lets loose with his more cavalier side. I really didn't feel much chemistry between Witherspoon and either of the lads, but this may be because Pine and Hardy had such fantastic chemistry. I never once doubted their friendship and feel this should have been the true focus. They did bromance without making us doubt their masculinity. There's also a plot involving Schweiger's evil German coming for revenge after the boys kill his brother in the beginning, but this is just for a quick and convenient action ending that can wrap things up. The comedy is very gentle but does manage a few chuckles. The romance is sweet at times but also ruined by a certain air of creepiness from the boys and bitchiness on Witherspoon's part, and the action is very well handled but also very far apart. For a lot of people the biggest thrill will be seeing who WItherspoon ends up with. Simple and competent but like so many spy comedies, it just needed some balls.",This Means War
44,Seraphion,Fortunately it's just a movie,4,4 September 2014,"The story kind of begins quite convincingly to get the action part going. But it turns to be kind of lame as the transition to the introduction of Reese Whitherspoon's character is made so bluntly. There's no real balance between the action and the comedy. And having that the comedy doesn't fare really good just makes this movie a near miss of an entertainment. The movie tries so hard to be funny, but I don't really get the laugh anywhere on this movie. Well, the concept of state intelligence agents using the agency's resources for their own gain is quite dangerous for me, fortunately this is just a movie. Despite the poor screenplay and directing, I quite enjoyed the acting. Chris Pine and Tom Hardy did quite well portraying the pop culture perspective of intelligence agents. It's quite a shame that they both don't have the same height. Reese Witherspoon did also quite nice, although I must say that she never quite get the comedy in her scenes to be funny here.",This Means War

46,bob-rutzel-1,Somewhat Okay,4,27 May 2012,"Two CIA agents and best friends want to court Lauren (Reese Witherspoon). They agree to a gentlemen's agreement to play fair, but you just know that's not going to happen.The courting is fine, but there is something else going on: these agents are after a big Russian spy at the same time and in the same city. After the first 5-minutes when the two CIA agents run up against the Russian spies, I became concerned about this movie because after that encounter, all I heard was lame dialogue and witnessed some very awkward moments among the main characters. Guess the director didn't notice. About to shut it down, I reached for the remote, and then the movie straightened out and it became a somewhat okay movie. Somewhat is the operative word. I was thinking (ok, hoping) this would be on the order of another Mr and Mrs Smith or at the very least another Killers (yes, a very bad title for a comedy) both Romcoms with spies. Well, this was not as good as those movies but it has its moments. Agent FDR (Chris Pine) and Agent Tuck (Tom Hardy) use their own junior CIA agents to spy on Lauren telling those agents it's all for national security. Of course, Lauren doesn't know that FDR and Tuck know each other. And, for a time FDR and Tuck do not know that both are after the same woman. Let the games begin. We see some loopy and sneaky things going on to impress Lauren. Not many laughs in here, but certain things have to be done to overcome flaws in these guys as Lauren sees them. Lauren has to make a choice between the two men and her annoying friend, Trish (Chelsea Handler) tells her this time when she is not so-annoying: don't choose the better guy, choose the guy who will make you a better girl. Not bad advice, I suppose from someone who was annoying most of the time with her many, many sexual innuendo comments. There is nothing wrong with sexual innuendos when they are funny. In here they were not. Later the Russian spies make their presence known again and we see good fight scenes, a good car chase and some serious CGI. And then, somewhat okay became somewhat better. Violence: Yes. Sex: One time almost steamy foreplay leading up to it, but nothing after that as we fade to black. Nudity: No. Sexual innuendos: Yes: Trish spouts too many sexual innuendo comments. Not funny or good. Language: No.",This Means War
47,moviexclusive,"As ridiculous as it gets, this McG live-action cartoon with unfunny lines and terrible action wastes the great bromantic chemistry of its lead stars",3,16 February 2012,"McG must have watched one too many cartoons when he was a kid- how else will you explain his obsessive love for them? After venturing into more mature territory with the inspirational sports drama 'We Are Marshall' and the sci-fi thriller 'Terminator: Salvation', the director is back making live-action cartoons in the vein of his 'Charlie's Angels' duo- logy, and 'This Means War' sees him at his most indulgent. Indeed, there is nothing that can be taken seriously about this loud, preposterous and utterly logic-less action comedy that requires that its audience to check every brain cell at the door just so they can watch two handsome hunky CIA agents go at each other to win the affections of the same girl.That is the only catch of this lazily plotted movie from Timothy Dowling and Simon Kinberg- the former an actor turned writer who sadly demonstrates little of the subversive cleverness from his earlier 'Role Models' nor the broad but nonetheless inspired hilarity of 'Just Go With It'; and the latter an experienced hand at the genre (responsible for the studio's earlier hit 'Mr and Mrs Smith') enlisted to polish the banter and distract the audience from the glaring plot-holes. Neither writer tries hard enough, and without a solid well-grounded script to rein in McG's fluffy excesses, the result is a 'Smith' wannabe without the entertainment.To be sure, a film like this is always going to be as good as its individual gags, and so to trick you into the theatre, the trailer showcases the best the film has to offer. Remember the one where Agent Tuck (Tom Hardy) shoots a dart right into Agent FDR's (Chris Pine) neck so he falls fast asleep just before he is about to bed the girl Lauren (Reese Witherspoon)? Or the one where Lauren accidentally shoots a paintball at Tuck's crotch while attempting to discharge its triggering mechanism? Trust us, these individual sequences in the movie don't go beyond what the trailer already shows, so you're not really missing anything more.The banality of the rest of the movie is only made more apparent by the one-note characterisation. Tuck and FDR are both good-natured sensitive guys equally eligible, while Lauren is the pretty attractive girl with no luck at love. Then just to add in a shade of raunch because 'Bridesmaids' showed there was a place for girls to be talking dirty, Lauren has a perpetually horny best friend Trish (Chelsea Handler) whose only purpose is to goad Lauren to have sex with Tuck and FDR. At no point do you care if Tuck or FDR get the girl, simply because either guy is just as shallowly drawn.Ditto for the tired banter between Tuck and FDR, scripted without the wit nor the punch of Kinberg's 'Smith' or 'Sherlock Holmes'- in fact, the most memorable line is delivered by a fellow agent who tries politely to tell Tuck the night after FDR beds Lauren that the latter had 'entered the premises'. Fortunately, there is genuine bromantic chemistry between the two actors Pine and Hardy, both of whom do their best with the trite material that doesn't do justice to their heretofore-unknown sharp comedic timing.Against their natural bromance, Reese Witherspoon ends up regrettably nondescript, giving as little as the script demands of her. That the romance between Lauren and Tuck or FDR doesn't ring true is not entirely the actress' fault however- for some inexplicable reason, the script has them falling in love over a private trapeze session at an amusement park and a private showcase of Gustav Klimt masterpieces at some warehouse. Granted that a suspension of belief is de rigueur for most movies, but the leap of logic this McG live-action cartoon demands is just too absurd.And don't get us started about the poorly conceived action sequences that are so badly choreographed it's no wonder they are over before you know it. We're not just talking about over-the-top, but absolutely head- scratching nonsense that turns the pair of CIA agents into superheroes who pretty much emerge unscathed- except for some cuts- from every supposed life-endangering situation. Even with the paucity of such sequences (we count only three in total), McG can't even get the climax right- and a high-speed chase that ends on a dead-end freeway ramp is so laughably shot it goes in the running for the worst action sequence of the year. Whether as action or as comedy, this mishmash of a buddy picture, spy thriller and rom-com fails in every regard. We can accept a movie that doesn't take itself seriously, but one that disregards every ounce of logic ultimately causes its audience to pay little attention to it as well. Like we said, it's really another one of McG's live-action cartoons- how else really can two spies use the full resources of the CIA to spy on a personal subject without anyone raising any alarm- and it is as juvenile as its titular claim that two guys fighting over one girl could really mean war.",This Means War

What it does have are three charming actors who work hard to buoy it with their personality and charisma. Tom Hardy and Chris Pine work well together, actually their chemistry with each other is much stronger than either share with their female co-star. Reese is ditsy and sweet but whoever was in charge of her hair should be ashamed, it looks distractingly like straw. The director's roots in music videos are painfully obvious and he does nothing to smooth out the many kinks in the borderline creepy plot. Wasted in nothing parts are Til Schweiger a good actor stuck in a standard villain part that must have been larger in the original script and Angela Bassett, a great actress in a stick figure part that is so far beneath her abilities it's a crying shame.

The plot centers around Foster (Played by Chris Pine) and Tuck (Played by Tom Hardy) who are best friends while working for the CIA however they begin dating the same girl Lauren (Played by Reese Witherspoon).Which leads us to a series of events where both men try to get the girl.Now the plot is not something we haven't seen before but it is worth while to watch. Chris and Tom and Reese play off well with their characters that they play and given us quite some comedy moments which when I watch I got some good kicks out of it.

The script says they work for the CIA and are in pursuit of a bad guy named Heinrich. Evidently, the CIA is in deep trouble, because the cocky pair spend little time doing their assigned jobs. Angela Bassett, in a small unsympathetic role as their superior, is completely unable to manage the dynamic duo. Rather than focus their attention on Heinrich, Pine and Hardy each separately and unwittingly connect with the same young woman on an online dating site, using CIA computers and time, and spend the rest of the film competing with each other for her affections, also using CIA time and resources.As Lauren, the romantic objective of the pair, Reese Witherspoon is an eyeful and matches the duo in both cockiness and physical appeal. Although the script says Lauren is a consumer advocate, her attire suggests she is advocating something more than outdoor grills. Equally salacious and also advocating something more than mom and apple pie, Chelsea Handler plays Trish, Lauren's close friend and romantic adviser. While Handler may have thought she had an Oscar-worthy role, she comes across as abrasive and annoying. Her crude comments and frank sexual advice to Lauren are often distasteful and not particularly humorous. Even lovely Rosemary Harris, who appears briefly as FDR's grandmother, specializes in revealing embarrassing secrets about bodily functions. The script mistakenly associates crass with genuine humor.The explosive and exciting opening scene promises an entirely different movie from what actually plays out. The gunfire and explosions disappear, Heinrich seems to be a largely forgotten annoyance, and the film descends into a silly macho oneupmanship in ridiculous and unconvincingly set-up sequences. Eventually, entangled in its own complexity without a clear resolution, the film peters out in a pat, convenient, and unconvincing ending. Evidently, before they signed on, the three stars said ""show me the money,"" because none of their careers was enhanced by this slick, silly, unconvincing film.",This Means War

I remember this being out in cinemas at a time when my local multiplex had a hugely discounted offer meaning it was actually cheaper to see a new film such as this on the big screen than it was to rent a 4-9 month old one for the small screen at home. And to be honest I'm glad I paid a visit to Blockbuster (R.I.P) and walked out with less change in my pocket than pay a little less to sit through this trash. Chris Pine's character could have been played by almost anyone, Tom Hardy has the look of a man who knows without doubt that he's wasting his time, and Reese Witherspoon's lines largely amount to ""oh my god!"" over and over again. It's all a bit like watching clearly talented people all huddled around a dirty side-street giggling to themselves as they poke at road kill with a stick, only McG's there too dribbling onto himself while standing next to a sack of rotting dog corpses with his penis hanging out. This is a terrible, head thumpingly bad movie, with an awful half-arsed script, phoned-in performances, overblown and very fake looking action, and one of the worst unfunny bum note endings ever to land on a movie producer's desk.",This Means War
54,jon.h.ochiai,"Bromance Saves ""This Means War""",8,19 February 2012,"Reese Witherspoon panicked at wheel of the car speeds on Los Angeles freeway with dueling love interests, CIA agents played by Chris Pine and Tom Hardy. Pine fires off shots at bad guys in SUV, then screams to Hardy, ""I missed you!"" Hardy confesses, ""I love you, man!"" The Bromance between Pine and Hardy is the endearing deal in ""This Means War"". Pine is American player FDR. Hardy is the very British single father Tuck. So why is a Brit in the CIA? Anyway, Pine is the cool guy, and Hardy is the solid guy in Director McG's hysterical action packed ""This Means War"". This is surprising coming from McG, who must have a real name, and whose unfortunate claim to fame is the ""Charlie's Angels"" movies, and the horrendous ""Terminator: Salvation"".Pine and Hardy play in position as cool and solid, and have amazing chemistry which sparks ""This Means War"". Both are great looking guys, very athletic, and nail their action scenes with style whether leaping through the air shooting villains or leveraging deadly jujitsu moves. In this story CIA agents FDR and Tuck both fall in love with Lauren played by Witherspoon causing a rift in their friendship-- threatening the buddy action picture genre.Unfortunately, I think Witherspoon is horribly miscast. She does her best as cute and sweet Lauren, who is kind of a nerdy consumer products researcher rebounding from a failed relationship. The consumer researcher part is a unique twist in an otherwise perfunctory and predictable screenplay by Timothy Dowling and Simon Kinberg, from a story by Marcus Gautesen. I was puzzled that Kinberg, who wrote ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"", didn't strengthen the romantic elements or tension. Witherspoon is kind of left in a lurch, because her Lauren is reduced to more or less a plot device.Pine and Hardy's rugged chemistry salvage this narrative shortcoming punctuating their underlying brotherhood. Tuck (Hardy) pretexts this gentleman's agreement with FDR (Pine) not to have sex with Lauren while both pursue her affections by saying, ""You know I would take a bullet for you."" Ultimately, there is a weird downside: We really don't care who gets Lauren, as long as FDR and Tuck ""kiss and make up"". Dowling and Kinberg sufficiently provide the occasional shiny objects. FDR exudes touching vulnerability when he takes Lauren to visit his Nana (amazing Rosemary Harris), who raised him following a past family tragedy. Witherspoon is at her gracious best as Pine confesses, ""There are no mistakes."" We get insight into Tuck's burden as a single Dad for his son Joe (earnest John Paul Ruttan). His beautiful ex-wife Katie (stunning Abigail Spencer) is still the love of his life. Katie remains unaware of Tuck's CIA life. On a light note, Tuck has a run in with Joe's arrogant mixed martial arts instructor. For those who witnessed Hardy's physical prowess in ""Warrior"", we kind of know that this will not end well for him. Hardy has a subdued danger and power about himself, and it is nice to see the touching side. Pine is charming and funny, yet possesses a distinct gravitas. Their partnership and contrasting styles enroll us throughout ""This Means War"".Director McG deflects the diluted narrative with accelerated action and kinetic sense of humor. His visual style is vibrant, crisp, and clean. The opening action sequence on a luxury high rise in Los Angeles is like a James Bond movie. Elegantly evil Til Schweiger is powerful dealer Heinrich, who along with his brother Jonas (Clint Carleton) double cross an Asian Clan in bloody shoot out. FDR and Tuck on the operation wield their guns, punches and kicks to apprehend Heinrich. The martial arts sequences are cool looking throughout. Tragically, FDR kills Jonas while protecting his bud Tuck. Heinrich flees in a dramatic base jump. Heinrich swears vengeance for his brother. None too pleased with the outcome and damages, CIA Director Collins (stern Angela Bassett) place FDR and Tuck on desk duty in the interim. Idle hands and minds, and on-line dating website inadvertently lead to Lauren.One of the tangential story elements is Lauren's romance and sex adviser Trish, played by hysterical Chelsea Handler. I am a fan of Handler. However, though she is funny her Trish is one-dimensional. Fortunately, she is the butt of a hilarious joke. FDR and Tuck watch a live surveillance feed of Lauren and Trish. Staring FDR says, ""Why is she listening to that old man?"" I read some interesting reviews on the stalker vibe of ""This Means War"". In context these are CIA guys leveraging high tech resources in the name of romance. Rarely, has the Patriot Act been used as a punch line. As long as Pine and Hardy are wrestling at the controls, I'm all for it. ""This Means War"" is action packed, fun, and really entertaining.",This Means War

It is offensive to seniors, people with a physical disability, women and even old dogs.The non PC, offensive term ""Spaz"" is used in the script. Other then Angela Bassett in an unbelievable role as a CIA boss, the women are not favorable portrayed. Reese Witherspoon is in danger of having her Academy Award recalled for taking the part of the Blonde BimboThe Chris Pine character calls his grandmother ""Nana"". When she kisses an appropriate aged guy Pine calls it ""gross"" and makes a flat cataract joke. Later we learn he was raised by her to get our sympathy and win points with Reese.Well after a romantic and thrilling trapeze date the Witherspoon character laments that guy is dull and doesn't take chances. That makes no sense except to set up the excellent paint ball scene highlighted in the trailer.Too often after we see a scene we get what we saw repeated to friend Trish. Trish is another offensively written female character. There was nothing original in the dog shelter scene with the dog attack right out of ""Something About Mary"". Many other movies are seen or mentioned. In the video store any of the Hitchcock titles mentioned would be a better evenings entertainment. In addition to the better movies talked about, on TV are clips of ""Young Frankenstein"" ""Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid"" and ""Titanic"". All make you wish you were watching any of them instead.The action scenes work best. As a romantic comedy, there is very little chemistry with either guy and too few laughs.

Then there is a terrorist at large. Oh, did I forget Chelsea Handler is Witherspoon's best friend? Handler and Witherspoon do not mix. Hardy is a superior actor stuck in a clueless film. Since when do Stanford graduates need someone to tell them how to date especially someone like Handler? This film must have paid out big bucks to get this group to do this film.

Obviously, this is not going to happen so, much sooner than imagined, they start to use every mean considered necessary for this sole purpose.It's a movie which tries to seem serious by providing a good plot with a couple of good actors, but which can only lead to one result. Thus, what it ends up to be is a great comedy which presents multiple situations, bound to make you laugh out loud. The nice part is that it mostly succeeds, really making you laugh, or at least providing a very good time. The not so good part is that it tends to exaggerate in this aspect, focusing way too much on the funny part of things, leaving the story a little bit behind. It's not something that can ruin the experience, but it is worth noting it.The overall impression it leaves is a very positive one, managing to create an entertaining atmosphere, with a not so predictable course of events which ultimately lead to a quite satisfying finale.

Tom Hardy is slightly better his character is more likable I suppose, he's sort of the underdog of the two...Reese Witherspoon is pretty charming throughout the movie and her friend (played by Chelsea Handler) provides some fun moments with her straight forward in your face personality... There's a little action in the beginning and a action scene to end it all, in between though not so much, although the 2 men do get physical with one each other at some points it's not enough to suffice a action- buff who simply's in it for the action...It's alright fluffy entertainment",This Means War
59,JohnRayPeterson,"Made for fun, not for critics",6,5 May 2012,"This movie was highly predictable, flash and glitter, but despite all that, fun to watch. It has little redeeming value in way of script or story but the scenes are executed flawlessly and lots of money was put into it; this accounts for the very poor critics' scoring and rather satisfying audience scoring in contrast. I enjoyed it for little more reasons than the director's sense of timing and a change of subject matter (after a few heavy flicks, a light whatever this is was welcomed).There are three key characters at play here: Lauren, FDR Foster and Tuck, respectively played by Reese Witherspoon, Chris Pine and Tom Hardy. The other actors with some degree of screen time are Til Schweiger and Chelsea Handler; the former I'm familiar with, am usually satisfied with his performances and is well cast, while the latter I know little about and is also well cast based on this movie's performance. As for the three main actors, I never much cared for Witherspoon and this movie has done nothing to change my indifference; I enjoyed Pine's performance in both the 2009 Star Trek motion picture in which he played the lead, as well as the performance in this movie, and as for Tom Hardy, I'm simply a fan based on nine movies I've seen him in (Warrior, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Inception, Bronson, RocknRolla, Sucker Punch, Layer Cake and Black Hawk Down). If you watch the 2011 movie Warrior and don't count yourself as a fan, don't say you are when he gets nominated or even wins an Oscar one day.

But I strongly disagree. I saw it yesterday, and to me it was one of those, what do you call its, Guilty Pleasures. Granted, it has its clichés, but to me, it worked.Witherspoon plays a sweet lonely woman who gets more than she bargained for when she meets two guys, FDR(played by Chris Pine) and Tuck(Tom Hardy), and starts seeing them both. FDR is a ladies man, while Tuck is the more sensitive one. Coincidentally, both of them are best friends, and both of them are spies. So, once they both find out they're with the same woman, neither of them back out, and they both compete for her affections.It sounds as bad as, I don't know, a Kate Hudson movie. And granted, some of it is sort of dumb. But it's dumb fun, and proud of it. The actors here are all enjoyable to watch,l and though they could've had more fun making it than we did watching it, I still had a lot of fun watching it.The movie is the epitome of a guilty pleasure. It's fun, entertaining, and funny, believe it or not, thanks to actors like Chelsea Handler, who plays Witherspoon's best friend, and the rest of the cast.

The movie is about 2 secret agents trying to court the same girl. There is a lot of action in the movie and definitely a lot of stunts taking place.Plus one of the leads of the movie is Tom Hardy who's one of the most prolific actors of the last several years as far putting out quality work.

Like whenever either spy sabotages one another, both sharing the same character traits as Burt Reynolds and Kris Kristopherson in the 1977 comedy SEMI TOUGH, which borrows the same triangular premise.Here the spontaneous womanizer, Chris Pine, has to prove he's sensitive while the nice guy has to prove he's gutsy. And it's up to Witherspoon, with a consistently fervent expression, to decide. While expecting the viewer to embrace the characters before they've earned it, perhaps we have – this being a very clichéd rom-com, including Witherspoon's snarky best friend dishing bad advice that eventually makes sense.The action scenes are fun and, although shot in a glossy fashion (mirroring the director's CHARLIE'S ANGELS), all the running around make the two male leads seem legitimate in their trade – underlined by a somewhat contrived subplot involving a maverick assassin.But the dynamic duo, partners who risk their lives together, have more camaraderie with the girl than they do each other.

This Means War is about these two deadly CIA operatives are inseparable partners and best friends until they fall for the same woman. Having once helped bring down entire enemy nations, they are now employing their incomparable skills and an endless array of high-tech gadgetry against their greatest nemesis ever - each other. The one thing I always hate about these brain dead action comedy movies, is the fact that the action and comedy itself isn't well done and it feels out of place. Well what am I expecting from the same director who previously bought us Ouija, Terminator Salvation and 3 Days To Kill. If you haven't guess yet I hated this movie. This Means War unsettle me in so many wrong ways. The all film feels like it was written by a 13 year old boy who loves action films and was a big fan of Chris Pine and Tom Hardy, and also a fan of boobs, explosions and simply turning off you're brain and just take whatever is on the screen. This is the time were my job feels like living torture.The director of the film ""McG"" who's the best example to show to young film maskers out there of what not to do or what to avoid making a film, because this guy can't even directed action or even a good movie. Every shot looks cheap, lazy and uninspiring.The writing in this movie is... AWFUL!. Every time a character says something that suppose to be charming or cool comes off painful and extremely cliché to the point where I wanted to punch my TV screen to end the movie quicker. Dialogue is the most important thing to have in movies, and yeah in silent movies you didn't hear people talking, but you sawed the letters of dialogue on the screen and their lips moving, but when your main problem is the dialogue in you're film, you're movie is going nowhere. These one scene in this movie where Tom Hardy and Chris Pine meet with Reese Witherspoon character. At one point she couldn't decide who's better in bed, Hardy or Pine. So she has this big drama you know the crying and the running away to cry somewhere else. Now right they you can clearly see that the film wants me to care about her character and I simply don't, she's a freaking whore and deserves lots of pain, because she dated two guys at once, cheating on them and can't decide who's better in bed and she only pick one of them who's good at sex. Do you know why I hate this character and I will pay good money to see Captain Kirk and Bane teaming up to ruining this women life.

66,HelenMary,A daft; unbelievable premise in which Tom Hardy steals the show,6,7 June 2013,"At first, I didn't buy into the premise of these two guys going nutsy over Reese Witherspoon - sorry, I think she's a good actress but she's more girl next door than femme fatale. She does look good in this though, and I think she's fun and is always good in romcom roles. Tom Hardy does steal the show; his physicality is pretty much second to none and whist Chris Pine is good, and has those eyes, he'll always be a young Captain Kirk to me! Hardy is a chameleon; I remember his other roles but you don't see them in what he's doing here. I have no idea how he does it! It's a silly film, trying to be a double-act-across-the-pond Bond, and it almost works but it lacks something. I love all the gadgets, the spyware, the guns and the action in this - best comedy paintball scenes along the lines of The League with the paintball knife, this has a paintball grenade - and it's that which stops it being any other old romcom where the guys compete. TMW is a fun, easy on the eye, not challenging, funny (most of the funny lines at the hands of Chelsea Handler (BFF Trish) film.

Just because this movie was released around Valentine's Day, and it's filled with funny romance and entertaining action, that doesn't mean that this movie is anything worth your time. Even though this movie was released in February, ""This Means War"" is one of the worst movies of this or any other year. ""This Means War"" stars Chris Pine and Tom Hardy as two ""best friend"" CIA agents, Pine as the hit ladies' man, and Hardy as the desperate single man. Now, it turns out, coincidentally, that both Pine and Hardy has met Reese Witherspoon separately, and they both fall in love with her. Witherspoon plays a single woman, desperate and in need for a man. But guess what? We don't believe that she's desperate for love! There's a scene earlier in the beginning of the movie when Witherspoon is reunited with a former ex, and she acts like a damn 12-year-old girl. So, it's a fight to the death, when both Pine and Hardy fight for Reese Witherspoon's love, without affecting their friendship, until it leads into both sabotaging each other's dates. But what's worse is that they stalk her, invade her privacy, and spy on her! But, you know what, it doesn't matter, because Reese Witherspoon wants to date both of them at the same time!!!! Is this ""Jack and Jill"" - Part 2? ""This Means War"" is such a waste of true filmmaking, meaning that it's not funny nor entertaining! The action scenes are completely awful, all choppy and headache-inducing, and it delivers such horrible directing and editing. Also, this movie delivers some of the most shallow, unrealistic, and stupidest characters ever put to film. Chris Pine and Tom Hardy act like two annoying 15-year-old boys, Reese Witherspoon's character is so stupid and unrealistic, and the completely unfunny Chelsea Handler plays Witherspoon's best friend, delivering one of the worst performances in the history of film. The plot is filled with unnecessary plot holes, the jokes fell flat, the directing is incompetent, the writing was horrendous, and the ending was one of the most crappiest endings ever put to film. But what's worse is that if Reese Witherspoon doesn't know that these two guys are fighting for her, behind her back, how about the fact that she doesn't tell one guy about the other? Doesn't that make everybody a liar? Directed by McG, who seems to be giving ""the finger"" to Michael Bay, ""This Means War"" is such a headache-inducing, undeniably annoying, completely unrealistic, and terribly unfunny mess that deserves to be one of the worst movies of the entire year so far.

68,Ramascreen,It's a blast,8,24 February 2012,"Finally! A Valentine's season movie that guys, who don't care much for mushy lovey-duvey things, can also enjoy! THIS MEANS WAR is a blast! Chris Pine and Tom Hardy provide the action, and America's sweetheart Reese Witherspoon provides the rom-com, with funnygirl Chelsea Handler who gets A+ in my book for being a great comic relief. Nice comeback by director McG who disappointed us back in 2009 with Terminator Salvation.. If you've come to get purely entertained, nothing more, nothing less, then you've come to see the right movie, THIS MEANS WAR is spy vs. spy hilarity, non-stop laughs, physical humor that mixes Bond-esque gadgets with tug of war competition. And when you cut it right in half, you'd find that it's also a buddy comedy, on one hand you have Pine-Hardy, and on the other Witherspoon-Handler. This movie's got so much energy to last a century, the action sequences are far-fetched and ridiculous and they feel animated but they're exciting and fun to watch, they become some sort of a vehicle that takes FDR (Pine) and Tuck (Hardy) from best of friends into two people who could no longer be in the same room, and if they are, it's only a matter of minutes before all kinds of objects around them start to break. Everybody's going to be enchanted by the two good looking guys and cutie Reese Witherspoon as Lauren, but I think Chelsea Handler is this film's secret weapon, at first you may see her character, Trish, as that typical annoying best friend who encourages you to do bad just so she could gloat in either your accomplishment or failure but Handler's character serves more purpose than just that.THIS MEANS WAR could've easily gone south but luckily the humor works, it fires from left and right, unexpectedly and you'd find yourself cracking up every single time. It's not one of those that starts out strong and then goes downhill, It never goes stale, from start to finish the humor is fresh and constant. Whether it be dating humor, sex humor or testosterone humor, THIS MEANS WAR stays genuinely funny. You will laugh out loud at the creative covert ops to gather intel about what Lauren likes or dislikes, not to mention the way each side tries to sabotage the other's secret mission. I think the script is smart, not only does it present this relationship dilemma but it presents it in a way that somewhat makes fun of how people often play dating game, by comparing people, everybody is at fault here because Tuck and FDR lie to Lauren and Lauren lie to both of them. The two guys represent this ancient masculinity that's very basic, who gets to have the loudest roar, who gets to better impress the lady. The covert ops that Desperately trying to read what their woman wants eventually turns each of them into someone they're not and friendship becomes the victim and collateral damage. I'm aware that there are rom-coms out there you just can't stand but if you give THIS MEANS WAR a shot, you'll find that this particular rom-com makes for a great dating movie on a Saturday night, the perfect blend of action and comedy.",This Means War
69,troyputland,This Means War,7,13 April 2015,"Male viewers want to watch the latest action movie. Female audiences would rather see a romantic comedy (as the stereotypes go). How do you keep both genders happily entertained with one film? By mixing the genres together, and with This Means war, it pays off. Reese Witherspoon's Lauren is the centre of attention. She's blissfully unaware that the two men she's dating happen to be best friends. She carefully juggles woman down-on-her-luck with the strong woman to aspire to (for the women, only). Pals and partners FDR (Chris Pine) and Tuck (Tom Hardy) bring the action, but their initial mission takes a back seat as they wage war against each other for her affection. FDR is the confident, often cocky type and Tuck is the silent, kind hearted British type. They eavesdrop on Lauren's conversations to win her over. This opens up an intelligent scene that sees Witherspoon dancing around her apartment making popcorn whilst Pine and Hardy expertly place cameras when she's not looking. As highly entertaining as their squabble is, it's foolish that they're allowed to use the CIA's resources to spy on each other. Blah blah's villain is wasted, Chelsea Handler is hilarious as Witherspoon's mad friend and potential competition between the agents could be used elsewhere, but This Means War is still an entertaining, funny watch thanks to its dogmatic love triangle.Check out my other reviews on http://straighttelling.co.uk",This Means War

A Girly movie starring two pretty boys fighting over Reese Witherspoon? Although I would off preferred too see Daniel Radcliffe tackle some ghosts, I can't deny that ""This means war"" was surprisingly entertaining.As Seen in the trailers, the plot evolves around Chris Pine (The pretend captain kirk) and Tom Hardy (usually awesome anyway!) as two secret agents who meet the same girl, and go too extreme measures too win her over. Quite why they'd be fighting so much over Reese Witherspoon is anyone's guess, but I digress. What ""This means war"" has going for it (especially seeing as its a bloody rom-com) is that its actually pretty damn funny! Now I've just read elsewhere online that the films been slated by almost everyone. But that's fine. I love having an opposite opinion. This'll make up for all the super popular films that I've bashed. If ""This means war"" was like its last 15 minutes or so all the way through, then yes, it would off been pretty terrible.

It's a cartoonish film that wavers in tone, and the lazy screenwriter didn't create interesting or necessary supporting roles. There's a pointless and unfunny karate instructor and poor Chelsea Handler is poorly lit and photographed and her job is to pop up every so often to talk dirty and make you wonder why she and Witherspoon's character would be friends. The film has a cool, impersonal look that may be just right for this type of nonsense. Think of frosty Witherspoon as Doris Day with 2 Rock Hudsons. Besides it's more entertaining and less belabored than the Hudson/Day comedies Lover Come Back(1962) and Send Me No Flowers (1964). This Means War is enjoyable enough to be worth your time if not your undivided attention.",This Means War
72,mattiasflgrtll6,"Funny, I guess, but wow, what a flawed movie",7,20 November 2014,"In a way, it works as a sorta entertaining dumb movie to watch on Saturday noon. On the other hand, it's also so dumb it's almost incomprehensible. For example, there is a big problem with the writing of the characters. I've seen plenty of movies with stereotypes which I liked anyway, but in this case, it's pretty ingrating. Throw in Witherspoon's character, WHAM! We have the woman who always have a checklist of ten thousand goddamn things she demands for her crush to be perfect. Like, ""Hahaha, it's funny, because women are demanding!!!"". This is not the worst problem though. The biggest issue is the two male leads. I get that they are competing for the same woman and use nasty methods to make her choose only one of them, but they are written to be too similar. They are both childish in the same way, have similar plans of ruining it for one another and overall almost feels like twins. Except they are not. Just very good friends (until now, of course). And then, this is STILL not the most serious problem. What irritates me TO NO END is the forced ""action"". The mix of action, romance and comedy may be quite interesting, as I'm not sure if it has been done before, but it doesn't blend together here! We have a villain introduced at the beginning of the movie, but he is sooner than dust disappearing forgotten about. Then, suddenly at THE TEN LAST MINUTES, he appears again! What the hell? Why create a villain if he barely will have any screen time? How does this even qualify as a action movie. And when the actual action kicks in... I really DON'T get the feeling the characters are in danger. Some gun shots, ridiculously overused slow-motion and it's pretty much over. Also, why does Witherspoon's character pick one of the men at all? They are both total assholes! Screw 'em. Then the two of them begin fighting again for some odd reason and the movie ends. Thanks to Chris Pine and Tom Hardy's excellent comedic timing, the movie still manages to be quite chuckleworthy and there is on ocassion a hilarious moment. (That doesn't go for the lame paintball-in-the-crotch-joke) See this movie if you have nothing else to do, but if you don't want to watch a comedy where a lot of things don't make sense, skip this one.",This Means War
73,jaxbubba,"A very, very, very cute little film",7,4 April 2012,"""This Means War"" – A very, very, very cute little film; half rom-com and half buddy picture. Chris Pine (the new Capt James T Kirk) and Tom Hardy (Bane in the upcoming Batman Rises) star as two CIA operatives FDR and Tuck. In the opening film sequence the two foil a terrorist covert operation; however, in the process, they inadvertently kill the lead terrorist (Heinrich) brother as well. Due to the incredible debacle at the scene of the crime, both FDR and Tuck are suspended from field duty. During this time the two chance upon Reese Witherspoon (Lauren), at different occasions, and the two CIA agents wage an epic battle to woo the unsuspecting Consumer Product Tester. It's a ""no holds barred"" / winner take all contest in which every CIA department and/or asset can be used to sabotage the other's success. However, the best part of the movie (by far) is Chelsea Handler's supporting role as Trish; Lauren's BFF and advice counselor. Chelsea simply steals every scene that she is in, and perfectly cast for this role. The film really is at it's best when the film concentrates on the interaction of the love triangle / rom-com contest between Pine, Hardy and Witherspoon; the buddy flick terrorist aspect is far less interesting. especially the last twelve (12) minutes of this film. However, I did enjoy this film. There is enough action to keep a guys interest, and rom-com stuff to keep the girls happy as well. Basically this film is the perfect date flick. Best laugh in the film has to be the kennel scene.. LMFAO!!!!! Enjoy! SEE MORE OF MY REVIEWS @ THE FARIS REEL ON FACEBOOK.",This Means War
74,julian-mumford,Almost incompetent comedy/romance caper,4,27 July 2012,"Tuck (Hardy) & FDR Foster (Pine) are top CIA agents, wasting bad guys in Hong Kong one minute (really a poorly concealed set) and then are benched, as they have a killer on their tail (Schweiger), seeking revenge for his dead brother.Whilst spinning their wheels, your tax dollars at work, their thoughts turn to love. We have two opposites, Foster is a womanizer with an apartment with swimming pool ceiling and beauties drifting past. Tuck meanwhile is hungry for real love, following his estrangement from his wife and young son.Unaware that they have both met and started dating Lauren (Witherspoon), the best buddies once confronted with this dilemma, decide to let the best man win.We should then be treated to a comedy romance with slick action sequences, as the pair decide to use all CIA resources at their disposal, to spy on and interrupt each others plans.Unfortunately the comedy is leaden, there is minimal chemistry between the leads and the action sequences are poor. Tom Hardy does his best but this really is a sinking ship taking down all passengers down, irrespective of class.Both male characters are either more in love with themselves or each other rather than the token love interest, which makes for a very strange threesome.The lengths and resources used to track each others movements leave the station marked ""preposterous"", several stops ago. A drone to follow the couple out driving, which is shot down by a hand gun? Casing the apartment for likes and dislikes, dressed in combat gear, as Lauren dances with a tub of popcorn and headphones is not funny. It's just plain creepy.Of course many disposable characters die in firefights but this is fine, as one of the leads always stays behind to ""clean up"", the story makes ""True Lies"" look like a documentary Characterization is non existent, glib comments from the boys are as deep as it gets and Witherspoon has nothing to do whatsoever. The only slight glimmer of interest derives from Lauren's BFF Trish (Handler), who at least is given some reasonable lines she delivers well but it's not enough to rescue the whole enterprise.Chris Pine, Tom Hardy and Reese Witherspoon all good actors, unfortunately hit what must be a career low in this film.The film is directed by McG which may be enough to steer many regular cinema goers away, if this is not enough I would add that this is a poor film which squanders it's resources and talents.There may have been a light hearted romcom in the script somewhere and with a deft Directors hand it could have worked. This however is not that film.Summary A very poor, almost incompetent comedy/romance caper, one can only hope that any sequel plans are immediately terminated with extreme prejudice.Not recommended http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/",This Means War
75,EmmaDinkins,Chix Chat on Film review: Spy vs Spy for love,8,20 February 2012,"This film has to be one of the best Spy versus Spy films that I can recall in recent years. And as a girly girl I would not have rather seen it in any other format than a Rom-Com. This was a nice little mutt of a film blending some cool action adventure (the Labrador) and special effects with a comedic boy meets/gets/loses girl love story (the Poodle) to boot. The blend was very effortless and turned out to be a cute labradoodle, that I would have no problems with taking home. The trailer reveals the fact that FDR (Chris Pine) and Tuck (Tom Hardy) are competitively pursuing the same girl, Lauren (Reese Witherspoon), and we see Lauren talking about dating both guys with her gal pal Trish (Chelsea Handler), but there is so much more to this film than the aforementioned. This film has a terse little background revenge story that is set up in the opening scenes, there were some really cool stunts at play to pull off the fight scenes and make them as credible and as exciting as they were. And I especially liked the stunts on wheels. There was some very strong casting in this film with FDR and Tuck are reporting to a very tough Collins (Angela Bassett), she is always a great actress and her commanding presence made me want to sit up in my seat every time she came on screen. Til Schweiger (Heinrich) makes for a very credible villain and I found it ironic that I just seen him in the 2008 movie The Red Baron, although depending on your point of view he was no villain in that film. There is always a level of predictability that comes along with any rom-com and this one was no exception. I was certain very early in the story who would inevitably win Lauren, but it was still a lot of fun to watch. Typically in any rom-com there are a number of mushy love songs, but this film had some upbeat numbers that fit in the situations and locales throughout the story. I had a blast from the past with the 'This is How We Do It' popcorn moment, but thought that there was no way anyone could have been that stealth. The film was very entertaining, and although there was a lot going on I was a little distracted by the blue-eyed invasion. Is it the digital presentation or does Chris Pine have the bluest eyes on the planet? This Means War gets a green light from me.",This Means War
76,rcolgan,An awful idea made in to an awful movie,3,29 April 2014,"There are some films that will be trapped in Hollywood for many years and turn out to be great successes by being different and unique in style such as American Hustle. This film is not one of them. Instead it's one of those films that got trapped in the drafting and redrafting the script because nobody could make it work, for the film only to be released any way regardless of the lack of any single strand of intellect coming from the film.The plot itself should never have warranted a film alone, as it is based on two secret agents who both go on a date with a girl, only to find out that they are dating the same girl. After finding this out they begin to compete with one another in what I can only describe as being some of the creepiest stalking put to screen since Elijah Wood in Maniac.The story is likely one of those attempts at trying to please both the male and female audiences by trying (and failing) to incorporate elements of romance and action to try and appeal to that date night audience. How the makers of this film ever thought they would satisfy either of these audiences though is beside me with the action scenes being as exciting as watching a guy who is watching another guy painting a wall due to its blandness and lack of any thrilling moment. They consist of nothing but poorly shot and generic fight scenes that you could pretty much just cut and paste at any point in the film.And then there's the romance element which also fails, largely due to how much you'll hate all of all the main characters. First we have Chris Pine as the cocky stereotype who doesn't settle down and goes girl after girl. Whilst he is trying to be this cool ladies man he ends up being a freak who gets a date by going to the girls workplace and refusing to leave until he gets a date. How romantic...Then we have Tom Hardy who it is horrifying to see appear in this film. He is a great actor who had picked good roles until now as he plays a guy who wants a commitment and meets the girl on a dating site. Even Hardy who shines charisma can do nothing to save his character as he is nothing more than a bland template who is meant to be the lovable dream guy but at times comes off more like an ass hole such as when he bullied a bunch of kids at paint ball. It's the actors worst role to date and I hope that he'll stick to better roles in future.Finally to finish this trio of terrible we have Oscar winner Reese Witherspoon. I say Oscar winner to remind myself that she has had good roles like Walk the Line as in this her character seems to set woman back by about 20 years due to her single role in the film being a trophy. That and being the figure for the worst possible representation of feminine role model by thinking it's alright to decide who to date by sleeping with both of them. It's one of the most insulting roles that I've seen in recent years and does not have a single likable element to the character.To top this off, it is a comedy that does not have a single funny moment. Throughout the entire film I did not laugh once. It seemed to act under the incorrect assumption that stalking and girls talking about sex is funny. It's the kind of humour that feels like it was probably written by a 5 year old. Beyond this for what classes itself as an action there is surprisingly little by way of action, with only 2 fight scenes in the film and when they do fight it's poorly shot and has little reason for being other than to try and appeal to the action loving audience.Overall it is a film with no redeeming feature. The characters are annoying, the acting is appalling and the attempted action is the film is poor to say the least. The film tries to appeal to everyone and in doing so it appeals to nobody.",This Means War

This is a prime example of just how some genres can't be mixed. I didn't like Chris Pine and Tom Hardy much (except for Hardy's voice), and Witherspoon and Pine didn't have any chemistry at all. The only character I liked a little was Joe, even though Joe is not a proper kid's name. It's gotta be Joseph or Joey or Jay.Also, I'd just like to say that based on the fact that they both lied to her for a few months, their relationship definitely did not work out.

On paper, THIS MEANS WAR looks gamely potential: it has three charming leads of Chris Pine, Tom Hardy and Reese Witherspoon and a high-concept premise that recalls the work of TRUE LIES (1994) and MR. & MRS.

After a covert operation doesn't go as planned the duo find themselves riding their desks in the Los Angeles agency office much to their chagrin.FDR (Chris Pine) is very confident ladies' man while Tuck (Tom Hardy) is a divorced father of a little boy looking for ""the one"". The more reserved Tuck decides to take his chances with online dating while FDR is content to cruise the local video store searching for his latest conquest. Enter Lauren (Reese Witherspoon), an attractive, independent woman who appears to have everything except a love life.When Lauren encounters her former fiancé engaged to another woman, she vents her frustration to her best friend Trish (Chelsea Handler) who decides to take matters into her own hands and, unbeknownst to Lauren, produces an online dating profile for Lauren which matches her with Tuck. The first meeting between the two goes very well and they decide to take things slowly and see where this promising start leads. Unfortunately as Trish is heading home she stops in the same video store were FDR is on the prowl and the two mix like oil and water. Undeterred, FDR decides to pursue Lauren.Eventually Tuck and FDR realize that they're seeing the same woman and, not wanting to put their friendship in jeopardy, agree that they will continue to see her and let Lauren decide whom she prefers. The fact that neither men in this love triangle acknowledges that they know each other leads to some interesting complications, and naturally jealousies arise between the two friends.With the full resources of the CIA at their disposal, Tuck and FDR, who've both become captivated with Lauren, soon take advantage of their job not only to spy on each other's dates with Lauren but also to do their best to undermine the other and gain valuable information to help them appear more desirable to Lauren. As if this wasn't complicated enough, an international criminal named Heinrich (Til Schweiger) is searching for the two agents to seek revenge. Constantly battling one another as well as the impending threat of Heinrich, FDR and Tuck embark on a hysterical and action-packed adventure that is one of the most enjoyable romantic comedies in recent memory.Sure the film does take a few leaps in logic, such as the CIA turning a blind eye to their use of so many high-level resources in the world of dating but anyone seeing this type of film obviously isn't expecting realism.Directed by McG the film mixes action and comedy with a touch of romance and creates an entertaining formula. The three leads work exceptionally well with one another and Hardy and Pine are clearly stars on the rise. Handler does some great supporting work in the film and gets more than her share of laughs. This is definitely one you will not want to miss.4 stars out of 5",This Means War

I like the different dynamics you get to see between the main actors playing an action character whilst also playing a romantic. This was one of the first films I saw Tom Hardy in and I really like him in this and I like him with Chris Pine as they genuinely seem like good friends. There's some really good comedy in this film too, some scenes and jokes that just make me laugh and have some clever meaning behind them. But the thing that lets this movie down is it's strange editing, some scenes just end so abruptly and it feels so disconnected and bizarre. Some bits have some awful green screen and it's so strange as they're just scenes outside of a house, like could they not have just filmed outside of any house rather than using an awful green screen. The film has this awful filter on it that makes everything brighter and it makes the camera look over exposed and strange. I do like this film and I can have a good time watching it and it's always a good go to film to just have on in the background. It's nothing groundbreaking but it's good fun!",This Means War

I hate when pure comedies want to put on the serious side and try to explain everything, they just ruin them.If you think this movie is pure trash just because you didn't like the first 10 minutes, please, consider again, what follows through with this nice little comedy is pure fun, two CIA agents that want to get the same girl seems clichéd but it works.There is a very definite chemistry between Reese, Tom Hardy and Pine, they feel like best friends, they compete each other like 7 years old kids with hi-tech devices and I could not stop laughing, there are some scene that are, well, hilarious.The most important factor of this whole scheme is that it doesn't seem forced at all, somehow McG managed to make a movie about 2 CIA operatives using all the government resources to spy on a girl for each camper to feel completely natural and so the comedy parts really flows.McG did a poor job with T-Salvation but with this one, he really got it.Definitely one of the nicest comedies around, if you want to be entertained and have fun with a nice comedy that does not need to use raunchy humor at all to give you a smile, please do yourself a favor a take a look at this one.It is a feel good movie.My wife and I simply loved it !8 out of 10",This Means War
83,v-ley,OK not great,6,10 July 2016,"It wasn't as bad as most of the people writing reviews have said. I found it entertaining, to a certain point. After ""tuck"" has his date, there was no need for the other one to jump right in, it doesn't happen in real life up to a point, I'm guessing. I'm not giving anything away, it's all in the bio. The actors, at least Tom, was way above the silliness, and you can tell he wasn't enjoying this movie as much as his more serious roles. He is too good of an Actor for this movie and his talent is wasted. Chris comes off as this creepy- older- smooth- operator and that just doesn't go away, a normal woman would have picked that up in a heartbeat. I didn't pause or fast forward, which is a plus, but I really wouldn't recommend the movie if you are truly wanting a feel-good Rom-Com. I agree that Reese wasn't her best, or if she is, she's NOT my kind of actor. Again, I have to go with it being just too silly. It would have made a better movie if one of the guys had had to choose, and not the other way around. She wasn't believable, and quite frankly, Tom was too good for this movie.",This Means War
84,antonjsw1,Some funny scenes but nothing much else,5,21 July 2013,"After two extremely good films in We Are Marshall and the excellent Terminator Salvation, McG makes a rather big mistake with this occasionally funny but terrible mish-mash of a film. While his Charlie's Angels films were somewhat absurd at one level, they were funny, exciting, well- paced and thanks to their charismatic cast, had a great feel-good factor and energy level that permeated throughout the films. An attempt to replicate this factor totally fails in this film, and as a result scenes feel either hugely contrived or terribly disjointed as the tone of the film shifts radically from scene to scene, making the film difficult to get into and therefore leading to a hugely frustrating viewing experience.While performances are competent on a technical level, they don't really gel together. Pine's character comes across as smug, arrogant, superficial, and someone dis-likable making it something of a puzzle how someone so successful yet unlucky in love as Reese Witherspoon's character would be attracted to such an individual. Tom Hardy's character actually comes across as charming and a lot more likable, but his back-story with an ex-partner and their child is criminally under-utilised. To make matters worse the main protagonist, played by Til Schweiger is not given enough screen time for the audience to get into the character, so he comes across as nothing more than a mechanical plot device rather than a character that you would be interested in.As a result the film becomes filled with a series of gags, some admittedly very funny, others unsurprising and clichéd, and yet other cringe-worthingly awful. The style and look of these set pieces seems to be different, and there doesn't seem to be a consistent tone between each of these set pieces. The action seems to be framed too tightly and lit too brightly on the actors, as if it is being shot for television rather than film. This is a surprise when the photographer is Russell Carpenter, Oscar winner for Titanic. In fact, the style of the film reminded me of the TV series 'Chuck', and while bigger and grander than that episodic series, that series was a great deal more entertaining.Overall, a big disappointment.",This Means War

So I was with a friend, and we decided to watch a catch a movie together, and he was so pushing to watch this, so i went in with very low expectations.To tell the truth though, the movie did surprise me, it was much better than I was expecting, and the whole Spy vs Spy, where both the two CIA agents fighting for the love of one woman concept actually worked. it was a funny and hilarious, and i think what worked most and made this successful is the glowing chemistry between the three lead actors. they all seemed comfortable in their roles, and seemed to really have fun making this film.the film is as expected from its genre, does not take anything seriously, it is just pure fun, and the plot is quite simple and i'm sure most already know what it is about. the two Spies start using some of their skills and resources from working with the CIA to help get closer to Reese's character and win her love, from surveillance cameras to special spy gadgets which adds more to the fun.So if you have nothing else to do, or are a big fan of these types of films, than i strongly recommend it, and it would be more suitable to attend with your special one, I do believe it is much fun for couples to go and catch this film.I'd say 8 out of 10 moebardi.blogspot.com",This Means War

It would probably come up with a new genre called the 'romantic action comedy'. It would probably come up with, 'This Means War'. I spent most of the movie trying to figure out who it was targeted for. First, no adult with a few functioning neurons will find the plot compelling. I doubt if women would find the romance unforgettable. I, therefore, concluded that the movie was targeted towards 15 year old boys out on their first dates. Yes, there are the obligatory action scenes with the required number of explosions and car chases, but this is mainly to wake up the 13-year-olds who fell asleep during the 'romantic' scenes. The comedy, and I am stretching the dictionary definition of that word here, comes mainly from the sexual remarks of Chelsea Handler and are directed at the same sleepy 13-year-olds.It's too bad. I like Reese Witherspoon and, prior to this movie, I had concluded that she was never in a bad movie. Isn't she being offered any better roles than this? It is one of the few movies where you feel sorry for the guy who gets the girl. Actually, by that point in the movie, you really don't care.

A trio of good looking leads help too and there a couple of decent action scenes mixed with odd comedy. Unfortunately there is not really an abundance of romance in which the film is touted to have. Anyway two best mates and top CIA operatives are on the hunt for an international killer on the loose in the US, however they also meet and go after the same beautiful woman. At first they didn't know, but after finding out they want and actually like Reese Witherspoon, its on for young and old using all the benefits of government gadgets to watch or disrupt the other while with her. This is stupid and I really liked what McG (Director) did with Terminator 4. Its fast paced, funny it bits and Tom Hardy/Chris Pine have chemistry. Reese is involved in a fantastic scene inside a video shop where she discusses Alfred Hitchcock, a nice moment for film fans.",This Means War
98,amahlanand,Laughs Aplenty,8,9 May 2012,"'This Means War' pits smooth operator FDR (Chris Pine) against the more sedate but slick Hank (Tom Hardy). No, it's not some sort of epic physical battle, at least not in the way you would think. Instead, these two FBI agents jostle for the attention of Lauren (Reese Witherspoon), going so far as to use the FBI resources at their disposal to outdo one another. What results is endless hilarity beginning from the sabotaging of each other's dates, to the awkward 'office' scenes where the two invariably meet up throughout the movie to exchange and inflict 'battle scars' upon one another. Witherspoon may have been the center of attention for the film, but the chemistry between its two male leads left her in the shadows, both feeding off one another fittingly in both action and dialogue. Going in expecting an intricate FBI related plot will leave you completely and utterly disappointed, that particular subplot was quite shambolic, and superfluous leading to a climax which was rashly thrown in and detracted from the otherwise light-hearted nature of the movie.You can always gauge a 'romcom' success by the audience's reaction. By my reading, the constant laughter gave the impression of a thumbs up. Is it your typical chick flick? Yes, it is, in the vein of (insert common romcom here). But regardless, it would be hard to suppress more than a few grins that appear throughout the film.",This Means War

It still has that kids humor filled with dumb sex jokes that only a 10 year old kid would laugh at, but it's fortunately redeemed by some funny jokes put in here and there. There was this one scene that made me laugh out loud, but I'm not gonna spoil anything for you.The action scenes in this movie are badly done for action movie standards, but they were still a nice change of pace for the film.Overall, This Means War is a pretty good film, and I recommend seeing it if there's nothing else for you to watch.",This Means War
100,FFman-847-460126,"Bad Writing, Good Acting.",5,18 February 2012,"This Means War is built on two parallel story lines. This would be alright if the writers had spent time and effort developing both stories. Instead, we get a well-developed story about two spies fighting over a girl. Meanwhile, the actual CIA business feels like more of an afterthought. The movie would have been much better without the disturbing simplistic subplot. It appears that the writers liked the idea of CIA agents being able to spy on their girlfriendbut forgot to care about what the CIA really does.Three actors drive this movie with little help from the outside actors. Reese Witherspoon. Chris Pine. Tom Hardy. Although these actors did their job well, the roles they were forced into were sub-par. Reese Witherspoon's role is extremely forced. Chris Pine's role of a guarded man with a sad past simply turns him into a flat character. Tom Hardy's character starts off well, but only gets worse from there. It's the writers' fault on the lack of character development. Are we sensing a theme yet?This Means War had potential. If the screenwriters built believable characters and a real storyline, this movie could have been great. Without it, this movie is rather mediocre. The surrounding characters add a strange element to the movie. Reese Witherspoon's friend –played by Chelsea Handler—is a necessary role takes a strange but entertaining direction. This, however, can be canceled out by all the worthless CIA minor characters.Without giving away, I must talk about the climax. It is utterly unbelievable. It would have been better if they stopped the movie short of a conclusion. For those 15 minutes, This Means War changes from a romantic comedy to satire. It didn't work. Instead, they had to conclude the afterthought subplot in dramatic fashion. What made this movie somewhat enjoyable disappeared to make way for one final gimmick.This movie is enjoyablebut you can do better. If you are looking for a good romantic comedy, The Vow is a bit better. Your best bet would be to wait a month and wait to see what comes out. When movies such as this one are released with an undeveloped plot, I can't help but wonder what deserving script was passed over. I guess that's just another problem to add to the mix in Hollywood.",This Means War
101,richy1024,This is when threesomes stray away from fantasy!,5,7 October 2012,"It's a woman's dream to be swept off her feet by a strong, physically handsome, money earning man. Lauren (Witherspoon) is indecisive when it comes to the opposite sex. She likes some assets in some men but then not so many in others. Frank (Pine) and Tuck (Hardy) are partners in crime, the top of their division. One suffers a split from an ex love with whom he has an infant to be responsible for and senses love from another woman to end his heartache love-split. The other is someone who has no desire to find a woman sooner than his associate in crime. After a brief coincidence, revealing a picture to each other of the same woman they have been dating, they find themselves in direct opposition and bitterness with one another to win Lauren's 'sweet' and 'innocent' heart.The story is exceptionally uncomplicated and undemanding on its audience. Glorified action sequences and over-enthusiastic dates between the trio, from explosive paint-balling to employing an expert team feeding information through ear devices on a 24 hour watch, used as a tool to feed information through to the male hero to make him seem articulate. All of this is done in comedic fashion in the interest of Witherspoon's pretty-to-hide-the-dim-ness-blondeness (although she claims to be a scientist of some kind). On the bounce of this the relationship between the trio works intriguingly. This feature provides a bit of everything for everyone, romance, action, conflict, ostentatious cars, muscles, a blonde & stacks of comedy round-ups, particular strands of this come from Chelsea Handler and her amusing sense of personality and tone as Witherspoon's devoted and honest friend.",This Means War
102,tomosp1965,This means bore!,2,18 September 2019,"I get the idea of two buddies fighting over the same girl, and the idea of two agents being hunted for killing a terrorists brother. The problem I have is that the two ideas combined into a story, well it's just too unbelievable. Reese Witherspoon is not what I would call 'Beautiful', as she is too small, too ordinary and too blonde. Yet, the two handsome agents begin a fued over the said girl. Tom Hardy is a fine actor, but his acting talent isn't really tested in this movie, neither is Pines. I found the premise interesting, but it is just too contrived, which spoils the whole believability of the movie. This film doesn't know whether it's an action thriller, a pastiche, or whether it's a romantic comedy. There are a few 'Hitchcock' references, but this film is miles away from the cinematic genius of Hitchcock. At the end I sighed, as the whole thing was just a waste of time, and obviously an attempt to cash in on the genre of buddy film success.Sorry, just hated it.

The principals don't try to assassinate each other, merely to undermine one another's efforts, and the story works. Also, it doesn't hurt in a Rom-Com that Reese Witherspoon looks gorgeous throughout--as I suppose do Chris Pine and Tom Hardy for those more inclined in that direction--and the supporting cast is equally charming, with Chelsea Handler and Abigail Spencer especially deserving of kudos.

It's meant to be fantasy not reality. It isn't heavy on the action or emotion or really anything. It is just a fun light-hearted movie that knows not to linger in any one action sequence or love scene too long. It also knows not to take itself too seriously and I didn't either. Some stupid comedies are just stupid but some make you laugh and this one made me laugh. Then again, I had just watched War Horse and was in serious need of a mood lightener. (Honestly, after the unrelenting War Horse, I might have laughed at anything.) Moral of the story, you don't like stupid predictable rom coms that lack clear logic or believability, pass.

107,stevenball2,Reese Witherspoon breaks the rules,1,17 March 2012,"One of the cardinal rules of film for any actress is: Never make a movie with a leading man who is better looking than you are. She made that mistake in WATER FOR ELEPHANTS. Her leading man in that movie was both better looking and YOUNGER. In THIS MEANS WAR Reese Witherspoon again breaks the rule with two leading men who are both better looking and younger (or at least younger looking). Chris Pine and Tom Hardy are terrific and don't need a leading lady as long as they have each other. Kind of like George Clooney and Brad Pitt in Oceans 11, 12 & 13. They also don't need potty mouth, over the hill non-actor Chelsea Handler who brings down the movie every time she appears on screen. Chelsea Handler a 40 something ""comedian"" is famous for bullying a 20 something unwed mother from Alaska. I've read that in order to get a PG-13 rating they had to excise some of Ms. Handler's dialogue. Not to worry, in order to get their money back her scenes will probably be included in the Special Features section of the DVD. Thank God for DVDs so you can fast forward through the scenes with Ms. Witherspoon & Ms. Handler and concentrate on the scenes with Mr. Pine and Mr. Hardy.

I like the story-line even though similar plots have been made; the difference is in the execution, and it was done well. I agree that the most enjoyable pairing is when Pine and Witherspoon goes out. The ""other"" guy,Tom Hardy,is just so-so. He lacked the charisma or looks to be competing with Chris Pine. In fact he was quite a bore. Reese is in her element,doing what Reese does best,cute and perky. I am less complementing regarding Chelsea Hendler. To me she is just saying her lines, and she wasn't photographed well at all. We all know she is a much better looking woman than what the photography did for her in this movie.

AN ANTAGONIST IN A ROM COME! There is this guy that the two agents try and get at the beginning of the movie and he causes problems randomly.The acting was borderline bad. Chris Pine was his normal pretty boy character that he does in a lot of movies. Don't get me wrong, he is good when he wants to be, but often times he plays the same character. Tom Hardy is still his great self, being the biased guy that I am, he did another great job, except this movie isn't good. Reese didn't have her spoon in this one either. She was just there to be pretty and say things, she didn't really develop at all. She is the same girl throughout the entire movie.The camera was OK, there was a couple good shots, but nothing to recommend the movie to someone for.The soundtrack was pretty good, it was filled with some popular songs that made some cool moments (I'm talking about the opening scene). The soundtrack didn't effect the movie as a whole though, it was just there.This Means War was entertaining for one viewing, I would only watch it again if my parents, SO, or friends wanted to watch it.

Personally I hate when Hollywood does the typical ""womanizer turns into a good guy for the right girl"" thing b/c frankly it just doesn't happen in the real world. And movies that portray it that way are just giving sad single women hope and the belief that it actually DOES happen. My husband and I are friends with plenty of hot womanizing men and they've been with AMAZING girls TONS of times and every single time they break up with them when they get bored. It's a fact of life. So on a personal level it aggravated me that she would choose FDR over the gorgeous guy that she had so much chemistry with (and met FIRST!!).

I really haven't seen a truly good and funny American comedy in years.They moved to TV.I'm trying to find specific things to say what was so wrong, but there was too much of it. Firstly, I don't buy the bromance between FDR and Tuck. You just don't see the closeness they talk so much about. No.2, Chelsey Handler is soooo annoying, I actually hoped she'd die when Tuck blew her tires. The whole movie has just too much talking and talking and talking without saying anything (a good movie for politicians LOL). For me, personally, a good movie is quite the opposite - saying with very little talking (guess that is why Woody Allen annoys me so much).Actually, the only decent performance came from Til Schweiger and I hoped he'd be the last one standing.And, one more thing, since I'm from Serbia and can't help mentioning, since Sokolov and Tuck talk in Serbian: Sokolov is not a Serbian name, it's Russian.

125,adam_evans14,Decent i suppose,6,4 July 2012,"Having just watched this means war, its fair to say its exactly what i expected beforehand, a light hearted spy comedy with some amusing moments. Problem is, i don't think either of the main actors should play parts like this. Hardys track record of late playing more serious roles may be a little boring for him, hence the switch in genre here, but lets be fair nobody is going to finish watching this film and claim ""Hardy really should do more comedy instead of what hes been doing"". You just know there's a dozen actors who are more fitting for this film than these two guys. Its not just that the wrong actors are cast, but there seems a lack of chemistry as a result between the two and scenes of antagonism between the two don't appear as cynical as you'd expect. Don't get me wrong, this is a comedy so there shouldn't be a massive bust up and quarrels ensue, but i'd like to actually believe the situation a little more. Better chemistry between the two would make everything all the more credible.With all this in mind, the two aren't on screen together all that much and the films narrative plays out as 'one goes on a date, the other goes on a date, one ruins a date, the other ruins a date'. And repeat. You basically know something is going to happen as a consequence of the scene directly previous.Through abuse of power both men set teams onto 24 hour surveillance to get to know the girl better and discover their flaws. The abuse of power is an interesting aspect and one of the best moments of the film comes from Hardy hijacking Pines feed about famous art paintings. I thought this was the highpoint, very funny.Since a standard rom/com film has been done to many different interpretations, the spy element is a refreshing idea and its a shame the potential for the idea was realised to the max. So since both are spy's, the films subplot must contain a bit of action for our female lead to become damsel in distress for the films climactic scenes. My problem with this is so little attention is paid to the subplot it needn't be there in truth. Ideally had the script been better the romantic plot and action plot would have inter wined more neatly.I thought at the end of the film, a cool but maybe corny ending would have been for whichever she chose, to refuse the continue the relationship having seen their friend hurt by her.This film isn't bad and has some humorous moments which is why i'll rank it 6/10. It has its flaws with casting (compare the chemistry in wedding crashers to this if you're not convinced) and a lack of realisation for its potential (i kinda felt this about the producers as well...i heard the plot, thought it had great potential, and it didn't quite deliver as expected) but overall if you're about the house and bored, there's no harm in tuning in if it were ever to be on TV.",This Means War
126,Maarten1985,A Fairly Entertaining Movie,6,5 January 2013,"Before watching This Means War, I spent some time looking at reviews. I was surprised to read so much negative about it that I was a little bit worried about what I might discover. I began watching This Means War without any expectations. What I found was a fairly entertaining movie.Agreed. It's not a masterpiece. But it's not very bad either. I have seen movies far, far worse.If you're expecting an action movie or a comedy with lots of laughter, then you will be disappointed. The A story of This Means War is about two men having feelings for the same woman. The B plot about the dangerous criminal only adds a little to the main story, but adds nothing new and is mostly unimportant. The movie also focuses on the A story so much that you tend to forget the B plot.What makes this movie work are the three main actors, Chris Pine, Tom Hardy and Reese Witherspoon, and the chemistry between them. Without these three specific actors, This Means War would have done worse.This Means War did make me laugh and smile from time to time, but not in the means that I consider it to be a comedy. It's rather a kind of light-romantic / light-comedy movie with a Disney-like happy end.To conclude: This Means War is a fairly enjoyable movie to watch with your partner. But don't get your expectations too high.+++ 6.5 / 10 +++",This Means War
127,JasonKleeberg,This Means Bore,5,22 February 2012,"My bias...Loves: Action movies. Likes: Tom Hardy Dislikes: Most romantic comedies Hates: Reese WitherspoonI went into this movie with low expectations. First off, it's got Reese Witherspoon, who I can't stand. She's annoying, smarmy and unattractive. Second, it's directed by McG, who for my tastes, misses in theaters (the Charlie's Angels series, Terminator Salvation). That being said, I know McG has the potential to entertain me, having produced one of my favorite TV shows of all time, the guilty pleasure known as Fastlane. My expectations were checked at the door.Chris Pine and Tom Hardy play off of each other quite well. Tom Hardy I bought as a CIA agent, in terms of attitude and build. Pine, not as much. Reese Witherspoon is just kind of...there...as the love interest. The story is fairly cookie-cutter like one may expect going in...two CIA agents accidentally kill a bad guy. That bad guy's brother lives, and plots revenge. In the meantime, the two CIA agents start dating the same girl, causing friction in their relationship. The story is nothing new, but is adequate.They are marketing this movie as an action/romantic comedy. The action in the movie is done very poorly - mostly quick cuts and off screen bullet wounds (for examples of how action scenes should be shot, see Haywire). The action set pieces are few and short. There are a few laughs, although the severely over the top character Chelsea Handler plays gets old quick. The ending of the movie is quite ridiculous, and makes little sense...sadly, I saw what was going to happen about a mile away, so if you see a lot of movies, you can see where the movie is heading.I don't regret seeing this movie, but I probably won't watch it again. The action isn't gratifying enough and the comedy isn't funny enough. You will forget about this movie within 24 hours of seeing it.Score: 5/10",This Means War

And no it's not in on the joke really, it's a romantic comedy but definitely isn't self aware. Watching it knowing that makes it better if anything though. And seriously the dialogue will have you cracking up that anyone thought it sounded good or real. Everything about it is just the worst. So all in all, very enjoyable...",This Means War

130,simonheranig,If best friends fall in love with the same woman,7,12 March 2019,An entertaining action comedy with the little touch of a love story. Always pretty funny sequences between these two guys matching each other,This Means War
131,big_ryan15,Can you tell it was directed by McG?,5,18 March 2012,"McG must have watched one too many cartoons when he was a kid- how else will you explain his obsessive love for them? After venturing into more mature territory with the inspirational sports drama 'We Are Marshall' and the sci-fi thriller 'Terminator: Salvation', the director is back making live-action cartoons in the vein of his 'Charlie's Angels' duo- logy, and 'This Means War' sees him at his most indulgent. Indeed, there is nothing that can be taken seriously about this loud, preposterous and utterly logic-less action comedy that requires that its audience to check every brain cell at the door just so they can watch two handsome hunky CIA agents go at each other to win the affections of the same girl.That is the only catch of this lazily plotted movie from Timothy Dowling and Simon Kinberg- the former an actor turned writer who sadly demonstrates little of the subversive cleverness from his earlier 'Role Models' nor the broad but nonetheless inspired hilarity of 'Just Go With It'; and the latter an experienced hand at the genre (responsible for the studio's earlier hit 'Mr and Mrs Smith') enlisted to polish the banter and distract the audience from the glaring plot-holes. Neither writer tries hard enough, and without a solid well-grounded script to rein in McG's fluffy excesses, the result is a 'Smith' wannabe without the entertainment.To be sure, a film like this is always going to be as good as its individual gags, and so to trick you into the theatre, the trailer showcases the best the film has to offer. Remember the one where Agent Tuck (Tom Hardy) shoots a dart right into Agent FDR's (Chris Pine) neck so he falls fast asleep just before he is about to bed the girl Lauren (Reese Witherspoon)? Or the one where Lauren accidentally shoots a paintball at Tuck's crotch while attempting to discharge its triggering mechanism? Trust us, these individual sequences in the movie don't go beyond what the trailer already shows, so you're not really missing anything more.The banality of the rest of the movie is only made more apparent by the one-note characterisation. Tuck and FDR are both good-natured sensitive guys equally eligible, while Lauren is the pretty attractive girl with no luck at love. Then just to add in a shade of raunch because 'Bridesmaids' showed there was a place for girls to be talking dirty, Lauren has a perpetually horny best friend Trish (Chelsea Handler) whose only purpose is to goad Lauren to have sex with Tuck and FDR. At no point do you care if Tuck or FDR get the girl, simply because either guy is just as shallowly drawn.Ditto for the tired banter between Tuck and FDR, scripted without the wit nor the punch of Kinberg's 'Smith' or 'Sherlock Holmes'- in fact, the most memorable line is delivered by a fellow agent who tries politely to tell Tuck the night after FDR beds Lauren that the latter had 'entered the premises'. Fortunately, there is genuine bromantic chemistry between the two actors Pine and Hardy, both of whom do their best with the trite material that doesn't do justice to their heretofore-unknown sharp comedic timing.Against their natural bromance, Reese Witherspoon ends up regrettably nondescript, giving as little as the script demands of her. That the romance between Lauren and Tuck or FDR doesn't ring true is not entirely the actress' fault however- for some inexplicable reason, the script has them falling in love over a private trapeze session at an amusement park and a private showcase of Gustav Klimt masterpieces at some warehouse. Granted that a suspension of belief is de rigueur for most movies, but the leap of logic this McG live-action cartoon demands is just too absurd.And don't get us started about the poorly conceived action sequences that are so badly choreographed it's no wonder they are over before you know it. We're not just talking about over-the-top, but absolutely head- scratching nonsense that turns the pair of CIA agents into superheroes who pretty much emerge unscathed- except for some cuts- from every supposed life-endangering situation. Even with the paucity of such sequences (we count only three in total), McG can't even get the climax right- and a high-speed chase that ends on a dead-end freeway ramp is so laughably shot it goes in the running for the worst action sequence of the year.Whether as action or as comedy, this mishmash of a buddy picture, spy thriller and rom-com fails in every regard. We can accept a movie that doesn't take itself seriously, but one that disregards every ounce of logic ultimately causes its audience to pay little attention to it as well. Like I said, it's really another one of McG's live-action cartoons- how else really can two spies use the full resources of the CIA to spy on a personal subject without anyone raising any alarm- and it is as juvenile as its titular claim that two guys fighting over one girl could really mean war. Not must see stuff by any measure.",This Means War
132,feudalserfer,Thank God I didn't pay at the cinema to see this movie!,5,16 July 2012,"This film had all the ingredients of being entertaining, fun and engaging. But it misses the mark somehow. It should have been my kind of movie, but it wound up annoying me.Three great young leads (to someone of my advancing years Reese Witherspoon is still young, though I do think she should be looking towards heavier roles now, as she can actually act), a reasonably amusing premise and the opportunity for a few decent comedy action scenes.Having rented the DVD I didn't see the three letters that would have saved me the outlay of both time and money: McG, ruiner of the Terminator franchise, amongst other sins. His direction is about as subtle as a brick through a window and has all the lightness of touch of a gorilla in a glass factory.That said, Hardy and Pine make a decent buddy partnership and Witherspoon is enticing enough to believe that two best mates could actually go to war over her affections. However, we never even get past two dimensions with the clunky dialogue and clichéd photofit characters, including a baddie actually called Heinrich, and an annoying slutty best friend (Chelsea Handler). Worse still, the gorgeous Angela Bassett is sinfully underused.I don't mind any of the above at all. After all I enjoyed True Lies, in which I believed yet again, Arnold Schwarzenegger, was a regular American guy and not an Austrian body builder in any way. But This Means War is a wasted opportunity, and at the end of the movie, I would have been quite happy for the three of them to plunge over the edge of the precipice with the stereotyped baddie.Near miss, rather than Epic Fail, but the latter can often be amusing in a way This Means War just was not.

The most interesting about the story is the 'stalking' facilities they used. Look how a man can be crazy just because of a woman and not just a competition. They are agents so they used their hi-tech facilities to conduct several breach. That's cool.It's a funny movie with ordinary action and drama. But it was a good casts choice. I saw Tom Hardy played on Warrior (2011) and he was totally different with Tuck in this movie. He played a real agent part so well. Reese, I don't know, but I liked how she played her part in this movie and I think she's a great choice. Til Schweiger played a very small part of this movie and didn't do anything particularly attractive which I think it's a waste. A little more fight with Heinrich I think would add something positive to this movie.It could have been a great movie but so many unrealistic and bad details inside especially in action part. Agents ordered by their superior with weird orders but doesn't have any complain for that. I'm just confused. Well, that's a lame story. I thought they eventually get caught by their captain but they're not. For me, the ending was bad and too predictable. It could have been better but end up just ordinary.",This Means War

The chemistry between Chris Pine and Tom Hardy was kinda cool. However, it was hard for me to accept Tom Hardy as a cool guy because the influence he made on me with his previous roles but yeah he did a good job.

Overall, Harmless, for sure, and bad in standard romantic comedy ways, so on that curve it's not the worst thing. If the film thought about what it was saying or doing, it might be embarrassed.

150,sarakitty05,Don't see what the complaints are about,7,23 July 2012,"I was reading the comments and I'm disappointed to see that not many people enjoyed it.The movie is not supposed to be taken seriously, nor realistically. If you sit down and analyze it, of course it is going to seem creepy and illegal. But if you take it from a romantic-comedy and friendship sort of movie, that's when it is enjoyable.Two best friends, Tuck and FDR, end up falling for the same girl, Lauren. They both end up dating her, and claim ""may the best man win"". I don't feel he did, but that's just my opinion.Overall the movie, with its high speed chases, romantic dates and ever-tested (yet hilarious at times) friendship between Tuck and FDR, is quite good. Apart from a random CIA chase that isn't really explained and serves only as the means to explain how the two male protagonists meet, watching one friend try and sabotage the other proves more hilarious than it sounds. Chris Pine plays a playboy and non serious FDR well, although I gotta say, I didn't find myself rooting for him, because I don't feel his actions were worthy of reward (lying, philandering...). Rather, my vote was for Tom Hardy (tuck), who with his charming, gentlemanly, British attractive self would make a much more suitable partner and choice. He plays him extremely well, and this is the movie where I first fell in love with the man (The dark knight rises would further that love). Reese Witherspoon and Chelsea Handler were also great, but honestly, I was so focused on the bromance that they were just a side thought.Overall, this movie is too be taken lightly. Get too hunkered down in the politics of it and it becomes nothing but a sadistic, creepy movie. It's not supposed to highly the fact that they are taking certain measures to get a girl; rather, its supposed to represent the question: would you go all the way to get a girl, if it meant sabotaging and eventually losing your most cherished friendship?",This Means War

Tom Hardy, wow, his acting in this was appalling, in the more intimate scenes towards the end he has this smile underneath his face the whole time and cannot say one line without blinking about 1000 times in order to cover it up.The action in this film is also very bare. There's a chunk at the beginning, middle and end - that's all! Witherspoon was OK, and her friend did well in making the film a little more funny however still, I didn't feel at all like I wanted to know what happened next nor did I care what happened to any of the characters.A poor attempt to make a good rom-com, it could've been great, maybe Jennifer Aniston would've helped (only joking), but it was just too stereotypical and none of the characters were memorable, apart from Witherspoon's friend.That is all.",This Means War

The plot was dull and silly and all-around average. The acting was great though, and I especially loved Chelsea Handler's character.

She used to be my favorite romcom queen, but ever since i saw her in ""how do you know"" i kinda lost interest in her. And now this!And now, to the film...This film is fun but very implausible. The fact that two CIA agents would go great length to win the girl of their dreams is ridiculous. The wire tapping and secret cameras were silly stunts. There's just no logic to their actions and not enough reliable evidence to why she fell in love with one of them. It's shallow. Chelsea was funny. The only problem i had with her is her instant change of perspective towards the end. There was no scene that showed why she felt the way she did. It just threw me off.Overall, I can only watch this once cuz it doesn't evoke any feelings from me. Just too silly and not enough chemistry.",This Means War
157,markthetranny,Where did it go wrong?,3,1 May 2012,"I saw trailers for this in the cinema and considered going to see it.  Thankfully I didn't waste £8 paying for a ticket. The premise for this  seemed great- OK reminiscent of True Lies- but there seemed to be  potential for comedy and drama. Potential that is sadly never realised.  Tom Hardy and Chris Pine are both charming leads (Pine needs to stop  doing that chewing with his mouth open thing)Reese Witherspoon is possibly a little old for this kind of  role- or at least this kind of role with Hardy and Pine- but she plays  the role well enough.  The problem is that there is no plot to speak of, very little action  and precious few laughs. The film is beautifully lit but the editing is  horrible. It reminds the viewer of Quantum of Solace with its action  sequences that could be memorable except the viewer can't see what is  happening. It doesn't look a cheap film and the cast and premise could  have made for something memorable but how could the end result be so  unsatisfying. Vapid, bland, predictable and empty its like overdosing  on cake icing because there is no cake underneath.  All the way through I couldn't help wonder how so much could have gone  wrong until as the end credits rolled I saw it was directed by McG .  Nothing more to be said.",This Means War
158,kirkmccoy,Potential for a fun story not met,5,26 August 2012,"I was so frustrated with this movie. Based on what was seen on screen I did not believe that FDR and Tuck were CIA agents. This subplot was never properly explained. Who was this bad guy and what was the devise they were supposed to secure? A little background would have been helpful. As to the romantic aspect of this comedy, it would have been so much better if three of the scenes that had been cut were included. The first scene was the one shortly after Lauren met both guys and was describing them to Trish. It explained the chemistry that was present between Lauren and FDR. And her friend Trish was hysterical in this scene doing a riff. The other scene was between the two guys at the CIA shooting range that was in the same time frame as the previous scene. They had some great dialog and again an explanation of how Lauren had gotten under FDR's skin and how Tuck was able to see through him. And the last hilarious scene that should have been added was the one where Lauren compares the guys to two large cooking knives in front of the focus group. Without these scenes I really didn't connect with these characters. I wish the director would create a new director's cut and add these scenes back. I really hate having to go to these scenes on my blu-ray and play them after watching the film. I would watch anything Chris Pine acted in over and over. He and the other actors were not served well by the director whose commentary on the film showed how much he was not happy with what he had done.",This Means War

Not to worry, as her friend Trish (Chelsea Handler, once again typecast) is eager to help, posting the picture of Lauren doing a keg handstand during a Spring Break. (Not like she was trying to embarrass Lauren)FDR and Tuck are the best of friends, tied not only by camaraderie of working together for CIA, but, also by having been truly close friends for better part of their lives. Their work relationship is seamless, while their personal lives could not be anymore different.FDR is a ladies man, while Tuck is still pining for his estranged wife and son, trying to be the best father he can, while putting on the official facade of a meek travel agent.Through the magic of Internet, Tuck and Lauren meet, and, through sheer circumstance, so do FDR and Lauren. What ensues is a true credit to proper writing, as at no point in time does the movie ever feel stale, dry, or boring.Director McG sees the action and comedy tied in amazing bouquet of excitement, laughter, and pure joy at having such a cliché topic being treated like the masterpiece it is.The best part? Watching the movie twice in a row still made me laugh and revel in joy. The worst part? Til Schweiger, as the accidental villain, is given miserably short screen time, with next to nothing as far as the character development.

That was in ""Sweet Home Alabama"". Other similar scripts and situations compare with ""Legally Blonde"" and ""Heaven Can Wait"". It's like each of her films borrows from the previous one. Not a bad formula, but certainly not very original. I think this was her worst movie ever, and I have ALL of her movies. I can't imagine her kids seeing it anytime soon without thinking, ""Gosh mom! Why did you make it???"" I think Chelsea Handler had a lot to do with it. Yuk! And, of course, $12 million dollars.",This Means War
162,htmidas,"Predictable, but surprisingly entertaining",7,9 February 2013,"I had no interest in seeing this when it was first advertised, but I caught it on TV the other day and I was actually pleasantly surprised. It was an hour and a half of total ridiculousness: spy versus spy, going to increasingly extreme lengths to win over Lauren (Reese Witherspoon), but it worked because this movie definitely didn't take itself seriously and the actors worked well together. There was great chemistry between Chris Pine (""FDR"" is a silly name) and Lauren, between Tuck (Tom Hardy) and Lauren, and - most importantly - between Pine and Tuck. Chelsea Handler did a nice job as Lauren's friend Trish, the CIA agents Tuck and Pine exploit to aid their campaigns added a hilarious element to the movie, and overall everyone worked well together to make this truly funny.That's not to say that this totally revolutionized the romcom genre; it was fairly predictable. Of course these two friends try to remain friends as they pursue the same woman and promise to be gentlemen about it, but of course they both get out of control and then get mad at one another and then make up at the end because c'mon, they're best friends! Also, there is no satisfying way to end this kind of story. Obviously they both can't end up with Lauren, but one of them has to, otherwise you've entirely wasted the movie's relationship development (as opposed to only half-wasting it). I think they do a pretty good job of not letting you know which one she chooses until near the end, although I definitely guessed correctly well before the ""big reveal,"" and there is sort of a consolation prize for the one she doesn't choose. Some humor in the very last scene makes the happy ending less sappy: it got a chuckle instead of an eye roll from me, so that's a success by romcom standards.There really weren't very many action scenes (the ""spy"" element was essentially all in the gadgetry and invasion of each other's privacy) and the editing was a little weird at times - I kept thinking ""now's where they go to commercial"" and then remembering that this was a movie. That's about all you'll get from me about technical things, though; all I can say is that nothing was overly distracting from my perspective.If you're looking for something light and funny and fairly brainless, see This Means War, it's a lot of fun.",This Means War

All of the sets and styling, from the opening party, to the private homes and offices of the characters are aesthetically stunning and covetous to look at. It's a cute and silly bromance and romance.

I advise not bringing any drinks with you into the movie theater, because you will probably not be able to hold your urine in from laughter. With outrageous and non-stop comedy, this incredible movie will be noted without a doubt as one of 2012's best comedies. The movie is also action packed, and has a very interesting and surprising end. So if you want to enjoy some mind-blowing comedy with a touch of romance and Hollywood action, this movie is the perfect choice. The movie has a PG-13 rating, so make sure you are aware of it. The action scenes are very light for a PG-13 movie. However, the jokes are sex- related and there are 2 intense sensuality scenes.

I guess it ended like i hoped Tuck with his son and wife, and FDR with Lauren, regardless of Tuck and Lauren were great together but they didn't have the chemistry like FDR and Lauren together I guess FDR is the perfect match for her. I wished they choose another actress instead of Reese don't get me wrong she is good but not that much.

168,LiamCDuncan,"It was pretty good, until the ending....",5,3 July 2013,"In my experience, the most important and pivotal part of a movie in the ending, and the conclusion of this story was just awful. I saw what they were trying to do at the end there, they wanted a conclusion that was a ""happy ending"" in a fashion, a good result for everyone, I would have gone a different way. If you see it on TV, go for it, because the first 3/5ths is actually pretty good. But after that, you'd be better off making up your own ending. This is where the SPOILING begins. Now this is how I would have ended the movie: the car accident happens the dust clears from the situation that would have made Reese Witherspoon's character choose between Tom Hardy's character and that of Chris Pine, revealing that she had actually just dropped strait down on the ground infront of her, choosing neither of them. Instead she chose one and, the other character( I decided not to totally ruin it) is just OK, and they remain friends. Uh-uh, nope, not a thing, stuff like that tears close friends apart, completely, and unforgivably. And then the other character just gets back into an old relationship. Things don't happen like that, and the scene in the plane in the credits, what was that?! Just unnecessary.

The incident which allows the two most hard hitting agents to fight for love is amazing. The story can be predicted but it has certain ends which makes you laugh and enjoy the moment. Even if the story is predictable at times, it doesn't bore you, instead you move with the story ahead and enjoy it even more. Reese Witherspoon, Chris Pine and Tom Hardy gives great performances and Chelsea Handler as Trish is equally supporting and funny at times. There are certain movies in which the actor shines with his or her performance, but this movie is all about the makers who have given a beautiful script the perfect directorial edge which makes it look much better.

For the unfortunate woman she goes suddenly from having no male attention (not really believable but there you have it) to have two virile, interesting and attractive men pursuing her.This is where the high comedy should begin: but it is very ham-fisted and relies heavily on over the top action and sexual innuendo. The banter is forced, and the jokes are too predictable.We, the viewers, see that of the two men, Tuck (the less attractive one) is upfront and genuine, and Franklin (the more attractive one) is rather deceitful and willing to lie to impress the girl. However, the deceitful one actually falls for the girl and scorns all the other women is currently sleeping with to be with Lauren. The script gave no plausibility for this change, and even within the genre it is a bit too much.We know which one she chooses - the more attractive one of course!!! And somehow she manages to maintain the relationship when she realises that Franklin know absolutely nothing about Klimt, and really does not help out at the animal shelter, and is impossibly egocentric.But since this is a romantic comedy, Tuck couldn't be left out in the cold - no, there is another woman brought in to save him from loneliness.",This Means War

I did not understand why the 'critics' said it was bland, thrilless, laughless, and anything -less in their reviews. I enjoyed the movie very much. It was funny. Granted, if you watched this for the action sequence (and after watching Haywire the day before), you'd find it a bit faux. A bit too Hollywood. However, just enjoy all the blasts, hi-tech gadgets, and lavish apartments. (I wonder if real agents watched this and told themselves: ""Yeah, right""). A spy's life couldn't be that glamour, right? Although I found more bromance than romance, don't let it be an obstacle to enjoy the movie. Reese Witherspoon is quite funny, a bit pitiful single (and we all bonded over the fact), and quirky as ever. Chris Pine, as the 'rake' type, and Tom Hardy as the 'good-guy-next-door' type. Their interaction was quite good. At least, we believed that we they were best friends. Opposites attract (Tom and Chris, not Reese/Tom or Reese/Chris).

Instead of setting myself up for failure, I approached ""This Means War"" differently: expecting nothing at all.Although the character's love interest felt pretty genuine, and the story was plausible enough I still left the theater feeling unsatisfied. For a movie targeted towards a more adult audience, I couldn't help but look away from the screen thanks to the childish and campy dialogue. Unfortunately the action scenes were few and far between, so there was plenty of talking. Additionally, the cast was mediocre at best, and special effects were far from jaw-dropping.In its defense, I do appreciate how ""This Means War"" partially switches the stereotyped roles of men and women. Instead of men juggling women, they fight for commitment (and vice versa). Otherwise, this movie has nothing new to offer. Friendships being manipulated and torn apart over mutual feelings for the same girl it's been done before.While this movie certainly isn't right for everyone, I can see it being a solid choice for a date night. (still) attractive Reese Witherspoon and occasional action scene is enough to leave most men content.

It's pretty juvenile actually, more suited to an audience of 18 to 23 year olds at best.The track of the villain that runs in the background is a waste. Nor is there any real point in the main characters being CIA agents, apart from the surveillance. This movie could have been any other movie about 2 friends competing for the affections of a girl. It hackneyed, and it's utterly, utterly predictable. The writers and the director could have employed some creativity & vision to rescue such a banal premise, but they didn't.I looked up the director after watching this.

185,hellokitty_9,Enjoyed this movie,7,21 February 2012,I have to say that I quite enjoyed this movie. In my opinion Chris and Tom were casted perfectly for the roles that they had. They were funny and it didn't seem as if they were trying too hard. Reese was great as well. There were enough action scenes and just enough romance for both a guy and girl to watch it. I'm surprised that this movie didn't do that great in the theatres because it's pretty good. Chelsea was hilarious in this movie and I would say this something I would rent when it comes on DVD.Chris Pine surprised me here as I have not seen him in other movies rather than Star Trek. This guy deserves more credibility in Hollywood in my opinion and he's not bad to look at either. I quite liked Reese' portrayal of Lauren and somehow she manages to seem so youthful and relevant in her character.,This Means War
186,flickchick1909,"Great fun, lots of laughs and gorgeous men....",8,6 February 2012,"I was lucky enough to be invited to a screening in Sydney of This Means War.FDR (Pine) and Tuck (Hardy, with his English accent in tact.YAY!!) are CIA agents and best friends. They would, literally, take a bullet for one another. When they discover they are dating the same woman, Lauren (Witherspoon), all bets are off. They decide to let Lauren decide who she wants to be with and.well boys will be boys.The movie gets off to a cracking pace with a very cool opening scene. We have impossibly handsome CIA agents sauntering across the room targets in sight, said targets batting eyelashes for all their worth, bad guys showing up and ruining the oh-so-suave pick up lines. Then comes the CIA stuff. We have helicopters full of bad guys and cash, guns firing, glass breaking, slick spy sliding across the floor while firing gun moves, tall buildings being leapt from, tall buildings being thrown from, thugs, more guns. YEAH!!! Alas, this has all been a monumental screw up and our agents are grounded. Yep desk bound for the foreseeable future. And they are bored, bored, bored.Enter Lauren, a gorgeous consumer products tester/reviewer who winds up dating both FDR and Tuck. Both men are very different personalities and how she ends up dating both of them is charming and genuinely funny. Lauren only falls for one guy initially.Speaking of funny, Chelsea Handler is absolutely hilarious in this movie. Laugh out loud hilarious. She plays Trish, the perfect rude, crude and no nonsense counterpart to Witherspoon's sweet and slightly wounded Lauren. The scenes with Lauren and Trish are some of the movie's funniest with Handler throwing down the one liners with perfect comedic timing.When FDR and Tuck discover they are both dating Lauren, they do the gentlemanly and honorable thing.they set about sabotaging each other's love life. This is where the real fun begins.Remember how I said these men were bored? Well bored men with the entire CIA arsenal of technologies, gimmicks and let's face it, really cool stuff at their disposal promises just one thing..great fun. Covert teams are selected, covertly of course, and as they say, hilarity ensures.Both men have their qualities, both men have their flaws. I couldn't choose who I was cheering for. When I started wanting one to get the girl, I changed my mind with the next scene and wanted the other to win her. Even their teams start to become invested in their little side operation, providing some very funny moments.This is a great, fun, funny and romantic movie. The pace never lets up and the laughs keep coming. It has enough chick stuff to draw out some genuine awwwws from the audience and enough CIA agent/boy stuff to keep the fellas more than entertained. I will be going to see it again once it's at the cinemas.This Means War opens February 14 (in Australia) and would be the most perfect movie for Valentine's Day. Even if you don't have a Valentine this year, get a group of friends together and go see it anyway..plus you won't have to share your popcorn with anyone.Oh and yes, Lauren does pick her true love..",This Means War
187,ajgwaller,If you go in expecting a chick flick you will be pleasantly surprised,6,25 March 2012,"This movie was somewhat a reluctant watch for me but I was pleasantly surprised. A typical date night movie with the girlfriend but this movie shone out as one that really made me laugh and had enough humour to keep me interested for the duration of it.Set around a simple plot of two guys going for the same girl, the twist is these guys are both CIA Agents with access to unlimited resources of investigation, who knew how helpful this could be for wooing a girl. What could be more fun than someone already giving you a list of her likes and dislikes before a date? Seemingly providing the removal all the rookie mistakes men make when dating. What makes this movie most enjoyable is how both parties are so determined to get the girl they will go to all lengths to sabotage the others efforts. Given their access to CIA resources this is taken to all new levels.As the story develops it becomes less about the battle to get the girl and more about the friendship of two great friends and the affect this fight is having on them. This brings enough emotion into the movie for the girls to enjoy but isn't overplayed which is a refreshing change.Reese Witherspoon a consistent performer in chick flicks which was a major reason for my reluctant-ness to see this movie, however backed up well with the focus mainly being on her co-stars Chris Pine and Tom Hardy it worked well. The relationships didn't come across as genuine and certainly wouldn't be winning Oscars but was enough to keep me entertained.If you go in expecting a chick flick you will be pleasantly surprised. I give this movie 3 out of 5 stars in its genre. Have fun.",This Means War

Then SUDDENLY, she's irresistible to two incredible hotties? Nonsensical.If that weren't enough to turn you away: the dialog is forced and nonspecific, the chemistry is nonexistent, Witherspoon phones it in. There's also a plot ""twist"" anyone could spy a mile away.And if part of you is thinking ""well, hey at least it's sort of progressive and enlightened to have one woman dating two men instead of the typical reverse,"" stop. I'd venture 75% of the film is Witherspoon blabbering about how her ladybrain can't handle being with two (soooo wonderful and handsome and blahblahblah) men. Ladybrains, can't live with 'em, can't make basic decisions in life with them. I mean, right?!**not right",This Means War
192,punksharkchick,Great Movie! A must see and a must own!,10,18 February 2012,"I absolutely LOVED this movie. I have no idea why critics were giving it such horrible reviews but definitely do not listen to them. The trailers don't do this movie justice, and thats going on that because of the trailers I did want to see the movie, but its so much better than just what the trailers showed. Its a great mix of action and a romantic-comedy and each actor/actress hit their roll right on the nose. I loved that Chris Pine's character made a bit of a Shout Out to CHiPs, but I think me and only one other person got the joke in the theater. In case you didn't know, his dad was in CHiPs. The same with FDR's ""cover"" story of him being a ship captain which I thought was hilarious.But that was only one joke out of the many jokes and just situations the movie had. It has been awhile since I've seen a comedy that I laughed this much during with a nice balance of action at the same time. At least in my movie theater there were a bunch of guys there too and they seemed to have enjoyed the film as well. So an all around great movie for everyone 10/10 stars.",This Means War

Thankfully it didn't disappoint me.The idea of two best friends falling in love with the same woman is definitely not new but it is very well executed and the fact that they are both agents changes the dynamic quite a bit, because they can use observation.The characters are certainly klischées so are a lot of the jokes but I don't mind that at all since it was to be expected.Its good movie for an enjoyable time.",This Means War

But the ending was screwed up and unimaginative, leaving a sour after taste for a movie which gave quite a few funny moments in the first half. Maybe it's tough to pull off a nice ending with such movie but still as a viewed i would have liked to stop watching the movie halfway through when the funny bits ended. And yeah those were some funny bits, situational comedy and lame jokes but overall package made it interesting. Would definitely recommend this movie for one viewing (but only the first half), not enough juice to deserve a round 2 though. Oh and Reese looks really nice in that red dress.",This Means War
195,contactomkar,Good but not that good..!!!,6,18 May 2012,"I watched this movie just after watching Thor... as i had to catch the Avengers n it was the only character left to see... Anyways.. so basically i wanted to watch a light hearted one after watching a rather serious one.the film starts off well enough and i did have a few laughs.... but as soon as the so called ""This Means War"" plot begins..... its just free fall from there..... although Reese is the only saving grace all through the movie.. but that doesn't help much. The Movie basically Lacks a clear plot and ends up being a non moralistic comedy at the end.... Still not sure why Reese's Character chooses Chris' character.. just because they went to banggkkkok first...??? well you decide to yourself.... well.. want to watch a way better movie ....

196,nick0079,This Means War: Cliché but still manages to pull it off.,6,21 August 2012,"If you haven't already noticed, a lot of critics and even users alike have been bashing this movie, putting it down for its cliché nature and ""terrible plot and acting"". Personally i must say this is incorrect. This Means war i will strongly agree is most definitely another cliché ""guy v guy chasing after the same girl"". However this movie has a twist to it that not many others do. Our two guys happen to be two agents that are long standing best friends and partners. The character development in this movie is good; both Chris Pine and Tom Hardy personify their character exceptionally and one can get the full effect of the movie from their acting. Chris Pine acts as FDR Foster; our typical ladies man and Tom Hardy acts as Tuck; the British ""nice guy"" type. Two characters with different personalities chasing after a girl they both met after accepting that their romantic lives were a failure up until now. This makes for good conflict and i must say very good comedy. The movie packs in a well arranged set of jokes that will keep you watching and laughing throughout the movie. In conclusion; yes, This Means War is clichéd to a certain point and yes it is b no stretch of imagination a ""Gut busting comedy"" but it certainly deserves a watch on one of those casual movie nights where you're looking for entertainment and some laughter.",This Means War

Dating, comedy, action, romance and sex jokes peppered the whole thing and it moved quite well.Tom & Chris played exactly who they were supposed to, playboy type agents, who end up in a ""measuring"" contest over a well placed pretty blonde. Reese again has caught me off guard with her slightly neurotic, confused single woman role... (how do you know).I usually could do without Chelsea Handler and this was no exception, she did add a touch of rough comedy but I think a less brash ""best-friend"" could have fit the bill just fine.We laughed, we jumped, I ""aww""ed and it was good time.",This Means War

Personally I think ""This means war"" was one of the best romantic comedy movies among many...it is different in away, it has kind of a unique plot, interesting, with creative production that can touch senses magically.

Sure the action in it was terrible, but I still think that the movie had a good flow to it overall.This certainly isn't a movie I could have stopped watching after I saw the first 30 or 40 minutes. At first I thought that I wouldn't like it, but it really grew on me and I found myself really wanting to know who Reese's character, Lauren, would choose at the end.While I can see why some may really hate this one, I found it to be quite entertaining (and I'm one who usually doesn't care for romance films), but this one really doesn't feel like a full-on romance film.I'm very sure that some people will be able to find this very entertaining, while others may feel like it is the worst movie they have ever laid their eyes on.

201,MrUnimpressed,Hardy anyone will be pine'ing over this flop,4,22 February 2016,"Initially when I saw the poster i thought it would be worth watching, after all look at the big 3 cast members; Reese Witherspoon has won an Oscar and Tom Hardy is the man that portrayed the bane character better than I could have thought possible.What a disappointment, that's all I could piece together after watching this flop of a romantic comedy trying and failing to be an action.The story follows two elite CIA agents FDR (Chris Pine) and Tuck (Tom Hardy) after they are grounded for failing a mission in Hong Kong. Back on US soil the two fall for the same girl, Enter Lauren (Reese Witherspoon). They enter a gentleman's agreement to see who can steal Laurens heart. However the rules go out the window and the last thing on the men's mind is being gentlemanly. They implore their CIA skills on one another in a 'whatever it takes to get the girl' mentality. In her defence Reese played the role rather well however the two lead males left much wanting. The storyline is predictable with few laughs along the way which is why they have tried to shove obscenely designed action scenes down your throat to make you forget about the comedy you were promised but are still waiting for. It was a very bland, predictable film which has you checking your watch hoping, praying that it will end soon. I recommend next time you're at the video store just keep on walking and don't look back when you see this title. Mr Unimpressed remains very much unimpressed.",This Means War
202,LVmomt,Enjoyable ride,10,20 February 2012,"Lots of action, lots of comedy, and a very capable cast. The movie flowed pretty well and all of the funnier scenes were not in the trailer. You go in knowing the entire plot, but it doesn't matter because the movie has such a great flow, you forget you know where it's going.The characters were really well developed, and no one was a bad guy. This is the place where the movie lost it's gloss a bit. You like Tuck, and you like FDR. As a girl, either one of them is a fantastic choice, and you know you'll get the happily ever after. However, one guy obviously gets the girl in the end(FDR). So we as an audience don't feel too badly for Tuck, he gets the ex-wife back.Unfortunately, though, that only happens because she sees him on TV and realizes he's a secret agent. Had they thrown in a line earlier about her not trusting him because he travels far too much for a travel agent, as opposed to her just mentioning that he travels a lot for a travel agent, then it wouldn't have appeared as if she only wanted him back because he was cool.Overall, worth your 10 bucks to see it in the theater on a big screen.",This Means War

205,bja-28192,Left feeling empty.,1,18 January 2020,"I have never written a movie review before. I've never even had an account on IMDb. But the ending of this movie was so unbelievably disappointing that I literally felt compelled to write a review.Don't get me wrong, I actually really liked the movie up to the ending. It was funny, there was action. It wasn't the best movie in the world, but it certainly wasn't the worst. But you come to the end. Lauren has two options. The sexy, suave, ladies man who could not take no for an answer if it would save his life, and the cute, sweet, caring, maybe not as exciting or outgoing, but incredibly genuine guy. One genuinely wants to find his person, his love, his best friend for life, which is what Lauren wants too. The other wants to take yet another girl to bed. Then even after Lauren makes it incredibly clear that she's not interested in him, FDR takes things to creepy stalker levels to get Lauren to agree to a date. So at the end of the day, any friend who would still pursue a girl after clear negative signals, AND knowing your best friend is genuinely interested in the same girl, is a really awful friend. It should have been dropped there (maybe they find out after a few dates?) but whatever, this is more funny I guess? Putting that aside, after all the lying and deceitfulness from FDR, and, although collected rather shadily, simply finding out what Lauren likes from Tuck, Lauren still chooses FDR? I mean at the end it's even clear that Tuck risks his own life to jump in front of the vehicle to save Lauren, where FDR doesnt (FDR ends on the side, unmoved, with Lauren, Tuck is found in the centre rather than on his side where he was originally). So once again, the good looking jerk gets the girl, and the genuine nice guy is left sad and alone. I mean on its own its a awful ending because it just feels so wrong. It feels like it goes against the entire movie. The entire movie seems to not only put you on Tuck's side, but it makes you feel like FDR grows a heart and backs down. But no. Instead the message will be that being a terrible person gets you what you want, and as the saying goes, nice guys finish last. I literally felt so empty and disappointed and even sad that I could barely finish watching the movie. An ending much more disappointing than that of ""The Sopranos"".All in all, the movie was pretty decent, but the terrible ending ruins the entire thing for me and makes it not worth watching.",This Means War

209,the-forge,Great movie--Why are critics bashing? An actually funny comedy.,9,14 February 2012,"Okay, critics, what the hell? I saw this movie at 7:30 at Movieland: A Bow Tie Cinema in Richmond, VA. Great theater, props! Anyways. The theater was packed. It was the biggest screen, too, but it was the only showing. If the audience reaction was anything to go on, this movie was hilarious. I certainly thought so. But not only that—it was a good movie! Summary aside, this movie actually turned out to be one of my favorite romantic comedies and buddy comedies all in one. It was very fast-paced. It had the element of government agents, but also government agents that abuse their job's resources. There are 'bad guys' but it doesn't dominate the movie. The scenes with the bad guys start off with the preconception that they would be long and intense, but were actually only 60 seconds long and just a short break between the comedy and action. The funny parts—yes, they were funny. I was cracking up the entire time, and I don't do that often. Visually it looked amazing; watching on Blu-Ray will be spectacular. I, for one, will buy this on Blu-Ray. My roommate will thank me.Yes, young people like myself will enjoy this movie, but it's also targeted for late twenties-late thirties people thinking about love and marriage. I saw a lot of older couples at the theaters and they were enjoying it just as much—they were laughing loudest, in fact! I'd give this movie a 9/10. Pure enjoyment.So my issue: WTF Critics? You give this movie zero credit. Is it because of the actors? They're all great actors. Plot? Actually pretty good—somewhat predictable in hindsight but I'd still watch the movie again. Director? Supernatural and Nikita both have a fanbase, and aren't that bad with action or drama. If they actually watched the movies they wouldn't have rated it that low; I think they were going off plot summary. Back off, critics! When more people see this movie the ratings will go up! Rotten tomatoes said audience enjoyed it 71% so far, but opening day isn't even over yet. Critics give it 33%? Come on. (From tvcinema.tumblr.com (my blog) )",This Means War

It makes us normal guys think (maybe it is like that), that we are all the same and just have to compete - may the better one win - like shown in the trailer (or similar). The movie is filled with new (unknown) jokes and even some unexpected moments/situations, fast scenes, hot cars and of course love & friendship.

211,d-d-druid,"An absolute drag of a ""date"" movie - avoid at all costs",3,10 July 2012,"Viciously afraid of women, horribly written, and apparently phoned in by the cast over a weekend or two, this flick tries to satisfy both men and women in the audience through hackneyed appeals to gender stereotypes and ends up being the loudest snooze you'll ever experience. Men are choked by other men against abandoned strip-club poles (like, gross, Broseph!), makeup-slathered bodies of both sexes are bared in drab, sexless settings, and the main female character is so unappealing as to almost deserve her forced role as a stand-in for the eternal love-hate of two creepy men . . . for each other. (She doesn't actually deserve her mistreatment, of course, any more than the audience does theirs for deciding to watch this trash.) I'm not kidding about the male-male romance, by the way. The real love story here is between the two male characters. I'm not talking ""bromance"", either - these men are absolutely obsessed with each other, so much so that they forgo pursuing the girl to cuddle up and watch their hidden-camera movies of her together, late into the night. It's almost sweet, in a frighteningly repressed way.All of that still makes this movie sound much more exciting and sexy than it actually is. If it helps, ""This Means War"" is rated PG-13, and that's for gross-out humor, not any sort of nudity. The super-spy plot is an afterthought and merits maybe one-sixth to one-seventh of the on screen ""action"". Mostly, you'll see Chris Pine and Tom Hardy whining at each other as the camera flies wildly to the left and right.I could go on and on about its faults, but this movie doesn't deserve it. Mr. Pine must have signed onto this signature-McG travesty before he landed a gig for life as the new nerd-worshiped Captain Kirk, or at least I hope so.

Aren't their any qualified actors that don't need tattoos to show what a man they are? Then you have pretty boy sneaking into the house and planting who know what. A real low class move. I guess Sweet Home Alabama and Legally Blond were the high lights of some ones career. Too bad, because she played the 2 movies with a touch of comedy. Now it must be the $$$. The plot may be good at the inception, but strays when the competition between the two put the damsel in distress. Who to pick. Which one to trust. Are lies really lies.

217,sango_chang,No certain expectation,6,24 August 2012,I watched this movie without any certain expectation. I have already heard this movie from some of my friends who told me to watch this. So I just grabbed the DVD in my free time and watched. I could say the movie went well unless I did not see any chemistry between Lauren and Tuck or Lauren and FDR though the relationship between Lauren and FDR seems went better than with Tuck. The ending gives its best as it could be. Tuck got back his marriage and Lauren and FDR lasts. I think this movie is good drama and not the some action movie like I guessed first from the movie poster. However it's not so bad movie though its story is a bit cliché (even the storyline already improvised and adding the CIA and secret agent thing in movie) so I just recommend it to watch like you watch the other funny romantic drama.,This Means War

219,kylelikescod,I'm seeing a lot of feminist reviews:,7,24 March 2021,"Firstly, this movie is not as bad as the reviews- If you go into a type of movie like this with expectations, then you will be dissatisfied.The movie focuses on two CIA agents, Tuck and FDR, who are both attractive men who end up seeking out the same woman (Lauren Scott) without her knowing.Firstly, I'd like to to talk about the characters:Tuck (Tom Hardy) is a British Agent working for the CIA. His closest and only friend is FDR, his buddy from work. He is also divorced and trying to seek back his ex wife, but with not much luck. Tuck is a more traditional Romantic, who seeks out long term, more meaningful relationships. He is seen as the ""safe option"" for Lauren throughout the film.FDR Foster (Chris Pine) is an American agent working for the CIA. His closest and what appears to be only friend is Tuck. Foster is more of as described by Weatherspoon's character, ""a one night rental type of guy"", and seeks pleasure in sleeping with lots of different women, and doesn't have time for a relationship. He often comes across as cocky and arrogant, although it is obviously like that to show the contrast in personalities between Tuck and himself. He is seen by Lauren as a more mysterious guy, and she believes he can change and become a more compassionate man. This becomes more evident throughout the film as FDR makes a lot of compromises to impress Lauren.Lauren Scott (Reece Weatherspoon) is a successful business women who runs a product testing and recommendation company. She is seen to be almost a hopeless romantic, as she had broken up with her boyfriend and not took dating as seriously as she would like to. Lauren, like Tuck, has always been interested in having a deep and meaningful relationship, which is why her ending up with FDR at the end is ironic. She is often influenced by her best friend, who essentially forces her into dating two guys at once.Now moving on to the premise:I actually enjoyed the premise of the movie, despite what other people have said. I think it was clever and allowed for a complicated and competitive race to get Lauren. And I don't understand why people are getting so up tight about the whole ""spying"" aspect of the movie, it's a cheesy romantic-action movie, I don't think the idea of it was to condemn close spying on women. It was there to show how desperate they were and to what lengths they would go to beat each other. It changes the traditional ""couple of guys fighting for the girl"" into something a bit different, which I enjoyed. It also showed how much they actually cared about Lauren, and how far they would go to make her happy.One criticism I would have on the film is that the action could have been a bit more frequent, as the only real action was at the beginning, some in the middle in the Bar with the Russian men, and at the end. Although the paintball scene with Hardy was brilliant.Overall this film is a solid and a decent watch, I wouldn't watch it expecting action, but more just a funny laugh and a bit of a stupid premise.",This Means War
220,cardaristocrat,Unexpectedly well-written and gorgeous comedy,9,9 February 2012,"You may have seen trailers for this terrible-looking romantic comedy about two CIA agents who fight over the same girl. My friend and I attended an advance screening with the expectation that I would hate the movie.We loved it.The movie was a delight from start to finish. It was gorgeous, for one thing, and I am not just talking about the actors, although they're gorgeous, too. The cinematography is splendid. Furthermore, the characters were actually multi-dimensional, including Lauren Scott (Reese Witherspoon), the woman in question. Far from being a trophy, she was smart, competent, and talented, and she had her own issues to work out and her own lessons to learn about love. Although the movie was undeniably more about the men than it was about her, I didn't feel like she was just there to motivate them, which is always a danger in this type of romantic comedy. The theme of the movie was communicated through her as well as through the men—which brings me to my next point: the movie actually had themes and character development. I typically expect only to be entertained by a comedy, not to be impressed in any intellectual way, but in addition to being nonstop hilarious and occasionally moving, this one was all over proper writing technique.My friend and I ended up being completely in love with it, and we cannot wait for the official release so that we can share it with all of our other friends and see it again ourselves.",This Means War

We had already seen all the other movies they were showing there and decided to give this one a try.It turned out to be a really funny, interesting film. It had enough action to hold the interest for the action lovers, and threw in enough ""chick flick"" material to hold the attention of the female audience.

It was hilarious, the jokes weren't cheesy (btw,I laughed at all the jokes in the movie) and there was quite a fair amount of action in it. However, if you're looking for an action movie I don't think this is for you. The movie was ard 70% comedy , 30% action. Granted, the villain was poorly done. He only has about 10-15 min of footage in the movie which sucks and also the cgi was fake as hell.

FDR is a real jerk and suddenly become good guy! and in other hand first he doesn't believe in LOVE but ""DIRECTOR"" wanna tells us that such a jerk (FDR who already once slept with his best friend's girl and now she is his wife) changed in 1 hour and blah blah blah This movie was a real garbage, disrespect to viewers and such a waste of time. worse than these, it ends as like as Indian movies since 70s (Amitabh Bachan etc.)!!

234,xgingerx-169-876151,A Narrative Disaster.,4,26 June 2012,"For some peculiar reason I found myself really wanting to watch this film, and thanks to video store employment benefits, I got to watch it 6 days before It's release date. So as you can understand, I was looking forward to this. The inclusion of Tom Hardy intrigued me from the start, as I always thought he was better than this film, and what do you know, I was right. From the word go, the scripting was awful, and the jokes were forced and predictable, and all I could think of the entire time, was why did he agree to do this? I never thought much of Witherspoon, or Pine, so they didn't bother me, and in actual fact, Chris Pine generated quite a few laughs, which was more than I expected from him. However, without Tom Hardy, this film would cannonball. He was the savour, if ever there was one. He made you laugh, but also made you sad simultaneously, because you just wanted to pull him out of this terrible film, and while we're on that subject, kudos to the casting director.The lack of action, gadgets, humour and well thought out revenge plans are what frustrated me the most, as it's what I expected before I watched the film. None of the above featured in the film, aside from one or two moments from Hardy. The ending of the film when you found out FDR slept with Tucks wife, was just the most unnecessary thing I have ever seen in my whole life, and caused me to end the film in sadness. The film even failed to play the cliché song at the end that persuades the audience they had a good time, depressing me further.A complimentary 4/10.",This Means War
235,bbwubrant,Eh to no good.,1,16 June 2012,"Contains spoilers!A C movie (watchable once) if the bellow issues are not a deal breaker for you (it is for me).(Deal breaker summarized, I am not covering all the issues - already too much of a rant) Movie is horrible; I am writing this comment during the movie. If you have any respect for relationships this movie will crap on that (she is specifies she is looking for the one).The sick feeling of watching the double dating, ""I need to have sex with them to decide which one is ""the one"""", was mentally impassible to the point that I couldn't enjoy watching the rest of the movie once ""gotta catch em both, gotta try them at the same time"" began. Few example gripes (different points):When Lauren found out that Tuck and FDR knew each other she got indignant and said ""This is just a game?, I trusted you!"". Seriously, the one double dating two guys that she thought didn't know each other, and she gets mad? Tuck's ex-wife left him because he wasn't around as a travel agent, so couldn't spend time with the family. At the end of the movie she finds out about his real job and decides to get back together with him, his job has never changed (so the time spent has never changed).They end the movie with FDR telling Tuck that he had sex with his wife, before she was his wife. But, that Tuck never had sex with Lauren- upholding the gentlemen's final agreement. Moral to this story, choose the better looking liar who is less of a gentleman and can lay you first, your job title means more than actually who you are or how much time you have and your mistakes happen but everything will be okay if not better because of them.(1 rating is my opinion, but barring I had no issues with how they dealt with relationships and reasoning I may have had rated it a 5)",This Means War

I walked in thinking that maybe it would be a rom com featuring Reese Whitherspoon, but while there are some rom elements. I was pleasantly surprised with what I call the bromantic comedy, featuring the relationship between FDR and Tuck. My friend who watched the movie made a good point; he said as soon as he stopped trying to mentally define the movie as a rom com or a bromance, he started enjoying the movie a lot more.While the movie was predictable, unrealistic, and scattered with type-casted characters (note, Chelsea Handler as wine-swigging, semi-bitter housewife/sister), it was also light-hearted, funny, and full of random action scenes. The plot development is far-fetched, the character development even more so, but a fun way to spend a couple hours.As a date movie, it's near perfect. Almost no sap and tons of gadgets/action for the guys, and what (straight) girl would not want to be in the same situation as Reese, having two extremely hot men vying to comedic near-death for her love?",This Means War

There are some really funny moments and lots of brilliant action in it. If you love this type of film then you'll really, really enjoy it. There are a few reasons it didn't get full marks: unlike with James Bond the fight scenes aren't quite so clear, it's hard to focus on what's going on. Also, Reese Witherspoon plays the same girl that she plays in every rom-com she's ever been in, which is annoying, but to be honest she is about the fourth person you pay attention to after Hardy's, Pine's and Chelsea Handler's characters. The last reason it didn't get full marks is because the ending is obvious. It's not much of a problem though and I'm really glad I went to see it.",This Means War

A past-the-marriageable-age-woman is looking for a bf and do some behavior to irritate her ex-bf with the support from a potential candidate. 2 men fighting for a woman, using ""professional technique"" and sometimes trifling skills (which would bring a lot of fun).This is really a mixed movie, which not only has fun, romance, but also action :D.2 men in this movie are both great, they could be ""ideal man"" of any girl, so I think girl will like this movie ^^ (I do).A good point here, the ending could please audience.

I like the actors and the actress, but the trailer itself made me not interested at all, because two men share a woman, a woman cheats to have two men is just wrong. However, my friend convinced me to watch it since we had the advanced screening tickets. The movie itself was expected, bad storyline, I'm just not quite sure what the movie was about? the ending seems wrong, it passes out a not so good message, and I think film industry is potentially the biggest propaganda. It's just after watching the movie, I felt it was a valentine movie, but I also felt I learned nothing from the movie and I remember nothing interesting from the movie. Confusion: There was one scene where the actress changed into a purple dress when she slept over with a white top? how did that happen? (I could be wrong)Pros: There were some laughs and the action scenes were great, definitely sexy and if you enjoy looking at good looking people, this movie has it all.

Me, I was rooting for the bad guys to slowly dispose of them in a vat of acid after poking them full of holes, so the acid would hurt more. Aside from that, the characters act like love-struck teen-agers (sorry teen-agers), the action scenes are totally unbelievable (walking up, unguarded, to a trio of assassins guns a-blazing at you, with only a handgun), and oh, don't get me started. Pay attention to what the characters are actually doing, instead of just liking them because you're 'supposed' to, and you'll totally be turned off.

I haven't laughed so hard in a while. While Chris Pine as FDR was dashing, I found myself more drawn to Tom Hardy's Tuck. You just wanted him to get the girl in the end. I thought the bromance was a 10 as was the girlmance. Trish's lines about ""her Bob"" really hit home about what marriage is and isn't. Her line ""don't pick the better man, pick the man that makes you better"" was good. Trish came off crass at first, but then grew on me as she should true tenderness and carrying later in the movie.

248,alexandralanc,"Full Of Laughs, But Not Amazing",6,26 February 2012,"Overall, I liked this film -- it certainly wasn't epic, but it was good for a laugh, and though it's similar to some of the other films I have seen, it was also creative. Pros: A lot of the lines were funny, some of the situations were hilarious (my personal favorite: the paintball scene and Reese's character dancing in her apartment), and the acting was good, as well as the soundtrack. There was a good cast, and they played their roles effectively. There were a few heartwarming moments, and the action was well-timed, and kept the pace of the film rolling, as well as gave the viewer a break from the romance. The two men were also very different, which gave the dating scenes good variety.Cons: One of the character's (Reese Witherspoon's BFF in the movie) humor was a bit fowl at times (when I went to see it, I didn't realize it was rated R, which I generally don't watch, so explains), and most of the dates that the men took Reese's character on were extravagant, and didn't seem believable considering the amount of time/pay needed for them. The film was also hugely predictable, though the laughs kept me entertained enough to not mind the predictability as much. Probably my biggest con about the film was the way the main character dealt with the two men -- call me old-fashioned, but I didn't particularly like how she dated both of them at the same time, and acted like potentially hurting one of them was okay (though, the same can be said for the men, who made a bet when they found out they were into the same woman); she also used one of the men to show off to her Ex, which I found a bit low. Also, I didn't like the main character's solution to picking a man in the end: have sex with both, and see which was better at it-- again, maybe old-fashioned, but I thought the film would have done well without it.See this film if: You're not looking to walk out of it saying ""Wow, that was amazing!"", but ""Wow, that was funny!"" -- or if you're up for a good laugh.Sum Up: A good film with good acting, humor, and a hint of romance and laugh-inducing fight scenes. Fast-paced, but well balanced.My Rating: 6/10Alexandra Lanc~ Originally Posted On Blog: http://www.wordsoftheworlds.blogspot.com",This Means War

I... kinda liked the movie... it was kinda bad but I kinda liked it. Lets get a few things out the way. Editing was horrible, the entire opening looked like a trailer and the later scenes I was screaming ""CUT!"" at the movie. Acting is solid through out the movie although the movie really just centres around FDR and Laurens relationship because Tuck and her don't have any chemistry really. There are about... four fights, they use shaky cam and you cant tell what was happening, for some reason when FDR and Tuck fight its really short and Tuck takes most of the hits. There are a few good scenes in the movie but I didn't laugh that much apart from Tucks date scene that I found amusing as he guns down teenagers and man-handles others in a paint ball game.Really, the best parts were in the trailers and thats really it, if you want Chris Pine watch ""Star Trek"", if you want Tom Hardy watch ""Bronson"" or ""Warrior"", Reese Witherspoon... I haven't seen any good movies with her in...""This Means War"" could have been a good movie but its to much of a RomCom that has horrible editing and choppy fight scenes. The action scenes are few and far between and generally meh except the Paintball scene that is in all the trailers.",This Means War

I have always been a really big fan of Reese Witherspoon, and have always found that the movies that she chooses to do have turned out really well( except for Legally Blonde 2). But then the movie released and the critics reviews started pouring in. I wasn't too sure if I wanted to see the movie after seeing the low ratings on IMDb too.Then I finally got around to watching it last night. N i was completely blown away! Let me tell you, the movie is really funny. Its sweet, has a really interesting plot, and keeps you engaged right until the last scene. Its all that I had expected it would be when I had first seen the trailer. N then some.It in fact exceeded my expectations. I was still laughing long after the movie was over.N among the first thoughts in my head after the movie were, ""what on earth is wrong with the critics"" !!",This Means War

In this film his ""pop-imagery"" came once more to the limits, that directors of many of his kind - without a solid training in screen writing, and the feeling for a professional leading of actors - can not exceed (sorry Mc, you would never become a Guy Ritchie).To make matters worse, the two main characters were played by the two absolutely talent-free actors Chris Pine and Tom Hardy (teeny-target- -group-beauty does not always matter..) Against their stiff and stylized play, unfortunately neither Reese Witherspoon nor Till Schweiger could hold against. This would have required a better script than this weak version of one more Spy vs.Spy-theme. Conclusion: If I want see a CIA-version of ""Supernatural"" I would wait for the TV-Series.

I'd read the user reviews, but wanted to see more of Tom Hardy (loved his performance in Lawless). Beyond those accurate complaints, I have to add one more. Many of the scenes look and feel so fake! As though the actors stood on a sound stage and all this phony background activity were on a green screen behind them. Granted, a certain amount of this technique is necessary; I mean, nobody really believes Tom is hanging off the edge of a skyscraper, yet still manages to catch the suitcase with the device as it hurtles by. But even in low action scenes where a (stupid) conversation is taking place on a street or in a park? I realize that my objection is sort of like that Woody Allen joke in Annie Hall, where someone complains that the restaurant food is terrible, then adds, and ""such small portions too!"" This Means War is terrible, in just so many ways.",This Means War
259,dsuareztouzon,Two top CIA spies find their enduring friendship put to the ultimate test when they engage in an all-out war to win the affections of a beautiful woman .,7,1 October 2012,"Diego Suarez Touzon 9/16/12 Review of the movie This Means WarThis Means War is an amazing movie for everyone above 12 years old. The movie, a good comedy that was wonderfully filmed. Is the ideal way to spend a weekend night. Why should you use your money on this particular movie? Because it will make you laugh and you will spend a really good evening! It is one of those movies that you can absolutely not stop watching once you have started it. It has good rhythm and very funny parts, during which you sometimes really feel embarrassed for one of the main characters. The situations in which the characters happen to be are almost burlesque.The movie keeps you going because the producer plays around so smartly with the roles that the two good actors perform. Froster (Chris Pine), a top CIA agent, and Tuck (Tom Hardy), his best friend also a CIA agent show how much they respect their work and especially their friendship and how they would never let someone break that bond. They are colleagues and friends that rely on each other at both personal and professional levels. Tuck is separated from his wife and has a son, they both believe he is a travel agent. Froster is single and spends his time flirting and having affairs with random women.When Frost and Tuck find out they are dating the same woman, Lauren (Reese Witherspoon) their great relationship starts to change. Even if they say they will stop their relationship with Lauren if she gets in between them, these two CIA agents are not really able to follow through with their promise. They completely forget about their friendship and only start thinking about how to win over Lauren using all the tools that a CIA agent can have. Froster, for example uses a spy plane to track Tuck's movements when he is on a date with Lauren and on the other hand Tuck uses a sniper dart to put Froster to sleep when he thinks he and Lauren are getting very close.Another factor that makes This Means War a great movie is the fact that the ending is not quite the normal Hollywood ending ""And they lived happily ever after."" In fact it is quite the opposite as Tuck and Froster get in a fight at the end over a long held secret. The way this movie ends is very funny and makes you wonder if there will ever be a sequel. This augments the movie's originality making it even more special.When it came out in the cinema I was reluctant to go watch it because it seemed like it was going to be another pointless and boring romantic movie but to my surprise it turned out to be one of the most hilarious and original comedy I have ever seen. I highly recommend This Means War to anyone that would be ready to spend a fun evening. You can rent it on Netflix or just directly at a video shop. But you might as well buy it because you will certainly love it and enjoy seeing it more than once. I hope you will like it as much as I did. SEE IT NOW!",This Means War
260,fis-skater,Not a great movie. Very cliché. For people age 12-14.,3,28 October 2012,"Obviously this movie was going to be cliché since its a romantic/action/comedy. This movie is as stated about two CIA agents who are best friends in the beginning then both meet the same girl and fall for her and then their not friends anymore and a German gangster (Till Schweiger) comes to kill them and threatens the girl which causes the both to recommend. The themes and morals addressed are very simple - friendship is good don't forget about your friend.The movie has a lot of cut scenes and little dialog. This movie is probably something for children age 12-14 and viewers with less expectations or simply lower standards. For anyone with a refined taste of movies this is not the film to watch, but these people would probably be able to deduce this from a look at the name and genre.",This Means War
261,kewlcow334-530-362355,Terrible,1,15 November 2012,"I thought this was a terrible movie. The wrong guy definitely won (the jerk) AND I don't see why you have to have 10 lines minimum for a submission either. I'm pretty sure a one line comment is enough to accurately describe a stupid movie: ""This means war"" is a prime example of a stupid movie. The fact that they have to warn people about filling in their comments with fluff should tell you something... hasn't IMDb heard of the K.I.S.S principle. If not, they should do some research. The world is a much better place when people keep things simple. Here, if my one line HIGHLY ACCURATE review of the movie isn't enough, I'll add slightly more to fill in the RIDICULOUS ten lines minimum. Girl meets boy- boy is a gentleman. Girl meets another boy. This boy is a jerk. Both boys know each other, but girl doesn't know that. Girl finds out both boys know each other, and instead of doing the logical thing-walking away b/c BOTH are liars, and instead of picking the lesser of two evils (since the movie is based on having to chose), she chooses the jerk. Hopefully this is enough of a description of a movie that could be summed up in one word: TERRIBLE!",This Means War
262,Yanzig,"Why, Tom? WHY?!",1,11 December 2012,"This is a god awful concoction of s*** stew. Lauren (Witherspoon) is presented as a 30 something frumpy, self conscious idiot who's introduction is spent lying about her life to an ex she runs into and sighing over her loneliness. After her friend hooks her up with an online dating profile, she sees Tuck's (Hardy) picture, and decides she is going to give it a shot. She meets Tuck, they immediately engage in back and forth watered down humour and then suddenly, due to poor editing, the date ends without any sign of how long it was. She then goes to rent a DVD.. (who does that in 2012?) where she meets FDR (Pine), who tries to obnoxiously hit on her. In the span of a few hours, she is hit on by both Hardy and Pine, and develops wit and confidence, and actually shoots one of them down. This is coming from a chick who hasn't been able to talk to men in years. All it took was for her to experience a wardrobe change, and miraculously we never see awkward, frumpy Lauren again. Instead, enters the sexy irresistible Lauren we always knew was under that frump! The rest of the movie, we see Pine and Hardy competing for her affection and the ultimate answer: which man does she fall in love with?!There is an unlikely friendship between Pine and Hardy; federal agents who consider each other family, yet have no problem sabotaging one another for a girl. Neither of them have parents yet we are constantly reminded that this is more of an embarrassing problem for ""sensitive"" Hardy than Pine. Why? NO ONE KNOWS. There are a lot of plot holes and hints at what emotional direction the film wants you to take, but without resolution. When they first meet, Hardy's character relies more on his honesty and genuine kindness to win over Lauren, yet Pine basically tricks her into liking him after her rejection. The film, clearly steers us in the direction of favouring Tuck, yet Lauren chooses FDR in the end. WHY does Lauren pick the man who deceived his way into her heart, over the guy she was naturally falling for? WTF.Never mind this being an ""action"" movie, these men don't have time for action! They are too busy falling in love! Too busy calculating their next chess move against each other by spending their time spying on her. Any woman with an ounce of self respect would be completely mortified after finding out her home was invaded and tapped with surveillance. Yet, this wasn't even questioned. Like people have mentioned, the moral of the story is, the American ass-hole wins the girl, while the British gentlemen gets his own left overs, his ex wife.Through out the entire film, I felt embarrassed for Hardy. So much talent, charisma, sexiness... all gone to waste in this ridiculous film, although he actually pulled off what he could with a terribly written script and terrible co-stars. This type of movie, I would expect from Witherspoon and Pine, but Hardy... at the peak of his career? Why did he do this? Out of pity? I just don't understand. I am left with confusion and frustration. I will let this one pass Tom, but if you ever do this to me again... I just don't know if I could excuse it.",This Means War
263,tanajasa,Why the bashing?,6,26 December 2012,"Readind the reviews it seems like some people actually expected something great from this movie, something unique. Why? It's an action romcom. Nothing special, just the usual fairly entertaining good old American stuff, that you wouldn't watch twice. I personally kinda enjoyed it. The action part was quite sloppy (poor Til Schweiger with his cute German accent), but the romance part, the rivalry between Tom Hardy and Chris Pine was all right, spiced with some humor (well, OK, not much of that)- not to mention both men are pretty easy to look at. Yeah OK, I admit, if the main characters weren't this attractive, this movie would be... um... not so enjoyable. But still, the idea behind it was not bad - maybe it could have been directed, or written better, but it was good enough for a Valentine's day comedy. The ending was absolutely not surprising and very cliché, but I didn't expect it to be otherwise. So... What I'm trying to say in my not so flawless English, is that this movie was not worse than the average action romcom - I don't understand why are there so many hateful comments.",This Means War

They manage to make it seem real and deliver the comedy superbly. Reese Withersppon is great as usual, but sometimes she does seem a little awkward and it seems like she isn't really with the scene properly. The main two are funny and witty and really bring the story to life from the action to the romance. My only jab at it is that more action could have been put into it, it's supposed to be about spy's. It isn't cliché at all, in some parts its predictable but the story line means some parts are going to be, but mostly it left me guessing and the ending had me in stitches.

268,kylepaterson1,cynical accounting book.,3,18 January 2015,"The two times I laughed at this movie are overrided by just how cynical, incoherent and sloppy This Means War actually is. The script comes across like it was written by an 8 year old boy who is dying to prove to the world that he's more grown up and mature than he actually is. Along with McG's inability to direct action sequences with his fast paced yet sloppy camera-work, he also shows real skill in making high profile actors Tom Hardy, Chris Pine and Reese Witherspoon look like they don't give a s**t and are only there to pick up the check at the end of the shoot, topped by the annoying bitchy performance of Chelsea Handler. Probably all because the actors knew their characters were stupid and unlikeable (Tom Hardy's character the only slightly likable one). it gets to the point where you do wish that the bad guy in the film shows up sooner n stops these sleezy, creepy and cynical attempts of the guys to win the hand and heart of reese witherspoon.This Means War takes a potentially very good idea for a film and then sucks the life out of it by turning it into a cynical, lazy, money milking accounting book of trash.",This Means War
