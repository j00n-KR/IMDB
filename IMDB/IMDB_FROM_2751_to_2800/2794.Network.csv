0,MartinHafer,Exceptional but certainly NOT a picture you should let your kids see,9,16 February 2007,"This is one of the most cynical films of all time, with a very dark and sometimes humorous look at the banality of television and the stupidity of the public. At the same time, since it's so cynical and dark, it features some exceptionally adult dialog that even today should exclude kids from watching it. Now I do understand why such rough language was used (after all, this is a harsh ""wrinkles and all"" look at television), but it's a shame really as the film COULD be an excellent civics lesson to our kids--especially teens. Watching the contempt that network programmers have for intelligence and decency is an important lesson and makes this an exceptional film.Just how far a network will go for ratings is the major thrust of the film? The evening news anchorman of UBS News (a great acronym) is losing his mind. However, when he actually has a nervous breakdown and announces he's going to kill himself on the air, even the soul-less people at the network are even initially upset--that is until the ratings come in for this an the following broadcast when the same announcer uses tons of profanity. Then, instead of disavowing themselves from it, they bathe in the horrible spectacle of a person losing his hold on reality! And, in turn, this sort of crap programming results in even more controversial and pointless shows--such as one that glorifies terrorists and encourages these killers to film their exploits so they can be shown on TV! The sickest and funniest aspect of this was the business meeting the network bigwigs had with the terrorists when it was becoming obvious that these Communist Radicals were actually becoming astute Capitalists and were concerned with profits and residuals!! There's a lot more to the film than this. In particular, there is a relationship between William Holden and Faye Dunaway that is actually intended as a representation of the shallowness of the media. In other words, Holden is seduced by Miss Dunaway--just like the public is often seduced by glitz without substance or depth. This parallel story is exceptional and Dunaway received an Oscar for her wonderful part. Oddly, while Holden was also exceptional in the film, the Oscar for Best Actor was given to Peter Finch (the insane anchor man) even though he is really more of a supporting character. Both he and Holden were up for the award. Beatrice Straight received the Best Supporting Actress for her very brief appearance in the film. While she WAS excellent, she was only on screen a tiny fraction of the film. So, choosing her and Finch as Oscar recipients both seem like odd choices in hindsight. Paddy Cheyevsky, not surprisingly, also garnered an Oscar for his insightful script.All in all, while not one of the very greatest films I have seen, it certainly is a must-see for film fans and a wonderful example of cynicism and dark humor.",Network
1,TheLittleSongbird,Superb film with one of the finest screenplays ever written,10,30 December 2010,"Network is simply brilliant in every aspect. There is nothing actually here that I can fault. It is a compelling, brilliantly written, beautifully acted movie and more.The film does look great. The cinematography is excellent, while the scenery, locations and costumes are top notch. Sidney Lumet, a solid director a vast majority of the time does a exemplary job directing too, in fact Network is probably his best-directed film.Then there is the screenplay. I still stand by my thoughts that Network has one of the best screenplays ever, scathing yet daring and sophisticated and intelligent. And it is flawlessly delivered by William Holden, Peter Finch, Robert Duvall and Faye Dunnaway who in turn give wonderful performances and a stellar support cast.All in all, it is a superb film, and I'd say it is one of the best of the 70s. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Network
2,bkoganbing,The mad prophet of the air,9,3 March 2006,"In the world that author Paddy Chayefsky created for Network, there are in fact four television networks instead of the three that people from my generation grew up with. That fourth TV network is the United Broadcasting Systems or UBS for short. They are running a very poor fourth, especially in the news division. Their Walter Cronkite is one Howard Beale who's been slipping badly in the ratings. Beale played by Peter Finch is given the axe by his good friend, the director of the news division of UBS Max Schumacher who is played by William Holden.Beale who really has nothing else in his life, left a childless widower a few years earlier, but this program. He calmly announces that he's going to kill himself on the next broadcast.That sets in motion a chain of events in the network and in the company that owns the network and the holding company that owns the company that make Howard Beale the mad prophet of the air. Programmer Faye Dunaway decides to blend news and entertainment with a series of startling ideas. What hath Network wrought? In 1976 Network was considered clever way out satire. Now there's more truth in it than one would like to believe. Now we have television networks that are devoted to nothing but news, but strive for those all important ratings with blending entertainment with news.But Chayefsky missed the boat in two respects. He did not anticipate the rise of cable television. Whereas my generation grew up with three networks period, affordable cable has multiplied the networks into the hundreds. That in itself makes the four network reality of Network outdated. And of course Mr. Chayefsky did as so many others, not anticipate the Internet where so many people now get their information and it's even a source of entertainment. Bill Holden and Peter Finch were nominated for their performances in the Best Actor category. They probably would have split the vote which is what normally happens, but for Peter Finch's demise before the Oscar voting. Sad to say that probably clinched the Oscar for him, but it was still well deserved. An honest decent man who gets caught up in machinations that end in tragedy, you don't take your eyes off Finch for one second while he's on screen.Holden is caught up in the machinations as well. He gets a midlife crisis and starts an affair with Faye Dunaway, but their differences in not only age, but general outlook on life drive them apart. Holden's left his wife Beatrice Straight for Dunaway and she got a Best Supporting Actress award for her scenes telling off Mr. Holden. It's by no means certain what Holden's future is, but it is clear he has no place in the television industry as it was constituted in 1996.Nor I doubt he would have one today in 2006. I can see Holden's character, a man now in his mid 80s being a professor emeritus of journalism at some college or even running a newsblog today. Robert Duvall, Wesley Addy, William Prince are all corporate types we find in various films about big business. The one character who stands out for me is Ned Beatty, the head of the conglomerate who bought the whole network. His scene with Peter Finch where he explains the facts of life to the now demented Howard Beale is the best in the film.Network is a great film, both entertaining and thought provoking.",Network
3,Leofwine_draca,Arch satire,6,8 October 2018,"NETWORK is one of those well-remembered '70s movies that takes a sharp swipe at the media and the exploitation of pretty much anything in a bid for ratings. It's well worth watching to see Peter Finch deliver a bombastic turn at the very end of his career, and his famous rants and speeches are undoubtedly the best thing here. Elsewhere, we get to see Faye Dunaway at her most venal, and William Holden as the stressed-out guy trying to hold everything together. I did find the execution a little bit heavy handed, some of the targets obvious, but that's because the world has moved on and become much more polarised in the 40-something years since this was released. The recent NIGHTCRAWLER is a darker version of the story, and even better in my mind.",Network
4,SnoopyStyle,Insightful but second half weirdly uncomfortable,7,20 September 2014,"Howard Beale (Peter Finch) is an aging declining UBS news anchor. Longtime friend/boss Max Schumacher (William Holden) tells him that he's going to be replaced. Beale goes on the air to announce that he will commit suicide on the next Tuesday broadcast. Meanwhile programmer Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway) develops a reality show with Ecumenical Liberation Army terrorists who film their own bank robbery. Executive Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall) has the news division on the chopping block. Schumacher allows Beale to go on one more time to say goodbye, but he goes on a tirade which cause the ratings to spike. Beale catches the eye of Diana Christensen and she convinces Hackett to keep him on the air. Diana starts to have an affair with Schumacher.It's a funny satire at the time. It's more of a funny but sad reality of TV nowadays. What is over the top satire from the mind of writer Paddy Chayefsky is now too close to the truth. The fact that it's so real diminishes the comedy. It's a little sad that the stupidity has become common place. Director Sidney Lumet does this comedy straight and allows the material to shine on its own. I also find the second half too convoluted and too unreal. All the Howard Beale Show stuff is too weird with a very uncomfortable ending. I just can't see why people would watch his show. And ending the movie that way is really unfunny.",Network
5,Hitchcoc,It's What Television Has Become,9,6 April 2006,"Imagine a world where the news is controlled by conglomerates, where bad taste is the norm, where we no longer want journalists but entertainers, where we will exploit anyone for ratings. Oh, wait, that's what happened. This movie was an omen. Watch it today and you will see that what seemed shocking and incredible, is much like many of our news networks today. We have right and left slinging mud. We have reality shows that make the news, full of disgusting interactions among people. The Jerry Springer influence is all over the place. We even have shows to create our next entertainers. Don't be surprised if in the near future we televise executions. ""Network"" saw the handwriting on the wall and simply put it out there. Like Capra's ""Meet John Doe,"" this is the blood lust of the populace laid bare. It's a reflection of a nation that is so full of itself that it has become bored with the mundane and the pleasurable. This movie capitalizes on those feelings. Now we find out that huge corporations are buying up newspapers and television stations and have the blessing of the power structure in Washington. Can you say ""1984."" I used to think that this was conspiracy theory. Let's hope that what Faye Dunnaway is planning in this film doesn't come totally true because when news is manipulated, we lose our last bit of control of the decision makers.",Network
6,Prismark10,Network,8,1 July 2019,"Network was likely to have been conceived by writer Paddy Chayefsky as a cynically satirical film about corporate television companies. They so long had to carry the news departments as a loss leader.In Network the corporation could imagine a world where news makes money. It does not have to be reporting events, facts or the truth. You just need a demagogue to tell you to be angry.Network ended up being prophetic. Nowadays you get rich white people on the internet, cable news and shock radio giving you all the reasons to be angry about and they get even richer. Heck they send the maid out to get their illegal drugs because they cannot be bothered!Howard Beale (Peter Finch) is not angry. He is mad because he is having a breakdown. A news anchor facing declining ratings and a personal life that led him to the booze bottle.Beale is told by his long-term friend and news boss, Max Schumacher (William Holden) that it is over. The
network are firing him. Beale response is to tell the live television audience that he plans to kill himself live on television.In a later appearance he has a rant which causes ratings to shoot up. Programming boss Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway) sees potential to do a new type of television show with Beale. She even signs up a domestic terrorist organisation to front their own show such as filming their own
illegal activities.Corporate Executive Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall) is all for it if the news division makes money. Hackett is the ultimate bean counter.Network was an adult movie when it was released with frank language. People are used and discarded. Beale is only of use if he brings in the ratings.Eventually his rants will affect the corporate bottom line or his ratings will decline.Christensen has an affair with the veteran Schumacher because he is a powerful old man with knowledge of the world and the news division. To Schumacher she is a beautiful young woman, a last chance to fall in love again and have fun.Over 40 years later, Network still delivers because its message is relevant. It is also so well acted. British actor Peter Finch did not live to collect his best actor Oscar. He won it posthumously. Ned Beatty almost matched him in his short cameo appearance.",Network
7,mark.waltz,"The ""1984"" of the 1970's.",10,18 December 2018,"Back in the mid 1970's, cable TV was a luxury. There were three networks, two forms of channels to surf (UHF and VHF), and the national news was either in print format or available through only ABC, CBS or NBC. Women anchors were few, let alone executives, so Faye Dunaway's character here (Diana Christensen) is far ahead of her time, and admittedly ""one of the boys"". Peter Finch's fictional network national news anchorman Howard Beale has been through the ringer and has been given his notice, and like ""Meet John Doe's"" Long John Willoughby, plans to kill himself. Unlike Willoughby, however, his suicide is planned to be real from his own lips, where Gary Cooper's ""Meet John Doe"" character only planned to disappear after the circulation scheme created by columnist Barbara Stanwyck passed its target date. It's the people behind the scenes in ""Network"" who pull the strings here, and instead of just newspaper owner Edward Arnold in that Frank Capra classic, you've got bigwigs from around the world it seems playing puppet master with Finch's life. Sidney Lumet, one of the great directors of the modern era of cinema, leads the way for what is considered one of the all time classics of the past 40 years.With one of the greatest ensembles ever assembled for a big budget cinematic release, ""Network"" grabs you from the moment of Lee Richardson's voice popping up to narrate Beale's story. Gradually, you get to meet the important people involved behind the scenes which includes Vice President of programming Dunaway, Finch's old pal, executive William Holden, and Robert Duvall as the head of a conglomorate who has bought up the network for its own selfish purposes. Others behind the scenes in smaller but equally important parts include veteran actors William Prince, Wesley Addy, Jordan Charney and Ned Beatty, each add to the bubbling volcano boiling within the network, not only focusing on the news program, but potential series Dunaway considers to help build up ratings which seem to be at an all time low, having it at the bottom of the four.TV series of the time from other networks are mentioned as ratings giants dominating the airwaves, and political events and tensions are added in fictional subplots to create even more tension. Marlene Warfield and Arthur Burghardt get an interesting subplot as members of a black extremist group whose cause becomes Dunaway's prize ratings cash cow, even though you can tell that she really could care less about any cause except pushing her own career up the ladder. Dunaway's affair with Holden causes a split between him and his long devoted wife (Oscar winner Beatrice Straight in probably the greatest cameo in motion picture history) and leads Holden to see what is behind the dwindling soul of the very troubled Dunaway. As she reveals the history of her failed love life (a husband who ran off with another man and her inadequacies in bed), you see someone with one direction in life that is easy to see ending with either suicide or a mental hospital. Twists involving her at the end might even have you drop your jaw in shock. By this point, there's no turning back for her, and it really makes you feel sorry for her as well as her victims.While the temptation is there to compare her performance to her notorious role of Joan Crawford in ""Mommie Dearest"", the subtle nuances Dunaway utilizes here makes her fascinating to watch. Diane Christensen has been compared to several powerful women in business who had reputations for being horrible to work for, the character of Diane is written as more commanding than demanding, somebody you might respect at first glance for her intelligence and beauty, but once subtleties make her real character known, she becomes closer to Sigourney Weaver's comical executive in ""Working Girl"" rather than Meryl Streep's nasty Miranda Priestly in ""The Devil Wears Prada"". The scenes between Holden and Dunaway exploring the nuances of their relationship show a very damaged woman, a fascinating view into the future of people obsessed with social media and unable to see reality past the push of their finger from their electronic devices.Then, there's the powerful cameo of Ned Beatty as one of the heads of the social destructive conglomerate, tearing Finch down for taking things too far in his sudden fame after his ""I'm as mad as hell!"" declaration and basically threatening to destroy the agendas Beatty, Duvall and others have set up in their attempts to manipulate and control society. Like Ms. Straight, Beatty takes over the film for one five minute scene and becomes unforgettable. It is with his appearance that this film delves into the darkness of the future from 1976 which now seems to be our present. A well received Broadway version of ""Network"" has opened to raves and sold-out performances, and dismisses any notion film historians have made in discussing the relevance of ""Network"" in movie history. There was much tension at the 1977 Academy Awards because of the powerful competition ""Network"" faced (two films, ""All the President's Men"" and ""Taxi Driver"", also show dark glimpses into American society; the winner, ""Rocky"", was a crowd pleaser that stood the test of time), but winning three out of the four acting awards as well as screenplay, ""Network"" is a modern classic that film students will be discussing for years.",Network
8,kosmasp,Satire or truth?,9,24 May 2020,"Watching this I was think ""what a great satire"" and it still holds up after all those years. The filmmaker on the other hand was like: we didn't see this as satire, but as something actually happening. Well I don't think one excludes the other, but maybe you have different views on this.Whatever the case, this is as close to the real things than one can get without this being a documentary. So many things that you see here, have happened on TV (mostly to fish people, to get viewers to watch) ... because even bad news is good news. Or something along those lines. Many shocking things happen, none as shocking as that ending. Which thankfully has not happened yet in real life ... and it does not need to. Great acting, great story and almost a must see for anyone who likes dramas/thrillers surrounding media and what we get served. Not to mention the delve into society and human nature ...",Network
9,classicsoncall,"""Television is not the truth"".",9,14 April 2011,"I can't tell you how long it's been since I stopped watching network TV. This film illustrates the main reason why - it plays to the lowest common denominator and masquerades the pretense of real life into manageable bite size segments. As the Mad Prophet of the Airways, Howard Beale (Peter Finch) was indeed a unique harbinger of things to come - people have since committed suicide on television and it's oh so passe for your average dysfunctional family to erupt into fist fights on Jerry Springer. The brilliance of ""Network"" is that the film and it's writer Paddy Chayefsky saw it all barreling down the pike over three decades ago. So now we have a surfeit of reality shows, and the heck of it is, is that nothing is real about it. Contestants and outcomes are pre-determined for their ratings potential, while viewers wait breathlessly for the next installment of Idol.The real future shock of ""Network"" is embodied by the character of Arthur Jensen (Ned Beatty), president of CCA - Communication Corporation of America. When Jensen dresses down Beale with his tirade for blowing the deal with Western World Funding, he reveals the real power manipulating the world economy. ""There is only one holistic system of systems"", and that's money, big money, breaking down the barriers between nations and shifting focus onto a single global economy. You didn't hear much about that concept thirty five years ago, but the idea keeps rearing it's ugly head more and more as time goes by.A dozen years after ""Network"", another film came out that envisioned a future in which the masses needed distraction from high unemployment and a lowered standard of living. In ""The Running Man"", the world economy had collapsed, dissent in this country wasn't tolerated by the government, and television programming came under the supervision of the Justice Department. High stakes reality TV programming where death was a real consequence for participants was the principal viewing fare for an overcrowded population. I'd like to believe human beings are better than that, but every time I get my hopes up, someone like Charlie Sheen comes just around the corner blasting away his torpedoes of truth.",Network
10,gavin6942,"A Nice Rambling, But Coherent, Rant on the Corporate Media",9,8 March 2010,"Howard Beale (Peter Finch), longtime anchor of the UBS Evening News, learns he has just two more weeks on the air because of declining ratings. The following night, he announces on live television that he will commit suicide by shooting himself in the head during next Tuesday's broadcast. Beale promises he will apologize for his outburst. However, once on the air, he launches into a rant claiming that life is bull.From the director of ""12 Angry Men"", ""Serpico"" and ""Dog Day Afternoon""... so you pretty know you're getting quality. And, dare I say it, of those films listed, this is his best of all.I loved the Ecumenical Liberation Army, a very clear parody of the Symbionese Liberation Army, who were also mentioned. A news network working hand-in-hand with a terrorist group in order to boost its ratings? Priceless.But the key speech of the film comes from Arthur Jensen, the prophet of corporate cosmology (Ned Beatty): ""There is only one holistic system of systems, one vast and immane, interwoven, interacting, multivariate, multinational dominion of dollars... It is the international system of currency which determines the totality of life on this planet. That is the natural order of things today... There is only IBM, and ITT, and AT&T, and DuPont, Dow, Union Carbide, and Exxon. Those are the nations of the world today."" This speech (and it is much longer on film) really sums up the news business, even more today than the 35 years ago in which is was spoken.) Oh, and look for the important cameo by a very young Tim Robbins. That pretty much seals the deal for this being one of the all-time most butt-kicking films ever made. A must-see for every man, woman and child.",Network
11,lee_eisenberg,"Ladies and gentlemen, we present to you: entertainment at any cost!",10,2 December 2005,"When ""Network"" first came out, it probably seemed like a warning of what could happen. Now, in the age of infotainment-mergers-etc, it's amazing how accurate they were. Actually, ""Network"" isn't really about mergers as much as TV stations getting taken over by organizations that have nothing to do with news (sound familiar, people?). When anchorman Howard Beale's (Peter Finch in an posthumous Oscar-winning role) ratings drop, the network fires him, and he flips on air. So, the network decides to exploit this. And exploit it they do. Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway in an Oscar-winning role) is the epitome of the bitchy, business-obsessed executive woman; she talks about business even when having sex. All in all, it's impressive how real this movie looks today.",Network
12,jboothmillard,Network,8,9 March 2012,"From Oscar BAFTA nominated director Sidney Lumet (12 Angry Men, Murder on the Orient Express, Dog Day Afternoon), I had heard a lot about this satirical film, and I was very keen to watch it, so I didn't miss it when the opportunity arose. Basically the UBS (Union Broadcasting System) television network have suffered being in fourth place in the ratings average for some time, behind the three other competitors, ABC (American Broadcasting Company), NBC (National Broadcasting Company) and CBS (Columbia Broadcasting System). Once popular news anchor Howard Beale (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Peter Finch) of the network has had his personal problems coming into work, such as his alcoholism, and it has resulted in the dwindling ratings, and effective in two weeks he has been fired. This news is given to him by his own long time friend and fellow network worker Max Schumacher (Oscar and BAFTA nominated William Holden), and following this he announces on live news that he will kill himself by blowing his brains out in a week's time, with reasons why. Pulled off Howard says he was drunk at the time and didn't know what he was thinking, doing or saying, and he pleads that the network should let him have a final newscast to put things right and leave with dignity. Instead he turns again and opens up with swearing and anger about his feelings of being fired and his opinions of the network and the workings of television in general, and this only works to pull in more viewers and ratings to UBS. Relatively new and ambitious network vice-president in charge of programming Diana Christensen (Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Faye Dunaway) takes notice of the boost in ratings, and she sees Howard as some kind of preacher to the people, telling them how they are feeling. She is keen to exploit this phenomenon he has created and create counter-establishment programming, so with Max's blessing a new format programme is made to invade the news casting, with Howard as the star, giving him the freedom to swear and rant about television and the network as much as he wants. Diana is keen to use her newfound power of programming to change formats of other shows on the network, while Max wants to preserve his reputation, and both have to deal with Howard, Max cares for his well being, while Diana only cares about getting high ratings from his aggressive behaviour on live television. They do have their differences, but surprisingly Diana and Max also start an affair together, but this plays on his mind as he does cares for his wife Louise (Oscar winning Beatrice Straight, who only appears for five minutes) who has been with for twenty five years. Howard gets at one point to meet the head of the CCA (Communications Corporation of America) who own the UBS network, chairman Arthur Jensen (Oscar nominated Ned Beatty) who sees Beale as not just a preacher for the realities of TV, but for God, and he suggests he should bring his faith into his preaching. This change, with him talking about God and the dehumanisation of society is depressing and boring, and it does not do any favours for the network, as they see the ratings figures slip, but Jensen is not allowing them to fire the host. To get rid of Howard and make the ultimate boost for the ratings for the network and an opening episode in a second season of the show, Diana, her boss Frank Hackett (BAFTA nominated Robert Duvall) and other executives agree to bring in the Ecumenical Liberation Army to assassinate him. The end of the film sees Howard Beale shot to death on live television, his show cancelled and replaced The Mao-Tse Tung Hour, and the narration declaring Howard the first (and obviously only) man to be killed because of lousy ratings. Also starring Wesley Addy as Nelson Chaney, Arthur Burghardt as Great Ahmed Kahn, Bill Burrows as TV Director, John Carpenter (not the director of Halloween) as George Bosch, Ken Kercheval as Merrill Grant, Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman's Lane Smith as Robert McDonough and Lance Henriksen as Network Lawyer at Khan's Place. Finch became the first actor to win a posthumous Oscar, as he died before the awards were nominated, and he does indeed give a great performance as the man breaking down and telling the harsh truth on live television, Dunaway is equally fantastic as the network executive who is willing to do anything to get thousands of people watching the network, and she doesn't care about anything else, Straight does give a good performance as an executive's wife who suffers the revelation of an affair, but she is a strange choice as a winner with a short time on screen (she was against Jodie Foster in Taxi Driver), Holden is also terrific as the friend of the mad news anchor trying to find his place in the network, and Duvall is good in his time on screen time as well. It is a fantastic satirical insight into the goings on of a television company, and the ideas that and concepts they come up with to make people watch their programming, with deliberate exploitation, and giving it a dark and eerie twist, and with a witty and clever script to go with it this is a highly watchable drama. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing and Best Picture, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Film, Best Editing, Best Screenplay and Best Sound Track, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Drama.

14,ma-cortes,An extreme critique to TV networks with great cast giving tour-de-force interpretations,7,5 November 2019,"A scathing indictment of the TV industry and its propensily towards ambition, corruption and self-prostitution. A washed-up TV presenter, Peter Finch, is gleefully exploited by his management staff , as he suffers paranoia and at the edge of a mental breakdown turns into a celebrity when he acts with his epileptic evangelic revivalism . As the network chiefs attempt to profit from his illness, as his announce to commit suicide himself boosts the ratings to such an extent that he finds his salary doubled.Black satire taking a savage, cruel bite at the American television , its anchormen, and the shares that rule the executives who work in it. Thought-provoking and ironical script from the prestigious Paddy Chayefsky. The individual roles are startling well drawn and the interpretation is magnificent. Peter Finch won an Academy award in his last film, he is excellent as a neurotic and ranting Television newcaster who flips his lid and he is prophesying gloom and doom and then he announces he is going to commit suicide on the air. While William Holden displays a sober acting as the faded executive in distress who falls for the younger Dunaway . As Faye Dunaway plays an ambitious executive who will stop at nothing to triumph, she gives overacting, an strident interpretation that threatens to overbalance the movie. And Holden's neglected wife is magnificently played by Beatrice Stright in a brief acting, considered to be the shortest performance to win an Oscar as support cast .Remaining secondary cast is very good such as Ned Beatty, Lance Henriksen, Wesley Addy, and special mention for Robert Duvall, and as narrator : Lee Richardson.It contains an adequate cinematography by Owen Roizman and atmospheric musical score by Elliot Lawrence. The motion picture was magnetically directed by Sidney Lumet, providing a lavishly mounted vehicle for three great actors, Peter Finch, Faye Dunaway and William Holden. Giving powerful scenes especially at the John Finch's appearances and when people come to the windows of their block of flats in a thunderstorm, and while displaying shouts .Lumet was one of the best American filmmakers, including important films such as 12 angry men, Fail safe, The pawnbroker, The hill, The deadly affair, The group, The offence, Serpico , Equus, The wiz, Prince of the city , Deathtrap , Daniel, Power, The morning after, Family business, Night falls on Manhattan, Gloria, Before the devil knows you are dead, among others.

I'm amused at the comments from students who viewed this film in class, writing, ""It was a good movie for its time."" A good movie is great for any time, and ""Network"" is a great movie. Posthumous Best Actor Oscar winner Peter Finch gives a harrowing performance as a TV news-anchor whose slipping sanity is used and abused by the network big-wigs; Best Actress winner Faye Dunaway is the sharp, soulless producer drowning deliriously in her work (she wants a separate life away from her job, but doesn't want to make compromises or pay any prices); Beatrice Straight won the Supporting Actress Oscar for small but solid role as William Holden's neglected wife; however, it is William Holden's work as an executive from the news division who holds the picture together, bringing it a current of sanity and logic. Holden struggles, he tries to do the right thing, he grits his teeth and covers his eyes at what he sees. Holden is positively amazing. It may be the finest performance of his long, esteemed career.

It's as fresh now - probably fresher - than it was in 1976, when it was probably a tad ahead of its time. It's a behind the scenes look at a failing network (like any of our big three) which has been absorbed by a non-entertainment conglomerate. Everything is about ratings, share, advertising, and everyone is a commodity.The story concerns two old-timers, William Holden and Peter Finch, who have become dinosaurs in their chosen field, network news, with Finch as Howard Beale, in front of the camera, and Holden as Max Schumacher, a producer. Beale is obviously having some kind of psychotic break, because when he announces his retirement on TV, he says he's tired of the bull... etc. and is going to kill himself on the show the following week.A top executive at the network, Diane Christensen (Faye Dunaway) notices a spike in the flagging ratings and wants Beale kept on the air. He becomes a media sensation - they're talking a 60 share, nowadays we talk 5. But then Howard tries to wreck an important merger deal with the Saudis, and the head of the conglomerate (Ned Beatty) steps in. Howard becomes a downer. The ratings slide. Something has to be done about Howard.Absolutely fantastic, with a brilliant performance by Peter Finch,the ""I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore"" guy, and a marvelous one by Faye Dunaway, a superstar at that time and astonishingly beautiful. They both won Oscars, Finch posthumously. They deserved them. Holden is appropriately worn out, which he was, as a man having a post-middle aged crisis, in love with the obsessive, ambitious Diane, for whom he leaves his wife (Beatrice Straight, who also won an Oscar).Everyone is excellent, and the film doesn't have a dull moment, but the most satirical scenes have to do with an American liberation army, on the style of the group that kidnapped Patty Hearst, on whom Diane wants to base a show. Today it would be a reality show, but Diane only wants to start the show will real footage of them kidnapping, blowing up buildings, and robbing banks. These underground terrorists become total experts on distribution costs, syndication, and the like - hilarious.A true classic.",Network
17,Quinoa1984,"Not just the sharp-as-a-tack dialog, but the key performances and the look of the film are enduring",10,29 May 2006,"This is one of those works that is emblematic of what can be done with a director who knows his craft and chooses a style that is both controlled and not controlling, a writer who can let out some wild scenes and incredible exposition and make it practically believable (maybe more so today), and a cast that understand their creative forces at work. After seeing the film I was actually struck just as much, for example, by William Holden's performance as I was by Peter Finch, though the latter usually gets most of the credit (and rightfully so, in an Oscar-winning turn beating out De Niro in Taxi Driver if one can believe that). But then one has to take into account their different levels of skill in their performances, and how they both deliver even more than what is required. Holden, for me, is just as good here as he is in his best work (Sunset Blvd, The Wild Bunch), but in the role of the worn-out, dedicated professional who in his own way has had about as enough bs that can be taken as the main character. Yet Holden also knows his performance needs to be more reserved, and as his story gets more complicated he has to make some subtle choices as perhaps the only really sane person in the film. His work here is accomplished in the style of one sense, while Finch, who plays a character going back and forth between being totally nuts and knowing more than anyone else out there in TV land, takes his role with a heedless abandon.In short, this is one of the more fearless looks at the media ever presented on film, and it's even more relevant today perhaps than when it was first released. It's sad that not only did Lumet and Paddy Chayevsky think that what they were doing (aside from the ending) was all true, but that as the decades have passed since Regan's to-do with changing the rules of journalism, it's gotten worse. It was actually kind of shocking to see one or two of the revelations from Finch in some scenes, and the connection made in the 3rd act with Saudi Arabia is one of my favorite parts of the film (particularly the speech by Ned Beatty in one of the all-time great one-scene roles). News, basically, now is like everything else on TV, where you get what you pay for via the advertising, but not as it should really be with the news as it is. Howard Beale, basically, is like one of those ultra-symbollic (but relatable) characters in movies, in a demented way like Stewart in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, where the truth has to be spoken by someone, but who in America will listen (or, ironically, who won't if it's shelled out right in front of the cameras).In other words, this is one of those films that does ask a viewer to think about what is being shown- an 'informed' public (which is growing less and less as the media becomes smaller and more controlled via government and regulations)- while still providing acting that sticks and lines of dialog that are among the best in 70's films. Faye Dunaway is the female counterpart to her older male stars and is just as good, being like a very cold, typical businesswoman who only makes things feel like she does, as if something was lost in youth. Duvall is also good here, if maybe not at his very best, in a role as a TV exec. But there are bit parts that are really good too, like the black female militant member who complains at a meeting about the grosses of showing footage on TV. And in a small way, like the films of Brooks and Monty Python, Lumet understands how to film things very realistically (though the style appropriately changed from start to finish) so that the satire within can spring out. Even an over-the-top scene like Beale's first Mad-as-Hell speech works on this level.Overall, this is a really amazing film, with enoughs scathing, dark material mixed with the truth that should and isn't presented to those who rely solely on programming. ""Because you're on television, dummy"" are the last words Beatty says to Beale in their scene after Beale asks ""why me?"" By the end, as the film reaches its ultimate climax, one might wonder if his question is relatable to all TV, not just the news. Why is it what you say to people through this abstract medium important, or not? The answers, looking at how the news is run now, should be obvious. Maybe Lumet's best outside of his more 'urban' films (i.e. Serpico, The Pawnbroker, Dog Day Afternoon).",Network

Marvelously played by Peter Finch, Beale etched an unforgettable movie character.It was certainly a sad scene when Finch was posthumously awarded the best actor Oscar for his portrayal of a very frustrated anchorman.As a news honcho hot-shot lady, Faye Dunaway merited an Oscar for best actress.As a network executive, William Holden had to settle for a best actor nomination. Yet, his movie wife, Beatrice Straight, was the surprise winner of the best supporting actress award. Remember her outburst when he told her that he was leaving her? You'd have to remember because that was one of her two scenes in this film, but she made the most out of it.""Network"" is one of the few movies where 5 acting Oscar nominations occurred. As mentioned before, we had Finch, Holden, Dunaway and Straight nominated. Ned Beatty would join them with a supporting nomination.Great film for the news hounds. Yet, is this what we're coming to when we have to resort to murder to get someone off the air? Obviously, this is far-fetched. This film came at the right time for both Peter Finch and William Holden, both of whom were at the twilight of their respective careers. We're dealing with a society where the individualization of man has totally been forgotten. Dunaway's character is totally memorable. She is incapable of any relationship and to say that she is committed to work is to put it mildly. In her devious ways, she will destroy anything that circles around her orbit. Ned Beatty looks like he could have been a character right out of ""Citizen Kane."" How come he merited a supporting nomination and Robert Duvall didn't?

19,wes-connors,Paddy Chayefsky Gets Mad at the Media,10,17 January 2011,"With his ratings in the toilet, and cancellation looming, veteran newscaster Peter Finch (as Howard Beale) decides to go out with a ""BANG!"" and announces he will commit suicide on his last broadcast. Boozy ""UBS"" network news chief William Holden (as Max Schumacher) decides to let his drinking buddy go before the camera one last time to apologize, and bow out with some dignity. Instead, Mr. Finch goes on another tirade. Of course, the ratings skyrocket, and Finch becomes a TV demagogue. Next, his popular news show is given to entertainment division executive Faye Dunaway (as Diana Christensen), who uses it to build a sensationalistic and successful schedule for the ""Network"". With uncanny direction from Sidney Lumet, ""Network"" is a bottomless pit of great performances, with Holden and Finch demonstrating the best use of vulgar language in at least a decade.Writer Paddy Chayefsky's award-winning warning was taken for satire in 1976, and is now considered a blueprint for success. Everything in this film was happening then, and continues on a larger scale. Mr. Chayefsky was a television original, and had a front row seat when he witnessed television's ""vast wasteland"" grow to unmanageable proportions. Perversely, the real networks responded to this film by turning their news coverage over to entertainment divisions (one rather blatantly, and famously). The end of the Fairness Doctrine helped insure a future of garbage, with no end in sight. Presently, we have 24-hour news channels delivering less information than was once available in less than 30 minutes.

20,Coventry,The yelling movie,8,3 August 2021,"Around the year 2000, or so, I joined a weekly film-debating group. I only went to two or three session, though, since the majority of participants were unbelievable snobs that looked down upon film if they weren't artsy enough. You know the type; if it's not three-and-a-half hours long or directed by either Fellini or Bergman, it's a lousy movie. What I do remember quite vividly is a discussion about ""Network"", which I hadn't yet seen back then, and never saw until now, another twenty years later. ""Network"" was unanimously referred to as ""the yelling movie"", and that is actually quite accurate.Everybody yells in this film. There's Howard Beale, obviously, the washed-up anchorman who goes berserk on air and unexpectedly receives a new career as paranoid TV-prophet/evangelist. His ""mad-as-hell"" speech is a legendary piece of cinematic shouting, but the rest of fabulous ensemble cast does their share of shouting too. The network director yells to the head of the news department. The head of the news department yells at the programming director. The programming director yells at everybody, the wife of the head of the news department yells to her husband, random TV-anchors yell at the programming director, etcetera, etcetera.All the yelling is relevant, though, and together the harsh monologues and feisty dialogues form one of the nastiest and most biting satires ever accomplished. The characters are all loathsome, and the higher they are up in the network hierarchy, the more loathsome they become. And, clichéd as that may sound, that is a very realistic and accurate depiction of leadership teams in large companies; - media or otherwise.The performances are, hands down, phenomenal. Not coincidentally half of the cast was nominated for an Oscar, and it's even less coincidental that Paddy Chayefsky won the statue for his script.",Network
21,sunwarrior13,Network Unknowingly Predicts The Future,10,29 October 2011,"The future of television is presented in this film.While watching it,Network unknowingly predicts how the future TV shows would become in the years to come.Network is a satirical film about a fictional television network, Union Broadcasting System (UBS),and its struggle with poor ratings. It stars Faye Dunaway, William Holden, Peter Finch and Robert Duvall and features Wesley Addy, Ned Beatty, and Beatrice Straight.The film was written by Paddy Chayefsky and directed by Sidney Lumet.Howard Beale, the dean of newscasters at the United Broadcasting System, is put out to pasture because he ""skews old."" Network executive Max Schumacher,Howard's best friend, is forced to deliver the bad news. Beale can't stomach the idea of losing his 25-year post as anchorman simply because of age, so in his next broadcast he announces to the viewers that he's going to commit suicide on his final program. Network head Frank Hackett is all for kicking Beale out then and there, but when it looks as though the UBS is going to have its greatest ratings ever on the night of Beale's self-destruction, ambitious programming executive Diana Christensen talks Hackett into treating that fateful final telecast as a special event. Naturally, Beale doesn't go through with it but he does begin rambling about the horrible state of the world in general and television in particular. He concludes his tirade by admonishing his viewers to ""Go to the window and shout as loud as you can: 'I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!'"" With that, Howard Beale becomes the hottest TV personality in America, and Diana becomes the network's fair-haired girl. She draws up plans to treat the nightly news broadcast as garish entertainment (complete with a psychic), all built around the rants of Beale, billed as ""The Mad Prophet of the Airwaves."" The movie was fearless, funny and brutally frank about the state of television and it doesn't take any prisoners.The Writing, performances and direction are all great to make this movie a classic.Faye Dunaway as programming executive Diana Christensen and Peter Finch as Howard Beale,who probably was the prototype of the future TV personalities like Jerry Springer and Howard Stern,shines through all the great cast involved. Added to that,Paddy Chayevsky delivers one of the best screenplays ever written.In summary,Network was one of the best films ever made not only in the 70's but in world cinema.The Academy Awards it has won such as Best Actor for Finch, Best Actress for Dunaway, Best Supporting Actress for Beatrice Straight and Best Original Screenplay for Chayevsky attests to that.",Network
22,Theo Robertson,A Product Of Its Era And Therefore Dated,7,15 July 2010,"NETWORK is very much a 1970s production . This is in no way a negative criticism in itself but does cause the problem that when viewed today it seems somewhat dated . A news anchor threatens to commit suicide live on air ? Sorry to sound unsympathetic but we all have our favourite compelling moments of real news stories . Who would have believed in 1976 that we'd be able to watch in the future a real life TV show where a journalist sets up a sting operation where pederasts come to visit a young teen only to get arrested by the local police . When you've got Chis Hansen confronting predators with razor sharp put downs and sardonic comments fictional satire becomes a very poor second to laugh out loud reality That said it''s always interesting to see a film produced from "" The New Hollywood "" era of American cinema . Director Sidney Lumet had been directing films almost 20 years before he made this but he's best remembered for his 70s films like THE ANDERSON TAPES , SERPICO and DOG DAY AFTERNOON , . Interesting too that these films all contain actors who burst on to the scene during The New Hollywood era and he continues this trend by casting Faye Dunaway and Robert Duvall . He also has a sharp ear for multilayerd sound editing which is something he shares in common with another director associated with New Hollywood namely Robert Altman All in all NETWORK is by no means a bad film just one that hasn't dated well in relation to the work of the "" movie brats "" of that era TAXI DRIVER , JAWS and APOCALYPSE NOW were absolute landmark movies and still remain compelling movies within their own right .

23,Hey_Sweden,Still as relevant as when it was made.,10,9 August 2013,"Extremely biting and memorable satire of television is downright brilliant stuff from writer Paddy Chayefsky and director Sidney Lumet. It's got an intelligent and quite literate script that the actors clearly relish. And the cast is truly something special, in this story of USB, a failing network that decides to exploit the anguish of its news anchor Howard Beale (Peter Finch), who's just been fired. Beale has taken to venting whatever ideas are on his mind, and they think that this is the key to solving their ratings woes. In fact, they go on to do a very damn impressive job of perverting serious journalism with their wacky, cutting edge ideas (they even work hand in hand with a group of revolutionaries who will supply the network with footage of their deeds).Nowadays, of course, the thought of a TV network airing just about anything in order to get attention is not far-fetched at all: it's commonplace. Just consider the scores of lame brained reality shows that have proliferated. So this is one of those interesting films that turned out to be more than a little prophetic. It deals with the whole issue of the ""television generation"", and those people whose lives revolve around the boob tube, whether they work in the industry or not. And now we have an ""Internet generation"", with youngsters obtaining their information online, so the basic themes of this classic film still resonate strongly.An incredible lineup of actors does well with their meaty roles: William Holden, Faye Dunaway, Robert Duvall, Peter Finch, Wesley Addy, Ned Beatty, William Prince, Lane Smith, Beatrice Straight, Marlene Warfield. Finch, who received a posthumous Oscar, is the one we're all likely to remember the most after watching this, but given that some of them like Straight and Beatty only have one big scene, it just goes to prove that adage that ""there are no small parts, only small actors"". Dunaway and Straight also won Oscars for their work. Be sure to watch for Lance Henriksen and Michael Tucker in uncredited bits.Lumets' matter of fact style is perfect, and it's clear that he absolutely trusts the material. It's the kind of film in which you may not always notice or appreciate the more technical aspects because the story is so good. Holden and Dunaway shine when their characters embark on a relationship; he's initially attracted to her and interested by her but eventually comes to worry that she's wrapped up so much in her work that she lacks a soul or much of a heart. They just play this subplot beautifully.While the 1970s weren't exactly lacking in terms of great films, ""Network"" stands tall for this viewer as one of the best of the decade.10 out of 10.",Network
24,preppy-3,Scary,10,28 March 2003,"TV news anchorman Howard Beale (Peter Finch) is being fired off the UBS network after 11 years on the air. He basically cracks on camera and starts swearing and ranting. He's obviously having a breakdown and his best friend and news director Max Schumacher (William Holden) wants to commit him. But the ratings are huge and network execs Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway) and Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall) will do anything to keep him on the air--despite his sanity.Paddy Chayefsky's attack on the TV industry seemed like a wild black comedy/fantasy back in 1976. Chayefskey was warning us what TV was becoming and doing to society. Over 25 years later virtually everything he shows us has actually happened--it's very scary to realize how correct he was. Also there's assured direction by Sidney Lumet (one incredible shot shows Finch raving on TV in the foreground and Duvall in the background) and an incredible cast.William Holden gives one of his best performances ever--you see his pain and confusion as he tries to deal with the insanity all around him. Dunaway (won an Oscar for this) chews the scenery again and again as a network exec who will do anything for big ratings. Duvall and Ned Beatty explode (and yell a LOT) as execs. Beatrice Straight (also Oscar winning) gives a fantastic 5 minute performance as Holden's wife (she won a Best Supporting Actress for being on screen FIVE MINUTES???) . And Finch (his last role--he died before he was awarded the Oscar) goes barreling out of control beautifully.The dialogue is great--people don't talk that way but who cares when the script is this good?

Its not a matter of looking at it now and wondering if time has over taken it, it never worked for me. For me the film simply was ""shocking"" to seem clever even though it never really was.Certainly it hard to look at the film now and not think how psychic it was, but I think that was by accident, or perhaps it was the networks simply copying what they saw here and using it to boost their ratings.The story of a network which radically rethinks what its going to broadcast after its anchorman goes mad and decides to kill himself on camera is ripe with possibilities. The film makers certainly explore many of them, but at the same time each time I've watched it I've always been left feeling like I've missed something, or rather that the film is not as clever as it thinks it is.Try it, but don't feel stupid if you don't get it...I don't think there is anything to get.",Network

It's right in line with the late 60's-early 70's: anti-system soliloquies design to stir the masses.It was probably the best behind the scenes look at television I've ever seen on film. There were almost too many characters from the presidents, directors and others. They even added some ratings talk which was well over my head.

28,evanston_dad,Sidney Lumet Sees Into the Future of American Broadcasting,9,27 August 2007,"""Network"" is hard to describe.It's not hard to see why Sidney Lumet's acidic tirade about American news networks caused a sensation back when it was released. The famous refrain that becomes the mantra of Peter Finch's character, a news anchor who has lost his stomach for the kind of crap he's asked to spew out night after night and decides to do something about it, is ""I'm mad as hell, and I'm not gonna take it anymore!"" This could have been the refrain for America at large in 1976, after assassinations, a failed military conflict and political scandals had pretty much decimated any faith Americans still had in their nation. The fact that that same phrase could be a refrain for America today shows how ahead of its time and relevant this movie was and is. The story seemed outrageous then. Finch's character decides that he's going to kill himself on network television, and the network chief, played by Faye Dunaway in a blistering ball-buster performance, rather than react in horror, sees only the potential for sky-high ratings and a boost to her career. Sadly, in this age of reality television and sensationalistic journalism, the premise no longer seems very outrageous.So as a satire I think ""Network"" holds up expertly, but as a movie, I think it shows its age. Paddy Chayefsky, who wrote the screenplay, stages the film's action as a series of monologues and speeches, and the overall result can be a bit tedious, like a film version of an essay. The writing feels like it might work better on stage than on screen. But Sidney Lumet, who was coming off a high with ""Dog Day Afternoon"" the year before, happens to be a director who's always had a knack for giving stagey material a cinematic quality, so he's perfectly matched with Chayefsky. And there are no quibbles with the acting. Finch and Dunaway are fierce and get the showiest moments, but Robert Duvall and William Holden, in quieter roles, do outstanding work as well. Ned Beatty and Beatrice Straight give two of the smallest Oscar-nominated performances ever. Both each have essentially one scene, but both do quite memorable things with them, and Beatty's in particular is one of the most grotesquely fascinating cameos ever captured on film.An essential film from the 1970s whose impact is blunted now only because the film was so prophetic.

29,HotToastyRag,Classic political film,7,4 November 2018,"""I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not gonna take this anymore!"" is the famous clip from Network, but there's actually a lot more to the movie that doesn't often get remembered. Political science students join film students by studying this movie in college courses; I should know, since I majored in both subjects. In an era that eerily foreshadows the time period we're living through now, technology is the guide to living, and those in power know that if they control the media, they control the general public. Sure, there's no internet or cell phones in the movie, but the basic concept is the same as things stand today. If you're interested, hundreds of essays have been written about the social commentary of Network, and hundreds more have been written about its endurance through the decades.If you're not a political science student, there are parts of this movie that can be hard to watch, so even though you probably chuckle every time you see Peter Finch screaming in a soundbite during a classic movie montage at the Oscars, you should know this is a very heavy drama. The treatment of Peter's character is horrifying, and the feelings he evokes in the audience are probably responsible for his Oscar the following season. William Holden and Faye Dunaway share a pretty graphic sex scene, and while that isn't new for Faye, it feels a little embarrassing to watch a silver screen actor in a bedroom scene. Also, since Bill didn't take very good care of himself, sometimes it's sad to watch his last few movies since he doesn't look very healthy.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children.

30,AaronCapenBanner,All-Time Classic Satire.,10,19 September 2013,"Sidney Lumet directs this Paddy Chayefsky satire about a fictional network(UBS) languishing in the ratings, which strikes gold when, after their recently fired long-time anchorman Howard Beale(Peter Finch) offhandedly remarks on air that he will kill himself, they receive a ratings spike. They send Beale out again to clarify, but instead he gives a stunning editorial rant, and the ratings go even higher. After his rage-filled cry to the viewers telling them to cry out of their windows ""I'm Mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!"" he becomes a superstar, boosting UBS into a top-rated network, inspiring it to create even more wild programs, though their only real interest is high ratings, and if they go down for any reason...William Holden, Faye Dunaway, Robert Duvall, Beatrice Straight, and Ned Beatty are all superb, but it is Peter Finch as the ""mad prophet of our times"" Howard Beale that steals the film. Finch(in an Academy Award winning performance) is unforgettable, delivering a searing, mesmerizing performance of insanity, yet at the same time wisdom, because everything he says comes true in the film, and still holds true today, in which television hasn't only matched the craziness of 1976, but far surpassed it(Reality television of all varieties that is cheap to produce yet shameless and lowest-common-denominator trash.)

32,zetes,Doesn't fully fulfill its promising premise,7,25 July 2003,"An interesting, ambitious, and somewhat entertaining satire of television, but one that pretty much fails for a number of reasons. It's difficult to believe almost everything that happens in it. Not one of the characters rings true. William Holden is as boring in 1976 as he was in 1955, and his cliché relationship with Faye Dunnaway is not at all believable, and not even that interesting. Their scenes together go on forever, and Holden's character carries the trite and obvious metaphor of Dunnaway as television personified, and their relationship as soap opera far further than necessary. Dunnaway herself puts an amazing amount of energy into her performance, and she didn't not deserve the Oscar she won, if you'll excuse my double negative. But her character really is only the metaphor that Holden attributes her, so what ground can she win with that? Beatrice Straight gives a performance that's most famous for being the shortest that ever won an Oscar, only three minutes. I didn't know who Beatrice Straight was, but it's obvious when she starts giving her big speech, so showy that she induced me to roll my eyes as many times as inches tall her Oscar is; that must be a record, too. Robert Duvall fares the best among the major cast members, although he hasn't much of a character either.
Peter Finch's performance is interesting, but his ranting gets old quick. While Howard Beale's first couple of ravings would undoubtedly raise people's interest (the `I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore' scene is as great as it is famous), but I doubt the television show that is developed for him, which apparently airs five days a week and runs for many months before the film ends, would ever attract an audience of any kind, except maybe a small bit who have a taste for public access television, which is what it seems like. I think people, especially the kind of disenfranchised, cynical people to whom Beale's show is supposed to appeal, would be much more critical and suspicious of a man who does his show opposite a psychic and in front of stained glass window.
People always refer to Network as `prophetic,' and then claim their proof is stuff like Jerry Springer, Hard Copy and reality television. As much as some of us may hate those kinds of television shows, only the deranged or stupid would ever believe that When Animals Attack is harmful to anybody other than those who are being attacked by animals. Does anybody really believe that anyone would ever air programs like The Ecumenical Liberation League or whatever that was? Some of the scenes focusing on this new show which the network is developing seem to want to be comedy, although the film is too heavy-seeming to ever succeed in being comic. Anyhow, in the world of reality, in which Holden's character keeps trying to convince Dunnaway and the film's audience that the story is really happening, the network's lawyers would have stopped them immediately. I will say that the film is prescient in only one way: Ned Beatty, who appears for one scene, has the most intriguing part, where he says, among other things:
""It is the international system of currency which determines the vitality of life on this planet. That is the natural order of things today. That is the atomic and subatomic and galactic structure of things today! And you have meddled with the primal forces of nature! And you will atone! Am I getting through to you, Mr. Beale? You get up on your little 21 inch screen and howl about America and democracy. There is no America. There is no democracy. There is only IBM and ITT, and AT&T, and DuPont, Dow, Union Carbide, and Exxon. Those are the nations of the world today."" It comes out of right field in the film - well, kind of. The almighty dollar is the driving force of the film, and, the film realizes correctly, the world. But what Network does not understand is how television works to propagate this system, or perhaps how it would. It's too busy finding its subject, television, overtly evil when it misses the ways it can be more subtly evil. Not that I think all TV is evil or anything. Personally, I watch a lot of television and enjoy it immensely. I don't think it is particularly wicked, and I actually think that there's a lot of great art to be found on television (yes I do!). However, most of the evil I do see comes from the news. I wasn't around in 1976, so I can't say whether or not the news was as suspicious and creepy back then, but, if Network really had been prophetic, it would have at least got some of the satire right. 7/10.",Network
33,Sylviastel,Simply Divine!,10,16 December 2005,"I will always remember this film not for ""I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore"" but for the performances of a first rate cast including the late Peter Finch, the wonderful Faye Dunaway, William Holden, and Beatrice Straight's Oscar winning role as the cheated wife. The story of Network still reigns true today with networks. Everybody wants high ratings and it becomes a brutal, tortured world. Peter Finch's Oscar winning role will be his most famous and one of the last. He died before getting his Academy Award. Faye Dunaway is one of the most talented actresses around and I hear she can be a bit difficult but this role is really a good role but not one of my favorites of hers. I liked her better in Bonnie and Clyde, Chinatown, and later as Joan Crawford in Mommy Dearest. I believe the Oscar was overdue. Dunaway proves that you can be both beautiful, talented, and intelligent as she does in her roles. She always leaves a lasting impression. THe film's two hours smoothly goes by. Actress Beatrice Straight won an Oscar playing William Holden's wife. I was kind of surprised as the supporting because she is in there enough but she does give an excellent performance. With the exception of Dunaway, I believe most of the cast including Straight, Holden, and Finch are gone.",Network
34,Mr-Fusion,"Exciting, outlandish, and frighteningly relevant.",10,26 December 2013,"Two reasons why ""Network"" has me in its grip: 1. Its stellar cast, which features terrific performances from everyone: William Holden, Peter Finch, Faye Dunaway, Robert Duvall and Ned Beatty. Between the crackling dialog and their adept acting, they make this series of people-talking-to-each-other-in-offices captivating. Dunaway makes bitchiness a thrill to watch, and Beatty's firebrand speech is electrifying.2. The script. Aside from the dialog, Chayefsky has created a world in which sensationalism and the almighty dollar trump common decency and the truth. But it's not so crazy because it's eerily prophetic. The news organization depicted herein foreshadows our current media culture; trash/reality TV, current events delivered via ""personalities"", conglomerate-owned news outfits, the very idea of ""infotainment"" - all of it was concocted almost 40 years ago. Every absurdist idea Chayefsky had in this movie has come to fruition. It didn't have to, but we let it happen. To watch ""Network"" is to go back to a time when this ridiculous ratings-at-all-cost television could never actually happen. And the beauty of this movie is that it's able to end on a darkly hilarious note. One that always leaves me with a cynical smile.10/10",Network
35,christopher-underwood,have you seen it recently?,6,20 October 2018,"It is strange coming back to a film you recall as being such a searing satire and finding it rather limp and old fashioned. Time has not been kind to the film, we never had the same TV network competition here in the UK as they had in the States and now most people seem to pop in and out for news headlines and snippets on their phone rather than sit down for an evenings tele watching prompted by your favourite news programme. This is no reason why the film should not work but for me it no longer does. It seems insulting to imagine a nation cheering madly and jumping up and down at the whim of some crazy man. For he is crazy, surely, and the point being that we should not be laughing at the afflicted. But then again, we are told how wonderful the broadcasts are. Unfortunately the dialogue provided is so silly and uninspiring that we wonder how this could ever have ben taken seriously. The 'relationship' between Holden and Dunaway is a case in point. It is introduced to us as a joke and we take it as such, only to realise some way in that this jokey interlude is supposed to be taken seriously. I don't think my Blu-ray disc is very kind to the main participants either. Finch really does look like a madman, Dunaway far too twitchy and worrying and Holden, well looks his age. Shame but this does not seem to have worn too well and it is now hard to believe, even now, how well it is spoken of. I feel prompted to ask those fans; have you seen it recently?",Network
36,siderite,Perception shapes reality,8,19 April 2015,"In this excellent film we get to see the world through the eyes of the media corporations. It all surrounds this news caster who has a psychotic break when he is fired from his decades spanning job. He goes ranting on air, causing him to become a rating sensation that the company decides to keep on air for the sake of profits.What it really is is a comment on society and a warning that television shapes reality, making our world smaller and our lives just scripted clichés. It felt a little too much like a sermon from someone who doesn't understand that the alternative to our reality being shaped by what we see on the screen is to create our own. In a way, that was what happened to Howard Beele.Given all that, though, it was well acted and the script was not too heavy handed to make this film a classic that holds true even today, perhaps especially today. Faye Dunaway was perfect in her role of an emotionless woman who only cares about the ratings of her productions, while William Holden somehow managed to bring to the screen an exponent of decent values and responsible emotion.Bottom line: a great satire on media consuming society and a movie that you should definitely watch.",Network
37,ShadeGrenade,The Angry Man Of Television,10,8 December 2009,"Directed by Sidney Lumet, this holds the distinction of being the very first movie screened on Britain's 'Channel 4', back in 1982. I was glad it was not on B.B.C.-1 or I.T.V. because it would have almost certainly been censored for bad language, and there's plenty of that in 'Network'.Peter Finch plays 'Howard Beale', a veteran news anchor man whose nightly show is losing viewers, and which the station has decided to cancel. One evening, without warning, he announces that, as the show was the only thing in the world that meant anything to him, he intends blowing his brains out - live on air! The incident makes news all over the world, turning Beale into a cause celebre. Millions tune in the next night to see if he will carry out his suicide threat. He does not, but the ratings stay high. The network sees a golden opportunity to exploit Beale's new-found fame by turning him into a latter-day Biblical prophet, a voice for that section of America that is full of rage at what it sees as the decline of moral values. Max Schumacher ( William Holden ), president of the news division and old friend of Beale's, is aghast at what he perceives to be the shameful exploitation of an obviously mentally ill man. But money talks, and the revamped show goes on air. Suddenly the cities of America are teeming with furious citizens yelling: ""I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore!""...That's all I'm going to tell you of the plot. 'Network' is probably the best satire on television ever made, both engrossing and sharply written by Paddy Chayefsky. Such a thing might or might not have been possible back in 1976, but it is certainly possible now. When ex-sports presenter David Icke proclaimed himself to be the Son of God, he was on all the prime-time talk-shows, babbling nonsense such as that espoused here by Beale. The concept of the 'angry' presenter has since been personified by the likes of Bill O'Reilly and Rush Limbaugh.Terrific performances from all concerned, particularly Holden, Faye Dunaway as the amoral 'Diana Christensen', a woman who talks ratings even as she makes love, Robert Duvall, Ned Beatty, but most of all its Finch whom you'll remember. His 'Beale' rivals anything Spencer Tracy ever did. At the end of each of his monologues, your emotions will be in shreds. Sadly he died not long after the film was released, and was awarded a posthumous Oscar for 'Best Actor'. Rightly so.'Network' comes at you like a pair of red-hot pokers in the eyes. Watch it and you'll never look at a news programme in quite the same way again.",Network
38,JamesHitchcock,"""I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!""",9,6 March 2010,"Hollywood and the television industry have long had a love-hate relationship. In the early days of television cinema bosses feared the new medium as a threat to their income, but today the relationship is a much more symbiotic one, with film studios and television networks being owned by the same conglomerates and movies forming a major part of TV schedules. Nevertheless, this close relationship has never prevented the cinema from aiming some sharp satirical barbs at the television industry; examples include ""The Running Man"" from the eighties and Peter Weir's brilliant ""The Truman Show"" from the nineties. ""Network"" is an earlier example of the same phenomenon.The film is about a fourth major television network, Union Broadcasting System (UBS), a fictional rival for ABC, NBC and CBS. The network is struggling with poor ratings and makes the decision to fire Howard Beale, the long-serving anchorman of its evening news programme. Beale reacts badly to this decision, suffers a nervous breakdown and threatens to commit suicide live on air. Beale's old friend Max Schumacher, President of the News Division, allows him one last appearance, but instead of the dignified apology for his suicide threat which Schumacher was hoping for, Beale launches into another outburst claiming that life is ""bullshit"". The ratings soar and the management of UBS decide to exploit Beale's antics, billing him as a ""mad prophet"".The film missed out on the ""Best Picture"" Oscar for 1976, losing to ""Rocky"", but equalled the record of A Streetcar Named Desire by winning three of the four acting awards. (Scriptwriter Paddy Chayefsky won a fourth Oscar). Beatrice Straight may have been a bit surprised to win ""Best Supporting Actress"" for a brief cameo role, but there can have been little surprise about ""Best Actor"" for Peter Finch and ""Best Actress"" for Faye Dunaway. Finch died before the ceremony, making him the first posthumous winner of an award. (The only other posthumous winner has been Heath Ledger, coincidentally also an Australian). In what was to be his last film, Finch gives an absolutely spellbinding performance, playing Beale as a man who is on the verge of madness and yet who has a certain integrity and clarity of vision which the other, saner, characters lack.Dunaway plays Diana Christensen, UBS's Head of Programming. Whereas Beale is a mad visionary, Diana is sane but totally lacking in vision, except perhaps where profit is concerned. She is mercenary, ruthless and utterly cynical, prepared to do anything that will boost the network's ratings. Apart from her exploitation of Beale, her major project is a series entitled ""The Mao Tse-Tung Hour"" featuring a violent gang of urban terrorists named the ""Ecumenical Liberation Army"", clearly modelled on the real-life Symbionese Liberation Army.""Network"" could, in fact, have won all four acting Academy Awards, and probably would have done so had William Holden, who plays Schumacher and gives another excellent performance, been nominated for ""Best Supporting Actor"". I think, however, that it was right that Holden had to battle it out with Finch for ""Best Actor"", as the role of Schumacher is as important as that of Beale. (Indeed, of the two actors it was Holden who received top billing). Schumacher is the one senior UBS executive who realises that there are more important matters in life than television ratings and is horrified by the way in which his friend, who really needs psychiatric help, is being exploited by the network. Nevertheless, Schumacher's integrity is undermined by the fact that he has left his wife to pursue an affair with Christensen, physically attractive but in all moral and emotional matters his complete opposite. Another very good acting performance comes from Robert Duvall as Christensen's equally ruthless boss Frank Hackett.The film came out at a bleak period in American history. The country had just extricated itself from a bloody, unnecessary and humiliating war in Vietnam. President Nixon had been forced to resign in disgrace over Watergate, and his replacement Gerald Ford seemed a dull, uninspiring figure. The economy was going into recession. Although 1976 marked the country's Bicentennial celebrations, many Americans felt that they had little to celebrate. The black comedy of ""Network"" fitted in well with this mood of national disillusionment; Beale's catchphrase ""I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!"" summed up how many people were feeling.The film sees the state of American television as reflecting the state of American society. A key scene comes when the disillusioned Schumacher finally decides to leave Christensen and return to his wife ""You are television incarnate, Diana,"" he tells her, ""indifferent to suffering, insensitive to joy. All of life is reduced to the common rubble of banality."" In 2010, when the media have become even more relentlessly trivial than they were in 1976, those words seem as prophetic as any of Howard Beale's ranting.""Network"" is a more effective satire on television than ""The Running Man"", which suffers from falling into the trap of becoming what it is satirising and also from the casting of the wooden Arnold Schwarzenegger in the main role. I would not rate it quite as highly as ""The Truman Show"", which is very different in tone, being more philosophical and having an upbeat ending whereas that of ""Network"" is very bleak. Nevertheless, this must rank as one of the finest American films of the seventies. Chayefsky's script is sharp, witty and highly intelligent, forcing us (even more than thirty years after the film was made) to take a long, hard look at where our culture and our society are heading. Apart from Kubrick's ""Dr Strangelove"" this is perhaps the best black comedy to have come out of Hollywood. 9/10",Network

40,blanbrn,Excellent film that's provocative and intense. Ahead of it's time it would show what has became today's TV propaganda and it showed how news media impacted culture.,10,30 March 2009,"Finally after 33 years I finally watched this classic film from start to finish. As over the years I would maybe catch a glimpse on Turner Classic Movies from time to time. I must say I'm glad I viewed ""Network"" it certainly holds up to it's praise and acclaim. Made in 1976 when watching it you can certainly say the film was made ahead of it's time, as clearly we see today how TV has turned into propaganda and a media circuit that dominates culture it even influences our political beliefs, eating habits, and social decisions.Long before the FOX News Channel, or Bill O' Reilly who reminds me some of lead character newsman Howard Beale(who tells it like it is and he's mad as hell and not gonna take it anymore!)this film would show and prove that the news had the right to ask questions and fight the powerful. Plus ""Network"" showcased that news could become entertaining and it could mock society much like we see today on shows like ""Real Time with Bill Maher"" and ""The Daily Show with Jon Stewart"". Yet thru it all it also shows the dirty side of the network brass proving they will go to any lengths and measures for ratings at the same time corruption happens just like with any other business.The story based loosely like a satire is well directed by Sidney Lumet and the acting is top notch with an all pro cast of Dunaway, Holden, Finch, and Duvall. Newcaster Howard Beale(an over the top performance from Peter Finch who was the first ever actor to win a posthumous Oscar) has been on top of the news ratings for UBS for years. Yet all of a sudden he's done and his ratings have declined and you guessed it he's ready to get canned. Only after Beale says on his final airing that he will kill himself the network is shocked yet interested at his message as they want to bring him back for another go around. This deal is done with office and corporate politics from executive Frank Hackett(Robert Duvall)who replaces popular and traditional news division head Max Schumacher(William Holden)with the younger and more upbeat and sexy power driven and ratings money hungry entertainment chair Diana Christensen(Faye Dunaway a role she played with passion). When Diana takes over the news division it's spiced up to a more tell it all deal of the truth as the news is more of an act with a live audience a sideshow type. Yet it's only helped by the intense rants of anger and truth telling from Beale (""Who's Mad as Hell, and he's not gonna take it anymore!""). And this is a ratings hit with audiences as it pours money in and it even helps the entertainment department. And Diana patches things up with the outed Max by seducing him.Only the downside as is so common we see the greed with any corporation and the dirty ties it has to the world and how it destroys democracy. As Beale is tipped off on this he starts to tell the people about it even though it hurts ratings. As it proves with greed and money it shows companies are so power hungry that if they can't get good ratings then they will fire or shall I say kill the news host! Crazy way to sign off it still proves in the TV business ratings and money rule as it's the propaganda that makes money. Still people have the right to know the truth and they should be angry the way the world of greed and company corporate distrust has ruined democracy. That's why ""Network"" is such a classic film not only just for those messages, but it was a film that was ahead of it's time as we see today with newsmen like O' Reilly and shows of the like of ""Real Time with Bill Maher"" that was what ""Network"" showcased in 1976. Remember ""Be Mad as Hell and don't take it anymore!"" ""Network"" is clearly a stirring classic that mirrored what TV news has became today.",Network
41,DKosty123,A Great Film About 20 Years After & Before It Was Needed,9,19 February 2017,"This film though not noticed enough now, is one of the great films. Peter Finch put just about everything he has into Howard Biel. In fact he died of a heart attack after the film was released and he was out promoting it. Certain films have impact, and this one still does.In a way, this is a higher budget, bigger star update of the 1950's film ""A Face In The Crowd"" starring Andy Griffith and Patricia Neal. Howard Biel is very much the character Lonsome Rhodes was in that film. The difference is that while the earlier film went totally off the deep end, this one stops at just the right spot. The issue Howard Biel highlights here of Foreign Money and Big Corporations and Big Government taking over the world and screwing the little person- well let's fast forward to when it happened after the movie was made.When Government decided it had to tax Senior Citizens Social Security benefits for starters as this requires some Senior Citizens as high as in their 90's to have to file income taxes. Then they are paying taxes on top of benefits they earned that were already taxed.Then in the 1990's, Howard Biel would have come in handy when NAFTA passed by a corrupt Federal Government, which had started in 1986 to offshore jobs by changing the Federal Tax Code, the working man needed someone to stand up and say ""We're Mad As Hell and we're not going to take this anymore!"" Black people needed it when a huge Federal Program threw thousands of blacks in jail during the 1990's too. Then when the Big Banks talked a willingly corrupt government in the 1990's into deregulating them, removing restrictions FDR put in place to prevent the system from another 1929 meltdown, we needed Biel again.Then in the 2000's, when big drug companies bribed a government into passing a drug law that made them wealthy and then allowed them to put out dangerous new drugs like ""opoids"" without regard with what they do to the public? Of course then 2 political parties who have disregarded any chance of term limits and have made themselves rich by sucking the taxpayers dry like kittens do their mom-ma cat?Could a real Howard Biel have really done anything about that? Unfortunately the answer is no, because the big corporations, big money, mass media and corrupt governments appear to have won since this movie was made. Even though there are 2 great films warning us this could happen, we are at a point today where a whole lot of little people are no longer counted in a system that is rigged.Yes, we should be ""Mad as Hell"" about it, but the out of touch media and those kittens living in a glass bubble still have not woken up as reality is being more hidden today than it was in 1976.With William Holden, Faye Dunaway, and a huge cast, Sidney Lumet brings off a classic here that even has cameos from John Chancellor and Walter Cronkite. This movie portrays things as they are. Heed the warning, and educate yourselves as to what has happened since 1976. Even today's protesters need to watch this to really understand what they are doing, and why.",Network
42,Red-Barracuda,A prophetic movie,10,28 February 2006,"This is a highly intelligent portrayal of the media. Its observations are extremely prophetic; Network has aged remarkable well.The movie may well have seemed far-fetched back in the 70s but the idea of a national TV network going to extreme lengths in order to win more viewers is one that is particularly relevant today when lowest common denominator television is the norm everywhere. And the scene where the Network chief declares that the global corporations are the new nations of the world seems quite an astounding observation considering it was made in a film 30 years old. The references to the counter-culture, however, position the film firmly in the 1970s but this is by no means a bad thing as there is something particularly exciting about films from this period; in many ways the golden age of movies where film-makers were not afraid to make edgy work in the mainstream.The acting is truly first class. There is not a weak performance anywhere here, reflected by the number of acting Oscars garnered. As well as Peter Finch, Faye Dunaway and Beatrice Straight, William Holden and Robert Duvall could easily have won Academy Awards too. In fact, it is just possible that Network has the greatest ensemble acting of any movie.In summary, this is a film that has grown in relevance over the years. It is a fine black comedy about both how power can corrupt and how large-scale corporations are highly sinister and uncontrollable man-made beasts.",Network

44,sddavis63,Powerfully Cynical Satire Of The 70's,5,18 March 2011,"One can't argue the fact that ""Network"" accomplished what it set out to accomplish. It's bitingly cynical from beginning to end - which is a perfect mirror image of U.S. society in the mid-1970's; a nation increasingly cynical, self-doubting and even depressed after years of a steady diet of Vietnam, Watergate, the energy crisis and recession. Little is missed - but the basic point of the movie is the emptiness of the television industry and the mindless and thoughtless generation the media was producing. As Howard Beale (Peter Finch) points out to his audience, everything they know they know from television, because only 3% of them read books and only 15% read newspapers. So the cynicism was a good match for the society in which the movie was made, and much of the philosophizing was bang-on and even prophetic. The performances - mainly from Finch, Faye Dunaway as the Vice President of Programming for the fictional UBS network and William Holden as the head of the news department were convincing in a satirical sort of way, meaning they're not to be taken too seriously except as caricatures of what they represent. I also loved the irony of the Communist Party and the left wing terrorist group being recruited to help with a new UBS ""terrorist of the week"" show and then being shown discussing the details of the contract they were signing. There's also the very relevant point of the news department being taken over by programming and being used for entertainment purposes rather than real news. (The movie is prophetic in that UBS in that sense is a bit of a forerunner to FOX News!) So a lot of this is quite good and worthwhile.Some aspects of this don't hold up quite as well, though. For example, although I found it funny (and I'm not even sure why, except that I grew up in the 70's) that ""The Howard Beale Show"" had performed the unimaginable task (for a new show) of rising to 4th in the ratings - behind only ""The Six Million Dollar Man,"" ""All In The Family"" and ""Phyllis,"" I don't know that this would register with viewers today. The power of television has declined I would say in recent years due to the growth of the internet (although the same concerns might be raised about this modern medium.) Still, one can't really criticize a 1976 movie for having aspects that don't hold up well in 2011. The movie was made for a 1976 audience, after all. Of more concern to me (which accounts for the low rating) was an over-emphasis on personal melodrama. That was perhaps also an accurate reflection of the culture of the day, but I found it distracted too much and too repeatedly from the devastating satire of the TV news industry. I also found that - as good as it was as satire - it was almost too much. Howard Beale stopped being interesting to me fairly quickly, for example.Basically, I'd characterize this as a good example of a good 1970's movie that was made for the 1970's. It still packs a punch, but it perhaps lacks the serious and in depth cultural grounding that it would have had back then.",Network
45,cherold,Brilliant but rarely funny satire,6,9 April 2017,"Network was one of the big films of 1976. It was considered a scathing, brilliant satire of the television age. Yet even though I could see its brilliance, I didn't really enjoy it that much. And forty years later, when I decided to see if I would like it better as an adult than as a teenager, the answer was, no.The script is certainly ingenious and often brilliant. An anchorman loses his mind and gains in the ratings, so the network builds on it, creating a whole show around his prophetic ramblings. At the time the show seemed a perfect satire of the news-entertainment hybrid that was soon to take over American news, but now it's also shockingly predictive of the power of articulating blind rage, which ended up giving us a Donald Trump presidency.It's clever as all get out, and there are some terrific performances, particularly Peter Finch as the madman and Faye Dunaway as a heartless programmer.But there are a number of issues. First off, it's not generally funny. Now, satire doesn't really have to be funny, but what's odd is some scenes are, such as Finch's failed attempt to be less crazy in his second appearance or Dunaway's wildly emotional, date-long monologue about programming. But for the most part, I can admire its ingeniousness while not being all that entertained.It also becomes a bit of a dramatic mess in the second half, most notably in a painfully tedious four-minute marriage-breakup scene that inexplicably stole the Oscar from Jodie Foster (in Taxi). This is also a movie of monologues. Some make sense, like Finch's prophetic speechifying or Ned Beatty's wonderful moment as the God of commerce, but other times, as when Holden tells Dunaway what's wrong with her, the speeches are fantastically artificial and come across as more essay than conversation.It's a brilliant, incisive script, and it's a movie well worth watching. But it's not especially entertaining.",Network
46,sol-kay,Because Your On Television.. DUMMY!,8,3 September 2004,"****SPOILERS**** Howard Beale is given his walking papers and told that he has two weeks left as UBS nightly news anchorman after hosting the news for over ten years on that network the reason: Lousy Ratings. Depressed Howard gets drunk that night with his good friend and UBS News manager Max Schumacher, William Holden.The next night on his news show Howard stuns the TV audience and those in the studio by saying that on his last day as UBS news anchorman he'll end his career in broadcasting by blowing his brains out live on network TV. The rating for Howard's news show hit the roof the next few days. Instead of getting Howard help, who was having a breakdown, the honchos at UBS manager Frank Hackett, Robert Duvell, and program director Diana Christensen, Faye Dunaway, saw a hit in Howard's unstableness and decide to give him a new show ""The Network News Hour"". On the show Howard can act out his ""visions"" about what is really happening in the world around us and what can be done to change whats happening for the better of all mankind. As it later turns out with Howard's truthfulness on the show that this is not exactly the entertainment that UBS top executives wanted.""The Network News Hour"" shoots to the top of the chart but despite the phenomenal ratings, the show take in a bigger share of the TV ratings then ABC CBS & NBC combined. It's telling the people what those in power don't want them to hear, how their being fooled and manipulated by those who are manipulating them. Powerful and informative movie years ahead of it's time that watching it now has a much more powerful effect on you then if you saw the film back in 1976 for everything it brought out then in fiction has become a fact now.The owner of UBS the the world-wide corporation CCA has it's CEO Authur Jensen, Ned Beatty, get Howard alone in his study at CCA headquarters and lays down the law to him in whats the right thing to say as well as do on TV and in the public arena. That destroys Howard and his show by him later telling the public that they, like himself, can do nothing to stop the suffering that those in control are inflicting them with and have to learn just to live with it. The show ""The Network News Hour"" dips in the rating to where it's at the bottom of the heap but Jensen refuses to have the show canceled. He then maniacally puts Hackett and those who he's in charge have Howard assassinated on his show on live TV to keep the network from going under. With that Hackett and those working with him careers from going under as well.One only has to watch TV and the TV news now to see just how ahead of it's time Network was and appreciate it in how it showed not only the reporting of the news on TV but the un-reporting of the news behind the news by the then, as well as now, TV networks. Peter Finch received posthumously an Academy Award as best actor so did Faye Dunaway as best actress as did Beatrice Straight for best supporting actress as Louise Schumacher Max's long suffering wife. who Max was cheating on by having an affair with Diana. The scene where Max confesses his affair to Louise was almost as effective but nowhere as flamboyant as the scene with Howard losing it on the air in living color. Howard in a state of intense and uncontrollable anger and indignation whips up millions of TV viewers all over the country about the state of the news and how helpless he as well as they are in effecting or changing it. Howards big and unforgettable moment in the movie comes by shouting at the top of his lungs ""I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore"".

47,Lejink,Unsocial networking,6,10 September 2009,"Much lauded (on this site) and much decorated in its time, I came to this Sidney Lumet movie with high expectations but was left a bit undersold by the time I reached the end.It starts off with the great premise of fading TV anchorman Howard Beale's on-air suicide wish, but somehow for me didn't follow through as it could have done so that when Beale (Peter Finch) does meet his demise at the conclusion, it's done in a contrived and ludicrous way at odds with the early promise of realism and consistency.Yes I know it's a satire black as night, black as coal, to paraphrase Mick Jagger, but loses a lot for me by placing sympathetic, human characters, such as Beale and William Holden's news editor character against what can only be described as self-serving monsters, consumed with megalomania, such as Faye Dunaway's programme editor uber-bitch and Robert Duvall's on-the-make interloper, keen to exploit Beale's sickness to their own ends.Some of the plot works great, particularly Beale unwittingly tapping into the Zeitgeist of mid-70's American disenchantment with his stream-of-consciousness outpourings against all things big and bigger with his celebrated ""I'm mad as hell"" diatribe, but I couldn't get into the Holden/Dunaway romance or the ""Mao Tse Tung Hour"" sub-plot where we're meant to be amused at proletarian revolutionaries rowing about TV scheduling. There's a lot of speech-making in this film and while it's true no doubt that TV people and the very rich speak a different language to the rest of us, I felt alienated by most of what I saw and heard here.I know we're meant to be all post-revisionist and see Beale's to-camera pieces in the context of latter-day reality TV vox-pops, but really the idea of televising terrorists at work and play, not to mention the mystic soothsayer anticipating news events were ridiculous devices and too divorced from reality then and seem even more so now. Okay, so satire is meant to exaggerate and distort but for me, the film falls off the rails into banality, the more so as it seeks at other points to be so contemporary and relevant that it overloads the screen with references to real-life media people, TV programmes of the day and even background news events.Of course, high-powered, word-heavy fare like this was bound to be heaven and Oscar fodder for aspiring actors and most of the principals tear into their parts with relish. For me though, only Finch and to a lesser extent Holden, (when he's not self-pityingly analysing his relationship with Dunaway), really seem natural in their parts - the rest is bluster and filibuster. Dunaway gets the the most unintentionally funny scene as she climaxes her passion with Holden only as she recounts her TV rating projections in flagrante delicto.I have to say in the end that I don't consider this one of maestro Lumet's best, it's haranguing and somewhat overblown approach leaving me cold. I was actually surprised to learn that this wasn't originally a theatre piece first but would perhaps concede that in that surrounding, the message may have come through more distilled and therefore potent than the drunken, out of control vitriol that surfaced on the big screen.",Network
48,ElMaruecan82,Admirably Intelligent and Scarily Prophetic ...,9,11 January 2011,"""Network"" is a prophetic film from the great Sidney Lumet, that proved its relevance every year since its release. You could use the same script for today, it hasn't aged. That's what makes ""Network"" one of the greatest screenplays ever written. The intelligence, the modernity of the script transcend the film, it's like the most proeminent character. So, the only decent way to start a review of ""Network"" is to salute at first, the brilliance of Paddy Chayefski's writing.""Network"" denounces the evolution of the media and the way they use their far-reaching power for every single element of our everyday lives. Television plays the same role in ""Network"" than the Internet today, still, most of the IMDb users are old enough to remember when Television had a greater impact. But the movie is less about the influence of TV, than the control of big corporations on our lives. The movie is an intelligent satire targeting the business world and the decisional influence of the stock-holders on the economy, therefore -indirectly- on our consumption's habits. We're not people, we're consumers, we're the tools of a system whose only goal is to guarantee advantageous returns on investment. Everything is money.And full of an acid lucidity, this statement means one essential thing : media and especially television, aren't here to entertain you, but to make sure your brain is available to receive subliminal messages of consumption, in one word: advertisement. This is the fundamental basis of TV business, as would say Howard Beale, the rest is ""bullshit"". Time is definitely money and TV managers are not interested in audience because they want people to learn or to be entertained, they have library and sport for that. All they want is a reasonable availability of brain to wash. Announcers rule the media world. Who are the announcers? companies. And who lead companies? Stock-holders. Quod Erat Demonstratum.Indeed, in ""Network"", this logic is constantly demonstrated and deconstructed through the interactions between all the characters, each one brings his or her own dimension to a sensational tragicomic farce performed before our eyes. The central character of this cynical universe is Howard Beale (Peter Finch). Beale, as a has-been performer, by simply announcing his future suicide on TV, caused a chain reaction of events which sent him straight on prime-time as ""an angry prophet denouncing the hypocrisies of our times?"" How? Thanks to a simple catchphrase crystallizing this anger, and supposed to be what the producer of the information program, Diana Christensen was looking for. 1976 was full of memorable movies quotes, ""You talking' to me"", ""Yo, Adrian"" and ""I'm as mad as hell and I'm not gonna take this anymore"" summarizing the spirit of the post-Watergate 70's.The problem for Howard Beale is that he plays his role too seriously, he really denounces the hypocrisy of the times, when in fact he indirectly serves it. Beale is here to improve the audience, Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway) doesn't give a damn about what is said on-screen, as long as the market share and Nielsen ratings are high. Doesn't that ring a bell? Isn't this, THE logic that made TV reality shows possible? Shows where people can be humiliated or authentic sensationalist live reports depicting infidelity, diets or crimes in the most voyeuristic way ... Anything that can attract more viewers is welcome, according to Diana Christensen. She's only good at business, she admits to Max Shumacher (William Holden) her lover and Beale's best friend. She's right, she's not good when it comes to human relationships, she doesn't know how to psychologically behave. But she does know how to psychologically deal with the audience, and that puts OUR position into perspective.Our fascination for Howard Beale, is because we love nonconformist people but here's an interesting question the script asks : if an anti-establishment celebrity appears on TV or media to denounce a system, isn't this already a part of the very same hypocrisy. Isn't the simple apparition on TV or any public media for that matter, already discrediting the message of the philosophy of the speaker? The films gives us a hint, through its clever approach to the political revolutionary activists. Media appear like a corrupting force that destroys anything on its way just to serve the power of finance and stock-holders. People are aware of that, they're the tools of the system, so the only trick to keep them on TV is like a modernization of the whole ""Bread, Wine and Circus Games"" concept. Give them what to consume : logos, brands, pop-culture and then, when they're comfortably seated with the remote control on hand, make them feel powerful like the audience who condemned the gladiators with a thumb down. We all have this sadistic tendency to enjoy seeing other people suffer, voting for this or that candidate. People's humiliation became so banal, we're the instruments of that. TV exploits our ""Shadenfreude"" feeling in a viciously subtle way.Paddy Chayefeski anticipated the psychological and economical predisposition for programs like ""American Idol"", ""Fear Factor"" or ""Temptation Island"", the mentality exacerbated by the Internet, although Internet seems like the antidote to the poisoning effect of TV on minds. But the genius of the script doesn't rely only on this prophetic aspect : the speeches, the construction of the plot, the way each single element perfectly fits in that big corporatist puzzle, is exemplary. And the genius of the film doesn't rely only on the screenplay but also on the performances of the characters, from Holden to Dunaway and Beale, and with the extraordinary cast of supporting characters : Robert Duvall, Ned Beatty, Beatrice Straight, this film is a real acting lesson.""Network"" a brilliantly intelligent satire of the business world with the script as the surplus value.",Network
49,bowmanblue,Still relevant today (almost),7,23 January 2019,"I know it's very controversial to actually want a classic film to be remade and, although 1976's 'Network' still holds up in today's world, the problem with social commentary is that it only applies to the time period it was written about. Now, it does feel a little dated and you could almost see the same film being rewritten with social media (for example) being the central theme, rather than a big cable news network.In 'Network' a news anchorman Howard Beale (Peter Finch) has, what could be described as a 'nervous breakdown' live on air and he ends up spouting off 'anti-establishment' rhetoric which went against the powers in control of the organisation. Instead of firing him (which they nearly did!) they decide to 'use' him and give him his own on-air 'soapbox' in an attempt to keep their enemies closer and, if possible, control him.The other two central characters are played by Faye Dunaway as heartless corporate executive Diana Christensen and a slightly more torn corporate executive played by William Holden, as Max Schumacher. Dunaway is possibly far more memorable as the 'evil' one of the pair, but each have a role to play as they offer both sides of the moral aspect of their actions concerning what to do with their 'pawn' Howard Beale.The film is pretty standard when it comes to direction. There's no real neat camera tricks used that make the film stand out and possibly the editing is the only thing that bothered me. The film is quite long and it does tend to drag in places here and there. It's a bit up and down as you get one classic scene which will stay with you forever, followed by one that doesn't really go anywhere.If you're at all interested in the media and its recent (well, 1970s) history then you'll definitely enjoy this. There is definitely relevance here as to how one person can start trends in order to 'fight back against the powers that be' only to be corrupted completely by the very people he's trying to make a stand against. I definitely think that a modern remake may be interesting (if it was handled right) and social media would be the subject of how the masses are influenced. However, if the subject doesn't interest you then the performances should make it essential viewing for fans of good cinema.",Network

This film is one that film geeks should behold. It's a magnificent film with strong acting, excellent writing, intense dialogue, and great cinematography. I didn't know what to expect, but I got a masterpiece.Sidney Lumet's film is about how a former broadcaster, Howard Beale begins to rant and rave and the network uses those rants for their benefit in order to solidify their ratings.This film is the perfect one to use to teach acting. Peter Finch is very powerful in this role and it's a shame it was his last. He even won the Oscar posthumously which was a first back then. William Holden does an excellent job as Alex, Beale's friend. Faye Dunaway is very, very good here and she captures the essence of her character.Overall, this movie is really something to behold. It's one of the best broadcasting films I have seen and the messages are made clear here. The end of the movie is also very shocking and unexpected. It's a powerful film for sure. I rate this film 9/10.",Network
51,cricketbat,"Interesting, but not as important as many claim",6,3 September 2019,"Network is a lot different than I expected it to be. Instead of a straightforward newsroom drama, it's hyperbolic satire. It's strangely unsettling that this 1976 film predicted the sensationalized media of today. However, the strong beginning and end of this story are bogged down by a slow and repetitive second act. There's also no anchor point, as every character is generally unlikeable. I'm glad I finally saw Network, but I don't quite understand its prominent legacy in film history.",Network
52,secondtake,"A ballsy, funny, tragic, valuable film that makes you want to shout...well, you'll see",9,28 February 2010,"Network (1976)So audacious and loud, and so contradictory, with a sense of hopelessness and empowerment at the same time, it's impossible not to be enthralled. At least sometimes. William Holden is alternatively funny and sad as an news exec, and he makes a powerful central figure, even though the ostensible lead role is the more outrageous and really compelling newsanchor played by Peter Finch. It's Finch who made famous the mantra, shouted by all kinds of people as the movie progresses: I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore. Great stuff. Makes you wish it were true.At least that part of it, the people power stuff. The rest of the plot is really an indictment of the corporate nature of television news. It's a prescient complaint, as the three networks were gradually consumed by three larger, and more insidious (if not downright evil) multi-nationals. (Specifically, CBS is in a complex joint ownership with Viacom, NBC is owned by General Electric, and ABC is owned by Disney, which is on the Dow Jones.) Of course, one wonders if the machinations behind the scenes (deals with corporate boards and ""the Arabs"" mainly) were as selfish, or more selfish, than depicted.But no matter. The idea is clearly fiction, pushed over the top to make a more general point about the falseness of television news and the gullibility of a public either oblivious or willingly duped. Of course, that's only part of the story. There is truth in news, too, either on the surface or gleaned from the coverage, and this isn't really dealt with here. The point of the movie is to highlight what was still a relatively new idea, of a news world unreliable because of the people behind the scenes. (Whether or not that's true.)Of course, the other point is to entertain, and it does that without a hitch. It's a great movie on several levels, and it's a flawed movie on several others. As much as Finch and Holden impress, Faye Dunaway sometimes overacts and rings false. The camera-work, lights, and blocking are all worth noting--even simple situations (people in an office) are handled with a great sense of space, movement, drama, and plain old beauty. It's a gorgeous film. See it big and turn up the volume. It's that kind of movie.",Network

Therefore, poor Max Schumacher (William Holden), a friend of Howard's and head of the news department, has to give his colleague the bad news. Howard is getting axed. The two go out drinking and think back on the funniest moments in their years together. But, oh, the next night is full of surprises! Howard still has two weeks to go and he announces on air he plans to kill himself on air over his firing. The network's upper bosses are aghast. But, lo and behold, everyone is interested in watching what comes next and the ratings rise. This gives calculating, career-driven Diana (Faye Dunaway) the chance to plan more new shows for the entertainment side of things. Why, terrorism will be featured on one show called the Mao Tse-Tung Hour! And her staff better come up with more insanely great ideas. The attractive but lethal Diana turns Max' head and they move in together, ruining his marriage. More importantly, Howard is such a star now that they let him continue and rant and rave on many topics. This involves the classic scene where he implores everyone to go to the window, open it, and shout ""I'm mad as h*ll and I'm not going to take it anymore!""

55,vincentlynch-moonoi,"Amazing film, but some aspects dated",7,14 January 2012,"It's rare that I give a film an ""8"", and I was going to give this film that rating...until I got deeper into the film. To get that rating from me, the film usually has to be something that is truly different and done extremely well. Reviewer Vincent Canby wrote that this film is ""outrageous...brilliantly, cruelly funny"". Indeed it is remarkably different, while still being a mainstream film. I saw it at the theatre in 1976, and maybe once on television...so it was a while before I saw it again...recently on TCM.It's difficult to fault a single performance here. Faye Dunaway is great as the ratings-hungry producer. William Holden is wonderful as the aged news executive. Peter Finch is remarkable as the crazy old news anchor. Robert Duvall shows his skills as a new-wave executive trying to life a network out of the doldrums. It's interesting to note that Walter Cronkite's daughter appears as a Patty Hearst figure! One of the best scenes in the film is one that probably most people don't remember -- where Holden tells his wife (Beatrice Straight) that he is having an affair with Faye Dunaway. Straight is magnificent. Ironically, she won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for this role -- the shortest acting performance in a film to do so -- for a part that lasted only five minutes and forty seconds! Another remarkable scene in the film is Ned Beatty's rant as the highest executive of the network. And Howard Beal thinks he heard God! But the film does have some shortcomings, in my view. First, where is even a single character to like and respect? How many of us really want to watch a nearly 60 year old William Holden have sex with a yellow-toothed Faye Dunaway, and learn that he suffers from premature ejaculation (and BTW, I'm in my 60s, so I can say that!)? Does the part of the plot about a Symbionese Liberation Army-like organization make this film seem unnecessarily dated? And what does that part of the plot really have to do with Howard Beal going nuts? And, to me, its biggest shortcoming is its ending. All along the film has been a psychological drama. Then, to take away declining ratings, they suddenly decide to have Beal shot to death on the air. The rest of the film I could almost believe...but not that ending. And then we never learn what happened to the network executives or old man William Holden. Nope. It ended like they simply ran out of time and couldn't devise a better ending.Looking at this film now, some 35 years after its release, it is still a wonderful film, but its topicality in 1976 gives it a somewhat dated feel now. So my ""8"" dropped to my more normal ""7"". Still worth a place on many DVD shelves.",Network

60,tomgillespie2002,Incredible piece of prescient cinema,9,5 January 2012,"American cinema in the 1970's revealed a more personal, ""gritty"", and quite often profoundly moving. This was in part due to the ""changing of the guard"" at the studios that began happening in the 1960's. The Moguls that had created the studio system, and also the golden age of cinema, were leaving, and the studios were being sold off to corporations that had no connection to the cinema industry. This led to a multi-million dollar industry being run by companies such as Coca-Cola; therefore, the studios were being run by people who did not know what makes money. Fantastically for the new film makers, this led to a certain amount of freedom, and produced some of the most challenging and interesting films. It seems to me that this all occurred simultaneously with some interesting social and political challenges in the real world.In the media throughout the 1970's, there were many stories about political kidnappings (such as the well-known Patty Hearst kidnapping that had the world gripped through the bizarre change in the newspaper heiress and socialite who eventually became a member of the terrorist gang), and of course the biggest political story of the decade, the Watergate incident. This latter event highlighted the inconsistencies of political power, and (along with the JFK assassination in 1963) almost essentially created the conspiracy theory - and the modern political conspiracy was born, and is now a popular part of culture. So it seems incredible today that under this atmosphere of paranoia, and particularly with the corporate mergers of industries, that Network was made - a film that is mainly about a television network that is going through changes after a corporate merger/takeover.""I'm mad as hell, and I'm not gonna take this anymore!"" This is the mantra of Howard Beale (Peter Finch who won a posthumous best actor Oscar for this role), anchorman of the UBS Evening News, who at the start of the film, is told that due to poor ratings, he was to be fired. On his next broadcast, Beale announces that he will kill himself in a live broadcast next Tuesday. This of course creates a bit of a media sensation, and the interest in the anchorman extends, making the network executives take notice. This leads to the freedom for Beale to have a platform in which he berates the consumerist world, along with the machinations of the financial and media industries. Whilst the ""downfall"" of Beale's psychology seems to be the main event in this film, he is simply a protagonist that gets the narrative going. the main focus here is the relationship between news executive, Max Schumacher (William Holden) and the younger programming executive, Diana Christenson (Faye Dunaway). This relationship is essential to the narrative. This is where we discover that she will stop at nothing for the acquisition of ratings and therefore money, and that Max, whilst obviously enjoying his affair with the young woman, is fundamentally concerned with Beale's well-being.This last point raises an interesting question about the nature of sanity. Whilst the money-men in the executive offices simply look at the ratings boost, and care less about the content, Max is worried that his friend is losing the plot. Of course this would be easy to say when we see Beale, soaking wet and dishevelled, ranting in a seemingly frantic manner. However, the fact that he is voicing opinions that were very popular at the time, shows that maybe he has in fact had enough of the machinations of the ""system"".To say that the film is still relevant today is an understatement. In fact, much of what occurs in the film has become very much an everyday reality. So it could be argued that the film was an incredible piece of prescient cinema. Network has an amazing cast, and all performances are first rate - particularly Ned Beatty's small role, where he informs Beale of the future of industry which is stunningly shot also. Network should be celebrated in the same way that other films of the decade are, such as Taxi Driver (1976). It has utterly relevant social commentary, and rings as true today as it did 35 years ago - perhaps a depressing thought, highlighting that nothing has really changed, and that in fact, we are living in an unchanging civilisation that has only one obsession: Money.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Network

62,Dr_Coulardeau,Fake true ideas and real false truths,9,2 November 2008,"It could have been a great film. It had all it needed to be a masterpiece. It debunked the old traditional boring television of our great grand parents, that television that was speaking all the time in order to bring us the truth, to teach us the true truth, to make us believe every word they said was absolutely inspiring and we had to be thankful and grateful for this new medium to be so effective in teaching us, in lifting us out of our ignorance. They treated television as a super book, an encyclopedia and they had not understood the slightest smallest element of what this medium was. They had not read Marshall McLuhan and when they had heard of him they thought he was trite, insignificant and purely ranting and raving. And they were going to learn the power of this medium the hard way. One day, by accident, due to the neurotic caprice of one of the team, they discover the tremendous power it has on the imagination and on the behavior of people. People believed the antic as if it were true, absolutely true because it was live and unexpected, hence true since un-programmed. And the newer generation ran into the opening and they invented that television that immerse you into live reality through purely virtual and fake images, even when they are really live, because the camera is a processor, an intermediary eye that gives you what they want you to see and the objective is to make you feel happy, serene, or even angry but with the serenity of the certitude that you are not alone and that everyone is as angry as you are, and that you cannot stand reality any more and that this is absolutely justified since millions of people are feeling the same way as you at the very same moment. Television is not supposed to make you think but only to make you feel part of a vaster reality, of a large vital movement. And that's where the film becomes bad because it seems to follow the idea the older generation is airing at the younger one that this television is shutting everyone onto themselves, separating them from all others, individualizing them into absolute isolation. False, false, false again and again. This new television is soaking you individually into the images of the reality the way this TV wants you to see it, but that is only part of the business. You accept this experience of being dipped and at times thrown or drowned into the boiling maelstrom of violence, war, crime, horror, etc, because you know you are not alone, because it gives you the sense of belonging to a vast mass of people and the possibility to share that common experience with them all tomorrow morning without even having to tell about it. One word will be enough to bring that never directly experienced community back to the subconscious mind of the millions of people who have watched the same show. News is not about truth or about teaching. News is show business, news is emotional and even psycho-dramatic sensations, an experience in surrogate horror, both liberating (cathartic the older ones would have said) and enslaving the proud isolated individual you do feel you are becoming with all that television to the crowd of viewers. And all that is of a commercial nature. The ratings are supposed to bring in advertising and money and when the sensation that started it all does not work anymore because the man, the guru, the anchorman, the preacher does not understand that he cannot start telling people they are living in a dictatorship, even and especially if it is true, you have to get rid of him. The end is quite simple-minded: kill him with guns and bullets. Television can kill someone in so many other ways that are symbolical, mediatic, bloodless but just as effective, efficacious and even cruelly efficient. And the producer of the film knew from scratch all that truth indeed since this producer, Ted Turner, had been refused by the CBS and was in the process of creating the CNN, the acme of reality news and reality television only dealing with the real world and bringing the millions of people of its globalized audience a predigested vision that was only targeting at homogenizing the mediatic mind-formatting experience and consciousness of the world. Virtual reality is the true reality, and that is the very power of this medium that we cannot deny nor reduce to something else, even if teaching real ideas and arguments. Television is an all-sensorial experience building device for individuals who want to belong to a consensual mass.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",Network
63,poe426,Requiem For A Heavyweight...,10,3 September 2013,"There's a scene in REQUIEM FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT where Anthony Quinn (who's had his clock cleaned by the up-and-coming young heavyweight contender, Cassius Clay- a.k.a. Muhammad Ali) learns from his less-than-forthright manager (played by Jackie Gleason) that he's no longer a viable candidate for Heavyweight Champion of the World and will thereafter find gainful employment as a professional wrestler. Mickey Rooney, playing Quinn's trainer, feels that Gleason has sold their man out, has kicked him to the curb once he's outlived his usefulness. In the closing moments of the movie, we see Quinn, done up as a caricature of an American Indian, replete with headdress and tomahawk, stomping about the ring before his wrestling debut. Just the other night, I happened across a similarly sad scene: Keith Olbermann, who had spoken Truth to Power for years as a political commentator, was once again in front of the camera (after a prolonged absence)... talking sports. Television can be the most unforgiving of mediums. With Uncle $cam once again flexing his muscles prior to The Department of Offense mopping up the floor with Syria (a tune-up bout for The Big Fight to come, with Iran) and Fukushima hemorrhaging hundreds of millions of gallons of radioactive waste into the ocean (where it'll combine nicely with the oil in the Dead Zone already 50 miles in diameter, said Dead Zone courtesy of our good friends at BP), NETWORK is once again a timely film. Islam may have its prophets, but our Military Industrial Government has ITS profits- thanks in no small measure to The Networks. In NETWORK, when Faye Dunaway suggests getting a psychic to do the news, William Holden's character sensibly suggests they hire a psychic to do the weather. Like most Televangelists, Howard Beale (Peter Finch) ""hears voices."" ""The People don't want to know the Truth,"" he learns. ""The FCC can't do anything,"" Robert Duvall says: ""We're a whorehouse network."" Aren't they all? They preach ""high moral standards,"" while appealing in the main to the lowest common denominators. TV is the electronic equivalent of comic books. The only time it's something MORE is when it speaks Truth to Power- which it hasn't done on any of the mainstream ""news shows"" for decades. ""Money makes the world go 'round,"" Ned Beatty tells Beale: ""We no longer live in a world of nations and ideologies. The world is a college of corporations inexorably determined by the immutable bylaws of business. The world is a business, Mr. Beale."" That's the Holy Dominion of Dollars, folks. Beale: ""What's wrong with being an angry prophet denouncing the hypocrisies of our times?"" Ask Keith Olbermann.",Network

65,TheMovieDiorama,Network broadcasts its televisional corruption through satirical poetry that beckons democratic madness.,9,8 November 2019,"""I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore"", screams Howard Beale from the confinement of his studio desk. Exerting his ornate insanity upon the entranced viewers who innocently stare at their cubic televisions, watching the news broadcast fuelled by media misrepresentation and propaganda. ""Go to your nearest window and scream"", acting as the voice of the working class, benign to the American corporate fundamentals that masquerade the politics of democracy. In an age where leading actors can represent constituencies or states, and businessmen can be presidential candidates for a nation (and successfully winning...), Lumet's timeless satire on conceptualised democracy is one that grows more appropriate with each passing decade.A statement on the American financial system, where colossal stock markets rule the supposed freedom of the people. Broadcasting networks more focussed on combating against each other for monetary viewership, leading to exaggerated fabrications, rather than reporting the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Exploiting the frail mentality of humanity to feed the greed and lust of ""humanoid"" managers, capitalising on the naivety of man.Network depicts the modern evolution of communicating false truths. As technology evolves, we grow more and more susceptible to the ""truth"" that is conveyed to us. We, much like sponges, absorb the information demonstrated through the porous pixels that we subject our eyes to. Televisions. And through hyperbolised satire, including planning an assassination attempt and coercing suicidal tendencies, Lumet offers a cutthroat insight into broadcasting institutions and the meticulous methods in which networks function. Motivated by stock shares and rating dominance. Pioneering the consumption of propagandist material. Lumet exploits the audacious power of televisions and its communicative abilities, turning an often comedic satire into a transcendental horror feature.Powered by sterling performances all-round, including the elusively commanding Dunaway, the maddening lunacy of Finch and the smoothly suave Holden, the poetic dialogue immediately captures the attention of its audience. Concisely elaborate with a hint of existential analysis, an ornate lexicon that refrains viewers from tuning out. Lumet's long sumptuous takes, allowing the performances to ironically hypnotise, further extend the reach of its material. Superlative direction that, whilst suddenly throws you into the immediate chaos of Beale's mentality, eases the hectic pace with its scathing power.The offscreen affair between Dunaway and Holden was the only underdeveloped sub-plot, reinforcing her workaholic agenda that likened her to a corporate machine than to a human with emotive capabilities.Aside from that, Network absolutely deserves its near-perfect acclaim. A considerably profound illustration of the American system that tantalisingly exposes the fraudulence of promised conceptualised democracy, whilst also enforcing the relinquishment of humanity through television sets.

66,SAMTHEBESTEST,Outrageous take on Dirty and Horrible World of TV Media makes fool out of audience with Insufficient Ending.,6,9 July 2020,"Network (1976) :
Brief Review -Outrageous take on Dirty and Horrible World of TV Media makes fool out of audience with Insufficient Ending. If you remember Oscar Winner flick 'Spotlight' then you know how Media or Journalism can bring a positive change in society and the other Classic flick involving TV media and Shows comes in my mind is 'A Face In The Crowd' where excessive greed of a popular TV star takes him down. I loved these two films because they had a concrete vision and firm thoughts to end the story. Spotlight brought an Important Issue and spread positive revolution message and A Face In The Crowd showed how bad you will have to pay when you try to fool audience. Unfortunately, Network failed to do both the things despite exploring dirty world of Media so outrageously. It's a story of a Media Broadcast Channel, trying every lousy thing and filthy stuff just to bring Ratings. They just don't care about people and thier sentiments, all they care is only and only High Rating. And after all at the end you see them Killing a Man because he had lousy ratings and still get away with it? I mean how? Why didn't they see any downfall? What actually happens after that horrible murder? I mean how can you kill an innocent man just because you want High Ratings? Why wasn't there any punishment? I couldn't find answers of these questions and that's why i couldn't just Like the film. Even the characters of the film are quite abnormous. The brainy dame Faye Dunaway, doesn't care about her own life and love, she only wants Rating and she is the one who actually kills the man and still get no punishment. William Holden is a man with No Morality, he leaves his wife and family after spending 25 years happily for the dame and at last he realises that he was wrong. So typical and Dumb it is. Rest characters were at least understandable but these two doesn't make any sense and yet end up having most of the screenspace. Actors are fantastic in roles though and 2 deserving Oscars trophies came for them, it's writing that made me reluctant. Screenplay goes smoothly and generates interest but spoiled by the incomplete and foolish climax. I would have loved to see the Channel and those greedy people falling down like a demolishe tower and thier debris but all they had to show was to make fool out of audience. You can't fool audience, neither in the film nor out here. Audience is smart enough to make a right choice after seeing all this pediculous politics and obscene conspiracies, aren't we? In filmmaking there is nothing much wrong, whether is it acting, dialogues, cinematography and direction but the complete and positive ending is missing badly. The outcome post climax in unclear, that's what makes those evil win the battle over us audience which is not at all appropriate for me. Overall, a good attempt but not a Great Film as it is has been decorated since release.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest",Network
67,Movie_Muse_Reviews,A film about dark side of the media and consumerism anchored by dynamite performances,9,15 April 2011,"During parts of ""Network,"" you have to wonder if it's a joke. The exploitation of a lunatic news anchor/prophet for financial gain with society just buying right in? Nuts. ""Network"" can definitely be viewed as an extreme and an unlikelihood, but that's not to negate its powerful message and frightening ideas about media, consumerism and society in general.Howard Beale, played by Peter Finch, the first posthumous Best Actor winner in Oscar history, (which adds an all-too-freaky layer to the film's effectiveness), is about to retire from reading the news after ratings have bombed and he's become disenchanted with the industry. On air, he promptly announces he will, in a week's time, blow his brains out on the 7 o'clock news. What first becomes a PR nightmare for Beale's station, UBS, evolves into a godsend when Beale goes on the air to apologize but delivers an impassioned speech rousing Americans out of their funk with his war cry: ""I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore!""The dominoes begin to fall for various minds behind the network as a result of Beale's sudden fame. The first is Diana (Faye Dunaway), a tough-as-nails producer from the programming side who crosses over into news with ideas of sensationalizing it. She creates ""The Howard Beale Show"" to capitalize on the media spotlight on Beale and seizes success on his coattails. Dunaway creates in many ways a terrifying portrait of a woman who seems part robot in that she's only emotional when it comes to her singular purpose of making high-rating television. Her love affair with William Holden's middle-aged Max Schumacher, a casualty of the network's new direction, serves as allegory for old and new generations of media. Not exactly a believable relationship, but a fitting metaphor. A famous actor from Hollywood's golden years, Holden fits in his role perfectly. He paints Max as a pitiable lost soul.Other personalities include Robert Duvall as Frank, the in-between for UBS and the media company that owns them and Ned Beatty as Jensen, the man upstairs. Interestingly, ""Network"" has nothing to do with the journalism side of a newsroom but the business side. Paddy Chayefsky's powerful script at its most fundamental level shows the dark side of the media, the business side, the side with a flagrant disregard for the ideals of journalism.With a lot of dialogue, ""Network"" could not have been in better hands than those of Sidney Lumet. Lumet gets the most from his actors and adds an extra power to the many speeches throughout the film. Beatrice Straight barely appears in the film yet steals a scene in the middle. She plays Max's wife, who goes off on him when he says he loves Diana. It's a riveting scene with brilliant writing, but does Straight win Best Supporting Actress without the help of Lumet? ""Network"" contains a great deal of screaming and shouting yet little of it comes across as ""noise"" because he handles it so delicately.The ensemble really carries ""Network"" on its bizarre ride. The likelihood of a news anchor going on TV and successfully convincing Americans to open their windows and shout that they're ""mad as hell"" seems implausible, but the media has changed so much since 1976, more so than the changes the film depicts from the ""good old years"" of broadcast news up until that point. News anchors were the final word back then, but with the Internet, news and information can be found by the consumer. A sequel or maybe more like a follow-up to this film could be even more harrowing.Chayefsky's knock-out script suffers a tad from pacing, but few films are so packed with ideas worthy of day-long discussions on end. There's so much to think about between the various relationships between the characters and what's at stake for each of them and how blown out of proportion everything is. One of the many scenes that puts it all in perspective is during contract negotiations for a show Diana has put together that would follow a Communist liberation group on its terrorist escapades. There's a huge argument between members of the group amidst the network employees and so the leader fires his gun to get them back on task to talk about subsidiary rights. It shows how ridiculous the whole show has become as everyone wants a piece.""Network"" serves as a cautionary tale on numerous levels. It starts as simple as news programming and grows as large as big business' control on the world and its governments. Lying beneath the surface for all of it, however, lurks what can happen when personal interests guide important decision-making as it effects what the general public will see. Major media does not have as much control on what the public sees and hears as it used to because there are more outlets for obtaining the news, but the economic troubles of news media in our time has not made it any less dependent on selfish corporate interest.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com",Network

69,funkyfry,solid,8,26 December 2007,"I was very impressed with Paddy Chayefsky's ""Americanization of Emily"" and though I didn't care for this one quite as much, it was well worth the emotional effort of watching. I do mean ""emotional"" because following the characters' perspectives through the course of the film means opening yourself to a whole slew of contradictory feelings and ideas. It's certainly an effective satire of America's fascination with violence and the elusive value of truth, but at times the satirical elements clash with the thoroughly developed characters. In the end I didn't think the joke of having Beale (Peter Finch) killed by revolutionaries hired by the Network really paid off the investment I made in his character. I also feel the film is a bit too heavy-handed in its treatment of the whole concept of a ""TV generation."" It's fun to watch these actors do their work  Bill Holden was very well cast, and the contrast between Holden and Robert Duvall utilizes the parallel between Old/New Hollywood and Old/New Media. Duvall played an impressive variety of roles in the 1970s and it's hard to compare this performance to others that he gave in his career but he was suitably cold and distant as the corporate heel with no respect for objectivity in news. Holden I thought fantastic; his work here actually compares with the best work he did in his career such as for Billy Wilder in ""Sunset Boulevard."" It's very difficult to play this type of character because he's a man who thinks about everything he says and obviously chooses his words carefully  in fact this straightforward manner seems to be the key to his connection to Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway). But as an actor you can't betray a thought process with the dialog; that makes the lines feel forced. Holden does an extraordinary job in my opinion of basically bringing intellect to the character without showing us the intellect of the actor. I can't say I've ever seen him better.Same goes for Dunaway although personally I thought her character was too superficial to be aligned very realistically with Holden's. Is she a character on his level or more like the passing parade or revolutionaries and mystics who populate her programs? Perhaps the point is that Max (Holden) is trying to find a way to be comfortable in the new media world, to have a real connection to it. Because Diana is so self-conscious perhaps he believes there's a potential for their relationship to become substantial, but he doesn't seem to let his wife (Beatrice Straight) in on this if it is the case  he represents the relationship to her in strictly emotional terms. I think actually a lot of the film's substance as far as I can see it is found in that odd domestic confrontation. What struck me was how she insisted on his saying the words: ""I'm in love with her."" Words are very important to these people, but not so much to the younger generation. Being precise with your words and saying exactly what you mean is important to them. And that even goes for Arthur Jensen (Ned Beatty), who is willing to endanger the Network itself so that Beale (Finch) can spread a very specific corporate gospel.Maybe I'm speculating too widely considering I just saw it for the first time, but it seems like Chayefsky is having a bit of revenge  a writer's lament for the ""TV nation."" The new generation he criticizes knows only images and don't have access to the real feelings of life that the written word could presumably bring them closer to. ""Turn off your TV, right now while I'm in the middle of this sentence!"" Looking back at this film now, in an age where popular film has descended to the level of 70s TV or even below, it seems like a last ""hurrah"" for the written word as well as the larger possibilities of film and theater where no holds are barred and nobody is even thinking about sequels or a ""series."" On a first viewing the only thing that kind of throws me is the mixture of serious drama with satire, producing an effect where the characters seem too real to be placed in some of the more ridiculous situations that the story puts them in. Too much time is devoted to the Communist Party/guerilla storyline, regardless of whether that element is more dated or not at this point.So, it isn't quite as consistent as ""Emily"" or Southern & Kubrick's ""Dr. Strangelove"" but it's pretty close in overall quality and it actually benefits from the drama/comedy mixture in ways that I've never really seen before. At this point after first watching it the condemnation of the ""TV generation"" seems too sincere and direct to satisfy my idea of the best satire. I think it's admirable to give these characters a lot of dimension for the most part, and a lot of care has gone into the performances and the dialog, but the satire seemed to me to undermine that seriousness and at the same time the seriousness itself didn't really enhance the satire.",Network
70,imseeg,Still stands strong. Still as important and actual as it was 45 years ago. Brilliant dialogue and impressive acting performances. All time CLASSIC.,9,30 June 2020,"I cant think of another movie in which everyone SHOUTS as much and with as much ANGER as in Network. But it isnt shouting because of a gimmick, it is shouting out of REAL ANGER, out of real inner frustration, in which emotions explode to the surface, but in a real life, credible way, with detailed portrayal of all the human insecurities and vulnerabilities.And the characters in this story shout for a reason, because they get squashed by the corporate world of commercial television, which is the profit seeking monster, that will do anything to get higher ratings, even televising a mad man, who isnt mad at all though, but simply says what everybody else is thinking. The leading character (a news reader) in this movie is more of an angry prophet, warning people for the systematic destructive powers of corporate television.Timeless classic about the vulgarity and ruthlessness of television.Terrific dialogues and great acting performances! I am amazed that it still has such a profound impact on me in 2020, after having seen it several times over the past decades...",Network
71,jzappa,"Seeing the Future: Energizing, Inspiring, Foretelling",10,28 October 2008,"The simplest testament to this American masterpiece is that the character of Howard Beale, played rivetingly by Peter Finch, stands out in the majority of people's recollections of the film, soaking wet in his raincoat, looking almost like a raving alcoholic at a bus stop, shouting, ""I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore!!!"" This line has become a part of American dialect to the point where pretty much everyone has a variation of their own. What makes this such a tribute to the movie is that the character, not that he is peripheral by any means, is merely the movie's sideshow-act framework.What is energizing and inspiring about Paddy Chayefsky's script is how slickly it alters its tone. The drama is powerfully written and acted, but it remains up in the clouds with the scenes involving Beale's rants and the Ecumenical Liberation Army, which are gleefully exaggerated. The jargon, pace and personas among the network execs secure a very convincing, documentary realism, but we have no skepticism that the idea that a Howard Beale sort of show would be discussed at the corporate level as the film evokes. And then Chayefsky and director Sidney Lumet creep the realistic network drama over into send-up as well, but with Lumet's subtlety so that in the ultimate meeting where the execs settle on what to do about their quandary, we do not feel cheated into a silly finale because we have subliminally bought into the lunacy. In this sense, I can definitely see why this is Paul Thomas Anderson's favorite movie. All of his films, Boogie Nights and There Will Be Blood in particular, have moments that could so easily be ridiculous, but the cynical tone grants them seamless shift.Seen a quarter century later, Network is like foretelling. And while it seems that I should just be saying that because oh it's such a brilliant movie and it's one of my favorites, it really infuriates me. What Network was raving about via its Peter Finch character and all its edges and points in 1976 caused a great sensation and, as I said, integrated itself into pop culture. Why are the very issues showcased the precise ones that present dire troubles today? Valuable facts or news is today not nearly as important as what makes the viewer panic, or fulfills cheap thrills. We watch and absorb that when Howard Beale, at the end of his rope by the time the film opens, begins to be completely and utterly frank on live television, indicating very alarming points about American society at large, he is a smash hit because his shock value is great for ratings. One of Chayefsky's essential understandings is that the movers and shakers don't really mind what you say on TV, provided that you don't fluctuate their earnings by saying it. Howard Beale demands public fury, he even urges viewers to turn off their TVs, but he only arouses a real reaction when he exposes the network's arrangement to sell their parent company to Arabs. Thirty years later, not a thing has changed.Opposite this extravagance is the affair between Holden and Dunaway. In what is, from what I've seen, her strongest performance, Dunaway is grippingly befitting as the---literally--- obsessed programming executive. See, the film's satire is not so much laugh-out-loud funny as it is a tongue-in-cheek approach to its subject: She moistens her lips seductively when she imagines boosted ratings, she goes to bed with Holden while chattering about how economically she can buy slots for James Bond movies. Only about three seconds after the sex begins, she has an orgasm while panting about a concept of hers called The Mao Tse Tung Hour.Just as if not more influential is Holden's performance as a newsman who was trained by Edward R. Murrow, and now sees his beloved news division destroyed by his lover. At the same time, Max is awestruck by her, and purposely has an affair. For him, it is being under the influence with the wrong side of things. I find it funny that Holden has starred in a cynical insider movie about the Hollywood studio system, Sunset Boulevard, and a cynical insider movie about the TV network system, Network.I don't know if I would have given Beatrice Straight an Oscar for her role as his wife. I mean, she basically has one five, ten-minute scene. But, from the moment she appears she has prepared a compelling rendering of a woman who has put up with an insufferable man to whom to be married for so many years that, even if she feels enraged and deluded, she has already been disillusioned to the idea that he could do what he has done. Lumet underscores the meaning of Max's decision to cheat by showing that he and his wife live in an attention- grabbingly refined residence with walls of books and elegant furniture, which goes beyond contrast to Dunaway's cheap place, which we hardly notice, save for maybe a Singin' In the Rain poster briefly. It is clear that she doesn't care where she lives, because she is restless and undemanding of affection or sensitivity. Her home is in a corner office.The film is packed with vivid supporting characters. Not a single person is scenery. And one is obliged to mention Ned Beatty's unforgettable scene as a TV executive whose powerhouse monologue paints him as an evangelical figure, the scene punctuating with a touch of surrealism.Network, from which I can most definitely see where Anderson absorbed a lot of his style and approach, especially in scenes like Beatty's, is seldom considered a director's film, but actually a writer's film, which is one of the rarest things a movie can be. Yet, it is Sidney Lumet's discreet expertise that lets all the interpretation and degrees of energy to live as a part of each other, as one within the same film.",Network
72,videorama-759-859391,Network this,10,22 June 2016,"Network is one of those true blue originals, and a movie that stands out, during the whole 70's era, and is truly undying. The movie purports many messages about television, but specially ratings. When long time, respected anchorman, Howard Beale is fired, (the late great Finch) he announces live, that he's gonna kill himself on t.v., this sets off ratings to fly through the roof in coming weeks, where once weekly, we follow Beale's qualms and issues on his own show, where shockingly heartless reporter (Dunaway, in a dynamic sexy performance) sees this as a shot for her own personal success, while bedding network executive, William Holden (lucky him), which later complicates his marriage, while also being supportive to long time, friend, Howard. When ratings start to drop, the network, sees Finch, as a threat, who refuses to quit, where in this whole scenario, the main message in this film is telegraphed. Ratings pay, and bugger who gets in the way. I found young lass, Dunaway, as someone, I don't I'd particularly like in the real world, but the movie is the real world, with a great script and acting, as well as that memorable movie's favorite line. The whole great movie plays out beautifully with an impactful and shocking climax, you first question, how. But when thinking about it, as in reality, it's not far from what really would happen, and that's the scariest thing about this movie. Watch for a young Two And A Half Men, female favorite.

73,Vartiainen,"A generation ruined, allegedly",7,11 January 2019,"An aging news anchor hears he's about to be fired. Having lost his mental balance, he informs his audience that he will shoot himself in live broadcast some days later. Surprise surprise, this nets him enormous popularity, making him the biggest hit the channel has seen in years. The greedy manager of the channel starts to exploit this for his own gains, giving the man his own show to rant and rave, mouth in froth, as much as he pleases. And the viewer numbers keep rising. But at what price?If it isn't clear already, this film is a satire. It takes a hard stance against the growing TV phenomenon of the 70s, peeling away layer after layer of filth, misinformation and bad habits.And I have to admit that it does it very eloquently. It's a wordy movie, famous for its long-winded speeches, in which no mercy is given, no prisoners are taken and no hits are pulled. These are some amazing monologues, delivered by some of the most talented actors of the decade. I salute such skill with the spoken word.Although, it is peculiar how little things have changed. This movie is over forty years old now, but even today the latest generation has been raised by television and media in general. They care about nothing, value nothing, know nothing, and can barely interact with real, living people. No one even plays outside anymore, can you believe it.Sound familiar?So, is the movie prophetic? Or is it that the older generation will always find something to complain about when the new generation won't do as they say, intent on doing things differently.Still, if you have to complain about the ruin of the next generation, at least this movie does it with style and panache. Kudos, I say. Kudos indeed.",Network
74,elshikh4,"Warns about the traps, while falling into others !",9,28 September 2010,"A different movie from Hollywood, where - for instance - there isn't an attractive lead with hot name, instead there are 2 old stars having great roles, and delivering the performance of their lifetime. Then, it's a movie to make you think, and such an important one too in that area. It exposes the new ideology of the TV in the age of no nations, only corporations, that want to get money only, and so long for anything else. And it says, so extremely bold and insightful, such a testimony about the falsity of TV through the speech of ""We lie, and you're the truth""!. I loved extra points like using the voice who speaks rightly as a merchandise, until it speaks against the higher powers. Or how these corporations themselves became the higher powers and the new god! This is rare to be seen in mainstream American movie before, and sometime after!, however it doesn't lack problems, some problems.The second part of the movie, starting from the decision of (William Holden)'s character to live with his mistress, wasn't as well and true as the first. The dialogue between him and his wife, concerning his new love, transformed into farce at the end; the consciousness of the writer was too wide-awake more than enough. I think nobody ever talks this way. Speaking of which, the last conversations between (Holden) and that very mistress (Faye Dunaway), like the speech of ""You're the TV!"", suffered from the same problem; it's so compositional and abstract to be said by humans, even if so educated ones, and sure it served the movie's message more than its credibility's strength, or contact with reality.Then, another problem with reality, well, major one this time, related with the ending; it is a complete fantasy, in which it just demolishes big part of what was before it, destroying the movie's credibility utterly, and for the same reason: a rigid consciousness beating the usual narrative for the sake of pure warning enlightenment, NOT effective drama; which's in my viewpoint the most powerful warning enlightenment ever. In that ending, the god of money (Arthur Jensen), played by (Ned Beatty), suddenly insists on putting the true show of (Howard Beale), played by (Peter Finch), on air so incomprehensibly, while (Jensen) should have known better as a businessman, and - most pressingly - as a businessman who has been stricken badly by that show short time ago! So the main executives suddenly, and so simply, approbate killing the show's host. And then, the terrorists agree to appear on live TV to kill someone, while it's certain having an execution for them later (?!).As you see, it was all on account of shocking end, not believable one at all. Even as a ""wild black satire"", which was nominated for the Golden Scroll as the best science fiction film in 1976 (while having no sci-fi factor at all!), it can't get away with it; since the drama couldn't put logic, any logic, to what happens, to end up anyhow as unconvincing.Despite being near to drowned in directness and melodrama, this is an excellent movie with unique script and sharp acting; I think it's where nobody was acting!, being one of the most significant, bitter, and - somewhat - truer movies ever made about TV, or accurately the TV state since the 1970s, having a good, so early, rank among the list of movies that hitting the books, or just hitting, the ugliness of media in modern time.

However, Sidney Lumet an equally brilliant director, took the reigns, their combined effort was nothing short of inspirational. It's a fabulous story and one suited for the age of suspicion, mistrust and social revelation. An elegant and well respected, but aging News Anchorman, Howard Beale (Peter Finch) is told he is to be fired and replaced, decides he will commit suicide on 'Live T.V.' His best friend of thirty years, Max Schumacher (William Holden) is bothered, but not surprised as he too is told by Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall) that Schumacher's sacred News Division is to be overseen by a more profit driven department. All these changes comes at the behest of the new Corporate owner Arthur Jensen (Ned Beatty) who is changing everything because he is now receiving advice from a ""Higher Power"". Taking advantage of this overall shake-up is Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway) a power hungry executive who's unscrupulous nature is matched only by her insatiable sexual appetite with anyone willing to become a stepping stone for her on her climb to the top. The movie is a superb adaption of Chayefsky's novel and with it's superior cast assures its status as a modern Classic. A Terrific Movie. ****",Network
76,freemantle_uk,I'm mad as Hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!,10,13 February 2011,"1976 was a great year for film: it was the year that saw the release of Taxi Driver, All the President's Men, Rocky, The Omen and Assault on Precinct 13. Network is amongst them and the 49th Academy Awards were one of the most tightly contested ever.The UBS network is a struggling TV company and it's News division has low rating. The anchor of the seven o'clock news, Howard Beale (Peter Finch), is sacked because of the falling rating and goes live on air to say he going to kill himself live on air in two weeks. The rating sky-rocket and Beale is given a free-reign to rant about anything he wants, but his best friend Max Schumacher (William Holden) quits when he see the company are exploiting him because of his descent into madness. Within the upper of epsilons they only care is profit and ratings, with the President of the network, Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall) and Head of Programming, Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway) leading the charge. They turn the news into a showcase for the ""Mad Prophet"" and turn into a circus. At the same time Diana starts to develop more edgy programming, include a program about revolutionary terrorist group and embarks on an affair with Max.Paddy Chayefsky writes a really clever screenplay about the battle between the management of program makers and the owners of media outlets only care about profit and ratings. Program makers want to have independence, owners care about advertisement and sponsorship. They turn news from being an important institute and public responsibility to something cheap and commercial. It is still an issue now with the idea of tabloidisation and the decline of Chinese Walls (where the editorship and ownership are meant to be separate from each other). Network would be even more poignant because the nature of television today is looking to make cheap reality shows looking for different types of people (e.g. a open homosexual and a homophobe) just so they could exploit an easy conflict. There is no intelligent in this type of TV and ownership looks for a easy profit and shock rather then quality, which Diana and Hackett represented.The acting is great, particular from Finch, Holden and Duvell. Chayefsky wrote a very witty script with great: but the actors made it even better by playing their roles absolutely seriously, they don't know they are funny. Finch is really believable as a man descending into madness and being used. He certainly did deserve an Oscar nod, but I do think Robert De Niro and Holden were very deserving to win as well. Duvell is an actor I generally really like and he was effective as a corporate man who only cares about profit. Dunaway's character is intelligent but cold character, always looking for ways to increase ratings regardless of ethics or taste, like getting a psychic to predict the news and treat news like it was entertainment.Sidney Lumet is a great director, he knows how to handle drama and made sure that Network was a fast, well pace film with no moments of boredom. He was able to mix the drama with the witty lines whilst ensuring the themes about the media are in full view. Lumet ensures that Network is a well crafted drama with comedy, a great satire.",Network

It's a savage, depressing attack on a media that has only become more exploitative.Howard Beale, as the deranged news reader who sees the Nielsen ratings soar, was one of a kind in 1975. In the new millennium we all have the potential to become him, so adept are those in control at honing in on the marketable aspects of our lives. The cameras are always there, on all of us, waiting for the (inevitable?) moment when we turn into nutcases and make someone else rich.The material about the terrorist group is less convincing, but I love the way the movie handles Beale's murder, cutting to commercial, cutting to commercial, cutting to commercial, and then a garble of voices pronouncing whatever you saw happen. Beale may have been the first (was he?) but the media can swallow everyone like this, right after your fifteenth second (not minute) of fame.Will you be next?",Network
78,ackstasis,"""What sort of script do you think we can make out of this?""",8,23 May 2008,"Perhaps it was a poor idea, prior to watching the film, to mentally link 'Network (1976)' with Alan J. Pakula's true story of newspaper journalism, 'All the President's Men (1976).' Whereas the latter is an absorbing dissection of the go-getters behind the written media, Lumet's film would probably feel more at home alongside 'Dr. Strangelove (1964),' an intelligent satire that occasionally oversteps the line of credibility, but, because we've gone with it this far, we're quite willing to take those few extra steps. The film is a stern indictment of the unscrupulous executives behind television, and also society's own obsession with mindless entertainment. Diana Christensen and Frank Hackett may very well be miserly, immoral reptiles, but it is ultimately their viewers, us, who drive their crooked dealings. Lumet delicately places the blame on his audience; we are the ""ratings"" for which the networks hunger so fanatically, and it is the crumbling state of our own culture that fuels absurd endeavours like ""The Howard Beale Show"" {thirty years on, I think we can all agree that things have only gotten worse}.A perfect example of the film's style of satire can be found early on, after veteran news anchorman Howard Beale (Peter Finch) learns that he is to be fired in two weeks' time, on account of poor ratings. The following evening, Beale calmly announces to millions of Americans his intentions to commit suicide on the air in a week's time. The show's technicians idly go about their duties, oblivious to what their star has just proclaimed, before one employee tentatively ventures, ""uh, did you hear what Howard just said?"" The network, in their ongoing quest for high ratings, was so blindly obsessed with perfecting all their technical aspects that the mental-derangement of their leading anchorman went almost completely unnoticed. At first, there is an attempt to yank Beale from the air, but one forward-thinking producer, Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway), proposes that the network could double their current ratings by keeping him in the spotlight.Peter Finch, who was awarded a posthumous Best Actor Oscar for his performance, is simply explosive as the unhinged anchorman whose volatile outbursts of derangement are celebrated by a society which, in a better world, should be trying to help him. Beale's memorable catch-cry  ""I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!""  symbolises his revulsion towards the crumbling values of today's society, and, as fanatical as he might be, most of his raves are worryingly close to the truth. William Holden is also excellent as Max Schumacher, Beale's long-time colleague, who resents the networks' treatment of his friend, but does little to interfere. Schumacher's adulterous relationship with the seductive but soulless Diana (Dunaway) consciously follows the conventional path of a television soap opera, ending with the realisation that his affair with the ratings-obsessed mistress is sapping him of any real emotion or humanity; in Schumacher's own words, ""after living with you for six months, I'm turning into one of your scripts.""

And we can also say that television is purely about ratings, who can get the highest ratings and how many will tune in? Sidney Lumet's eerily prophetic 1976 hit ""Network"" is about the lunacy of the world of television and mass-media, and those behind-the-scenes doing the programming. With top-notch performances from every big-name performer involved, things get rolling when long-time UBC anchor Howard Beale (the late Peter Finch, who received a posthumous Oscar for Best Actor) soon learns from the top brass that he is being fired due to low ratings. On his next broadcast for the network, he announces that in one week he will be committing public suicide live. Rather than have him pulled off the air, the top executives in charge decide to let him stay on the air, and his on-air rants soon become legendary and an instant ratings success. Behind-the-scenes, Beale's best friend Max Schumacher (William Holden) engages in an illicit affair with the unscrupulous program manager Diane Christianson (Best Actress Oscar-winner Faye Dunaway) who will do anything it takes to keep Beale on the air.

It's premise is that the reporting of news and entertainment become so intertwined that you really can't tell one from the other.In the weird world of ""Reality TV"", the ""Mao Tse-tung"" Hour seems relatively tame. Network is a parody that was passed up by the ludicrousness of reality. Howard Beale comes off as relatively sedate compared to the ranting of O'Reilly and Olberman.

It begins reasonably enough, with the greedy executives of the aptly titled UBS Network deciding to exploit a mentally troubled anchorman's ad-libbing of expletives and threats of on-camera suicide by promoting him as 'The Mad Prophet of the Airwaves'. After that the film becomes a wild fantasy of program planning run haywire, with the tube turning into an asylum for soothsayers, terrorists, and other assorted lunatics. Unfortunately, the outrageousness of the scenario makes it difficult to take seriously, and the timely warning of media manipulation soon degenerates into a series of shrill tirades by man-of-reason William Holden and mad-as-hell prophet Peter Finch.

The 1976 indictment of television and its quest for ratings at any cost seems to have accurately predicted what became of network news here in this century. Viewed as an absurdest depiction in its day of a media and society gone shameless we now actually live in one that celebrates it, courtesy of the plug in drug. Networks now take sides, Fox on the Right, MSNBC on the Left. They believe a more perky personality (Katie Couric) will make bad news more palatable. They spend endless hours on dead blonds and self destructive bimbos. They give the people what they want. Network lays this all out in a comically sardonic film that eviscerates a media whose lost its dignity and sense of purpose.Paddy Chayefsky's script bristles with sharp wit and biting dialogue that is delivered by a cast giving career performances. Peter Finch clearly steals the show as the messianic news anchor Howard Beale. His ""mad as hell"" speech is one of the greatest in all of film but Faye Dunaway, Ned Beatty and William Holden, in his last excellent role, give superb performances as well.

Best of all is of course Peter Finch (who sadly was awarded it posthumously in 1977); he comes across exactly like a man possessed by some higher power in his own mind. There's a tinge of the theatrical about him, but in a way that suits the milieu of TV as described as ""showbiz"" by Diana. Faye Dunaway's Diana herself is perhaps the finest work by this actress. She seems to be on some eternal personal brainstorm of morally bankrupt but inspired ratings-seeking ideas forever restlessly bubbling to the surface. While William Holden's performance as Max initially seems sidelined by these two grand standers, he later comes into his own, bringing with him a rich seam of old-fashioned humanity and humility to the ever-expanding circus.Network, made some 40 decades ago, remains a model of bold, outrageous satirical comedy, with sterling work by one of the strongest dramatic ensembles in the history of film. The bravura, Oscar-winning performance of Peter Finch alone - at once funny, frightening and haunting - makes the movie must-see viewing.Network is the last film to date to receive five nominations for acting Oscars.It is one of only two films in history to win three acting Oscars (awarded to Peter Finch, Faye Dunaway and Beatrice Straight). The other is A Streetcar Named Desire (1951).Peter Finch was the first person to win an acting Oscar posthumously, and remains the only one to win in the lead category.This was the first film since Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?

85,Lechuguilla,"""The World Is A Business, Mr. Beale""",9,28 July 2009,"In 1976 when this film came out, there was no cable television, no internet, no cell phones. All that existed, apart from newspapers and radio, were three or four ""broadcast"" television channels. Since then, technology has exploded with a cornucopia of communication devices. Which renders the story in ""Network"" painfully dated. And yet ...The story's theme is as valid now as it was thirty-three years ago. The theme is that the ratings business has corrupted television, because ad revenue, and therefore profit, is tied to the ratings. Programs and events then, and now, get aired if, and only if, they are likely to result in high ratings. It's all very seamy, very dishonorable, very shabby, and very relevant to today's world of ten thousand channels.Though most of the characters in ""Network"" end up being corrupted by television, Howard Beale (Peter Finch) is one who does not. His vision is pure. And he speaks the truth: ""... television is an ... amusement park ... a circus, a carnival, a traveling troupe of ... story tellers ... jugglers, sideshow freaks ... and football players ... You're never going to get any truth from us (television) ... We lie like hell ... We deal in illusions, none of it is true. But you people ... believe the illusions ... You do whatever the tube tells you ... you even think like the tube"". Worse yet, people elect their leaders based on how they look and sound, and how their words are interpreted by boob tube ""pundits"".""Network"" is a film wherein thematic import is conveyed almost entirely through dialogue. Some of the dialogue devolves into speechifying, which may come across to viewers as preachy. Still, the film's message was highly prophetic. Except for the film's climax, everything predicted in this film has already happened. And credit should go to script writer Paddy Chayefsky for his futuristic vision.Some parts of the film seem superfluous in retrospect, like the romance between two main characters. But the film has a sense of realism, helped along by the use of technical jargon and a general absence of background music. The film's technical elements, including direction, casting, acting, editing, and cinematography, are fine.As social commentary, ""Network"" is one of the best films ever made, despite a dated, time-bound, story. That ""there are no nations, only currency"" is becoming increasingly obvious, and as Ned Beatty's arrogant character explains in a frighteningly ominous tone: ""The world is a business, Mr. Beale"".",Network

We catch Max in mid-sentence, as he tells Howard a story about his early career with the punchline: ""You have your whole life ahead of you."" Afterward, Howard suggests killing himself on-air. Why not, replies Max? You'd get a fifty share, easy. So of course Howard goes on air the next evening saying exactly that.I wish I loved the rest of the movie as much as I do that opening. ""Network"" is a brilliant film more in concept than in execution.What people know best about ""Network"" is Peter Finch as Beale. As the film progresses, he becomes ""the mad prophet of the airwaves,"" shrieking various profundities for the sake of salvaging the ratings of his fourth-place network, UBS. Wearing a raincoat and pajamas, he tells his audience to not just get mad, but mad as hell. ""I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore,"" he tells his audience to yell out the windows, and many do, to the satisfaction of programmer Diane Christensen (Faye Dunaway), who grabs the show and makes it her own.Holden and Finch are brilliant as tired newsmen who throw up their hands at the machinations of their fellow men, in part because they take their roles with a certain grain of salt. ""I was married for 33 years to shrill, shrieking fraud,"" Beale announces on the air at one point, as if his audience would view his failed marriage as an example of their own sad existence. Finch really straddles the line between satire and drama, while Max's drunken musings about ""the death hour,"" his own face a deathlike shroud, is startling in its delivery, never mind his comment after about Disney.Less successful are Robert Duvall as a ""hatchet-man"" for UBS's parent corporation and Ned Beatty as the head of that parent corporation, both of whom are way too shrill even for the excessive roles they are assigned. Dunaway is a fine actress who won an Oscar for her performance here, but I can't decide whether she's part of the problem or not. When Christensen goes to visit Hackett early in the film, urging Beale be kept on the air, Dunaway is alternately annoying and brilliant when she makes her case. Half the time she gives a breast-clenching display of actorliness, half the time she is subtle and believable, like when Duvall demands whether she is serious about putting the mad Beale back on the air and she simply nods yes.Ultimately, screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky is the problem. He had the concept, a lovely one, but his execution is verbose and excessive. He makes Jonathan Swift seem light. ""A strip Savonarola inveighing against the hypocrisies of our times that will just go through the roof!"" Who talks like that? Not any television executive, not even on PBS.Beale's subsequent success as a television prophet defies believability. People who claim Chayefsky saw television's future kid themselves. Even Bill O'Reilly doesn't attack religious belief or else claim he is ""imbued,"" the way Beale does. The way he is embraced by his audience cries out ""plot convenience"" as does the relationship between Max and Diane, especially near the end when Max dresses down Diane for her television stereotyping of their relationship. It's annoyingly convenient how Holden's character gets to have his roll in the hay with Dunaway's Christensen, then take the high moral road. Frankly, Max became a lot less palatable embarking on his affair not once but twice, and after Diane did him out of his job, too. I think Beatrice Straight as Max's wife won her Oscar simply because so many of the Academy voters choked on Max's holier-than-thou hubris, and appreciated the fact someone in the movie gave it back to him.But did Straight have to use terms like ""emeritus years"" and ""dotage""? The problem isn't that Chayefsky talked like that, but that he made his characters do likewise.""Network"" is satire that is neither funny nor believable, featuring characters neither human nor empathetic, and dialogue that seems pulled from a thesaurus.

88,EUyeshima,Prophetic Chayefsky-Lumet Masterwork Accurately Foresees the Profit-Motivated Madness of Television,10,18 April 2006,"With the primacy of reality programming on current primetime TV schedules and the fight for ratings even more virulent with the dismantling of the networks, the vitriol and perceptiveness of Paddy Chayefsky's screenplay for this searing satire resonates today more than ever. What gives the prophetic movie its power is how the story never veers that far from the truth, even in 1976 when the film was originally released. In fact, what may have seemed excessive back then has mostly come true, and that's the beauty of reintroducing this modern classic in a bountiful two-disc DVD package in 2006.Set in the fictitious offices of the ratings cellar-dwelling UBS network, the multi-layered story initially focuses on Howard Beale, the aging anchorman of the evening news. About to be fired and in a state of dementia, he announces on the air that he is going to commit suicide. Veteran UBS news director Max Schumacher, Beale's longtime friend and colleague, is called in to convince Beale to retract his statement. Instead, Beale goes on a rampage about the nauseating decline of American society. Ratings skyrocket, and up-and-coming programming executive Diana Christensen wants to take control of Beale's show and turn it into an outrageous infotainment show with Beale as the ""Mad Prophet of the Airwaves"". Schumacher and Christensen are at odds professionally but not before entering into a torrid affair which has him leaving his patient wife. The novelty of both the program and the affair, however, eventually wears off, and ratings plummet leading to drastic measures that the network decides to take.Director Sidney Lumet certainly knows how to tell a virulent story that teeters precariously between reality and satire and uses Lee Richardson's appropriately stentorian voice-over as the perfect chorus. Lumet also gets superb performances out of a powerful ensemble starting with Peter Finch who captures the visceral rage and psychological decline of Beale in accurate detail. It's a showy role with little introspection shared about his elliptical character, but he makes it work for the viewer. In what turned out to be the best of his late career performances, William Holden guides the only moral conscience the network seems to have, even as he gives into the temptations of a younger woman who only lives for and through television.Ideally cast, Faye Dunaway uses her cool, collected beauty to great advantage here. What's more, with barely a hint of humanity, she pierces with the sheer venom of Christensen's unapologetically Machiavellian strategies. She has a willing partner in Frank Hackett, the ratings-hungry head of UBS, played with malevolently energetic force by Robert Duvall. In smaller roles that amount to vividly etched cameos, Ned Beatty brings out Shakepearean-level bluster as corporate bigwig Arthur Jensen preaching to Beale on the power of the almighty buck; Marlene Warfield is all anger and commercial savvy as the Angela Davis doppelganger revolutionary Laureen Hobbs; and Beatrice Straight is superb as Schumacher's betrayed wife moving from fury to resignation with aching desperation. Even though the film has the visual look of a television show, it is a true masterwork driven by Chayefsky's brilliant script.The DVD package contains Lumet's expert commentary on the first disc. The second disc has an 85-minute, six-chapter documentary produced specifically for the DVD, ""The Making of Network"", which includes participation from among others, Lumet, Dunaway, Beatty, producer Howard Gottfried and Walter Cronkite's daughter Kathy (who had a bit part as a Patty Hearst-like character in the movie). Produced by Laurent Bouzereau, who did similar duties on the recently released DVD of David Lean's ""Ryan's Daughter"", it is chockfull of interesting information about the production and a fascinating historical perspective by Cronkite himself.In addition, there is an odd curio, an appearance by Chayefsky on Dinah Shore's daytime talk show when the film was released. He lends intriguing insight into his screenplay, his perspective on television and what he feels the movie is all about, even though Shore and guest Steve Lawrence are intrusively banal with their interjectory comments (Shore's other guest Anne Bancroft has the good sense to keep her mouth shut when Chayefsky talks). The last piece is a career retrospective interview with Lumet on Robert Osborne's ""Private Screenings"" series on Turner Movie Classics. While Lumet's film-making career is impressive, Osborne's rather celebratory questioning really doesn't lend much insight beyond a recital of Lumet's laudatory accomplishments.",Network
89,Steffi_P,"""Let him do his angry man thing""",4,12 August 2010,"One thing you got in 70s cinema, as the 60s generation began to grow up and relaxations on content stopped being threatening and started being normal, was that the message movie went mainstream. Understandably, the eloquence of the message was always going to be more important than its real importance.Network was scripted by Paddy Chayefsky, who was less the angry young man of the anti-Vietnam generation, and more the grumpy middle-aged man of any and every generation. Appropriately enough the picture is a cynical and grouchy rant. It is preachy, hysterically so in places, and yet it is so pessimistic, offering no solutions to the problems it builds up to ridiculous proportions, that watching it is a rather draining experience. Its message is not as clever as it thinks it is, conflating a new technology with ongoing social problems, as short-sighted cynics have done for centuries. There is even a none-too-subtle dig at women who take on masculine roles, which just goes to show how bitter and reactionary Network is. And the idea of someone so obsessed with an idea it causes them orgasm prematurely is simple a sad mix of bad psychology and playground puerility.And yet, the 70s were also a time in which Hollywood was starting to regain some semblance of professionalism, after the unevenness of the previous decade. Network seems to have been made by a highly consistent production team. Sets and costumes are designed to perpetuate a pattern of regular black and white shapes arranged in rows. Not just ceiling lights or skyscraper windows, but filing cabinets, radiators all conform to this same style. Director Sidney Lumet, with his usual mode of subtle stylisation, even keeps it up in the few outdoor daytime, with the even framing of the tree-lined boulevard in the scene after Ruddy's funeral. Lumet also often has opposing shots of two actors with one in bright white and the other in black, so the switching back-and-forth between them is like a light flicking on and off.The 70s was also a time in which acting really started to successfully reconcile dramatic realism with theatrical exuberance, and here we have some great examples of both. William Holden, looking decidedly weary and craggy, seems to have entered the age which suits his style best, and he brings a layer of genuine humanity which Network sorely needs. Beatrice Straight gives a small yet impassioned performance as his wife, and though barely five minutes long her performance is among the more memorable. Another excellent bit performance is that of Ned Beatty, whose glorious hamming is the complete opposite of Straight's straightness, but nevertheless provides one of the most entertaining scenes of the whole picture. Of course any more than a few minutes of screen time and these two performances would unbalance the entire thing. Which brings us onto Peter Finch, who again is pure ham, but of the classic Charles Laughton variety, putting every ounce of strength he has into a compelling act. Had it not been Lumet's policy to ensure the real-world cinema screen never becomes the same as the film-world TV screen, we in the audience would be truly mesmerised by those mad prophet speeches.And thus Network delivers its message with great force and power. And of course the film has now gained a new raft of fans because this banal grumble about TV was supposedly ""ahead of its time"", except that TV never has been and never will be quite that way, because audiences – human beings – are not as stupid as Chayefsky thinks they are. In fact, the thing that Network probably best predicts is the wave of movies like Fight Club that didn't really say much but said it with an original twist and thus became cult hits. Which is a pity. And now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to watch the new series of X-Factor, which though lowbrow at least makes good entertainment.",Network

At first no one really hears what he has to say, but this provides the reason that he can stay on television. We see how far a network, or the moneymakers behind the network, wants to go to make that money, to get people watching. Those people involve Howard's friend played by William Holden, Holden's sort of mistress played by Faye Dunaway and Robert Duvall as the man with the strings.The story itself sometimes goes a little too far, although in a time like this, may years after the film was made, we are not really sure. The ending seems almost inevitable on one hand, on the other hand it seems a little exaggerated. May be the exaggerations are good here just to show very clearly how far people are willing to go. It goes over the top the way a movie as 'Wag the Dog' goes over the top. It does this for a reason and succeeds in what it wants to say.The performances are memorable, Peter Finch's the most of all. His way of playing a man who seems very bright and very mad at the same time is terrific. 'Network' has its flaws, but it works so well we are willing to forgive them.",Network
91,nycritic,The Age of Network,10,22 February 2005,"Thirty years after its release to public praise and multiple Oscar wins, Network is one of those films that instead of dating badly or becoming a product of its time has actually grown and become even more relevant today, and if it were re-released in 2006 for its actual thirtieth anniversary not on film but on national television right at the beginning of the fall season (complete with the most lurid reality TV shows and inane TV pleasers), it would only become more justified in its story.The story of the failing network that didn't have a show on the Nielsen Top 20 and resorted to extreme measures to ensure that this changed seems so today: we see how channels that once had failing ratings churned out shock television right smack in the daytime while still applying Standard and Practices to other ""prime-time"" shows that could be taken the ""wrong"" way. Jerry Springer, Maury Povich, Rikki Lake, Oprah, Mark Burnett, MTV -- they're all here under different guises, all competing to have their voices heard on television, all eventually becoming as ratings-hungry and establishment-friendly as the CEOs running the show.Today we don't quite have Howard Beales ranting and raving about the ills of society on national TV (although they do ""tell"" us how we should feel, when we should laugh if we're too stupid to get the joke, who to vote for, the ""truth"" about the tobacco industry). Today media is all the rage and televises even a fart if it deems it interesting and guarantees more viewers. Today shows like ""20/20"" or ""60 Minutes"" bring us 'exclusives' even if it's at the cost of journalistic integrity. And now, with 'reality TV' still the dominating novel trend even in little-seen cable channels, creating stereotypes in leaps and bounds while claiming authenticity of the events depicted, there hasn't yet been a need to create a lunatic who could sermonize everything and make us Mad as Hell. On this aspect alone NETWORK has dated: the 70s were all about counterculture, anti-establishment, revolution, leftists, Patty Hearsts, Lennon and Yoko, ""Nova"", the Mansons, the hippies, the Earth-lovers, the militants. Nowadays, buff bodies parade themselves in shows containing outlandish competitions where eating the most grotesque concoctions are the norm, or enduring a barrage of extreme insults has become entertainment (i. e. ""American Idol"") and the very concept of dignity flies out the window. Of course, after signing an extensive release form in which they free the network of all responsibilities if something goes wrong because we all know networks can't be held liable for any faux pas. In short, nowadays people from all over try to become the next It person and outlast their 15 minutes of fame. Nowadays, everyone has their own reality TV show depicting their 24 hour day activities. I wonder if Diana Christensen isn't alive and well and exerting absolute control over the networks in general, bringing anything and everything that can garner a little bit of shock value (Boy Meets Boy, or any reality TV self-made ""villain/villainess"") and eventual ratings, taking over actual scripted shows with real actors.NETWORK is a powerful movie of which I can't praise enough about even if its screenplay, by Paddy Chayefsky is a little too verbose. No one talks the way he makes his characters talk, using impassioned speeches with big, even archaic, words, and more than once the script makes the characters go completely over the top but even then it makes its point. Of the actors, William Holden's quiet portrayal of a former television exec, Max Schumacher, who has a conscience, but still feels some attraction to danger and risks his own family to experience is who is at the heart of this crazy story who was ahead of its time. Peter Finch's Howard Beale never comes through enough as a real human being: just someone who was pushed too hard and decided to shut down for the remainder of his life. But Holden holds the moral glue of the story, and interestingly enough, is wise to know that his affair, perfectly scripted as he even states, will end on a high note -- he'll return to his sanity and his wife, and Diana Christensen will bask in her own executive madness, since this is all she knows and holds dear. In her last words -- ""Let's kill the son of a bitch."" -- she informs us this is all she is about without so much as batting an eye. Who comes, who goes, is irrelevant to her, as long as the network can be number one. And that is the inhuman reality of television -- a media directed to entertain humans.",Network

Network is ahead of its time in showing all of this. Funny enough the ravings of Howard Beale who many consider crazy turn out to be truths, he's the most honest character in the film. The end of this film shows that nothing is above prime ratings, even murder. It was almost normalised. Great performances from a strong cast. The content and messaging is top notch.

I understand how the two aspects reflect each other and converge near the end to reinforce the point of the movie, but that doesn't change the fact that it gave me the feeling that Network was slightly uneven. Still, this movie is worth watching for a variety of reasons, including great performances by Peter Finch and Faye Dunaway, some excellent writing, and its commentary on television that's more relevant today than ever.",Network

UBS fires him after this incident, but Schumacher intervenes so that Beale can have a dignified farewell. Beale promises he will apologize for his outburst, but once on the air, he launches back into a rant claiming that life is ""bullshit."" Beale's outburst causes the newscast's ratings to spike, and much to Schumacher's dismay, the upper echelons of UBS decide to exploit Beale's antics rather than pull him off the air.

98,Cosmoeticadotcom,Great satire,8,15 September 2008,"Film director Sidney Lumet is, with the possible exception of Robert Wise, the most underrated director in Hollywood history. When one looks at the list of great films in Lumet's career: 12 Angry Men, Long Day's Journey Into Night, Fail-Safe, Serpico, Murder On The Orient Express, Dog Day Afternoon, and a handful of others, one marvels, not only at what he accomplished, but that he's spent a quarter-century having churned out nothing but mediocrity since 1982's The Verdict. Yet, of all the films in his canon, perhaps the best, and certainly the most complex, was 1976's Network- the greatest black comedy this side of Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, Or: How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love the Bomb. It was to corporate America what Strangelove was to the military industrial complex.Written by the nonpareil Paddy Chayefsky, Network is not only a prescient film, but still a cogent one, as remarkable as that claim seems. Whereas many films from the years in between its release and now have dated badly, the same cannot be said of Network. Like other visionary films, from Metropolis to The Trial, Network not only crafted a world unto itself, but a world that, in large part, has seen its day realize. Yes, there are no PC's on the desks of the network stooges, but other than that, the depiction of corporate America's deadly vapidity, its whoring of life and death and war and suffering into mere commodities, has all come true. Reality TV has shown that the only thing that Chayefsky's and Lumet's film has not yet seen come true is the assassination on live television that closes the film. This oddly vatic quality raises the question of whether the film can even rightly be called a satire. Perhaps a prophecy is closer to the mark, especially in how the fictive fourth network, UBS (Union Broadcasting Systems), so closely resembles the real current fourth network, then a decade from its creation, FOX.The tale is one that seems not so outlandish any longer- Howard Beale (Peter Finch), widowed, depressed, and alcoholic network news anchorman for the UBS Evening News, has learnt that he will be fired due to low ratings. Beale's producer and friend, Max Schumacher (William Holden) informs him of this, and this seems to be the final straw for Beale, who glibly announces his impending retirement, and that he will also suicide on next week's show. Few techs in the studio are even paying attention until one of them who was freaks out. Network bigwigs freak out, yet there is never a sense of real overacting- save, perhaps for Finch's role. This is why the film is so devastating, for Chayefsky and Lumet were intimately involved with network politics from the earliest days of television, and drew from their decades of experience to couch craziness in acceptability. If Network is not a great film it is certainly, as Lumet mantras in his commentary, a prescient one. It is also proof that, despite what naysayers and masturbatory French cineastes might think, film is a writer's medium, first and foremost, not a visual one, for Network shows that greatness is possible sans special effects and virtually no music- the film is void of a formal score. This lack, however, only heightens the realistic acidity of Chayefsky's brilliant and funny words, which transcend satire and enter reportage, at times. Just watch the scene where Schumacher finally leaves Christensen, and ask yourself how much more powerful is that scene without a swelling musical crescendo, not to mention Chayefsky's having Holden narrate his own exit, stage right? Go ahead, try to name me a film that reaches greatness in the other direction- with just special effects and music, and no screenplay of merit. Lo!I recommend especially anyone under the age of thirty-five to watch this film, and they will see just how predictable the current lowest common denominator state of affairs, domestically and abroad, in the media and in day to day affairs, was, even decades in coming. This is because the core of a society's problems never lie with its leaders nor its media, but with its citizens. This has played out not only internationally, with the rise of terrorism, but domestically, with the mute acceptance of corruption and civil rights infringements by the scared masses, as well as a refusal by the general electorate to refuse to vote for crooks and bums for elective office. Thus, the fictive raving idiots that shouted their madness, along with Howard Beale, back then are now railing in reality, on cable TV and in the blogosphere, now. And still no one is worried, and there's no Chayefsky around to skewer the idiocy. Network exemplified what made the 1970s the last great era in American film- great writing, acting, and a deeper sense of what the art could do. Let's hope that last era is not the final one, as well.",Network
99,bobsgrock,Timeless and universal.,9,18 September 2008,"Network is a film of very rare proportions. It was released over thirty years ago, yet despite all the changes that have come into the world over the years, there is still a place for it in the annals of American history. The story is that of a fictional television network that is sinking deeper and deeper in the fight for ratings. Realizing he is going to be fired soon, veteran news anchor Howard Beale, in a remarkable performance by Peter Finch, goes on the air and announces he will commit suicide on his last broadcast. Both shocked and excited at this once in a lifetime opportunity, the VP of Programming (Faye Dunaway) and an executive of the network (Robert Duvall) decide to exploit this and use it to boost ratings.With a story of this magnitude and intensity, the acting must be top-notch in order to give a feel of realism. Every single acting bit is incredibly well-done. Finch, Dunaway, and Beatrice Straight all won Oscars for their roles, and the cast also includes great performances by Duvall, William Holden, among many others. The script by Paddy Chayefsky is brilliantly satiric as well as realistic in its portrayal of television as a hollow, influential medium that can alter the mass majority of people's views. Some of the great scenes are Howard Beale spilling on live television his true feelings about the medium and how it has corrupted a whole generation, and you can see Chayefsky just having fun with writing a monologue like that. Sidney Lumet directs with solid steadiness and the entire movie works as a satire on television and a relevant look at the effects of it. See this movie if for no other reason but to understand what television has become.",Network
100,mattymatt4ever,"Stagey and longish, but altogether well-made and beautifully acted",7,10 March 2002,"""Network"" is directed by Sidney Lumet, who's known for making deep, moving dramas with well-written stories, but doesn't contribute much style to his direction.  The film often plays out like a stage play, driven mainly by dialogue and monologues.  Don't get me wrong, there is some very good, witty dialogue and monologues, including one which occurs in the scene where William Holden breaks up with Faye Dunaway, who he loves deeply, yet can't share much intimacy, because her life is trivialized by the network she has worked for so many years and caused her to become a slave to the airways. But the dialogue drags down the pace, and so does the overlength. 
The acting is the best incentive to check out this slightly overrated satire.  William Holden, who I haven't seen previous to this movie, delivered a fine, subtle performance.  Peter Finch is of course the cream of the crop.  I don't know much about Finch, so I checked out his biography before submitting this comment.  It was sad to find out that he died a year after the film's release and months before he was awarded an Oscar for his performance.  In the movie, he plays a hyper, overworked individual who gets so wound up he sometimes passes out from exhaustion.  I thought that was just part of his character.  Well, Finch gave a memorable performance in which he shouted out his trademark line ""I'm mad as hell, and I'm not gonna take this anymore!!!!""  Faye Dunaway is beautiful and highly convincing in a colorful role as a TV exec who will do absolutely anything to get close to a 50 share in the Nielsen ratings.  Robert Duvall is also great.  It's funny to see that even thirty years ago he had hardly a shred of hair on his scalp.  I would recommend ""Network,"" though not highly.  I probably won't watch it on repeat viewings, it's not a very entertaining movie to watch, but it's well-written and nicely satirizes the television industry without being too overstated.

101,hall895,Brilliant and prescient,8,3 December 2012,"Look at the cesspool that is modern television. Who could have ever foreseen this? Screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky and director Sidney Lumet could. Way back in 1976 they produced a film which in addition to being a simply brilliant satire also served as a preview of our modern media world. Anything goes in the quest for an extra point or two in the ratings. You watch Network and you think maybe Chayefsky and Lumet pushed it a little too far, that by film's end they had gone past the point of believability. But did they really? Would what was so shocking in 1976 really be shocking at all today? Can anything really shock us anymore? Something to think about when watching the film. Or, if you don't really want to think about things like that, you can just sit back and enjoy the film. If all you want are laughs Network works on that level too. It really is a near-perfect combination of humor and smarts. Network gives you your laughs. But it gives you a brilliant story too.So Howard Beale is mad as hell and he's not going to take this anymore. That's what everybody seems to remember most about Network. Understandable as the character is so memorable and the performance from Peter Finch so unquestionably superb. But this film has so much more to offer. Just look at the cast list. William Holden, Robert Duvall, Faye Dunaway, Ned Beatty. Magnificent performances from all of them and solid support from a host of others as well. Heck, the acting in this film is so good Beatrice Straight got an Oscar for about five minutes of work. Terrific actors working from a marvelous Chayefsky script, all guided by the eminently capable hands of Lumet. Put all that together and it is no wonder Network turned out so wonderfully.At its beginning the film appears to be about Howard Beale, the old news anchor about to be fired who rather than go quietly into the night announces his plans to kill himself on-air. This proves to be quite the ratings boost so Beale is kept on the air. The further he goes down the path to madness the bigger a hit this mad prophet of the airwaves becomes. Thrilled about this is programming executive Diana Christensen, a woman laser-focused on her career and the quest for better ratings for the network. To her Howard Beale is a godsend. Howard's old friend, news division head Max Schumacher, on the other hand considers this obvious exploitation of a clearly insane man to be a tragedy. The professional conflict between Diana and Max leads to a personal relationship between the two. But is the emotionless, soulless Diana even capable of being in a relationship? Some of the movie's best moments come in the push and pull between Diana and Max, played perfectly by Dunaway and Holden. The higher-ups at the network, personified most clearly by Duvall's Frank Hackett, make it clear whose side they're on in the Diana-Max kerfuffle over Howard. Money talks and Howard Beale is making them money. This network will do anything for money. Absolutely anything to protect the bottom line. Including getting in bed with terrorists...which may prove useful later.There's a sense the film goes off the rails a bit towards the end but if it does it does so willfully and gleefully. Chayefsky and Lumet had a statement they wanted to make and boy does that statement still hit home all these years later. What a story, what performances. Genuine laughs and genuine heart. Everything works. Finch, Holden, Dunaway and Duvall are the four big stars with the meatiest parts and they're all fabulous. But you can't discount the smaller performances either, Straight earning that Oscar with such raw emotion as Max's aggrieved wife. And Beatty with one of the all-time great movie speeches which isn't even the greatest speech in this film thanks to Finch's mad as hell moment. Network has, in Howard Beale, one of film's all-time great characters. But the film has so much other great stuff going on that Howard becomes almost a sideshow. It's a film which is brimming with excellence. Quite brilliantly done.",Network

The film is most likely better suited as a satire concerning the television industry today than it was 30 years ago. Anything that could boost ratings is thrown in and although the script intentionally goes too far it doesn't seem too unlikely that money driven corporations would go this far to further their status.The actors are not good here, they're brilliant. Faye Dunaway is perfect as the station's television programmer who will go to any lengths to ensure good ratings (and I mean ANY). She overacts, sure, but hits precisely the right heights to create a character like no other. A heartless and manipulative bitch never looked so appealing.

103,sharky_55,We've struck the motherlode!,10,28 October 2015,"Howard Beale is the 12 year veteran anchor at USB Evening News, but ratings are tanking and he is to be fired in two weeks. Almost innocuously, he slips in his farewell message, but not to the network, but to the world. Meanwhile, the technical crew are oblivious, too focused on the many variables that need to be timed and executed to perfection, until someone pipes up. This might be an outrageous scenario to think of today, that a suicidal man is put back on air instead of receiving treatment, but Lumet's subdued approach means we only slowly realise what sort of world this is. Of course, the issue here is the hypocrisy of those anti-establishment outbursts while on a primetime show itself. This is sidestepped initially, because Beale is portrayed as the addled man taken advantage of by the network. Later, he becomes conscious of corporate meddling from far far above and must bring it down, until there must be an intervention.Imagine Lumet blocking the climatic speech in the conference room, setting up the lighting of those lamps, composing in his mind the tremendous figure of Beatty in his frame. Now imagine Jensen doing the same thing, drowning the room in darkness, purposefully setting up ornate green lamps in order to light a heavenly pathway from us (Beale) to him, rehearsing every ounce of theatricality of his monologue. A frightening performance and scene that truly announces how far the satire has come. He rises immensely from the low angle, each cut brings the two closer together, and his gestures are true marks of his sincerity. He places a divine message in the hands of Beale. The facade is broken momentarily; Beale asks in his amazement why such a tiny figure such as him should carry such a glorious message, and Jensen snaps back, ""Because you're on TV, dummy."" Because you have the cult following of millions, and they wait on your every word. Oh, this is much more dramatic than a burning bush. There are other characters of various complexities who make up the network. Paddy Chayefsky intersperses moments of genuine emotion (two friends getting drunk and reminiscing over old times, and later one shaking his head at the demise of the other) with these fast talking, quipping and literary-dense dialogue driven characters (Sorkin took a leaf, or rather an entire chapter of this book) who run the show without an ounce of emotional or real life. This is their life. Faye Dunaway is magnificent as the programming head who spots a window of opportunity and ratings within Beale (but not seeing him for what he is) and grabs it ruthlessly. There is also a long-time schoolgirl crush on a idol of hers, and here again Lumet is cinematic (at least, compared to the rest of the office and corporate settings, the blasting natural halogens), lighting them dimly to suggest the lingering sexual tension and enticing attraction of an affair. Isn't that what all late-night office scenes are for? Later they speak pointedly of this mutual attraction, and the sunlight hits Dunaway's face and bathes her in the most stunning way and she creases up in a smile, before we cut back to the dull grey office, where she is busy in her world and her mind is the furthest from romance. It would have been easy to portray her as some manipulative enchantress only looking to get ahead, but it is played straight, and it becomes amusing when she climaxes while musing on how to attain a prime-time slot for The Mao Tse-Tung Hour, and then continuing to murmur on day-time programming post-coital. Holden speaks not a word. What about the impassioned five minute appearance of Beatrice Straight as Louise Schumacher, the shortest ever Oscar winner? In such little time she constructs such a potent and emotionally devastating narrative (a script, if you will), and these words hit Max right in the gut, but in the end she relents and resolves to not give up. Chayefsky masterfully engages and then holds back. This is genuine domestic drama but with a just a sprinkle of the satirical salt. They speak literally about the outcomes of this event. They are entangled within a script for the times, and the homely art direction of the set, as Ebert notes, the worn bookcases, the lived-in kitchen, the snug couch, the cluttered wooden desk, the warm tabletop lamps. And compare that to Diana's residence which almost personifies the affair; she lives in what is basically a dusty motel. If there was ever a case for sleeping at the office, it is hers. But beyond that Network is truly prescient. These days corporations of all shapes and sizes are owned by larger corporations of all shapes and sizes. Corporate cosmology, the divine order of the world, as Jensen and Beale so preach. The higher-ups have demanded that the ecological balance must be reset, and so the ramblings becomes depressing, stark and the ratings drop. Watch how intently a business meeting is staged until they come to the question of how to retain their high ratings; ""What do you fellas say to an assassination?"" And this is slipped into a discussion of how to kick-start their next serialised program with this act. The closing shots pit the demise of man because of his low ratings against other various programs and advertisement. He is to be quickly replaced. Back then, Network was biting satire, but these days it's more of a documentary, albeit with some humorous bits. There's even a narrator to guide us through the recount.

104,jhclues,"""I Want You To Go To The Window--""",9,5 March 2001,"It's all about ratings and telling the people what they think they want to see, in Paddy Chayefsky's,`Network,' a biting satire of television and those who program the beast,  directed by Sidney Lumet and starring William Holden, Faye Dunaway and Peter Finch.  In the world of the television corporate news division of a major network, the prevailing attitude is `I don't care what you've done for me in the past, what have you done for me lately,' and so, as veteran newsman and network programmer Max Schumacher (Holden) discovers, it's out with the old and in with the new, as Diana Christensen (Dunaway) steps in with some radical ideas of how to bolster ratings, including giving a group of terrorists their own show.  But the boldest move of all comes with decision of the network hierarchy to keep anchorman Howard Beale (Finch) on the air, even after he announces (on the air) that he is going to commit suicide during the next broadcast, which of course, sends the ratings through the roof overnight. 	Working form Chayefsky's intelligent, well crafted screenplay (for which he received an Oscar), Lumet presents a scything commentary on the whys and wherefores of the decision making process behind what America watches that is hilarious in it's very absurdity; so absurd at times, in fact, that it is just too close to reality.  And though the situations in the film are exaggerated, of course, it makes you stop and consider that in many cases fact is-- in truth-- stranger than fiction.  It also makes you wonder what the 6:00 newscast you watch every night is really all about:  Is it a conveyance for information, or merely entertainment? 	To bring it all to life, Lumet assembled an extraordinary cast, many of whom give memorable performances that are the highlight of the film, beginning with Holden as the jaded newsman who, late in life, is trying to figure out how it all fits together and works.  He perfectly captures that sense of earnest futility and confusion into which Max's life has descended, and the stoic acquiescence with which he resolves it.  Dunaway, meanwhile, pulls out all the stops and turns in a dynamic performance-- her best next to her portrayal of Bonnie in `Bonnie & Clyde'-- that earned her an Oscar for Best Actress.  She skillfully brings out all of the energy and zealousness of the character, and leaves no doubt about the direction in which Diana's career is headed (that would be up!) and woe to anyone who gets in her way.  She plays it all beautifully, and through her, Diana becomes the very personification of female prowess.  And, not to be outdone by his co-stars, Finch turns in a memorable performance as the veteran anchorman at the end of his rope who adjures his viewers to go to their windows, open them and yell the now classic line, `I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!' which has such a profound effect on those watching that Beale soon becomes a so-called `prophet' of the airwaves. It's a brilliant portrayal of a man lost in despair and struggling with a loss of faith in everything he has held sacred his whole life that deservedly won him the Oscar for Best Actor. 	The supporting cast includes Beatrice Straight (Mrs. Schumacher), in the role that earned her an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, Robert Duvall (Frank Hackett), Wesley Addy (Chaney), Ned Beatty (Jensen), Arthur Burghardt (Ahmed Kahn), Bill Burrows (TV Director), John Carpenter (Bosch), Jordan Charney (Hunter) and Kathy Cronkite (Mary Ann Gifford).  There is much in this film that will strike a chord of recognition with the audience, because it concerns a medium with which practically everyone living in America today is familiar.  In the final analysis, rather than condemning television and the powers-that-be behind the programs, `Network' is more of a wake-up call-- not only to those who decide what we see, but to those who watch it-- to accept responsibility for what is being served up with impunity and ingested without question every day.  It's an entertaining, albeit caustic, film with a moral, from which no one with a conscience is exempt. I rate this one 9/10.",Network
105,johno-21,The ratings game,9,17 March 2006,"I first saw this film during it's initial theatrical release and have seen it several times since. Paddy Chayefsky's dark satirical story about a fourth place network's news department was nominated for 10 Academy Awards for 1976 and won four. It was the most nominated film cast in Academy history with five nominations for Peter Finch, William Holden, Faye Dunaway, Beatrice Straight and Ned Beatty. It tied 1951's A Streetcar Named Desire that won Oscars for Viven Leigh, Kim Hunter and Karl Malden with Oscars for Peter Finch as Best Actor, Faye Dunaway as Best Actress and Beatrice Straight as Best Supporting Actress. William Holden as Max Shumacher, the head of the network news could have likely won the second Oscar of his career had Finch not died of a heart attack two months before the Academy Awards. Finch earned his Best Actor award for his portrayal of aging news anchor Howard Beale Stage actress Beatrice Straight, who did a lot of television roles but very few film roles in her career won Best Supporting Actress in a small on screen role as Louise Shumacher, the wife of the head of the network news for her passioned emotionally drained delivery of of some of Chayefsky's best dialog in the movie. Faye Dunaway won Best Actress as Diana Christiensen, the cold calculating Vice President of Programing. Chayefsky won for Best Screenplay the third Oscar of his career. He had previously won for another black comedy, 1971's The Hospital and for the tender drama Marty in 1955 adapted from his stage play. Director Sidney Lumet made his cast go through long grueling rehearsals as if they were doing a stage play which paid off in their interpretation of Chayefsky's script. Lumet had been a master director of human emotion with such films as Long Days Journey Into Night, The Pawnbroker, Fail Safe, Dog Day Afternoon and Serpico and although nominated for Best Director he lost out to John Alvidsen for Rocky. Other nominations included Best Picture, Best Editing for Alan Heim and Best Cinematography for Owen Roizman. This film falls a little short for me but I would still give it a 9.0 out of 10 and recommend it.",Network
106,rupie,perhaps the blackest black comedy ever,8,7 January 2000,"When this movie came out in '76 I didn't bother seeing it because I rejected the premise as implausible; the very idea that a network anchor would go nuts on the air and become a hook for ratings seemed ridiculous on its face.
Would that it were so.Today we have Jerry Springer, Maury Povich, Howard Stern, etc. etc. etc. At the beginning of the movie a drunken Max Schumacher (William Holden) fantasizes about a show called ""the Death Hour"" comprised of films of car crashes, suicides, train wrecks, and so forth, to be put on Sunday night in prime time. ""It'll blow Disney outta the f------g water!"" he laughs. A few years back some network put exactly such a show - ""Eye Witness Videos"" - on the air. On Sunday night. In prime time. In short, as most everyone here has commented, ""Network""'s horrifying vision - brilliantly written by the incredibly prescient Paddy Chayevsky -  has been truly and frighteningly prophetic, and rings absolutely true today.The movie is a veritable feast of tour-de-force acting from all involved. In particular  William Holden's wrenching performance as the burned-out but still sensitive Max is drop-jaw stunning. I feel he, not Finch, should have gotten the Oscar, though Finch's work is not exactly chopped liver either. And what a brilliant device on Chayevsky's part to make the lunatic Howard Beale the only one of the bunch with clarity of vision.
That the film is intended to be a satire and a comedy is clear from the narration, especially the final comment about Beale becoming the first man to be killed because of lousy ratings. But it is without doubt the blackest black comedy ever filmed. A lasting legend of filmmaking art.",Network
107,aciessi,Mad as Hell,9,7 July 2019,"""This is the story of Howard Beale, the first known instance of a man who was killed because he had lousy ratings.""Earlier this year I saw Network on Broadway with Bryan Cranston playing Howard Beale. As a theatrical experience, It was wild and fun. But curiously, I never saw the movie it was based on. Network, the motion picture is a classic of the 1970's. A film way ahead of its time in terms of what it foresaw about the future of television and it's influence on our way of life. In 2019, unfortunately, Network is a reality. The line between entertainment and honest journalism has nearly been erased. Our television programs rival between propaganda and gratuitous debauchery. Paddy Chayefsky, like a poet, rants and raves through the many characters we see here as a word of warning to viewers in it's time. TV is going to kill us. In this instance, It killed Howard Beale.Howard Beale is a madman. Well, he was an average man who went mad after learning that the network was going to fire him. In an act of desperation, he declares that he's going to commit suicide live on the air. The network swings into panic mode, until one shrewd programing executive, played by Faye Dunaway, realizes the potential of having Beale stay on the air. Beale gets more airtime and begins to raise the stakes of what television was able to broadcast at that time. It all culminates with that famous blood-curdling speech in which he directs the audience to get up out of their chairs, open their windows and scream to the heavens ""I'm mad as hell, and I'm not gonna take it anymore!"". Beale becomes a television phenomenon, and UBS is in the money. But with fame comes corruption and risk. What Beale and the rest of the network begin to realize is how the influence and power of television sucks the humanity out of our very existence and how basic dignity is replaced with ratings.It goes without saying, but Network is a powerhouse film for outstanding acting. Dunaway, Holden and Duvall command the screen at every turn, and bounce off of each other with ease. In that sense, it's feels like more of a stage play than a film. Then, of course, is Peter Finch. This was his final performance on film. What a hell of a way to go out. There hasn't been, nor will there ever be a more passionate on-screen performance than this.",Network
108,cultfilmfan,Network,7,9 September 2005,"Network, is about a TV newscaster named Howard Beale, who is going to be fired from the news show because of low ratings. He then says on public TV that he is going to kill himself. The people at the network get very worried but then some of the big executives find out that it got them a lot of ratings so they plan to give him a regular show where he can rant and rave. Soon they are exploiting him and the audience loves it. One of the network workers named Max Schumacher, is very against this but is soon fired and a woman he is seeing from the company named Diana Christensen, seems to want it to continue so the cash will flow in. Winner of The Oscar for Best Actor In A Leading Role (Peter Finch, who plays Howard Beale), Best Actress In A Leading Role (Faye Dunaway, who plays Diana Christensen), Best Actress In A Supporting Role (Beatrice Straight, who plays Max's wife) and Best Screenplay Written Directly For The Screen at The Academy Awards, The BAFTA Film Award for Best Actor at The BAFTA Awards, The David Award for Best Foreign Actress (Faye Dunaway) at The David Di Donatello Awards, The Golden Globe Award for Best Director (Sidney Lumet), Best Actor In A Drama, Best Actress In A Drama (Faye Dunaway) and Best Screenplay at The Golden Globes, The LAFCA Award for Best Director, Best Picture and Best Screenplay at The Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards, The NYFCC Award for Best Screenplay at The New York Film Critics Circle Awards, The PGA Hall Of Fame Motion Pictures Award at The PGA Golden Laurel Awards and The WGA Award for Best Drama Written Directly For The Screen at The Writers Guild Of America.

Network, is an interesting film with a sharp and biting edge to it and it is a pretty good satire and in some ways is ahead of it's time and these days we can see how it really relates to the TV we watch. The film was also compelling and well made and I liked the message and what the film had to say. The film is considered a masterpiece by some critics and as mentioned above it has won a lot of awards. I didn't think this film was a masterpiece as some people did but I still thought it was an interesting film with a good sharp message.",Network
109,stamper,I can see what they are doing with the film and I can actually appreciate it,7,8 October 2004,"Network is much more than just a film, about the madness of the TV industry. It is a film about the madness of the human being, the corruption of politics and the rape of the truth. Now I must admit that the film probably is not for everybody, because it isn't very thrilling and it might appear a tad slow to some. Personally I thought it was a very interesting film and I found myself comparing the depicted situations with the reality of today. It made me wonder how much of the films contents were regarded crazy in 1976, which I now (in 2004) found to be plausible or even true. If you like the plot summary on IMDb give this one a try. You might just get as interested as I did.6,75 out of 10 (with a 7 given upon voting)",Network
110,gab-14712,"""I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore.""",9,18 October 2017,"This is the most famous line in 1976's Network and could possibly be one of the most famous lines of the decade in film. That quote is said by Howard Beales, perhaps the most memorable character of the movie. When people think about this movie, most of them think about the antics of Howard Beale in the movie. His character is associated on a real-life scenario where some news reporter committed an on-air suicide. We shall talk more about this character later, but this film is more than just about Howard Beale. This is a scathing satire about the decline of actual news reporting. The theme is simple and it leads into today's news reporting. They just report what people want to hear, not actual stories. If ratings are bad, you can say goodbye to reporters, newscasters, programs, etc. and they will be replaced no matter how good they are. What the movie does very well is conveying those themes to the audience. The movie wasn't kind to the route the future of news reporting was heading.One incredible part of the movie which stood out to me is the screenplay. The film was written by Paddy Chayefsky and it was one of the four Oscar wins the film earned. He really understood the news business and he once said a quote which provided an inspiration for the movie, I believe. He said, ""Television would do anything for a rating..anything."" Unfortunately, that holds true today. If a critically-acclaimed show gets poor ratings, it will probably get canceled despite the strong reviews. It was more or less the same in the 1970's, but more with the news. Chayefsky also brought across a point saying that you can do anything or say anything you want on television, but if you threaten the profits of the networks they will end you. This was a very good inspired screenplay that set up the base for the movie.So let's discuss what this film is about. In the 1970's, extreme violence headed by terrorists were the source of the nightly news. Meanwhile, the corporate structure of the UBS Television Network was in the midst of a drastic change. Howard Beale (Peter Finch) is an aging news anchor who has poor ratings and the network decides to fire him. Beale reacts by saying on-air that he will commit suicide. That causes his ratings to skyrocket to high levels and he is changed as he becomes a preacher of a sort. We see how this affects members of the corporate team such as Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway) and Max Schumacher (William Holden).As with most if not all films directed by Sidney Lumet, the performances are all great. I was wowed by Peter Finch's portrayal of Howard Beale. He became some sort of a drunken preacher and my favorite scene is right after he said the famous quote from the opening of this review, he told his viewers to go to their windows and shout ""we are not going to take it anymore!"" There was a shot that had people shouting out their windows in the apartment buildings and I found that to be some comedic gold. Finch was fantastic and he won the Academy Award for Best Actor. In fact, he died shortly after this film's release and he was the first actor to receive a posthumous victory. Even though most people remember Finch as Howard Beale, this film is centered on the exploits of Diana Christensen whom is played marvelously by Faye Dunaway who was previously in 1974's Chinatown. This film had more focus on women, which I love to see from a 70's film. She would do anything for ratings- even if it means meeting up with terrorists. (that scene featuring her and the terrorists in a meeting was weak, however). William Holden continues his long Hollywood career in this film as the elder executive who is mesmerized by Diana despite her ruining his news division and begins an affair with her. He was very convincing. Also convincing was the portrayal of Max's wife, Louise whom was played by Beatrice Straight. She won an Oscar for Supporting Actress despite getting only five minutes of screen time. But she delivered a heart-wrenching, emotional speech to her husband after she found about the affair and because of that speech, I believe she earned her Oscar statue. In addition to getting caliber talent for the leads, Lumet stacked up his supporting cast very well. He was able to get the likes of Robert Duvall and Ned Beatty to make very convincing cameos.I enjoyed Network to a large degree. It was a sensation when released it 1976 because it earned ten Oscar nominations. In terms of the themes, it holds up incredibly strong. In terms of production design and cinematography, well you can tell the movie is forty years old. What stood out to me is Paddy Chayefsky's classic screenplay, Sidney Lumet's fluid directing, wonderful acting performances across the board, and the messages that are very influential today. Despite the antics of Howard Beale, this film is women-focused and I love that. But also see this movie for Peter Finch's incredible performance. This movie is angry at television and will forever be. After all, networks only care for their ratings not the content. Instead of delivering news and heart-warming stories, news are all about terrorists and violence. Nothing much has changed in that regard since 1976. While not the best movie of 1976, it is worth the watch.My Grade: A-",Network
111,bankofmarquis,Eerily prescient classic,10,9 February 2018,"""I'M MAD AS HELL, AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE IT ANYMORE!""One of the most famous lines in film history is as impactful today as it was when it was first uttered by fictitious news anchor Howard Beale in Paddy Chayefsky's (seemingly) parody of where TV and TV news is heading, 1976's NETWORK.The astonishing thing about this terrific motion picture is how prescient it is. News is now entertainment. Appeal to the disaffected masses. Drive our message to the viewers. Be provocative. The 6:00 news had ""less than 1 minute of hard news, the rest was sex, scandal, brutal crime sports, children with incurable diseases and lost puppies.""Sound familiar? This isn't from today, it came from this movie that was made 42 years ago as a cautionary tale of what might happen.Besides the social ramifications, how does this film hold up? Quite well, indeed. A rare 10 star BankofMarquis film. Starting with the great Paddy Chayefsky's Oscar winning Screenplay. This was the capper on a brilliant career from Chayefsky - who also won Oscar's for his screenplay for 1972's THE HOSPITAL (I'll have to check that one out) and 1956's MARTY.What does a terrific screenplay do? It attracts top-level talent clamoring to be in this - and they all deliver. Start with Faye Dunaway who won the Lead Actress Oscar for her role as Entertainment Head Diane Christensen - a driven, work hard, play hard individual who has the idea to make news ""entertainment"". Lost in the fog of time (and MOMMIE DEAREST) is the fact that in the mid-1970's, Dunaway was, perhaps, the greatest leading actress of the day and her skills are in sharp display in this film.Joining Dunaway in terrific supporting turns are Robert Duvall, following his turns as Tom Hagen in GODFATHER I and II, as network head, Frank Hackett, Ned Beatty as Ned Jennings, President of the company that owns the network - he has a speech towards the tail end of this film that is as good - both in performance and in the way that it is shot - as anything put upon the screen - it was masterful. Speaking of masterful, Beatrice Straight won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in one of the shortest performances to ever win. She is in this film for about 6 minutes in total - but she won her Oscar for a 5 minute scene that is, most definately Oscar-worthy.And then there are the leading men. William Holden gives one of the last great performances of his extraordinary career as the ""voice of reason in this film"". He is our everyman caught up in the bizarre, absurd circumstances that evolve around him. It is his effort to try to make sense of this insanity that jumps off the screen. Holden was, deservedly, nominated for a Best Actor in a Leading Role Oscar, but lost (rightfully so) to Peter Finch's turn as crazed newsman turned prophet, Howard Beale. His maniacal (but not over the top) turn is one for the ages. If you do nothing else, see this film for his performance (but there is so, so much more to love here). Unfortunately, Finch passed away from a heart attack in between his Oscar nomination and win, and was the first posthumous winner in an acting role (sadly, Heath Ledger would join this ""club"" years later).Finally, enough cannot be said about Sidney Lumet's direction. A movie like this would not succeed without a sure, steady and seasoned hand at the helm - and this is how I would describe Lumet's direction. He lets the camera roll and lets the actors and the screenplay take center stage, not drawing attention away, but adding to the themes of the film throughout - especially in Beatty's speech at the end.NETWORK was nominated for (but did not win) the Oscar for Best Film of 1976. Did it lose out to other nominees ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN or TAXI DRIVER? Nope, it lost to ROCKY.Let that sink in.If you get a chance to watch (or rewatch) this film, I highly recommend you do so. For me, it was GREAT to watch this on the big screen with an audience, one of the reasons I love - and will continue to attend - the SECRET CINEMA series of films.Letter Grade: A+10 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)",Network

113,cchase,Prescient...,9,28 August 2005,"It is the only word I can come up with to describe this masterfully savage satire, and IMHO, it's the only word that need be used.Once I had seen ALTERED STATES and read the novel, I was hungry to find out more about the late novelist/playwright/screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky, and sought out this movie. It blew me away years ago, but I find it even more stunning now. Not just because of the writing, Sidney Lumet's taut direction or the Oscar-caliber performances by everyone involved, all of which are almost beyond being lauded with superlatives.But what knocks me out is how Chayefsky seemed less to be writing from the power of his imagination, than channeling Our Times Now. As if he was capable of some form of mental time travel; able to look into the Nineties and beyond to see the coming of SURVIVOR, or Maury Povich, Jerry Springer, Bill O'Reilly and Paris Hilton. Even HE probably didn't know how he knew, but he sure as hell felt it and wrote it down for us to marvel over today.Sure, there are political and cultural analogies throughout the picture that are dated. But the core of his vision remains startlingly clear and eerily prophetic. As for Howard Beale, there is not one single ""celebrity"" who mirrors that character today, but maybe he is a composite of several different personalities with whom we have become all too familiar in the world of ""news-fo-tainment."" Or maybe he simply hasn't materialized yet. Maybe that is just how far ahead of its time NETWORK really was.After all, being ""mad as hell"" nowadays has so many more layers of meaning than it did nearly thirty years ago...",Network

115,bellino-angelo2014,Nearly excellent movie with a great and insightful script,9,21 February 2021,"I saw this movie for the first time in 2014 and I thought it was a great movie. 6 years later I re-watched it and my opinion hasn't changed a lot. I think that this is one of those movies that aged well. Just how far a network will go for ratings by the audience? This is the movie's principal question.Howard Beale (Peter Finch) is the anchorman of the evening news of UBS news and is slowly losing his mind. During a nervous breakdown he announces that he's going to kill himself on the air and even the soulless people at the network are upset until the ratings increase as in the next broadcast Beale uses lots of profanity. Then they are delighted when they see the horrible scene of a guy losing his hold on reality. And this sort of dumb programming results in even more stupid and pointless shows (such as one that glorifies terrorists and encourages them to film their sick actions so that everyone can see them on TV). The sickest and funniest aspect is that the terrorists were becoming Capitalists concerned with profits from the ratings.Paddy Chayefsky wrote one of the most intelligent scripts ever and not surprisingly he won the Academy Award for it. The acting is excellent from the leads: Peter Finch gives a great performance as a crazed anchorman and even won the Academy Award for Best Actor tho William Holden was the real lead. Holden is great and handsome as always and Faye Dunaway shines as the woman who falls in love with him despite having a shallow relationship (based only on looks). Robert Duvall is very good and he was probably the most entertaining character in the movie. Beatrice Straight was good too as Holden's former wife although I can't understand why she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress as she only appeared for like, 5 minutes in a movie of 2 hours.Apart the few gripes I wrote above I highly recommend this movie as it's like a satire of what networks can do for having always high ratings. And truly deserves its cult status as a classic from the 1970s cinema.",Network
116,AhmedSpielberg99,This is the most effective satire film I've ever watched.,8,12 June 2018,"It's thoroughly devastating, and that's because it doesn't work on one level. While Network's wry humor is very sharp and truly sore, it's the sympathy I had for Howard Beale, Peter Finch's character, that got me. Actually, the movie's obvious flaw is that the aspect that is focused on, which is the political satirical one, is underdeveloped, or let's say that all small changes that happen don't make the story any better, instead, they made the satire less sharp, and made me less interested in the story.By contrast, the character of Beale is continuously developed, and it's character arc is painful to witness from the very beginning to the end. However, what really made me engaged despite the semi-hollow main plot are two things:the first thing is the intelligent dialogue; it should be listed in top 10 movie dialogues of all-time. It easily can trick us as the plot is very well-developed.The second thing is the characters, not only Howard Beale, but almost every character is a three-dimensional one. Specially when I was totally invested in all the characters, and how couldn't I with, maybe, the greatest cast ensemble performing the roles?
Of course, Peter Finch is great, and balances very well between his moments of wrath, and his moments of psychopathic coldness. But, c'mon, his performance is far cry from De Niro's in Taxi Driver, which is arguably the best performance in film. The performances that standout for me are William Holden's as Max Schumacher, he really deserved to win the Oscar, and Faye Dunaway's performance as Diana Christensen, which I think this is her best performance ever even better than her performance in Chinatown , and, fortunately, she took the Oscar for this role as the Best Actress in a Leading Role. Robert Duvall also, and as usual, gave a terrific performance. Needless to say, the entire cast is phenomenal!I want to say that I love Sidney Lumet direction. He always shot the conversations in his movies in a way that make us feel they actually happen in real life, and 12 Angry Men and Dog Day Afternoon are the finest examples. But in the case of Network, there are some scenes that don't need to be shot this fast, they needed a little more focus, a little more dramatic feeling. The result is some scenes that could have been more effective if they were less rushed, also, there are some acting, which is great, that seemed to be over the top. And that's just because the direction, not the acting itself, except one scene in which the acting was really hammy. Also, the ending is rushed, but it's very shocking. With that being said, Lumet established a disturbing atmosphere, that due to it, nothing in this movie would have worked.All in all, I enjoyed watching this movie that left a bitter taste in mouth, because of nothing but its accuracy which made it very relevant nowadays. And despite all its major flaws, Sidney Lumet made a satirical drama that still one of a kind.(8/10)",Network
117,vostf,Too brainy and not subtle enough: TV wins,5,7 June 2007,"Well I had been waiting to see Network for a long time and it seems this one is not the astute TV satire I was longing for. Was this movie prescient? Not really, it was a clever, yet heavy, analysis of what TV was becoming. Being clever and not showing it, letting the other get the point and find himself better, that's another story altogether.I never felt involved in the story told, I could only admire some keys scenes with their sharp dialogue and strong performances but . And even in those acting award-winning scenes I was not involved: too clever, too perfect, an idealistic roll of words brought to you by the Clever Bunch, a division of the whole Network. Plus the clever choice to get a documentary look, as in All the President's Men, was from shot to shot on the verge of dumb ugliness.What doesn't work for me in Network? First we do not get personally and emotionally involved with one specific character or another. Howard Beale (Peter Finch) seems to be the first one we should care for before his character arc gears down to his pathetic secondary path. Then the story switches to Max Schumacher (William Holden) but does he really fight for a better network, better news or a better life? No, the grumpy old man groans and moans: he is mostly a passive character. Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway) is a go-getter with no spare emotions, Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall) is the corporate hatchet man and the rest are bit parts in the tapestry. To cap it all there's a sporadic neutral voice-over narrator (had too much to cut out dudes?) who seems to tell us nobody is that important in the story, only the über clever story itself should be the focus of our attention.Faye Dinaway stands for everything the movie is: too brainy, not emotional enough, focused on what's her job and never taking the chance to change. That the message is so outspoken in Network is arguably the worst part of it, it foils the whole satire. The description of the corrupt little world of TV is so evenly crude, so continuously filthier than life there is no emotional variation in the two-hour show. No escape, no recycling: the rhythm is glued to Howard Beale's career but Howard Beale is not the main character. TV is the superhero here, and eventually TV succeeded in leveling the satire down to an unfunny noisy little show soon to be canceled. Evil wins. The clever guys were so smart as to eek out an inoffensive satire and get away with the awards. I quit.",Network
118,virek213,Mad as hell...and great as ever!,10,26 July 2001,"Much as Stanley Kubrick took a satirical aim at America's Cold War paranoia in DOCTOR STRANGELOVE, so too do Sidney Lumet and Paddy Chayefsky take a satirical aim at television in NETWORK, still one of the most pointed films ever made.  The film centers around UBS, a fourth-place TV network without a single show in the Nielsen Top 20.  Then their long-time TV newsman Howard Beale (Peter Finch), having been canned due to poor ratings, announces on the air that he is going to kill himself!  But that's not the end of it. The following night, he comes back on and apologizes, saying that he ""just run out of bulls***!"".  The ratings soar right through the roof, inspiring the two top people at UBS (Robert Duvall, Faye Dunaway) to give Finch his own show--a deal that is sealed when Finch urges his audience to open their windows and yell, ""I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not gonna take this anymore!""Back in 1976, of course, NETWORK was so outrageous that everyone in television dismissed it as a joke.  But look around you now, and you'll see that its visions of tabloid journalism and guerilla warfare TV shows are perilously close to coming true today.  And what else is Finch's Howard Beale character but a model for, respectively, Rush Limbaugh (on the Right) and Howard Stern (on the Left), and even Jerry Springer (in the Toilet!)?Finch and Dunaway won Oscars for their lead roles, and Beatrice Straight won a Supporting Actress Oscar for her brief role as the wife of UBS' former, conscience-stricken news department chief (William Holden).  Holden's performance is also incredible and explosive; who would have thought that the ""Golden Boy"" would ever say, on film, ""Tell Mr. Hackett (Duvall) to go f**k himself!""?NETWORK, to sum it all up, is still brilliant and now more timely than ever before.

Another thing I really liked about this movie was the intelligent screenplay by Paddy Chayefsky who really deserved a lot of credit for the making of this motion picture achievement.",Network
121,WriterDave,"This isn't one of your Scripts, Diana!",10,18 March 2006,"""Network"" is a blazing, ballsy, and smoothly calculated satire of all things American and Corporate as seen through the tunneled vision of mass market consumerism in the form of television. Made in 1976 with no-nonsense old-school direction from Sydney Lumet and a so-good-it's-almost-sick script from Paddy Chayefsky, this is not only the second best film satire ever made (behind only ""Dr. Strangelove"" in my book) but also a simplistic hologram of what every great film, no matter what the genre, should be: a stone-cold acting, writing, and directing tour-de-force.Faye Dunaway (Oscar winner) is icy perfection as the programming exec who will put anything on TV for higher ratings. Peter Finch is ""mad as hell"" in his Oscar winning performance as the ""mad prophet of the airways"" spouting off tangents on everything from soulless consumerism to the dangers of MidEast corporate buy-outs (sadly things are still the same thirty years later). William Holden is equally good in his part as an aging and recently axed news exec looking for old-fashioned love in a crazy god-less new world. Robert Duvall (with his dreams of big-titted hits), Ned Beatty (with his forces of nature), and everyone else involved are all amazing. This is one of those films so perfectly tailored to its cast and sublimely directed that an actress (Beatrice Straight as Holden's wife) can walk onto screen for a mere five minutes, exorcise her lines as if this is her death dirge as an artist, and walk off with an Oscar.Then of course there is the writing. This is a film not only of great lines (like ""I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!"") but also of grandiose, verbose, and articulate dialogue (take any of the Dunaway-Holden scenes or the Beatty/Finch showdown of apocalyptic proportions). Only ""Casablanca,"" ""Annie Hall"" and perhaps ""Paris, Texas"" can compete with ""Network"" for best film dialogue ever.And finally, this is one of the few classics ripe (and dare I say begging) for re-imagining. In 1976 this was a hilariously dark satire joking about the worst case scenario of a new world order. Viewed today, it's a horrifying oracle of things that came true. If ever was there a film from the past with a more urgent message, I dare you to name it.",Network
122,Eumenides_0,Chayefski's Prophetic Masterpiece,9,11 April 2013,"The magical year of 1976 that gave us masterpieces like Taxi Driver, All The President's Men and Novecento also gave us Network, one of the most prophetic movies ever made.When Howard Beale, a mentally insane TV anchorman with falling ratings, announces that he's going to commit suicide live on the last day of his job, he suddenly becomes a media sensation and the surprise hit the flagging network needs to improve its ratings. Diana Christensen, head of the network's programming department, convinces her boss, Hackett, to allow her to turn Beale into a modern day prophet to articulate the American public's anger, cynicism, and disenchantment with Vietnam, Watergate, the recession, etc.Beale is a good and prescient example of networks co-opting counterculture: as he stands on a stage, with a church window behind him, delivering his rants, he doesn't understand that he's but the puppet of a network that has turned indignation and radicalism into fashionable entertainment. There's absolutely nothing different between Beale and all our modern-day radicals who've sold out to vested interests while thinking they're working outside and against the system. But this is just one of the most prophetic ironies of the movie.There are more. It wouldn't take a stretch of the imagination to expect one day networks to kill people for ratings, like the movie suggests. The recent scandal surrounding Rupert Murdoch's News of the World newspaper already point us in that direction: they didn't kill anyone, but they sure as hell had no moral qualms interfering with police investigations that had human lives at stake. Just give the media time, they'll turn this movie's prophecy reality.But perhaps the best prophecy of the movie comes in the form of the speech delivered by the CCA chairman, Arthur Jensen. After Beale informs the audience that UBS network has been bought by CCA, a conglomerate owned by Saudi Arabians, Jensen calls Beale to his darkened room where he explains to him how the real modern world works. ""There are no nations. There are no peoples. There are no Russians. There are no Arabs. There are no third worlds. There is no West. There is only one holistic system of systems, one vast and immane, interwoven, interacting, multivariate, multinational dominion of dollars. Petro-dollars, electro-dollars, multi-dollars, reichmarks, rins, rubles, pounds, and shekels. It is the international system of currency which determines the totality of life on this planet. That is the natural order of things today."" This is but one part of the speech but it's one of the most accurate things ever written in cinema! And it's hilariously delivered by Ned Beatty, who on account of this single scene got himself a much deserved Oscar nomination.In fact this movie is full of great acting from start to finish, the cast imposes respect: Robert Duvall, Faye Dunaway, Peter Finch, William Holden, and Beatrice Straight, a fine mixture of veterans at the end of their illustrious careers (Finch in fact died shortly after the movie and received an Oscar for his performance as mad prophet Beale), and excellent young actors who had been carving names for themselves for the past decade. Sydney Lumet draws legendary performances from all of them. His minimalist style, without flashy camera angles and music, allows the viewer to focus the viewer solely on the actors delivering Paddy Chayefsky's brilliant lines back and forth. I've seen his three Oscar-winning movies, and this is Chayefsky's crowning achievement, a black satire that did nothing less than predict the modern world.",Network

With all the reality shows, like Cops and Survivor, and the real world. All the shows about shows, MTV doing the history of MTV. And all the brainless action and mindnumbing stupidity on TV ie WWF, XFL, Jackass. One has to ask the question, was Network talking about television then or was it forecasting television now? The movie does have strong intones of prophecy. Furthermore there's another strong point in the movie, the dehumanization of individuals by conglomorates. This point is brought down crashingly hard hear as it is in Fight Club. First it was social groups, then the church then the nations (as in Catch 22), and now the globilization brought about by the conglomorates who preach the gosphel of the almighty dollar. The only option is suicide or the complete and total rejection of society as a whole. This movie at turns is satire, drama, propaganda, farce, surrealism, and societal commentary. It is finely portayed by all of it's actors. ""I've seen the face of god"" ""You might be right"" It is well scripted given the complexity of the subject matter. And there is a fine fine performance from Tim Robbins. But I'm left wondering about the whole William Holden/Faye Dunawaye part of the movie.

125,MichaelMargetis,"""I'm mad as hell and I'm not gonna take it anymore!"" - Howard Beale",9,25 August 2005,"#1 Best Film of 1976'Network' is Paddy Chafesky's riveting and grim tale of the sleaze surrounding the American television industry. Winner of the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, 'Network' is without a doubt one of the most powerful, influential and meaningful films ever made. One of the reasons 'Network' was so well received by both film critics and movie-going audiences was because it possessed a certain quality that most films unfortunately lack -- intricate and involving characters in realistic situations. 'Network' definitely makes my list of the top 10 films of the 70s, and it's an absolute shame it didn't pick up the well-deserved 'Best Picture' Oscar at the Academy Awards ceremony in 1976.The film follows a low-rated television network trying to keep it's head above water. The network, UBS, has decided to fire an aging veteran news anchor, Howard Beale (Peter Finch), in an act of desperation to boost ratings. Beale is given a two-week notice, and instead of going out with his tale between his legs, Beale announces on live television he was fired and is going to kill himself. This raises panic and chaos at UBS, until they get the memo that Beale's crazed rant just bumped the ratings significantly. The UBS execs, Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway) and Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall) decide to give Beale his own show where he complains and screams bout the problems with the world, while Beale's best friend (William Holden) feels it's inappropriate for the network to take advantage of a mentally-ill man. Besides exploiting a mentally unstable man, the company execs also work out a weekly program with a anti-establishment African-American communist, Laureen Hobbs (Marlene Warfield) following political terrorists and their violent outbursts.The film also stars Beatrice Straight as Schumacher's boring wife, Conchetta Ferrell was an assistant working for the network and Ned Beatty who plays the sinister boss of the UBS television network who always gets what he wants.'Network' boasts one of the finest and most intricate screenplays ever written that rightfully earned Paddy Chafesky the Oscar for Best Screenplay. Sidney Lumet's directing is absolutely incendiary and the movie has an incredibly strong cast. Faye Dunaway gives what is perhaps her very best screen performance as the cutthroat Network executive, while Robert Duvall is just as brilliant as the ruthless Frank Hackett (which should have earned him an Oscar nomination, period!) Beatrice Straight is solid in her role (not quite Oscar-worthy if you ask me, though) and Marlene Warfield is just as great as the sassy pinko sistah (excuse me for that phrasing). The two performers who really steal the show however are William Holden and Peter Finch. Both nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role at the Academy Awards in 1977, Peter Finch gives a startling and powerful performance as the 'mad-as-hell' (not to mention crazy-as-hell) Howard Beale, while William Holden gives a subtle but none-the-less outstanding performance as the conflicted Max Schumacher. It's hard to say who was better, but if I absolutely had to decide I'd choose Holden's non-Oscar-winning performance slightly over Finch's sympathy Oscar-winning performance (he still was extraordinary,m though). I honestly believe if Finch hadn't died just after the film, Holden would have taken home the Oscar gold for Best Leading Actor, both were still magnificent though. The only player in the cast that I felt wasn't that great was Ned Beatty. In a role far-deserving from an Oscar nomination (which he for some odd reason received), Beatty plays the angry little man role he always does. Besides Beatty's performance and marginal pacing problems towards the middle (you are gonna get that in any 70s film that isn't a Kubrick film), the movie is utterly perfect.I can't recommend you seeing 'Network' highly enough. If you want a carefully made motion picture that makes you think and reflect on how cutthroat our society has become (especially TV broadcasting), 'Network' is a absolute must. What are you waiting for, go out and rent 'Network'! It might just alter your perspective on things. Grade: A-MADE MY TOP 300 LIST AT #46",Network

Okay, even though I didn't get that speech right, you'll get my drift once I write this review.""Network"" is a movie about ratings and how executives will do anything to keep up with their ratings. Howard Beale (Peter Finch) is a reporter who is getting the boot from his good buddy and chairman of the board Max Schumacher (William Holden) after ratings from his reports go down the crapper. Beale begs to make his final farewell where an epiphany hits his head where no longer will he play by the rules and just tells the truth that people want to hear. Max is fired with Beale heading off as well until the new chairman Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall) and an new executive Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway) try to bring back Howard after the ratings hit the roof. After Beale hits the roof with his famous ""I'm as mad as hell"" speech, he has his own show in Hollywood where he preaches about the truth from television, commerce, etc,.The film was often noted as a satire with Roger Ebert, years later, calling it a prophet saying that without this movie or Beale's messages that the WWF, Jerry Springer or football games wouldn't exist on television.Or in this generation: Dancing with the Stars, American Idol, Disney Channel, Fear Factor, Deal or No Deal, Are you smarter than a fifth grader?, etc.It's true! Many people, mostly Americans, often sit their asses down watching TV channel surfing than reading books, magazines and figuring out why the government hides secret, why their gas and food prices are going up, the effects on social security, thinking of monsters and bad guys as good rather than the cops and politicians who are corrupted, or information that could make those a better person rather than being a flock of sheep.Watch ""Network"" before you decide to flip to the next station.",Network

129,jhaggardjr,"Strong, although over-the-top, satire",8,16 March 2001,"""Network"" is an extremely well-acted satire on the television industry which at times feels like it's spinning out of control. The big name cast includes Faye Dunaway, William Holden, Peter Finch, Robert Duvall, Ned Beatty, and Beatrice Straight. All give excellent performances in ""Network"", which is about a fictional TV network (UBS) that is far behind the three big TV networks in ratings (CBS, NBC, and ABC; long before Fox, UPS, and the WB networks hit the air). The executives at UBS try to do anything to get their network some good ratings, which includes giving their insane news anchorman (Finch) his own show. This is the movie where Finch says that famous line: ""I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not gonna take this anymore!"" A classic line in movie history. Finch won a posthumous Best Actor Oscar for his portrayl of the crazy newsman who cracks up during his newscasts. He's good, but I think the best performance in ""Network"" is turned in by Dunaway as the heartless programming executive who comes up with some of the wildest ideas in turning UBS into a hit. When Dunaway is on screen, I couldn't take my eyes off of her. She's a very strong prescene throughout this movie. She deservedly won the Best Actress Oscar for her work here. Straight (""Poltergeist""), who won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for this movie, gives the shortest Oscar-winning performance in film history with her 5 1/2 minute appearence as Holden's scorned wife. Another Oscar went to Paddy Chayefsky's screenplay. While ""Network"" is strongly acted most of the time, there were moments where it felt like the movie started going over-the-top. Most of the characters in this movie spend alot of time yelling and shouting at one another and after a while it got on my nerves. This doesn't happen during every frame of its two hour length, but it happens quite often. For example, Ned Beatty's big scene. He does a great job, but the scene is so laughable because Beatty goes so overboard. Duvall goes over-the-top as well in many of his scenes. But so do Dunaway, Holden, Straight, and (of course) Finch. Despite this minor setback, ""Network"" is still a very good movie.

Finch is firing on all cylinders as suicidal newsreader-turned-mad prophet of the airwaves Howard Beale, richly deserving his posthumous Oscar.

The late great Finch plays Beale, an anchorman working at a network that is losing in the ratings and is in the red. When he is fired, Beale starts to slowly go over the edge, first by telling the viewers that he would kill himself on the air, and then by constantly swearing. This catches the eye of Diana Christensen (Ice queen Faye Dunaway),who works in the Entertainment division. With a little coaxing to Hackett(Robert Duvall), she turns Beale into a media sensation, while Beale himself is becoming more and more insane. His friend Max (William Holden)wants to help, but the powers that be stop him. Plus, he's become involved with Diana, knowing full well that she has no soul in her(She has sex with him while talking about future shows that she's creating for the network). When he begins to talk about the network itself and his ratings fall, they kill the show...literally!It's funny that this film pretty much sums up today's media, in which ratings is more important than the human condition, that dollars are more important than real emotions (When Max leaves Diana, he tells her that she's ""television incarnate,"" and that she feels nothing).

It is screenwriter Paddy Chayevsky's finest hour, a fearless piece of writing.Sidney Lumet, having delivered the dazzling DOG DAY AFTERNOON the previous year, was evidently on a roll. He and his team follow the script everywhere it leads them, from boardroom to bedroom via terrorist hideout. The wonderful cast rise to challenge of their superbly written roles, led by Faye Dunaway, incarnating an emotionally-stunted ratings-chaser; William Holden, in his last great role, as a compromised news exec; Robert Duvall as a ruthless corporation man; and best of all, relishing his long diatribes against the system and delivering them with all the passion at his command, the great Peter Finch, in his last-ever role - what a way to go!

I strain to think of a film that is a more brilliant take on society, and all of the flaws it has. It's obedience and entertainment by those who rebel, no matter how insane they are. The exploitation of those in peril for any kind of economic profit. And the fact that everything Beale preaches is completely true and completely bashes the people who are producing him. I was amazed by how much he sells out while continuing to rant about how terrible the people he works for are, and the fact that they just keep him on the air because they want ratings.It couldn't be more related to today. Turn on the news and you see videos of how horrific the war on terror is and how horrific American society has become, but it stays on the air because people don't want to see the good things in life. They care about the bad and the corrupt. People must have laughed it off back then, but it was such a foreshadow to the near future. The performances are just as brilliant as the social commentary. Each actor becomes so absorbed into their characters that you can't even tell they're acting. It feels like you're watching these people in their daily lives, interacting and becoming more and more corrupt. Finch and Dunaway easily give two of the greatest performances of all time.

Many of these are now American classics, yet only a handful remember who directed them. The late Lumet, one of the greatest American filmmakers of the last fifty years, sadly remains relatively unknown outside of film circles, yet a number of his films have been enduring and relevant till today, reminding us that good stories may grow old but they never die.Network, perhaps Lumet's second most acclaimed film after 12 Angry Men, stars Faye Dunaway, Peter Finch, William Holden, Robert Duvall in leading roles, and Ned Beatty and Beatrice Straight in supporting roles. With the exception of Duvall, all five actors were nominated for Oscars for their performances, with Dunaway, Finch, and Straight clinching the golden man. Lumet was in every way an actor's director, thus it is not surprising to be wowed by the strength of the performances on display here.Like Dr. Strangelove (1964) and Brazil (1985), which satirize international politics and bureaucratic industrialization respectively, Network is a verbal and vulgar tirade aimed at the madmen who yield power over television networks. Written by Paddy Chayefsky, whose original screenplay also secured an Oscar, Lumet's film is a razor-sharp attack on the media industry, specifically targeting broadcast news' tendency to exploit victims to drive up viewership and ratings to appease stakeholders and to gain profits and industry stature.In Network, the victim is one of their own – Howard Beale (Finch), a long-time newscaster of a television network that sacks him because of poor ratings for his news programme. In his penultimate episode, he declares that he will kill himself live on television in his last week, leading to a bizarre chain of events that would see Beale suddenly become not only a television celebrity but also a prophet for the masses. In one of the film's most famous lines, Beale rouses viewers watching his highly-rated programme to go to their nearest window and yell, ""I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore.""Lumet's direction never calls itself to attention. His visual style is near invisible; he focuses completely on the characters that drive the story, never for one moment allowing himself to pause to indulge in a fanciful camera trick or two. Although the film feels somewhat dated visually, the themes that are explored remain relevant today. While it does not feel potent enough from an emotional standpoint, Network's strengths lie in the performances of the cast, and the biting, dark humor that punctuates very regularly in this quite masterful arrow shot at the heart of those who program the goggle box.SCORE: A- (8.5/10 or 4 stars)(www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com)All rights reserved.",Network

Best Actress ..Best Actor..Best Supporting Actress. This was not just about the script, it was directed with fluidity and vision. When we talk about Network, we are almost talking about something sacred. Looking at it today, it is uncanny how right Mr. Chayefsky was--and incredibly--how he is still right--! He told us how things were then--and now. (quite extraordinary). Some may say ""but its a bleak movie"". Yes it is...finally. It is also funny, perceptive, and forthright with the truth---in the grandest of all scales. It makes me humble to write my opinion about a piece of work that Mozart, Picasso, Tolstoy, or Wittgenstien would have been proud of. This is the fundamental Classic",Network
143,rlaine,"Wasn't as good as I thought, but still good to watch",8,11 June 2012,"I've had this movie on my watchlist for a long time and recently ordered the DVD by chance and watched it. I must say it wasn't quite like I figured it would be.I'm a fan of 70s, early 80s movies, that period produced some of the best social criticism, which in my mind is very important part of movie making. A few days before Network I watched The China Syndrome which I can now say I liked a lot better than Network. They're very similar movies in many ways. Network wasn't bad, but it's so overwritten, underlining and exaggerating it didn't feel that genuine.I can see how Network may have been sort of groundbreaking when it was made. It poked it's own industry in the eye. I've always found this a bit difficult equation. The studio executives may feel purified after producing a movie like this, but it will never be 100 % genuine if it doesn't change anything and everyone knows the TV/movie industry has not redeemed itself since the 70s. On the contrary, we have much more crap coming down the tube. Only the content may not be as sugarcoated as it was back then, but it sure is sensational in a tabloid way and aimed to make profit.It's weird, eye-opening and kind of sad to watch these social commentaries from 30-40 years ago and compare them to todays world. Not much has changed really, generations seem to ""figure out"" the same things over and over again. Howard Beale says ""there is a generation that never knew anything that didn't come out of this tube"". That exact same thing was said all the way to 90's and 00's (until the web took over).Even tho this is not the most genuine of all movies, there isn't this kind of commentary anymore. There are no movies like Soylent Green (1973) which took rapid population growth into focus. We have now almost doubled since 1973 and the problem hasn't gone anywhere. We need movies like they made back then.Getting back to the movie, the casting and acting in the movie are pretty good with one minor thing to complain. Looking at William Holden in the movie, I thought he looked much older than he actually was and probably should've been. He was called ""middle-aged"" many times during the movie, but to me he looked to be nearing the age of 70. Only later I learned he wasn't even 60 when the movie was shot. The same thing bugged me a bit with Eastwoods Breezy. Holden looked much older than he actually was.All in all kind of fun and even sharp social criticism, but not very subtle or a 100 % hit anymore. Howard Beales gospel is nowadays all over the web and facebook statuses. Being only a toddler back when this was made I can't say how this affected the world, but it's effect may show even today.",Network
144,tnrcooper,Seminal take on the hypnotic power of TV,10,22 November 2010,"Many people are dissatisfied with the news media, claiming either that it parrots the prevailing neo-liberal positions on key issues of national importance, or, for some more conservative citizens, that the media is hostile to conservatives and that it is fundamentally impossible for conservative ideas to be considered fairly within the non-FOX news landscape. Not many movies have seriously considered the role of the media and the dynamics between the media and society and the relationship each has on the other.""Network"" shows that even 35 years ago, some of the key concerns people have about the media today resonated. Perhaps more serious critics have stronger concerns than the stronger critics 35 years ago, but the fundamental concern that the media might be abused by those wishing not to inform the public, but by those wishing to blanket the media landscape in meaningless, self-aggrandizing messages, to brainwash the masses in 24-7 soft news has obviously been a concern for some time.""Bulworth"" was a compelling movie in that it depicted a public figure who felt he had nothing to lose and so he felt free to expose the hypocrisy and incestuous nature of the relationship between the media and politicians. Warren Beatty's senator in that movie had the bully pulpit necessary to demand the attention of the media and even when it became clear he was not thinking in terms which conventional media and political figures might be comfortable with, his truth-telling was so searing, so self-evidently honest, and so funny, that it was the sort of comment that the media wanted to cover anyway.""Network"" addresses the dearth of truth-telling in the media, the hunger by execs and suits for empty spectacle as opposed to substantive informing, and once again, the person who speaks the truth about the falsehoods which typify media programming might be considered not completely mentally balanced.It is the sort of dark comedy about the media that one does not see very often. In the film, an aging network anchor-Howard Beale (played with an intoxicating blend of clarity and lunacy in the sort of dream role many actors must wait years-if they ever get the chance-by Peter Finch) is fired by craven network executives Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall as the most villainous of network execs) and Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway in a stupendously well-deserved Oscar turn as a woman who is more ""alpha male"" than many network exec alpha males). However, shortly after receiving the news, Beale says, live on the air, that he will kill himself on the news a week from that day. The executives are at first of course apoplectic at Beale's seeming insanity, but when they see the audience reaction to his madness, they consider how they might capitalize on it.Beale becomes a hit, speaking about the possibilities of self-actualization and happiness, but when his star fades, as all do, network execs are no more sympathetic than they would be for anyone else whose show has become less popular. In the meantime, long-time news division head Max Schumacher (William Holden playing, with a great deal of heart, a sympathetic but concerned (which is to say a true) friend of Beale's) is the conscience of the film, torn between allowing his friend to make the most of his opportunity to speak some truth on the network news, but increasingly worried about the extent to which he is simply another pawn in the game network executives play with programming.The script for the film is one of the most subversive, darkly amusing ones which has ever made comment on the media and Paddy Chayefsky's Oscar for original script is fully deserved. Sidney Lumet's direction is exemplary and the comment on the vacuity of television and its deleterious effect on society was true in 1976 and has become even truer in the intervening years. Again, the acting-most especially by Finch, Dunaway, Holden, and in smaller parts by Marlene Warfield as a black Communist revolutionary who is hilariously well-aware of how much money she is entitled to, Bill Burrows as the perpetually shocked TV director of Beale's show is of the first order, and the script combined with such stellar acting is what makes this film such a powerful, acidic commentary on the narcoleptic power of TV.",Network
145,antagonist117,"A ""Dr. Strangelove"" for the post-détente era",9,20 November 2013,"""Network"" is an artistic successor to ""Dr. Strangelove"" in that it is a black comedy rooted in the real fears of an era. In ""Strangelove"" the bogeyman was the nuclear arms race, and in ""Network"" it is the influence of big corporations (specifically media corporations) in society. These are legitimate fears, of course, but for dramatic and comedic impact they are taken to their most extreme conclusions in these two great comedies.Like many comedies ""Network"" sometimes finds humor in familiar situations and other times in exaggerations and parodies. Robert Duvall and Faye Dunaway are given the freedom to take their characters, or caricatures, all the way to 11. But they act as well as overact: they embody these unbelievable personas as though they have the depths and nuances of Tom Hagens and Evelyn Mulwrays. They say ludicrous things without ever pausing for the laughs, because of course the characters don't realize how incredibly, darkly funny it all is.In addition to a brilliant screenplay that jumps back and forth between sober stockholder meetings and the manic rants of an unstable TV populist, Duvall and Dunaway are two of the biggest reasons why ""Network"" is successfully unsettling as well as successfully funny. We're never quite sure how much to take seriously and how much is cleverly-staged absurdity. For example, the movie's depiction of a sensationalistic, demographics-obsessed media complex seems pretty spot on, but the fluidity with which communists turn into capitalists and capitalists into cosmic nihilists is, while clever, not exactly true-to-life. ""Dr. Strangelove"" struck a similar balance between observational satire and absurdist satire, and benefited from a similarly superb cast and script. In that film, President Muffley was the comforting if impotent moral center, and in this movie he has two counterparts: William Holden's Max Schumacher, an elder statesman of the news business, and a disembodied narrator who is heard both infrequently and too often. The narrator is entirely unnecessary, and truth be told Schumacher gets a little too much screen time, slowing the proceedings with one too many sermons. Muffley never preached, he just watched in horror along with the audience.",Network
146,frankwiener,The Empty Tube,9,3 December 2017,"A neighbor once recently said these words to me, ""There's nothing on television on Thursday night, and I need 'something' to fill the void."" These words made me feel very sad, not only for my neighbor, whose life has obviously been pathetically controlled by the medium of programmed television, but for all of us as a human race. Although I was raised as a child during the so-called ""Golden Age of Television"" with many happy memories of those glorious days, I no longer watch programmed television for several reasons. Instead, what I do is to check the offerings of ""TCM On Demand"", which may very well control part of my life in lieu of television, but, for the most part, it is much more intellectually stimulating and spiritually uplifting than recent television has been, at least in my experience. What's more is that I never seem to run out of films that I want to watch.In my view, this is a movie about a culture clash between those who were a part of that ""Golden Age"", at least in the television news business, and those who contributed to the destruction of the medium, converting it into nothing but a garbage heap only for the sake of ""mass appeal"" and corporate profits. The conflict is established at the very start during the drunken conversation between Howard Beale (Peter Finch) and Max Schumacher (William Holden) and intensifies during their maddening discord with a new generation of television executives such as Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway), Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall), and Arthur Jensen (Ned Beatty). Among the cast, the one unsung hero is Laureen Hobbs, who plays the African American militant, supposedly modeled after real life radical Angela Davis. Appearing with the very best that Hollywood could offer, Ms. Hobbs certainly holds her own, respectable place, and she is hilarious.The script by Paddy Chayefsky is nothing short of brilliant. If you don't agree with me, please read some of his powerful words, including many fascinating monologues by several different characters, in the ""quotes"" section of this very resourceful IMDb website. While Beatrice Straight is impressive in her record- breaking, five minute, Oscar winning diatribe, Mr. Chayefsky's dazzling talent as a writer stands is a significant contributing factor as are the Oscar winning performances of Finch and Dunaway and the Oscar nominated parts by Holden and Beatty. The overall success of this film is the combined result of excellent writing, an exceptional cast that could deliver the knock-out punches that this very able writer handed them, and the very skilled direction of Sidney Lumet.Although Chayefsky clinched three Oscars for his writing (""Marty"", ""The Hospital"", and this film), his life was tragically cut short at the young age of 58. The quality of his work rather than its mere quantity left a strong impact not only upon Hollywood but on the same ""Golden Age of Television"" to which I referred earlier.Aside from the many memorable and meaningful monologues delivered by this extremely talented cast, the one brief instance that summarizes a key message of this film more than any other is when Max pours his heart out to Diana while she can't resist the urge to take a commercial break by answering a telephone call. For me, that says it all. By the way, William Holden may not have received an Oscar for his role here, but he surely deserved one for so effectively conveying the inner turmoil of Max Schumacher at a critical juncture of his life, a very serious matter that should never be minimized in the midst of the frenzied activity that surrounds him.",Network
147,HelloTexas11,dated but memorable,7,6 February 2008,"'Network' was considered quite outrageous when it first came out, and it still has a lot to offer. The performances are uniformly top-notch, and Peter Finch deservedly won an Oscar posthumously for a TV news anchor gone over the edge. Paddy Chayefsky's screenplay is rich with pungent, biting dialogue (even if real people don't talk that way). It is funny and depressing and full of quotable lines. Almost everyone knows the line, ""I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!"" even if they don't know what movie it's from. Unfortunately, fine movie though it is, time has not been kind to 'Network' and it has become dated more noticeably and more rapidly than most films. The reason is simple: the fictional televised insanity it portrays pales in comparison to what has actually become the norm for real television. I daresay someone in their thirties watching 'Network' for the first time might very well wonder what all the fuss was about. A soothsayer or a psychic on a network TV show? So what? Okay, granted it was supposed to be the evening news, but is it any more over-the-top than 24/7 coverage of who's going to end up with Anna Nicole Smith's kid? Or the media circus surrounding Britney Spears? The point is, the world is a very different place than it was just thirty-some-odd years ago when 'Network' came out. If you keep that in mind, you'll still find a wonderfully entertaining movie, one that still makes you think and will stick with you for a long time after you see it. Perenially last-place network UBS stumbles across a hit formula when its above-mentioned newsman is fired and says he's going to kill himself his last day on the air. He makes this declaration during the nightly newscast. Soon UBS' ratings are through the roof and they milk the situation for all it's worth. Howard Beale, the newsman, becomes a huge star (deciding, for the moment, not to kill himself after all) and UBS launches a series of what today would be called 'reality' shows- terrorists shown robbing banks, etc. William Holden plays a news producer at UBS who is from the 'old school'; he reminisces about Ed Murrow and disparages the new generation of television news people. Faye Dunaway's character is one of them. Robert Duvall plays one of the network execs and is hilariously hammy in a couple of scenes (quite a change of pace for him at the time.) He excitedly describes Beale's new show as ""a big fat, big-titted hit!"" And just as in the fictional TV show, Peter Finch pretty much steals the movie. His on-air ""mad as hell"" rant is deservedly famous, brilliantly written by Chayefsky and just as brilliantly performed by Finch. There are several other scenes though, less well-known, where Finch perfectly captures the character of Beale, who seems to slip in and out of madness; at times it comes across as a put-on, others it seems frightfully real. Even his throwaway lines are good- at one point, he enters the UBS building and says, ""I must make my witness."" ""Sure thing, Mr. Beale,"" the doorman replies cheerfully. Paddy Chayefsky initially came to fame during the period of live television dramas in the 1950's, the same training ground that produced such writers as Rod Serling and Reginald Rose. His first big success was 'Marty,' later made into a hit film with Ernest Borgnine. Chayefsky's sharp ear for dialogue and a withering sense of humor distinguish his work, never more so than in his screenplay for 'Network.'",Network
148,Artimidor,What does it need until you can't take it anymore?,9,24 December 2013,"In this day and age collateral damage of mass media productions seems to be taken for granted. While condemned, the fallout is eventually silently accepted, and the circle of criticizing and continuing the same way as before just confirms the tragic truth behind commercialism. Ratings are paramount, entertainment at all costs, sensationalism is what the masses lust for, and individuals, who die due to exhaustion in Survivor shows or are publicly humiliated by prank calls and driven to suicide, are part of the system. All that and more was already anticipated in the brutally outspoken 1976 satire ""Network"" written brilliantly by Paddy Chayefsky and directed by grandmaster Sidney Lumet. Was the picture visionary back in the days? Actually it was a reflection on the on air suicide of an anchorwoman suffering under depression. Nothing has changed. It's still all about ratings and money. Are you fine with that?""Network"" with its startling performances (Peter Finch, Robert Duvall, William Holden, Faye ""television incarnate"" Dunaway), the shockingly dark and cynical script and splendid all around direction is as relevant today as ever, and it's the ultimate film about the amorality that permeates TV business. It is not to be missed, as it will teach you a lesson. It grabs you by the throat, no doubt, it chokes you, doesn't let you go, long after you've seen it. Alas, it's just a movie. If a film like ""Network"" despite its head-on collision course against the system cannot bring a change, maybe it at least contributes to help you consider altering your own viewing habits. No need to get ""mad as hell"" like the film's principal character Howard Beale, but a decisive ""I'm not gonna take this anymore"" will do to confront a mass media machinery with your individualism. To end with the last blood-curdling words of Christine Chubbuck: ""In keeping with Channel 40's policy of bringing you the latest in 'blood and guts', and in living color, you are going to see another first — attempted suicide."" The film's Howard Beale insisted to be a real person. Christine Chubbuck in whose honor the film was written was one. May she rest in peace.",Network

This week I got the answer and I can't understand why it took me this long to discover this absolute gem!Network is an amazing blast to watch. It is a crazy satire, an outrageous farce, and it is of Messianic proportion. The screenplay is masterclass and I can't remember the last time I watch something and be awed by so many bombastic words I have never known, words like 'Ecumenical' and 'cocksmanship'. Throwing big words and high concept around can easily make a film alienating faster than a speeding bullet, but it never once reaches that level. It is blisteringly intelligent and skewers the television industry and the sucker audience mentality with finesse and dark comedy. I just love how the movie shifts gears like a well-oiled machine. Most films identified with a single main narrative thread but this one moves around so many with a blink of an eye and every narrative thread shines. The cast is just stellar and the acid quotable lines spewed out with such intoxicating venom. The movie is not perfect but this is a perfect demo of how to make a perfect imperfect movie - not every thread needs a closure when everything else is done so well. The last scene is such a shocker that I couldn't believe it, but the dialogue is so stirringly chilling that I took it all in and nothing beats Faye Dunaway anchoring it to send it home.

152,imbluzclooby,I'm Mad as hell and Overacting can sometimes help a movie!,8,11 December 2016,"In the US during the Post Watergate-Vietnam War era it seemed like much of our culture was coming apart at the fringes. If not it was definitely revealed in Television. Network may the the first movie to ever take a scathing crack at the corruption of Media mavens in TV Stations, but the theme as implicated here extends to corruption of shareholders, media moguls and the powers that be that control and manipulate them.Howard Biel, played by the legendary Peter Finch, is a washed up News anchor who has been informed his position will be terminated due to ongoing low viewer ratings. He shares an evening with an old buddy, Max Shumacher, a powerful executive from the UBS station. Together they lament the bygone glory days of TV and how they're lives have changed. Hopelessly depressed from anger and exhaustion, Howard Biel decides to announce on air to the public that he will commit suicide. The ratings practically skyrocket overnight. Mr. Biel revitalizes his waning charisma for all the wrong reasons. This is recognized by an ambitious new Program developer, Diane Christensen (Faye Dunaway). She sees this as a golden opportunity to lift UBS out of its rut and to boost ratings again. This is basically what the movie is about, written by Paddy Chayevsky. TV media will shamelessly exploit any person(s), entity or idea just for the sake of improving its stock value. Sensationalism is good whether it's negative or not. She sells her idea to the station's President, FRANK Hackett (Robert Duvall). At first Hackett, Shumacher and the other execs are appalled by lukewarm on the idea, but they later realize that any news is good news as long as it boosts ratings. This is an intelligent film that captures the essence of corporate survival with all of its backbiting, wanton ambition and calculating cruelty where people's jobs are measured in accordance with what they can bring to the financial tables. Faye Dunaway is stunning in a role she was born to play. She exhibits all the qualities of ambitious vixen: cold, calculating, gorgeous and ruthless. William Holden gives an Oscar Worthy performance as the ill-fated executive who is torn between staying with his wife and having an affair with the manipulative Christensen. Peter Finch gives a bravura performance with admirable emotional range. He was awarded the Oscar for best actor posthumously due to his untimely death just weeks before the Academy Award shoe in 1977. Each of the main characters has a moment where they display a histrionic tirade including Robert Duvall and Ned Beatty, despite his brief screen time. Lofty speeches with moralistic underpinnings are frequent throughout the plot. It's as if you are watching a Shakespeare or Ibsen play. It may be a feel a bit over the top, but it's done well and the plot never lags. Black comedies had their inception in the 1970's and I think this may be due to our country's growing cynicism and deteriorating faith in the system. But whatever the cause may be, Sidney Lumet's direction and Chayefsky's screenplay get it right for the most part. It is also true to say this film was prescient in its dismal view on society; we see many exploitative forms of entertainment today that are similar in principle as the ones shown in Network. Although this movie uses hyperbole the concept is credible. I am incredulous to the notion that a Program would collude with a Terrorist group for the sake of boosting ratings. I'm certain that couldn't fly for it would be too problematic in our country where law and order would have to intervene. After 40 years Network is still relevant and can be extrapolated to how we view TV today which can make us so mad that we can't take it anymore!",Network
153,arthera09,everything anyone would want from a movie,10,8 March 2008,"I loved this movie. It totally blew me away. My roommate recommended it and it was beyond amazing. The writing perfect and just created a world that was utterly insane, but more real than a lot worlds created by the movie industry. The whole world of network television is just put in another light when watching this movie. I was not alive for the heyday of network news, but it had to be so much better than it is today. Watching current news programs it is exactly like watching the Howard Beale show. It was scary and sad, but still managed to be funny. Funny in an uncomfortable way. There are a lot of layers to this movie and I have only watched it once, but I am sure a lot more would be revealed as I watched it again. First of all lets comment on the acting. Top notch and I see how so many Oscars were given out. At first Faye Dunaway's performance seemed too flat, but by the end of the movie one sees why it was acted like it was and it was perfect. The perfect tragic figure that did not change and did not learn a lesson just because it was easier for her to continue her life like she always have even knowing it was wrong and would never give her happiness. Nothing needs to be said about Peter Finch's performance except wow. The next performance that stood out was Ned Beatty and his whole scene was film perfection. As he starts his speech to Beale the shot is perfectly crafted and even being such a small spot on the screen he fills and it and gives a damn memorable speech that almost evokes Emerson (maybe not in tone so much, but it was still there). As he calms down the camera moves in, but he is no less engaging. I like how they managed, perhaps by accident, able to convey the racism of the time and in the media. The fact that the movie started out as a movie about a news network and managed to turn them into terrorists and murders in such a short period of time was amazing. The directing was amazing, but with such a good script and with such quality actors it cannot be hard to make such a masterpiece. Not to belittle with Lumet did because he made the movie from the start feel flat and by the end of the movie made it perfect. the best part of the movie was the writing. Top notch writing and one of the better scripts I have encountered in a while. I am going to seek out more of his movies and see what else this guy is capable of. Overall a brilliant movie and I probably go on about how it was perfect. I am not sure I can think of a bad thing about this movie.",Network

""Beauty"", ""Shakespeare in Love"", ""The Silence of the Lambs"" won when they deserved, but the Oscar was very unfair to films like ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Network"". This one won best actor, actress, supporting actress and screenplay, but why not best picture? Well, ""Rocky"" won that year but, if the masterful ""Taxi Driver"" was almost forgotten, the equally excellent ""Network"" should have won. Do you want some reasons? 1- It is one of the most sarcastic, darkest comedies ever made.2- It is brilliantly acted, with amazing performances of Faye Dunaway, William Holden and Peter Finch.3- The screenplay is one of the best ever written, mixing very well dark comedy and personal dramas.4- It discusses some main subjects, as ethics, and makes an acid critic to the TV.5- It doesn't only care about this, but also to each character. Each one is very well developed, with his/her own problems.6- The film is profetic. It's more realistic than ever in our days.7- It keeps suspense about the destiny of the characters, with a very precise narration.8- The direction of Sidney Lumet is more than a high quality direction.9- It has one of the best movie quotes ever: ""I'm mad as hell, and I won't take this any more!""10- The ending is just... great! Unpredictable and surprising!

You could not ask for better acting!! The acting in this movie is second to none!! Robert Duvall, William Holden, Faye Dunaway, Peter Finch, Ned Beatty and a whole list of others...Perhaps the best acting in any film made whatsoever!! It starts with Howard Beale (Peter Finch) a victim of his own human pitfalls...Ossified and dejected from his declining years going from bad to worse, he becomes isolated, desultory ,morbid and morose and feels his life has no meaning, he threatens suicide on live television and is discarded as being a wacko!!...At first!!..but guess what!! he's a hit!!...So the ratings crazed cutthroats make him an instant success by labeling him ""The Angry Prophet Denouncing the Hypocracies of Our Time""...As long as we've gone this far, let's break all of the rules...Bring on the terrorists, the soothsayers, the insurectionaries, the financial gurus, the faith healers, and the para military radicals, to reduce the severity of hard bitten news to a side show of carnival freaks!!! William Holden plays the old school business man with ""primal doubts"" about his life in general...""male menopause"" with ""defineable features"" He is happily married yet after being bombarded from all sides in the autumn of his years, he is frightened that the new generation is impervious to basic tenets of human morality such as ethics and compassion...The woman with whom he gets involved, is callous not because she is vindictive, but because she is emotionless!! This woman (Faye Dunaway) is the ""Television Incarnate"" Ice Queen who reduces time and space to ""split seconds and instant replays"" the daily business of life is a ""corrupt comedy"" and the only redeeming quality to modern marvels and a ""radiant eruption of Democracy"" is that it gets a 32 share!!...This acting performance is perhaps the best acting performance I have ever seen...The type of person Dianna Christensen was supposed to be was played out perfectly...The delivery of the elaborated monologues and diatribes were absolutely remarkable....She was ideologically explosive yet person-ably obtuse. You knew why she wasn't the drinking type...she was too emotionally detached...In the thick of women's liberation, whereby a woman wanted to be just like a man, this movie portrayed how being just like a man had it's drawbacks!! ""Arousing quickly, consummating prematurely"" and suffering from the cumbersome fate of being crippled by ineptitude at everything else but your work, made Dianna Christensen perennially wistful of testosterone laden aggression!! Aggregately, she invoked societal demise through channels of deductive reasoning!! Director, Sidney Lummet, was insistent that Dianna Christensen be utterly devoid of vulnerability!! Mr Hackett (Robert Duvall) played the hatchet man for the CCA...A rough around the edges errand boy for Mr Jensen (Ned Beatty) who viewed this network as his big chance and that whatever worked worked ..Scruples were never an issue, and ratings were pending exchange!! Howard Beale (Peter Finch) the ""Angry prophet denouncing the hypocrisies of our time"" surprised even himself with his charismatic clout with the naive television audience!!! He was the UBS star-lighted ""Mad Prophet of the airways""...He could arouse anger and counter-culture overzealousness just by appearing crazy!!! One speech Mr Jensen (Ned Beatty) was a bit role but incredibly powerful in his delivery of the basic concept that ideology is for sale and that television is the ultimate vehicle for manipulation!! Paddy Chayefsky is pioneer with this film as an acrimonious depiction for making world phenomena such as the fall of Communism and landing man on the moon to be minimized to a market share!!!..The terms entertainment and egalitarianism now became pejorative!!!! The movie audience is hit with the terrifying reality that a societal caprice will induce the avaricious to capitulate to human catastrophe...Give Paddy Chayefsky and Sidney Lummet credit for unveiling the revelation that ratings and the dollar take precedence over humanity!!! Howard Beale, the decrepit alcoholic, euphemistically transformed to the prescient paragon of intuitiveness, was alright so long as his innocuous chastisements did not disrupt worldwide pecuniary acquisitions!! Once they did, he was quelled, and thus deemed a total ratings chart disaster!! Ultimately, Howard Beale, the once disheveled dipsomania-cal curmudgeon, turned Messianic Savonarola, becomes the typification of the corporate guinea pig!!!!This movie is avant-garde in it's ability to convey the message of greed first democracy second, or third, depending on the sponsors of the Howard Beale Show... An incident was determined traumatic or not traumatic by it's lucrative marketability potential!! Terrorism is not terrorism if it means ratings!!! The character assassination of all the people in this movie was at the grass roots level!! Their avoidable flaws were entrenched as irreconcilable!! Any people with any conscience whatsoever (William Holden & his wife) were decimated by reveille with selfishness, now it is imperative that they pick up the pieces!! How many imitations of this movie have there been...thousands!! Network however was the first movie of it's kind to effectively portray the concept of ""dying Democracy and dehumanization"" probably the best movie of it's kind as well... This is an illustration of how heinous tragedy has to be stomached by the television audience, their response to clinical trauma transcends the impact suffered by the actual victims involved!! It is a proverbial case of ratings eclipsing reality!! The film ""Network"" resonates itself to a point whereby the American people are reduced to meager by-products of the Fortune 500!! I wish there could be a movie of this caliber made again!! I am angry that there has not been a sensationalistic masterpiece to come around for some time, and I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!!!",Network

Protests about racial discrimination; 3. Protests against testing nuclear weapons; 4. Protests about a crooked President; 5. Protests about environmental destruction. This show is also a protest, not about any particular thing, but about the bringer of ill tidings: TV. It implicitly longs for a simpler time when we could just plow a field, toss down a few seeds, and spend our evenings reading verses from the family Bible by our kerosene lamp. This movie, like all melodrama, requires a villain. Is it the bellowing network chairman (Ned Beatty), the cold-hearted chief (Robert Duvall), or the ambitious female programmer (Faye Dunaway), adept at sex but incapable of true love? We can count on the hero (William Holden) to point the finger at the guilty party before the utterly preposterous conclusion. The WGA decided that this was the tenth greatest screenplay in the history of cinema, which tells all we need to know about the WGA and the people writing for big bucks in Tinseltown. The AFI decided that this was 64th among the 100 greatest American films, which tells us all we need to know about the AFI and movie experts in general.

It won a slew of awards, including Peter Finch's best actor Oscar for his portrayal as Howard Beale ""The Prophet of The Airwaves"", which was the first acting Oscar ever awarded posthumously.The movie comes across as satirical, however according to Sidney Lumet, and Paddy Chayefsky, it is anything but. The themes explored are if anything more relevant now in 2019 than they ever were in the 1970's.A TV Station exploiting the public meltdown of a man for improved TV ratings, creating reality TV shows which aren't 100% real, the concept of ""truth"" being a flexible term.Most importantly it hits on two key notes in my opinion, both of them painfully true. The idea that the average person is fed up with the status quo, and that they will listen to and believe almost anything they are told. ""Why me?"" asks Howard Beale, ""because you're on TV dummy"" comes the reply.The performances of the core cast members, Robert Duvall, Peter Finch, Faye Dunaway and William Holden are very strong, all portraying their particular tv execs with unique egotism, which pulls you into believing this is how a station operates. Beatrice Straight should get a mention for putting in an incredibly powerful scene as the wronged wife of Holden's TV exec Max Schumacher.At times the story feels a little light and lacks a bit of depth, with key scenes moving along a little faster than they should.

162,wandereramor,Possibly my favourite movie ever,10,24 August 2011,"This is a movie that works on so many levels. Even on the surface it's an amazing film -- alternately funny and moving, with a lot of incredible dialogue and great acting. It's also, as many others have noted, extremely prescient -- the kind of angry news-entertainment that now dominates the cable airwaves seems like a direct descendant of Howard Beale. But on a deeper level it's a profoundly pessimistic but undeniable statement about how television has infiltrated our psyches, making us real people always trying to be like an artificial character. This isn't just a condemnation of TV -- it's a condemnation of fiction in itself.Some people have complained that the film has too many monologues, but I think that's precisely the point. This is the only way people can communicate in Network -- through dramatics, not genuine personal interaction. The monologue is a device of fiction, and it's tainted everyone. Consider the scene towards the end, where Max leaves Diana. He acts as though he's abandoning the artificiality of television for genuine human interaction, but he's doing so in the mode of TV -- the extensive monologue, leaving her at the end just as she said would make a great end to the TV movie that is their relationship. Consider also the in-movie crowd's response to Beale's angry rants -- applause, treating it as just entertaining theatrics and not really heeding the meaning, just as we the real audience are doing. This is a film that implicates itself, its audience, its medium, and the entire culture that produced it in a vast swamp of artificiality. Its critique is indelible, and I'm still trying to work through it. This is what makes a truly great film -- one that changes the way you look at the world.",Network

Just remember when you watch it, this was 1976. 1976 for God's sake! I remember it creating a stir at the time, but could anyone have realized how astonishingly prescient Paddy Chayefsky's brilliant script was?You've probably read the plot outline a dozen times, so I won't go into too much detail. Peter Finch plays Howard Beale, a middle-aged newsreader who is sacked after a long stint with a floundering network. Teetering on the brink of a breakdown he announces on air that he will blow his brains out live to air in two weeks time. At the same time, Faye Dunaway, playing a scarcely less psychotic executive who has the idea of a weekly reality show following the exploits of a terrorist group latches onto the idea of exploiting Beale's mania to boost their flagging ratings... and then things just get crazy.the number of quotable lines from 'Network' is almost without limit. Duvall, Dunaway and Holden are all great. So is the rest of the cast, right down to the extras. Peter Finch is riveting as Beale.There is plenty of satire, too. The scene where a bunch of TV exec's are sitting down trying to negotiate distribution and payments for the 'Mao Tse Tung Hour' with a group of black Marxist terrorists is hilarious.This movie should be taught in schools, and probably is. Amazing stuff.",Network
164,stp43,"Brilliantly-Presented, Albiet Mildly Flawed, Satire",9,18 August 2003,"Warning - spoilers.Network was Sidney Aaron ""Paddy"" Chayefsky's social satire on the power of television, and in its presentation the film is superb.  The script's power is aided by the energy of the cast, from William Holden, Faye Dunaway, Peter Finch in the role that won him an Oscar he would not live to receive, and Robert Duvall on down.The story revolves around Howard Beale, an anchor for the ""lost"" fourth US TV network Union Broadcasting Systems.  Reportedly based on Edward R. Murrow, Beale is alcoholic and has been driven mad by the events in his life in the 1970s decade to the point of the film's beginning, the late autumn of 1975.  He is fired and in a drunken stupor tells his friend Max Schumacher (William Holden) he intends to commit public suicide on air.  When he makes this annoucement, his world starts to turn upside down along with that of UBS, which sees ratings for its network news show suddenly perk up.They increase even more when Beale goes on air to make a public apology that turns into a vulgar rambling gripe about life, one that costs max Schumacher, in charge of the news division, his job at UBS (having allowed it to go on to get even with UBS for growing interference from the network's owner, Communication Corporation of America), and one that jumps the show's ratings so fast it makes programming head Diana Christenson (Faye Dunaway in the only role I can particularly tolerate from her) start ODing on her own power.Beale's ratings help max get his job back, but after a few more Beale spiels on-air, Beale disappears, and when a furious Max refuses to put him back on the air, seeing he has literally lost control of himself and needs help, he is fired once again, before Howard sneaks back to the set and delivers his maddest rant yet, imploring people to shout out to the world how angry they are.Here the film's satire begins to become flawed.  While the power of TV is undeniable, it is exaggerated here, as mobs of people shouting like well-drilled illiterates because a TV newscaster implores them to grossly undersells the intelligence of the audience.  Also flawed is Diana Christenson's pet project of getting a terrorist group obviously modeled after Patty Hearst and the Symbionese Liberation Army airtime on UBS, though the scene where the network fights with the terrorist group over residuals and syndication rights etc. is quite funny.More plausible, though not necessarily that much, is the film's signature scene, the one that spells the beginning of the end of Howard Beale - when he gets his own TV show (which Keith Olbermann modeled his own brief late-Sunday evening show on FOX Sports after, right down to the Peter Finch photo on his desk) he makes raving speeches to the studio audience, and his ratings are enormous.  But then one fateful day he warns that CCA has been purchased by a consortium of banks financed by Saudi Arabia.  Beale's speech devolves into a rant about foreign ownership of US companies that has been a hallmark attitude of ""populist"" activists but which has always been exaggerated inits effect.  Beale's rant causes a stampede of letters demanding the deal be aborted, even though Saudi Arabia ownes every ledger UBS and CCA have.CCA's chief, Arthur Jensen, gets Beale for himself and delivers his own speech about how corporations are the real governments of the times.  Once again Chayefsky goes overboard on his satire, as corporations then and now do not command close to the power the film implies, and Beale's speeches now become self-loathing sobs without fire, and his show's ratings deteriorate, and with it deteriorates Diana Christenson's life and her relationship with Max.  It also plants the seeds for the final ending of Howard Beale at the climax, an implausible act of violence that actually works in the context of the film but which is not that believeable in any realworld context.Plausibilities aside, the film makes its point and does so with such power that it is easy to forget the gaps in logic that exist within.  The performances all around are superior, the cinematography by Owen Roizman effectively atmospheric, and the dialogue strikingly effective.",Network
165,punisherversion1,Prophetic dark comedy,8,20 September 2018,"Network
Directed by Sidney Lumet and written by Paddy ChayefskyThis movie comes as a recommendation by James Staggs. This film comes with the reputation of being a prophetic film. It does seem eerily prescient when it comes to a ranting, raving man spouting on the ills of the world. I imagine this guy being on Fox News telling everyone how the secret elite is running things and playing on the anger and fears of the common folks. This is just a small portion of the narrative. It has a corporation taking over a news division and turning it into a tabloid circus. That sound familiar. The world we live in now seems like it came from this like the writer had a crystal ball. I know that many people have probably said that about this movie. It's very true. Now this movie is still a satire. It is a lyrical satire. The dialogue flows like poetry. There are several scenes that are two people going back and forth with their ideas about shifting the perspective of news. They find a way to play on people's emotions. It is no longer about the facts as if it ever was. It is now firmly in the camp of editorials, soothsayers and pseudoscience. It's presented as a circus. Everything becomes for profit. A man's mental well being is up for ratings. The main reason I still consider this a satire even though it reflects a lot of our times, the people are not really people in this. They are constructs of ideals. They speak in poetic flowing tones. The tete a tete between the former producer and the new producer who start to see each other is beautifully written and just sounds like music to your ears.I read somewhere that Aaron Sorkin considers this film to be a major inspiration on his writing and it shows. The Newsroom has a lot of these vocal patterns to them. They speak in a certain rhythm that is like music to your ears. The characters are over the top, almost like cartoon characters. You can enjoy it from a distance. I did enjoy it from that distance. I chuckled at the outrageous ideals and then felt that ping of uncomfortable pain that comes from knowing how true this is now. I really got some kicks from this film. It was a really well done dark comedy. It has superb performances playing caricatures and having the movie recognize this before such a thing was really in play was golden. I recommend giving this one a watch. I give it a B.",Network

It does get stuck in your head no matter how many times you watch the film, and it appeals to a lot of people.But a lot of people forget- and a lot of people who only know the film from that one quote simply don't know- that this quote was said by a news anchor who had, to put it lightly, gone insane and was being exploited by his news team. It's strange how a limited sample can skew one's perspective. But it is not nearly as strange as some of the going-ons in this film.There are some movies that stay them same as they age. There are some movies that get worse. But only a select few get better; and this is one of them. At the time, it was a piercing satire of what was happening within the world of television. Now, it is something far more powerful: a piercing satire of what has happened within the world of television. IT no longer deals with the cutting edge or the hypothetical. If this movies came out today, it would be more timely than half of the standard studio output.The television studios in this are cutthroat, caring about nothing but the ratings. If they can pull a 20 share, they will put anything on the air. They will showcase the ramblings of a man who has clearly gone insane and should be getting psychiatric help. They will broadcast the endeavors of communist terrorists. The only thing they will not do is allow anyone to insult the business arm of the company.I know not if these ideas seemed outrageous in the mid-70's, but I do know that they are not outrageous now. This is the kind of stiff that makes me glad television is slowly dying.There is one character who starts off opposing the big corporations and their backhanded deals, but by the end of the film, she is right in their back pockets. Witnessing this complete turn, I started to realize how depressing this film is. It is not depressing in the typical way; this is not Requiem for a Dream (love that title, by the way). No, it is depressing because it is probably one of if not the most cynical movies I have ever seen. If this were done with incompetent hands, it would be whiny and adolescent. But under the masterful hands of Sidney Lumet, who also directed 12 Angry Men, it becomes a deep, piercing bullet of satire.If nothing else, Peter Finch's performance as the newsman-gone-mad makes this whole film worth it. There is a reason that he got the first posthumous Oscar. This gives the film as a whole more heft; since he is so convincing, you see how useful he is to the networks, and become more immersed in the tragedy of all that is happening.There are millions of people like me who, whether they realize it or not, want to see a film like this done this well.

The network hires the anchor and uses the incident and his eccentric behavior to increase their TRP ratings. Over all the story is about dehumanization of a common man and herd mentality.'Network' is an idea based film. Lots of things are interesting but film lacks the element of surprise. Characters are very stale and predictable. Film assumes that everyone is bad and deranged. Although some of the scenes are nice and direction is good film doesn't say much. May be the reason is that we already know that for our society everything is just 'Success' and 'Failure' and so it really didn't amuse me that much. Duration of the film is a little longer than required. It could have been squeezed to 85-90 minutes easily. Corporate meeting scenes are longish and are just too stale. It would have been much better to make a comedy based on this idea rather than a serious satire. For example 'The Truman Show' worked really well with all the surprises and little humor.

I don't throw around the term ""important movie"" loosely -- but this one is. Notice the tag line: ""Television will never be the same""? Yeahright. In fact, television in general, and television news in particular, have become MUCH MORE the cynical, amoral, profit-driven media portrayed in ""Network"" than they were in 1976. Along with ""1000 Clowns,"" this one tantalizes us with the possibility that everybody will get up of their sofas, throw open their windows, and shout, ""I'm mad a hell..."" or ""Everybody down in the street for volleyball,"" or SOMETHING, ANYTHING other than, ""Where's the remote?"" or ""Honey could you get me a beer?""

Certainly the concept of a rightwing-controlled corporate media, which cares more about ratings and sponsorship dollars than delivering the truth to viewers, crossed the minds of Nixon pals like Roger Ailes and Ronald Reagan, who in 1976 were still reeling from the downfall of their hero, and which to this day is blamed by a certain segment of the U. S. population as being ""part of an agenda,"" as opposed to blaming Nixon and his cronies for their own criminal wrongdoings...but I digress. Ailes and Reagan eliminated the FCC Fairness Doctrine in the final year of the Reagan Presidency in 1987, and that coupled with the Telecom Act of 1996 brought the ""news"" outlet depicted as UBS in this movie to the living rooms of every American, as part of a basic cable package.There are so many moments in the screenplay and the movie itself that viewers interested in truth versus sensationalism in the news will nod their heads in complete agreement to. The top-level UBS execs eating their Caesar salads and plotting the then-unthinkable (disowning legitimate news in favor of more ratings-friendly sensationalism) is just one example. Robert Duvall is amazing in this movie, as a corporation loyalist brought in to UBS to wreck all kinds of havoc. Duvall later stated in interviews that he played Frank Hackett (rhymes with ""hatchet..."") as a ""vicious President Ford."" Faye Dunaway is his equal as a woman so dominated by television that she can't even participate in a weekend fling with her married lover Max Schumacher (played by sad-eyed William Holden) without constantly jabbering about programming, ratings, corporate sponsorship, and the fall's new lineup featuring such sensationalistic soap operas like ""The Dykes.""Holden's Schumacher represents the ""old school"" (now ""VERY old school"") side of investigative, fact-finding journalism, personified by the likes of Ed Murrow, Walter Cronkite, and the original 60 Minutes gang. And yes, there was a time when American viewers really cared about the truth and uncovering facts and exposing corporate scandals. Before corporate-controlled 60 Minutes offered such groundbreaking segments on cross dressers in Japan and the Kardashian family, the program, in its heyday of the 1970s and '80s, cut to the core of the truth and exposed corruption - and was the top show in the Nielson ratings week after week. This was before the two aforementioned items of 1987 and 1996 changed the landscape permanently. Now, cable entertainment networks claiming to be news can truly ""make or break Presidents,"" as Howard Beale himself claims during one of his rants.There is not one subpar performance in this film. Beatrice Straight won an Oscar for an 8-minute performance--I dare anyone to watch this performance as Schumacher's suffering wife without tearing up. And Ned Beatty - much has already been said about his ""the world is a corporation"" lecture to Beale, and it gets more fitting by the year. Look for a very young Lance Henrikson in his second suit and tie Sidney Lumet film (following ""Dog Day Afternoon"") and Tim Robbins as one of the followers of the ""Great Ahmed Khan,"" a Black Panther type who collides with Howard Beale in one of the greatest film endings in Hollywood history.A must-watch.",Network

The new God, Jensen, reveals to his prophet, Beale, this ""evangel"" to deliver to the people via television. This is a film about corruption of all human associations - religious, political, corporate, marital. Humans are just ""humanoids."" Allegiance to some multi-national corporation is far more important than allegiance to some complacent, ineffectual government - or to the real God. ""Network"" is simply the specific environment that Chayefsky uses to show this corruption; and Beale, Christensen, Schumacher, Hackett et al are merely the specific ""humanoids"" chosen as variant examples. Television is both the least significant end of this corruption (not ""actual, real living"") and its most significant means of perpetration on humanity (""because you reach 50 million people, you idiot!""). This is 1984, written from a later perspective than Orwell's. Keenly perceptive of 1976? Absolutely! Prophetic of 2008 - and beyond? No question.The only reason OPEC doesn't raise precipitously the price of oil to $200/bbl is because too many petro-dollars are invested in the West. Its collapse would also bring down the OPEC countries, themselves. The national debt of the U.S. is so great that over half of the annual budget goes to banks - not to amortize the debt, but just to pay interest! Americans don't own our country any more (and haven't for a long time); WE RENT IT.That Chayefsky and Lumet and Co. could actually film this statement of unadulterated TRUTH in the first place is astonishing.

174,Criticalstaff,Maybe the best satire ever,9,18 August 2020,"I have watched this movie twice already, and I enjoyed it both times. The first time I was floored by the prescience of the movie and the overall exposé on TV-media it does. The second time I enjoyed the less obvious stuff. The second time I enjoyed how almost every scene takes place in those Manhattan office buildings. It is cute; nowadays no-one ever shoots outside a blue-screen.It is roundabout way to say that I appreciated the office politics a lot more this time. It is kind of funny that the whole movie's premise hinges on coincidences like one guy getting fired and the other one being in the hospital. However, broadly speaking it is also a way for it to comment on the corporatist takeover of America. Obviously it is very caricatured, as is the rest of the movie, but it does give the movie something else to play with.All the events of the movie are set in motion by the corporate chess-game Duvall, and indirectly Dunaway, are engaged in. I think this time around my favourite scene, was Duvall's rant in tuxedo realizing his ambitions are crashing down. Duvall is the antagonist of the movie, but he is so transparent in his love for money it is hard to really hate the guy. Of course, his main motivation is to please the Jupiterian Mr.Jensen. And it is kind of fun to see that for all the power he wields, and all the decisions that affect other people's lives he takes, he himself is also subject to capricious gods.Dunaway plays a far more clever character. One that is charming and ruthless. She plays almost everyone like a goddam fiddle, and it is only Max Schumacher at the end who is lucid enough to see through her. She become almost a kind of Shakesperean figure, the driven genius who is unable to connect with anyone. She is capable of tricking these men but she unable to love them. She is building an empire but she ends desperately alone.Of course, the movie treats all of this as a farce. It sets up these tragic figures to laugh at them and their short-sighted ambitions, not to pity them. The movie has also a romantic subplot, but it does not really play into the main plot. I feel it is only threre to highlight Dunaway's character and motivations. Yet it gives a bit of personality and humanity to a film that is somewhat removed from reality.In essence, the movie's main argument is that network TV will sacrifice their News departments driven by truth committed to facts for sensationalism and entertainment. Sacrifice journalistic integrity for ratings.
Of course, it is in a way what happened since the movie came out. It is equally fascinating and horrifying. The irony of course, is when the movie came out it was considered as wild satire, now it seems merely descriptive.",Network

176,Putzberger,"We Have Seen the Future, And It Sucks",10,28 December 2005,"This movie came out when I was nine years old, and I saw it on network TV the following year, lured by the brouhaha that surrounded the use of the ""barnyard epithet"" during prime time. I loved this movie before I understood it, and I worship it now. Like ""Elmer Gantry"" or ""1984,"" it's a work of didactic art that only fails on an imaginative level -- Sinclair Lewis couldn't grasp how debased evangelism would become, Orwell couldn't foresee the excesses of Mao or Pol Pot, and Chayevsky couldn't envision the absolute decline of television from a vast wasteland to a malevolent sewer. Fox News, reality TV, even the OJ chase, ""Network"" anticipates every vile bit of it.Now, it's ridiculously overwritten -- NO ONE is as articulate as the characters in this film, and most certainly, no one who works in television is as literate as Diana Christensen (the Faye Dunaway character). I doubt that poet laureates or even Eminem could spew as witty an aside as ""muttering mutilated Marxism."" But damn if that isn't part of its charm. Plus, outside of Max Schumacher (William Holden), the characters are pretty much archetypes instead of real people (the Robert Duvall character might as well wear a black cape and top hat), but their two-dimensionality works as a good metaphor for Max's seduction into the ""shrieking nothingness"" or television. Plus the actors are so superb they make screeching caricatures into almost-sympathetic characters: Duvall is a credible and charismatic villain, Finch is a fine mad prophet and Faye Dunaway manages to make a shrill, manipulative, soulless neurotic so damn cute and sexy you'll want to leave your wife for her, too, just as long as she promises to keep sitting cross-legged on your desk and hitching up her skirt. (Therein lies the real eroticism, forget the intentionally mechanical, unerotic coupling later in the flick).

It takes on the government, mass media, suicide and terrorism, all with a grin. It's the darkest of dark comedies. It's so dark it can hardly be considered a comedy. The film is ""Network"" and it is 25 years old. The relevance of this film to today's society is frightening. For the time it was made, American cynicism toward government was at an all-time high. ""Network"" must be a response to the shocking TV Americans suddenly found themselves subject to-first the news coverage of Vietnam, then Watergate. Suddenly the war was in your living room, and you felt a duty to watch it. The news media was (and still is) on a determined quest for truth and you felt an obligation to hear what they had to say from one day to the next. This film dealt with the public's perception of the news media as it had evolved up until that time. The film's creators could see how the lines were beginning to blur between news and entertainment. The reality-based, shocking material seemed to draw the highest ratings. The network of `Network' goes so far as to support the terrorism it is reporting.There is a more historic context for this kind of news-for-money tactic. William Randolph Hearst invented news to sell newspapers. His ""yellow journalism"" conjured the 1898 Spanish-American War. Hearst's newspapers published cruel editorials on President William McKinley-months before McKinley was assassinated.  Can there be any doubt that ""Network"" was inspired by both sides of the Hearst coin--mistrust of the government AND mistrust of the news media?Was this the advent of 'reality TV?' Was this film anticipating the news-starved world we live in today? ""Network"" is an example of a film that would be impossible to get made today. The greatest films are documents of their times, but are also prophecies, containing decades-spanning, enduring truths. This film is both.",Network

It can be fascinating to see how much has changed since the time it was made, and how much has stayed relevant. Despite being made almost 40 years ago, ""Network"" is a scary depiction of today's television, with many things similar to those originally meant as satire now present in our TV schedules.The main character of the film is Howard Beale, played brilliantly by Peter Finch, a news anchor who has a breakdown live on air after he is fired. Beale's breakdown is then exploited by the network, who keep him on the air in order to take advantage of the high ratings caused by his rant. He is then employed, following the iconic and magnificent ""mad as hell"" speech, as a TV preacher broadcasting his rants to the masses. Finch's performance shows us clearly that he is mentally unstable, and makes the network's actions even more atrocious. Features in Beale's show, such as the psychic who predicts the week's news, must have seemed absurd at the time, but now seem all to real.Of the other great performances in the film, my favourite is that of Faye Dunaway, who plays a ridiculous network executive. Once again, the suggestions for controversial television shows that she has may seem ridiculous at the time (""The Mao Tse-Tung Hour"" would definitely have seemed to be one of the most ridiculous TV concepts ever), but would definitely fit in well in one of the cable channels we have now. Sidney Lumet has a good vision for the film, having worked extensively in television, and the sequence during Beale's speech when we see people shouting on the streets is particularly great. The script is also extremely sharp throughout, and the biting satire is witty, if not laugh-out-loud funny. It's a comedy that requires you to think, but is rewarding when you do.I do, however, have a few issues with the film. It's too long, and not enough happens to justify its 2 hour running time. The film feels like it could have been shortened a bit, and while a lot of the satire is still very current, some of it now feels slightly dated. It is still very enjoyable for the majority of that time, and you end up feeling very sorry for Howard Beale, especially when he is brought down all for the sake of the ratings.",Network

184,varundelpiero,Intelligent and timeless satire...,9,25 November 2008,"Sidney Lumet's NETWORK is where great ensemble acting meets intelligent and provocative writing. Enough said. There is no reason to miss this Motion Picture, as its messages remain true even 32 years after its release, and even more so now that television news stations are more popular and sensational than ever. NETWORK works on so many levels that it is difficult to convey; it is a satirical piece dealing with the impact of television on audiences, and the lengths that major networks would go to in order to gain higher ratings. NETWORK also works as a dark and brooding comedy, with little to laugh aloud at, but a lot for the more intellectual viewer to chuckle at while pondering the meaning of some of the events.Sidney Lumet assembles an all-star cast, and more importantly, manages to draw an all-star performance from his actors/actresses. It is no surprise that this film garnered five acting nominations at the Oscars, and in my opinion, there were a couple more that could have been included. Peter Finch delivers the performance of a lifetime, as does Faye Dunaway, and they both deserved their wins (Finch's was posthumous). It was unfortunate that William Holden had to compete against Finch for the Best Actor prize, because Holden's performance was easily the second best of the year, and deserved some accolade. Ned Beatty also received a nomination, but the real surprise was Beatrice Straight's nomination and victory. I say surprise because her name wasn't really being bandied about, but after watching the scene where her character confronts her husband, it is difficult to think of a more brutally honest and heart-wrenching female performance from that year.Sidney Lumet was nominated for Best Director, as was NETWORK for Best Picture, but the film lost in both categories to the John Avildsen's excellent and iconic ROCKY. Deservedly, though, NETWORK managed to walk away with the Best Original Screenplay statuette, for a script that was honest, intelligent, brilliant, and timeless, and contains a number of smart and outstanding quotes that are still applicable in today's society.Like I said, NETWORK is not to be missed. If your life has been influence by television in any way, you owe it to yourself to look at this one; I bet you won't be able to watch it just once. It is a fast-paced, frank, and clever breakdown of the technological and social marvel that is network television, and one of the few films (and perhaps the best) to examine the relationship between news and entertainment; truly a film way ahead of its time.NETWORK gets 4 stars (out of 4) and 9/10.

Yet his trusted colleagues at his network don't see this as an area of concern, but rather a business opportunity. The producers exploit this reporter's state of mind to give him his own show in which he furiously preaches the flaws of society, promoting his viewers to shout of their window, 'I'm mad as hell and I'm not guna take it!'. However, the show's ratings start to falter and the network need to find some way of bringing down the show, no matter how extreme...Network reveals a shocking reality that the television business (or rather the media overall) is evil, partial and false. The peek of satire in the film is Faye Dunaway's character, Diana Christensen. She claims to be inept at everything except her work, she is engrossed in the falseness of the media which influences her own life in which she compares affairs with Vronsky and Anna in 'Anna Karenina' and sees mundane situations as a script.Finch's performance as Howard Beale was powerful and boundlessly brilliant. He acts as the messenger of truth in the film, a beacon of light in this dark abyss of lies and hypocrisy.

187,canadude,Media Under Attack (yet again [for the first time]),7,23 May 2004,"""Network"" may have been a popular film, a film thought to be as real as it gets. This is a story of a man gone mad and exploited by Network TV; a classic story about the evil media and big corporations thirsty for money via ratings. But ""Network"" has aged and so has its message. Yes, it's a well done film. Sidney Lumet knows, and I think few will doubt this, how to direct. The performances are great, though I'm amazed that Holden didn't win an Oscar, while the ever-annoying Faye Dunaway did. Dunaway's performance, though in my assessment not marred by the empty, selfish character she plays, is lost and confused and simply fake. I didn't find her believable. And of course Peter Finch is great as the TV prophet whose descent into insanity is marketed by the Network.The film is a satire. The story is interesting though it has been done over and over again - I've seen more movies about Media exploitation than I have about the Holocaust or other world events. Talk about Film exploiting Media. Still, it's one of the first and hence it was so popular. But is it good? Well, it's got a great script. It's so literary and witty and teeming with colorful adjectives. And it's also loud, sometimes irritating and in the end jumps to an improbable conclusion. Several improbable conclusions.Consider the final scene between Holden and Dunaway. Paddy Chayefsky's words, the screenwriter, present him as a man who has been burned by a relationship with a career-oriented woman who doesn't have time for the emotions of a man. So he has Holden deliver what seems like an eternity of a monologue about the emptiness of Dunaway's character and her madness. Two things: 1) this is already self-explanatory from the beginning of the film rendering this ten-minute redundant harangue a waste of time and 2) Dunaway, who is a hardcore woman and is detached from reality, doesn't respond but listens attentively. Where the hell is the protest? By listening to Holden attentively the script suggests that she isn't as empty as Holden suggests, but rather, there is some deeper connection between their characters. Otherwise she would just kick him out and not get depressed by his words, far less even listen to them.And, while I understand that the goal of any satire is to exaggerate events to comment on reality, the last shots of the film are plain ridiculous. Yes, they fall in line with the film's message, that the media is completely exploitative and we're just sorta fine with that. But it's not grounded in any reality. It's improbable. And that's a severe loss for ""Network."" A satire with a similarly shocking ending, Kubrick's ""Dr. Strangelove,"" succeeds admirably precisely because it makes its improbable ending seem dangerously probable, if not inevitable.""Network"" has a good conscience in mercilessly attempting to portray the cutthroat world of media exploitation. And, despite the ridiculous ending and some dialogue, it's not bad in getting the message across. However, it's just simply nothing new and its theme been explored far better in documentaries like ""Bowling for Columbine"" or fictional films like ""Natural Born Killers."" ""Network"" is, above all else, old.",Network
188,JosephPezzuto,Reel Look: Network,8,30 December 2016,"""I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!"" The scene of the soaking-wet news anchor Howard Beale still remains vivid as he storms into the station in his drenched trench coat and gray matted hair to deliver the best ranted monologue in the film, imploring and begging us in an impassioned tirade that we should not have to take it anymore as his face fills the screen in desperation and urgency. Soon enough, citizens throughout the city of whom have tuned in are yelling the mantra out of their apartment windows at the top of their voices, echoed back by only the thunder and driving rain.Inspired by the 29-year-old television news reporter Christine Chubbuck and her committing suicide during a live broadcast at her Florida station in 1974, American playwright, screenwriter and novelist Paddy Chayefsky decided to take this story of shock and morbidity and write a satirical black comedy-drama to unveil television for what it truly was amidst a post-Watergate America. The script would eventually be lauded as one of the ten greatest screenplays in the history of cinema. This time, Chayefsky's central figure in his story, directed by Sidney Lumet (12 Angry Men, Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon) would not be a young woman but an older man, of whom had probably seen far better days in the business of media. Here was a veteran news anchor, discouraged and on the verge of a mental breakdown, truly fed up with the violent crimes and homicides that surround him on a daily basis while people still passively continue to watch. Is television really to blame for all of the madness even today? Let's take a look.Beale (Peter Finch, the first actor to ever receive a posthumous Oscar) discovers that he's being put out to pasture, and he isn't the least bit happy about it. He then threatens to blow his brains out on live television, after of which he launches into an angry rant that turns out to be a huge ratings boost for the fictional UBS network. Taking full advantage of this stunt, the ambitiously determined producer Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway) desires to turn the network on its head to develop even more outrageous programming (for example, The Mao Tse- Tung Hour for the upcoming fall season). Taking this newfound concept to unsettling extremes for her own personal gain, and when Beale's ratings seem to have topped out, she approaches the president of the news division Max Schumacher (William Holden) to ""develop"" the news show regarding Beale's success. Here too was a weathered news man at the top of whom had seen better days in media but, unlike Beale, remains passive to do anything about the current situations outside the confines of the station. Internally, he does not approve of Beale's manic antics on air but allows him to broadcast reluctantly. He declines the professional offer given by Diana, but not the personal one as the two then begin an affair. Schumacher decides to end Beale as the ""Angry Man"" format, as Christensen convinces her boss, Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall) to slot the evening news show under the entertainment division so that she may develop it. Soon after, Beale is hosting a new program called The Howard Beale Show. Ultimately the show becomes a hit and is the most highly-rated show on television and Beale, as the ""mad prophet of the airwaves"" finds new celebrity preaching his dire diatribes to a live audience when, on cue, chants Beale's catchphrase as one. Behind the scenes, Max and Diana's romance at first withers as the show flourishes. But in the flush of high ratings, the two ultimately find their way back to reuniting. Max decides to leave his wife (Beatrice Straight) of over twenty-five years since Diana has seduced him. But Diana's fanatical devotion to her job and emotional emptiness eventually drives Max back to his wife. Max knows that no one cared about the golden age of television anymore. People only cared about what was hot at the moment, as Beale was it, keeping the network from going under with his wild outbursts regarding present culture. Max takes Beale to meet with CCA chairman Arthur Jensen (Ned Beatty), of whom tells Beale to tone down his rampant speeches. A plot to assassinate Beale live is put into motion due to him preaching Jensen's new ""evangel"" regarding the dehumanization of society, which depresses the masses as ratings begin to slide. What follows is an ending as chilling as it is abrupt, as the plug is harshly pulled from Beale's professional career.Network and its message still remain as powerful today as it did then; a picture truly ahead of its time. The film does not glorify television but opens the viewer's eyes to a better understanding of what it is capable of doing if we allow it to rule our lives by the talking heads on the screen. Post viewing, many may be tempted to just toss the blasted device out into the street, seeing television as just a sleazy corporate parasite vying for our every iota of attention. But we can't look away, because we keep coming back to it just as we always have and will always continue to do so. Even forty years later, the shape, make and model of the television has been altered over time, but the message therein still remains and rings clear the more we tune in to the daily broadcasts and news specials. It's all about the ratings and numbers, of which we are and have become. Madness begets madness, as television only exemplifies what the network executives want us to see. We can get mad, but to whom will that help in bettering an already chaotic society? We can choose, however, how much truth there is behind the static and learn to think rationally and respond reasonably rather than allowing a man-made box with wires to do it for us.",Network
189,pleiades10,"Prophetic for the 70's, realistic for the present day.",7,29 January 2001,"Network is a very good film. Paddy Chayefsky gives us a peek into the depressing world of television corporations, ratings, and buy-outs. Peter Finch plays a newsman who learns he is to be fired after 15 years because his ratings have fallen. Angered, he threatens to commit suicide, in front of millions of viewers on his last day in the UBS news studios. The ratings soar after this revelation, so the sleazy bigwigs (headed by Faye Dunaway) attempt to capitalize on the man's loss of sanity by making the evening news focus on his rants, and eventually, graduating him to a show of his own where he can speak out about everything that's wrong in the world. This too, is a ratings triumph, until the newsman starts to discuss more depressing topics, and the ratings start to fall apart. I now understand why I've heard so much about ""Network"" over the years. The cast does a fine job of portraying the backstabbing world of television hierarchy, and I can see that upon it's release in 1976, it would become such a ""must-see"" film. However, the years have dulled Network's impact, because television REALLY DID get increasingly outrageous as the years passed. I'm not familiar with any show that is quite like Finch's newsman series, but when ""reality programming"" like Survivor, The Real World, Temptation Island and others are the ratings blockbusters of the modern day... well, it seems that Chayefsky may have seen a window into the future to get the idea for Network. Not to mention the idea that when this movie was made, there was only the big THREE networks, and the idea of a fourth was laughable. Yet, ten short years later, the Fox network emerges, broadcasting some of the earliest shows to ""push the envelope"", such as ""Married With Children"", and ""A Current Affair"". Hmmmmm.... 
***SPOILER ALERT!!!! LOOK OUT!!!!****Another interesting note. I noticed a correlation between Network and Warren Beatty's political satire, Bulworth. Both movies feature a main character despondent over his life and role in society until a stimulus ""wakes him up"" and causes him to preach the truth to the masses. As the main character gets increasingly obnoxious and ballsy, he gains millions of fans who hang on his every word. But tragedy strikes, and the main character's life is cut short by a bullet. Now, Peter Finch didn't have Halle Berry to kiss and hug on, and Warren Beatty didn't have to deal with Faye Dunaway manipulating his every move, but the basic plot is strikingly similar. Perhaps Beatty (who directed and wrote Bulworth) has a well worn copy of Network in his movie collection? See them both, and decide for yourself!",Network
190,paul_johnr,At least there's radio,9,11 August 2006,"1976 should make film-goers respect the difficult task carried out by Academy Award voters. Arguably the greatest year in U.S. cinema history fired off 'Network,' 'All the President's Men,' 'Bound for Glory,' 'Taxi Driver,' and eventual winner 'Rocky' as candidates for best picture. That 'Network' was turned down says much about the quality of film on 1976's ballot.However, it says a great deal about 'Network' that the movie won four Oscars, including three by its cast. The film was an ideal project for director Sidney Lumet, with all but one of the leading roles taken by first choice actors and barely any hitches occurring in Network's spawn. Superb performances from the entire cast and Paddy Chayefsky's bold social commentary were a match made in Heaven.Chayefsky, who earned a considerable reputation in stage, film, and television writing, coined up 'Network' as a parable on broadcasting industry trends: Nielsen ratings becoming the wherewithal for a television show's existence, television entering the hands of corporate powerbrokers, and the absolute flattening of integrity for monetary gain. Few realized at the time, however, that 'Network' would slowly transform itself into a parody of the business as it really is. Since 1976, the original playing field of three major television networks has become overcrowded with 'shock' companies like Fox and UPN, hundreds of cable and digital channels, and broadcasting sources on the Internet. Their economic power wearing thin, networks have found themselves desperate for advertising revenue, turning to 'reality' shows, trash journalism, and other venues of socially unacceptable behavior.In 1976, the economic power of television was limited mostly to CBS, ABC, and NBC. In Paddy Chayefsky's semi-fictional America, there exists a fourth network called the Union Broadcasting Systems (UBS), presided over by chairman Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall). UBS ranks fourth in virtually even realm of broadcasting, including its news division. Everything changes overnight, however, when network news anchor Howard Beale (Peter Finch) is sacked for his program's low ratings. One week before a final show, lonely widower Beale announces that he will commit suicide on the air in order to boost UBS's viewership. Needless to say, viewers who were never interested in Beale's program start tuning in and UBS gains free publicity in both newspapers and on competing stations.Jumping right on the situation is programming director Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway), a young opportunist in search of an angle. Through the Beale fiasco, Christensen realizes that TV can be used as a magnet for the rages and vulnerabilities of average Americans, drawing viewers to their sets with outrageous fare. This, of course, means giving Beale his own show for insanity-driven rants ('a latter-day prophet') and creating a wide array of programs on terrorist groups, car crashes, executions, occultism, and sexual transgression. In no time, Christensen has UBS on par with the other three networks and takes almost full control of the company's news division from Max Schumacher (William Holden), subordinating it to a 'for profit' role.Chayefsky, not Beale, should be hailed as a social prophet. Some twenty years in advance, the playwright foresaw a television industry that provides shock treatment like jolts of insulin. Engulfed in a mad scramble for ratings and advertising dollars, television has become an instrument of dementia rather than a means of entertainment. Equally uncanny is the purchase of networks by transnational corporations that want matters told from their own viewpoint, as depicted by Arthur Jensen (Ned Beatty), the chairman of industrial giant CCA who acquires UBS for his own devices.If a film-goer hasn't seen 'Network,' he hasn't seen 1970s cinema at all. The film was snubbed for Best Picture, but still earned three acting Oscars by Finch (posthumously, the first actor to do so), Dunaway, and Beatrice Straight, who played a brief role as Max Schumacher's wife, Louise. Paddy Chayefsky received Network's fourth Oscar for best original screenplay. The film is a perfect balance, with no single element of production carrying it; 'Network' is wonderfully cohesive, from acting to directing to cinematography (Owen Roizman) to editing (Alan Heim) to the Beale theme song (Elliot Lawrence) in an otherwise music-less two hours.The film, which was jointly released by MGM and United Artists under exceptional circumstances, has been reissued in a two-disc special edition by Warner Brothers with help from Turner Entertainment Company (*whew*). Disc one contains 'Network' with optional commentary by Sidney Lumet and the theatrical trailer. The movie and trailer are presented in widescreen with Dolby-enhanced stereo; French 'dubbing' is included with English, French, and Spanish subtitles. Disc two is jam-packed with supplementary material, including a six-part documentary on the making of 'Network,' portions of a Chayefsky interview with Dinah Shore, and a Lumet interview with Robert Osborne on Turner Classic Movie's 'Private Screenings.''Network' is presented with the respect it deserves. The film's video and audio are crystal clear, while the trailer is in fairly good shape with darkness and some visible artifacts. Turner's supplementary items cover all facets of the movie-making process and bring deeper appreciation of Network's filming. Of slight disappointment is Lumet's commentary track, which doesn't go beyond what he already mentions in the documentary and 'Private Screenings' interview. This problem is easily solved by listening to the commentary track before watching the second disc. On all levels, this film is required viewing; a true classic.*** ½ out of 4",Network

Especially today!This is the story of Howard Beale (Peter Finch), the alcoholic, depressed evening news anchor for the struggling UBS Network. He goes off script one evening and announces he's going to kill himself next week on air. This stirs up an enormous amount of crap as you may imagine, but he is allowed back on the air and as his (obvious) mental illness progresses his ratings increase.This is a powerhouse showcase for all the actors involved, but Ned Beatty (as Arthur Jensen) blew me away. He is the epitome of corporate evil! I understand he did all his work on the film in just one day ... and that got him a well-deserved Oscar nomination. Faye Dunaway (as UBS programming director Diana Christensen) depicts a character so loathsome and devoid of -any- redeeming qualities that it must be seen to be believed. And William Holden (as former news director Max Schumacher) is the only character with any moral compass, but even he goes astray.There's also a lot of Meta commentary and self-referential bits involving scripts that the actors are themselves playing out even as they get snarky about it!And there's a hysterical scene involving a business meeting with a terrorist group that has it's own TV show (thanks to Diana)!It's darkly funny (as in pitch-black), enormously cynical, and riveting.HIGHLY Recommended!",Network
192,don2507,Just Who Is Being Satirized in Network?,7,4 July 2017,"Our adult film course recently watched this film and discussed it at length afterwards. The initial reaction is to see Sidney Lumet's and Paddy Chayefsky's Network as a brilliant satire of television news and, more broadly, the television industry, and to that end there's some brilliant writing by Chayefsky. Chayefsky, and Lumet, have to tread lightly with their movie audience because the ultimate target of their merciless satire, whether intentionally or not, is the American public. The 1970s were perhaps the last decade where commercial mass broadcasting via the three networks almost monopolized television viewing in America, and these networks operating as commercial programmers targeted their programming at the mass audience, sometimes viewed as the lowest common denominator. If the ravings of Howard Beale, the newscaster on Network who's having a severe breakdown, earn a ""40 share"", i.e., high ratings, then that's because the public finds him interesting or amusing, and not that they're getting a balanced report of current events. The irony in this movie is that the networks during this period, and previously, pursued the ""lowest common denominator"" in their commercial programming but viewed their newscasts as akin to a public trust without a strong emphasis on profitability. The FCC licenses that conveyed to them slices of the public airwaves required some forms of public service.Among the highlights of the film for me were: (1) the brilliant speeches Chayefsky wrote for some of his characters, (2) the performance of Peter Finch as Howard Beale, the deranged ""anchorman"", who goes on the air ""to make my witness"" and delivers wild, rambling, incoherent speeches to his viewers followed by a physical collapse on the air, and the public loves him, so the programming dept. takes over the newscasts to ensure their high ratings (One might argue that Chayefsky has given Beale some of his disdain for television and his quasi-political paranoia but delivered in the form of a madman's ravings; others might argue that Beale, while clearly unhinged, is making observant points), (3) the amusing situation of radical Marxists, who've been given choice programming slots, arguing like capitalists over their ""distribution rights"", and (4) the production design of the revised newscasts, after they're controlled by the commercial programmers, that have all the trappings of a live variety show.Despite Chayefsky's brilliant script, in parts of the film, after a while the script seemed to me increasingly verbose and almost irritating in its deluge of words. In addition, although he wrote some brilliant speeches for his characters, I think he wrote too many of them, probably because (another criticism) he tried to make too many political points in one 2-hour film. For example, Arab petrodollars in the 1970s generated the same overwrought fears as Japanese capital in the 1980s and Chinese capital today. Finally, many reviewers on this site have called this film prescient. Well, I suppose the existence of reality TV and a Kardashian-oriented channel might suggest Network's prescience, but actually we're in an era of narrowcasting and not broadcasting as many of us have 500 or more cable channels from which to choose, and all of us have access to numerous offerings on YouTube. If you're so inclined, you're able to watch nature documentaries, ballet performances, classic films, European golf tournaments, biographies, and literate sitcoms, and you're not confined to watch what the mass audience liked in Network.",Network
193,rajah524-3,"The Characters =are= Interesting, But the Script is In Your Face",10,29 July 2010,"My review is #240 of 240, so I'm not exactly expecting it to be seen by very much of anyone... and that may be a good thing.Like most of the other reviewers, I get the forecasting of future TV programming, pandering to the lowest common denominator, etc., even though the early days of cable showed us that the entertainment- and information-driven imperative was still alive in the decade that followed. In the end, of course, the marketing- and profit-driven imperatives won out on most cable channels, as well. Save for AMC, TCM and a very few others, pandering continues to be profitable, and if a network is publicly owned. (Okay; so much for the high cost of capitalism.) I'm less interested in that than in calling attention to the specific information Chayefsky chose to impart from the lips of his two principle truth-tellers: Peter Finch's Howard Beale and Ned Beatty's Arthur Jensen. The viewer who listens carefully -- and, okay, from an informed perspective -- will hear some of the most accurate ""realpolitik"" ever in a widely distributed, ""major"" motion picture.Beale's existential angst sounds like his muse was some well-grounded combination of Friedrich Nietzsche and Noam Chomsky on a good day. Jensen's stunning, five-minute disquisition on international corporatism was similarly rooted in accurate and current reality.Folks given to reading authors like Sartre, Camus, Tillich and Heidegger will hear their views spewing from the lips of the newscaster gone (ostensibly) over the dam. Folks given to reading authors like P. D. Scott, Al Gore, Warren Hinckle, William Turner and Alfred McCoy will hear them in the spellbinding chairman of the board.Beyond that, the subplot about the network's parent company being in jeopardy of being taken over by the Saudi's who've been keeping the outfit afloat is the stuff of all manner of offshore turkey buzzards coming to roost in early '91 and just about ever since.Chayefsky knocked out a number of interesting scripts, including those for ""Altered States,"" ""The Hospital"" (with George C. Scott) and ""Marty"" (Ernie Borgnine's career-maker), but this would be almost anyone's tour de force. It's right there in a pigeonhole close to ""Dr. Strangelove,"" ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""The Gangs of New York"" for surreal renditions of discomfiting, social reality.",Network

One can help but think about this movie which debuted in 1977. Network is essentially about the lenghts people will go to secure a rating on TV. Peter Finch plays Howard Beale who upon hearing of his termination, decides to let things loose at air. Problem is that his show becomes the highest rated on T.V and  Faye dunaway will do anything to keep him. The film has a subplot involving Dunaway and Holden as lovers but this is really Peter Finch's movie as he has the most memorable lines (""i am angry and i am not going to take it anymore"") and scenes from the movie(His death scene is especially ironic and funny as the narrator says he is the first person ever killed because his show had low ratings.

The story is simple:  a TV anchorman goes nuts on the air after being fired, so an ambitious programmer decides to give him his own show when the ratings go through the roof.  Simple as it may sound, it doesn't begin to explain how funny and how cynical this movie is.  Finch is great as the prophet Howard Beale, whose legitimately insane (and profane) ramblings draw huge audiences, as is Dunaway, as the highly-driven programmer behind Beale's show.  Holden is also good as the depressing ex-news dept. head, whose friendship with Beale is strained by Beale's new-found insanity.

Today I saw it again, 30 years later and I feel so sad that movies like this are just not made. It's not just the fact that the dialogue is so erudite you could cry. It's not just the fact that the actors are true personages of the screen who are not interchangeable with the myriad of others just like them that make the covers of modern magazines. But it's about ideas! It explores and confronts them and makes us think! It's not just TV that has come down to the level of the moronic, it's also movies. Stack this up against any modern box office success and you will find that our modern movies are so pale by comparison, you want to weep for what we have lost as an artistic people.

Beales outrage is exploitated, and his exploitation opens the door for the exploitation of Radical political groups, who in turn exploit the powers that be for all they can as well. A nice vicious circle of life as made possible by having access to millions of attention spans at once. In pre movie/tv days information and politcal movements moved slowly, and built over time.

THE WORLD IS A BUSINESS, Mr. Beale!""), Robert Duvall (a horribly-tempered, cunning executive at UBS who will discard anyone and anything that stands in his way of a hit show and high ratings), and Beatrice Straight (as Schumaker's betrayed wife, her roughly 6 minutes of on-screen time absolutely brilliant) are perfection. It is without a doubt one of the finest-acted films ever made.But it's not just the acting. The script by Chayefsky is...beyond words. It got EVERYTHING RIGHT. How he saw this in 1976 is beyond me. The sleaziness and filth promoted by the world and the media; how TV will do anything-ANYTHING-for a rating; the consumerism and greed of the world, egged on by every advertiser and seller (it reminded me of a strip from the greatest comic ever, Calvin and Hobbes, where Bill Watterson sarcastically notes in regard to how Christmas has become a materialistic feast for the world at large (as opposed to a tradition of religion cerebrated in Christianity) ""What better way to celebrate a religious holiday than with a month of frenzied consumerism!"") and corporation; the collapse of morality (represented by Schumaker, a good man sucked into a hurricane of brutality, deserting his wife of 25 years for Christensen) and the mocking of those who still guard it; the discarding of family values; everything. Furthermore, aside from the themes, the sheer wit, prose, lyricism, and even emotion of the script (""You are television incarnate Diana...Indifferent to pain, insensitive to joy, all human life is reduced to the common rubble of banality"", Schumaker tells Christensen) are phenomenal. It's beyond masterful, it's PROPHETIC. Unreal.The number of chilling moments in this film is off the charts, from Beale's legendary ""I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!"", to Schumaker's revealing of his affair to his wife (Straight's performance in this scene is incredible), to the dialogue of Jensen in his goosebump-inducing speech (""And YOU have meddled with THE PRIMAL FORCES OF NATURE, MR. BEALE! AND YOU! WILL! ATONE!"" *pauses* ""Am I getting through to you Mr. Beale?""), to Schumaker's final scene with Christensen, to the horrifying climactic scene. Sidney Lumet's excellent direction (this is BY FAR his greatest film) and Owen Reizman's jaw dropping cinematography are the icing on the cake.Network, in short, is an absolute masterpiece, and the most prophetic film ever made. There will never be anything like it again.",Network
218,noneabve1947,Who Is Insane??,10,9 October 2008,"I first saw this with a ""temporary girlfriend"" in a theater in Berkeley, CA in the year it came out. I was stunned then and I'm even moreso over 30 years later now that I have the DVD. It was a strange era to live through, especially if you were just forming your world view. Cocaine was king, we had just lost Vietnam, Patty Herst had been kidnapped and turned into a terrorist, we had been to the moon, and all that was on TV was crap like ""The Bionic Woman"", ""Phyllis"" and ""The Love Boat"". Into this mix comes Howard Beale. His announcement of on-the-air suicide seems nuts until he goes on-air to go out ""with dignity"". This he does...simply saying ""Well, I just ran out of bullshit"". At least he knew what he was talking about. Fay Dunaway comes in as a perfect ghoul. Aided by Robert Duvall as a station head with no morals we get the cult of profit and the ""anything for a buck"" (or a 50 share!) greed we get what the public REALLY wants...audio-video valium with a strong urge to BUY!!! The side note here that most people who see it now rarely understand is the Patty Hearst-Symbionese Liberation Army-Angela Davis thing. Look it up and you'll get it. The greatest and SCARIEST speech comes from Arthur Jensen (Ned Beatty) near the end where he explains the true world system. Looking at the current news I just think ""Oh, Howard...where are you when we need you?""",Network
219,weekly-movie-review,Network reminds me of movies like 12 Angry Men...,9,15 May 2009,"Network reminds me of movies like 12 Angry Men, in which the film draws its strength from a superstar cast, all at the top of their game. The plot takes place at a major television network, where ethics fly out the window in favor of good ratings. The film has a certain post-apocalyptic feeling to it, in the way that the human race just seems to have gone completely off its collective rocker and everyone is in defense mode, caring only about themselves to survive. It's either that, or just good ol' fashioned greed. Faye Dunaway's character is downright ferocious, while William Holden as Max seems to be one of the few left with any integrity whatsoever. Peter Finch plays a great crazy guy and delivers the film's most famous line, ""I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!!"" Although, for some reason the scene in which this line was delivered did not impact me the way I hoped it would, but the overall story was much more interesting than I expected. There's not much to offer in the way of costumes, sets, etc., but if you're looking for a great character movie full of tremendous acting, this is one of the best.",Network

By turns an intense drama and a grotesque comedy, Network is the story of a failing news program exploiting the sudden popularity of an anchor in the middle of a nervous breakdown.  I was really caught off guard by the power and down-right scariness of this film, as it dissects the stomach-turning machinations of a morally depraved industry. Even more pointed now than it was in '76!

Television is a God-damned amusement park!

224,jwalzer5,Chayefsky's Golden Swan Song,10,2 March 2002,"""Network"" is, quite simply, one of the finest American films.  Chayefsky had skewered doctors in ""The Hospital,"" but the molten scorn he poured onto the television industry in ""Network"" is an intense, invective-laden experience not to be missed. Ahead of his time, as usual, he foresaw the corrosive effects of television on its docile audience, and was brave enough to say so. The toxic barbs which Chayefsky embedded in his ""Network"" screenplay, were a refreshing change of pace from the sugary, fairy-tale, cracker-barrel-philosophy garbage, like ""Rocky"", which were so prevalent at the time.  That ""Rocky"" beat ""Network"" in the Oscar best-picture race is no surprise: Hollywood has always preferred illusion to cold reality.""Network"" is a stinging reminder that scintillating dialogue and first-class acting are still the hallmarks of great cinema.  Chayefsky's script is searing in its contempt for the dead weights in the entertainment industry that drag everything down to their own, dead level, a reproach that is more relevant than ever in 2002.  In any case, brilliant performances by Holden, Finch, Dunaway, Beatrice Straight, Robert Duval, and Ned Beatty make this film a joy.",Network
225,Senator_Corleone,Brilliant and biting indictment of modern culture,10,11 January 2003,"Spoiler Alert When I first viewed ""Network"", I thought it was pretty good, but I didn't think that it was the masterpiece everyone said it was. But on my second viewing my opinion changed radically. I finally picked up on the level of the dialogue, the subtleness of much of the humor, and (most importantly) what the movie was really trying to say. ""Network"" is not just a brutal satire of TV, but one of the whole ""entertain me now"" culture that TV has created. It shows us that this new mindset is slowly destroying our intelligence and ability to reason-as William Holden (in one of his best-ever performances) says, ""She's been raised by Bugs Bunny.""The film has many funny moments. Not laugh-out-loud funny, but chuckle-ironically-to-yourself funny. Like when the woman terrorist tells Faye Dunawaye ""Don't f*ck with my distribution rights!"" Or when Robert Duvall responds to the idea of having someone killed by saying ""OK, let's think about this for a second."" One of my personal favorite scenes is where Dunawaye makes love while blathering about her TV-scheduling schemes, pausing only once in her diatribe in order to climax. The complete brilliance of this scene didn't hit me on the first viewing, but it is amazing in the way it reveals just how obsessed Dunawaye's character is with this success through mass entertainment-how much her life revolves around it. Her character is the template for every career-obsessed sitcom female in history.The dialogue is on another level. ""Network"" is one of the greatest screenwriting achievments in film history. Of course, what else would you expect from something written by Paddy Chayefsky? Somewhere in between ""The Maltese Falcon""'s hard-boiled block prose and ""Pulp Fiction""'s flowery pop-culture riffing, ""Network"" seems to have all of its characters saying the exact right thing at the exact right time. Without actors to carry the dialogue, though, it falls flat. Luckily for the film (and for us), ""Network"" has on its roster some of the strongest acting presences at the time of it being made. William Holden gives his last truly great performance as an aging TV producer who sees the dangerous shift around him and (eventually) decides not to go with it. Faye Dunawaye in what might be her greatest role as Diana Christensen, the seemingly confident career woman who is coming apart at the seams. Beatrice Straight won an oscar for her 5 1/2 minute part as Holden's betrayed but forgiving wife. Robert Duvall continued his streak of great films in the 70's as Frank Hackett, the TV station's cold-as-ice hachet (get it?) man. And Peter Finch won an oscar posthumously for his role as Howard Beale, a man who is robbed of the only thing he has left, his job, and fly off the deep end. Then he is cruelly used and exploited by the network he so dilligently served for so many years. His yell of ""I'm mad as hell and I'm not gonna take it anymore!"" is one of the more unforgettable moments in filmdom. The fact that De Niro deserved the oscar more for ""Taxi Driver"" isn't a factor when you are watching ""Network"", one of the most powerful of all films. Few movies give you something new every time you watch them, but this film gave me so much more on my second viewing than on my first that it seemed unreal. One of the beginning scenes shows a dejected Beale, upon finding out he is going to lose his job, telling a national audience he is going to blow his brains out on the air. It takes the control room hotshots a few moments before they even realize what he has said. This lack of concentration, this shortened attention span, this jaded and bored outlook-this is what ""Network"" is about. I realized that, but not until I saw it for a second time.",Network
226,dataconflossmoor-1,Madness And Mayhem Have A Market Share!,10,22 November 2010,"This satirical masterpiece is considered, by experts, to be one of the greatest movies ever made. This website ranks it 197 out of the top 250 movies ever created. AFI (American Film Institure) ranks ""Network"" one of the top 100 American films (#66) to ever be produced. The phrase ""I'm as mad as Hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore"" is ranked the 19th most famous quote ever, in the history of the cinema by AFI. Last, but certainly not least, the script for ""Network"" is rated as the eighth best script ever written, according to discerning critics of the Writer's Guild of America East. This last accolade is one for which I wholeheartedly concur with. Originally, the film ""Network"", was inspired by an incident which involved a possible corporate takeover of the ABC News Division back in 1970. The entire matter of a corporate takeover of a network news division initiated an outburst of creative genius from Paddy Chaefsky (The writer of ""Network"") to address the dubious repercussions of such a corporate megalomaniac's scenario. Should a corporation take over a major network's news division, the ultimate goal of huge profits would compromise the journalistic integrity of the news, as well as the news' tenacious objective for hard bitten accuracy! The film ""Network"" became a cult sensation which fascinated the movie audience. The traumas of terrorism and apocalyptic catastrophe are reduced to numbers on a conceptualization analysis chart which crossed the table of a Madison Avenue boardroom! Their degree of doom and despair is measured in terms of marketability potential! Tummultuous radicalism became relegated to the mundane process of contractual consent decree. Basically, Howard Beale was a deteriorating news anchorman for UBS whose neurotic compulsions escalated into a Nielson ratings bonanza. Within the realm of exaggeration, all occurrences in this movie were acrimoniously plausible! The unprecedented talent in ""Network"" is unbelievable. Sidney Lumet, was a director who was driven by the uncompromising efforts of New York Theatre. Peter Finch, and Faye Dunaway, were performers who had an enormous amount of theatrical experience, this was advantageous to the support of their roles in ""Network"". Other performers in this film, William Holden, and Robert Duvall, were actors who were known for their straight shooter intensity, and, their ability to cogently focus! ""Network"" was a film which depicted a bevy of left wing coups and wanted criminals to be an auspiciously cunning carnival show for caricatured reprobates. Each character in the movie had their own brand of emotions; William Holden (Max Schumaker) was always afflicted with one sordid conundrum after another,this always left him ethically challenged. His wife, (Beatrice Straight- Who won an Academy Award for best supporting actress with her character)played the part of the proverbially injured party.Peter Finch,(Howard Beale) who won the Oscar (posthumously) for best actor with this role, became an overnight pop culture icon who was perpetually agitated. Howard Beale belonged in one of three places, Bellvue, Believe it or Not, or, the third one, which wound up being his choice; Prime Time Television. Robert Duvall (Frank Hackett) was the corporate yes man who thought everything could conform to a Fortune 500 pie chart. Ned Beaty, (Arthur Jensen) was the dictatorial disciple who explained to all parties involved that euphemistic phraseology and showbiz buzz words were simplistic subterfuges which corporations used to accommodate their precarious quest for the almighty dollar. Finally, Faye Dunaway, (Diana Christensen) was the television induced purveyor for ratings popularity.. For her, corporate callousness was a by product of lucrative business decisions. Faye Dunaway's performance as Diana Christensen was perhaps the single greatest performance that I have ever seen in any movie whatsoever. A performance like this, has the potential to spoil the writers of a movie script! Such esoteric dialog that ""Network"" possessed, straddles the fence of liability which can be made or broken on a performer's delivery. Such a stellar delivery of the lines in this movie, by Faye Dunaway, could very well be perceived as a windfall of reassurance to the writers, directors and produces of this film. Suffice it to say, Faye Dunaway won for best actress in 1976 with her role in ""Network"". The single greatest attribute which an actor or actress can garner with a part, is the quality of having a totally comprehensive control of the part in which they are playing.(Prime examples of actors with this quality are Al Pacino and Kevin Spacey) Faye Dunaway's performance in ""Network"" indeed, epitomizes such a remarkable feat! The ability to detach yourself from the mechanical persona which you have assumed in a movie, cultivates a zenith in professionalism, with it, emanates an idealistic state of mind! This performer's dichotomous isolation establishes a necessary bluntness for their character, thus making it easier for that character to be effectively entertaining! Faye Dunaway's portrayal of Diana Christensen was one whereby the utterly heartfelt responses of a human being were very derivative for her, realizing that, she confined herself to her work. The fact that she was impervious to compassion, devoid of vulnerability, and ""insensitive to joy"", was what made Diana Christensen's stilted demeanor vicariously devastating to any decent individual with whom she encountered! Director, Sidney Lumet, was vehement about requiring that the character of Diana Christensen remain academically ruthless all throughout the entire film. His purpose for doing this was to see to it that she would purport an essential mass media concept which made this movie extremely powerful. This omnipotent concept advocated a sub humanoid philosophy that unfortunately establishes rudimentary ground rules for the disconcerting and virulent world of television. This film was spectacular! Why ""Network"" lost out for best picture to ""Rocky"" is very inconceivable to me! Paddy Chaefsky and Sidney Lumet were brilliant! All of the actors and actresses were magnificent!! The fact that it did not win for best picture in 1976, leaves me with only one thing to say: ""I'm as mad as Hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!!""",Network

229,ruthierocks,A latter day prophecy.,9,21 October 2008,"Network is one of those films that sticks with the viewer long after the credits roll. It is immensely entertaining and easily one of the best black comedies I've seen in a long time. Network exaggerates a lot, but is sadly a testament to most television networks in that most of them do anything for better ratings. Find out what the people like and give them what they want. With an impressive and talented cast and a capable director, Network is a solid, well written film with few problems and a lot of satire.From the first few scenes, I thought Network would be one of those preposterous, unbelievable movies that would have me rolling my eyes at the idea of it being considered a classic. I was wrong. The film does very well in its purpose of showing the lunacy that goes on behind the scenes of television. We have a news anchor who goes crazy and, when ratings skyrocket, his well-being is the last thing that anyone is worried about. The characters here all seem to get caught up in making this fictitious television network the hottest thing on the tube. It is exaggerated, yes, but it makes a firm point and does so in a satirical manner that leaves the viewer satiated.Probably the best thing about Network is the wonderful, wonderful dialogue. Every word is sharp and it contains some of the most quotable lines in the history of cinema. Most notably, the famous, ""I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore!"" delivered rather brilliantly by the late Peter Finch (who, deservedly, won a posthumous Oscar for the role). The rest of the cast is equally brilliant, especially the always-delightful Faye Dunaway, who plays a woman obsessed with getting to the top. William Holden, Robert Duvall, and Ned Beatty are all solid in their roles as well.There's never a dull moment here and, although the ending was a bit extreme, the film makes its point in a way that is both amusing and thought-provoking. Even though it's over thirty years old, Network is still relevant to today and, aside from the lack of cellular phones and personal computers, is not in the least bit dated.

With an interesting, different point of view on the world, people don't find him to be credible or even sane.I think Beale is in between a state of insanity and bliss. He is done with society generating sheep who follow TV as their gospel, and people being fuelled by money. He isn't exactly enlightened, but is so finished with society that he has become this charismatic force not to be reckoned with.I think this film is especially relevant today, as we are dealing with issues even more fatal to humanity that are being decided by capitalism, like global warming and a lot of political issues.I think this is just about, pretty much a film. The reason for this is because it has a clear message and something to say about society, but it is in many ways a movie because it is quite formulaic like a traditional Hollywood product film. The cinematography isn't exactly stylish, and doesn't hold any difference to any other Hollywood film. It is also quite boring and not gripping at many points in the film, which suggests it isn't exactly filled with inspiration.I gave this film a 6 out of 10 because of those reasons mostly, and also because a lot of the acting was also stale and boring, with the best actors being Faye Dunaway and Peter Finch.",Network
235,Kyle Westphal,One of the Greatest Masterpieces to Come out of the 1970's,10,16 December 1999,"The Plot: At low-rated network UBS, newsreporter Howard Beale (Peter Finch, in an Oscar-winning role) vows to kill himself on the air. The telecast promises to draw huge numbers. However Howard does not kill himself and rants to the audience that he ""simply ran out of bullsh**"". Faye Dunaway, playing a ratings-seeking programmer decides Beale's ranting and raving could draw a great audience and decides to keep him on the air, much to the anger of William Holden, playing an old producer. Holden's objections don't matter because UBS has been taken over by a greedy corporation represented by Robert DuVall. Howard is put back on the air as the ""mad prophet of the airwaves"" and tells viewers all across America to go out to their window and shout ""I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!"" Soon, Howard gets his own show. But what is UBS to do when the ratings start to drop?My Critique: Perhaps the cinema's greatest satire ever. Dunaway, Holden, and Finch give magnificent performances. DuVall and Ned Beatty are excellence as dark, cold executives. Many films such as ""Easy Rider"", ""The Graduate"", or ""West Side Story"" are called dated. Many say ""Easy Rider"" look ridiculous today. ""Network"" has done something very hard to do. Instead of growing ""dated"", ""Network"" has infact grown even more accurate. Back in the 1970's, ""Network"" could have been considered a drama with a wacky premise. What a difference two decades makes. The idea of an insane man yelling about the problems of the world on television doesn't seem shocking today. FOX already has hours of footage a week described as ""World's Wildest Police Chases"".

237,Raiderofthelastfries,Tremendous,10,20 December 2002,"In a 1970's review, who's author I'm at an unfortunate loss to recall, it was prophecized that Network would be a huge commercial smash. Imagine that! Could a movie like this woo modern crowds who labor under the belief that by simply being enjoyable a movie is worthy? No. There is a pleasant lack of what in modern terms could be considered ""commercial appeal"", in fact there is not even a score to manipulate our emotions as the director sees fit, which alone merits praise. Our latter day Athenian crowds squeal like indignant pigs when their vices are questioned (""If you don't like it, leave America""), but regardless it should be done in the spirit of satire, at least. How wonderful then that Paddy Chayefsky does an extraordinary job. Yes, maybe the message will fall on deaf ears, as another review has stated. Perhaps we have embraced Jerry Springer as ""a crazy uncle"", and badly staged sex scenes on tv still makes us grunt like pigs in estrus; as long as there are people of reason, the truth of Chayefsky's indictment will not fade away. I believe that credit for the success of the picture can be divided equally among the Writer, the cast, and the director( yes, Hollywood folk out there who read this. The credit should not be the director, the cast, and then-lastly-the Writer), who perform their duties with the skill much lacking in the younger filmmakers of today. *sigh* Now if only ageism could be abolished in Hollywood, the teen demographic utterly forgotten, and innovative ideas given their day instead of being rewritten to be safe, yawn inducing cliches by illiterate ""writers"" with an eye toward a new Lexus.... Enjoy this crown jewel of cinema that could only have been made in the 70's, a great decade for movies. It did not earn Best Picture, of course(Rocky did) which I'd call it a crime, but given that the Academy of Motion Pictures has also awarded How Green Was My Valley Best Picture in the same year as the release of Citizen Kane, never gave Hitchcock an award, nor Stanley Kubrick, and among other laughable deeds gave Julia Roberts an oscar over Ellen Burstyn, the academy has rendered itself obsolete in mine eye.",Network

As a person trying to work up the media food chain, I truly learned how Robert Duvall's character thinks and without a hitch, Duvall acts it to perfection. A man who is only trying to appease his boss while trying to make money for himself as well. Of course as the old saying goes, the crap goes downhill and the film shows this to perfection with the help of excellent acting. Faye Dunaway as the TV exec who just wants a 30 share is deserving of her Oscar as she shows her agressiveness to achieve her dream in more than just the office. For William Holden, he does a great job as the person who tries to fight for what is best for not only his best friend but for news. Then we have Peter Finch, his excellent performance as ""The Madman Prophet Denouncing the Hypocracies of our Times."" As he slowly deteriorates, he performs a perfect role as he simply speaks his mind about ""social truth."" Now what makes his character the closest thing to a modern tragedy is the truth about his character. A mental mess who in turn becomes a major piece of the corporate ladder.Looking at it with eyes that I seen now, this film is more then just satire. It was a social study that's spot on with the for-telling of the future. With the conglomerate's that own TV now and the messages that are expressed, whether it's for Fox or CNN. The message will be clear once you see Network and the if you are any bit socially aware, this film will scare you and for that this film deserves its place in history.",Network
239,rehensle,TV Bad,4,9 May 2021,"This feels like one of those ""I'm 14 and this is deep"" movies. The messages this movie tells feel mishmashed together and as a result seem disjointed. The film mentions current events such as Watergate and Vietnam war are making people more politically woke. And then the main character, Howard Beale, starts to rant about that stuff on his TV platform, saying ""I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!"", so then everyone watching starts yelling it too. So this movie is supposed to be some commentary on how everyone is sheeple and will be persuaded by what their TV says.Now I'm not doubting that mass media can have a significant effect on the way people behave. But the way people react to the media in this film feels so unnatural that it's hard to take any of the messages seriously. So at the end of the day, it just feels like an early example of one of those memes you'd see on Facebook; the ones that say ""TV screens bad"", ""Computers bad"", ""Books good"". It's boomer humor! Even the main antagonist who's responsible for shaping the Howard Beale Show is depicted a soulless person who's worldview is framed by what she's seen on TV. A supporting character literally says this as if he has the moral high ground, despite cheating on his wife (another staple of boomer humor).Overall it just seems to be a movie that condescends the current generation because they watch TV sometimes. TV Bad and TV creates bad morals. They also try to throw in stuff about all networks being controlled by corporations; shocking isn't it? Network seems like it has a lot to say, but it's all really surface level.",Network

241,rafael_jaramillo_avellan,"Brilliant, well paced, original, brutal, and last but not least, CLASSIC.",9,19 September 2016,"We are all mad as hell, and we won't take it any longer. After 40 years, Network (NW) remains a true classic, not only as one of the 70's best movies but of all time.The original screenplay written by Paddy Chayefsky is one of the bests to date. The story is so smart and intriguing, it is impossible to get bored in any second of the film. The strong dialogue helps to connect with every character, especially Ned Beatty and Beatrice Straight's monologues, which are astonishing for being so short. Both introduction and closure of the story introduce you effectively into the commentary made on television and media power over society.Behind the television and corporate cloak, there's also the complex human relationships surrounding Max. From his friendship with Howard, his affair with Diana, and the confrontation with his wife, the human touch is strong with this one, making it easier to feel related with this protagonist. Sidney Lumet does an excellent job, challenging his cast to exploit their dramatic skills. Also, very precise with the camera. I applaud Ned Beatty's scene, where the angle and camera position of the speech emphasizes the powerful message of Mr. Jensen to Howard.Time to talk about the performances. All of them, convincing and lasting impersonations of deeply written and complex characters. These are brought to life with such talent you can't lose sight of any when they are on screen. William Holden makes an honest hero with the most ethical intentions; Peter Finch is precise and over the top being the ""mad prophet"" who loses his mind; Faye Dunaway transforms into the calculating and fragile main antagonist. The short appearances of Max's wife and Mr. Jensen are ephemeral and potent, making them worth of their nominations and prices.FINAL CONSENSUS: Black comedy, drama, human relations, controversy, terrorism, manipulation, media commentary, romance, Network mixes in pitch perfect these elements to make one of the best movies ever made.",Network
242,requiem1896,A Cynic's Dream,9,3 January 2005,"This is one of those wonderful films where everything comes together. The acting and the writing is by far the most impressive elements of this film. William Holden and Peter Finch should have both received Oscars for their performances, instead of just Peter Finch. Faye Dunaway pulls of the most dynamic and emotional characters she has ever played.The true brilliance of this film is that all elements of it fade appropriately behind the actors and their messages. The film is completely a work of storytelling and, at least for the writer, stunning clarity of message and purpose. Political films come and go but few remain in the annals of film because of their effectiveness at their own message. The cinematography, editing, sound, costume design, art direction and production design are all quite simplistic. In some scenes the film can be accused of being almost ugly. However this all lends to the back-washing of the film so as to allow the message to ring loudest. In my opinion, Sidney Lumet took this just a little too far and thus I give it a 9 instead of a 10.This is certainly a film for the history books. Every connoisseur of film should be exposed to this movie at some point in their life. If you happen to be cynical, then you will love every minute of this movie as its stark view of life in the 1970's (and onward) touches the hard of even the hardest of cynics. For those educators out there, GREAT film for classes on Media and Politics.",Network

It was extreme and something that no one ever thought would ever happen. Simply put it was an extremely funny dark comedy.  Since the movie was realeased the ""news"" long ago became more tabloid than news.  We may not have a Howard Beale type prophet doing the news, but we are not far off. Now with all the ""reality TV shows"" Network is becoming more self-fulfilling prophecy every day.

244,ClassicMovieFans,A gripping classic not to be missed,10,5 August 2005,"Network is a successful movie who brings out the best of the excellent cast - Peter Finch, Faye Dunaway, William Holden, by providing them with the best lines on screen EVER.Peter Finch played Howard Beale, a TV news anchorman, who was forced to retire because of poor TV ratings. By announcing he would kill himself exactly one week later right in front of the TV, he became a household celebrity and his fame was fully exploited by Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway). She gave Howard Beale to host an out-of-the box news show which became an instant hit.Howard Beale, as the guru of life philosophy, talked wisdom on the show. He touched the hearts of the people and the scene he told everyone to open the windows and shouted, "" ...., I'm not going to take it anymore!"" was unforgettable. It was a dark rainy night, and neighbors simply shouted their exasperation across the streets. Under the excellent script and unusual lines, the characters were brought to life. Peter Finch was exactly the mad man he was supposed to be. He was disillusioned off the show. Once in the spotlight, he was transformed into the wise man who inspired. Faye Dunaway was the beautiful talented workaholic who, as she described herself, failed in marriage but excelled at work. William Holden was the righteous man Max Schumacker in work, as far as how he wanted to save Howard Beale from being madder, but experienced his mid-life crisis in personal life. The lines for Mrs. Schumacker secured Beatrice Straight her Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.But I had underestimated the pivotal role Arther Jensen (Ned Beatty). I was just telling myself he did not look like the top man of a conglomerate which toke over the UBS TV network. Yet at his meeting with Howard Beale in the grand conference room with dimed lights, his powerful voice hypnotized Howard Beale and made a lasting effect on Beale, the new TV show and the fate of both. Who is the great master of influence afterall?This is a great movie who pulls off an unparalleled success in all aspects. The director and the script managed to tell in just more than 2 hours the people, the syndicated TV era and ratings, politics between the takeover man and the TV network. A modern movie never to be missed.",Network
245,corazontvc,"Only surprise is, it wasn't cynical enough",9,23 November 2017,"I recently rewatched this movie I've seen at least a dozen times and capture something new every time. It's a complete no holds barred hollowing out of the television industry, and, while television isn't the all looming force it once was (500 channels as opposed to around 7 including PBS and VHF and UHF at the time of this movie, depending on location), it still has much to say about the dissociation from reality that viewing things on a screen can create, especially when what you're witnessing is designed for the most craven response.Plot is quite simple: long time news anchor (Howard Beale) has breakdown after being fired and loses it on air, bigwigs (Diana Christensen) notice said breakdown brought in more ratings than ever before and nurture this tendency until a monster is created that is against their best interests ($$) and now must destroy this monster. All in the way this is portrayed is what makes it so much more.This is a deeply cynical movie, and quite prescient. A few years after this movie, the TV world was going to experience crudity on levels it had never imagined before. Morton Downey Jr. to Geraldo would usher in an age of the normalization of TV as spectacle, prurience and depravity we are very much still engaged in today. The kernel of the idea of capturing eyeballs with such content has simply been even more economically fine-tuned by other mediums, especially the Internet. Want to see beheadings, torture porn or video of people being shot to death? Sure you do. Diana predicted it. The natural progression of major character Diana's ideas are present for all to see. Only, it may not have been cynical enough in some ways. Could they have predicted reality TV? Or the endless line of meaninglessly competitive shows like Cupcake Wars? Jackass? At the beginning, it even toys with the idea of 'The Death Hour', filled with suicides and assassinations and car wrecks. We haven't seen anyone purposely killed on live TV to get ratings by a network, to my knowledge, but I doubt that is far away based on current trajectory.Not to mention the brilliant critique of business by Arthur Jensen's (Ned Beatty) epic speech to Howard Beale. We are all just a subsidiary to business interests, AS IT SHOULD BE. The richest 1% own half the world's wealth. This was not an accident or survival of the fittest in a meritocracy, this was planned from the inception.While the dialogue is brilliant, this dialogue is meant to convey ideas, not especially to capture how people really talk in various situations. It is more theatric than realistic. That brings us to probably the weakest part of the movie, the romantic aspect. It plays a parallel plot to the main one, and while it does serve to show that Diana is a 'Humanoid' in Beale's terms-seemingly human, but not really-it's also the weakest element. Hence, the lack of one star.A point must be made about Faye Dunaway. This is her greatest movie. Bonnie and Clyde may have opened the door, but this broke it down. She encapsulates the inherent cynicism and calculating nature of Diana Chirstensen (play on offspring of Christ?) with near perfection. Her sheer physical presence is something to behold as well. From her impossibly high cheekbones to her lithe figure wrapped in chic 70's elegance, she steals every scene she's in. Just do yourself a favor and don't look up her more recent pics, plastic surgery is not her friend.Will young people like this movie? Not if they want a fist bumping silly night, but if they sense they are being manipulated and want to know why, this is one place that was at ground zero.",Network

247,Sickfrog,Life Imitates Art,10,14 August 1998,"Here we have Sidney Lumet at his best. ""Network"" follows a struggling television network as it goes to drastic and immoral measures to get ratings. And as unreasonable and unrealistic as it seemed at the time... nowadays, it is frighteningly reminiscent of modern television. William Holden gives an incredible performance as a producer who sees to what ludicrous extents the network has gone, but is unable to stop it. Frankly, mainstream society's willingness to swallow the sensationalism the network feeds them is more powerful than anything he can do. And therefore, he must sit back and watch it happen. Peter Finch gives an excitable performance as well as an anchorman who has been driven to a mental breakdown, and then becomes the voice of the masses. Faye Dunaway, usually a terribly stagey and unrealistic actress, actually tags her role for once, for which I give credit most to the screenwriter for fleshing out such a solid female character (not always so available). Robert Duvall is strong in his role as a power-hungry executive. And Ned Beatty, proving that he is capable of magnificent acting, received an Oscar nomination simply upon one perfectly scripted and perfectly delivered monologue. In fact, when you break the script down, you find that for the most part, this film is just a series of precise, fine-tuned monologues. And there is nothing wrong with that. No other movie since has come close to hitting upon the subject of media frenzy, America's obsession of television and mass-market sensationalism quite so well as this film did.",Network
248,hanniballe11752,Gloriously dark satire indistinguishable from reality (tv),10,3 June 2001,"Paddy Chayefsky's brilliant satire offers a no-holds barred look behind the scenes at the unscrupulous goings on at a low rated teevee network that will plumb any low for ratings-even murder.Peter Finch stars as Anchor/mad-man Howard Beale, whose on-air rants,""decrying the hypocrisies of our times"", cause a sensation.His marvelously scripted (and delivered) speeches are sardonically funny, yet depressingly true:""Bullsh*t is all the reasons we give for living,"" he tells us,"" and if we can't think up any of our own, we always have the God bullshit. We don't know why we go through all this pain, humiliation, and decay so there better be someone somewhere who DOES know! THAT'S THE GOD BULLSH*T!"" And of course everyone knows his most famous one that's featured in every movie montage ever shown, as another reviewer has stated. That allowing the rants to air uncensored goes against the FCC, and Standards and Practices is not important to the network; millions of people are tuning in, fascinated by this ""Mad Prophet of the Airwaves"" as he's later dubbed, and that means big business.The late, great William Holden (Sunset Blvd) stars as Max Schumacher(unfortunate that his character shares his name with the man who ruined the Batman franchise given that his is the only really likable character in the movie, but what are you gonna do?), Howard Beale's long time friend, and boss. Little by little, his influence is diminished when a conglomorate named CCA takes over the news division, and slowly the evening news is converted into a literal showcase for gossips, and soothsayers. ""Television is show biz, Max, and even the news has a little showmanship"" says exec Diana Christensen(played wonderfully by the gorgeous Faye Dunaway)an irresistably cynical career climber who lusts after ratings with an unnatural, cold blooded zeal. The only joy in her life she tells Max(with whom she begins an adulterous affair) is her work. ""I'm inept at everything else"".See this movie.

249,haydendeepsy,Disaster or opportunity?,10,15 March 2021,"What happens when one is in a rut and just comes upon something new? Does he block it before it can cause a disruption, or does he experiment on it? As the film opens, it has a very clear scenario: a bottom rated network news station; an old anchorman on the verge of retirement; the leader board tending towards change in structure in order to preserve the financial status. And finally, a newly employed programming manager, whose vision is to redirect the station's ideals for programming, in order to better accomodate the public's taste. All blossoms from an unlikely decision to commit suicide, into a table turned network station, now freed of all the morals withholding it from it's approach and adaptation to modern times.
And right about now, from an astute depiction on the utilisation of an original idea, it evolves into so much more. At this point, the solemn duty to report the news is overlooked by the schemes of marketing, whose raging lust for wealth and power, blinds it from any sense of decency. However, when confronted by the very golden goose that has been the ticket to the highest spot, need for help turns to need for leave of abscence.
Network doesn't just tackle the theme of hypochrisy, it brings about themes such as: the sequence of generations, need to hear what one want's to hear, Love vs Lust, Reality vs Illusion, the disappearance of the individual, self destruction, sources of information, the truth, the very state of the world and so much more.
Accompanied by flawless performances who perfectly capture the character's madness, weakness and rationale, not to mention Lumet's hand behind the camera, give the film that which can be descriebed as genius, complimented with profetic undertones.
Network is indeed a masterpiece, whose poetic and ruthless message is what's missing from the world today.",Network

Its cinematic equivalent is Network, one of the highlights in the distinguished career of Sidney Lumet - but in this case, the target is more the relentless pursuit of ratings by the networks.While the focus is originally a news programme, it could have been almost anything. The original purpose of the show simply vanishes, an inconvenient detail discarded by the station, safe in the knowledge that the FCC is a toothless tiger. What brings about the change is the mental and nervous breakdown that befalls news anchorman Howard Beale - a role played to perfection by Peter Finch, for which he deservedly won a Best Actor Oscar.The sick man is shamelessly manipulated by Faye Dunaway and Robert Duvall, against the wishes of William Holden, seemingly Finch's only real friend. All these give virtuoso performances - Dunaway in particular stands out for portraying a woman apparently devoid of human feelings at the office, but capable of love outside it.For all the excellent acting - not forgetting Ned Beatty's towering monologue, for which he also received an Academy nomination - this film isn't perfect. My principal complaint is that it feels excessively long, and at times too sprawling and unfocussed for its own good. The ending also somehow doesn't ring true; while the TV execs have been portrayed as money-grubbing scum, capable of almost any excess (including giving air time to terrorists) in search of another point on the ratings, the notion that they are capable of ordering the cold-blooded murder of someone seems too far-fetched.Those points aside, this is an excellent film.

253,sirkevinho1,The best movie I have ever seen!!!,10,20 November 2005,"I watched this movie about 30 years after it was made and amazingly, it still felt relevant today and seemed like it was made for today's audience. Now that is a movie for the ages!!! I believe this movie was a landmark film back when it was first released in 1976. It dealt with many problems relevant and visible with the TV industry back then, practically the news. It talked about how the industry only cared about ratings, how uncompassionate and realistic it was (taking away people's job when they lose popularity even if they have worked many years) and how greedy it was (creating news by funding different groups that could tear the fabric of society). These issues still remain prevalent in the industry even to this day, in some form or another. Ratings still count, even more people lose their popularity over night (all those ""real"" TV stars comes to mind) and although better nowadays, there are a lot stories that prove to be made up and a publicity stunt just for ratings.Another thing about this movie was its witty observation of today's generation and of the society and rallying the people for change. Who can deny that the younger generations today learn their life from Bugs Bunny? Who does not feel that war, with so many images of war on TV nowadays, is as interesting as a 6-packs of beer? Who can say that they do not try to imitate scenes or lines from movies and TV that they saw? These observations are a wakeup call to society, telling society to change its value, with the rallying cry, ""I am mad as hell, and I won't take it anymore!"" Do not be the TV generation. Have some feelings! Have some compassion! The most incredible thing was how this movie is prophetic in a way. It predicted the next moment in ""trash"" TV, fulfilled by the introduction of ""reality"" TV in recent years. Although the example of Howard Beale was too extreme back in those days, his fall, rise and then the extreme fatal fall narrated in the film did not seem far off today. The wave of reality TV today felt like it was fulfilling the prediction that the movie posed forward. Look at the comparison and you would see that there are uncanny similarities. Reality TV feeds into the egos of the contestants and many of them, with the sudden fame, begins to act like maniacs, like Howard Beale; and just like Howard Beale, the more insane they act, the more the audiences love and encourage. When they lose the appeal, the network see no more use of them and dispose of them, ""killing"" them off, just as the same fate as Howard Beale. The death of them on TV is really the death of them in real life, as most could not accept the loss of fame and the audiences in real life could not accept them as part of their society. The TV personnel and the real personnel are in such contrast that ordinary people just could not handle and label these reality stars as outcasts. The movie is really saying that reality TV shows would kill many innocent people. Remember Najai ""Nitro"" Turpin of the ""Contender""? Or Sinisa Savija of the Swedish version of ""Survivor""? These 2 committed suicide just months after their cast off.The movie could not be the revelation that it is without the great acting by the main characters. Peter Finch stole the show with his portray of down-on-his-luck news anchor Howard Beale. His ramblings were classic, and his observations still hold true. William Holden was solid and though not spectacular, he provides the only sane voice in the movie. Faye Dunaway gave what I consider the best performance of her career, in the role of the power hungry TV producer. Beatrice Straight and Ned Beatty, though having short screen time, each gave a rather memorable monologue and stole the screen with their short time there.Last thing I am going to say about this movie is that even the lives of these actors fulfilled the prophecy of tragic ends put forth by the movie. Peter Finch died of a heart attack while championing for his Best Actor Oscar selection. William Holden died within 5 years after the film was produced. Faye Dunaway had never been in a movie as good as this and her career died off in the 80s. Who remembers Beatric Straight and Ned Beatty after this film (except for film buffs)? In a strange way, these people ""died"" off following their success. Maybe the movie was not as extreme or controversial as it seemed back in those days.",Network
254,frannywentzel,Network does not work,1,29 October 2008,"If you were only to see the scene where news anchor Howard Beale does his 'mad as hell' speech, you'd think this was a gripping well-made indictment of the television industry...It isn't.It's more a disorganized grabastic load of pig crap that looks more like some cloistered monk's supposition of what television is than the real thing - and I'd been looking forward to finally seeing this.You get a few good scenes - Beale's announcement that he's planning to off himself on air works.The contract negotiations with the Ecumenical Liberation Army is hit or miss - spoiled by the stupid name that shrieks 'writer's clever idea'.The revamped news broadcast they build around him face-plants hard. Stingie-ouchie hard.Admittedly this was before the golden era of info-mercials, Video News Releases and the endless line of entertainment quasi-news & gossip shows - you'll note that they all stick fairly closely to the man-behind-a-desk format that Network thinks is in its dying days - but even in the 1970s no television director in their right mind would think that a dark stage with three floodlit spots showing Beal, some Psychic and whatever the other act was is going to fly with audiences on a nightly basis - especially a live studio audience.It just looks bad.

There is a point in the movie where the entire story comes predictable and the main plot gets lost in the way-too-much satiric situations. The best thing about the movie is Faye Dunaway, she is a great actress and it's a pleasure watching her the entire movie. In my opinion a good movie has to be universal, that anybody from any culture/historic time can understand it, to me, this movie just tried to impact its own specific historic moment.

258,MrKearns-2,One of the most superbly made comedy/dramas of all time.,10,2 November 1999,"Network is a drama, and yet, it's probably one of the most darkly hilarious films ever made. Written by Paddy Chayefsky and directed by Sidney Lumet, this film could have starred Steve Guttenberg and still been interesting. But with an all-star cast including William Holden, Faye Dunaway, and Robert Duvall, as well as Peter Finch and Beatrice Straight who received Oscars for their performances, the film takes on an incredible value.The story probably seemed ludicrous in the 1970s, but in the 1990s, well, it still does. Or rather, we want it to. But ignoring our sentiments about television, it's pretty believable. While UBS had the Mao Tse-Tsung hour, Fox is airing When Animals Attack and The World' Scariest Car Chases. They're certainly not too far from Max Schumacher's (William Holden) sarcastic creation ""The Death Hour"".This makes Network strike remarkably close to home and quite effective. But the real skill of this film comes from two performances: Peter Finch as Howard Beale and screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky's tour de force.Finch gives a performance that's absolutely believable, and frankly, it's eerie that he managed to. Beale represents a man so brainwashed by his medium that he actually buys into the fact that life begins and ends on television. Of course, this makes the end all the more funny.The script, although laden with vulgarity, still maintains an honest quality. Scenes such as Beale's meeting with Ned Beatty and most of Beale's monologues are so real that they scare the viewer, yet make him or her chuckle out of mere terror.If nothing else, watch the beginning and the end, because as Lumet's tradition dictates (watch Dog Day Afternoon if you enjoyed Network), the beginning is witty, and the end, well, it'll shock you, but still leave you with a disturbingly black comedic ending.I'd give Network 10 out of 10, although I'd recommend that you see it more than once before passing any major judgments on it.",Network

Well directed and intensely filmed without ever trying to be too clever.Without doubt this film would have provided the inspiration to so many film and t.v. makers to break out of the mold and produce something that really reflects their vision. The acting is as good as the script and rightly earned awards at every level. Despite the fact it is set in the 70's its themes just couldn't be more relevant today.It really is a must see film that makes you realise the huge importance of indie channels such as HBO that in the last twenty years have succeeded in breaking up the networks.,Network
260,wyldeone2,Underbelly Exposed,9,1 September 2017,"What an excellent movie. Way ahead of its time since 1976 was pre cable and pre VCR. Too many scenes to talk about but my favorite was the Ned Beatty (Arthur Jensen) scene where he ""explainified"" the reality of real world billionaires to Peter Finch (Howard Beale).I was surfing for movies with ratings 7.0 or better and found this on one of the IMDb top 250 lists. I had never seen it until August 31 2017 and got to watch it without commercial interruption or paying for over priced cable.TV news has gotten far worse since 1976, with 24 x 7 opinion programs and wishful hate speech of the many so called broadcasters and twits.From a trivial point of view, Ned Beatty (senator Charles F. Meachum) gives a similar reality speech to Mark Wahlberg (Bob Lee Swagger) in the 2007 film Shooter.Thank goodness for public libraries that have such quality titles on DVD and allow them to be checked out for free.

261,Imaginist,Network (3/5 stars),7,22 December 2005,"NETWORK 1976 DIRECTED BY SIDNEY LUMET STARRING WILLIAM HOLDING, FAYE DUNAWAY, AND PETER FINCHSynopsis: ""Network"" sets out to do to television what ""Sunset Boulevard"" did to Hollywood--it attempts to see through the illusion. Notice how I use the word ""attempts""; whereas ""Sunset Boulevard"" blows the audience away, ""Network"" simply runs out of breath. This film is a sad yet satirical tale of the television industry, and more importantly the psychotic rantings of Howard Beale (Finch). Howard is a successful news anchor who at the end of his career approaches insanity; however, his mad monologues (""I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!"") become a hit with audiences. The network at first wishes to pull him off the air as he is rather obscene, but not if Director of Programming, Diana Christensen has anything to do with it! The icy yet alluring director played by Dunaway knows that this raving lunatic will be TV's next big thing, and therefore, that's right you guessed it, exploits him! Countless characters are dragged into the mix, especially Max, who is Beale's old friend and boss. Max is actually quite a wretched character if you ask me: he cheats on his wife with Diana, complains about Beale's exploitation but refuses to act, and ultimately pretends to be some kind of martyr of television. At first I didn't see any reason to have him in the film except to keep us in fresh supply of preachy monologues, but towards the end I began to see his importance. Max compares Diana to being the embodiment of television, which he himself has been lured into. Hence Max becomes a vehicle of symbolism: he is the fool sucked in and spit out by the ""boob"" tube. Max is attracted to Diana's beauty but soon comes to realize that she is nothing but a shell; her heart might as well be a Nielsen ratings guide (There's a great scene of the two of them having sex yet all the while she rambles about next season's programming). William Holding does a good job with Max, and I commend him for that; however that doesn't change the fact that Max not only bores me with his consistent babblings but also disgusts me with his poor moral figure. Max goes back to his wife in the end although we never do see them reconcile (and hopefully they don't--Max should be kicked to the curb). Meanwhile Beale has an encounter with the head of the board of directors, and we get to hear the crazy-ass executive gives us a five minute schpeel about world politics and business. That kind of talk could drive anyone crazy, so you can imagine what it does to Beale. Alas, we are at the end of the film, which is the most ridiculous part: somebody is killed on national television. The reasons for the murder make some sense, but those who organize the execution are so devoid of emotion and empathy that it is beyond over the top. I suppose that is the problem with a lot of this film: it is too much. The consistent monologues make it preachy and the social commentaries and multiple story lines make it convoluted. The largest problem with ""Network"" is that it bounces all over the place. Some parts are really good and other parts are just plain annoying (especially the back-to-back speeches). This film has good intents but can't quite execute them properly. It is trying to show us television for what it really is: an illusion. We are constantly being sucked in by its beautiful lure just as Max was seduced by Diana, and also like Max, we will soon realize that the glitz and glam is only a coating to television's cold and empty core. ""Network"" is supposed to be a warning against television, but it becomes so busy tackling every other social issue that it looses sight of its original intent. When I watch a film I want it to remain consistent without it consistently preaching to me--""Network"" does the opposite. I enjoyed the film, but in the end I thought it was a jumbled mess instead of the biting commentary it could have been. I give ""Network"": 3 out of 5 stars.NOTE: 1/5 stars = bad 2/5 stars = OK 3/5 stars = good 4/5 stars = great 5/5 stars = classic",Network

265,MuckyMuckMan73,A superb satirical exposé on the Manipulative world of TV,9,11 December 2019,"Sidney Lumet's glorious satire about the lengths TV networks will go to obtain those elusive viewing figures is a timeless drama that is as relevant now than it was when it was made considering the political turmoil we are currently experiencing.
Peter Finch plays newscaster Howard Beale who is on the verge of a nervous breakdown after being told he will be sacked after 11yrs of working for the Network. While live on one of his final shows he dramatically tells his audience he will commit suicide on his last show. The executive board are furious and pull him screaming from his chair but viewing figures jump. Executive Diana Christensen (Faye Runaway) pursuades the board to reinstate him and viewing figures soar as his improvised angry rants resonate with the audience.
Scrutinising the lengths the scrupulous & manipulative TV company's will go for higher viewing figures Paddy Chayefsky's incredible script sizzles off his pages and on to the screen as a tour de force cast deliver his lines.
Peter Finch is superb as the crazed iconoclastic & morbid Beale, who tragically died shortly after filming but went on to win a post-humous best actor Oscar. But this isn't just a one man show, everyone involved is quite simply breath taking. Lumet always seems to get the best out of his actors and it's no different here. Brilliant performances from William Holden, Faye Dunaway, Robert Duvall and extraordinary cameos from Beatrice Straight & Ned Beatty (with two of the best scenes in the movie) make Network an outstanding piece of satirical work showing the manipulative power TV holds over the viewing public. It has to be right if the people on the TV are telling us this, right?

Surely a viewer at the time of its original release in the mid-70s could watch this film and know that is was an exaggeration, but it certainly didn't seem like a very far stretch to believe something like this COULD happen.  A quarter century later, in this post September 11 world, we can look back with a little perspective.  What happened that day which changed the world forever, was also the highest rated television show ever.  The evil ones knew that and planned their attack accordingly.

270,zester3,Didn't like it.,3,15 July 2018,"Personally I found it loud, superficial, silly, and ultimately irritating. The frenetic energy had a lot to do, apparently, not with enthusiasm, but the director hurrying it along to keep within budget. What was it all about? An exaggerated demonstration of how people are exploited by the media? They are, but not as blatantly as this. It was supposed to be overdone, of course, but for me that didn't save it. You can call it satire, or what you will, but it became a fantasy, not a drama. The trouble is that, if you want to make a film about exploitation, make it real. To spend two hours being hideously over the top at the top of your voice to make a simple point like that is unnecessary. It wasn't comedic either. It wasn't funny, it was just loud.Of course the acting was fine but the script dwelt too much on money, ratings, materialistic nonsense that personally was about as interesting as watching an accountant doing balance sheets, and myopically so. So, sorry, bored to death and wishing it was over. Which, thankfully, it was eventually. Peace at last.",Network
271,liamsroberts,Network,6,24 May 2019,"I was disappointed by this film. I found the characters to be very one note and I did not care for any of them, except for some exceptions. William Holden's character Max and Peter Finch's character Beale. Beale is by far the most interesting character, an anchorman that is having a mental breakdown. And yes I do believe he is crazy, he is unstable and is being used by people very easily. His insanity is being exploited by the media just to be at the top of the charts. If he were to be enlightened, I would think he would be more stable and have more power over himself. But this film is very relevant to today. With the news being very corrupted, like Fox News, and just saying what their overseers want them to say. This is a film because it has a much greater meaning to it underneath the surface, where movies are action extravaganzas like superhero movies. One of the most memorable scenes in the film is a monologue that is said to Beale, being said by Jenson. I believe that Jenson is telling the truth but in a different and twisted way to convince Beale. It makes you feel more for the character of Beale, it shows he is very weak and is like an animal in a cage, then when they release him from the cage, the news gets all the profit for it.",Network

273,logansomerville,Network: Film,7,24 May 2019,"Is Beale crazy or just enlightened?
Howard Beale in this film in my opinion is more so crazy than enlightened. He is speaking the truth that the people are looking to hear as it is his thoughts without filter. He is seen as enlightened as he is able to do what others are not willing to do because of their reputations and worry of what the public would think. Beale only is able to do this as he has become crazy off of the struggles he has faced losing his wife. Jensen is able to convince Beale with his monologue because Beale is mad enough to hear what Jensen is saying and realize the truth from it. Jensen is successful in convincing Beale about his view of the world being run by money and business not by nations and with people but by business and money. Jenson is correct as money does equal power but the the nations that people gather under give them strength through nationalism and to say money is the only force pushing the world would be incorrect. Jensen is able to convince Beale with his great persuasive speech as well as letting Beale view him similar to the God he has seen in dreams.
This film is still relevant today as many of the ideas shown are in play today. One of the relevant themes shown is how people take all their information from one source and end up disconnecting themselves from reality which in this case is due to television. Today it can be argued that what people revolve themselves is phones and the internet. Our phones and the internet we are connected to by them is our ""Tube"" today.",Network
274,kirkintha26,A rare honest movie,10,4 September 2007,"""Network"" is a fantastic movie that illustrates just how the ""mob"" and the media can exploit even the best intentions for mutual profit.Howard Beale (Peter Finch) is an on-air personality that, after finding he is not bankable anymore, snaps and starts to speak his own uncensored, and highly inflammable commentary about the hypocrisy of modern life.In his mad-hatter routine, somehow he sparks his audience's interest, and in a twist of fame finds himself, the not bankable as prime market share for prime time television. And naturally, his bosses and those who stand to profit from his actions, use his fame to better their own cause.Beale's rise to stardom is only one facet of this intricate story about how the mob influences media. Throughout ""Network"" we as the audience are constantly shown, to nausea, how ruthless popularity and trend mold what we see as consumers of entertainment. Most of the main characters are in fact trapped in their roles - and powerless to the bottom line, which is that media relies on advertisement and ratings to generate revenue.In fact, I believe that is what the point of ""Network"" is - this movie shows us, that ""news"" is entertainment, and how we as viewers (whichever demographic you are) are willing to suspend all common sense, class, independence, honor, integrity for a few moments of triumph or more pragmatically, how we relish tragedy.""Network"" is too heavy for most people - it is meant for people who do not like TV, who think that product placement is ridiculous, and in general do not like to think of themselves as a ""market"".

276,aaronlromano,A Fierce and Searing Media Satire,8,2 August 2012,"Perhaps one of the most brilliant works of satire to appear since Voltaire's Candide, this film points a damning finger at the treachery of the television industry. Faye Dunaway stars in her fabulous Oscar- winning performance as Diana, a calculating TV exec who's only concern is ratings, ratings, ratings who, without any consideration, exploits a hapless news anchor suffering from a mental breakdown. The film features a variety of other stunning performances, two of which rightfully received Oscars, as a variety of excellently painted characters. While also managing to be blackly funny, this film also shows the vastly negative effects of television on the human condition, most accurately defined in one the film's many classic lines: ""Television is not the truth! Television is a Goddamned amusement park!"" But the true brilliance of the film is the fact that in spite of the film being sternly rooted in the 70s era, it is still relevant today - perhaps even more so as corporation conglomerates continue to gobble up all that we know. But the thing to remember is: While yes it is satire and it is far more over-the-top than real life, it carries with it a striking message. It carries with it the message that television is bad, plain and simple, a fact that now more than ever we need to be reminded of. This film very well hits the mark it aims for and while it does suffer at times from being hilariously unbelievable, this too allows it to hit it's mark. In short, this is a fine film - but be careful, it may have you screaming: ""I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!"". My rating 8/10",Network

His terrible life resulted in him being rid of his desire to conform, and this allowed him to speak out on his beef with corporate capitalism and their methods of exploitation.Everything Beale preaches about television, could be translated to modern day mediums. Especially relevant to social media which feeds us hours of nothingness.A notable monologue is spoken by Jensen, in his spiel towards Beale about the ""primordial forces of the world"". I think he represented the nature of the news, that shows shocking, vile events for ratings and depicts different countries and groups as abstract, far-away entities. ""There are no Arabs. There are no Russians. There are no third world countries"". His belief that money controls all further supports this.

I did not feel the tension and heavy emotions, except for the ending. The characters were monotone, even if the movie was more story driven than character driven. This movie was allowed to stay relevant due to it's discussion of problems that are still faced today- the fake mask of television. The movie did a 'good' job in delivering that message.

That's not to say that admirable TV programming no longer exists, but the power of Network and the brilliance of the performances by Finch and Dunaway is to show how easily the race for ratings can lead to something far more sinister than simple entertainment.

After watching the movie you might think Beale is enlightened after hearing his rants and monologues in the middle of the film, but for me Beale comes off as a nervous wreck who could easily be manipulated to do others bidding, which eventually leads to his inevitable death at the end of the film.

282,islander-14,He did it again.,9,26 September 2007,"Sidney Lumet is a Hollywood careerist whose imprint on his great corpus of work is so subtle as to be almost anonymous. Apart from being engrossingly valid and entertaining films it is hard to draw a thread between 12 Angry Men, Serpico, Equus, Network, Dog Day Afternoon and House of Games. This is a film maker who has that talent that eludes journalists the capacity to make his work look like it is without comment. And yet of course Sidney Lumet wants to tell us something all the time, he just wants to make sure he doesn't look like he is.This film is uncannily prescient. Decades before Jerry Springer and the other tragic bottoms of barrels American TV managed to reach; decades before the drama of Dan Rather's retirement and the feud with CBS and the ratings shifts before and after he left; before 'reality' television became a genre, there was Network. This is hardly a satirical look at the visceral innards of TV management. This is what today's TV would probably not hesitate to pass as a re-enactment of probable fact. Those last two words are admittedly contradictory but the literary tool of the oxymoron here, I believe, is perfectly legitimate.The story unfolds at a fourth fictitious nationwide network UBS where veteran newscaster Howard Beale competes for ratings with Walter Cronkite and the rest of the real and existing networks. The ratings keep failing and Beale is staring in the face of his retirement. His depression gives him a nervous breakdown and on live TV, a week before his last broadcast, he announces to his audience that a week later he would blow his brains out on the evening news.There's a spine-chillingly accurate telling of this scene. While he's speaking out to his live audience, the crew inside the mixer box completely miss this outburst. They're really only interested in the running order of tapes and graphic cuts and that timing is accurate to fit in with the advert breaks of the affiliates. I've been in one of those mixing rooms a few times. That's exactly how it works.Anyway Beale is being taken off the air but this is a time of changes in network management and the public's obvious interest in the spectacle of a rigid, cheerless newscaster they've known for 11 years parroting the news now gone completely insane on live TV is no reason to remove him for the new kids on the management. The old guard is represented by Max Schumacher who feels sympathy for Beale because he too is on the way out. UBS has been taken over by a new conglomerate and the heavy financial cost of the news-department needs now to be neutralised by the cuts and control of business-minded, ambitious and young Frank Hackett for whom 'the business of management is management' and news needs to fit under management.Frank Hackett is the new guard. Him and Diana Christensen. Now there are two characters for the movies. From this film everyone remembers Peter Finch playing Howard Beale 'mad as hell': that over-the-top hysteria that flirts with the limits of the audiences' psychological closure. But Robert Duvall and Faye Dunaway are also 'mad as hell'. These are the workaholic, performance-obsessed yuppies we know from every office. In the three-way scene when Hackett fires Schumacher (how well William Holden aged), Hackett's madness becomes transparent. As the prize of promotion to the corporation board is within his sight nothing would stop him: not the need to shout, to bully, even to kill.But Dunaway's Christensen is the ultimate yuppie. She is so engrossed by work that when Schumacher cannot take her obsession any more and leaves her he articulates the meaninglessness of her existence. 'There's nothing left in you that I can live with. You're one of Howard's humanoids. If I stay with you, I'll be destroyed. Like Howard Beale was destroyed. Like Laureen Hobbs was destroyed. Like everything you and the institution of television touch is destroyed. You're television incarnate, Diana: Indifferent to suffering; insensitive to joy. All of life is reduced to the common rubble of banality. War, murder, death are all the same to you as bottles of beer. And the daily business of life is a corrupt comedy. You even shatter the sensations of time and space into split seconds and instant replays. You're madness, Diana. Virulent madness. And everything you touch dies with you. But not me. Not as long as I can feel pleasure, and pain... and love.' That's the thing with this film. It's not afraid of words. It confronts the banality of television with the articulation of better cinema. Admittedly this is the world before The West Wing, 24, The Sopranos, Six Feet Under et alia.Check out Beatrice Straight's Oscar winning 5-minute performance as the scorned wife of Max Shumacher. Aided by competent writing, she brings out the complete arc of a character married for 25 years and abandoned for another woman within seconds of our first introduction: and we feel we've known her for ever.Sidney Lumet did it again.",Network

The network Howard Beale worked for exploited him for ratings, but it also showed how far the media is willing to go to get a ""story,"" whether it's manufactured falsehoods or a ratings grab.

At the time it came out television was a medium that although still new had grown into an enormous industry. Society as a whole been easily influenced by media, whether it be print or radio. but in the 1970s, television's power to influence was greater than no other. the screenplay for Network, written by Paddy Chayefsky, pulls no punches in its blistering critique on the transformation of television into a business- of the businesses that own the networks and use their power to sell rather than inform.The acting in this film is first rate. Peter Finch's performance of Howard Beale is over the top. A bland over-the-hill washed up anchor with dismal ratings becomes a ranting lunatic and turns into a network superstar. Faye Dunaway plays the soulless network executive who exploits Beale. Dunaway's character is representative of a generation that grew up on television- cold, unfeeling, completely programmed. William Holden plays Beale's friend who becomes corrupted and seduced by Dunaway.This film is perfect and so far ahead of its time. It foretold the danger of greed, of telling people what they wanted to hear rather than informing them. The power of television to influence and manipulate those who are easily influenced.",Network

None of the characters were particularly relatable or sympathetic, and a lot of the dialogue came off as unhinged yelling, which made it both unenjoyable to watch, and incredibly difficult to take seriously. Howard Beale started off as an interesting character with the potential to make a good, well-developed point about American society, but by the end of the film he became somewhat ridiculous and unconvincing, being convinced that he was a ""prophet"" and ""enlightened"". The character of Jenson is similarly difficult to watch, screaming and ranting like a madman in a setting that makes it seem like he is trying to brainwash Beale, and any point that he may have actually made is lost in the fact that his character seems to be essentially throwing a tantrum.

The views on this News Show got so high that the network decides to go back to Beale and ask him to have his own show were he can say his opinion and say what he wants to.Beale doesn't seem crazy, he says only things who are basically true, but he expresses them in a very energetic way, why he seems on other people often pretty crazy. He just seem to throughout mental break down, so he doesn't care about the consequences of his speeches.The film is still relevant, because it shows how a network just wants to make money, even when it just means that they ask a guy, who said he is going to kill himself, to get his own show. Also Beale's speeches on TV have a relevant point, he criticizes the media, how manipulating it can be and how attached the public is to it, what is still today relevant, even more with phones and computers.For me Network is a film, because I think that this movie really changed for me the way I am seeing a TV network. Also Beale's speeches are very important because they are still relevant today and really important because it is one of the rare times a movie actually faces the truth of the media and society.Jensen speech is convincing, but I don' agree with it.

He has no real motivations that make any sense, and this mental madness just came out of nowhere. Unlike people who are prophetic and have a real message inspired by hatred, passion or love.The movie is pretty relevant nowadays because it shows that the network just wants money and that they were happy to kill Beale as long as it meant them earning audience retention. It is almost like a mirror image of what society is like these days, with all of the big companies using people to make money, especially the general civilization.It is a movie because it doesn't have a real message.No, he is.

I believe that this movie is still relevant because it talks about a very modern problem, where technology and television are becoming the most influent and important things. Unlike films today, it portrays the message in such an uninteresting way with everything being said through dialogue and not told visually. There are many other ways a film can tell its message and story than just talking about it through the characters monologue/ dialogue.

The satire about the television network industry was far before its time but was out and out brilliant in several ways.  First and foremost, the cast is one of the best right up there with THE GODFATHER. Faye Dunaway, and William Holden lead an exceptional cast as the producers of a news show anchored by Peter Finch that becomes an overnight success when Finch's character, who we learn was fired at the beginning of the film, threatens to kill himself at the end of his last broadcast.  Dunaway is ambitious and perfect in every definition of the word; Finch is stunning as a psychotic broadcaster turned prophet; Holden depicts class and depth as a network executive; and other players, including Robert Duvall (new network executive) and Beatrice Straight (as Holden's wife who struggles to maintain her dignity after learning of her husband's infidelities) prove what great supporting roles can do. Paddy Chayefsky's play is absolutely flawless with biting satire, wit, and deep drama in every scene while director Sidney Lumet captures the world of the television industry with subtle perfection.

As over-the-top as Faye Dunaway's character might seem, she's actually a bit tame by Real Housewives standards, and even Peter Finch's suicidal maniac isn't as shocking as some of the suspects in police documentaries. Beatrice Straight received a surprise Supporting Actress Oscar for a brief performance, which created the same type of controversy as Luise Rainer and, later, Judi Dench. However, Straight's scene berating William Holden is one of many electrifying moments in ""Network"". In fact, many believe Holden and Finch should have tied for the Best Actor Oscar, a la Streisand and Hepburn in 1968, but Finch's death before the awards ceremony tipped the statue posthumously in his favor.

I endorse the later of the two because I believe things have changed since 1974 - I wasn't born yet, but I know because of my parents, the movies, literature, etc, etc, etc. Peter Finch as the mad prophet of the airwaves gives Chayefsky a riveting and powerful voice. The scenes between old chums Finch and William Holden are some of the best written scenes in any American movie until the Coen brothers emerged. Finch is superb, superb! and Holden, at the end of a legendary career, gives a performance of such ferocious sincerity that I rediscovered the man, the actor and felt the need to revisit some of his opus. From Golden Boy to Sunset Boulevard, Holden was a man who carried his own discomfort as a weapon. Extraordinary! However, the most alarming character in the whole thing is Faye Dunaway's. She is magnificent in her thin, nervous, bra-less attitude. She is a monster of commercial amorality. Everything in this incredible movie moves with the precision of an inspired clairvoyant's vision. Duvall's executive, Beatrice Straight's betrayed wife and Ned Beatty's god like big shot makes this one of the most frightening, entertaining, funniest, remarkable film from the 70's.

303,ashrich_13,Ideological state apparatuses,8,21 December 2008,"As part of mass media and the primary source of communication in the society, broadcast companies such as television and radio play a pivotal role as ISAs. They are mostly in the private domain, operate through persuasion (or in more intricate terms, through ideology) and are founded by material existence (broadcast stations and outlets). In the film, UBS is a seemingly ordinary television company which is considered as the ""fourth network"" (after CBS, NBC and ABC) and is radically losing in the ratings game. As a consequence, the opportunity that the executives of the company took illustrated the rabid measures that each partakes on to rate and subsequently profit from such programs. The industry initially depicted was that on a deteriorating streak, it is close to being shut down out of bankruptcy. So since every program on television is expected and assumed to sell good in both the audience and advertising markets, immediate program-cutting and redeveloping measures would surface. This is where to which came the idea of taking advantage of certain situations to supply the network with the profit needed for survival. Primarily in this instance, the sacrifice of responsible journalism in exchange of skyrocketing ratings through a novelty news show. There is an apparent depiction of the anchorman whom the network wanted us to believe was a critic ""denouncing the hypocrisies of our time"". In due course, he was portrayed as a puppet merely used and controlled to satisfy the audience's viewing pleasure. He was the industry's tool to regain its impetus and to redeem itself from being salvaged by low ratings and relatively lower advertising density. He was the sacrificial lamb, a test run for trial and error. He was materialized as a media product that is packaged to influence the audience but in reality, was cut off his own mental and emotional stance. What we could suppose in this film is that the ability of an ideology to persuade people into succumbing to certain beliefs was extremely obvious on the part of the anchorman and also on the role of the audience as the receiver. Both were lead into believing that one complex and profit-motivated idea is a projection of the truth  a truth that is tangible and impersonal. The capacity of the television industry to maneuver the faith of one person or social group into the creation of a hyperreality is a succulent perpetuation of an ideology built to transform and subject the society to a monocentric faith.",Network

306,smragan,Strongest recommendation I can give,10,27 December 2000,"Network is, for my money, a very nearly perfect movie.  If there is a defect, it is the sound quality.  In every copy of Network I've ever rented, owned, or otherwise seen, the mixing has, in places, been downright abysmal. Faye Dunaway's speech at the UBN stockholders' meeting is the place that first comes to mind--the audience applause sounds more like a jetliner warming up.  There is also a point, I think around the beginning of the third act, where a narrator's voice-over is pretty much drowned out by the sound of an airplane landing.  But these are minor distractions, really, from an otherwise-stunning film.  If there's a major drawback to this movie, it's that it goes over some folks' heads:  The dialogue is very smart and comes very quick.  The humor is often subtle and allusive, meaning that, for instance, you might need to know who Patty Hearst is, or have a clear understanding of Marxism, to get some of the jokes.  Also, this is a film that does not fear to violate the three-syllable rule.  Words like ""ecumenical"" abound.  But if you're a reasonably intelligent person and you like directors like Quentin Tarantino, or writers like David Mamet, who are not afraid of language, then you will probably love this movie.  A second caveat, however, would be that Network packs a strong political punch.  If you do not agree that television is the antichrist, then Network may seem to be a trifle loaded, like a piece of propaganda.  Even if you don't, however, I would still not hesitate to say that you, like everyone else, ought to see Network.  It is a film that deserves a response.",Network

Very few movies can match the depth and artistic craft of this cinematic work. Paddy Chayefsky's screenplay is magnificently sharp, tactful, and bold, attacking subjects that we don't enjoy talking about. Sidney Lumet's directing is magnificent from his lighting schemes to the masterful performances that he gained from his ensemble cast. There were six exceptional acting performances.

William Holden has never looked or sounded so impressive, and there's much to be admired in his performance as the callused, romantic Max. But I happen to be in the second camp. I love Finch as an angry prophet denouncing the hypocrisies of our times, on TV, in the florid language of a 5th Avenue bodhisattva. I can't overlook Max's tendency to roll out that tired anecdote about taking a taxi to the George Washington Bridge back in the 1950s, and what a fitting way it would be to open a memoir about the Golden Days of Television -- which is the very fate he ends up consigned to. I listen to him browbeat Diana Christensen about what a creature of TV she is, and yet can't help but cringe at how easily he slides into the role of the Unfaithful Husband (and how easily he's able to talk about that irony). All this suggests to me is that Chayefsky was unable to keep the one character he most identifies with from running away from him. Beale straddles the past and the future of television: an ""old man who thinks in terms of nations and peoples"" yet who also recognizes that the medium has not begun to know its limits -- and sets out blindly to find them. (They turn out to lie somewhere between corporate America and the FCC.) As a self-referential visionary, he anticipates some of the more rabid talk-show hosts of our own time, a kind of left-wing Bill O'Reilly. Well, now that I think about it, that's not much of an accomplishment, though it's fun to watch. The tragedy of ""Network,"" I guess, is that it's Diana Christensen who's ahead of them all: she's the real Sybil the Soothsayer, and when she sees the future of television, she sees Reality TV; yet as conceived by Chayefsky, she's brilliant, beautiful, and cold as a frozen dinner.",Network
316,Wannabetaxidriver,Among the best movies ever made.,10,2 July 2005,"Network was in 1976 a vicious satire on the media. It is the story of the first known instance of a man being assassinated because of lousy ratings. It has Peter Finch as Howard Beale, an anchorman who is being let go since his station is continually in 4th place in the Neilson ratings. After some drunken reminiscing with his best friend Max Schumacher, William Holden, giving the finest performance of his career, he comes to the conclusion that the best possible way for him to go out would be to kill himself on air, he says that it would bring in a 50 share on the ratings, at least. On his broadcast the next night, he announces his plan, but is made to retract it the next night, instead he confesses the truth; that he just ran out of bullshit. In an attempt at getting better ratings network executive Diana Christensen, Faye Dunaway, decides to keep Beale on as a freak attraction, ""The Mad Prophet of the Airwaves."" She puts him on followed by a reality show that broadcasts the acts of terrorists. Sidney Lumet's satire of mainstream American media contains what is one of the strongest ensemble casts in the history of movie-making. Peter Finch gives the best monologue in movie history about American culture, which includes the line that Network is best known for, recently named as the 19th best line in movie history by the AFI, ""I'm as mad as Hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!"" To counter his explosive performance is a much more subtle but equally impressive one by William Holden (Both of which received Best Leading Actor nominations from the Academy.) Robert Duvall is excellent as network executive Frank Hackett. Dunaway is phenomenal as a workaholic program director. I could go on about how brilliant and ahead of its time the Oscar Winning Screenplay is, but I'd rather ramble on about the films director, Sidney Lumet. In 1976, Lumet had the likes of 12 Angry Men, Fail-Safe, The Pawnbroker, Serpico and Long Day's Journey into Night under his belt. Network represented the high point in Lumet's career, with the combo it forms with the arguably superior Dog Day Afternoon, made a year prior. Both criticize the media, but Network does it far more directly. Aside from Daniel and The Verdict, Lumet has never come close to equaling the works of his early career, and at the age of 80, it's unlikely he ever will. With the duo of Dog Day Afternoon and Network, Sidney Lumet is arguably the only director to have made two of the best movies of the 1970's. While Al Pacino may have given us the best performance ever put on film in Dog Day Afternoon, the quintet of Peter Finch, William Holden, Faye Dunaway, Robert Duvall and Ned Beatty is arguably the best ensemble in a movie ever. **** (Out of ****)",Network

The cast and the direction are fine, but the overly philosophical script is what kills it for me. There is no subtlety, rather I feel as if I'm being beat over the head.

From Howard Beale's (Peter Finch) diatribes railing against the hypocrisies of our age, to Louise Schumacher's (Beatrice Straight) scathing response to her husband's extramarital affair, this movie cuts right to the bone. I have sometimes wondered how a movie with such a strong anti-media message was made by a large studio. Network was highly lauded critically. Check the all-star cast: Dunaway, Holden, Finch, Duvall; this film is a real gem and required viewing in my book.",Network
320,Gustav-11,I'm as happy as hell! and...,9,14 June 1999,"The greatness of a movie depends on its ability to move a human being into a particular state of mind, whether emotional or intellectual that is up to the creator of the script.  But alongside that, is the fruition of the vision, which is attained by the means of the director, production crew, designers, composers, and of course, actors.  Network is a movie that attains greatness on all levels.  Actually this movie's moved me to think that in its substance and presentation that it could be successful as a work of theatre.  I'm not talking about a below-mediocre rendition, but if it was consistent with the script, could produce what great plays have to offer. This movie makes no claim to great special effects or sweeping landscapes- just a great story based on Chayefsky's vision of the world of television.The signature line of this film is ""I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore.""  When it comes to the world of television, I think the viewer holds his/her own destiny in their remote control.  The story revolves around a suicidal news anchorman, Howard Beale (Peter Finch), who's reaction to being fired leads him to, first, reveal that he will commit suicide on the air, and second, to expose the demented philosophy of the cut-throat environment of television.  The premise of Chayefsky's script is an examination of the ethics of the programming in the television industry.  In my opinion the independent television viewer gets what they tune in to, the decision is theirs to make.  And to be ""as mad as hell"" means that the viewer sees no other alternative than sitting in front of the tube and taking only what it has to offer.  And as morbid as it sounds, I think that the occurrence of such a Beale-like figure would produce the same reaction in reality.  Can't you envision the ""enraged"" masses of people rallying behind such a loose cannon, who is virtually telling them to ""get mad"" about something that they already have means to overcome.  This movie touches upon the ideas of the current censure trends and will surely produce a anger inside oneself.  This movie is unlike anything produced in Hollywood, with exception of the rendition of Ayn Rand's Fountainhead, because it based only on ideas.  The content of this movie demands that the viewer to bring along their rational mind.Chayefsky has created a treatise that leads the individual to evaluate ones relationship to the television set.  Is it your guide to the outside world?  Is it your entertainment?  Is it the teacher of your political and spiritual philosophy?  Has it given meaning to your life?  If you have answered yes, ""you should be as mad hell"".  Don't take it anymore-- click it ""off"".",Network
321,endo23,"Eerily prescient, and fabulous despite its flaws",10,30 August 2004,"Network is indeed a prophetic film, but not because it predicts trends like Reality TV. This film functions like a black hole, sucking us along its inevitable spiral toward Ned Beatty's climactic speech about the death of Democracy and the emergence of Corporations as the new World Powers.Paddy Chayefsky isn't saying ""TV is evil""--TV is simply one example of capitalism's power to erode the cultural dialogue and rob us of our humanity. As in his screenplay for ""Hospital,"" Chayefsky is condemning the influence of money in those institutions which affect human lives the most, e.g. health care and the media. TV could be a massive educational tool; if you really reflect on the power of the medium itself, its global accessibility and reach, it's staggering to think what we've turned it into. Airwaves that belong to the public have been converted into endless advertisements for corporate sponsors, whether in 30 second spots or full-length ""branded"" content like MTV, which sells ""trendiness"" to an entire demographic of youthful consumers.""Hospital"" predicted the damaging effects privatized healthcare and frivolous lawsuits would have on our nation's medical institutions; ""Network"" displays the same eerie prescience about our mass media. Reality TV is the least of our concerns; take a look at Fox News. Millions of people are being misinformed daily about significant world events because a corporation with a bottom-line agenda is selling branded propaganda as ""fair and balanced"" news. If democracy is impossible without an informed electorate, an informed electorate is impossible without unbiased media--hence the current political crisis in America.In ""Network,"" Chayefsky is tying the political impotence and pent-up rage felt by Americans in the 1970s post-Vietnam and Watergate to mass media (TV being its prime component), but he's also using this lens to capture much larger issues, such as the corrosion of humanity in the modern world and capitalism's responsibility for much human suffering.These are the issues ""Network"" is grappling with, and if you can get over the silly Holden- Dunaway romance and the somewhat dull direction, there is a lot of terrifying brilliance to behold here. Paddy Chayefsky was an immensely talented writer, but the screen rarely does justice to his words. For my part, I'll take a flawed but brilliant film like ""Network"" over a dozen slickly-produced ""Titanic"" clones, which look incredible but offer only the most banal observations about the human condition.",Network
322,mutualcreation,Media money,9,27 February 2004,"Howard Beale is an old newsreader for the not-so-successful channel UBS. His view ratings are dropping dramatically and the bosses have all agreed to cut him loose, all but Max Schumacher, the head of the news broadcasting, who is an old friend of Howard. After hearing of his forced retirement he decides to say goodbye in a different way: during his last 'performance' on TV he, instead of reading the news, informs the viewer he's going to commit suicide. The bosses of UBS are furious, but a newcomer and professional b*tch Diana Christensen sees a great commercial hit in this new way of dealing with the news today.This main story forms the base of a magical dark comedy and drama picture directed by Sidney Lumet. A star cast filled with established actors received in 1977 the important prices at the Academy Awards, winning both the Oscar for best leading actor, won by Peter Finch in his role of the exuberant television prophet Howard Beale and the Oscar for best leading actress, won by Faye Dunaway, playing the professional business women, creating a prototype of modern television. Somehow Beatrice Straight even won the award for best female supporting actress, as the aging woman of Max Schumacher. Besides these, you got William Holden (Max Schumacher), Robert Duvall (Frank Hachett) and Ned Beatty as Arthur Jensen, all in good form.Apart from the terrific acting the movie delivers a great, but dramatic story of the evolution of the media system into a real killer machine (signified by Dunaway's character). In the beginning the story is quite funny and entertaining but when Howard has his first strike, you know this is more than a game, it's reality, just like Howard prophecies. Then the channel gets more and more aggravated, the public is aroused and evil has won the war, 'cause that's what the media has become: a bloody battle for money. The last shot of the film, when Howard has been shot by the communist revolutionaries (I even recognized Tim Robbins as one of the shooters), is bitter and absolutely horrifying. The prophecy has become reality.This weird mix of comedy and drama is just the way I feel about modern television: I can laugh with it because of its stupidity, but on the other hand it is sad that more than a half of the population of my country (Belgium) is watching this crap. The comedy of the movie is sometimes achieved in tiny things. I love the fact that Howard is from the start of the picture on saying he's going to kill self because of the system, but in the end it is the system that kills him. Powerful filming and strong acting create a bitter good film. Just go and rent or even buy this one!",Network
323,Grumpy_Old_Man,"Exploring the personal, political, and social ramifications of modern media, ""Network"" is a knockout.",10,5 May 2007,"(Spoilers) It's hard to describe the impact of this film, or what it means for us as humans in 2007, in a single sitting. Suffice to say, Network sums up the spirit of the modern age perfectly. The script paints a cynical vision of the industrial era with such roaring fury and precision, it would be difficult to not be bowled over by it's intensity. Peter Finch plays news anchor Howard Beale to a T, that throughout his cathartic rants on the state of the nation, with its' increasingly brainwashed and dehumanised population, he walks the tightrope between the prophetic and the insane perfectly, echoing our deepest collective responses to the tragedies of today whilst pointing to the solution. On the smaller scale, in portraying a couple in disconnect, Faye Dunaway and William Holden engage the heart, even as they fail to relate and finally crumble into the void. There are many classic individual moments - ""I just ran out of bullsh*t"", ""You have meddled with the primal forces of nature!"", ""You're television incarnate"", and yes ""I'm as mad as hell"". Crystalline dialogue to be sure, but it's the icing on the cake for a movie with such tremendous guts, heart and soul, that rare commodity: a film that dares to give a damn about those who watch it.Along with ""Bulworth"" and ""Videodrome"", everyone should see this.",Network
324,flood-eamonn,More Relevant in the Internet Age,8,27 March 2013,"""The first casualty of war is the truth"". It's often the case that the first casualty of everything is the truth. Opinion, slant, bias: we add them to stories as soon as we hear them, even if we do so inadvertently. It's almost as if reality exists without and for us to take it in it must be processed and truncated into information that we can understand... and this is never going to be an accurate representation of the real. It's not common that a huge effort is made to resist this irresistible phenomenon and, more often than not, plenty of consciously-added changes are made. The credulous and malleable have always been receptive to facile, convenient messages and our herd mentality means that all but the most stubborn will eventually be worn down and submit to the accepted truths of their societies. This is as true today as it was before verbal communication, but the potential audience for such messages has arguably increased with the advent of new means of communication: language, the written word, the printing press, television, mass media... and the internet.Getting back to the film, it was made before the modern internet existed (its precursor, the ARPANET was only declared operational in 1975). If anything, Network is more relevant today than it was in 1976: the internet may be open to everyone (so it's not a handful of TV execs deciding what you see) but it is as much a source of disinformation as it is of information. The plethora of poorly-informed individuals shouting their opinions from the routertops is not unlike the street preaching scene from The Life of Brian. Information and freedom are great things but if you aren't circumspect and check your facts then you could be a victim of the global misinformation flu (which could mean anything from you repost some made-up story on facebook to you send a guy in Scamdonia your bank account details). Racism, prejudice and all sorts of other assorted bits and pieces are part of the make-up of each individual and these are exhibited for all to see in the opinions that they spread (""It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors."" - Oscar Wilde). Also from Mr Wilde: ""Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault."" Those who disseminate the news, whether by word of mouth, in the newspapers, on television or on the internet should consider such words before they commit thought to medium. As you see in Network, many are perfectly aware of what they are doing, and don't care, so it's more important that those on the receiving end filter the information that they imbibe carefully.Where Network is particularly relevant in modern life is how information is controlled and distributed. Internet censorship is becoming a bigger issue with each passing year. The great firewall of China may not be coming to an exchange near you any time soon, but it is worth being cautious of the various ""legitimate"" reasons western democracies are increasingly using to control the lines of communication. Some of these reasons are not things people can really argue for (e.g. child pornography in Australia) but it is legitimate to question the need to control the ability to communicate. Sure, pursue criminals who commit crime, but the slow erosion of the freedoms of the internet because of copyright infringement, online bullying and so on shows that the people in charge don't know what the internet is about. ""Technology is neither good nor bad, nor is it neutral"" (Kranzberg's First Law of Technology). The internet is what it is and can be used to control or to freely spread information. In its current state it is up to the reader to decide. Hopefully there will be no need to remake Network in future to warn about the internet as a tool solely for use by those in control.Network is a film both of its time and ahead of its time. Like Nineteen Eighty-Four, its message will always be relevant as long as we continue to communicate. Only if this ceases to happen will the film start to feel dated. Then all we're left with is a wonderfully-acted, well-written and entertaining film!",Network

The writing can seem faintly pretentious, but this is out of the recurrent demand stories contain the same quips as realism. This isn't a Thomas Pynchon story, but it also isn't meant to give a glimpse of the 'true' business world of television broadcasting like The Newsroom was crafted to do. To best explain what epitomizes this film: It's redolent of Kurt Vonnegut's theme in the novel God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, but a greater emphasis put into Eliot Rosewater as both a resonant demagogue and more estranged to his surroundings.

330,avinashnow,Great Performances make up a great movie,8,14 June 2006,""" I am mad as hell....."" . Well , well, well this is what everyone catches from the movie. There are some more which I was able to get hold of. First things first, I guess the best actor for the movie should have gone to William Holden ( Max Scahumacaher) instead of Peter Finch. The reason.... Peter Finch was portraying a cranky guy who is an angry messiah and also has eloquence as one of his strengths. I do not think he did have to do much change in any emotion he had to display because they had to be simply put, the emotion of an eccentric guy. ... William Holden shows the crisis which he is going through both in his personal life and professional life and how one crisis effects the other. That transformation alongwith his natural vulnerability towards Love and in the end walking over the one whom he loved back to the one who loved him is awesome. But amongst everyone, the most thoroughly deserved Oscar is for Faye Dunaway. Have seen Shabana Aazmi do a minuscule bit for the movie "" Main Azaad Hoon"" but nothing like Faye Dunaway. She is mean, very business like and always hooked on to rating even in her most intimate times. The great thing in the movie which Sidney Lumet has achieved is giving everybody their screen space and coming out with knock out performances by everyone. Paddy's screenplay is one of the best which I have ever witnessed in a movie so very much focused on Drama. Actually speaking, we could have had a stage play on this screenplay as well, its that good.One disaapointment, this movie lost out to guess which movie in that year.... ROCKY.

This was based on the recommendations of the people here (@ IMDB) who mostly liked it.I did not like it. Although it got a good deal of critical acclaim and praise when it was released, I find too many faults in this picture.To say that the pacing of the movie is slow is an understatement. The characters seem to drag from scene to scene as if they are reluctant to move.The characters themselves, are wooden. They are filled with greed, ambition, and disgust. It almost like I am reading F. Scott Fitzgerald's ""The Great Gatsby"". Even Peter Finch's rantings (While good at first) start to tire the viewer after a while.  It seems as if the director wants to make the ideas so clear to the viewer that he bludgeons the audience with the repeated dialogue... Subtly is not part of this movie.
I think that a good point that someone pointed out was that all the script is is a continuing set of monologues. People in this movie are not saying lines of dialogue they are saying commentaries. The social points and ideas are heavy handed.They are forced into the viewers face as if to say ""This is what the media is.""We as a culture have come to accept Media as a crazy circus. (Take the OJ trial for instance). We see it not only has a benevolent father (Tom Brokaw) but as a Crazy uncle (Jerry Springer) as well.  The (Heavy-Handed) social commentaries of this film fall on deaf ears in this jaded and media-saturated society.

The plot, and the broadcasting world put on frank display, is (to use a clichéd phrase) eerily prescient of today's TV climate of corporate merges and (ridiculous) reality programming. When Faye Dunaway's ambitious and wispily beautiful programming exec, Diana Christensen, pitches an actual-footage lead-in to a drama about guerilla bank robbers to her colleagues, they balk  but we aren't shocked. Audiences in 1976 most likely scoffed at this idea just as these characters do, but in our creatively sucked-dry world of non-scripted Fear Factors and Survivors, it sounds like a ratings magnet. And Diana is right  it scores. The film does ride the line between the ridiculous (or satiric) when urban terrorists become producers of this show, and make demands of the TV suits with wild rants and violence, and when mad-as-hell news anchor Howard Beale (played by a thinner, edgier Peter Finch) turns his authentic one-time rant against all that is wrong with life into a production where he ""faints"" at the apex of his Dennis Miller-meets-TV evangelist soliloquies.Watch Network to be wowed by the language of the characters. (Strangely, the sparse voice-overs contradict the crackling intelligence of these TV-land players with dry, monotone authority.) Watch it to appreciate the acting of a generation since replaced by less impressive stars. You'll wonder if Chayevsky employed a psychic when he wrote this amazing script. The tagline ""Television will never be the same!"" is a prediction, two decades early, of the onslaught of dreck that has in fact transformed television into a wasteland of envelope-shoving, outlandish programming.",Network

It is a really masterpiece.
Love story between woman and adult man, career desire, money, control of the masses.
After 1 hour and 28 minutes of vision you are faced with a disconcerting revelation if referred to 1976: ""the whole world is governed by immutable and ruthless laws of business.""

342,freaksofnurture,Network,10,17 November 2019,"You have to admire the lengths that some people go to in the pursuit of art. In July 2016, the Republican Party formally nominated Donald J Trump as their leader, purely in homage to the 1976 satire, Network. Trump won the ensuing presidential election, having successfully consolidated the votes of flat earthers and garden variety alike. Republican senators, now in control of both the House and Senate, had successfully engineered a scenario where they could pursue several decades' worth of extreme right-wing policies with impunity. All they had to do was use the idiot-in-chief as an epic filibuster to preoccupy news broadcasters, who themselves had facilitated Trump's rise over the years through their frivolous coverage. Network had served Republican senators all too well as an instruction manual for world domination via satire. In the meanwhile, they were seemingly happy to have been hoisted by their own retard.Network (1976), a movie about populism and the commodification of news media into a cheap entertainment product, is more prognostic than prophetic, more canny than uncanny. Network's screenwriter, Paddy Chayefsky, has rendered a brilliantly realized dissolution of society in slow mode. The satire of Network is lucid and down-to-earth; the events that transpire are entirely believable, and the film rarely reaches for a broader set of strokes. If anything, Network's disturbingly resonant qualities make our current predicament seem like a badly wrought cartoon by comparison.Following a series of stressful events in his personal life, veteran newscaster Howard Beale begins to lose his grip on reality. During an evening broadcast, Beale, in a kiss-off to his corporation, informs viewers that he'll be committing suicide live on the air in the following week. Predictably, Beale's deviation from his script attracts a large media interest. In an act of professional courtesy, longstanding News Division President, Max Schumacher (William Holden), allows Beale an opportunity to return to the air the next week to deliver a dignified farewell. Beale promises to reign himself in, but once again uses his segment to launch into a foul-mouthed tirade. The network is currently undergoing a takeover from a third party, and the internal dynamics of the corporation are in a state of flux. Schumacher is feeling the strain of the subsequent push and pull, and in a cavalier move aimed at aggravating his new bosses allows Beale the space to rant unimpeded, live on the air.The powers-that-be are incensed and initially fire Schumacher. However, it's brought to their attention that Beale's escapades have increased their viewing figures exponentially. Mindful of their historically poor ratings and an increasing black hole of a deficit, the execs decide to throw caution to the wind and keep Beale on. They revamp Beale's show and he effortlessly slips into his new guise as a prime-time prophet and dispenser of truths. Beale's righteous indignation attracts a huge audience share, and subsequently 'The Howard Beale Show' becomes one of the nation's most-watched shows, alongside The Six Million Dollar Man, All in the Family and Phyllis. Not bad at all for a current affairs news show.Despite Schumacher's obvious concern for Beale's fragile mental state, he isn't immune to the charms of career psychopath Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway), an attractive and young network department head, who largely steers the network's radical shift in tone. Diana, sensing that viewers have been left feeling anesthetized by Watergate and the recession, further pollutes the network's brand by inviting far-left political activists onto the network's current affairs slot, in a bid to profit off the back of the populist outrage that Beale has stoked. From this point, a merger between two formerly compartmentalized and separate entities, entertainment and current affairs, results in a slow-moving coup across the network. The ramifications are huge.Beale, Schumacher and Christensen are the main focal points of the movie. However, Network is essentially a movie about structures and systems, more than individuals. In essence, the three main characters are chess pieces who move in a series of calculated yet fluid movements, on a chess board where the rules are continuously changing. Despite such a convoluted backdrop, Network is a masterfully plotted movie that remains engaging throughout. Schumacher's romantic subplot, which could've come across as only tangentially relevant, serves as a further expansion of the film's main thesis. Through Max and Diana's affair we see evidence of a pernicious media culture that has infiltrated the interpersonal lives of a generation succored on the tube. Their relationship has a meta quality and both characters operate with a high degree of self-awareness which, given the deftness of the satire, never feels contrived. During a board meeting confrontation with Diana, Max demonstrates his frustration with the new network culture and a world that from his veteran eyes seems to have turned upside-down: 'My God, I'm supposed to be the romantic. You're supposed to be the hard-bitten realist.'With the public largely on his side, Beale begins to bite the hand that feeds him by shining a light on the network's reliance on Saudi money, which is being used to keep the franchise afloat. This is obviously a delicate matter for network bosses, and after drawing public attention to this potential conflict of interest, Beale is confronted by network chairman, Arthur Jensen (Ned Beatty). In an attempt to keep the pliable and unhinged Beale in check, Jensen delivers a blistering argument about the practical necessity of laissez faire economics and cut-throat corporatism, with threatening overtones. Jensen's argument is logical and rational, and as he casually decimates the concept of democracy to espouse instead the glories of globalism and deregulation, he very nearly convinces us to switch allegiances too: 'You get up on your little 21-inch screen and howl about America, and democracy. There is no America; there is no democracy. There is only IBM, and ITT, and AT&T, and DuPont, Dow, Union Carbide, and Exxon. Those are the nations of the world today.'Network documents a moment of transition where the chips have yet to fall. Beale, as a damaged, standalone actor, essentially manages to generate a power vacuum that metastasizes throughout an entire nation. Towards the end of the movie, Beale's ratings begin to fall, reflecting his newfound allegiance with the status quo. Jensen pays no mind to the falling ratings and is largely happy with his new propaganda source, yet Christensen, still seeking to expand her sphere of influence, has other ideas. Christensen and her team conspire to have Beale shot dead live on the air by the same band of political activists who they'd previously platformed. In the movie's post-script, Beale's murder is reported amid a duplex of TV screens. Coverage of his death is crowded out by hi-gloss commercials and other frivolous broadcasts. This post-script encapsulates the high degree of artistry on display throughout the movie as a whole in a single image.
This is a film for grown-ups; a top-rate satire that never kowtows or takes its own audience for granted. In today's deranged political climate, it's difficult to transplant Howard Beale, who transmits to a predominately middle-brow 1970s audience, into the role of a Wolf Blitzer type. In today's climate, Beale's brand of righteous indignation would more directly translate to a Tucker Carlson or Sean Hannity type. And when a movie's apocalyptic premise seems undersold in comparison with real life, you know that the world's heading for trouble.",Network

Howard Stern, reality shows, 24, Lost, Deal or No Deal, they all owe their success to the same insanity that Howard Beale(Peter Finch)==lam basts throughout this film.To really appreciate NETWORK, you must believe that the catch phrase from the film is real and never can be changed about the inner workings of not only broadcast television but when you listen to the insight about life, government and our country and actually ponder the reality of the dialog and how it does play today. That was 1976 after Watergate and the winding down of Vietnam...this is now after 9-11 and the war in Iraq which is dividing us up as intensely as Vietnam did then. So yes Howard Beale and those in today's ilk..""we are mad as hell and we are not going to take it anymore..."" And when they use the term the ""Arabs"" and their involvement in the media ..it sends cold chills down your spine considering our current war in the Middle East.Perhaps NETWORK should be required watching prior to entering our voting booths in November and see the results.But all in all, I would love a script of the entire dialog to ponder and reflect on ....Paddy did a helluva job and Faye Dunaway, William Holden and Peter Finch made it a cinematic gem not to be missed!",Network
345,sobotkajc,The sub-plot was Beale,9,2 September 2002,"Movies like Taxi Driver and Network belong together.  You may stone me now, but the theme of Network, like Taxi Driver, revolves around alienation.
POSSIBLE SPOILERFinch's remarks can be boiled down to this theme, specifically why he threatens suicide; without his job, his life is meaningless.  Of course this is drowned out by his rage, rage at everyone and everything, much like the line after, ""You talking to me?"" in Taxi Driver.No, the plot revolves around Dunaway's character - amoral, ambitious, and without a genuine place in society, and her foil, the seduced Holden. Dunaway is alone in a self-created world with a sole goal of the acquisition of ratings.  She practically has an orgasim in the office describing her ideas for the Mao Tse Tung Hour, and later she climaxes to it.  Her world is the office, no need for a personal life.Holden exists in that world too, but he knows it's just a job.  Throughout Holden brings this world of memories, feelings, and real life to the office, to his home, to his friends, and to Dunaway, and this is where the value of the movie goes beyond its surface of a prophetic warning about declining TV standards.  Here we have a clash of world-views, Montaigne vs. Marx: one says that man is more than the sum of his parts, the other denies precisely that.  Maybe it's her youth, maybe he sees potential, but Holden tries to save Dunaway from herself.  Dunaway can't see her problem, she believes life is a story line, as though it's nothing to be concerned about; I see her one day shouting from the rooftops, ""I'm mad as H---, and I'm not going to take it anymore,"" as she comprehends her situation, but until she understands that life is more complex than a Tolstoy novel, Holden can't help her.

My friend immediately suggested this movie, which I had never heard of. All of our other classmates immediately picked Anchorman:The Legend of Ron Burgundy. After watching this movie, Ron Burgundy needs to bow before Howard Beale, ""The Original Anchorman."" Even though this movie was made 33 years ago, its relevance to today's cutthroat broadcasting system is really eerie.Paddy Chayefsky's Oscar-winning screenplay was seeing the future with the most disturbing clarity. The acting was superb by all of the cast(even though I did note the abnormal shouting matches throughout the movie, ha), it was riveting to see a network and its reporters go mad with ratings and lose their humanity in order to be the #1 show on television, even if it meant killing off one of their own.Howard Beale (Peter Finch) is an aging TV anchorman for UBS who is fired, effective in two weeks, after his ratings have been steadily deteriorating. He reacts to this by sensationally announcing on live television his intent to commit suicide on air. In doing so, Beale becomes a major TV icon and one of the most valuable assets to the Communications Corporation of America (CCA), the company that is gradually taking control of UBS. As a result he is given his own show as 'the mad prophet of the air-waves'. He appears live on television every week-day evening to tell the real truth to the people of America. The program is a huge success but Beale uses his power to make startling revelations about CCA, leaving the company executives with a serious problem. Beale ultimately ends up going too far with his tirades upon discovering that the conglomerate that owns UBS will be bought out by an even larger Saudi Arabian conglomerate. Beale launches an on-screen tirade against the two corporations, encouraging the audience to telegram the White House with the message, ""I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take this any more!"" in the hopes of stopping the merger. This throws the network into a state of panic due to the company's various debts making the merger necessary in order for it to survive. The execs want Beale off the air in order to salvage what the network, but the chairman of UBS wants to keep him on. The execs realize that the only way that they can get of Beale is by assassinating him on the air.Wow, what a movie. The acting and directing of this film definitely made my Mass Communications project a memorable one. Not to mention I now know what AFI's #19 Most Memorable Quote is now from.

In ""Network"" I did not empathize with anyone, I did not hate anyone, I did not have that typical movie feeling of sharing thoughts or something with any character.
All the characters are shouting, yelling, screaming ALL the time, specially Peter Finch and Faye Dunaway. Also, all the characters have something like a speech (That they repeat several times) saying how the world works according to them. But that is too literal, a character doesn't necessarily need a speech saying what he thinks, he can show it with her actions and the audience will understand.
Maybe the plot of this movie was very original at the time but nowadays we all know the crazyness for ratings on TV. There are several much better things to watch about this subject: Black Mirror's episodes 'The Waldo Moment' (Wich is one of the worst for me) and Fifteen Millions Merits, Nightcrawler (With Jake Gyllenhaal being more crazy than Faye Dunaway's character), etc.

To say that shows like the Mao Zedong Hour (the Ecumenical Liberators' show) 'would never be on television' is missing the entire point. Nowadays, we compare what happens in the real world to what happens in the movies and television. We don't need something exactly like the Mao Zedong hour on TV now to prove that this movie is telling the truth about things; what's on TV has already screwed us up enough.After 9/11, how many times did you hear people describe the catastrophe as ""something like what's in the movies."" Well where do you think the movies got it from!?!? Reality! What's real is no longer as prominent as what we see on the screen, because we see the screen more than we see the real. Shows like ""When Animals Attack"" may not screw people up in small doses, but the fact of the matter is that shows like that are all we see today. That's it. Animals attacking people, people attacking people... and none of it is staged, supposedly... it's all real life. But what's the difference, really? What's real to us is what's on the screen. It is the hyper-real. Better than real. A replacement for the real.The soap opera romance was supposed to be a soap opera romance, because that's the only type of romance that exists. This is a pretty general statement, so take it with a grain of salt, but then again, try to think about a relationship you know of that doesn't fit this mold. Are there any relationships out there that aren't as made for TV as the next? Is everything made for TV? Or is it made BY TV?I offer no explanation of these phenomena, only the angles that this movie was produced from.

Nonetheless, I loved this movie.In my experience, I have heard quite a few complaints about this movie. I believe that these complaints are why Network is not on the Top 250 today (June 10, 2007; Network has a rating of 8.0/10 with 15,319 votes). These complaints include: -the movie is too ""slow"" -Chayefsky's monologues are unrealistic -the film is irrelevant today -you can't relate to such a movieWell, in this comment, I would like to dispute such complaints. I will admit that the movie is somewhat slow, but what do you expect? It is a movie about the corporate greed of the television network. It is not a ""dumbed-down"" Tom Cruise action movie. Besides, each scene matters to the plot. If someone tried editing this movie, they wouldn't find many parts they could edit. I find a certain intelligence in each scene.People say that Chayefsky's monologues are unrealistic. They complain that ""no one talks like that in real life"". I beg to differ. I can think of many times where I went on and on in a monologue to strengthen and add support to my opinion. In fact, this whole comment is a monologue, written to debate and support my opinion, much like Chayefsky's monologues in the movie.People also say that the movie is irrelevant today. This is the most outrageous complaint out of all of the complaints. This movie is more relevant today than it was in the 70s. Many very unsophisticated people gather ALL of their ""information"" (mostly propaganda) from the television. And the television networks today manipulate their audiences to think the way they want them to think.Lastly, people complain that you cannot ""relate"" to such a movie. Well, I hope you can't relate to the movie. I hope that you are not a greedy, selfish television network manager. Unfortunately, in essence, you CAN relate. People may not be television network managers, but we have all felt greed and egoism. Think about The Godfather. You may like the movie, but how are you supposed to relate to a mob boss? That's not the point. You are comparing the mob's structure with society's structure; that is how you relate.In conclusion, these complaints have no strong basis. At least rent the movie.

362,analiyahgalotti,Truth,8,20 June 2017,"I love this movie... I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!! What an amazing phrase to yell out into the sky! 70s vibe... I never thought about blocking of actors until I saw this movie. The story and message are amazing... but so is the blocking! They find really interesting ways of moving actors to new positions in the middle of conversations just to mix things up, change the power play in the scene. Masterfully done really! Cinematography compositions are beautiful... If you have a big TV, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND WATCH IT BIG!! The monologues dished out over the airwaves are prophetic, angry, hilarious, and true. I recommend showing this movie too all kids now to help them see that they shouldn't just believe anything ""the tube"" tell them.",Network
363,pioushaddockuk,welcome to the 2020s,10,22 June 2020,Who would have thought this movie could hold and so well 45 years later. Not only that but the level to which it is accurate has become increasingly correct as each decade went on. I genuinely fear for the future of the West based on how 2020 has begun!,Network
