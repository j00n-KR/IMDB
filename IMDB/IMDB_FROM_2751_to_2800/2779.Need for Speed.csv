0,Leofwine_draca,Another nonsense car racing film,3,1 August 2017,"NEED FOR SPEED is a dreadful addition to the 'car race' genre of movie-making, one that's based on a popular video game series. It's not as bad as the worst I've seen, SPEED RACER, but it's still largely unwatchable and totally clichéd from beginning to end. A film which dumbs down the story to the lowest common denominator at every point. Aaron Paul gives a rubbish, workmanlike turn as the supposed hero of the piece, while Dominic Cooper is the supposed villain but is far more charming than Paul. The less said about the token and embarrassing role for Imogen Poots, the better. There are a lot of racing scenes here but they all seem to end with the same CGI car flipping stunt and they quickly become tiresome. Give me the outlandishness of the FAST & FURIOUS franchise over this nonsense any day of the week.",Need for Speed
1,SnoopyStyle,overly complicated writing,5,8 March 2015,"Tobey Marshall (Aaron Paul) runs his dead father's small garage in Mount Kisco, New York. He street races his car against rival Dino Brewster (Dominic Cooper). His ex Anita Coleman (Dakota Johnson) is now going with Dino getting away from the small town. Dino hires him to finish his Mustang for a quarter of its $2 million price. Car broker Julia Maddon (Imogen Poots) agrees to buy it if the car gets close to 230 mph. Dino proposes to race Tobey and Anita's brother Pete for their commission on the car. Dino hits Pete's car killing him and drives away. Tobey is left holding the bag as he and Pete are blamed for stealing Dino's two race cars. Tobey spends 2 years in prison. Julia is able to get Tobey the Mustang as he tries to enter the underground road race De Leon run by the eccentric Monarch (Michael Keaton).It's has some great car street racing. I especially like the real stunt driving and the beautiful cars. The story is a convoluted mess. This should be an easy 'Cannonball Run' with great car racing. Instead, it's overly complicated. Imogen Poots tries to be funny but Aaron Paul doesn't seem to want any part of it. The only exception is the helicopter ride. If only they could take the cars and attach the car stunts to a better written story, this could have been a good fun movie. Also Michael Keaton is as annoying as heck in this.",Need for Speed
2,Prismark10,Speed Racing,4,6 August 2014,"Need for Speed is a silly film but is harmless fun if you leave your brain on off.I guess the film bears little resemblance to the video game apart from some cool sports cars, racing, spectacular crashes with added fireballs and a revenge plot. It is also overlong and very, very silly.Aaron Paul is bland and dull as the ace racer and mechanic who ends up being framed for the death of his friend during a road race with rival Dominic Cooper. Somehow Cooper managed to escape from liability for the death by saying he was not involved in the race and no witnesses or CCTV footage mentioned three cars racing.When he leaves jail he wants to take him on in a secret road race in California. Somewhere along the line Michael Keaton calls the shots as some kind of guru like illegal road race DJ.Once the car race gets going the film does gather speed but its nowhere near the standard of the Fast and Furious franchise. Paul's associates are all quirky stereotypes, the plot is nonsense and so is some of the racing but it does have some fun elements, if only the lead actors just camped it up and treated as nonsense this could had been better.",Need for Speed
3,nogodnomasters,ANITA CAR,6,3 August 2018,"Dino (Dominic Cooper), the darling of Mt. Kisco, NY races formula cars. Everyone knows Toby (Aaron Paul) is a better racer, although he just street races...except for maybe Anita (Dakota Johnson) his ex-gf who now travels with Dino. Through a series of impossible circumstances, Toby gets arrested for stealing Dino's uncle car, which he didn't. Upon getting out of jail, he will travel from NY to California in 45 hours aka ""Smokey and the Bandit."" Imogen Poots takes the role of Sally Fields. He is going to participate in an unsanctioned, ""winner take all"" pink slip race. Oh yes, he is on parole too and can't leave NY and must drive three times the speed limit to make it in time. He doesn't quite make it by ground and needs to be lifted by a friend in a helicopter for the last leg...something they should have done to begin with. He now must face Dino in the race.This whole script was stupid. The first thing any investigator wants to know about a stolen vehicle is ""Where are the keys?"" The idea that hot chicks hang out at a drive-in for local race drivers instead of texting their bff all night is old school and made me ask, ""When was this film made?"" Dino is a great philosopher, ""Forget the past. It's history."" He also makes up all kind of ridiculous Anita puns. They also have an aircraft fly overhead for safety, i.e. let them know when there is traffic, but that information didn't seem to effect their driving as they sped through red lights in a cop-less town.The personalities ranged from bland to bad. 130 minutes of mostly car action, not much in the way of building a believable tale.
A preteen or young teen film. A tad more believable than ""Death Race 2000"" but not nearly as entertaining.Parental Guide: No f-bombs. No sex. Male rear nudity.",Need for Speed
4,kosmasp,Furious for a reason,7,29 August 2014,"And since it's need for speed they have to be fast, right? So while this is based on the game it feels like Fast & Furious light. That's not necessarily a bad thing (especially after reading someone comparing this to Vehicle 19 ... no way, sorry, but that's doing injustice to this movie, even if you don't like it).So Aaron Paul might have had a better/juicier role in Breaking Bad, but you cannot compare the TV show with this one and try to judge it with those standards. You might not like or enjoy many of his (or Bryan Cranston movies). The story is pretty simple, there is not that much to it, but the action/chases are filmed nicely and isn't that what this is about mostly anyway? That depends on you, of course ...",Need for Speed
5,Tweekums,Simple plot but great car action,8,13 June 2017,"Tobey Marshall owns a garage on Mount Kisco, New York where he tunes high performance cars with his friends. He isn't too pleased when Dino Brewster, a rival from his racing days, turns up but he has an interesting offer; he wants Tobey to repair a Ford Shelby Mustang that he wants to sell for up to three million dollars; a quarter of which would go to Tobey. After the work is completed Tobey demonstrates just how fast the car is; this impresses car buyer Julia Maddon but not Dino as he thought he should test drive the car. Dino challenges Tobey to a street race to find out who is really the fastest driver, they are joined by Tobey's friend Pete and race in three Koenigsegg Agera R supercars. Tobey is set to win as Pete is preventing Gino from overtaking, Gino rams him causing the car to flip off the road and explode. Gino leaves the scene leaving Pete to go to jail for involuntary manslaughter.Two years later Tobey is released and wants revenge by beating him in the 'De Leon'; an illegal supercar race where the victor gets to keep all of the cars. If he is to participate he will have to have to get a car, get a race invitation and get to California in under forty eight hours. He gets the car when Julia turns up in the Shelby Mustang. She insists on going with him and they quickly set off with Tobey's friend Benny flying overhead to check on traffic. Along the way they pick up friends Joe and Finn who drive their support vehicle. Just getting to California will be a problem; Dino has offered his rare Lamborghini to anybody who stops Tobey and they also have to stay ahead of the police. There problems are far from over when they get to California.I had heard that this film was a bit rubbish. To be honest that is a bit unfair; sure it isn't going to win any Oscars and the plot is very predictable but when it comes to the action it really delivers. Even if, like me, you aren't a car expert you can see that the cars that feature are something special. The races are exciting and the crashes are spectacular and realistic rather than the CGI enhanced fake action we see in so many films these days. The cast do a solid enough job; notably Aaron Paul as Tobey and Imogen Poots as Julia. Dominic Cooper's Gino is a bit of a pantomime villain but that isn't out of place in a film such as this; similarly Michael Keaton's characters, race organiser 'Monarch' is over-the-top and a bit bizarre but still entertaining. Overall I'd say I enjoyed this far more than I expected; the story might be predictable but the execution kept me gripped from start to finish; I'd certainly recommend it to fans of the genre.",Need for Speed
6,paul_haakonsen,"Fast cars, shallow plot...",6,9 June 2018,"If you liked ""Fast and Furious"" movies, then you will definitely also like ""Need For Speed"".The movie had a fairly good cast, except for Aaron Paul whom seemed very unfit for a role such as that. It was nice to see Dominic Cooper, Michael Keaton and Rami Malek perform in the movie though.There is lots of fast car scenes throughout the course of the movie, although they were rather unrealistic much like ""Fast and Furious"".Funny how there weren't any police or state troopers along the ride, all the way to California, especially since they were driving so fast all the time.""Need for Speed"" suffers from a very predictable storyline and it was rather shallow in contents. But other than that, it was actually good brainless fun and entertainment.",Need for Speed

9,neil-476,This non-car fan enjoyed it,8,14 March 2014,"Tobey Marshall spends two years in prison following the death of a friend in an illegal high stakes road race, having been stitched up by weaselly competitor Dino. On his release he has an opportunity to exact repayment in another race, but this involves driving across the country in the unwelcome company of posh Brit bird Julia, and in the face of Dino offering a bounty to stop him.Let me start by making it clear that I am not a car enthusiast. I have no interest in them beyond the wish that mine keeps working. But I enjoyed this film (which is based on a video game which I don't imagine will ever cross my path). There are absolutely no surprises in it, but the characters are engaging (Aaron Paul as Tobey and Imogen Poots as Julia are both likable, and Domic Cooper is pleasingly slimy as Dino), and the action is well staged with one or two ""Wow!"" sequences. The 3D is often, but not always, effective: I would regard it as non-essential although, if you are a car enthusiast, a 3D viewing will enhance your enjoyment.I was far from convinced that the police would fire a squad car at a road racing car in order to stop it, by the way. In fact I found police activity to be less than credible throughout.On a personal level, as an aged stay-at-home Brit who finally visited the USA last year, it was pleasing to see places in New York, Detroit and San Francisco which I had seen while I was there (is Detroit really on the way from New York to San Francisco by road when you're in a hurry?).",Need for Speed
10,morrison-dylan-fan,"""I feel the need for speed.""",4,9 April 2015,"Talking to a friend about the new Fast & Furious flick on his Facebook wall,a mutual friend made a comment about how she preferred the Need For Speed movie to the latest Furious film.With having enjoyed playing the Need For Speed game years ago,I felt that it was time to get up to speed with its film adaptation.The plot:Struggling to pay the mortgage on his garage business, mechanics Tobey Marshall & ""Little Pete"" Coleman decide to accept Dino Brewster offer of going up against him in a street race,with Brewster saying that if either of them beat him,he will give them each a big cash reward.Teaming up on the race,Marshall gets close to reaching the finish line,until Brewster suddenly slams into Coleman's car,and kills him.Leaving Marshall in the dust,Coleman hides his involvement in the killing and gets all the blame put on Marshall,which leads to him being sent to jail for 2 years.2 Years later:Finally getting out of jail,Marshall sets his eyes on avenging Coleman's death.Learning that Brewster is to take part in a major street race tournament,Marshall soon begins to rediscover his need for speed.View on the film:Taking the video game off the consoles and on to the big screen,director Scott Waugh and cinematographer Shane Hurlbut do very well at capturing the spirit of the game franchise in the racing scenes,with Waugh using neon street lights to give the film a stylish,metallic appearance.Whilst the racing scenes are pretty well filmed,the screenplay by George and John Gatins turn the movie into a real drag race,due to all of the characters being kept in a personality-free middle of the road.Following their route,Waugh keeps the chase for revenge on a flat road,with no sense of any sharp turns or head-on collisions being allowed to occur,in a film that runs out of fuel far too soon.",Need for Speed
11,anaconda-40658,Need for Speed or Anything That Will Erase Its Memory.,3,22 May 2015,"Need for Speed (2014): Dir: Scott Waugh / Cast: Aaron Paul, Dominic Cooper, Imogen Poots, Michael Keaton, Harrison Gilbertson: No, this isn't a film about drugs although one might desire the need to vanquish the memory of this car wreck immediately after viewing. The title references the need to triumph over grief as drag racer Tobey Marshall is imprisoned for two years when rival driver Dino Brewster leaves the scene when an accident he caused results in the death of his girlfriend's brother. Marshall vows revenge but will do so within a highly publicized drag race that seems to do nothing more than presents great unbelievable stunts and a total disregard for anyone else on the road. Director Scott Waugh shoots some spectacular stunts including one over the grand canyon that involves a car and a helicopter. Unfortunately the screenplay is just one excuse for reckless driving and total ignorance to the safety of others. Aaron Paul is famous for his work on the TV hit Braking Bad. He is a decent actor but sidelined by the stunts here. Dominic Cooper has the thankless role of Dino whose villainous action are almost laughable especially in over the top antics to rule Marshall out of the race. Imogen Poots as Marshall's female sidekick is constantly annoying. Michael Keaton plays a bizarre pod cast personality who has too much time on his hands. Harrison Gilbertson plays the idiot younger brother who winds up dead because he was part of illegal driving. The stunts and effects are done well but the screenplay is clichéd and characters flat. The audience should desire a need for speed to exit the theatre undetected. Score: 3 / 10",Need for Speed
12,phd_travel,Realistic racing sequences but lame story,3,20 July 2014,"F&F movies were running out of story with all the silly crime and fighting and overblown special effect type car chases so this movie has one thing going for it getting back to pure and simple car racing with some good scenery along the way. The Northern California race is spectacular and exciting enough and looks realistic - not obviously stunt man driven or special effect enhanced. Read that the actors had to learn how to drive racing style for their parts so kudos to them. But that's about all that is good about this movie.The story is lame and badly written. The revenge thing is so contrived and you really don't feel for any of the characters. The romance is completely sizzle free. As far as the British cast is concerned Imogen Poots is a little out of place and the evil character played by Dominic Cooper seems a bit nasty for no good reason. Dakota Johnson has a insipid supporting role - wonder how she will do in 50 Shades? Aaron Paul is a terrific actor and is just priceless on ""Breaking Bad"" but he isn't right for this role. He doesn't have the cool edge and the rakish looks required for this character. And the intense stare he gives now and then simply looks daft. Watch it if you like to see this kind of racing but be warned the story is bad.",Need for Speed
13,trashgang,only for the cars,7,14 August 2014,"My best friend told me to watch this flick because it's full of fast cars especially the Ford Mustang. I admit, it's a nice car and the last minute it's just a commercial for the new Mustang model. But hey, we are watching a movie so it's the story line that must be interesting. And it's here were this flick fails a bit. The story itself is not that strong and clocking in over 90 minutes it doesn't attract you all the time. There's a bit of a love story involved but for me it just didn't work. What did work was the way the car chases were filmed. That's the strenght of this flick. The cars. If you do love fast expensive cars then this is a must see but you have to wait until the end to see them. But even for the muscle car freaks there's much to see like a Ford Gran Torino and a Chevy SS (like in the Fast And Furious series) amongst others. There's much said about this flick due being based on the Need For Speed game. For me the most boring parts were the love story and the commentary given by the Monarch (Michael Keaton). Aaron Paul is of course for many the main reason to watch this as he is becoming the next big thing after his role in Breaking Bad (Jeese Pinkman). He did fine here but somehow I found him a bit miscasted. He's got that 'bad' face, remember The Last House On The Left (2009).Still, it's worth watching if you like the cars but if you want real action and a good storyline then you should better go watch the Fast And Furious franchise.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",Need for Speed
14,KineticSeoul,"For a movie based on a video game, it ain't that bad.",6,13 July 2014,"If this movie wasn't so darn cheesy in certain areas, it would actually be a pretty good movie based on a video game franchise. However most of the viewers will probably get what they want out of this movie. With a super ridiculous and yet passable plot. And some cool car races with luxury cars and stunts. It isn't edge of your seat awesome, but it does it's job. I thought it would have been cool if it played more on the underground street racing. Especially since ""Need for Speed: Underground"" is one of my favorite in this franchise. Maybe because it has been done before in ""The Fast and the Furious"". It could have incorporated the structure and environment of the video games more. It even has couple of decent chase scenes to go with it though. On the negative side, it does not hold much emotion or incentive when it comes to the story connecting with the car scenes. Except maybe one, which is the scene where the protagonist let's his partner sit on his lap so she could take the wheel. The direction is just too darn conventional, but it does give what the audiences want from a ""Need for Speed"" for the most part...Which is the races and a passable story that connects it (even if the jokes in between is pretty bad). I could however see that they actually put in some effort to make a decent movie based on a video game. However the trailer is actually better than the movie itself. To sum it up, it's a popcorn flick that is worth one watch at most.6/10",Need for Speed
15,Hellmant,I don't have much of an interest in cars; still I enjoyed the movie.,7,10 April 2014,"'NEED FOR SPEED': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Another car chase/race movie that's also a video game adaptation! This one is loosely based on the 'Need for Speed' game series (specifically 'Need for Speed: The Run' and 'Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit'). It stars Aaron Paul as a street racer, who was just released from prison, out to avenge his friend's death (which was caused by a rival racer). The movie was directed by Scott Waugh, who also directed the 2012 war film 'ACT OF VALOR' (and there's even a shot of the DVD in this movie). It was written by George and John Gatins (John has also written or co-written such hit films as 'FLIGHT' and 'REAL STEEL'). I found the movie to be flawed but more entertaining than a lot of car and video game flicks.Paul plays Tobey Marshall, an ex-race car driver who now owns a garage (in New York) where he and his four best friends fix up performance cars. Business is slow though and Tobey and his crew must also street race at night (to make enough money to get by). While times are especially rough Tobey also takes a job from a rival racer, named Dino Brewster (Dominic Cooper), to finish building a rare Ford Shelby Mustang (that they sell for $2.7 million). Tobey and Dino then make a racing bet, for the other's share of the profits, in which Tobey's friend Pete (Harrison Gilbertson) also competes. Pete is killed during the race when Dino taps his car (trying to get by). Dino then flees the scene and creates an alibi; letting Tobey take all the blame for his friend's death (and go to prison for two years). When Tobey is released he vows revenge, which includes a plan of competing in an underground cross-country race called the De Leon. The movie also costars Imogen Poots, Rami Malek, Ramón Rodríguez, Scott Mescudi and Michael Keaton.The film was a bomb domestically (making just over $40 million) but a hit worldwide (grossing nearly $185 million, so far). It cost $66 million to make and it shows; the effects are great (it was also released in 3D) and the race scenes are spectacular. I think any automobile enthusiast should be thrilled with it. I'm not sure how faithful the flick is to the video games it's based on but I don't think that probably really matters (to most fans). None of the performances are that good, except for maybe Keaton (who has some bad lines but also some great delivery). I thought it was pretty fun overall (especially compared to others in it's genre). My big problem with movies like this is they glamorize reckless driving though; they make heroes out of characters that jeopardize many other lives in order to fulfill their 'need for speed'. It's the equivalent of a movie that makes drunk drivers heroes (on a moral level). I also don't have much of an interest in cars; still I enjoyed the movie though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-G3-O3wYgs",Need for Speed
16,Buddy-51,Paul deserves better,4,21 September 2014,"A high-octane action flick on the order of the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise, ""Need for Speed"" features the less-than-impressive first big-screen headliner role for Aaron Paul, the brilliant young star of TV's ""Breaking Bad."" In it, he portrays Tobey Marshall, an unassuming mechanic by day and by night a street racer whose recently deceased dad was not only the owner of the body shop that Tobey is now trying to rescue from the old man's years of mismanagement but a legend among the die-hard racing crowd. Daddy issues much? Before he knows it, Tobey is wrongly convicted of the death of his best friend in a fiery car crash and, when he's finally paroled, dedicates his life to exacting revenge on the actual culprit, a snooty rival from Tobey's past. And what better or more fitting way than by besting said villain in an illegal cross-country race sponsored by an underground radio announcer played by Michael Keaton?The plot, such as it is, doesn't require much more in the way of elaboration, other than to say that it's basically just an excuse for a bunch of testosterone-fueled, speed-busting outlaws to careen through the city streets and around the countryside in their fantastically expensive race cars with zero regard for the lives and safety of themselves or anyone else around them. This cavalier attitude is supposed to make the characters somehow cool and charming when what they really are is obnoxious and appalling. And while we're asked to weep when one of their own number gets inevitably killed in an ""accident,"" that same courtesy isn't extended to any of the innocent motorists or law enforcement officials who might get taken out during their high-stakes ""playtime."" They're all just ""collateral damage,"" I suppose.One understands Paul's need for a little R&R in the acting department after the intense rigors required by five seasons of ""Breaking Bad."" Still, one hopes that he'll soon get back to doing what he does best now that he's gotten this little career detour into commercial movie-making out of his system.Director Scott Waugh pumps up the action scenes efficiently, but he's had far less success with the quieter expository moments. No surprise, given that the movie is based on a video game of the same name.The supporting cast includes Dominic Cooper, Imogen Poots, Ramon Rodriguez (""Gang-Related""), Rami Malek and the aforementioned Keaton, but, like Paul, they too play second fiddle to the cars, chase scenes and stunt work. And that, I guess, is as it should be when it comes to a movie with a title like ""Need for Speed.""",Need for Speed
17,FeastMode,my notes,3,24 June 2019,The cars were awesome. the race scenes were awesome. everything else was horrible. the dialogue was so bad. acting so bad. I hated all the actors except Aaron Paul who was ok (1 viewing),Need for Speed
18,Robert_duder,I see their attempt but haven't we been here before?,5,14 August 2014,"Probably the biggest error on the part of the film makers for Need for Speed was that this entire concept has been done to great success. Need For Speed is literally The Fast and The Furious...again. I do give them kudos for seemingly trying to make this slightly more emotional and in depth with a stronger story and attachment to the main character but for whatever reason it simply doesn't work. There isn't anything here that we have not seen before. The fact that it is based on a video game has no bearing in this case because it has nothing to do with the video game. I think I see a few scenes where they tried to pay homage to the original source material but its unnecessary because this is really just a film about fast cars and racing. It is one of those films that on the surface doesn't seem to be so bad and I even assumed with the success of The Fast and The Furious series and red blooded males everywhere that this would do well but it is just missing something...some magic little quality that makes it truly entertaining. The lack of originality plays a big part of that.I am, like millions of other people, love Aaron Paul from Breaking Bad. I do think he's a great actor and he actually shows a lot of passion in this role. I think he puts a lot of honest effort into this role that gives back very little. Its also a far stretch from Jesse Pinkman which is a good move for him. Imogen Poots is okay in her role. She is definitely cute and her and Paul have okay chemistry. Her biggest problem is her character is terribly written. She jumps from being ""hot car girl"" to being ""whiny needy high maintenance girl."" I don't think you can be the girly girl and the guy's girl all at the same time (in movies anyways.) It doesn't work for her. The entire supporting cast is okay at best. You can't get anymore excruciatingly typical and predictable as Scott Mescudi's character. Same could be said for Rami Malek, Ramon Rodriguez and Harrison Gilbertson. All of them are integral to the story but left very underdeveloped so that you don't become attached to any of them and that's unfortunate. Need For Speed is also lacking a significant villain or decent rivalry. The script lays the ground work for an ""epic"" rivalry but there is no chemistry there with the two leads and it never goes anywhere leaving you unfulfilled. Michael Keaton (who I adore) is completely wasted and I still don't understand his purpose as some sort of race caller or web-host of some kind. His character makes no sense and I'm not even sure why he did it.Despite having some success with Act of Valor, director Scott Waugh lacks the experience of a director and instead uses his experience as a stunt man to create flash with zero substance. Flash doesn't go far unless its really brilliant and has a story to back in. Even Michael Bay knows that for the most part. Waugh is not the right man to bring this story together and it essentially killed this potential franchise. Though given how typical it is, it probably never would have taken off. Car lovers might get a kick out of it but outside of that its brainless and barely entertaining. Outside of a few scenes and Aaron Paul, its a complete write off. 5/10",Need for Speed
19,bowmanblue,What Jessie Pinkman did next...,7,25 July 2014,"The last time most people saw Aaron Paul was when he was victoriously driving out of a compound filled with dead white supremacists. Of course if you haven't seen the smash TV series 'Breaking Bad' that will probably mean nothing to you (but I do recommend you watch it!). However, if, like many, you enjoyed the series where Aaron Paul was an integral part, you may realise that him starring in 'Need For Speed' isn't that greater step in his acting career.He basically plays the same sort of character with a few minor differences. This time he races fast cars, but was deliberately framed for the death of a teammate during a race and sent to jail for five seconds (okay, two years, but his sentence was severely glossed over in film-making terms!). Now he's out and racing across America for big money stakes (and trying to clear his name while he's at it).A lot of people are liking Need for Speed with the 'Fast and the Furious' franchise. It has similarities – mainly the car racing and high speed stunts in case you hadn't already worked that out! But I think there's room for both, as Need For Speed seems to manage to squeeze enough originality into the genre.I hear it's even based on a computer game. I haven't played the game, but I'm guessing this movie adaptation is a damn sight better than Streetfighter or Super Mario Bros! If you're a fan of the Fast and the Furious-type movies and/or Aaron Paul in general, you should enjoy this. Imogen Poots is the obligatory love interest and she gets better as the film goes on. At first she seems a bit like a fish out of water (or a posh British girl trying to pass herself off as an American streets racer), but, once she drops the ridiculous sunglasses, she settles into her role a little more.Don't dwell on some of the slight plot holes (like how Aaron Paul's best friend seems to be able to conjure up a new aircraft to get him out of danger every time), just enjoy the high-octane jousts on the road with a bag of popcorn.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Need for Speed
20,MLDinTN,"should have been called ""Copy Cat""",5,5 April 2015,"This movie was clearly made because of the success of the Fast and Furious franchise. And movies that just to be like other ones usually aren't too good, as case in point.Tobey Marshall is a small time street racer. He and his friend, Pete, make a bet with Dino, whomever wins, gets the whole profit of 2 million dollar car they sold. But, just as Tobey is about to win something goes wrong, and the next thing he knows, he's in jail and Dino gets away.Once Tobey gets out, he encounters the car buyer, Julia, and they are off to California to enter a race in which the winner gets to keep all the cars, which total millions. And it takes a long time before the film ever gets to the big race. I guess the whole car getting lifted by a helicopter was probably the best part.Some things just didn't make sense. Why did Tobey do all the illegal driving when heading off to California? If he would have driven normally, the cops wouldn't have been after him. And for the big race, what is the point in winning all the cars, if all of them are totaled except one. Also, why did they have the finish line in a place where the winner is going to get caught.

Seriously, if you start at that mark you will completely miss (a) the idiotic ""male bonding"" banter between Aaron Paul (the star) and his buddies in the opening garage scenes; the not-at-all-exciting-because-it-is-filmed-in-the-dark opening race which is almost gratuitously inserted at the front end in order to (try to) get the adrenalin pumping; and, best of all, you will miss the outrageously maudlin and predictable ""death scene"" where the ""dumb innocent"" is sacrificed specifically so the script writer can establish once and for all that the evil protagonist is truly rotten to the core, and a murderer, and only a ""race"" between him and the hero (Paul) can right the wrongs.Folks, this is a B movie with very high aspirations and IF YOU TAKE MY ADVICE AND START IT AS INDICATED, it is actually a lot of fun. There are ""homages"" to VANISHING POINT and BULLET and other famous (infamous?) car flicks buried deep in the script, and, by and large, they contribute to the overall merriment.

Lots of camera shots from adjacent camera car of racing car wheels. About as creative as corn flakes. 3. Lots of car exhaust rumbles but for some reason when the camera is mounted on the dash or hood looking inward the car doesn't vibrate a single iota. Lack of attention to detail was the norm and a good indicator of poor quality. 4. Very rote, stereotypic plot of poor car shop mechanic vs. nasty rich and successful ex-townsman racer. Toss in the predictable ex-female love interest and an enticing but totally unbelievable new female hook for the male under 25s and it's an all formula script. 5. Poor car shop mechanic has a posse mix of all demographics tossed in to hook in more viewers but leaves believability further behind. 6. Acting and dialogue were Saturday cartoon level age appropriate. Fake animosity between poor car mechanic and rich racer - laughable and obviously contrived. 7. Couple of car crashes no different than hundreds of other movies; even those car chases were secondary or even tertiary to the storyline. 8. Writing in scenes where people are racing throughs streets just for sport and in areas where, lets say, a child steps in front and death is an instant away is irresponsibly bankrupt writing just so people can make a few bucks off of a movie.

26,851222,Everything you have already seen wrapped in a nice looking movie,7,5 August 2014,"Greetings from Lithuania. ""Need for Speed"" (2014) desperately tries to become the new ""Fast & Furiuos"" type flick, but so far it doesn't have the guts. The main problems come from a highly predictable plot, and i mean highly - if you have ever seen flick about illegal races and hero drivers, than you have seen ""Need for Speed"" - everything in here is a rip off from other movies. It's not bad although, actually a kinda enjoyable flick if you can ignore the fact that 15 minutes into the movie when all characters will be established, you will be 100% sure who is bad, who is good and who will fall in love with whom eventually, ye, it's that ""old fashion rip off""! What is good in this film, it's a races them self - almost all done by stunts (or at least it looks that way), you can clearly understand who is where and what is happening, and it's not overdone (aka. ""Fast 5,6"" flying super-automobiles), everything looks real - that's the strong point of the flick.Overall, this is enjoyable flick, with nothing new or original, but still it's a nice escapism.",Need for Speed
27,Reno-Rangan,No playing. This time we sit and watch.,8,29 July 2014,"If Marvel turns their comic books into the movies and WWE with their men then why not EA. It was co-produced by EA with the other leading production houses. Nice move for the first step and well done overall. I am not into the computer games, but I was playing when I was young and 'NFS Most Wanted' is one of my favorites. No need to say any further that I was looking for this movie.I thought the story will be borrowed straight from the game and move a level after another to the peak till the end commence. But what I saw was only the 5%, I mean only the introduction with lots of drama than what the title symbolizes. Because it is a business, a smart move by the production house. The idea is to split everything into at least for 4 to 5 movies in the series. Like what the final part of the Harry Potter's 'The Deathly Hallows' and The Twilight's 'Breaking Dawn' did. They are going to do it here from the very beginning, so don't expect like the Himalayas, especially if you are NFS MW freak.Tobey Marshall, a custom car maker who is behind the loan takes up the street race challenge to make few bucks quick. But the race ends in a tragedy and locked behind the bars for someone's fault. After out of the prison he's raged to avenge. Now he needs a car, the faster one, so the story proceeds with his new adventures which involves cops pursuing him. But he set his mind that to make the real offender to pay for his crime. This road movie, which commence in New York and ends in San Francisco was told grandly.''The racers should race, cops should eat donuts.''No offense, but I did not like the lead guy, except him the rest were great. It is not fair to find defect in him to blame, actually he was good, but I expected someone good looking than him or existing young popular star. If you see in other franchises in the middle of the movie series they replacing with industry's giant and I won't surprise if that happens in the future for this. In the game we are the protagonists and to see him in our position I kind of find uncomfortable. Maybe it could have happened same to me if the other guys were in his place. So it is not the lead guy, but he's not anywhere near to me is the issue. Lol.Overall movie is not one breathtaking entertainment. I liked the pieces of the movie, the scenes. There are a few great scenes that give excitement and pleasure. Commonly we see a computer hacker who hangs out with the movie's protagonist to assist in his expertise area. The same guy here was excellent who came up with extraordinary ideas, but not satisfied with what happens to him at the end. I could not believe this young and not-so-popular cast done the wonderful job. I don't know why I liked Imogen Poots a lot who even not had best shot from the movie, hopefully in a sequel she going to expose her physical strength for the stunts.The first movie in a movie series is always very important & I don't know why they didn't go to complete the action-adventure pack with sufficient pace. To me the story was not pleased enough, but screen presentation with the game like the angle of the camera panning and all promised me to stick with it. There were no locations that are taken from the game except in one scene where the car jumps over the road. If you have played the game will know it what I am saying. The digital 3D was okay. What I learnt from this format is that only graphical movies either animated or live action are awesome to watch. The normal regular live shot movies are totally useless in digital 3D. In this movie the best effects came in those stunt sequences and rest were plain. So digital 3D is not that worth. The car movie that does not look like a where it belongs to. A decent one, hopefully the second movie could be what I am expecting. Better it should come up with something great or the franchise is going to fall in the pit. This movie is exclusively for youngsters & I see no reason for others to take interest on it.7.5/10",Need for Speed

29,eddie_baggins,Overblown and a whole lot of fun,6,19 November 2014,"Perhaps signalling the true dark times of Hollywood movie making were remakes, reimagining's and licensing run wild, Need for Speed produced in part with EA and based off there long running racing themed game series is sure fire example of how low some studios have sunken to in search of big budget material and potential franchises able to reap the money of teenagers pockets for years to come. While this is true and in ways slightly depressing, something surprising happens with Need for Speed, for not only is it a decent video game adaptation but it's a seriously enjoyable movie despite all its many varied and glaring flaws.Not to be taken seriously in any way shape or form, Need for Speed is guilty pleasure movie making at its most fun, it's most entertaining and at times hand clapping stupid thanks to a set of unbelievable circumstances and more crazy driving shenanigans than you can poke a Fast and Furious box set at. Handling proceedings with some type of Paul W.S Anderson like glee for ridiculousness is director Scott Waugh who seemingly set out to burn as much rubber and testosterone as humanly possible in a film that features one of the most un-plausible scenarios this side of a Damon Lindelof script but none of that really matters when the action is so self-aware and enjoyable. Not even some horrible acting turns can dampen the silly fun times.Everyone's favourite chemistry assistant Jesse Pinkman aka Aaron Paul is given his first real chance to make a mark as a film lead here as driver extraordinaire Tobey Marshall and by George does he make a fist of it all. Paul doesn't exude a single ounce of the charisma that made his Breaking Bad turn such a roaring success, filling his turn here with concerned eyebrow raising moments, gruff mumbling undertones and some hooky serious intent stares in a performance that will not likely result in studio execs clambering for his services. All actors in the piece are overshadowed by their 4 wheel compatriots with a crazy hyperactive turn by son to be Birdman Michael Keaten as shock jock racing figure Monarch a real highlight/lowlight of this adrenaline fuelled ride.Recommending Need for Speed would be like recommending to someone that they should drink Coke every day, it might taste good but it certainly isn't good for them. Need For Speed has no illusions of what it is even if it may have wanted to be some type of rival to the Furious series. With enough entertaining car related sequences (that scarily lack a concern for the average day pedestrian), a one liner filled b grade script and the curiosity factor of seeing Paul try and lead a big budget venture one thing is for sure, Need for Speed is never not enjoyable (even though it's about 40 minutes to long) when taken in the right context.

30,leonblackwood,Full of adrenalin and intensity! 6/10,6,20 July 2014,"Review: This is a proper popcorn movie with loads of car racing and intense drama all the way through. Personally, I found the movie to be a bit long winded and unrealistic but just like the Fast & Furious franchise, it's all about the adrenalin which keeps the movie interesting. This movie is totally based on revenge after the main character, Aaron Paul, has been framed for a murder and sent to prison for 2 years. I did find it a bit corny but the racing is pretty impressive. It could have done with a few more stars but I think the director deliberately made the cars the main characters because they all have there own personalities. Basically, the movie is what it says on the tin so if your not a car junkie, you will get bored after a while. Watchable!Round-Up: This was a good choice of movie for Aaron Paul to star in after his role in Breaking Bad because it doesn't totally rely on his acting ability. I do find his acting style a bit limited so this action packed movie was a food way to go in his career. Dominic Cooper has starred in a wide range of films with some big names. From Captain America to Mamma Mia, I doubt that this movie will do his career any harm. He doesn't really play the lead that often but he does seem to get some great cameos roles. One of the things that impressed me about this movie is that they didn't use a lot of CGI. It all seems like it's really been filmed on the road, which must have been hard because some of the stunts were really over the top. Anyway, it's worth a watch just to see the impressive motor vehicles and to see Michael Keaton on form.Budget: $66million Worldwide Gross: $203millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there underground car racing movies about a man seeking for revenge by winning an important race which could change his life. 6/10",Need for Speed

Have you longed to see a movie starring One Direction look-alikes who drive real fast? Do you wish car commercials were over two hours long? Then have we got a movie for you! Otherwise, Need for Speed will leave you dumbfounded at its dullness. The idea of making a movie out of a racing video game is bad enough; add-in flat characters, ridiculous dialogue and complete lack of excitement and what's left is worse than imagined. This is essentially a Fast and Furious knock-off, but one would imagine they would bring something new to the table. But, noit's completely formulaic. No surprise or intrigues exist at all. In fact, other than a couple of okay crash scenes and racing moments, tension and excitement are entirely absent. I longed for the ""thrill"" of the go-kart derby race in Little Rascals to replace the humdrum of the driving scenes here. Talent is just wasted everywhere. Poots (That Awkward Moment) and Keaton (RoboCop) are each 0 for 2 on movies this year, and Aaron Paul deserves a much better vehicle. He's not terrible, but his vulnerable, round-faced, boyish charm can only go so far. Worst of all is the morality of this film. The ""good guys"" are doing atrocious things. They're reckless, selfish, unlikable, pompous idiots, and we are supposed to root for them. All of this goes to show it really doesn't matter how ""cool"" or ""pretty"" you think you're movie is.

Aaron plays just such a fast-car driver that gets into trouble by being framed for a crime he did not commit by a rival, Dominic. When a secretive fast-car race pops up, run by a secretive Michael, Aaron decides to have his revenge on Dominic by beating him in the race. The only problem is that Aaron needs a car, which Imogen helps to provide in the form of a Shelby Mustang, and the race is clear across the country-Aaron is in New York and the race is in San Francisco. Dominic decides to put a bounty on Aaron-for some reason, he does not want to actually race him-and the fun begins, with both bounty hunters and the police after Aaron. As you can probably tell, there is not much new here, as far as plot, but that isn't why you go to see these types of movies, is it? You go for the stunts and the fast driving and in that department, they deliver the goods. In the stunts and chases, they used real cars-not CGI-to great effect and Aaron did a lot of his own driving. There is a 3D version, which is how I saw it, and it looked good, but it would be fine in regular 2D. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence-mostly crash scenes-language, and, believe it or not, nudity-there is one scene where an actor strips down to the buff but you can not see a frontal view of their private areas- and has a running time of 2 hours & 10 minutes.

35,3xHCCH,So Much Better Than The F&F Clone I Expected,8,13 March 2014,"The story of ""Need for Speed"" begins in the small town of Mt. Kisco in New York state. Tobey Marshall ran a car detailing joint he inherited from his dad. An old rival, Dino Brewster, frames Tobey for causing a deadly car accident. After serving his jail sentence, Tobey sought revenge and vindication via one big final race where the two main characters meet to settle their differences. I am have not seen any episode of the acclaimed TV series ""Breaking Bad"" so I was not familiar who lead actor Aaron Paul was. As Tobey, Paul was able to convince us of his driving prowess, as well as effectively convey the deep emotional motivations. I had only known of the quirky Imogen Poots earlier this year in ""That Awkward Moment."" She is in a much bigger role here as sassy Julia, the British car broker who got to be Toby's cross-country driving partner. She is delightful, funny and awkward in a cute way.As the bad guy Dino, Dominic Cooper has matured since we first saw him as the groom-to-be in ""Mamma Mia"". Playing Tobey's crew are more up and coming young actors: Scott Mescudi (a.k.a. Kid Cudi the rapper) as Benny the wacky pilot; Rami Malek as Finn (his random naked comic sequence is still a head-scratcher), and Harrison Gilbertson as Little Pete (the emotional core of the film). The one senior star in the cast is Michael Keaton who played Monarch the online-based organizer of illegal drag races. His animated play-by-play annotation of the racing adds to the excitement and drama.Of course, the main stars are actually the amazing cars. Tobey drove from New York to California in a Custom 2014 Ford Mustang GT500. In the start of the film we witness a drag race with classic cars like the 1969 Ford Torino GT, 1967 Pontiac GTO, among others. In the climactic big race, we see intense super-cars with speeds over 200kph like the beautiful Koenigsegg Agera R, Lamborghini Sesto Elemento, GTA Spano, McLaren P1, Bugatti Veyron Super Sport and others. At the very end of the film, we even get to see a preview of a 2015 Ford Mustang.The live (not CG) car racing and chase scenes were very excitingly edited together -- a true adrenaline rush. There is one particular car stunt scene called the ""Grasshopper"" in a Detroit highway that was outstandingly exhilarating. We will be treated to various scenic American landscapes along the way as they drive cross-country. The Grand Canyon scenes were particularly spectacular. At first I did not plan to watch ""Need for Speed"" because the trailer made it look like an exact clone of ""The Fast and the Furious"" films. After I watched it, I realize that it is not. This is an excellent car movie in its own right! 8/10.",Need for Speed

37,Seraphion,It's a great movie indeed,8,15 March 2014,"A lot is expected from this move since it is based on one of the most popular racing games franchise.Like all other ""adaptations"" based movies, I'll be doing this review in a comparative way to the base itself, on this case to the games of Need for Speed franchise. Also since I am also a fan of Need for Speed games, this will be quite a lengthy review compared to others I've done before. :D LOLThis is indeed a bold move for a debut feature film based on a franchise, shown by this movie bearing the logo of the games publisher Electronic Arts, and also by its sheer 2 hours duration.The story is about Tobey, a race driver who takes the blame for a death of one his racing friend. After released from jail on parole he borrows an ultimate car he helped modified and drive across the country to participate in a big race. After all the hurdles he eventually make it to the race.Most of Need for Speed games, even since the PlayStation (PSX) era, has a good enough story to follow. Until recently, in those stories the player is given a choice to start their race ""career"" with a choice of cars, usually of middle class Japanese or European imports. American muscle cars are relatively recently being introduced as starter cars since ""Need for Speed Blacklist"". But in this movie, it was all, but one, muscle cars on the first race, a bit strange for veteran Need for Speed gamers.From the first race scene, the idea of the catch by adding the danger factor of the train is just great. Also the track composition of alleyways and non-road ways are just reminiscent of the games. The Mustang's HUD on the track scene also reminiscent of the games.The second race scenes start to introduce the real mayhem of the Need for Speed games to the viewers. Sudden brakes and lane changes and swerving, counter-flow driving, back draft slipstreams, crashes, most importantly the ""pursuitbreaker"" moments, all while racing million dollar priced exotic sports cars are the things that make a Need for Speed game great. Those are present on this race scene. In this second race scene there is also the nice addition of the common strategy players use to beat AIs by hitting their tails making them fishtailing. And they took a great effort by trashing a Koenigsegg Agera R!! LOLThe city scene is just, again, reminiscent in a very good way to the more recent Need for Speed games, which often take the setting of the race on suburbs. The police hot pursuit is a perfect depiction of what the gamers do in-game. The addition of ""grasshopper"" is a nice effort of coining a term for air time in the race or pursuit. SO does the addition of ""hot fueling"". Up to this point, the movie does well live up to its title as a Need for Speed.Dramatization of the whole Need for Speed theme by adding emotions into the story and screenplay really enrich the experience of the movie. It's a good thing that there is comic relief, as when Tobey is in the gas station and the dog startled him, AND when Julia gets out of the restroom and spots the police and ducks. The emotion play also follows right after, which is when Tobey asks Julia to switch to drive.The final race is great. Six supercars, the real supercars in the real world that tops the rest in terms of speed and price, race in a winner takes all race. The race is soon joined by police involving rolling blocks, roadblocks, ""rhino"" units, and air units, just as in the games.The action is just off the hook. The ideas are very creative. For instance, we may have seen cars being winched by helicopters. But using it to escape a chase? I first see it in this movie.One thing strange about this movie, though. Not once I see any of the race drivers engage any Nitrous Oxide system speed boost, which is a common modification addition in race-purpose sports cars. It is strange because that kind of system is typical in racing themed movies or games. It makes the race drivers to be perceived as using just stock cars, even though they are really expensive sports cars.The final twist is just great to build up a character worth a long lasting franchise.Bottom line, it is a GREAT movie which gets a definitive recommendation from to go and see. an 8 out of 10 score is for this one.

40,moviexclusive,"Running on nothing more than fumes, this interminably long road trip of a racing flick plays like a sluggish live-action 'Cars' than a new 'Fast and Furious' franchise",3,8 March 2014,"How do you turn a racing game into a movie? Well we guess the 'Fast and Furious' franchise offers a ready template, but anyone hoping for this video game adaptation to deliver the same kind of high-octane thrills will be sorely disappointed. And that's because instead of using that franchise as the most obvious reference point, the filmmakers have instead taken heed from Disney/ Pixar's 'Cars' and we kid you not, this resembles a live-action version of the animated film and comes off all the worse off for it.Offering up as straightforward a story as you can get, first-time feature film writer George Gatins sets up a personal vendetta between local street racer Tobey Marshall and competitive racer Dino Brewster which forms the basis of the entire movie. High-school rivals whose fates have since diverged, the slicker California-based Dino challenges the less urbane Tobey to a race around their small town of Mt. Kisco, NY, in order to prove which among them is the better racer. Just because Dino happens to be engaged to Tobey's ex-flame Anita (Dakota Johnson), her brother Pete (Harrison Gilbertson), who also happens to be Tobey's good buddy, joins in the race as well.Playing a one-two tag team, Tobey and Pete force Dino into pole position, which provokes the latter to ram Pete's vehicle from the back, causing it to spin, crash and catch fire spectacularly. Whereas Dino immediately flees the scene and finds an alibi, Tobey spends the next two years in jail for vehicular manslaughter. Upon his release on parole, Tobey immediately assembles his old crew to drive 45 hours across America to participate in an illegal race in California known as the DeLeon in order to exact vengeance and clear his name in the process.Clocking in at an interminable 131 minutes, too much time is spent following Tobey and his buddies - Benny (Scott Mescudi), Joe (Ramon Rodriguez) and Finn (Rami Malek) - as they provide both ground and air support for Tobey's cross-country drive in a legendary Mustang that Carroll Shelby himself was purportedly building before he passed away. Amongst Tobey's crew, the most interesting of the lot is unquestionably Benny, who turns up in everything from a small prop plane to a news chopper to a military cargo chopper to provide air recon and eventually airlift to Tobey's Mustang.Despite the addition of Brit actress' Imogen Poots as Tobey's wing 'woman' and obligatory romantic interest, there is little that Tobey and his crew can do to sustain your interest on the way to the expected finale. Pardon our bluntness, but Benny just isn't a very humorous 'black man' (think Tyrese Gibson in 'Transformers' or Ludicrous in 'Fast and Furious') no matter Gatins' attempt at milking that stereotype for all that it is worth. Joe and Finn hardly get much attention; the most you'll remember of the former is that he's a pretty skilled high-tech mechanic and of the latter that he strips completely naked somewhere during the movie to show that he's had enough of his corporate cubicle job.In the absence of engaging moments of camaraderie, director Scott Waugh - his sophomore film since making his debut in the Navy SEALS drama 'Act of Valor' - tries to sustain the momentum by staging a fair number of high-speed car chases as Tobey tries to evade getting caught by the interstate police for violating the rules of his parole while getting noticed by the mysterious 'Monarch' (a terribly under-utilised Michael Keaton who spends all the time in the movie behind a console playing a video podcast radio show host) in order to get invited to the DeLeon.Waugh's insistence at using real cars for each and every one of the stunts pays off to a certain extent - there's often no doubt you're seeing it for real on screen - but there is just something oddly disengaging about the manner in which the shots are edited together to form a coherent whole. Waugh's cinematographer Shane Hurlbut finds a variety of ways of putting the audience right into the point of view of the driver (in the spirit of the first-person perspective of the video game), and to give credit where it is due, there are a number of good heart-stopping Vertigo shots; but on the overall, none of the car chases are choreographed with the same imagination as you would expect from a Hollywood racing flick, which is OK only if you're expecting nothing more than reality-show type stunts.In fact, the entire movie plays like a car stuck in second gear all the way through, incapable of revving up from a persistently sluggish pace even when it's close to the finishing line. The climax is nothing to shout for, even though it does total a number of expensive luxury cars that you'd wish the filmmakers had simply let you own instead. Waugh's heavy-handed tendencies with the more melodramatic scenes are also not what 'Breaking Bad' star Aaron Paul and his entourage manage to overcome; rather, Paul seems utterly out of his league playing the leading man here, coming off soft, ineffectual and thoroughly lacking in any sort of screen charisma.Every which way you look, this movie adaptation of the popular video game series of the same name just doesn't cut it. The plotting is almost inexistent; the dialogue is awkward, stilted and often cringe-worthy; and the racing scenes barely raise a pulse for the modern-day viewer greased on them 'Fast and Furious' flicks. It would certainly have been better if Waugh had tried to launch a new 'Fast and Furious' franchise, rather than a live-action 'Cars' movie that leads its viewer along a road trip down half of America. True to its title, it demonstrates a desperate 'need for speed', which pretty much explains why it goes on and on (and on) for more than two hours.",Need for Speed
41,quincytheodore,"With idiotic story, poor attempt on comedy and bad acting, Need for Speed crashes, hopefully terribly enough so there won't be a sequel.",3,16 March 2014,"As one knows, acquiring the name of a driving game franchise immediately legitimizes a movie adaptation, giving unique character needed to differentiate it from Fast and Furious. Regardless of how thin plot from any Need for Speed games are, the movie manages to trip itself with overly inconceivably ridiculous story and actually failing an already low expectation. It's a fusion of hot mess with barely any charisma, only offering display of expensive cars, as the movie constantly brags, and high level of stupidity on everything it does. Fans would be better off attending car shows.Story is completely absurd, while motivations are necessary as reasons for the lethal unlawful races, the movie would've been better if characters would just race randomly. They make plot holes in every turns; it has surpassed the redeeming point long before they reach finish line. People would do things so numbingly reckless simply because Fast and Furious clearly inspired them, not to mention script and screenplay are done haphazardly, there's little to no humor or emotional investment to be had.Aaron Paul as Tobey Marshall tries to put some sense of personality with gruff voice. He looks tense and worried in almost all scenes, probably trying to decipher of the script. Imogen Poots as Julia Maddon is a complete waste of space. Never mind it's stupid for a car dealer to be involved deeply in the first place, she has neither charm nor wit to hold a scene. Probably the purpose she's badly shoehorned is she's blond and has thick English accent, a supposed independent love interest, but she's just nagging, yelling obvious things or trying to ensure the audience how radical the stunts are.The rest of ragtag team is stereotype support characters, such as the savvy mechanic, another savvy mechanic who can only be differentiated by stripping erratically, and a pilot who arrives timely with array of aerial vehicles, always cracking jokes. The movie never decides whether they are a fully coordinated team or just a bunch of clowns. And there's Michael Keaton, who passionately wants to sell the movie as if he's a used car salesman. Throwing high tag prices and misleading dramatization of what's actually a life-threatening road rage disguised as a race on par with F1, where the participants are constantly facing the threat of death or incarceration. He does a good job or narrating crash near a bus school and mocking the police as cool things.Its racing scenes are admittedly pretty decent. There are some scenes that utilize camera angles very well, like occasional drivers' perspective or strategically placed shots of near misses and crashes. They exhibit orotund energy, conveying the fast heated rivalry. If only the movie focuses more on this aspect instead of the nonsensical plot, doesn't try too hard to be pretentiously dramatic or funny, it could've been fun to watch. Furthermore, the movie is about two hours, that's a lot of time to drive in obscurity.With idiotic story, poor attempt on comedy and altogether bad acting, Need for Speed ruins yet another video game adaptation and hopefully crashes so terribly, there won't be a sequel.",Need for Speed
42,rivertam26,d.o.a.,1,13 March 2014,"Wow so I just returned from seeing need for speed based off the popular plot less video game series. Well those of you hoping for a two hr and ten minute adaptation that sticks close to the source material are in luck because this film is dreadful. Undeveloped barely one dimensional characters, an endless amount of clichés, uninspired direction, some truly terrible editing, sloppily executed cinematography and non existent 3-D. It's just too bad that Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul the main reason I saw the film shows up in a star vehicle doomed to fail and with a one note unintentionally funny, overly dramatic and forced brooding ""I swear I'm a bad ass with a heart of gold "" performance. Along for the ride are lots of annoying supporting characters a metro sexual non threatening villain and lots of pretty cars that get bashed up in the most ridiculous ways. those searching for a shred of believably should turn their sights on the fast and furious franchise because this franchise nonstarter is D.O.A.

43,ketgup83,As a NFS game fan you will not be disappointed but others might skip this,6,16 July 2014,"PC games remakes have often failed to impress the audience on the silver screen including Tomb raider , Doom , Hit-man and now NFS joins the bandwagon. A street-racer is framed on murder charge of his friend by a selfish- wealthy businessman. As he is released from the jail, he seeks revenge by participating in a cross country race and competing against highly qualified racers.From the director of Act Of Valor, Scott Waugh adapts one of the most popular game in the PC world. I like the attempt made by him but he definitely misses the train this time. As compared to his previous film, the emotions, drama and performances are definitely missing. The 1st half is sluggish with amateur acting and passable action sequences. It is the when Aaron Paul is released from the jail, things becomes interesting and with brilliantly executed police chasing scenes and breath-taking climax race will bring joy to at least NFS fans. Kudos to the action choreographer and enthralling CGI along with good camera work. Editing could be better. Background score is decent. Performances is below the mark.Overall, as a NFS game fan you will not be disappointed but others might skip this. Above average 2.75 /10",Need for Speed

What kind of doo-doo is this? Guy meets hot girl, jumps in fast car, and goes fast. Let me see, was there anything else? Hmmm – no. I kid, this was not the worst movie I ever wasted money on. For one thing, there are so many worse flicks floating around out there - and for another, I did not pay for it. So – hahahahaha. Also, this review is not all negative. There are some huge plusses I must mention. These jewels are hidden under one huge pointless- blanket, and I will try to uncover them. Aaron Paul did a good job – he spoke his lines and drove a fast car. I was very impressed. Imogen Poots played the pretty blonde to a 'T'. She superbly sat in the passenger seat, and did a fine job inhaling and exhaling - breathtaking. I almost forgot, she actually talked tooand, I think the words she spoke were extremely important to the plot. Hahahahaha – again. Just kidding – there was no plot. The rest of the cast were spectacular. They put gas in cars, got beat up or just plain raced against Aaron and Imogen. This is a must see movie.",Need for Speed
45,khanbaliq2,"Fast cars, tough guys, and spectacular vehicular destruction.",6,20 March 2014,"Need For Speed delivers where it counts. It's good shameless fun. I can't say that I like Scott Waugh's direction much, but the stunts that he films are truly impressive. That's even more impressive if you consider that the filmmakers decided against the use of CGI. The film is an upbeat ride that begins with an absorbing race featuring muscle cars and ends with one of the most impressive races ever put to film. There's some memorable racing in between, but Need For Speed noticeably slows down in the middle. This isn't a big problem because you still get to see some action and locations. However, it would have been better if the film's running time was shorter. An appealing cast was assembled to make Need For Speed a cool racing flick. English actor Dominic Cooper plays the antagonist Dino Brewster, an entrepreneur in the world of car upgrades. I like the way Cooper acts and he doesn't disappoint here. You should see Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter (2012) if you haven't already. Cooper has a part in that film. The protagonist is the blue-collar mechanic Tobey Marshall, played by Aaron Paul. Paul is also a good actor, and he sells the joyous nonsense on screen with no problems. He has some charming scenes with Imogen Poots, who plays Marshall's romantic interest Julia Maddon. One thing worth mentioning is that Need For Speed isn't like The Fast And The Furious (2001) because it's meant to be as realistic as possible. Sure, it can be cartoonish at times but it's nothing like what Vin Diesel and company are making. It's a ridiculous, loud and proud B-movie mess made with old-fashioned skill. It may also be the best movie ever adapted from a video game. I recommend it.",Need for Speed
46,Anurag-Shetty,A great film that reminds me of the brilliant video game series!,8,21 March 2014,"Need for Speed is a movie loosely based on the video game series of the same name. Tobey Marshall(Aaron Paul) is an excellent street racer. He takes part in street races to earn quick cash & pay the bills to keep his family's Automobile Service Center running. He works in the repair shop with his pals, Benny(Scott Mescudi), Finn(Rami Malek), Joe Peck(Ramon Rodriguez) & Little Pete(Harrison Gilbertson). When Marshall is framed by his arch racing nemesis, Dino Brewster(Dominic Cooper), for a tragic accident that wasn't his fault, he is arrested. Two years later, Tobey Marshall is released from prison, with nothing but revenge on his mind. This movie is sensational. The street races are mind blowing & look superb in 3D. What's even more impressive, is that most of the car racing scenes were filmed without using special effects. Instead, they used the help of professional stunt drivers & shot all the driving scenes for real. Watching the film, reminded me of the days that I used to play NFS as a kid. It is truly the best car racing video game series, & the film stays true to the pulse & style of the Need for Speed video games. The 3D has been put to good use in this film. When the characters are driving or racing those gorgeous cars, you actually feel like you're on the road with them. New York & California where the movie takes place, have been captured beautifully. The scene involving the car & the US Army chopper, is worth the ticket price alone. The performances, add to the electrifying experience of the movie. Aaron Paul stole the show as Tobey Marshall. The Breaking Bad star proves yet again, that his acting is of the highest quality, in a film that's all about racing & super cars. Dominic Cooper is brilliant as the scheming & conniving antagonist, Dino Brewster. Imogen Poots is charming & delightful as the hot Brit chick, Julia Madden. Scott Mescudi, Rami Malek, Ramon Rodriguez & Harrison Gilbertson are impressive as Benny, Finn, Joe & Pete respectively. Dakota Johnson is effective as Anita. Last but not the least, Michael Keaton is unforgettable as Monarch. If had to pick one flaw in this film, it's that there were hardly any races. They're driving cars throughout but, there's only two races in the entire film. I would have liked at least one more race. Apart from that, Need for Speed is a must watch. Start your engines!",Need for Speed
47,spookyrat1,Dumbed Down Fast & Furious Clone!,5,6 February 2021,"The Need for Speed looks good. At 132 minutes it's quite a long movie and with its dramatic content almost solely resting on extreme driving, it's unsurprising that it was directed by an ex - stuntman. Character development is shoved very much to the back seat, though Aaron Paul is more than acceptable in the lead role of former race car driver Tobey Marshall. Trouble is the rest of his team are just ciphers; they're there just to do various things to propel the plot forward and then, frequently, in sublimely unbelievable ways. None are drawn with anywhere near the depth of Dominic Toretto's extended family. Imogen Poots as Julia, an English car broker, manages to establish a reasonable chemistry as Paul's character's love interest. But even still, the actions her character takes, again fly in the face of reality. This extends even further with examples such as Michael Keaton's Monarch: a reclusive and eccentric host of a highly illegal ""underground"" supercar race competition called the De Leon. He operates from a lighthouse on a small farm where he lives, but even though he streams his races online and does live commentary (where clearly Keaton has been given carte blanche by the director, to ham it up unmercifully), he remains an unidentified enigma to the clueless authorities.Swiss cheese like plot holes like this abound in the narrative. A major aspect of the story hinges on Tobey Marshall being held responsible for an illegal race, organised by chief villain Dino Brewster (Dominic Cooper): a former Indy racer and Tobey's fierce rival. Brewster directly causes the death of another character, yet the police tell Marshall, there's no evidence of Brewster being involved with the race. Apparently in the world Need for Speed inhabits, there's no such thing as dash - cams, car registrations, or witnesses to multiple crashes involving the racing cars interactions with innocent bystanders' vehicles. Similarly during the running of the De Leon, the ""Smokies"", clearly suffer major losses as reported by Monarch, yet Marshall, is head - shakingly only given a 6 month sentence, before being set free to spin drift off into the sunset.I know the movie is only based on a video - game and many will say, we shouldn't expect high drama. But I for one, don't believe you should need to slam your brain into reverse gear to appreciate polished looking cinema vehicles like Need for Speed, which run on empty, character and story wise.",Need for Speed
48,FilmMan47,Just Another Video Game Franchise Ruined By Hollywood,3,26 March 2014,"Before i begin on this i have to say few things which include my love for cars i love fast cars & been a fan of need for speed series when i was 13 in 2003 i played road & track presents the need for speed,the second one is my most favorite NFS 2 special edition which got one fictional amazing car FZR 2000 using a cheat code it been in my memory still today if you have have played the games you should know that there was no story involved in it it was just the car and the racing track the later sequels like underground 2003 or most wanted 2005 got strong stories and guess where they came up from all the idea was it from fast and furious series that showed modified Japanese car racing hell no there were Sega and Nintendo game before this series they were good to the biggest mistake is done by EA game to give rights to the Hollywood rock star studios did the right thing by refusing the idea to make a grand theft auto film.If anyone remembers Porsche Unleashed 2000 you will know what i am saying its got all classic cars and you could do your own modification now that is a whole another story we will go in but when its adapted to the big screen there are certain rules of it like who are you making a film for the critics the gamers or yourself there are many games i loved all of them are killed by Hollywood you name it hit-man,max Payne,doom etc now this one.i like fast and furious films because they didn't ape some video game they were originals and thats why they are successful this movie tried to copy all similar racing genre films they have also given references to the game it can be seen in the film but that doesn't make it worth while as the script is a solid mess the project is directed by Scott Waugh who makes war films and is a stunt man are you kidding us and i am no fan of video game films rather watch a Steven Seagal movie these these useless films but i liked resident evil and Mortal Kombat for sure.The Plot:Tobey Marshall gets framed for a crime he never committed he wants revenge this leads to the long race with a bounty on his head as his need for speed rises with love for fast cars.The Cast:Aaron Paul trying hard to be like Paul walker but failed,what is Dominic Cooper doing here the guy cant act and thanks to Imogen Poots for giving some comedy i really missed Vin Diesel wish he was in this film.Bad dialogs & too much shaky camera movement but there is plenty of action, mountain scenes the cops helicopters and fast cars everything is here the race comes in the climax which is absolutely hilarious its a bad blend of hot pursuit it will remind you of a Michael Bay film we leave john woo alone here as he is the master of action and way better then these so called filmmakers if you like a good film with a story and action try mi2 2000 a classic film.Video game films are made for only one thing money they change the story and assemble the worst cast ever OK James bond films are made for money too but they are exiting to look at not for only action sake but for an amazing story if they are good a gamer will definitely buy one and demand a sequel in this case i don see it happening but its a disappointment for true fans of the Nfs series.Overall if you cant wait for fast and furious 7 then do watch this otherwise stay away its a waste of time looks like a parody of 90s flicks my rating for Need For Speed 2014 is 3/10.Skipp It.",Need for Speed
49,bob-the-movie-man,Petrol and Testosterone-fuelled Film (but well done),7,12 March 2014,"I'm a child of the 60's, and to me as a young boy the films of the 60's and 70's that really spoke to me were those involving cars doing dangerous things: Steve McQueen in 'Bullitt' tearing round the streets of San Francisco; the Love Bug; the Monte Carlo race in 'Grand Prix'; Bond's Lotus Esprit tearing up the roads in Sardinia and – best of all – the Mini Coopers of the original 'Italian Job', which I must have dragged my poor mother to see dozens of times. Real cars, real stunt drivers with real danger involved. These were the days before CGI, where driving scenes involving dodgy green screens were blindingly obvious. So, whilst I'm all 'grown up now' (at least in body!) 'Need For Speed' still stirs memories of those original thrills, where the engines roared and the sumps sparked on the tarmac.Let's be clear – this is a loud, bone-headed, popcorn muncher of a film. It is as obvious in terms of plot direction as you could possibly imagine. Aside from the occasional nice side-step, you just know as you meet the protagonists – the grizzled rivals, the young turk under the hero's wing, the love rival, etc. – exactly where the film will go, and it doesn't disappoint. It is no real surprise to find that director Scott Waugh was previously a stuntman on a plethora of films, including the Italian Job remake.The plot, as it is, involves rivals in the dangerous and illegal world of street racing. A tragedy during one such street race puts our hero Tobey Marshall (Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul) into the clink for a couple of years. Once released, he promptly breaks parole to cross the country to get to California in time for a head-to-head revenge rematch against his wealthy and successful rival Dino Brewster (Mamma Mia's Dominic Cooper).This Californian race along the coastline is organised by the ex-racing guru and video blog broadcaster Monarch, played with over-the-top glee by Michael Keaton. (In fact, he is so extrovert that he could be giving a great impression of Jack Nicholson at his Oscar-ceremony best!) Winner of the six-car race gets to keep all the cars: I'm not sure what the second-hand price of scrap carbon fibre is, but that probably isn't much of an incentive! Marshall is aided by the very English Jules Maddon (Imogen Poots), adding a bit of girl-power driving to the rather testosterone-heavy atmosphere.Given less to do, Dakota Johnson – shortly to star in '50 Shades of Grey' – plays the love rival of Marshall and Brewster. Scott Mescudi adds comic touches as the eye in the sky for the racers (stay for the end credits to see his amusing 'Twerkocise' inmate session) and the strikingly different Rami Malek (memorable in 'The Pacific') is excellent as one of Marshall's support crew.Where are the problems with this film? Well, a good chunk of the dialogue is inaudible, with many of the leads – notably Aaron Paul – mumbling their lines. And in terms of glorifying young people driving too fast in their cars, this film is not exactly going to help.But none of that really matters: the cars and stunt drivers are the stars of this film, and there is a nice doff of the cap to 'Bullitt' near the start of the film that recognises the rich heritage being renewed here. With the CGI switch turned to ""off"" and a plethora of real life stunts on show, this is an entertaining roller-coaster of a film, all set to a thumping and catchy soundtrack by Nathan Furst.(If you enjoyed this review, please see my archive of other reviews at bobmann447.wordpress.com, and sign up to 'Follow the Fad'.

50,Likes_Ninjas90,It could have been a lot worse but it doesn't feel essential either,5,24 March 2014,"Hollywood hasn't found a way to make films and video games gel. These are two mediums destined never to meet. Video games emphasise action, control and physical input, whereas films are linear, predetermined and focused on storytelling. Both of these mediums have become increasingly imitative of each other, without understanding their strengths and differences. Whenever a game is developed into a film it is solely for marketing purposes, a bid to draw mainstream attention to a franchise. The hasty way these films are slapped together to promote a game could explain the general low standard of most adaptations. There have been close to thirty films based on games and all have been considered failures. Twenty-eight game adaptations have been reviewed on the website Rotten Tomatoes and not one has reached over a fifty per cent fresh rating. Need For Speed was originally a video game series by Electronic Arts, who also developed the film with DreamWorks Pictures. What chance does a film based on a video game about car racing have? The film misses the mark, but not as widely as you might be thinking. The story is nonsensical and unsurprising. It is a rigidly structured revenge story that is an excuse for car chases, races and crashes. You would expect nothing less. First time screenwriter George Gatins' script is overloaded and doesn't provide enough time to breathe. Set pieces pile up on top of and over one another, which might be what car enthusiasts want but it makes the film exhausting and impersonal. No matter how well staged a car chase is it's how much you care about the character behind the wheel. Any close-up shots inside the cockpit of the cars are a meaningless visual frame of generic production line characters. Are fans of the game going to be more satisfied passively watching these racing scenes when they could be at home, playing through them themselves? With rewrites Need For Speed could have passed, of all things, as a relationship movie. Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul features as Tobey, who is released from gaol two years after being framed and is heading across country for a race against his nemesis Dino. His sidekick is an English car enthusiast, played by Imogen Poots (The Look of Love), who asks if he's going to be condescending about cars to her because she's a woman. There's a generic relationship arc that isn't psychological or deep but at least it's there. Having a real actress like Imogen Poots means her character reacts emotionally to crazy situations, like a car being turned upside down after it's latched onto a helicopter. Her face is expressive and warm so mercifully not everything is about fuel and testosterone. She almost compensates for Aaron Paul's drab performance, playing a character that lacks distinctive traits besides his glare and driving skills. It's refreshing that the film is free from guns, it's all about the cars, but the other actors offer little to the material. Dominic Cooper underwhelms as the villain and Michael Keaton overacts in an awful cameo role as a race commentator. Shane Black (Iron Man 3) was one of the producers and has assigned Scott Waugh, in just his second film after Act of Valor, as the director. He struggles outside of the action set pieces and production values. The sixty million dollar budget has gone mostly into the stylish photography by Shane Hurlbut (Into the Blue) and the car scenes, which thankfully aren't overcut. Aaron Paul says there's no CGI in the film and that all of the car scenes are real. This could be true as Scott Waugh is a former stuntman and his father was Fred Waugh, a stuntman between 1958 and 2004. These action scenes needed better pacing or straight up culling. Once the big race features at the end it feels too similar to everything before it. Scott Waugh has no feel for comedy either, attempting to inject unfunny and juvenile humour through Tobey's bro friends. Yet compared to recent action films like Olympus Has Fallen, Need for Speed is still inoffensive and occasionally shows an unexpectedly softer touch. But it's still here only to promote a video game and has no subtext to exist as anything more than that. It could have been a lot worse but it doesn't feel essential either.",Need for Speed
51,anselmdaniel,High octane fun,6,8 August 2020,"This review contains spoilers.Need for Speed stars Aaron Paul as the lead character out for revenge as he is framed for deaths caused by illegal street racing. The story follows the beginning of the illegal street race to his redemption as he clears his name. The plot is an excuse to show high octane races that are fun to watch. There are elements from the video games that are present in the movie such as police chases and traps.Need for Speed is first and foremost meant to be a fun movie. From the beginning of the movie, the cast look like they are having a fun time. The fun of the movie is dragged down by the plot and main character's dreariness. The side characters however pick up the tone and the movie becomes fun again. This movie has a fun group of side characters with stand-outs played by Imogen Poots and Rami Malek. These characters are the biggest positive in the movie. The problems of the movie are its plot and its lack of drive. The plot was not engaging. The plot only seemed to be an excuse to show its more creative racing rather than form an engrossing story and world.Even though the plot is basic, I would recommend Need for Speed. It is a competently directed movie that is high octane fun.Grade: C",Need for Speed

53,billygoat1071,Stay At The Racetracks,6,15 March 2014,"Need For Speed is probably one of the least videogames that deserve an actual film adaptation. There's only two or so games of the franchise that have a storyline and they're nowhere as remarkable as the actual gameplay. For sure, this film takes none of the source material other than the cars and the title. The story here is mostly a straightforward chase reveled with elemental cosmic hate grown by revenge. Just like the game, only the racing that brings real appeal while everything else is a filler for the sake of forming a movie. Need For Speed can be a fun blockbuster, but not all of the ideas work.The story is something not worth remembering, the simplicity at least acknowledges that the racing is the main deal here, but it's also not worth sitting through. The characters and their plight are neither remarkable nor compelling and it would be nice if they're just easy plot devices, but the movie stretches these to attempt a buildup. Unfortunately it instead makes it a long and less interesting distraction from the attraction. It only works when the cars are telling the story, shutting up the generic arcs and forced revenge movie elements that halts the excitement.Lesser the CGI, better the thrills. The stunts are magnificent in its own way, though most of the credit goes to the camera-work for completely showing the mayhem going on within those tracks. You will find plenty of inventive set pieces where the speed and ridiculous majestically outshine the typical blockbuster explosions. The direction has an excellent taste for suspense and the camera really follows the heartbeat beneath those scenes.The cast kind of improved the bland characters. Aaron Paul has the charm despite of not uttering his fans' favorite colorful language. He is more natural when he is with Imogen Poots which gives an interesting chemistry in their petty romantic subplot. Dominic Cooper boils a slight threat as the villain. And Michael Keaton preaches his enlightening racing speeches with ludicrous enthusiasm.This Need For Speed is basically like an awesome video game but with nonsensically long cutscenes, if only we can press the skip button. It is better off sticking to the speed of the action, but the film is unable to make the audience ignore the generic plot, especially when it painfully extends them so it would get a two hour runtime. Stories are good only when they're well told, well defined, and worth listening. The film should have tried a little harder. Again, the momentum and the camera-work are instantly worth the price admission and that is what the target viewers came in for. If they can take the bloat, then it is a solid entertainment.",Need for Speed
54,Rickting,Need for stopping and actually thinking about things,4,26 November 2014,"Video game adaptations are always average or below. However, this one had raised expectations as Aaron Paul was in it. He was excellent in Breaking Bad but if you saw this before BB like I did, you wouldn't have realized. Need For Speed is another bad video game movie. There's little to no plot. Something about revenge on Dominic Cooper. I watched this with an open mind and was enjoying it for the first hour. Sadly, it just started to become numbing and mechanical. What's interesting is that the cinematography is startlingly good for a film like this. It doesn't look fake and there are many good angles which are mounted on the cars. It's well made and perfectly harmless, so I don't hate it. It does drag on though. It fulfils a need for speed and has plenty of fast moving action but it lacks a human touch and is as artificial as all of the fancy cars which are endlessly displayed to us throughout. Less a film, more a stupendously silly car advert evidently sponsored by the Ford Motor Company.Aaron Paul is boring as is everyone else. There's no plot or investment. After a while, the sequences of people driving recklessly and endangering many innocent civilians including a school bus full of children just becomes uncomfortable. The film is totally insane and isn't the worst of it's kind you'll ever see but it feels like a massive waste of time. There was no need whatsoever for it to be 2 hours and it could have been 40 minutes shorter. Nothing feels real and authentic and there isn't a sense of charm either. There isn't enough humour or fun. It's all just car crashes, car races, car glorifying and more cars. I love action films, so I enjoyed much of this film but by the time the big finale came around I was no longer very interested in the film at all. It needed some kind of plot and actual characters. Unfortunately it doesn't really have any of that. A forgettable but sometimes fun action thriller, and perfectly watchable. If only it's been half an hour shorter.4/10",Need for Speed
55,DareDevilKid,"Car Mayhem, Insane Chases, Races, Thrills, and Action Galore!",8,18 July 2014,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.9/5 starsEverything a car-action movie ought to be, and then some more! Stated to be based on the insanely popular, eponymous video game franchise (in actuality the similarity between the movie and game ends at their titles, which isn't really a bad thing, considering the games never needed to concentrate on their plots and story arcs), the film doesn't letup for a single minute, and though you embark on this ride with little or no expectations, within minutes of the sojourn, you're compelled to fasten your seat-belts, and zoom away with the thrills and testosterone fueled romp this action-packed bonanza of a film provides.But those ready to nitpick the movie for being all zest and no zeal needn't fret, because ""Need For Speed"" boasts of a surprisingly engaging plot with heart, drama (albeit a tad sugarcoated), and a no-frills coherence. The simple story arc of a fresh from prison street racer joining a cross country race with the intent of exacting revenge on a wealthy business associate who framed him for murder, blends well with the theme of the film and offers good scope for taking the action forward. As the plot unfolds the business associate, learning of our hero's plan, places a massive bounty on his head before the race commences, thereby providing myriad opportunities for some ultra-cool chase scenes, gob-smacking stunts, and edge-of-the seat action.Aaron Paul (after displaying ample proof of his acting credentials on the mega-successful TV show, Breaking Bad), as expected, essays his character with gusto and conviction, but what really comes across as a surprise is the ease with which he cruises into the boots of a leading man, that too in an action movie. As the leading lady, Imogen Poots plays an apt foil to Paul's deep persona, and provides welcome comic relief along with Scott Mescudi in a hilarious role. Of the remaining cast, Ramon Rodriguez, Dominic Cooper (tremendous improvement over his previous outings), and Rami Malek are worth mentioning. Lastly, it's a pleasure to see Michael Keaton after ages in a major production, and he literally steals some of the scenes in a small but dynamic role.Director, Scott Waugh, smartly refrains from showcasing any hand-to-hand fight scenes featuring his protagonist, since this might have come across as unbelievable and gimmicky, owing to Paul's lithe physique. Overall, Waugh's direction is credible and he builds a pacy narrative for the film, while exhibiting special mastery over the action sequences (you might see Waugh being tapped by studios for other action projects). The action sequences (read car chases and racing scenes) are some of the best ever depicted on film, and along with Waugh's assured direction, equal credit for this must go to Shane Hurlbut's cinematography, and the editing by Paul Rubell and Scott Waugh himself.If you are in the mood for an adrenaline-pumped, pacy action ride, then ""Need for Speed"" is sure to satiate your appetite to the fullest. Fans of car-based films and action movies in general will instantly fall in love with this film. For those who don't share a vigorous fondness for action films; give ""Need for Speed"" a chance, and you just might be pleasantly surprised as it grown in you over the course of two hours.",Need for Speed
56,RevRonster,"Yep, it still seems impossible to make a video game adaptation...",1,25 September 2014,"Someday, there will be a day where video game adaptations hit their golden era like comic book adaptations did but, until that happens, we need to be patient. Sadly, until we see that day arrive, we have to deal with stuff like ""Need For Speed."" It's easy to write off ""Need For Speed"" as a ""Fast and the Furious"" wannabe but it really just felt like a lazy game adaptation to me more than anything. The story is extremely ridiculous and the performances are cheesy. Aaron Paul comes off very unlikable for most of the movie and unconvincing as the super-cool, dangerously skilled racer. The racers all look like they really need to use the bathroom or are thinking of a really funny joke in their heads when they are racing and the film severely lacks in the ""speed"" promise of the title. Races are usually slow-moving and boring as they rely on racer's reactions and a complete slowdown and stop of action with drifting, cornering, and cutting people off.One thing I liked about ""Need For Speed,"" though, was the inclusion of Michael Keaton. He was fun, charismatic, and giving his all to the role even though the rest of the cast appears to be cheesing it up. Sadly, he's only in the film for very short periods of time.Overall, ""Need For Speed"" is just forgettable and was only slightly relevant due to Paul's epic portrayal of Jesse Pinkman in ""Breaking Bad.""

57,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Needs More Speed,4,14 March 2014,"Fresh from TV's BREAKING BAD, which recently ran its course, Aaron Paul not only has a starring movie role but gets the Indiana Jones treatment: the camera pans up to his back as he turns around slowly, and the character, Tobey Marshall, is unveiled in cinematic glory...What follows is a noisy street race or two, and in-between we meet Tobey's fellow mechanics, all with their own distinctive personalities (yet seeming quite similar): one tries hard to be funny and quirky, another is mellow and quiet, and there's a young friendly sort And last but not least, up in the air is a cocky helicopter pilot who calls the shots allowing, as the movie progresses, Tobey to escape the police: And to think Burt Reynold's Bandit had only a truck driver helping out.Times have changed in fast car cinema: Gone are the days of Reynolds and Steve McQueen flicks, thanks (or no thanks) to the glossy FAST AND FURIOUS franchise, although we do get shots of BULLITT playing at a drive-in theater...And in a more subliminal fashion, NEED FOR SPEED goes retro with a plot reminiscent of the cult classic VANISHING POINT, where Barry Newman has to travel cross country to be in San Francisco in a certain amount of time, backed by a rebellious disc jockey who has morphed into Michael Keaton as a pirate Internet host making a viral folk hero out of Tobey, zipping from New York to Frisco in order to race the sneering villain, who caused an untimely death: Because of this street race tragedy, Tobey was imprisoned for two years and now ardently seeks good old fashion revenge.The best scenes not only involve car chases but at one point, our tomboy ingénue and shotgun rider, Julia, tautly escapes from a cop on foot – but everything eventually leads back to that supped up, million dollar vehicle. With so much time spent crossing America, the climactic race, taken way too seriously by Keaton's Roman Chorus, not only means very little but feels pretentiously tacked-on compared to the country spanning mainline.Which is part of the film's overall problem: with brooding self indulgence invested in our intrepid hero, played a bit too cool and smug by Aaron Paul who has little motivation to stretch beyond a permanent scowl and hissing voice the story winds up needing more speed and less melodrama.",Need for Speed

Hey let's be honest, that's the reason why the movie got greenlit in the first place and it failed to do that.Aaron Paul is not replacing Paul Walker, bitch!! I'm not getting leading man from this dude. He does got everyday Joe who happens to have one awesome skill down, but I'm not feeling him as the center of the movie.It's more similar to the movie Cannonball or Cannonball run, but the assemble cast did not have enough interesting characters for me. It's like a make your own movie situation where you take a typical generic stereotype and add it.I did like the car chases, which is the most important part right? it was cool seeing the expensive cars being raced just like in the game. I wish there was more of those. I feel like I may be too hard on this movie because I'm a huge fan of the game it's named after. I should note that I became a fan with the 3rd game, Hot Pursuit and this might be why the movie does not follow the game as closely as I would like it too.Not really worth the 3D.

63,Cinemaniac1984,"No story, no appeal, and no purpose. Keep on driving.",1,21 May 2016,"Best on the best selling Need for Speed video game franchise, Need for Speed was going to be a bad idea for a movie the moment a script was produced to be filmed. It had no appeal whatsoever. As it turns out within less than 10 minutes of the start of the movie it was destined to be a disastrous wreck. Need for Speed was another bad movie that I could not even finish. And with a torturous running time of 132 minutes I made the right decision not to waste anymore time and stopped watching Need for Speed. Lame acting all round, unfortunately Aaron Paul (well known as Jesse Pinkman from TV's Breaking Bad) has found himself stuck in a complete dud of a movie. And what was Michael Keaton (Batman, Batman Returns) doing in this movie?! Everyone else doesn't rate a mention.The story (or lack thereof) just consists of street racing and flash looking cars, something that would not look out of place out of The Fast and the Furious franchise. This is just a movie with very little to no appeal and no purpose except to entertain which fails miserably to do so. If you want to check it out, you will feel dumber after watching it. If you're a huge fan of Breaking Bad and you want to see Aaron Paul in something else prepare to be very, very disappointed.Keep on driving past and avoid this unappealing dud of a movie.1/10.",Need for Speed
64,Magow-Intermean,Need For Speed Review,7,25 March 2019,"Mechanic Tobey Marshall (Paul) is framed for the death of his friend by racer Dino Brewster (Cooper). After two years in the clink, he sets off on a road trip of revenge, bent on besting Dino at De Leon - a legendary underground street race.
You can just imagine the pitch that gave rise to Need For Speed. ""It'll be the new Fast & Furious! We'll base it on a huge gaming IP, throw in some young, affordable actors and pack it with car porn. Win! You think we need a hook? Huh. Say, have you seen Breaking Bad?""
And so Aaron Paul, who delivers what is arguably the best performance in one of television's most lauded dramas, ends up driving across America in a film that makes Fast 6 look like Battleship Potemkin. It's not so much that Need For Speed is stupid, which is all but mandatory in this genre, but that stuntman-turned-director Scott Waugh fails to work the trick that Diesel et al have down pat: make the stupidity fun.
The car-eography lacks much of the balls-out audacity we've come to enjoy from pistonhead outings, stuck mostly in second gear thanks to lethargic editing and an over-reliance on long shots. That one (bafflingly over-wrought) set-piece involves Imogen Poots climbing out of a window to fill the car up with petrol should tell you all you need to know about the level of invention on show here.
It doesn't have the video game to blame either, sharing almost nothing beyond the title and opting for an entirely new story that doesn't bear a great deal of scrutiny. You'll never understand why Dino (Dominic Cooper) not only leaves damning evidence lying about but keeps a shortcut to it on his desktop, nor how Michael Keaton's mysterious DJ/race organiser manages to keep his identity secret while live-broadcasting his show via webcam. But as Paul and Poots dangle upside down over the Grand Canyon arguing about whose eyes are bluer, what will baffle most is how a film called Need For Speed can feel so slow.
Paul emerges as the film's one saving grace, imbuing Tobey with steely earnest and storming through the revenge-themed bunkum with complete abandon. As his first post-Pinkman lead, however, this is a disappointing misstep for an actor of Paul's potential.",Need for Speed
65,xamtaro,Need fulfilled.,7,16 September 2014,"When a need for speed movie was first announced, people questioned its necessity. After all, a movie based around exotic cars, high octane races, police chases and racing rival had already been made and it is called THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS. Fortunately, 3 movies into the franchise and the Vin Diesel star vehicle dissed its racing concept and became a series of straight up heist movies. NEED FOR SPEED fills the vacuums it left with a plot focused squarely on racing instead of having racing as a side dish to a police/criminal cat and mouse game.Taking its name from the long running Need For Speed video game franchise, NEED FOR SPEED manages to...........wait what? A video game movie? Yup, we can all hear the critics putting on their prejudice cap and throwing out the mandatory scathing review. All things considered, yes NEED FOR SPEED is not award winning material. It has a done-to-death ""underdog out for revenge against a big wig"" storyline, simplistic characterisations, and every single racing movie cliché you can think off.Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul stars as Tobey Marshall, a down-on-his-luck mechanic who enters night time street races to try and keep his shop out of the red. One day, Tobey and his pals get hired by his childhood rival turned millionaire Dino Brewster to customise a one of a kind Ford Mustang. When Tobey's earnest nature and driving skills wins him the favour of Julia, who purchases the car, Dino challenges Tobey and his best friend Pete to a race. Too proud to lose, Dino knocks Pete off road to his death during the race, implicating Tobey as the prime suspect. Now Tobey serves his time and gets out of jail with vengeance and a plan. Catch the attention of the mysterious ""Monarch"" who runs the De Leon cross country race, outrun the cops, and get his revenge against Dino.The whole story in this movie, the characters, the cars, the races, the very style of the cinematography; it is all the pure distillation of the games' concepts. For those who had played the Need For Speed games, this movie is a real thrill as it pays tribute to most of the signature concepts of past games. The whole underground race organised by Michael Keaton's ""Monarch"" hearkens back to ""Need For Speed: Underground"" series, the main character and his crew of mechanics pays tribute to ""Need for Speed Carbon"", the various police chases and the fact that our character is an ex-convict on the run is right up there with ""Hot pursuit"" and ""Most Wanted"". Even the main car and the holographic heads up display is exactly like in the games.Clichéd story aside, NEED FOR SPEED is surprisingly well done. Cinematography is magnificent not just for a video game movie but for any movie. Shots are bright whether day or night, colours are rich and vibrant without breaking the sense of reality, and beautiful locales are brought to life with wide steady camera angles. A far cry from the typical jitter cam and quick cuts that plagues car scenes in movies. Perhaps the most impressive is the fact that most of the movie is done with practical effects.On a side note, the script does allow our actors to shine despite . The love/hate bickering between Aaron Paul's Tobey and Imogen Poots' Julia is a real treat showing the chemistry the two actors cook up between each other. We get a good peppering of witty laugh-out-loud humour particularly from Tobey's mechanic crew pals. Do not expect dialogue that is layered or complicated though. This is straight up good guy underdog vs rich bad guy smug snake. Between Dino's evil scowling and Tobey trying his darnedest to master the ""intense"" stare, the subplot about their rivalry seems to hold as much weight as a rivalry between playground bullies.So yes, NEED FOR SPEED is in no way avant grade cinema with its level of storytelling and dialogue. It is however a very enjoyable racing movie and one good example of how to properly capture the essence of a video game despite detracting from in-game story lines. Accompanied by an astounding soundtrack that sounds like a cover mix of Brian Tyler and Hans Zimmer, NEED FOR SPEED is fun, exciting and an all out thrill to watch despite its shortcomings. Until the FAST AND FURIOUS series ditches the overdone heist/chase plots, NEED FOR SPEED is here providing pure adrenaline pumping blockbuster racing to fill that gap.",Need for Speed

Why is he looking at the ground for 90% of the time? Main actor not looking at people's eyes is just too weird. Also, throwing your tail in EVERY turn slows you down, it doesn't make you go faster.The second half is slightly better. Just put your brains in neutral and skip to the car chases, since the ""plot"" is awful.

I acknowledge that there are many things wrong with the movie, it is a very basic story that doesn't manage to pull off anything original and has considerable problems in storytelling, but I just could not help being engaged with it: I was actually interested in the outcome (although it was pretty predictable) and had my fun time at the theater.",Need for Speed

69,shawneofthedead,"A cheerful jumble of genres, with an over-complicated plot but surprisingly fun characters.",6,15 March 2014,"Nobody watches car chase movies for a plot - or the characters. Right? Both those elements - typically crucial in films - simply serve as vehicles (sorry) to rev up the action: they will, inevitably, get ground up in the gears and lost to the crush, tumble and burn of cars squealing around race-tracks. To Need For Speed's credit, some care has actually been lavished upon the film's script: not enough to win it any awards, certainly, but more than you'd expect. That makes this video-game adaptation a surprisingly smooth, fun watch: undemanding, amusing entertainment that's not quite as swiftly-paced as the many racing scenes that round out its running time.Tobey Marshall (Aaron Paul), racer extraordinaire by night, runs a garage left to him by his father by day. Strapped for cash, he agrees to help his nemesis Dino (Dominic Cooper) fix up a legendary racing car - one which is quickly purchased by Julia (Imogen Poots) for her rich boss. When Dino frames Tobey for a tragic crime committed during a street race, Tobey is forced to do time - and is eager for revenge when he's finally released from prison. What ensues is a crazy mish-mash of genres and ideas, all spliced together with bruising car chase sequences. There's the odd-couple buddy comedy, as Tobey drives across the country - breaking his parole - with Julia on board to guard the fancy car he fixed up. Need For Speed is meant to be a deep, dark thriller too, probably, as Dino places a bounty on Tobey's head to ensure that they'll never meet again. Finally, it's a balls-out sports flick, heavy on testosterone, as everyone heads to California to take part in a most prestigious illegal race organised by Monarch (Michael Keaton). Jaw-dropping stunts abound, most of which were filmed for real and not created with special effects.As it turns out, the surprising joy of Need For Speed comes in neither its rather convoluted plot (quite laboured), nor in its numerous races (good fun but rather like watching someone else play a video game for a couple of hours). Oddly, what will stay with you in this film - at least, if you're not a fan of the original video game series - are the characters. Julia, in particular, proves to be a nice touch in a male-dominated movie: a feminine presence who's every bit as tough and brave as her co-stars, she banters and bickers with Tobey in a way that clearly wins his respect - and ours. There's welcome comic relief, too, in the form of helicopter pilot Benny (Scott Mescudi), who cracks jokes from high in the sky, as he scopes out a safe route for Tobey's car.Fresh off his starring role in smash-hit television series Breaking Bad, Paul makes a decent enough stab at going Hollywood: he spends much of the film glowering through his windscreen, full of pent-up rage and darkness, and mines some emotional truths from Tobey's plight. Poots and Mescudi are quite charming, just about managing to keep their characters from grating on the nerves, and Cooper stalks malevolently through the film as a full-fledged villain.There's no denying that Need For Speed is cluttered and over-long, its plot occasionally bordering on too complicated for a movie powered by super-fast cars. But, on the whole, it zips by in largely inoffensive fashion, shored up by frequent blasts of cheeky humour and a cast who actually defy genre conventions by turning many of their characters from caricatures into people. For a cheerful, brainless night out at the cinema, you could certainly do worse.",Need for Speed

72,trublu215,Surprisingly well done,5,8 March 2014,"I got to see an advanced screening of Need For Speed and I must say, despite a 2hr 10min running time, this film was extremely entertaining from start to finish. The film follows Toby, played by Aaron Paul, and his quest for revenge against a billionaire racer, played by Dominic Cooper, who killed his friend. The film's familiar plot gets excused for the mere fact that the action sequences in this film are amazing and keep you holding your breath. The lack of CGI is jaw dropping. It makes the action sequences in Fast & Furious 6 look like more of a video game than the basis for this film. It truly is amazing. Aaron Paul is very good in this film, while he is nowhere near the caliber of his famous Jesse Pinkman from Breaking Bad, he still proves that he is an amazing actor with great things ahead of him. Another surprise here is Kid Cudi, who gives a light hearted touch to the rough and tough story of revenge. Michael Keaton is another welcomed addition to this film as he lets the viewer get a better idea of who our anti-hero, Toby Marshall, truly is. Dominic Cooper is a down side of the film, unfortunately he weighs down the film with a typical evil billionaire performance, the only think he is missing is his pinky finger against his lips but it is just enough to overlook. Getting back to the basis of this movie, this is hands down the best video game adaptation ever made. It's hard to believe when watching it that this is a video game adaptation because it is actually good. This comes as proof that with good actors and directing, video games can be adapted correctly.",Need for Speed
73,Jerghal,More than a cheap FF knock-off,8,13 July 2014,"What always bugged me about The Fast & The Furious is that there were not enough good car races. Also there haven't been any good movies based on computer games with a few exceptions (Resident Evil, Silent Hill). Need for Speed solves both problems. Okay, so the story clearly serves as an excuse for the races but altogether it works reasonably well and the actors aren't too bad. Aaron Paul portrays a believable hero you can identify with. Michael Keaton was quite annoying as some sort of hipster radio presenter that really didn't add anything to the film. The writers did their best incorporating some typical elements from the video games series like police car and helicopter chases, references to the spike strips, a incar screen with the typical game screen graphics and racing scenery that looks a bit like seacrest county. Obligatory the hero must have an obsession with American muscle cars (which we all know are crap) but by the final race they all get to use the supercars we all know and love from the games. The main attraction are the races and they are pretty well done. DP Shane Hurlbut (T4) used a plethora of 50 digital cameras to film the action from all angles and it really helps selling the sense of speed (which we do need in a film with this title). The crashes were done mostly practical with car shells augmented by some VFX. It didn't happen a lot but some VFX shots did look a bit fake (like some cars on fire or flips). In all certainly a very enjoyable film that's not a cheap FF knock-off. It made 203m$ worldwide so there's a good chance they develop it into a franchise. Bring on the next one!",Need for Speed
74,ghost_dog86,Fast & Furious 6 ½,3,16 March 2014,"Talk about striking while the iron is room temperature. ""Need for Speed"", a video game series which hit its peak popularity maybe ten years ago, is a clear instance of the type of blockbuster movie ideas we get around this time of year. Stiff writing, stiff delivery and ultra cliché story structure (which is weird since there isn't a whole lot of plot here) all come together to tell the tale of ex-con Tobey Marshall, who after a gruesome car accident takes the life of one of his best friends, is now bent on revenge. His plans of revenge revolve around venturing on a completely improbable road trip to California in order to enter a super top secret race put on by the most annoying man in the world (played by Michael Keaton in the worst performance of his career) and beating the villainous Dino Brewster (played by Dominic Cooper, whose career after ""The Devil's Double"" has been an utter disappointment). Doesn't make a whole lot of sense? Well, it shouldn't. But the less one focuses on the story, the more bearable this film will be. It is the surprisingly edge of your seat impressive car racing sequences (with some cool POV effects that nicely captures actual gameplay) which keep this film afloatsomewhat. So, kudos to director Scott Waugh for making something out of absolutely nothing. That said, the ONLY reason to see this movie is for these sequences, which there are thankfully many of. Full disclosure, the only reason I went to see ""Need for Speed"" was because of Jesse Pinkman aka Aaron Paul. Also, full disclosure, Paul undoubtedly only obtained the leading role in ""Need for Speed"" off of the success of the mega hit TV show ""Breaking Bad"". The harsh truth is (and I hate to say this, since I am one of those who feel that ""Breaking Bad"" is the greatest dramatic series of all time) that Aaron Paul is a lifetime character actor that can really only play one type of character; and Tobey Marshall isn't it. I mean, his performance wasn't bad, but let's just say: this particular Paul was no Paul Walker.Final Thought: Truthfully, things do come together rather nicely in the final 30, but the simple fact is that ""Need for Speed"" is 130 minutes long! Meaning, many of the more car novice audience members will have tuned out long before things get good. In short, rather than paying to see this movie, ""Need for Speed"" is one that probably could (and should) be seen for free on TBS in a year or so.",Need for Speed
75,JaydoDre,An bland disjointed story mixed in with good car action,7,16 March 2014,"OK ladies and gentlemen, please try to identify what you want to see in this movie: 1. A movie, with story and characters 2. Racing and destruction of cool cars If you opt for No 1, then you may be severely disappointed. Though, what do you expect going into a racing game adaptation called ""Need for Speed""? If you are here for the 2nd option then I should warn you that you will have to sit through a lot of bad filler before you will get to the good parts. In fact, Need For Speed is only Need for Speed in the last 20 minutes or so, while the first part of the movie is muddied with a dumb plot. Perhaps you would be well advised to wait until the action bits from the movie get cut into a 5 minute video on the internet and watch that instead.Aaron Paul, who plays the main hero, made it into the spotlight after the show Braking Bad, but to this day I do not understand the appeal. In Breaking Bad he was an annoying spastic paper-thin character whose range was between cussing and being a silent background to whatever Bryan Cranston had to say in the foreground. And in Need for Speed he continues to be a most generic and boring good guy. Yes, the man can act, but the makers of this film haven't given him anything to do with that ability.Then there is a number of side characters. Rami Malek as one of our hero's crew members is kind of adorable when he gets his own scene, but that just shows that he should not be in this movie. Then there is Michael Keaton as the underground race organizer who chews the scenery so wonderfully that it is a shame that he does not get more airtime in this movie. The rest of the crew, especially the pair of boobs played by Julia Maddon as the main hero's secondary love interest, are pointless and a little annoying. Regardless of their personal appeal, the dialogue given to all of them is so bland that only Keaton can sell it.As for the story, it is so disjointed, bland and full of illogical events that you will be begging for the movie to get to the good part: the driving. The scenes shot from first-person view look especially good. They should do them more often in movies. Expensive cars flying around and causing destruction is always fun to watch. Frankly, that is all that this movie needed to be: just some racing with fun music playing in the backgroundbut not trance though. I know trance would be fun if you were driving the car, but not if you are watching itsorry, I'm digressing. Unfortunately, every time the movie finally gets to the driving part, the story wrestles its way back in and reallyslowsthingsdoooooown.Considering this is movie is a game adaptation, it is not a bad one. Sadly, this is also its downside. If it was terrible we could have at least laughed at it. People could have made funny video reviews about it, ripping it apart. Instead, it is just an average movie with some cool cars mixed in.At least these people did not go down the path of the macho show-off culture of the Fast and Furious films and I thank them for that.",Need for Speed

77,tr91,Does exactly what it set out to do,8,21 February 2015,"Need for Speed does exactly what it set out to do. I didn't take it too seriously and I ended up having a lot of fun. There's plenty of beautiful cars and fast paced racing, with excellent sound effects. I would say I enjoyed it as much as my favourite Fast & Furious film to date, which is Fast 5.I'm not really sure why anyone with no interest in racing would watch it but it actually had a decent storyline to boot. It wasn't just non stop pure racing, we had a proper story to follow which allowed me anyway, to connect with the characters. There was motive behind it all.I was pretty impressed with Aaron Paul in the lead role although I kept thinking of Jesse from Breaking Bad, as if he was on the run. Imogen Poots was a charming character as well. The film on the whole was pretty cheesy but if you don't take it too seriously its very entertaining and I wouldn't bet against there being a sequel. Overall as good as I could have hoped for.8/10.",Need for Speed
78,kunalkhandwala,"If you've played the games, you owe it to yourself...",7,13 April 2014,"The world's most successful racing video game that let players ride in the most desirable cars was the obvious choice for a movie franchise that could fill the gap between two Fast and Furious movies. While there isn't much that one can do about a storyline when it comes to pure adrenaline pumping street racing in fancy cars, George and John Gatins try and make the most out of a generic revenge plot. Directed by Scott Waugh (XXX, Act of Valor), 'Need for Speed' features some jaw dropping stunt sequences and credible action that are attributed to his decision to use less CGI and more actual stunt work with the mean machines. The most rewarding aspect of watching NFS on the big screen is that these super-cars are driven at manic speeds almost all the time. Tobey (Aaron Paul) is now out of prison and is keen on seeking revenge for his wrongful incarceration and his friend's death that was actually caused by the rich kid Dino (Dominic Cooper). Two years ago, his family's failing garage operation had to be salvaged with a job to build Carroll Shelby's incomplete prototype of the 5oth anniversary special 2012 Ford Mustang. Dino had acquired this car and was offered to sell it to a British buyer who would only buy it if it could touch 235 mph. Tobey pushed the car to that record speed on a track and won a part of the proceeds. However, the conniving Dino challenges Tobey and his protégé Pete to a winner- takes-all race in identical street illegal Swedish Koenigsegg supercars. Towards the end of an exhilarating road rash at incredible speeds, Tobey deliberately brakes before Pete's car, to send him airborne over a bridge and down into an inferno of death. In a sinister move, he leaves the scene and covers up the trace of his red Koenigsegg, resulting in the wrongful arrest of Tobey. He now plans on beating Dino in the secretive De Leon race in California that is organized by the internet's mysterious commentator Monarch (Michael Keaton). For that, he asks the Brit buyer for his Mustang with the lure of prize money and accompanied by Julia (Imogen Poots), he sets off for a super fast cross country drive to San Francisco from the East Coast. The perilous journey turns out to be a chase by cops and goons who are enticed by Dino's declaration of a bounty on the Mustang. Benny (Scott Mescudi) may occasionally rescue our hero via borrowed planes and helicopters but it is in San Francisco, that Tobey suffers a big blow. His ex-girlfriend who is now Dino's girl, learns the truth about her evil lover and helps Tobey find a new ride for the De Leon race, which turns out to be the missing Red Koenigsegg. The climax is a revenge-driven race through Mendocino that lives up to the NFS legend of high octane action at astounding speeds. As this story unfolds, the audience is frequently thrilled by chase sequences and stunts on the cross-country drive. Waugh does not forget what the audience has paid to watch and with minimal CGI, he makes the stunts as realistic as possible to give a jaw dropping effect. Combine that with the sheer speed at which the actors race in these super-cars and you have a winning combination for a joyous time in theaters. The astounding scenes include the drag race through Mount Kisco's streets, the police chase through Detroit and the insane jump over the highway, the Apache helicopter rescue over Utah's gorges, the high speed driving against traffic which makes one's insides stir, the high speed refueling while driving and the frantic racing in Mendocino with some of the fastest cars around. However, the most spectacular stunt work and action piece is the red car's horrific accident as it launches in air, hits a pole with ferocity and descends from the bridge into the fiery ball. Aaron Paul of 'Breaking Bad' fame is suitable both as a revenge-driven racer and a fun companion to ride cross-country with. Imogen Poots is the iconic girlfriend one would want (she can drive like a racer and is British). Scott Mescudi is funny whenever he's flying around and checking out unrelated objects when he needs to look out for traffic. Rami Malek as the talented designer in the team is hilarious in his departure from a worldly job while Michael Keaton plays a very excited commentator for whom this race is life-changing. Dominic Cooper plays the sinister villain who is always resourceful with his bag of dirty tricks but he leaves a bit to be desired as Paul's acting nemesis. Need for Speed is certainly an exhilarating time at the movies and Scott Waugh has brilliantly portrayed the high-speed racing and stunt sequences. Although the NFS franchise will not rival the sheer entertainment in the Fast & Furious series, it can surely work as an ideal filler between its two parts. If you've played the games since childhood, it really is an adrenaline rush to watch the super-cars burn rubber in excess of 100mph. 7.303 on a scale of 1-10.",Need for Speed
79,chappywatched,Chappy Watched: Need For Speed,2,7 May 2016,"Congratulations, Need For Speed! You have officially joined the ranks of my Top 10 Worst Film's of All Time!I could have turned this off in just the first 30 minutes but I sat through it and I can tell you, I did NOT get any better.It's cliché and predictable. The acting is nothing special, Aaron Paul sounded like he was channeling Christian Bale's Batman voice.Apparently these cars are also very hard to destroy, all that they are put through and most of them still look immaculate.The only highlight of the film, minimal as it is, is Michael Keaton, who seems to just be playing Beetlejuice but without the make-up.Save yourself the time, don't watch this car wreck!",Need for Speed
80,lucasnochez,Review: Need For Speed,8,14 March 2014,"I remember the first time I saw the Fast and the Furious, and how it  made me feel after leaving the theatre. By the time the credits rolled,  I wanted to get into my car and drivefast. Unfortunately at the time,  I was just barely fourteen years-old and not even able to drive, let  alone drive fast. Since then, there have been five more entries to the  Fast franchise, a tragic death within the series and an upcoming  seventh entry that will no doubt pay homage to the late, great racing  action star Paul Walker. Obvious comparisons from this film will be  made to the Fast film franchise, but I can assure you that Need for  Speed will gracefully race near to, if not speed right in front of the  series that made street racing cool.  When was the last time you saw a car fly? Like actually fly? And I'm  not talking about the CGI filled James Bond/science-fiction films that  show flying cars with wings as the norm in the future. For the first  time in a very long time at the movies, I had fun! I held my arms  close, my palms were sweaty, and tension was flowing through me like  the warm synthetic engine oil of a race car, and it was all thanks to  the high-octane energy of Need for Speed.  Based on the famous video game franchise of the same name released in  1994, the film had many hurdles to overcome even before its release;  horrible track records among critics and in the box office for video  game film adaptations (Super Mario Bros., Doom, Max Payne); direct  comparisons to the Fast films; and a television star Aaron Paul  (Breaking Bad) leading the film. But despite all the hurdles, Need for  Speed delivers on its promise for an urgency to entertain, enthral, and  perform, giving a whole new realism to the illegal street racing action  genre.  Now the word realism can be misconstrued in the context of this review.  The disclaimer at the end of the film does state that ""many of the  stunts performed were done by trained professionals on closed courses"",  including the actors, who had extensive training with street cars and  performance racing. Now when I say realism, there is no way we can  explain that word without mentioning director Steve Waugh. Waugh, who  was a seasoned stunt performer before he became a director (Act of  Valor), on films like Bad Boys II, Spider-Man and The Italian Job,  opted for genuine stunt performances from his actors, director of  photography, and stuntmen, and mostly abandoned the use of CGI in the  film, which gives a slight edge to the longing of danger to be put back  into filmmaking.  The video games, which popularized the use of 'first-person racing',  put gamers in the driver's seat and revolutionized the way in which  racing games were made. Need for Speed may be light on story,  completely absurd on intent and plot, and have many two-dimensional  characters, but makes up for it in action, thrills, and impulsive  entertainment. The film then becomes a blend of buddy comedy/road-trip  actioner/hard boiled revenge thriller that will have you rooting for  our hero and born underdog Tobey Marshall, with every gear shift and  sharp turn ahead.  The film spends a hefty amount of time establishing its characters,  especially its lead Tobey Marshall (Paul). A natural behind the wheel  but behind on most of his payments on the shop his late father left him  in Mt. Kisco, N.Y, Marshall makes up for his payments and barely keeps  the shop afloat and his close friends employed through a string of  minor street races. After a generous offer from an old acquaintance,  pro NASCAR driver and suave bad boy Dino Brewster (Dominic Cooper),  Marshall sees an opportunity for the business to flourish for him and  his group of loyal friends. But after Dino double-crosses Marshall in a  race for winner-takes-all, Marshall serves two years in prison, only  igniting a burning scheme for vengeance.  Need for Speed spends a dedicated amount of time behind the wheel with  it's characters. From the moment Marshall is released from prison, he  makes his way to California to the infamous, invite only De Leon street  race, held by an anonymous organizer. Desperate to use the last car  that he and his team worked on, a 50th Anniversary Ford Mustang that  Carroll Shelby reportedly worked on before his eventual death in 2012,  a car that produces 800+ horsepower and reaches a max speed of 234mph,  Marshall and his team, accompanied by the wealthy investor associate  Julia (Imogen Poots) race to an unknown location in search of proving  Marshall's innocence and making Brewster pay for the death of his  friend.  In addition to the hundreds of cars and parts that were damaged during  the production of the film, is the passion and very obvious enjoyment  of everyone involved. From Cooper, who has been very open about his  excitement to be in a racing film since the beginning of his career, to  Paul, who spent months dedicated to stunt driving, Need for Speed is a  film that can best be described by its resident veteran franchise  patriarch Michael Keaton, a film that was ""born to ride"".",Need for Speed
81,priyantha-bandara,Most probably only gamers will love this,5,19 July 2014,"As there is a common belief that soccer is the universal sport of planet earth if you ask a gamer what is the universal game they would most probably say Need for Speed or NFS. It's nearly impossible to find serious gamer who have not played even a single edition of NFS. And for the love of the game the long awaited Need for Speed movie is here and from a gamers perspective it's everything they can ask for. But from a movie fans perspective there are critical downsides to it. So before you watch this think to which category you belong to. I as a person who played NFS from the very beginning when the game was supported on DOS and had nothing much to offer than pixelated moving objects have no reason to dislike the movie. The plot is very straight forward. When street racer Tobi Marshall (Aaron Paul) is betrayed and sent to prison he has no other ambition than proving himself right. Once released he find a fast ride and get in to the legendary undercover street race to beat his rival.For anyone who liked Need for Speed there are definitely two reasons, the nearly fantasy collection of super cars and the long races. That's right. Need for Speed has some cars that blow your speed brains out. For motor heads its porn and the movie follow its games lead and pump in some really expensive rides. The awesome collection includes 2013 Shelby GT500, Saleen S7, Lamborghini Sesto Elemento, McLaren P1, GTA Spano, Bugatti Veyron Super Sport and Koenigsegg Agera. I'm quite certain that it's the most expensive car line up in a movie so far 'if' they were the real deal. But then again for movies like this with so many of them get crashed at the end the real cars with real specs are out of limits. Apart from the cars the races are quite well done. However as the bar is already set up very high by the all-time king of street race movies Fast and Furious, Need for Speed is lacking some innovation there. But still the races are very entertaining and full of destruction.Why Need for Speed fails to make a mark as a movie is for obvious reasons. To start with the plot is very lose and utterly impractical. You can say the same about Fast and Furious too but F&F had some charm in the cast (Heavily with Vin Diesel and Paul Walker) that made the fans forgive the movies crappy plot holes. But NFS is lacking that charm and it doesn't look good. Aaron Paul is a good actor made his way up the ladder with the awesome TV show Breaking Bad but it seems like this role is not something that completely fits him. He is a character actor than an action star and maybe the fans expect more of him than some cheesy lines and pretending to drive inside a car in a studio. So the cast and plot both are not working in favor of the movie and that's a big letdown.It's still too early to predict if Need for Speed will become a big and a good movie franchise in the future if they make a sequel. But at the moment it drags behind few spots on the top street car race movies of all time.",Need for Speed
82,Spartan_1_1_7,Pleasantly surprised.,7,15 July 2014,"Pleasantly surprised. I expected it to be okayish at best but it turned out to be a thoroughly enjoyable movie. Plus the EPIC! modified Shelby Mustang GT being the main car for most of the movie sure was a treat to watch. That and having races with top exotic cars like Buggati veyron, Koenigsegg agera etc.The story was predictable. After a few minutes or so, I knew what will happen. It's your usual cliché story to move the plot BUT it worked fine here.Aaron paul (Jesse pinkman :p ) plays the protagonist who is the typical car movie hero with amazing driving skills etc. He has a group of friends who are car buffs and this group honestly really made the movie fun, some pretty good funny scenes from them. Really liked the supporting characters. And then there is Imogen poots, the heroin, who I thought looked beautiful and was very lively in the movie minus a few annoyances. Her British accent sure helped a lot. Action scenes were really good, especially considering that there was no CGI at all, no wonder it all looked so REAL. Soundtrack was good too. The movie did had a lot of cheesy dialogues and acting, and the lovey dovey stuff felt unnecessary at times. It also felt like 15-20 min too long. Despite its problems, it is still a fun movie to watch, especially if you are into cars. 7.3/10",Need for Speed

84,domtaylor,The boring plot and terrible acting seemed to make the somewhat good race scenes fall short.,3,18 September 2014,"Being based off of a racing video game, I wasn't expecting Need for speed to have an outstanding plot. What I was expecting was a fun to watch action movie which showcased some amazing looking cars and had some intriguing race scenes. What I got was a movie that had some amazing looking cars... That's it. While the race scenes clearly had some potential, I didn't feel as though I could enjoy them because the terrible plot and acting just took me out of the experience.For a movie with a run time of 2hrs 12mins, not a lot happens and most of what fills up that time is Tobey Marshall (Aaron Paul) and his gang talking about things that we don't even care about. To make it worse, these scenes were carried out with awful acting that was hard to watch. Included in this movie, there are some really weird scenes that just don't fit in. They really didn't know where they were going with this. They tried to make this movie be quite funny, which really didn't work. This movie should have stuck to being an action movie.Overall, I would say that Need for Speed is a waste of a good couple of hours that probably wouldn't even be enjoyed by big racing fans. Need for speed should have just stayed a video game. 3/10",Need for Speed
85,vistheindian,Fasten your seat belts for an adrenaline pumping movie,7,15 March 2014,"Need for Speed, is the latest attempt by Hollywood to adapt a successful video game franchise. The past has shown us that these attempts usually end in failure or mediocrity. While Need for Speed captures the core essence of the video game beautifully, it is by no means a perfect movie.This movie is directed by Scott Waugh, who previously also directed Act of Valor. However, he primarily comes from a stunt work background, following in the footsteps of his father. So you are guaranteed to be delivered high action car chases that are all meticulously and beautifully captured. What makes it all the more impressive is that every chase/race scene are actual stunt work, what you see is what you get. In this day and age where CGI is just slapped on everything for convenience sake, I really respect the director for sticking with practical effects and stunts. It only adds to the adrenaline rush of the scenes.On the other hand, don't expect the same amount of depth to be given to the story or the characters. Aaron Paul plays the part of Tobey Marshall, a car mechanic with a talent for car racing. He is framed for manslaughter by his ex-partner Dino Brewster, played by Dominic Cooper. Now Tobey is on a quest for revenge by winning a race (This is not a spoiler because it is given in the official synopsis and trailers) See this bothers me because I just don't understand how winning a race achieves anything, especially in terms of revenge. If you have been falsely imprisoned for a crime you didn't commit, wouldn't you look for evidence to jail the actual criminal? I just think if the motivation behind the race was better established it would've added more gravity to every chase or race. Aaron Paul, makes his first cinematic appearance since his popular performance in the series Breaking Bad. Still I don't believe this movie gave him or Dominic Cooper the opportunity to show their range. They did a good job for the purpose of this movie but in the end they were very one note characters. I just hope Aaron Paul gets more cinematic opportunities because he deserves the praise. The supporting cast although likable, are at times very campy when trying to be funny. Eventually they grow on you but it is something to be noted. The best of the supporting cast however is Michael Keaton playing Monarch, the mysterious organizer of the race. His character is very charismatic and fills his scene with enthusiasm and passion for the sport.I know I mentioned quite a few negatives, but they were just some opportunities that I thought if exploited would have made for a great movie. Overall I did enjoy watching Need for Speed. This movie does best what it set out to do: to deliver a light, fun movie, filled with action packed, adrenaline pumping races. For that reason alone, I'd recommend checking out this movie.",Need for Speed
86,CowherPowerForever,I Feel the Need..... The Need for Speed,7,23 March 2014,"Based off of the best selling and well received Need for Speed video games comes another video game adaptation. While the story much like the video game counter part is nothing special the visuals are simply amazing. This team making this film decided to go back to those action films of the 1970s where all the car stunts were real. Sadly the stunts and races are the only major bright spots on this film, but these races take up more than enough screen time.As mentioned above the story is nothing special. Bad event takes place, and revenge is the game for the remainder of the film. We have seen it a million times, and it fits in with the video games this film is based on. Acting is middle range at best, which is not really a surprise for a film like this. In my opinion Michael Keaton steals the show. While his on screen time is rather small, he plays a big part in the plot. Aaron Paul of Breaking Bad fame is the lead actor of the film, and while I was very skeptical of him taking on this role surprisingly he does a very good job.Directed by Scott Waugh who recently directed Act of Valor is back for another big screen film. If its one thing this film does right it is the car chase sequences. Filmed with no CG, just the stuntmen and a camera, it makes for one exciting joyride. While most of the other aspects are a letdown, the action in this film is simply amazing, and some of the best I have seen on film in a long time. Going with real shots like they did back in the 1970s car movies was the wise choice here. Top of the line without a doubt.Overall if you are in the mood for a good overall action film with with real stunts and not those fake CG chases, then this is easily the film for you. While the story is below average this film hits home on its stunts and action. Simple as that. If you need more than action then waiting for a rental is the best option for you.",Need for Speed
87,The_moan_of_all_moans,Worth the watch for the race scenes alone.,6,16 March 2014,"When the trailer was released there was a barrage of comparisons, likening it to Fast and the Furious films. And with the fast dream-like cars and cheesy actors, it is easy to see why. One thing that separates the two is Need for Speed's riveting race scenes. The roar of the engines and the untouched purity to the cars ability. There is no CGI, no special effects, just beautifully crafted cars being pushed to their limit and it is very entertaining to watch. The story isn't exactly captivating, but that isn't the selling point of the film. It is the aforementioned that it is.The acting is very cheesy, but it was to be expected. I wasn't that big of a fan of Aaron Paul, even in Breaking Bad, but he plays his part well i suppose. A really good action packed racing film.6.5/10",Need for Speed

The best of the bunch can be described as okay at best, and the worst ones are generally listed among the worst films of all time. Need for Speed certainly doesn't buck the trend, but it's definitely better than the vast majority of its brethren. I'm a big fan of the game series on which this film is based. The plot (a race across the country to clear one's name) is taken straight from The Run, one of the better games in the franchise. It makes for some genuinely cool stunts, some visceral destruction, and the occasional race. But where this movie falls horribly short is the dialogue. This movie has more than its fair share of cringe-worthy lines, which not even the perfectly competent acting can cover up. For those unable to bear the wait for the seventh Fast & Furious movie, this is an okay stopgap, but nothing more.",Need for Speed
90,tecnogaming,Absolutely superb !,8,14 July 2014,"Let me start this review saying that i'm not going to objectively rate this movie based on movie standards.I'm going to rate this movie based on the premise, this is NEED FOR SPEED (The movie) and this is a movie about the game Need for Speed, if you played the game you deserve to rate it, if you didn't, you will just rate a racing movie, without all the rest.Me, I am (and was since kid) a fan of the Need for Speed. The saga started with a software rendering version of the game and then proceed to be accelerated with 3Dfx, a card that was ""THE HIT"" in that period of time and let me tell you that the movie honors the game SO much that it shows the best possible scenarios you can come up with if you played the game, right up to the leaves of trees, the jumps and the feel of the game.The movie director even took it's time to show a big portion of the main racer path that I took to beat a challenge in Forza Horizon (the game on Xbox).The movie is filled with references to the game, it's fast, it shows a lot of cars (much more than Fast & Furious) and shines in the scenes of giving you the feel and thrill of the game while you watch it, something i really didn't consider was gonna happen.I will finish this review by saying that this movie is by far better than the whole Fast & Furious saga, filled with script that was really not necessary.One thing i hated about that saga is how much the writers tried to fill the movie with script about police , street racing and drugs and then the race got into the background, like Walking Dead did for the zombies.Need for Speed put the cars in the front, in fact, you actually get to know the cars and develop a fond for them, something that was not present in any of the other racing movies.The trailer for this movie was actually horrible so the movie was really a surprise. The feel of ""team work"", the importance the movie puts to the actual cars. The main leads are present but are not BIG STARS that cast shadows into the idea that this is basically a racing cars movie. This was for me the big flaw in Fast & Furious, too much emphasis on the actors and the script, and very little on the actual feel of the race and the cars.If you played Need for Speed and love super power cars and racing you absolutely NEED TO SEE this movie.Need for Speed rocks",Need for Speed
91,moviescoundrel,A Lengthy Race,7,25 March 2014,"When I read a synopsis about this movie and saw it had ""revenge"" in the plot, I hoped for the best. I do enjoy when the bad guys get what they deserve. This wasn't a typical revenge movie however. It was a pretty long video game adaptation at over 2 hrs and 15 min. This could have easily been a 90 minute movie, but added plot, depth, and attempted character development added quite a bit of length. And while I appreciate the attempt, it didn't really all add up to an A+. I did enjoy Paul in the lead role for the most part, and appreciated the beginning of the film. There is almost an entire 30 minutes in the beginning that could have been cut, all to show the basic need for revenge, the need for redemption, and the need for speed, but it seems like most of that could have been shown in a 90 second montage. That being said, I like longer movies, and while it was no problem for me, it didn't make the movie necessarily any better. There is cheesy dialogue, there are cheesy racing moments, but also along the way, some suspense, action, humor, and quite entertaining car scenes. I especially appreciated the bit that took place in Michigan and the attempted apprehension by the Michigan State Police by some over the hill officers that could not hang with these professional racers. While not great, the film is not a complete waste, although not necessarily perfect for multiple viewings.",Need for Speed
92,georgecoffeynewyorker,Outstanding,10,12 March 2014,"I went along to a lovely, heartwarming film. I enjoyed it immesnely. Twas a bit sad at times. But more so angry too. As the lead character was let off, with a crime he had committed. The plot simply to the best of my understanding, Aaron's character describes another friend Pete as a ""brother"", who sadly is killed off. The film surrounds itself in Car racing, Drag racing or whatever yee all call it. The black guy dunno either the character or actor's name as Davey Wavey says ""God Damn"". He's such a babe. Loved his tricks. Especially with the helicopter and the car. But one thing that stood out in the film, was SCENERY. Oh god, it was like I was in heaven. Then there were moments when my heart was pumping like mad.",Need for Speed
93,Waedliman,Not satisfying,5,6 February 2021,"This film is a good example of how less is often more. At over 2 hours, it is far too long, and director Scott Waugh leads us along various clichés that reach a negative climax in Michael Keaton's ""Monarch"". Overacting of the highest order and a character that is as superfluous as a goitre. Otherwise, it is already clear after a few minutes where the journey is going and it is told without any surprises. Yes, the racing scenes are exciting, but everything else is rather implausible or clichéd. Let's leave it at that this film is okay for a boring covid evening, but absolutely not for anything more.",Need for Speed
94,brent_or,"Great Car Sequences, Lackluster Script (6.5)",6,14 March 2014,"I was conflicted about how to rate this film. It has its downsides, but where it counts, it does come across pretty well. Ultimately, if you enjoy cars and action-driving footage, Need for Speed is worth it. If not, you aren't missing much by passing it up.There are a couple of comparisons that I think are helpful here. First, this film is like Pacific Rim in that it thrives in the execution of its central premise. Instead of giant robots fighting aliens, here you have footage of real cars (many of them fantastic models) racing, and those sequences are great. Lots of visceral thrills. Unfortunately, the rest of the film (script/non-driving scenes) is nothing to write home about.The second comparison that I'd make is to That Awkward Moment. The parallel there is that Need for Speed also has a great cast of charismatic, engaging young actors having fun, which helps to offset the lackluster script. Imogen Poots is even more charming in this film.What all of that adds up to is that Need for Speed is snappy and fun, and a real treat in its car-driven sequences. Not a terribly good story, but an entertaining film.",Need for Speed
95,bellab1972,You have to be kidding!,2,10 January 2015,"I am astounded anyone gave Need for Speed more than 4 stars and even then it's only because of the beautiful cars! I love cars and car chase movies but am insulted that the majority of these movies don't even attempt any realism or respect for the laws of gravity! Even though this film was based on a game which didn't really have a storyline, there is no excuse to consider film goers as idiots! But, I suppose by some of the reviews, the producers were correct!! The acting, story line, script and production was not only deplorable, it showed little to no effort was made to make this movie enjoyable! All I got from Need for Speed was America does not have any traffic whatsoever and the police are completely incompetent! Oh, and Americans drive like they are 70 year old pensioners who need to be close to the steering wheel and their hands at the 10 and 2 position at all times! I am certain that the good reviews come from 14 year old boys who couldn't care less about production quality or acting skills but love fast cars!

96,JamesIan2021,One Of The Best Films Of 2014,5,2 May 2015,"The most unfairly reviewed movie of 2014 so far, I think critics are being biased now and jumping on the same old band wagon that plagues video game adaptations: They see that they are adaptations and simply assume it will be bad, they love to hate it and I have a nagging feeling critics don't bother paying attention to the whole film. A lot of game adaptations haven't been good but this one is an exception. Need For Speed captures the intensity and thrills of the successful game franchise and adds in a solid revenge story with cool characters, truly amazing stunt work and some of the best chases and racing scenes ever put to film. Aaron Paul plays Tobey Marshall, a street racer who joins a cross country race with revenge on his mind after he was framed by a business associate who places a massive bounty on his head as the race starts. Aaron Paul takes his place as a potential new screen hero, I thought he was tremendous moving on completely from Breaking Bad, there's not an essence of Jesse proving that he has range and he fits the racer type mould. Imogen Poots brings British talent and wit and I loved the chemistry between her and Paul. Kid Cudi's acting debut was actually very good, he's the eyes in the sky for our driving hero and I like his ability to make us laugh even when the action is in full throttle. Dominic Cooper plays his bad guy role with charm and suitable sinister style, never venturing into campy, and Michael Keaton is a blast to watch as he commentates on the racing. I'm not a car junkie but blimey the feeling of going fast and living on the edge was alive in this movie, I want to be behind the wheel of a Mustang, Koenigsegg or Bugatti. You feel like the driver thanks to the bumper cams and Scott Waugh's ability to put you in the driver's seat. The deep throaty engines roar on the surround sound and all this noise and speed create a totally unique and sensational racing experience. The race scenes always start with the rumble of an exotic, tuner, muscle or import car, grumbling exhausts and revs going up and up, your heart is pumping waiting for the gas to be pushed. Even better Need For Speed is in 3D, it made me gasp and I constantly felt close to the action and I never say that as it's rather cliché but seriously you feel like you're in control, behind the wheel of these stunning cars. Bumpers get so close to the screen, helicopters weave in and around the screen with clear spacing and the landscapes truly show the power of depth, alongside truly amazing video quality. This is a bold statement: The racing in Need For Speed excels that of Fast And Furious. I didn't think that would be possible, this is breathless entertainment, adrenaline pumping, jaw dropping, eye watering, roaring spectacle that drives at 230mph and never stops. This is the car movie I've been waiting for, Fast and Furious has some competition.",Need for Speed

98,aldri-feb,Enough speed but running out of fuel,4,13 March 2014,"Need for Speed is a brainless racing car movie that should be missed anyway. Whole of of the movie is about showing off cool car, revenge and car chasing. Perhaps the first racing car scene is quite tense but felt exhausted if it repeated many times in 2 hour length. Plus the storyline is so standard and they use a video game script that makes this movie completely mess.All the casts here including Aaron Paul and Michael Keaton are stuck in this horrible script though they seems have tried their best to save the movie. Overall Need for speed is too noisy, boring and empty-brained that could only be enjoyed by it's fans.",Need for Speed
99,jackbanister16,Fantastic Spectacle,9,22 March 2014,"This movie actually blew me away!Let's all be up front here, We (or at least 90% of us) saw this because of Aaron Paul and the hype he brought from ""Breaking Bad."" I went into the theater expecting a Fast and the Furious clone owed to the fact that the genre has been dominated over the last 15 years by the franchise. I love the Fast and Furious flicks, but this movie crushed the competition as far as the racing/chase scenes go. There was almost no CGI. Yes, I said that right...almost NO Computer Generated Images! The camera angles aren't overly jumpy and actually give us interesting perspectives (Over the shoulder, low angle, and sky view). The camera work, cinematography, and stunt work was very impressive and far more realistic than F&F. Sure, there were a plethora of unrealistic scenarios, but it helped suspend reality by at least LOOKING real. As far as acting, I was surprisingly not impressed with Aaron Paul's performance. After seeing his range in BB, he came off stiff and out of place in this role. He wasn't bad, but I believe a more charismatic performance would have suited the role of ""Toby Marshall,"" better. Then again, the script may have been the reason why Toby seemed to be a wooden character. The real stars of the show: The supporting cast, which was quite charming and quirky; They really added to the story and included the much necessary moments of comic relief to an otherwise intense plot. Speaking of the plot...I liked it. It was a run-of the-mill, revenge plot, but the acting and excellent action sequences helped to make it special. I especially liked the villain, Dino, who I thought was a truly diabolical ""bad guy."" You knew how the movie would pan out five minutes into it, but it was a blast to watch altogether. I recommend you check out this movie. If not for the cars, then do it to support practical effects and stunts in movies; It looks a hell of a lot cooler than CGI. Though this movie doesn't have quite the charisma (Paul Walker comes to mind) of the first couple ""Fast and Furious"" movies the action sequences blow them out of the water. Check this one out for sure!",Need for Speed
100,hazysistersunshine33,Your Need for Speed will be to get as far away from wherever this movie's playing.,3,15 September 2014,"So far this is on my top five lists of worst movies so far of 2014. I am rather discouraged too because I was really looking forward to Aaron Paul's movie screen debut break out roll. He's a race car driver turned auto mechanic whose father dies and Aaron Paul takes over his business. One of his friends gets killed in car accident caused by some rival race car driver turned pro and Aaron Paul gets blamed for it because the other driver left the scene of the accident. Sorry, I know that sounds like a spoiler, but I think most of you will see it coming a mile away. It had to happen to drive (no pun intended) the plot along. Aaron Paul gets sent to prison for a few years for man-slaughter. When he comes out, he is heck bent on getting back at the guy who actually caused his friend to get killed in the accident, by beating him in an illegal Cannon Ball run like race cross country. The plot is so badly thrown together to capitalize on the video game it's based on, it's ridiculous. I am so tired of Hollywood only caring about making money. They don't even care about making a quality product a lot of times. Your Need for Speed will be to get as far away from wherever this movie's playing.",Need for Speed

103,jhigginbotham151,"Need For Speed, the movie based on a driving simulator.",4,21 July 2014,"This was doomed from the beginning.The Need For Speed franchise is huge in gaming, massive in fact, so the idea of a movie adaption is no big surprise. But the fact that the idea was even entertained is hilarious considering the game is just driving, thats it, a fun racing/driving game. You could have slapped any name on this and it wouldn't have made a difference, Need For Speed is just an average, cliché ridden car movie without any of the fun.Aaron Paul is awful. I love him on Breaking Bad but after this I'm beginning to question whether he's as versatile as I thought he was because this performance is just bland, boring and not anywhere near what I wanted to see from him. The rest of the cast are equally stale. Poots is an undeniably beautiful girl and she does brighten up the scenes she's in with her radiancy but he acting leaves a lot to be desired, as much as she does try to be optimistic. Dominic Cooper is cliché bad guy and I practically smelled the paycheck being handed over for the role. Michael Keaton and Kid Cudi (yeah Kid Cudi acts) offer some good comedy relief for their brief screen time but for a film as bland as this its very much appreciated.The plot is a been there, done that deal. Its all standard Hollywood adaptation affair and not worth talking about because you've seen it before. The car stunts where pretty impressive considering it was all done for real with no CGI so props to the effects department for trying practical effects out. The film itself is well shot and scenes that take place in desert terrain are beautiful to look at, but besides that there isn't much else that stood out, the racing scenes are dull and unthrilling and there isn't anything truly over the top ala Fast & Furious to help it. It takes itself far too seriously and grounds itself t much in reality for the audience to have any fun and in the end thats why it fails at being anything it set out to be. Is it a good video game adaption? No. Is it a thrilling car film? No. Is it interesting in anyway shape or form? No.",Need for Speed

105,supatube,Was in need of some Speed.,7,11 March 2014,"When the title is ""Need for Speed"" it's kinda surprising that the pace is slow... like really really slow... It's probably the most painful part of the film, making it more suited for a home viewing just so one is not confined to a cinema seat.The stories predictability didn't serve the slow pace neither. It was rather excruciating to sit through a ten minute scene when the viewer already knew the outcome. The set up was good, until one realises it was merely setting up the set up. And half an hour into the film the story really begins.Being one of the kids who was gripped by the game I was thrilled that they mimicked images from the game and used them in the film with effortless ease. The drifting right from the get go was really awesome and, in my opinion, the biggest hi five to the game.The acting cannot be faulted, in fact each character was, although stereotypical, captivating enough to hold my attention - Imogen Poots being really enjoyable to watch.The racing scenes were good. I know people are raving about it being real stunts over CGI, I however am a movie fan, whatever serves the film, so real stunts and good CGI do the same thing - make it look real. But well worth the watch nonetheless.3D - was a total waste of time. I may have taken the glasses off totaling about thirty minutes.The film boasts one of the most impressive car chases, one I have not seen since ""Bullitt"". I would go as far as to say that ""Need for Speed"" topped it. It definitely tops ""Ronin"" and ""French Connection"" in the car chase department. The film was entertaining enough - I would have preferred a private viewing at home where I wasn't forced to concentrate as diligently as I did, because lets face it, it's still not ""Bullitt"", ""Ronin"" or ""French Connection"" in the story department.6.5/10",Need for Speed
106,thomas-w15,Don't expect a new fast and furious film,4,22 November 2014,"Need For Speed 4/10- I can not think of one movie based off of a video game that I actually liked. This is the first. Aaron Paul , better known as Jesse Pinkman from Breaking Bad, leads a flawed but still exhilarating and impressive racing film. The racing movies have definitely been overused as of late, but Need for Speed is still an enjoyable experience even though it does not really add much to the racing film genre.Now, is this film as good as some of the recent fast and furious films? No, does not even come close, but it definitely ranks higher than the first two films of the fast and furious franchise. The worst parts about the film were probably the parts where it took itself too seriously and try to make you believe that it was the best racing film ever made.Things I would have changed would be certain situations in the movie where it seems like it could never actually happen like a car going airborne and landing perfectly and the car always seems to be fine even if it goes twenty feet in the air at 180 mph. Just stuff that would make it seem in the realm of reality and not like a video game. The best parts still were the driving scenes just because the stunt drivers really made the audience believe that those intense car chases were actually taking place. Aaron Paul was the person who made you feel like the movie was worth watching. He by far gave the best performance in Need for Speed playing the driving dare devil Toby Marshall. The rest of the cast did their part but they did not really impact the movie in anyway. Aaron Paul is really the only one worth mentioning walking out of the movie and only a few other actors probably could have done as good of a job as he did.This movie is not a must-see film, but if you are bored one day and want to see a decent action movie, Need For Speed won't disappoint.For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com",Need for Speed

109,born_naughty,I liked the quirkiness but not for everyone,8,3 May 2014,"Let me start by saying this movie has nothing to do with the video game besides the obvious.I gave it an 8 mainly because of 1 reason. I'm getting tired of all these CGI filled movies. In most cases, more CGI is less, it's makes the movie less. Need for speed barely had any CGI that I could tell and I could feel it. The races and stunts really made it a lot more exciting this way.I believe a lot of people are not going to like this movie. The movie starts on a very serious, realistic and dramatic note. It doesn't really work well and I feared it was gonna get boring real quick. The actor's are decent but nothing more. The characters are good but the plot holes don't exactly help. So I was really happy when the movie started to get less serious after about 25-30 minutes (guessing here) in. The plot holes started piling up but at the same time the jokes started to get better and the action/car chases started to get better.So in the end it seemed like the movie never knew if it was supposed to be a drama or a lighthearted action movie. It reminded me of the Yakuza video-games where a very realistic and dramatic storyline with very ""real"" feeling characters cross with craziness I can't even begin to explain to you. Just as it worked for me in the video-games, it worked for me here. But it will definitely NOT please everyone. If you can turn your brain of and not let the unbalanced set you of, I believe you'll enjoy it as much as I did.",Need for Speed
110,Allen_The-Shep_Shepherd,Need for Speed Review,6,12 April 2014,"My Thoughts: Okay I didn't know what to expect with this movie when I first heard about it. I knew it was based off the video game of the same name. I for one have never played the game though I do have friends that enjoy it. I am also not a die hard gear head either. Now that doesn't mean I don't like a nice looking car. But back to the movie.To me if you are going into this expecting to see a racing movie you will be disappointed. You get a totally of two races one at the beginning with old school cars and one at the end with high end cars and that is it. So what do you get between those two races, what you get is some revenge storyline.Let me see if I can summarize it better for you, Tobey Marshall (Aaron Paul) is a small town man that is a really great race drive but isn't going anywhere. Dino Brewster (Dominic Cooper) is also a good racer but comes from the other side of the tracks and has the family means to play in the big league. But Dino is always compared to Tobey and even though he is in the pros everyone believes that Tobey is the better driver. Of course Dino doesn't like this and through some maneuvering he is able to pin the death of Tobey's friend Peter on Tobey. After serving his two years for manslaughter Tobey is released from prison and within a matter of hours is able to get a hold of a one of the kind car and information on very secret underground race sponsored by Monarch (Michael Keaton). Dino who is in the race hears that Tobey is on his way to the race and sets a bounty on his head.So between the two races that I mentioned you pretty much get a road trip from New York to California with a little head hunting and over the top car maneuvers just to have something to look at besides the countryside.Don't get me wrong though this movie does have its moments. Be it from director Scott Waugh's insistence that all the stunts be done practical vice digital adds some great elements to the movie to all the great cars you get to see. And there is some great comedic moments in the movie, I for one have always been a big fan of Rami Malek and he has some great scenes in this movie especially when he quits his job.My Recommendation: If you are looking for a popcorn film to enjoy on a lazy afternoon then this is going to be a good movie for you. But if you are a Need for Speed fan and expecting race after race you might want to pass on this one and wait till it comes to DVD.",Need for Speed
111,CrisMovieCorner,A thoroughly enjoyable Action flick!,7,15 July 2014,"Firstly let me start with a word of warning to some of the idiots out there that have been judging this movie on its acting and or script, this movie is purely a ""popcorn movie"" you just sit your butt down and enjoy! Back to the review.The movie is helmed by former stuntman Scott Waugh who most recently directed ""Act Of Valor"" which in itself was pretty poorly acted and written but had some genuinely beautiful Action scenes. As all you guys/girls will know the movie is based on the Need For Speed video game franchise of which I recently found out is the most successful racing series of all time.The movie starts pretty early on with our main protagonist Tobey Marshall (Aaron Paul) being arrested and falsely convicted of the killing of his friend during an illegal street race, while the real murderer Dino Brewster (Dominic Cooper) is off free to live his life after what seems like orchestrating the whole sick plan.After being released from prison, Tobey is out to seek revenge on the man who killed his friend. This comes in a cross country street race which is organised by a very secretive ex racer Monarch (Michael Keaton), Tobey is joined on his cross country escapade by Julia (Imogen Poots). The girl who organised the sale of the car that Tobey worked on for Dino.""Need For Speed"" may fall short in the acting category well besides Aaron Paul who is as good as ever and in the character development aspect, the movie sure as heck got the action scenes completely spot on! There is some scenes that will make your jaw draw in pure awe that they actually did it. While the script is a bit hit and miss with very clichéd scenes and over used elements we've seen in countless movies before, however that is not to say that the plot is followable all be it flawed at times.Overall, the Action sequences and the stunt driving are phenomenal and thoroughly enjoyable to watch, but the plot and character development leave a bit to be desired. However that being said, going into this movie expecting the plot you get or the character development you get in say ""The Godfather"" then you are really in the wrong ball park. This movie is purely and adrenaline ride, if you like fast and beautiful cars, incredible Action sequences and the police chases that look like they were taken from a video game this IS for you!",Need for Speed

This is just stupid.The story is also very poor, cheap, and predictable. may be suited for next version of the game. Not for big screen.

I liked the first three and the fifth Fast and Furious movies, so I'm not a hater of the genre, but this film . . .I have never seen so much irresponsible, stupid, idiotic and moronic decisions made by so many characters. The main character and supposed hero of the story, Tobey Marshall, is the most reckless, idiotic, brain-dead human being I have ever seen on celluloid. And the fact he is the hero of the story says something. The amount of innocent people this person put in danger with his stupid decisions made Dino (the bad guy) look like a saint in comparison, and the whole movie I hoped Tobey would either get arrested or crash his car so no one else could be put in danger by his stupidity. There is no logic to any of the decisions he makes. The whole gang of protagonists are basically criminals with zero to below zero intelligence, who make one bad, irresponsible, illogical and non-heroic maneuver after another.I don't know if this is what the film makers were going for, to show what big egg-heads people who drive like this are, but they succeeded on every level of convincing me the world has gone mad, and that immoral behaviour that puts lives at risk for . . . for what? For some secret illegal race? To prove who's the better driver? To prove who's the bigger man? To win 2.7 million dollars when the cash is spread out enough to make ends meet for a long time? ""What?"" I kept asking myself. ""What the hell are these meat-heads doing?"" I've never seen Aaron Paul in anything else, so I don't know what type of actor he is, but he managed to pull of the ""Brain-dead, talks in the longest drawl possible, stupid-faced, Pinky/Brain Hybrid, Doh"" character I have ever seen.

118,BrentHankins,"Silly and predictable, but plenty of fun.",7,12 March 2014,"Ever since the popularity of video games skyrocketed in the 1980s, Hollywood has been trying to cash in on the craze by bringing well-known franchises to the big screen. While some adaptations have come close to getting it right (Silent Hill is probably the best), most video games movies have been absolutely terrible, with Super Mario Bros. and Street Fighter: The Movie serving as a shining example of what not to do.With a well-documented history of failed projects, the expectations surrounding Need for Speed couldn't be much lower - after all, it's based on a decades-old franchise about illegal street racing, featuring a young cast that remains unproven at the box office - but what the film lacks in storytelling and character development is more than compensated for, thanks to the action behind the wheel.Two years after being framed for the death of a friend, Tobey Marshall (Aaron Paul) is released from prison with revenge on his mind. His target is Dino Brewster (Dominic Cooper), the shady professional racer that put Tobey in jail and Tobey's friend in a coffin. Taking down Dino will mean beating him at his own game, a top-secret race featuring the world's most elite drivers, and hosted by the mysterious Monarch (Michael Keaton).With less than two days to get from New York to California before the race begins, Tobey embarks on a cross-country trek that features plenty of jaw-dropping moments, made even more thrilling by director Scott Waugh's insistence that all driving stunts be performed by real drivers in real cars. This adds an extra layer of tension that's sorely missing from the Fast and Furious series (to which Need for Speed is destined to be compared), and the film's best moments come courtesy of E-brake drifts, squealing tires, and near collisions.Despite its paper-thin plot and many, many failed attempts at humor, Need for Speed still works thanks to the generous amount of high-octane action sequences, and the undeniable charisma of Aaron Paul. Skeptics may not have believed that Paul could distance himself from his Jesse Pinkman persona, but he delivers a strong performance that should put him on the radar for future action roles.Need for Speed is one of the better attempts at translating a popular video game into a big screen experience, with the practical stunts and real-world action serving as a nice counterbalance to Fast and Furious's ever-increasing ridiculousness. Its silliness, predictability and over- inflated running time keep it from being a truly great movie, but it's still a hell of a lot of fun.-- Brent Hankins, www.nerdrep.com",Need for Speed
119,stemelia21,Its actually pretty good... but,7,24 December 2020,"This film really annoys me because its actually quite good. The cars are amazing, the racing scenes are also very good, the scenes / locations that are in this film are awesome too. The story plot is even ok, its just the final race that spoils it all.The whole point of the final race is the winner takes all the cars hence millions of dollars, but all of the cars get destroyed so it kind of renders it pointless.Other than that its really good and is well worth a watch. 7 /10 is a fair rating.",Need for Speed

But then I realized, it never promised big biceps of Dwayne Johnson or Vin Diesel, big guns, explosions. Watch The film with an open mind and you won't hate it at least.Story and cinematography is amazing. Excellent selection of locations, felt like generated by a very powerful gaming engine. Beautiful musical score. Racing scenes could have been better. Story is better than a lot of high profile action movies'. Acting is average, above and below. Michael Keaton was annoying. Aaron Paul didn't fit with the his character in the first part of the movie. Imogen Poots was the best performer for me.I've seen better ratings in worse movies. So forget about the ratings.

121,briand6465,Buckle-Up!,9,17 March 2014,"Saw Touchstone Pictures, DreamWorks Studios, and Reliance Entertainment ""Need For Speed"" starring Aaron Paul, Dominic Cooper, Imogen Poots, Kid Cudi, and Michael Keaton last night at AMC Theatres which was fast-paced and action-packed; so if you plan on going to see it, Buckle-Up! The film was basically based around the main character ""Tobey Marshall"" played by Paul, a blue collar car mechanic and former race car driver from Mount Kisco, New York who owns a car fixer-up shop, likes street racing after hours, and is framed by ""Dino Brewster"" played by Cooper for a federal crime he didn't commit, after fixing-up a Ford Mustang Shelby for him which was auctioned off to Englishwoman ""Julia Maddon,"" a savvy exotic car dealer who connects the wealthy with high-end super-fast cars played by Poots for $2.7 Million after ""Marshall"" agrees to get the car to go 230+MPH! ""Tobey Marshall"" is sent to jail for involuntary manslaughter after a fatal racing accident involving ""Little Pete,"" one of his crew members played by Harrison Gilbertson, as there is no evidence pointing to involvement by ""Dino"" even though he challenged them both to the race involving illegal imported Koenigsegg Agera cars and was the bad guy to begin with. ""Marshall"" and ""Maddon,"" race across the country in the fixed-up Shelby Mustang to register for ""De Leon,"" a winner-take-all race set-up by ""Monarch"" played by Keaton and when the Mustang is destroyed by ""Dino's"" cronies, ""Marshall"" is given access to the Koenigsegg Automobile which ""Dino"" caused ""Little Pete"" to crash and burn in by ""Anita"" who ""Marshall"" was in love with at one time, played by Dakota Johnson along with her engagement ring given to her by ""Dino."" The idea behind ""Marshall"" participating in the race was for him to return ""Anita's"" ring to ""Dino,"" ultimately attempt to beat him for redemption from the deadly intentional accident which cost ""Marshall's"" crew member ""Little Pete"" his life and clear his name from any wrong doing. Scott Mescudi was the eye in the sky during this crazy cross-country race against time in order for ""Marshall"" to be present for the race in San Francisco, California without being caught by cops for violating his parole. I loved how ""Kid Kudi"" nicknamed himself ""Maverick"" like me! Kudi really added flavor and comedy to the film for sure! I give the film a cinema rating of 9/10! Director Scott Waugh and Producers John Gatins, Patrick O'Brien, and Mark Sourian did an overall great job on this project!

122,Incendid,American Roadtrip 101,6,15 March 2014,"Need for Speed, the movie i have been waiting to see since Breaking Bad finished. I have to say i wasn't expecting too much from this movie and this was due to the fledgling video-game-movie franchise. Need for Speed surprised me, as i am not a huge fan of the Fast and Furious franchise i enjoyed Need for Speed more, the story was good, acting was great, the chemistry between Imogen and Aaron was well captured, the CGI was kept to a minimum and looked great when it was used. But obviously the driving is important in this movie and it was awesome, the races, the crazy driving in small spaces and chase scenes were all awesome. There were a few funny scenes but not too many that they overload the movie and drag it down, just a few to keep the movie entertaining. Overall i felt the movie was over-hyped a little too much, and although the movie was good i hope there are no plans for a sequel. 7/10Jacob: Video Game adaptations have never been smooth in the past years. While this movie is exceptional on a stunt and practicality level, it does suffer from having a similar vibe to the Fast and Furious movies. Revenge plots, angry drivers, road races and all those other various plot points make it into this ludicrous plot. It is entertaining from a dumbed down mindless entertainment level but you won't get anything too original. The actors do a decent job, especially Aaron Paul, with the material given. It is often was too crazy by having cars flying and flipping all over the place especially if they smash into a wall. Fun and dumb 6/10.",Need for Speed

124,oscarxp25,The Need for a Brain,5,30 March 2014,"Some of us waited for this film to see if Hollywood would botch another beloved video game franchise, while others awaited to see the first leading man role for Mr. Jesse Pinkman himself, aka Aaron Paul. While Paul does seem like he will be around for a while, he better have a better gift of picking his projects in the future. ""Need for Speed"" isn't something you would expect a two time Emmy winner to star in his post-glory days.Long story short, the film is incredibly dumb. The film's witlessness is quite distracting at times through the story, character actions, and the atrocious script. The fact that this is based on a video game is no excuse; they weren't even trying here. Tobey Marshall, played by Paul, and his four idiotic friends, Maverick, Joe Peck, Finn, and Little Pete, own a car shop that means everything to them. Toby is a great racer that never took off like his bitter rival Dino Brewster. Brewster has it all. He has the racing career but what stings the most to Tobey is that Brewster took his old girlfriend, Anita. Dakota Johnson, sporting the brunette hair color that she will have for next year's ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is utterly forgettable here. When Tobey and Brewster challenge each other to a race the results are tragic. Tobey gets framed for the tragedy as Brewster speeds away. A few years later, Tobey is let out of jail and his plan for revenge is put into motion. He has forty-eight hours to get from New York to the west coast to participate in a racing event that Brewster will be in. Since this is a big car commercial for Ford, he jumps into the Shelby Mustang, that him and his friends worked on before things went south, and heads out west.Imogen Poots, who plays Julia Maddon, who was is interested in buying the vehicle joins our hero. Her reasoning is strictly business, making sure the car remains intact, but she falls for the mysterious bad boy. Julia is not a typical race movie vixen. She is quite grounded in look and attitude but those two factors make her not only attractive, but more interesting than any girl who has been in the majority of these films. Paul and Poots possess a great and playful chemistry that I look forward to seeing in their upcoming project ""Along Way Down"".There other costars I can't be so kind too. I haven't seen such dully written characters in a very long time. Each of them are walking stereotypes to caricatures of annoyance, brashness, and loudness. This doesn't help Paul or Poots when they are interact with them in the film. Tobey and Julia are pretty normal characters and having them mix with the three other over the top characters throws off the balance of any of the select scenes. The main problem why these three guys suck is the script is absolutely terrible. There was one scene where one of Finn strips down naked and walks out of his job. It could have worked in a better film, but here is just seems really out of place and trying too hard to be funny. There are many scenarios like that that make you roll your eyes in the 120 minutes this thing runs. Many of the lines also are so laughably bad that you can't fathom that someone actually thought them up and confidently put them to paper The film also pushes the aspect of believability, even for a dumbed down action picture like this. Maverick constantly gains excess to airborne transportation as if he is taking his bicycle out for a spin. All the while constantly reminding us how cool he is in a very annoying fashion. One scene quickly shows him sneaking around a base as he steals a helicopter. Really, is that all it takes to get past security? Scott Mescudi, who plays Maverick, is written down to a loud supporting black guy character. None of what he was saying was funny or wise. It just came off as incredibly childish. One of my favorite absurd moments, in the bunch, is when the prisoners are watching the final race on a I-Pad that the officer in charge is holding. It is just too much of a stretch of the truth to buy into.The scenes of destruction are quite nicely done. Scott Waugh, the director, gives the film realism that many present projects have lost. Many shots are done in the back seat of the car looking over the shoulder of the driver. It gives a nice weight to the speed these cars are supposed to be traveling. The car crashes seemed very real. The technical aspects of the film are very well done. Once the film picks up speed, during the races, you see the choices of Waugh come alive. Waugh, who directed the 2012 Navy Seal film ""Act of Valor"", used realism in the combat quite well. He has a gift in grounding action sequences that fellow directors drench in CGI. Though just like ""Act of Valor"", he is tone deaf when it comes to everything between his shining moments: the script and acting stand out the most in both films.Finally, Aaron Paul. As I just stated, through this review, he has very little to work with but does make it work. He brings the same flawed man quality he brought to Pinkman. If he steers himself in the right direction I can see him becoming a decent film actor whose roles would require him to utilize what he does best, which is being a flawed antihero with a strong moral core. Someone who may not be the fastest, tallest, or smartest but has the will to come out on top. The only thing that will stop him is bland, dumb, and forgettable films like these.",Need for Speed
125,Mike-Bear,First movie that based on a game and I like it!,8,1 March 2015,"I seen a trailer of the ""Need for Speed"" when I have been in cinema on the movie ""RUSH"". Trailer was very impressive and intriguing. However because of my disappointment about movies that based on a games, I consider to not watch this movie. Eventually in cold January evening I make a decision to watch this movie. I was so surprised from the first minutes of the movie. I can not even imagine that exactly ""Need for Speed"" will be movie that will be appropriate, close to the game and enjoyable as a movie that based on a game. Thank you very much Scott Waugh for this impressive, tremendous and amazing movie that based on one of the most famous game. I think this conception to put in one movie different kind of things that a little bit of related to each other, makes ""Need for Speed"" exactly appropriate according to perspectives of the gamers who likes the game ""Need for Speed"". I'm talking about participation Carroll Shelby as an engineer and his greatest creation Ford Mustang Shelby GT, small city Mount Kisco and countryside guys who have small car service and of corse connection with racing on open wheels cars. I think exactly this details makes this movie so spectacular.P. S: People who expect something high intellectual or with original ideas, might be not really understand what is mean ""Need for Speed"" as a game. If you disappointed after watching this movie, it is maybe because of you did not play in this game or may be misunderstood something.P.

Everyone, including people who knows Pete and others who never met him or probably met him once says this dialogue! Come on, Pete is a kid mechanic, he's not a world-class racing car driver or the most important person on earth that everyone keeps chanting his name. I get it that Tobey and his friends keep saying it which makes sense, but the British babe who probably met him once and the De Leon presenter who probably never heard of him keeps saying this sounds a bit ridiculous! Pete, great going mate, you have been immortalised by everyone in the NFS universe!Besides this small niggle, this is an awesome film. I can't imagine the number of times I watched the police-chase scene or the office strip-tease scene! The office scene is pure ingenious. I fell in love with Mustang after seeing this film and might even consider getting one. There are ridiculous, over-the-top action scenes but what did you expect? This is a fun, logic-defying film made out of a hugely successful video game franchise. Acting wise, Aaron Paul was spot on. He underplayed his role with super cool attitude and it totally works. His gang of friends are equally impressive with a special mention to Rami Malek for the impressive office strip scene. And then, Imogen Poots with her super-cute British Accent was a delight to watch. (I loved the way she says ""Oh! For my mug shot"" just before the police chase scene!)So, a totally fun move and I recommend it if you are a fan of this genre.

The film has a fairly predictable vengeance plot, yet it is well-structured and has enough entertaining twist to keep the audience engaged at all times, while also offering the occasional addition of humor which feels favorable to the overall tone and pace. Considering the fact that there is little computer generated imagery involved the film's design is very impressive, as all the racing sequences are well-crafted and prove electrifying, with some of the camera-work also being praiseworthy.

I mean that Need for Speed games are not centered in a storyline, they are centered on cars, tuning, speed , cars chases and all these stuff. History doesn't matter in films like this one.

136,Sahl_95,An Alright Movie.,8,13 March 2014,"The story is about Tobey Marshall (Aaron Paul) as a street racing mechanic who has his mind set on getting revenge on Dino Brewster (Dominic Cooper) for framing him for a death in a street race.The first parts of the movie show Tobey racing to earn money for his struggling car repair shop. Although the race brought back memories of my childhood, it did feel a bit long at times and not as exciting as it should have done. After the race, Dino gives Tobey a job opportunity which needs him to fix up a Mustang which would also help save his business. The events soon after the job lead to an awesome race with three Koenigsegg Ageras and the frame up. The middle part of the movie is mainly about gaining access to the DeLeon (an illegal high stakes street race where the winner takes all) so that he can try and get his revenge against Dino. However, he first needs a car and he is reunited with the Mustang that he built. The return of the Mustang also brings back Julia Maddon (Imogen Poots) who bought the car for a wealthy man and accompanies Tobey to the DeLeon. This leads to a long (but exciting) road trip to gain.During this trip there are some awesome stunts and chases.The final part of the movie is the big race, the DeLeon. This race was definitely my favourite part of the movie since it brought back many memories of the game: the exotic cars; the cop chases; and racing through some great scenery. Watching cars (even though they are replicas) like the Bugatti Veyron, the McLaren P1, the Lamborghini Sesto Elemento and the Koenigsegg Agera race was just awesome. The race itself was also very entertaining (although predictable) and the ending was satisfying.However, there are a lot of conveniences and ridiculous scenarios and escapes. A lot of disbelief needs to be suspended for this movie. You can easily guess what happens next and for the most part, you can guess how it happens. There probably won't be anything that will surprise you. The plot will happen exactly as you would expect for a movie like this.Aaron Paul was great as Tobey Marshall. The rest of his gang are not bad, but not great either. His gang provide a lot of the comic relief in the movie. Imogen Poots and Dominic Cooper were both decent in their roles as well. Michael Keaton as the commentator of the DeLeon was also decent.In the end, I did enjoy this movie despite all of the conveniences. Most of the races were awesome to watch, the stunts were awesome, and I loved the final race. Did see it in 3D, wouldn't say it was essential for this movie.",Need for Speed
137,edgereviews,Need for Speed Review,7,14 March 2014,"Let's face it; Need For Speed isn't really a video game adaptation, or at least I never saw it as one. A Need For Speed movie could take any direction it wanted to, it just needs to feature fancy cars and some cool races. It's not comparable to the games, so I don't consider it a video game adaptation, as all it does is take the name of the series. This name obviously gives the movie the boost it needs to help it compete against the 'Fast & Furious' movies, so how does it compare with them? Although better than 'Fast & Furious' 1 – 4, Need For Speed suffers from some serious script problems, and is only elevated by its excellent car sequences and great cast.Do you want to see a movie with some character development? Don't watch this movie. The characters in Need For Speed are pretty pathetic, they're not very interesting and are very bland, boring and generic. The only motive of the main character seems to be revenge, and we really learn nothing about him as a person and he only receives a small bit of back story at the very beginning of the film. Other characters are uninteresting as well, most of them only serve to either help the main character or stop him. The plot, although not terrible, is fairly disbelievable, and there was much more build up to the final race than what I expected.Although the characters in Need For Speed suck, the actors clearly do the best they can with their material. This was Aaron Paul's first big movie after 'Breaking Bad', so this is his opportunity to prove he has movie star capabilities. He certainly does, as he absolutely dominates the screen, managing to make a bad character enjoyable to watch. Imogen Poots is also excellent, and so is Michael Keaton. Surprisingly, Scott Mescudi (also known as Kid Cudi) is actually pretty good in his first major role. Granted, his character isn't exactly complex at all, but he does a good job with his material. Dominic Cooper, Rami Malek and Ramon Rodriguez are all good as well.Need For Speed's strongest suit is obviously its excellent driving sequences. They're thrilling and heart pounding, and the lack of CGI really does the film justice as it makes all of the stunts much more impressive. The film could probably be slightly shorter, but I still had fun throughout it all so it doesn't really matter. Scott Waugh does a great job with directing, the cinematography is outstanding as well. It's just a shame that the writing isn't as good as the action is. I would still recommend Need For Speed, but like many other releases this month it's just silly action with no real substance.",Need for Speed

Aaron, M Keaton, Rami, Dominic, Ramon did it for me, Imogen, Dakota, Harrison, Scott (he was so irritating - African-Americans should protest the stereotyping) did not. Couldn't understand how Imogen's character went from savvy biz to dreamy ditz.Elements of the game like the build-up to the final race, police car chases, attempted roadblock (the police car-pile driver was really a low-point), helicopter surveillance, etc were featured.The movie was engrossing and I didn't feel the length of the two hours. However, some major plot holes/ inconsistencies didn't work for me... but hey, its based on a video game. I appreciate the director for not resorting to the F&F style of direction.Watch it if you like cars, chases and/or Aaron...

143,isaackiernan,Incomprehensible Mess,3,16 March 2014,"I....really wanted to like this. When I first heard about a NFS movie I was like....you mean that game where it's all cars and no characters? and it's just racing? But then I heard Aaron ""Jesse Pinkman"" Paul was signed on to star and I got pumped. I was hyped after the first trailer. What I thought the movie would be- based on early promotional material - was a brutal revenge flick with lots of speed and action. In my head I envisioned a cast of crazy characters all racing cross country in some form of ""Wacky Races"" scenario. I thought of bizarre homemade cars with machine guns in the headlights and knives in the hubcaps. Well I went to see it last night. Paid for two tickets. $21.00. well.... This is the second movie I ever saw where I genuinely wanted my ticket fare back. The first forty minutes or so were completely 100% pointless. The dialogue was just awful, some of the worst I've ever heard. Paul's performance is so bland he blends into the background. I've never seen him so subdued. He's such an energetic actor, even in smaller roles! There is no clear date and time associated with the story. It seems to be modern day, until some form of holographic teleportation device shows up, as well as holographic speedometer displays-- leading one to believe this is some form of sci-fi future? Also this movie is full of scenes that lead nowhere, conversations that mean nothing, and motivations that are unrealistic at best. The movie's biggest sin is it's inconsistency. It has moments that almost work, and in any other movie would, but because of all of the problems the truly decent moments just don't make it worth watching. This film should've clocked in at about 85 minutes. at 130 minutes it is a chore to watch, and the cringe inducing ""comedic relief"" characters are grating and outstay their welcome. The only decent performance in the film is Michael Keaton playing THE MONARCH!!!! (Where was Dr. Mrs.?) He is basically playing Betelguese if he was a radio DJ, and provides some of the few enjoyable scenes in this rotten flick. Aaron, I love you buddy, but you should've passed on this turkey. 3 ricin cigs out of 10.",Need for Speed
144,didonatope,A Bumpy but Fun Ride,7,14 March 2014,"While this movie certainly does have its flaws, it is far from the disaster it could have been. I dare even to say that with the delay of the next Fast and Furious movie, this is a pretty decent holdover for vehicle-based action fans.""Need for Speed"" tells the story of a driver and mechanic named Tobey Marshall (played by Aaron Paul of ""Breaking Bad""). Marshall seeks to avenge the death of his brother by defeating his slaughterer, millionaire car-enthusiast Dino Brewster (played by Dominic Cooper of ""Captain America: The First Avenger""). Not wanting to be bested, Brewster places a bounty on him, and it is up to Marshall to get to the race before Dino's goons kill him.Let me start out by saying that I have not played any of the ""Need for Speed"" video games, even as a kid. I'm personally more of a fan of the Midnight Club games. Nevertheless, I'm at least sure that fans of racing games in general will love the set-pieces in this movie. Many of the vehicle stunts use real cars, and the near-flawless cinematography fits the high-octane race scenes perfectly. Viewers will certainly be on the edge of their seats with every crash and tight turn. The cars themselves are also pleasing to look at. From Ferraris to Lamborghinis to Mustangs, every vehicle is sleek and a pleasure to watch race on the track.The race and chase scenes themselves are were this movie really shines. With every set piece come the sounds of revving engines and screeching tires, set perfectly to fine camera work and editing to give a truly exciting experience. While I am not one to complain about the use of CGI, the lack of it in the film's production gave a much more believable look to the crashes and races, especially when the film cuts to go-pro- filmed footage of the airborne vehicle. To me, the use of the go-pro gave me the same exciting, immersive feeling that I felt while watching the barrel scene in ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug."" When used well, I can honestly encourage filmmakers to use the go-pro camera to filmA common criticism of the plot is that it is completely ridiculous and not in any way plausible in the real world. While this is certainly true, I feel that in an action/eye-candy oriented film like this, that it is best to leave your complaint notebook at the door and immerse yourself in the film's world. When the suspension of disbelief is applied the story itself is not half bad. ""Need for Speed's"" story was conceived by Academy-Award nominated screenwriter John Gatins and his brother George. Without giving anything away, the plot provides plenty of interesting events to keep the story moving and even bothers to throw in some character development. It's far from an all-out character study like ""Her,"" but there are still a decent amount of scenes that bother to get the audience to care about the characters. Each character is given a decent amount of screen time, and I actually walked out remembering some of the characters. From the brooding but sincere Tobey Marshall to the comic relief of his friend Benny (played by musician Scott Mescudi –a.k.a. Kid Cudi), I felt that the fleshed out characters really added some meat to the action.Though the story and characters themselves are not too shabby, I had a lukewarm opinion on the screenplay. Unfortunately, John Gatins only helped conceive the story. His brother George wrote the screenplay by himself, and his results are mixed. In films like ""Fast and Furious 6"" and ""Iron Man 3,"" the screenplay is well balanced with good humor and light drama to blend well with the fun factor. Here is a different story; the film's tone will often switch from humorous antics (one such scene involving streaking at an office) to borderline-melodramatic scenes (such as one hospital scene). It is quite jarring and it feels as if Mr. Gatins was trying to take the film more seriously than it should have been taken.Another thing I have to say is that this film felt a tad too long. Clocking in at over two hours, ""Need for Speed"" does contain some scenes that feel like they could have been cut and are there just for filler. While I did admire the development of the characters, some of the dialogue simply repeats what was already stated, leaving me to say ""OK, I get it"" a few times in my mind. Perhaps if the film was trimmed about 10-20 minutes short, then it would have been much smoother to suit the sleek action sequences.This film is far from perfect, though to be honest, I was honestly entertained by it. While it's impossible to deny that Hollywood has had a bad reputation adapting video games into movies, this was honestly a pretty good attempt. It's not the saving grace of video game adaptations, but in my mind it is absolutely a step up from busts like ""Resident Evil: Retribution"" and ""Silent Hill: Revelation."" If you love thrilling races and colorful cars, I can almost guarantee that you'll be entertained.",Need for Speed

Moreover, the movie fascinated me as besides the above mentioned there were also pictured love, love to the family, love to the brother and to the racing. Since now, I have watched this film a couple times and it still is pretty good to watch and I will surely watch it in the future. The only reason is that I did not give it 10 starts is the following. As the movie is strongly linked to the video game it lacked the character development. In my opinion this is the only bad side of the whole movie. Although the characters are good, the actors are well chosen and play is good, they are not not fully developed, which as it was said, is understandable as its based on a video game. so to sum up this film is for people who like fast and beautiful cars, crazy stunts and cars chases, who enjoy getting chased by the cops in the video game and who like the presence of a bit of emotion in the action movie.",Need for Speed

Completely the wrong tone for the Need For Speed game franchise aimed at a PG audience when it should of been more adult orientated. Some good car action though but it doesn't make up for a limp overall story. What should have been a no holds barred tale of revenge turns into a limp Smokey and The Bandit yarn. In terms of the cast; Michael Keaton is given a strange role a some kind of commentating race guru. Paul is backed up by the youngest car crew you're ever likely to see.

The Fast and Furious syndrome, which I have seen in all other street race movies,further made me wince as I started watching this movie.I was pleasantly surprised. Aaron Paul has some good screen presence, and his 'sidekicks' bring a lot into the game. The brit lady is incredibly smooth in her interactions with Aaron, and the villain is believable and scum enough for us to not care that he loses the final bout. As most race car movies are, it is predictable when it actually comes to how it ends, but it has enough twists and turns that it has you guessing more than you'd think.The races are realistic, and exciting, the cop chases a bit less realistic but with the commentary of both the Monarch and Aaron's sidekicks it makes it fun to watch.

You will see more of her, guaranteed.Third, and at a deeper level, the story is a metaphor, what all meaningful stories strive for. It is about taking risks and expanding the boundaries that bind us.

163,TyRawrrnosaurus,Fails to Deliver Anything of Value Past the Promise of Real Stunts,4,10 March 2014,"Despite the game franchise not having a set story mode until 2003 with Need for Speed: Underground, screenwriter George Gatins took it upon himself to create an original narrative without having to lean on preexisting material. Need for Speed follows Tobey Marshall (Aaron Paul), a run-of-the-mill, auto mechanic nice guy with a knack for illegal street racing – daddy issues are assumed, but no real back story is defined. He uses his race winnings to pay off debts accumulated by his shop because apparently no one wants to have their car tuned up by the best racer in town.Like all video game protagonists, Tobey has a rival, Dino Brewster (Dominic Cooper), a spoiled rich boy sociopath who must win at all costs – he also has the Tobester's ex-girlfriend Anita (Dakota Johnson) wrapped around his fingers to establish top tier bad guy status. She proves to be a worthless character anyways until one significant plot convenience and Cooper struggles to grow Dino beyond the stereotypical villain role, lacking any dimension and zero charisma.Dino strolls into town one day looking to hire Tobey to build a Mustang. They eventually end up racing each other so Dino can prove his mega star status isn't a fluke. This of course entices Tobey's wide-eyed, ADHD BFF Little Pete (Harrison Gilbertons) to want to get in on the action, which you know won't end well. Doing what any rival would do in the face of near defeat, Dino knocks into Little Pete's car causing it to burst into flames mid-air. Racing away from the scene of the crime, Dino leaves Tobey behind who is picked up by the cops and held accountable for the unintentional murder of his friend.Released on parole two years later, Tobey seeks revenge, recruiting his ragtag group of friends – Joe (Ramón Rodriguez), Benny (Scott Mescudi aka Kid Cudi), and Finn (Rami Malek), a colorful bunch who provide comedic relief and come in handy when the story requires them to be – as well as a cheeky-British gal with a wealth of car knowledge named Julia Maddon (Imogen Poots), whom he helped build the Mustang for. Poots is the most lively of the cast, creating great chemistry with Paul as they bounce off each other very well. You definitely feel their camaraderie build as the two get to know each other while they are chased by the cops or flee from other drivers because Dino issues a bounty to stop Tobey from reaching Dino.Together they all must drive across the country to San Francicso in two days time in hopes they can gain the attention of Monarch (Michael Keaton), the organizer of the most illustrious, invitation only underground street racing competition, the DeLeon. Tobey believes that if he qualifies for the DeLeon and wins he will somehow prove his innocence to the world – if that makes any sense at all. Keaton chews up every scene with absolute flair and a wonderfully silly, caricature of a performance. Never interacting with a single cast member, I can only imagine Keaton letting loose on set by his lonesome.This plot summary is reflective of how much time the film takes to establish conflict. Even with two race scenes before Tobey is arrested, the first act is so draining and prolonged that everything becomes completely uninteresting. And you may think that Aaron Paul will save you because he's Jesse from Breaking Bad, but Need for Speed doesn't have the writing team of Vince Gilligan and pals to make Tobey a fully fleshed out and fun character. Thankfully Paul gives a decent enough performance through repetitive scenes of angst to make Tobey's cause seem believable for this movie. But still, the plot is so linear and thin that everything is paint by numbers for director Scott Waugh (Act of Valor).But thanks to Waugh's insights as a former stunt performer/coordinator, Need for Speed pulls off some of the most brain racking practical effects stunts. That's right, every car chase, crash, and race is performed with real stunt drivers without the use of CGI. With how incredible of a feat that may be, what is presented on screen is not very compelling due to lousy editing. Scenes cut back and forth between the streets and low angle shots of the driver from within the cars sporadically making a lot of the action hard to follow at times. Setting up practical stunts takes money and time, so I'm sure they had limited funds to shoot scenes multiple times and had to use what they had. The cinematography, shot by Shane Hurlbut (Terminator: Salvation; Semi-Pro; Act of Valor), is also very sub par. The movie captures none of the stylish or slick appeal the video game has.What also makes Need for Speed frustrating is that all of the races are given very poor direction so that it is a bit difficult to grasp exactly where our drivers need to be at the end of each sequence. This disregard of set up places the viewer in an awkward position because the driving feels like it drags on forever without a sense of urgency which hurts the tension in the scenes. Luckily some suspense is built up with police chases and various obstacles that stand in the way of the drivers.Need for Speed could have easily been called anything because it has little to do with the game other than the racing. In that regard you could call it a success because it doesn't tarnish the game's reputation. However, as a movie, Need for Speed fails to deliver much value for the overly long run time, weak characters, and linear plot. Moviegoers hoping to see a sleek, finely polished Fast & Furious knock off will surely be disappointed by its spastic editing and gritty cinematography.",Need for Speed

167,eskwarczynski,Better than it has any business being.,7,21 March 2016,"A film adaptation of a video game that reached the height of its popularity 10 years ago; all the while shamelessly cashing in on elements of the Fast & Furious franchise? Considering this is what Need for Speed is, it's much better than it has any business being.The film works for two reasons. First, the cinematography and stunt work on this movie is incredible. Some of the best practical driving stunt work I've seen in a film to date. You feel like you are in the drivers seat for all the action.Every wreck was shot in such a way that you can practically feel the impact. Its exhilarating, and much more powerful than the overly CGI carnage we've come to expect from the latter half of the Fast and the Furious franchise.The second reason the film works is because of Aaron Paul and Imogen Poots. The ensemble cast in this film doesn't hold a candle to that of the F&F franchise. Weak performances abound in this film, and the occasionally cringe-worthy lines they are expected to deliver don't help that. Paul and Poots however, have incredible chemistry and both carry the movie with great performances. Aaron Paul - who gave us five memorable seasons of Breaking Bad as Jesse Pinknan - absolutely invigorates this film as racer Tobey Marshall. One pivotal scene in particular showcases his raw talent. I won't spoil it, but you'll know it when you see it.Outside of the thrilling action pieces and those two performances, unfortunately, the rest of the film is a dud. Poor writing, silly character clichés, and an oddly grating and insufferable handful of scenes with an over-acting Michael Keaton keep this film from being great.

The characters are also not that well developed and do not tend to stick in your mind long after movie. All in all, it gives you nothing of value except two good hours of great visuals, beautiful cars you can only ogle at in movies or games, amazing action sequences and some pretty nasty car stunts, though, sadly, not too much of those. Still, I did find myself enjoying those few hours quite a lot, despite the plot full of holes and the totally needless sappy romance thrown in for good measure. So, if you can turn a blind eye to the lack of plot and are a fan of NFS, sleek cars, street racing and crazy velocity, you will find this movie pretty satisfying. If not, well, it will most probably be the longest two hours of your life.",Need for Speed

173,khs_thereddevil,An Surprisingly Good Watch!,8,18 June 2016,"Generally, I'm not a fan of racing movies, because of what they offer - a lot of BOOM-BANG-ZOOOM action and shaky-cam, but not much in terms of character development or making me care AT ALL about the people behind the wheel or putting in a lot of underground or rap music which blend into one another or a whole lot of other things.There were a lot of technical goofs and inaccuracies in the film, but it did not spoil the movie for me. Yes, it was not as much a ""racing"" movie like Tokyo Drift, but it had a good cast and story. This was different. Refreshingly different.The difference starts to show at the beginning itself - that slow music accompanied with Michael Keaton's great voice just set the tone for a very entertaining and engaging movie. Aaron Paul was absolutely fantastic at the protagonist (Toby) - I think he pulls of that ""hurt"" look extremely well too! Imogen Poots (Julia) also put in a great performance - had never watched her ever but Toby and Julia had an infectious chemistry which really made the road trip very watchable instead of being boring. Dominic Cooper as the villain was good too, as were the supporting cast. Michael Keaton seemed like he REALLY the Monarch - effortless! The background score was also quite good - not teeth-grinding rock-gnashing music - but fitting with the cinematography and mood.I would definitely recommend this, especially if you're tired of watching racing-action movies - this one is quite different and satisfying.",Need for Speed
174,shagrog,A fine car movie.,7,13 July 2014,"I liked this movie. It was entertaining, even though it was predictable enough to not be suspenseful.All in all, the characters were OK. The main character was the usual, with high moral values and strong emotions, the girl was cute and the villain was the ""too despicable"" type with no real character depth.So, here are my favorite and least favorite points.The good: Casting choice was good for this kind of movie. Kind of like in Fast and Furious. Not highest quality acting, but perfect for what is expected. Pretty cars, so many pretty cars. I mean, as opposed to the Fast and Furious franchise, they focus a lot on exotics. It's a movie, so cool aspect is very important. Do cars really combust that easily? Nice landscapes.The bad: I couldn't care less about the characters. On the other hand, when I left the theater, I felt like I wanted to know more about them. Well, kinda predictable, but what would you expect? Is there a car movie isn't? The finish line of the final race, in which cops are expected, is at a dead end. Did they escape? Who knows? No spoilers here. Just really great organizational skills... Oh, and since we're talking about organizational skills, if you're a secret dude that no one ever knew and you're organizing a secret race, lay off of youtube.Why would anyone participate in the final race? It's secret, no glory there, and all the cars that you could win are guaranteed to be either wanted or totaled. Plus, you have to bet a multi-million dollar car. Not fun at all. Jail seems to be extremely softed down. The sentences are way too short and they even have unbelievable privileges.It seems like there's more bad than good, but don't let word count fool you. I tend to over-stress the bad points and not really appreciate the good stuff. It was a good movie. Not running for movie of the year, but better than the last EA games and definitely better than the last 8 or 9 Need for Speed games (or how many there are back up to Most Wanted).",Need for Speed
175,rockitpoh,Bromancing and bad editing anyone?,2,14 July 2014,"I just cant believe that this movie has scored 7.1 at this point on IMDb. I actually expected a decent action with awesome cars and even more awesome chase scenes. But sadly I came away with a huge sense of disappointment. Just to be clear, I am a huge fan of the genre and the video games, but I guess it was wishful thinking to assume that on this one occasion a decent film based off a video game could be made. Need for speed is a overly shiny but under-produced affair. The editing is atrocious, I would expect more from a mediocre film student. Although minimal, there are some good shots and some of the in car scenes look almost exactly like the NFS underground series, which was well done. But as well as a a few minor pluses, there are a whole bunch of minuses. The acting is terrible! Aron Paul, who to be fair was excellent in Breaking Bad, brings little to the character, and the others? well, they might not seem out of place in some kind of crappy frat house comedy. But in an action movie? NEXT! Also, what's with all the Bromancing? These guys should just get a room, some tequila and get it over with. from a storyline point of view Need for Speed was laughable. I literally found myself laughing at it far too often. ridiculous plot, badly- unbelievable crash sequences, disturbing level of bromancing, and far too many long shots. Suspension of disbelief is one thing, this is just ludicrous. I'm just surprised I didn't turn it off.",Need for Speed
176,ccponds,"This movie makes ""The Fast and Furious"" films look like ""The Godfather""",2,22 September 2014,"As a fan of ""The Fast and Furious"" franchise, I was actually looking forward to this film. I did not get the chance to see it in the theater, so I put it on hold at the library as soon as I could. I just figured that this movie would be on par with the Fast and Furious films, if not a little worse. I remember putting the disc in the DVD player, grabbing my big bowl of popcorn, and sitting back for what I was hoping would be a semi-entertaining film. Unfortunately, this film did not meet even the incredibly low expectations that I had for it.I have a theory regarding popcorn and films: if the popcorn is better than the movie, either you have an exceptionally damn good bowl of popcorn, or the movie is just insanely bad. In the case of ""Need for Speed,"" I would say it was the later of the two choices. I did like seeing the handful of sports cars, and a few of the racing and chasing scenes were mildly entertaining, but beyond that there was virtually nothing redeeming about this movie.Reflecting on this film, I am not sure whether or not the fault was more the actors or the script. For those of you who have not seen this film, I will give you an example of the most laughable dialog. In the movie, Michael Keaton's character refers to a 2013 Shelby GT500 Mustang as ""the chariot of the gods!"" (Keep in mind this Mustang is in a movie filled with Lamborghini's and Bugatti's). And the saddest part is that most of the dialog revolving around the Mustang is walking the border of worship. The villain in this movie is so intimidated by this car and its driver that he is willing to give up his Lamborghini Sesto Elemento to anyone who can stop it from entering the final race. IN WHAT UNIVERSE WOULD SOMEONE GIVE UP A ""LAMBORGHINI"" JUST TO AVOID RACING A MUSTANG?!But that's not all. I do not remember the exact situation for this Ford car, but it seemed that, according to the film, this was the last Mustang that Carroll Shelby was working on before his death. Now, I don't know if it ""was"" the last SPECIFIC Mustang Shelby was working on personally or the last Mustang he designed. But in either case, this car sells (in the movie) for no less than $2.7 million. HOW DOES A MUSTANG SELL FOR MORE THAN A FERRARI?! Oh, and it can hit a speed of 234 miles per hour. If I'm being honest with myself, the biggest disappointment with this film is that there was absolutely nothing about this film that felt right or even fit the scenario it was in. Moments that were supposed to be comedic were not, scenes that were supposed to be taken seriously were laughable, the acting was painful, and the story was mind numbingly cliché.There have been very few films this year that have been so bad I actually regret seeing them, but this movie is one of them. This is a movie that literally was so dumb I do not even want to waste time talking about it. From a guy stripping at his job to purposely get fired to a British car collector paying $2,700,000 for a freaking Ford Mustang, I found little to no enjoyment in this film. Comparatively, this movie makes ""The Fast and the Furious"" films seem like pure gold and some of the best to come out of the last four decades of cinema.",Need for Speed

This could be the new car guy/girl movie franchise and I really hope it turns out to be. This movie lacked a popular soundtrack which turned out to be amazing, letting the cars engines mostly be the soundtrack? The most wonderful idea and it really gave a sense of realism to the races. I felt as though I was watching real races with no effects, at times almost feeling like I was in the car. The plot of this movie was great and most of the acting was stellar. The stunts were amazing, I mean some may argue that the crazier the better but I think a good action movie doesn't just show you unbelievable things done with CGI that you could never actually do but rather advertises unbelievable things in a fashion that make you feel are believable and doable.Really, Need For Speed is the best car/racing movie I've seen in a long time, rivaling early Fast and Furious movies.

181,nightshadow101,Blew my expectations away!!!,9,19 March 2014,"I'm not sure what the these so called ""critics"" saw in this movie that they needed to smash this movie down into a failure pile. I assume it probably wasn't boring enough for them like most Oscar nominated movies.I was sold on this movie for two reasons. Number 1 it had Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul as the lead who plays Toby Marshall, a former pro street racer who gets framed by a rich business associate which in turn ends up being thrown into prison. After doing his time, he seeks revenge on his mind and goes on a cross-country road race. Number 2 it is the adaption of the video game series.When I went into the theatre I had very low expectations from this movie since most video game-movie versions always end up terrible. But I wanted to give it a chance since Aaron Paul is in the lead role.The opening scenes of the movie gives you the introduction of the characters such as Dino, Julia, Benny, Finn, and Little Pete. It sets up the kind of life these people had. Toby and his friends fine tuning cars performance in his garage but at night he goes and participates in races to make end's meet. The car scenes in the movie were exceptionally well done and all real giving you a sense of adrenaline rush and a sense of realism making the Fast and the Furious movies look childish. It's amazing how they didn't use any CGI and for that I applaud them for that. I also applaud Aaron for doing most of his stunts.Anyway back on track. The story doesn't begin until the first 30 minutes into the movie or it must have felt that way due to it's slow moving pace. I must say NFS did an amazing job adapting the video game onto the big screen but however it comes with a predictable plot. The addition for new and classic cars were a plus, certainly to get an car lover to be excited for. Imogen Poots did a wonderful job as Juila Maddon and she and Aaron had great chemistry that gets build up into depth as their wild ride progresses. The ensemble cast was great and the humour was top notch.All in all, don't be discouraged by the low ratings from Rotten Tomatoes and go see this movie, you won't regret it!!",Need for Speed

I was very worried about comparisons to the Fast and Furious franchise, but I am very glad it didn't go that route. Need For Speed exceeds expectations of everybody, and I guarantee you will enjoy it.Filled with action, fast car chases, insane racing - it's what your typical car movie contains, plus so much more. Need For Speed set out to deliver something special, and it brought that and more. Based on the best-selling video game franchise with no character development or a nail-biting story, Need For Speed took the best perks from the video game series and turned it into everything that it's not. One hell of a story, great character development and actual dialogue from the driver. If you're expecting a, ""YEAH, BITCH!"" from Aaron Paul you're out of luck. Aaron Paul, though, delivers a damn good performance in Need For Speed, and from his breakout performance in Breaking Bad, Aaron will without a doubt win a couple of Oscars one day. His best lead role in a movie to date, and I hope to see him in a lot more in the near future. Take it from me - go into this film with high expectations because Need For Speed will exceed the need indeed (see what I did there?).

186,droze01,Lacking,3,29 July 2014,"If all you want to see is a bunch of nice cars racing in populated areas, risking the lives of others, I guess this would be a must see. I guess this is also true to the Need for Speed video game franchise. Overall, I think the acting and cinematography were solid. It was just the script that stank.For me, I want much more from movies. I cringe when I see movies that glamorize people risking the lives of others for fun and profit. I also have difficulty when movies do things that don't make much sense, and there were many holes in the script. For instance:The main character owns a business and he is offered a minimum of $500,000 to complete a build of a Shelby Mustang. Apparently that isn't enough for most of them, and his friends think him crazy for accepting the project -- albeit from a person he doesn't like. While I thought that pretty ridiculous, it is something that could happen.We have a two people in a 900hp Shelby Mustang driving insanely fast to get across the country to attend a race. However, they have a truck with their friend following them in a run-of-the-mill truck that amazingly keeps up with them -- starting in the same spot, meeting up with them in several spots across the country and ending up at their final destination on the same night.We have a professional race car driver that enters into an illegal street race where the winner keeps all of the cars in the race -- cars worth several million dollars. Someone pays him $5 million to enter the race. Why would anyone pay an individual 5 million to go in a race where the upside is only a potential 7 million (I assume retail value)? By the end of the race, only one car remains. All of the others appear to be either totalled or in need of major repairs, making them worth far less by the end of the race. The victor of the above race is driving a car that he ""borrowed"" and that he could not have provided to another if another person won. However, he is allowed to participate.The car that the victor is driving was evidence in what would probably be deemed a manslaughter case of the driver's friend. I have to think using it in the race would have greatly reduced the car's value as evidence.",Need for Speed

This makes every stunt 10x impressive and every scratch to a car 10x heart pinching. Please do not compare the movie to Fast & Furious series. FF is a decade old series whose characters are like family now. NFS is fresh on the block with new faces and a new story. It's like comparing Oceans series to The Italian Job. The movie features some of the BEST cars abandoned right now like the McLaren P1, Lamborghini Elemento, Koenigsegg Agura and the Shelby Mustang *droooool*The story makes perfect sense and the acting by Imgoen Poots & Aaron Paul will never let you down, not one scene. The stunts are ample and you'll never feel bored for a moment. I honestly didn't find a single flaw and hence the 10/10 rating.

188,nunophoenix-683-948557,Hidden Potential,7,9 December 2014,"Putting aside the ridiculous comparisons with the Fast & Furious franchise and all the childish fan battles, for me Need for Speed was actually a pleasant surprise and a breath of fresh air in the crowded genre.At first the movie struck me with its copy/paste script based on the video game NFS The Run and some really embarrassing lines that leave you wondering ""did she actually say that?"", along with some ridiculous and unrealistic details (Dino's uncle reporting the missing Agera's only after 7 days, those cops had to be high on donuts to believe that... Mustang's top speed and achieving it seconds before hitting a tight corner, the Agera bodywork replica that they made and named Agera R etc.) After the first impression though the movie grew on me. The ridiculousness became somewhat funny (specially if you can relate to some scenes), the acting was not that bad, the soundtrack by Nathan Furst has some really good tracks, the lack of the overused CGI and use of ""old school"" methods was a nice touch and for once you actually get to see some of the most exotic and expensive hypercars in the planet (or at least replicas) being used in races instead of just being there to show off. This also felt more mature, unlike other movies of the same genre. The fact that this flick maintained the decency by not needing to expose half naked women and have lots of swearing in its script to get the younger audiences excited and pumped up is a plus and a rarity these days. The interest for me here is the hidden potential for a new series. If the people in charge of writing the script are good enough they can easily connect some dots and create something interesting as a follow up.

190,kickbuttpotato,A total mess.,4,12 March 2014,"You know when you're casually walking down the street, and some lunatic drives past you at an obscene amount of miles an hour? You think, that driver is a moron, right? Well, Scott Waugh's Need for Speed is a movie full of morons. These people just have a total disregard for road safety and it's immensely irritating. Even if you can see past this fact, regrettably there remains a lot to be desired in this somewhat underwhelming thriller.Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul takes on the lead role of Tobey Marshall, a talented racer in his spare time, who runs a car repair shop. However when he is challenged to a race from an old foe Dino (Dominic Cooper), a close friend of Tobey's is killed during the contest, following a collision with Dino's car. Tobey is framed for manslaughter however and spends some time in confinement. Upon his release he sets off on a revenge mission, and though breaking his patrol, he embarks on a cross- country trip alongside Julia (Imogen Poots) to take part in a prestigious contest, and seek vengeance against Dino in the only way he knows how – a street race.Naturally, comparisons to the Fast & Furious franchise are inevitable, and when doing so, let's just say this doesn't come out on top. Need for Speed struggles from not truly knowing what film it wants to be. It's a more sincere, seemingly poignant piece of cinema, yet it's not nearly profound nor earnest enough to take seriously. On the other hand, it's not ridiculous or illusory enough to be considered good fun either – which is where Fast & Furious comes up trumps. The latter has tanks and aeroplanes and all sorts of absurd, farcical additions that makes for an entertaining cinematic experience. This falls carelessly between, and though this may sound like an peculiar thing to say, but in order to be a better film, Need for Speed almost needs to be worse.Meanwhile the car chases themselves are mightily impressive, making for some gripping sequences with really well choreographed stunts implemented. The film does feel humanised somewhat too, and in parts it's slightly more intimate than other films of this ilk. Much of that can be accredited to Paul, who, as expected, is the best thing about this picture. He brings a fragility to the lead, and although he's a real cool, racing car dude, there's an everyday quality about his demeanour that works well. He does seem to be doing an irritating impersonation of a deep-voiced Batman though. Talking of which, Michael Keaton also has a completely superfluous supporting role. He's like a narrator or sorts, and an immensely unsubtle one at that, effectively telling the audience what we're supposed to be thinking and feeling, naturally sensationalising it all for cinematic effect. Conversely, Poots does little to offend, though her casting is somewhat unusual, and following on That Awkward Moment, if she's not careful she's going to fall into the stereotype of just becoming a generic, vacuous, British love interest in Hollywood movies – and she's better than that.Need for Speed is incredibly conventional and prosaic, with so little innovation in this title, as a film we've seen countless times before. The formulaic, over dramatised score epitomises this notion, as clichéd songs play out exactly when you expect them to, manipulating the audience and reminding us what emotion we're supposed to be feeling at that very moment. The film also struggles to reflect real life in any way shape or form. Of course this is just cinema and not to be taken at face value – but when a film is attempting to imbue human compassion and to trigger an emotional response from the viewer, it has to be judged accordingly.",Need for Speed

Here is a racing fantasy flick with a lot of racing (some nice cars, however) poor acting is par for the course here (pun intended) and plot that is barely coherent outside of revenge. The car chases/racing scenes while trying to elude police are just absolutely ridiculous and only challenge the films Smokey and the Bandit (et. al.)!

193,Carlosmave,A great film that truly captures the essence of the video game it's based on!,10,21 July 2014,"""Need for Speed"" is an action film about Tobey Marshall, a mechanic and street racer who enters a winner-take-all race called the ""De Leon"" in search of revenge and redemption after getting framed for a murder he didn't commit.The film is directed by Scott Waugh and stars Aaron Paul, Imogen Poots and Dominic Cooper. The script is written by George Gatins.Aaron Paul is fantastic as Tobey Marshall, he gives a great and energetic performance which fits the characteristics of his role perfectly. Imogen Poots is great as Julia Maddon, she gives a charming performance that makes her and her character instantly likable to the audience. One of the benefits of the cast is that Aaron Paul and Imogen Poots have great chemistry on screen, which makes the many scenes with them together fun to watch. Dominic Cooper is incredible as the ruthless Dino Brewster, the main antagonist of the movie and Tobey Marshall's rival. The script by George Gatins is great and entertaining, it explores Tobey Marshall's quest for revenge and redemption.The movie's production team did a fantastic job too. Director Scott Waugh captured the thrill and excitement of car chases in an excellent way. By deciding against using CGI for the stunts, the chases and the races feel authentic as the actors are really taking part in them, for which they received extensive driving lessons. The way the races and chases develop reminds of some of the titles of the ""Need for Speed"" video game series without being too dependent on them. The movie features a variety of cars that range from a Ford Shelby Mustang to a Lamborghini Aventador.All this elements make ""Need for Speed"" a great action film, a movie that will definitely surprise and entertain you with the great performances, the great story and the many funny moments it offers.

195,Sahireviewzzz,even though you are a car lover i bet you wont love this film,1,4 April 2014,first of all i must say about the plot.there is nothing special.the plot is really predictable.plot is really thin and characters have nothing to do except resting their ass in cars.none of the actors will make an impression (including most acclaimed Aaron Paul) .and this film is the worst 3D film i saw.its converted to 3d just to make some more money.some races are splendid but weak plot spoiled everything.cars used are costly but you can miss some manufactures like Ferrari.music is OK.film is nicely adapted from game.you can see exactly a game but not the film.film run time is dragged.and writing is not so impressive.the only thing which impressed me is stunts performed without graphics used.crashing scenes are well executed. FINAL VERDICT:this is not even a film to watch for time pass.so please wait for DVD,Need for Speed
196,samsoknite,Better than it looks!,8,9 August 2014,"The first thing I thought when I heard this film was coming out was ""Oh no, not another money-milker."" because Need For Speed (the game) was something that I grew up with. Upon actually renting--and of course seeing--the film I realized that there was more to it than that. Unlike most car films this one doesn't really start out with a bang or huge showmanship. Which was unexpected and even, only at first, quite boring. It was there to build plot and that was something I honestly give them credit because they absolutely tried to make the film interesting and not just an excuse to watch street races and car crashes. Did they succeed? Not quite, no. It still felt like a film for the sake of action but that wasn't a bad thing at all. The fact that this film stayed away from CGI, fancy SFX, and editing trickery (for the most part) is what makes it great. I dare say that this is perhaps amongst the best of car films in a long while. I truly felt the thrill of watching a car fly by at insanely fast speeds just knowing that some guy actually did this -- not Aaron Paul -- but a guy who knew what he was doing. That with the painfulness of watching my favourite cars get trashed, albeit most were fake bodies, was something that I couldn't exactly put my finger on... It took me until after to realize that a cheesy car-film with mediocre acting actually got my involved. As for the rest we find that Aaron Paul was just about the only one who pulled off acting properly. Can't blame him or the rest really, the plot just didn't call for good acting because about cars. Honestly -- that fact alone is why this film delivers more than a good Saturday night. It was a film that I know I'd just have to watch again.",Need for Speed
197,livingstone100,"Truly awful, couldn't get through it, tried twice.",1,15 November 2014,"Who the hell rated this movie so highly? I was interested in seeing Jessie from Breaking Bad in a different role but its just not worth it. I think this may indicate he is a one hit wonder. Even Tokyo Drift which is the worst of the FF franchise is better than this movie. Michael Keaton's character is so annoying that each time he came on I reached for the off button. Otherwise, I don't even know where to start. this looks like a slick movie to begin with but nose dives after about 15 minutes. The plot is so unbelievable from the perspective of risk vs reward it just doesn't seem plausible to the point of being ridiculous. When I watch these type of movies I don't expect much I just crank up the volume to feel the engine notes but this is really disappointing in all respects, trust me this is probably only watchable for 12 year old intellects.

198,teslavate,A So-So Race Car Action Flick,5,9 August 2014,". At the very beginning I was really impressed with this movie. I mean what was not to like, HOT cars, hot chicks, bro-friends sticking together, high speed and high octane fumes! All the way up to the point where it takes, what seems the inevitable move in action movies these days, a turn to the unrealistic. In this movie that happened when the Michigan State Police started chasing the Mustang after the side by side chat with the trooper. The bro-friend in the stolen helicopter tells him he has to do a ""two lane Grasshopper"" to get away from the cops which turns into a jump using an invisible ramp and shows the Mustang about 22ft in the air and crossing 2 lanes of traffic diagonally to land in the side median lawn to drive away seemingly undamaged. First off an unassisted no ramp jump like that would be physically impossible to do and secondly even if there was a secret invisible ramp, when the car landed no one would be driving it away. That car would have been totaled, likely with a frame bent in an upward V. At that point I thought to myself, ""There goes all chance of a realistic movie and any chance of great movie."" I noted this because I read other people's reviews and opinions and they all noted the movie was great with real cars and totally realistic action and driving! This is something I am seeing in more and more movies and it just plain ruins the movie for me. Cars cannot jump off 2 story parking ramps, jump double lane streets & highways, slide through brush in the median and simply drive away with little or no damage. In this movie there isn't even a scratch on the car until they start shooting at it. At least it wasn't bullet proof. Despite this unrealistic car action in parts of it the movie still makes its bones satisfactorily. The story line was at least somewhat believable and the action was OK for the most part. One thing I liked was the lack of the typical macho fist fight that many movie makers seem to think is necessary, the adrenaline was saved up for the neato cars on exhibit in the racing scenes. 'All in all I think the movie was satisfactory, better than some movies and worse than others. It could have been a much better movie had they kept the unrealistic car action out of it and buffed up the story line. Some additional pressure to win, maybe some more concentrated race action or both. Keeping it real would have really done this movie a good deed. I just dislike the impossible jumps and crash landing that in real life would not only totally destroy the car and very likely kill the passengers too and yet the car drives away and the people don't even have a scratch. That tends to ruin the movie for me or movie it down in my appreciation anyway. This movie had good points too though. As I said there were some REALLY hot cars that we get to see in action and that's cool, but more of it would have been better. The bro-friend action was sort of OK, though I have to add here that it amazes me that they are supposedly hard up for cash, yet they own a Super Duty Truck that is a prototype for the military and has been re-equipped with a computer system and display that not only would leave the military salivating, but also be the envy of the NSA. It's all very cool but that truck in its military variant would go for about a $million bucks. With all the electronics now on it and the advanced communications that was providing flawless voice and aerial imagery, even in down town urban settings that truck would surely be worth a couple million. Where is all their money coming from? Very cool indeed, but alas not real or even near to realistic. I gave it, the movie, a 5 and that's about what it really rates in my book.",Need for Speed
199,OrangeFlamingo,I'm not even sure why I'm giving this a four. Really.,4,14 March 2014,"Oh boy. Where to even start. I suppose that first off I had way better expectations because I was a HUGE fan of Aaron Paul in Breaking Bad, considering it one of the most brilliant shows I have ever seen. I was let down. Thankfully, he wasn't the worst actor in this film. Every single other person was.This is the first film I've seen that Imogen Poots had a lead role in, and I will probably never see one again. There were a couple of parts that I had hope for her, but it only lasted a few seconds until I was questioning if this was the first film she's ever been in. I was also unimpressed by Kid Cudi (Scott Mescudi)'s performance. He is one of my all time favorite music artists and that is definitely what he should stick to, music. I guess it's not really his fault that the script was so awful and he was required to recite ""joke"" after ""joke"" that they were trying SO HARD to make funny (failed immensely), but I figured he'd have the balls to say ""I'm not reading this crap on camera."" As far as the other actors and actresses, it would be a waste of my time to even say anything about them, because it is nothing good. I don't even want to get started on Michael Keaton's washed-up performance.The entire movie flip flops between emotional scenes (which are anything but) and action scenes. None of this flows at all. The scenes where you're supposed to feel some kind of connection between characters does not succeed. Nothing builds you up to them and they're all really awkward and you will feel no differently about anyone or anything going on in the film. The action scenes seem like they were thought up last minute and felt very rushed. It was like they had a five minute time limit on each one or else someone was going to murder their family.I guess one positive thing was the visuals, which were alright. That's probably where this movie is getting rated anything above a seven, it's from the gear heads (no offense to anybody.) There were some pretty bad ass cars that were nice to look at and some of the action scenes were done nicely (looked nice) aside from feeling hurried.To wrap this up, this is one of the cheesiest and most predictable movies I have ever seen. I called everything that was going to happen in almost every scene because it's been done hundreds of times in hundreds of films, all executed in the same way. I'm still not sure why the synopsis starts with ""fresh from prison"" because how prison affected his life is touched nowhere in the movie. I know that isn't a big deal but for some reason that just bugs me. If you must see this movie, make sure someone else is paying or you have a free rental up for grabs from your local video store.",Need for Speed
200,kunal_0019,Definitely fun to watch!,8,14 March 2014,If you have ever played NFS you will like it. The story is not that great but the scenes are awesome. The cars and the stunts are amazing. If you like cars you will like this movie. There were loopholes and it could have been better but it was their first try and for that I will give it a 8 out of 10. Aaron Paul was promising and did justice to the role. The super sports cars used in the movie are simply stunning and direction is good. You get different angles and the quality is crisp.

201,mfeierskov,"It you are looking for a good movie, this isn't it, but if you are looking for a good racing movie, this isn't it either.",4,1 November 2014,"The acting is terrible for the most part, the plot is almost nonexistent and what little there is is very predictable. But let's be honest, you are going to watch this movie for the racing right? Well that sucks too, half of the movie is basically just driving cross country in a fast car trying to make us interested in the completely bland characters. It's most cringe-worthy when they are trying to act like they have actual emotions. They make these convoluted decisions like having to refuel the car while driving, and starting a police chase so a guy can see how the pulls a little to one side or whatever. All of which would have no bearing on the actual final race, because they all just end up crashing into the police or each other. The cops by the way, find some bad excuse for not using spike strips to stop the cars, but they have no problem putting a stick on the gas pedal of a cruiser and ramming it into the side of the racers.It's like the people making the movie have never seen a real race of any kind, with the possible exception of NASCAR. None of the drivers wear seat belts even though they are going around bends and are exposed to high g- forces, the steering wheels wobble from side to side when going in a straight line on what are supposed to be some of the best super-cars in the world and even though they are driving six different cars in the final race, they are never more than a few feet away from each other for the whole duration.Skip this one.",Need for Speed

204,edwardanthony9,"Energetic and Full of Adrenaline, Despite the Straightforward Plot...",7,15 March 2014,"This is one of those clear cut action film which excel in its main goal (intense car racing) but kind of ignores everything else. Plot is straightforward & not emotionally driven, but is generally fun to watch and high in adrenaline.So to begin with, the team seriously proved their ability in making the action sequences feel suspenseful and look awesome at the same time. And you can really feel intensity of the crashes and the speed. Furthermore, it feels more special with the inclusion of hypercars like Lamborghinis and Koenigseggs for the races. It is the first film for a long time to have really, really powerful cars like these, and they are simply a joy to watch. A dream come true for car fans. However, though, the plot is very much straightforward, and predictable enough. And while the use of humour is good and energetic throughout, the same could not be said for the drama. There is a genuine feel for some of the characters, but I would say it was not plot driven and instead mostly due to the brilliant acting by Aaron Paul, who was the only stand out cast. His portray of emotions & joy, along with the charisma he brings to the screen easily makes him the likable action hero we want to root for, and so everything that happens around him kind of find its way to our hearts. I believe that after this people will remember him more than just a meth maker (Breaking Bad). So, this is really an energetic and full of adrenaline action movie full of powerful, powerful cars, which makes it one worth the watch despite an ordinary plot.VERDICT:Good: Excellent & Intense car action, Beautiful inclusion of hypercars, Lots of humour, Great main characterBad: Straightforward plot, Average supporting cast, Less emotionally drivenSCORE: 7.0(blockbusted9.blogspot.com)",Need for Speed
205,michael-themistocleous,"Not terrible, just not great.",5,5 April 2014,"Need for Speed is the sophomore film of Scott Waugh (Act of Valor), bringing the highly successful video game franchise to the big screen. While not a terrible adaptation of a video game, its impact on film is very insignificant.After being released from prison for a crime that he didn't commit, street racer Tobey Marshall (portrayed by Breaking Bad alum, Aaron Paul) is set to race cross-country and to avenge the death of a friend. This seems like an interesting premise, and to be fair, the writers really had a great idea, but the script fell flat.George Gatins, who has become a decently known producer in the indie-film scene (most notably She's Out of My League), tries writing for the first time. With years of practice, one becomes better, and with a weak script, there's only room for improvement. Gatins didn't necessarily let the audience down, but he has a lot to learn about screen writing before he can write a great script. The script is cliché and gives the audience an undeveloped story-line and set of characters. The 130 minute movie drags on, trying to recreate the style of film that Smokey and the Bandit (the franchise, but more notably the first film) did in the '70s (the action movies with the intense car chases).The writing is so cliché that it honestly makes the film one of the most predictable films of recent years. The villain is introduced wearing a black turtleneck during the springtime, and the main death of the film happened to a character that might as well have been named ""I Die Soon"". It took away from the anticipation of the film, which was luckily slightly redeemed by the cinematography during the racing scenes.The biggest issue with the recreation was the over-sexualizing of cars. It wasn't done to the same extent Michael Bay does it, as he is about to make his fourth attempt with taking a children's toy (Transformers) and making it into an over-indulgent porno, over-sexualizing automobiles and characters. The film focuses on high-speed chases (which was well-done, and shot so nicely), but a good fifteen to twenty minutes is the gearing up of engines, or for lack of a better word, the ""vroom"" sound. This tires out (no pun intended) the film slightly.Although there are so many negative qualities to this elongated film, Aaron Paul shows everything that's right in the executive decisions for this film (as he made the film really enjoyable). While actors such as Liam Hemsworth and Luke Bracey were considered for the role of Tobey Marshall, Paul was ultimately chosen (which was the greatest decision for the film). Aaron Paul proves that he isn't just the guy from Breaking Bad with this emotional, strong, and quite charismatic performance. While it doesn't have the absolute strength of his performance as Jesse Pinkman on Breaking Bad, it is a wonderful follow up performance, which will hopefully lead to even more jobs in film and television soon. Paul was the most charming aspect of the film.Along with Paul, the cast features Dominic Cooper (who gives a better performance than his in Fleming), Kid Cudi (who is delightfully funny), Imogen Poots, and Dakota Johnson (whose performance is a train wreck). Outside of Johnson, the performances aren't bad and definitely don't take away from the film.As a film, it's really not spectacular, but fans of cars, the video game franchise, and properly done racing scenes will definitely love it. It's definitely entertaining, and Paul's performance is quite great (probably too great for the film).",Need for Speed
206,nincompoopian,"It delivers the races and crashes you could possibly desire, nothing more.",5,17 December 2020,"I admire ""Need for Speed"" for its realistic car action scenes and glossy cinematography (courtesy of Shane Hurlbut). But I also hate it for its preposterous plot, wooden characters, and its ironic disregard for the rules of the road for a movie that was shot in a controlled environment.The movie tells the conventional tale of Tobey Marshall, a car mechanic/pro racer who proved himself a better driver than his longtime rival (and possibly megalomaniac) Dino Brewster after test driving a custom Ford Mustang Dino made him build for as fast as 230 mph, selling it to the highest bidder for $2.7 million. (This Mustang was the one left unfinished by the death of Caroll Shelby, who was building it with Henry Ford himself.) Threatened by Tobey's reputation, Dino lends two of his three Koenigsegg Agera Rs to Tobey and one of his best friends, fellow mechanic Pete, and all three race across Mt. Kisco. Dino prevents Pete from claiming the victory by bumping his speeding car in the rear, sending Pete's Agera into the air and tumbling him to his death a la Michael Bay. After serving a two-year jail sentence for a crime he didn't commit, Tobey embarks on a high-speed quest with the cops in hot pursuit to California to beat Dino in the much-awaited underground tournament called the De-Leon, organized by a middle-aged man named Monarch, and avenge his dead friend once and for all.As a fan of the NFS video games, I'm happy to say that the adaptation's car action doesn't disappoint. Shot with little CGI (accounting for that cool digital speedometer of the Mustang), it's easy to tell the movie was insired by ""Bullitt"", whose iconic car chase between Steve McQueen and his adversary is briefly shown in the drive-in sequence. The racers in ""Need for Speed"" goes a little overboard, however, causing some traffic collisions between innocent motorists and cop cars along the way. The director, Scott Waugh, is eager to heighten the realism by plunging the viewers into the action with scenes shot from the driver and passenger's POV.Unfortunately, this ""Need for Speed"" adaptation is just another video game in search of a movie. It's so preposterously plotted that I fell asleep by the time the final act had arrived. It's a shame that its motley crew of talented cast, which includes Aaron Paul, has been let down by the cliched script by screenwriting siblings George and John Gatins. Director Scott Waugh has already made quite a name for himself as a good action filmmaker, all he needs is a better script to work with.",Need for Speed

210,littlewritingmachine,Film Authority on Need For Speed,4,9 March 2014,"Need for SpeedThe death of Fast and Furious star Paul Walker casts an eerie light over Dreamworks racing movie Need for Speed: early on, when one of his friends is burned to death in a high-powered sports car, high-flying street-racer Tobey (Aaron Paul) is brought back down to earth, but only for a few moments. In Need For Speed, road traffic fatalities are just plot- points, quickly glossed over before the next set of brightly colored obstacles come into view. It's a formula that worked well in the Fast and Furious films, but after the genuine shock of Walker's tragic death in a car accident, such jollity in the face of death may sit uneasily with the public. Now that the Fast and Furious films have shifted gears from street racing to international heists, there's clearly a gap left in the market for a street racing film: Need for Speed attempts to have it both ways by having Tobey get out of jail and leave the police far behind as he takes part in an illegal cross-country race to get to an illegal cross-country race. 'A race before the race, I love it,' exclaims organizer Monarch (Michael Keaton), but audiences may feel differently; the stakes for each race are just the same, and the action is so similar that one race blends into another.Scott Waugh's film borrows the high-seriousness and epic tone on the Fast and Furious films as Tobey and his posh girlfriend Julia attempt to get to Monarch's race. Tobey knows that Dino (Dominic Cooper) was responsible for his friend's death through dangerous driving, and has charged himself to teach Dino a lesson by driving even more dangerously. This numbskull quest is devoid of any real point: finger-pointing Tobey accuses Dino of being irresponsible, but no-one in the film ever questions whether taking part in illegal street-racing such is a good idea in the first place.It's just one of a series of idiocies, not the deftly enjoyable ones featured in the Fast and Furious ones, but ones that leave you wondering what's going on. If Tobey's car is twice as fast as the police, why can't he outrun them easily ? If he's such a good driver, why does he need rescued by helicopter? Why does Tobey plan to refuel his car from an airborne pump, but need Julia to climb outside the car to plug the nozzle in? And if he's in such a rush that he simply cannot stop, why does the next scene see him pulling into a gas station?The laws of physics have also taken a battering in the Fast and Furious Films, but Need for Speed doesn't have the same testosterone charm: when a sports car drives directly at a humvee and the humvee swerves to avoid the crash, then any credibility has gone out the window. Like Keaton's obnoxious commentator, Need For Speed is far too full of itself: aside from a few well-staged crashed, the weak plotting and clichéd characters mean that there's nothing much to see here.

211,ralphellis1979,Steaming Pile of ...,1,17 July 2014,No one expects realism from this type of movie. The best way to watch the movie is to turn off the sound and fast forward through any scene with extended dialogue or a woman. This cuts the movie time a manageable one hour with time to watch something else worthwhile. The cars are pretty - prettier than the women in the movie - and they are the only reason to watch this. The lead actor is a capable actor based on his past work but there is only so much you can do with a sow's ear.

The English woman was just awful. Truly, awful. Kid Cudi was just painfully unfunny. Lead character (Aaron Paul) wasn't any better. Definitely not leading man material. Should stick to ""geeky best friend"" roles.Script - Just unfunny and so cheesy. Switched constantly from ""emotional"" scenes (that just don't work) to action scenes (that are all a bit stale and have been done before). Kid Cudi randomly managing to get hold of all manner of air transport as if picking up a newspaper is just lame. Having to refuel ""on the go"" as they were pushed for time - but then spending the next 10 minutes drifting round a small town to scare the English girl, makes no sense. And the killer for me - the cars. Being a car movie, you expect the cars to steal the show but we are treated to some American muscle that has been seen before. The Shelby mustang just came over as a massive ad for Ford motor co. And the sound of them was just terrible.

215,donald-thomas,"No computers involved, only awesome stunt driving!",8,29 August 2021,"First I will confess: I am not a fan of cars, I am not a fan of racing, hell I don't even own a car! Why did you watch this?, you will ask. Because it was in 3D and I will pretty much watch everything in 3D. There, I said it.So I watched it, thought it was entertaining enough, and then managed to listen to the commentary from director Scott Waugh and actor Aaron Paul. Early on Waugh mentions that there were no computers involved for the stunts. Everything has been done for real. That is when my jaw hit the floor. There are pretty crazy stunts in there, let me tell you (the ""Grasshopper"" comes to mind). Scott Waugh is the son of a stunt driver, and he knows lots of stunt drivers in the business, and many of them came in to work on the film. Everything is quite precise: he mentions, for instance, that for one stunt, the car had to speed at precisely 71 mph. Not 70, not 72, 71! One must admire that.Bottom line, it's about cars, racing, good acting I thought. The plot isn't over complicated. If you want complicated, go watch Christopher Nolan's ""Inception"". If you want witty dialogues, go watch Joseph Mankiewicz's ""All About Eve"". But if you want to spend two hours watching great stunts and fun characters, ""Need for Speed"" should do the trick.",Need for Speed
216,hanhminh1705,Surprisingly enjoyable,6,31 March 2014,"I did not expect much from the movie when I first heard about it. First I hated the name, then I'm not a fan of action and car racing movies. Actually, I did expect it to be bad after the trailer. I was worried before watching this, as I am a fan of Aaron Paul on Breaking Bad, so I just hoped that a silly car race movie would not kill his career. Well, phew, the movie turns out quite good, I have to say. I enjoy 2 hours in the cinema, and I came out with a smile. Gonna be my guilty pleasure from now on. I would not say this movie is a must-see, but it worths a shot and I don't think anyone who goes see it would not feel entertained. I have always been into Oscar type movies, but this movie was cheesy and predictable in a very comfortable way. There is a plot for it (surprisingly), no real character development but I really like the protagonist Tobey Marshall ( I hope it's not biased by my liking to the role Aaron Paul played, Jesse Pinkman, on BrBa). The storyline is not strong enough, but this in some way is just helping the movie. After all this is a game-based movie, which focuses on car racing and action, so a strong plot may steal the light of action. The action in this movie is satisfying to me, some really impressive. There are flying cars and fast races (of course), and I keep thinking ""They can't be serious. They really DO THISSS without any CGI/green screen/ computer help???"". And they really do it, all the action scenes in the movie. I got that information from Paul's interviews, which makes the movie somewhat more fascinating to me. Acting is believable enough in the movie. Good may be a too generous comment (cuz there's little room for real acting in this anyway), so I would say it's ""OK"". As for Paul, some says his performance in the movie is bad, which I find an unfair judgement. Of course this role cannot be compared to his performance on BrBa, which was phenomenal, but it's decent and convincing. He totally left Jesse Pinkman behind and be racer guy in Need for Speed. At some points I feel that Aaron Paul's acting is just too intense for an entertainment and light movie like this, making the movie a little bit too drama for me. However I think Aaron Paul knows how to make a simple role look complicated, and yeah, no one can cry like him. I always like the way he cries and emotes. He deserves to be a star in the near future, and hope he'll find movies that deserve him. A rating of 6. Iwould give it a 4 - 5 on the movie scale as a whole, and a 7-7 1/2 for entertainment/car racing movies. Suitable for a group of friends, boys and girls, hanging out for fun.",Need for Speed

I watched this movie because I have played just about every need for speed game. However I was surprised that this actually turned out to be a good movie. At parts of the movie it absolutely feels like the video games. Most of the movie is driving which is fine without much story development. The story isn't an important part of this as the movie is suppose to be about driving and that's where it delivers.

I'd rather watch Vin Diesel and his stupid monotone voice over and over again... then have to sit through a c***sh**t like this ever again.

Needs more speed.,4,28 July 2014,"After the steady decline of the Fast and the Furious movies' quality and actual racing or car driven plots, I was hoping that this movie might actually offer a decent throwback experience to the earlier F&F movies. While the non-cgi stunt race sequences are good and I was personally stoked to see all the exotic cars at the end, there are FAR too many things in this movie that make these few and far between race sequences just not worth the watch. The dialog that occurs between characters is particularly cringe and takes up a large part of the movie, particularly the weird sifter radio host who at one point is focused on for the best part of 10 minutes while you desperately hope for him to go away and for the movie to get back to the racing. There are multiple, unnecessary, stupid stunt sequences in the movie that appear to be space fillers and poor attempts to do something new. Why was it necessary to have a big sequence refueling the car? Only for it to get destroyed later on? Or have them f**king air lift the car off a cliff with a helicopter? Why was it necessary to diverge to that dude getting naked and quitting his job for 5 minutes? It didn't make sense as a rational choice within the world of the film, or something that added to the film. I feel like I was promised racing but instead this movie is even more outrageous and stupid than the last Fast and the Furious movie. I don't feel like I'm a particularly critical movie-goer and enjoy big blockbuster movies, but just like Pacific Rim I feel like this movie was way over-hyped, over-rated, full of unlikable characters and that most of what people came to see was shown in the trailers (car racing or robots- aliens fighting) and the rest of the movie was poor character interaction and unnecessary minor scenes and sequences. 4/10 feels generous.",Need for Speed

But, I went to the movie with the universal rule of games-movies relation in mind. You know what they say, don't expect too much from a movie based on an existing game and vice-versa. Thats the reason I was satisfied with the results in the end. Same is recommended for my fellow gamers/movie-goers. From a gaming enthusiast point of view, nothing was extra-ordinary about this movie. We do all the stunts depicted in the movie, in these games almost everyday. And usually we get to do it our way with the story progressing at its own pace with what us being the protagonists. But as far as this movies is concerned, I'd say it was so-so. There were some unrealistic physics-defying stunts here and there, but like I said, being a gamer, I can forgive that. The pros of the movie were- Poots and the Mustang. Now, the mustang is my personal opinion as I love those cars, but Poots was amazing with her acting. She was cute, she was true to her character and she keeps you interested in the movie. The biggest let down was Dominic Cooper. The guy doesn't seem to want to get into the character. I wish Waugh had casted someone more fitting for this role.All in all, it was an okay movie.

If it wants to be a movie inspired by a video game, it fails in more than one way. The most important being the cops. The best cars that the cops were able to send against Koenigseggs, McLarens & other hyper-cars were Dodge Chargers and 1 SUV. That's simply atrocious.Furthermore, the accident that puts the main character in jail, is absolutely absurd. A bump in the rear bumper sends the Koeningsegg tumbling, flying and rolling off a bridge. However, later in the movie, when a Bugatti gets BRUTALLY RAMMED by a police car, it just spins a few times and goes off the road. That's it. Pathetic again.3rd! Music.

Thing is, and all gamers will know this, most video game adaptations end up being poor simply because the movie makers end up cramming the rich story of the game world into about two hours and it just doesn't work that way. However, the Need for Speed franchise is a racing game with little or no story at all in most titles. And that worked out very well in this movie's favor.The story is extremely simple, as it should be. I'll just leave it at that. Instead of going for something deep, this movie focuses on its true stars: the cars. The premise of the movie is similar to the latest titles in the arcade branch of the video game series: Hot Pursuit, The Run, Most Wanted and Rivals. Which means you'll be seeing a lot of exotic supercars racing and being chased around by the police.The movie is a brilliant visual spectacle. Going into the movie, I didn't believe the claims that no special effects were used for the movie and all the action and driving sequences are real. But this movie really made me believe it. There's a stark contrast in that regard between this movie and its closest competitor, the Fast and Furious franchise. While in the latter you can often tell that the action is fake and the actors aren't really driving, in this one the driving feels real and the resulting tension is far greater. Also helping with that is an excellent score, reminding me of the music from the games.So that's the main stuff. Other things? Well, the movie's main star, Aaron Paul is great, for what little character material he has to work with. Like I said, this movie really isn't about deep character development. The rest of the cast is passable, selling their respective characters, but nothing too impressive. There's some entertaining comedy value thrown in here and there and a romance subplot, obviously, but nothing distinctive.To sum it up, don't go to see this movie if you're the type of movie goer who expects to be told a good, meaningful, deep story. Need for Speed doesn't offer that. However if you're a fan of the game franchise or racing movies in general and don't mind looking past some plot and physics nonsenses, then this movie will be right up your alley.If I were to rate this from an objective point of view, as simply a movie, and not a video game adaptation, it would get 5-6 at best.

241,cyrusramsey,A beautiful mess of a movie,7,26 May 2019,"First of all, let's be clear: by objective standards, this movie isn't very good. The plot is very thin and pretty generic, and is only there to somehow tie together all the driving scenes. The dialog and writing is hilariously bad, and the characters are shallower than an inflatable kiddie pool. Obviously, this is a movie based on a video game, but it's so badly written that it kind of gives the impression that it was written as a video game and adapted to film at the last minute.That said, this is a very fun movie to watch. The cinematography is surprisingly good, especially in the racing scenes, and there is a fantastic sense of speed and realism that a lot of other similar movies lack. It's refreshing to watch car action scenes that don't have so much blinding shakey-cam and constant cuts that you can't even tell what's going on (looking at you, Bad Boys II). It's worth watching just for how well done the driving scenes are, assuming you can suspend disbelief for the action scenes and follow along with a protagonist who's a bit of a jerk to almost everyone in his life.All of the street racers who are supposedly the heroes are immature, selfish and hugely irresponsible, although I guess that's par for the course in a street racing movie. Aaron Paul's character is supposed to be some kind of macho badass, but is a pretty big jerk to almost everyone, especially Imogen Poots' character, who has very little character development and is mostly only there as eye candy for male viewers, and could be written out completely with no major changes to the storyline. Not that the male characters are much better, mind you - there's one guy whose entire personality is that he has a toothpick in his mouth all the time. Characters are not this movie's strong suit.It's not exactly a gearhead movie, either. The script pays little attention to the car enthusiast audience, and focuses more on making the cars look cool than making them plausible. The Mustang seems to have a manual transmission in some scenes and an automatic in others, there are numerous over-the-top crashes that get sillier the closer you look, and of course, there's the obligatory big jump scene that every car chase movie has, which the car inexplicably survives with no damage at all. It's hard to tell if this movie is paying homage to the cheesy chase movies of the past, or if the writers actually thought they were working on a Smokey & The Bandit reboot. Either way, it will be tons of fun for some viewers and tiresome (hehe) for others.The plot is a pretty standard revenge story. It tries to wring out a moral of some sort at the end, and when I was a teenager, I thought it was a fantastic ending. From an adult perspective, it's painfully predictable, but I will give it points for being much better than the ending of the first Fast & Furious movie.Bottom line: if you enjoy car chases and ""so bad it's good"" movies, you'll love this one. It's a decent addition to the canon of cheesy car chase movie. If you're looking for good characters and a meaningful story, keep looking.",Need for Speed

If you like super-cars, this is way better for you. If you like speed-stunts, its the best suitable movie for you !!! You will literally be gifted.One of the most amazing 2 hours and 10 minutes spent for a perfect racing movie. I was lucky enough to watch it this late :D",Need for Speed

All his lines in this movie were cringe worthy, absolutely no chemistry with the romantic interest, awkward acting, all in all, i can't really see him as a leading man.

The Jesse Pinkman who was a screw-up addict -- who was a sidekick to to the great Walter White... that Jesse Pinkman. A sidekick.But I never expected him to carry out a lead role ( He wasn't great, but he wasn't bad either). Since Fast and the Furious singlehandedly made (and destroyed) the street racing genre, I thought this would be a cheap knock-off, piggybacking on the video game's success.But without revealing any spoilers -- this was actually a pretty damn cool street racing movie.

249,debadyuti_me,On Time Go,4,6 April 2014,"Before saying anything about the movie I just want to say that in my opinion the 3d does not effect this movie much. According to me this movie is a One Time Go. When cars like Bugatti Veyron Super Sport, Koenigsegg Agera, Lamborghini Sesto Elemento, McLaren P1, Saleen S7, and even a rare GTA Spano are present its a feast to most of the eyes. Apart from this the plot doesn't seem so much of twisting nature. The stunts are down well and good. I watched the movie in 3D but that also doesn't seem to do much justice to the film. All the scenes were so so here I am mentioning about some particular scenes where you would like to the effects most. In this context I would like to tell that while watching this movie my head was not full of magnificent 3D scenes and effects from movies like Gravity, etc but still the effects could have done much better. Bottom line is that this movie is a fun to watch but for one time. The plot is plain and simple but as the title is Need For Speed so everybody can get a idea about the movie still in my opinion the movie was in NEED for something little more to do justice to the title.",Need for Speed

251,rfnsajal,Terrible than expected,3,19 July 2014,"Never expected to be up to that level, but straight down to the hole; oh man, I can't even imagine. What the hell that script writer was thinking??!! I am quite astonished that some people are commenting this action film with high mark!! Though I expect to believe that this trend is going to change when actual movie lovers sat through and tell you how terrible this movie was! Here my 3-stars (out of 10) is actually quite substantial.Story is completely ridiculous!! Poor plot, there was hardly a connection from one scene to another what so ever. Adaptation of a famous video game into movie requires a lot of passion and courage. Where almost every bit was missing! You know why? Scott Waugh (The Director) has a very limited history and he was one of two script writer. 2 (only) of his films weren't even well executed.Well acting was terrible too. Oh man, I love Aaron Paul. This dude is a great actor. But here they tried to make him speak less, slow and low tone just to make him potent. But still it was a fail. And this is what happens when you put good actors in the hand of amateur director and ridiculous storyline. Oh yes, not to mention Imogen Poots as Julia Maddon is a complete discarded of space. Her English ascent was painful. She was yelling everything, acting like she was sitting in her room trying to impress her sister's boyfriend! She was ridiculous all the way. WTF to that! Along with all these cheap acting Tobey's crews weren't any better. A pilot suddenly arrived at scene with army aerial vehicles, refueling on the go; bingo that was crap. They said they were in a damn hurry but drifting for 10 minutes on the city street just to scare an English blond, makes no sense. Then, Maverick asked for a pad to watch the race track in a prison (looked like a fake prison). Seemed like they were never a coordinated team just a bunch of clown. Michael Keaton as Monarch was acting like a sassy girl. Narrating things like a dumb ass.Put aside all the negativity, racing scenes were descent. Camera use, visual effect was good. This movie was supposed to be a rivalry between drivers and if only the movie focuses more on this aspect instead of the irrational plot, it could've been worth watching. Beside this move is about 2 hours and that's plenty of time to make something unquestionable.As a car lover and a huge fan of NFS this was not I expected.

254,thecescshow,Just as i expected..,4,18 March 2014,"The way i see it there's two different sides of this movie.In terms of ""video game movie"", it's better than most of previous video game movies that has been made. In terms of general movie quality, well... not so good..In terms of video game adaptation, it deserves appreciation because it tried to stay true to the game, and considering it's just a racing game, it's kinda impressive because the writer can just easily take the title and do a completely different storyline than the game. Instead of giving a huge middle finger to the fans, the writer really tries to please the fans. If you really played the game series, you know what i'm talking about because most of the racing tracks are similar to the ones used in the game. It deserves a bit round of applause for that.On the other hand, generally, this movie kinda disappoints mainly because of the storyline. The storyline are just too rushed and sloppy. Some might say that the story is very simple and uninteresting but that's not the case since it's majorly based on the Most Wanted version. The point is the storyline just felt out of place and rushed most of the time.And the actors kinda lack chemistry between them, especially the crew, and i don't know why but i just had problem with Aaron Paul's character. To me he tried too hard to look all tough and cool throughout the movie. And sometimes some scene just appear as dumb to me.And i do think that most car lovers will love this movie since no CGI is used during races and chases, and i think the race scenes is not that bad. So, overall Need For Speed is just what i expected it to be. You can say that the movie tried to be good, but not good enough to fully grab attention. 4/10",Need for Speed

The screenplay is painful and unwatchable, the story make no sense, there is more plot holes than a swiss cheese, the acting ..Wow... aside of the millions of dollars paid to Michael Keaton to explain the obvious throughout the movie, and the hard attempt of the kid from Breaking Bad break into the film industry, the rest are probably all classmates, relatives and random people trying to act.

To put it in a few words, I haven't seen a good movie coming out of Hollywood Studios for a long time, or at least can't readily recall when that happened. ""Need for speed, the movie"" is of those movies that you're going to want to watch for a second and a third time again and of the kind that generate sequels.I bet my life, we will see no 2 very soon.No matter what some pretentious cinema experts tell you about shallowness and clichés and lack of some obscurely defined deep meaning(thin air usually), you're going to watch a complete product, with balanced action, good characters, warm humane acting, the necessary dose of superficial humor and of course the thrill of speed. You are only not going to like it if you don't enjoy the thrill of fast driving, or if you must pretend that you're smart.Aaron Paul and Imogen Poots are revelations. They are a very good reason why this movie is not just another ctr+c, ctr+v movie we are used to watch lately. Especially Poots acting so good, as she is pretty and sexy.I am sure she is going to have a bright future and that she is reborn as a new star with this film.You won't regret paying a ticket to watch it- except of course if you are a nanny with a hobby of knitting sweaters, but hey, nobody is perfect.",Need for Speed

Also, fantastic old-school stunt driving without all the CGI bullshit. The stunt drivers they used in this movie were legit.The camera angles were amazing, and the cinematography did not involve the stupid ""shaky camera"" style of filming that seems popular these days. The film makers were not afraid to show the action happening in real time.The main character was not some pretty boy or wanna-be bad-ass.

258,D_E_Morgan,Over 2 Hours of trying to decide if I should walk out. Still not sure if I should have.,4,18 March 2014,"I had low expectations going into this movie and it still managed to under deliver in ways that I could not have imagined prior to watching. Not since the likes of Legion (2010), have I ever had such a strong urge to walk out and get a refund. It is near impossible to write a coherent review on 'Need For Speed"" (2014), considering how torn I am between what I liked and those aspects that put this movie in contention for hardest movie to watch since 2010.Let me start by saying I love exotic cars, chase scenes, crashes and since the mid 90's have been a huge fan of the Need For Speed games. This movie does deliver on exotic cars, edge of your seat car racing action, spectacular crashes and incorporated certain aspects from the video games that I did enjoy. The cinematography was beautifully done and you can tell the stunt coordinator, cinematographer and director worked in harmony to get some amazing shots during the driving sequences. The locations fit perfectly in the vision of the film and they really had that familiar feeling of the video games. The acting was bearable considering the script the actors had to work with. The dialogue felt forced and unneeded in several scenes but believable and there were no real stand out performances from anyone in the cast. With all of the aspects of this film I enjoyed, the list of film failures throughout the 132 minutes, in my opinion outweighed all the positives.The largest concern I have is, in having such action packed driving sequences meant the character development needed to be quick and keep the pace of the movie flowing. What I found was the slow dialogue scenes were stretched out far too long and at the end of the 5-10 minutes you had lost interest in the film entirely. For every 2 minutes of racing you had 10 minutes of unenjoyable story line. This movie focused too much on a story line that made no sense when taking into account the actions of the characters and their motives. Without writing a full synopsis, there is just no way to describe the inconsistencies and holes in this script. The giant list of issues is just too hard to overcome and beyond the point of laughable. I found myself bearing with this movie in the hopes the next scene would be a race or chase.This movie had potential and with a second go around in the editing room (cutting the movie down to 90 minutes), a few re-shot scenes, a slight plot shift and this could have been really good.",Need for Speed

Don't even try to compare it with F&F because they are not mutually exclusive.

260,livshim,How the hell did this make it to theaters?,1,6 November 2014,"This movie is terrible! It is God awful! And I don't mean this in that ""it's so bad that it's obviously on purpose and because of this it's fun"" sort of way. I mean that the people involved in making this film seriously thought they were making something of quality, something with depth of character and maybe some sort of message. But no one seemingly bothered to read the script and when it came time to shoot they said ""screw it, just go with it."" That is the only feasible explanation for why the entire script is made up of clichés executed as poorly as possible. You can't blame the actors for under performing because their lines are so excruciatingly, painfully awful that Daniel Day Lewis wouldn't be able to deliver with a year of prep time.I would love to also mention how this movie insults every guy or girl who is into cars by assuming that they have the IQ of a 6 year old who's been dropped on his head, repeatedly. However, someone else already did this for me: couldn't post the link so just Google ""Jalopnik Need for Speed Review.""I wanted to get into detail on this but it's not even worth it. The bottom line is that this is one of those movies that makes you angry for having just lost two hours of your life that you will never get back. And in the process, you have undoubtedly become dumber for having watched it. The stunts are spectacular, but the movie has to be at least watchable and have some sort of charisma to capture the viewer and allow them to enjoy the special effects without scoffing.Without exaggeration, everything in this movie is completely unrealistic. The way the cars are described, the interactions between the characters, the scenarios depicted in every single scene, etc. All fake. I know that some suspension of belief is necessary for a movie called Need For Speed, but not to this level. I had high hopes for this thing cause I love cars, but even the real stunts (minimal cgi) which clearly took a lot of work (and turned out great) weren't enough to hide how dreadful this movie is. I hope Aaron Paul can bounce back from this crap cause he deserves better after Breaking Bad.",Need for Speed
261,laama-1,no logic,3,16 July 2014,"This movie has one of the worst scripts ever written. It was really funny to watch so many nonsense stuff from beginning till the end. Cars were OK, but everything else was not. Acting wooden, but I have to admit I like actresses with British accent so Imoden is excused ;).OK, now some story spoilers...Plot of this movie was none, it supposed to be some kind of revenge but it fails completely. Script had to be written by 5th grader or less.Main character Tobey is former racing driver (or at least he has some experience in racing since he had beaten his rival Dino, who currently dates his ex) and he owns garage but times are bad and he has no money to run this garage anymore so he takes 1 job, provided by Dino. Dino promised him 500k for fixing some mustang which should be auctioned for 2 million. Job is done in second and car is sold for like 2.7 million I guess.Tobey and his fellow mechanic (brother of his ex) are very happy, but suddenly some weird stuff happens. Dino invites them two for a race with his uncles 3 Koenigseggs. They race for their cuts, so if Dino wins he gets Tobeys 500k, if Tobey wins, he gets Dinos 2.2 million - quite stupid uneven bet. Funny thing is that there are 3 cars, so 3rd car is driven by his mechanic/let-me-be-as-cool-as-Tobie-is wannabe who plays no role in this bet... he has nothing to win and nothing to lose, only his life. So Dino bumps his car, he falls down from bridge and dies in burning car. Tobey stops racing and tries to save his friend, but Dino does not care and wins the bet. Tobey is taken by police from crash-scene and investigated. He claims that there were 3 cars and 3rd was driven by Dino, but he cannot prove it, Dino has false alibi and Tobey goes to prison for 2 years.Next scene: two years later - like nothing happened. Tobey leaves prison and he is hungry for revenge. There is also kind of secret racing event which is hosted by Michael Keaton's character, he is just some former race driver who has his online TV show. He just sits in his lair and manages whole race from that place. He never even left to see actual event. Anyway... prize for driver who wins the race are cars of other drivers. Dino will be at this event so Tobey needs to get invited to revenge his dead friend. So he contacts buyer of that 2.7 million mustang and borrows this car and promises couple millions, because he will (for sure) win that race and gets all those cars. Next day mustang arrives to Tobey's garage with British girl behind the wheel. I'm quite tired with this nonsense so I will fast forward to the finale... Tobey destroys that mustang so he has no car to compete with. Then his ex comes with keys of garage that contains that very Koenigsegg which Dino used to win the race and kill Tobey's friend 2 years ago. So Tobey has new car for free (or so). He came to race, and suddenly everybody know that this car was used to kill Tobey's friend and it is the evidence that Dino kills him (I don't really know how could that car itself proofs anything, but whatever). There are 6 drivers in this race, 4 cars gets totaled and only Tobey and Dino remain. Dino crashes, Tobey saves him from burning car and wins the race. Police arrests them both.Next scene: 6 months later we see Tobey leaving jail and his British girlfriend waiting him with other mustang, quite same as the one he totaled before. - The End.Btw, Tobey has also 3 other friends, 2 mechanics and 1 chopper/plane pilot, but they are so unimportant to whole story that they almost don't deserve to be mentioned.Total nonsense:Tobey wins final race. All cars are totaled except Koenigsegg which he actually stole from Dino and has no right to drive it. Mustang was totaled too, script writer somehow forgot that Tobey has to pay for that mustang but he has nothing to pay with - all totaled, yet his girlfriend came to pick him from jail with new car, everybody lives ever after and no one cares how Tobey pays his debts.Moral of this story:You can get expensive racing cars for free and you are free to destroy them with no consequences. You will get revenge, girl and happy ending. - dream of every 5th-grader",Need for Speed

The lead actors were quite refreshing and I found their acting very natural. Of course there are clichés and cheesy situations, but this is a piece of entertainment and it delivers.

264,j-dedycker,Another VG adaptation?,3,11 August 2014,"When I first heard about NFS being put to film, I was -to say the least- skeptical. A lot of VG's should be left just that - a video game. Some games would provide great source material, like with Max Payne. Uncharted, Halo and thousands more have great potential. Even a game like Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter, as bad as the movies might be, there's potential and a back story.I've been a big fan of NFS ever since I got my copy of NFS 2 SE. But, it's racing. Arcade racing. Very very good racing. Nothing more.For this movie, my expectations were low. I wasn't expecting anything as ""good"" as a Fast and Furious movie. I was disappointed.First off, there's the acting. I don't really know Imogen Poots (blonde British chick) or Scott Mescudi (black pilot), but both were having a race of their own: ""worst acting put to film in 2013"". Both won.Then there's Aaron Paul. I liked him in Breaking Bad and he seemed like a very nice guy from the interviews, but on here he was just very... average at best. Maybe it's the writing but he has one expression (crooked eyebrows trying to figure out where he went wrong to end up in this movie).As for Michael Keaton, I'm glad to say that Robocop is actually an improvement on this. Hardly a compliment though.But, all suffer from terrible writing. I'm not going to spoil anything, but the plot holes just keep stacking up. And they are huge, gaping holes. Compare them to the debt of a medium-sized country. All seems very, very contrived in order to get 6 amazing cars together and have them race illegally from A to B.But then the racing starts. The 'main' car might be considered a let down for car nuts. But the other cars are not. The 'grid' is a full on NFS super grid. The scenery will remind you of NFS like you wouldn't imagine. I don't know how they did it, but the racing did feel like Need For Speed. It's hard to grasp, but the nostalgia to NFS 2 SE and NFS Hot Pursuit (original) were there all the way.Would I advise this movie? No, not even to the biggest car nut or NFS fanatic.But, if you have a copy somewhere and you just finished watching Sharknado and want to look at something a bit more serious, skip to the racing part of this movie and enjoy the ride for a couple of minutes.3/10 for capturing NFS, great (largely unmodified) cars, and good cinematography.

265,kyle-hodge,A pleasant surprise that shouldn't be taken seriously,7,28 March 2014,"This movie pleasantly surprised me! I have seen all of the Fast and Furious films, and I only enjoyed the fifth instalment. Those films were the reason I was not expecting much from this movie. The positives from this film stem from two things – Aaron Paul and the cars. Let's start with the acting. Aaron Paul was a solid leading man in the film. While a tad clichéd, he had enough charisma for us to be attached to his character, Tobey Marshall. His chemistry with Imogen Poots's character was very genuine and real. Kid Cudi has a supporting role, and while some of his earlier jokes in the film were very forced and fell flat, he grew on me towards the middle and end of the film, and his jokes started connecting. Michael Keaton also has a nice small role. Dominic Cooper, who plays the villain is fine, and the rest of the cast is forgettable, with Dakota Johnson being the only cast member to turn a bad performance. Now onto the cars. Wow. The cars were beautiful. Featured in the film was a Bugatti Veyron Super Sport, 3 Koenigsegg Ageras, a Lamborghini Sesto Elemento, a McLaren P1, a Saleen S7, a heavily modified 2014 Ford Mustang, and a 2015 Ford Mustang GT. Even a GTA Spano made an appearance. My favourite has to be the white Agera that is featured earlier in the film.What added to the fact was that all of the stunts were done without CGI, which made everything maintain a sense of realism. Now it seems like I'm gushing over this film, but it was just a solid popcorn film. The film was incredibly predictable and clichéd. The plot had so many holes in it, and the movie was filled with inconsistencies, especially revolving around Imogen Poots's character. One minute she would know almost everything about a car, and the next she would be a hapless damsel in distress, barely knowing how to drive. There's also a certain scene trying to get one of Tobey's former crew-mates that is completely ridiculous, and absolutely unnecessary. It did feel a little long, but the high-octane racing kept me engaged. While it shouldn't be taken too seriously, Need for Speed is an enjoyable watch.",Need for Speed

The best authentic no CGI fake cars or wrecks all, old school real cars getting destroyed and flying down the streets. It was fairly predictable to me though I am a HUGE movie fan over 5000 seen. Still it made me feel the way I felt the first time I watched Fast and Furious! I like how they had no stunt drivers and they trained Aaron Paul how to actually drive the cars to make it more real. They replicated the cars to ensure that if/WHEN they did wreck the cars they could truly wreck the cars with no CGI involved.

I can happily say that I wasn't disappointed! I didn't want to spoil anything for myself, but I couldn't help reading a few reviews before I went to see this. I'm glad I did because someone heartily recommended seeing this in 3D, which we did. I don't usually do 3D unless we go to the Giant Screen in Birmingham, and generally I don't like 'real actor' 3D films, but this was something else. The racing scenes in particular were fantastic in 3D! Now, as much as I don't want to, I'm going to mention Fast and Furious. I'm sorry! But you just can't help comparing the two. However, I've only actually seen the first and sixth films in the series, so I have a slightly fresher view on it. In my personal opinion, I prefer Need For Speed. I liked the characters more, I liked the racing scenes more, and in some places this film was absolutely hilarious.My only criticism would be that it lacked emotional depth. Perhaps a silly thing to say taking into account the genre of film? But that's what I thought, nonetheless. The romance was nice, but I didn't really see how prison really effected Aaron's character.

You would think that if you lost your brother in a fatal car crash, that you would give up racing. However, Tobey feels the need to put others lives at risk when he challenges Dino to race in the De Leon. It makes absolutely no sense. And after all of the damage and endangerment caused racing across the entire U.S., he only goes to jail for 6 months. Now, I don't expect the movie to be realistic. But I do feel a need to empathize with the protagonist. This movie did not deliver in that regard. Although Aaron Paul's acting was very well done given the script he had to work with.If you're into racing and cars and action, you'll like this movie. If you want something mentally engaging, skip this one.",Need for Speed
269,IronChris5,Guess you can't expect much from this type of movie,5,9 August 2014,"First off, let me start by saying that the racing scenes are the only good part of this movie. And even they seem like they are somewhat out of the video game. The cgi has moments that look extremely fake. However the fact that the cars and racing are good is important since that is what this movie is about, however the rest of the movie is awful. The acting is atrocious. Kid Cudi is just a younger Curtis Jackson and just as bad as him. Michael Keaton is basically an insane millionaire who is on his podcast constantly and can tell whats happening at the end race even though he can't see the race. Aaron Paul and Imogen Poots are the best actors and even they are not as close to good as in Breaking Bad or That Awkward Moment. They don't look composed half the time and the rest is just blank staring, this may be a fact of how terrible the writing is though. On that note, the writing is atrocious, scenes are skipped entirely (2 years later or no back story of the dad,he is just dead) while a scene where a guy quits his job and streaks around the office is shown in it's entirety. The character stripping is only a side character and is barely even a factor in the movie. Lastly, I know the end is going to be a clichéd race with lots of cops and the bad guy ""getting what for"" but seriously?! Not getting rid of the murder weapon (car) and then blatantly killing others without any consequences. Terrible. And the fact that Anita never questioned anything even though everyone knows her husband is nothing good. I guess you can't expect perfection out of this type of movie but seriously this movie is phoned in for most of it. Just look at the acting and lazy writing.",Need for Speed

I was really excited when I found out that there will be a movie. On top of that, I am a really big fan of Aaron Paul mainly because of his role in Breaking Bad. Anyway, I thought that it would be just an average movie but it was better than I expected. It is true that we have seen thrilling car chases in Fast & Furious, but I enjoyed this one more. I don't know why there are all these negative reviews about this movie. It has unexpected moments, the plot is surprisingly intriguing, the acting is brilliant and it is overall brilliantly shot. Watch the trailer before watching the actual movie, it's also really well-made.

I was reluctant at first because of all the critical reviews but decided to disregard them. I came in half an hour late but sat through until the ending and walked out honestly feeling that Need for Speed has brought car movies to a higher caliber. Perhaps it is the excellent acting, witty dialogue, or the authentic stunts but I found this movie very enjoyable. It makes The Fast and the Furious look like a bunch of amateurs.The storyline and stunts are quite believable (even to me and my skeptical engineering background). The humor was not excessive and genuinely funny. Finally, the chemistry between Tobey (played by Aaron Paul) and Julia (Imogen Poots) was electrifying. Both played their roles excellently and were very believable. The timing, delivery of lines, and genuine emotion expressed by both actors elevated the movie to another level.Don't listen to me though, see it for yourself!",Need for Speed

It normally gives you goose bumps seeing the hero win, even though we know that how it is gonna end. But in this movie, there is no passion. The story never connects. There are only some moments during the final race, where we actually see the potential of this movie and how good it could have been.NFS can be used as a treatment for insomnia...and can save hundreds of dollars in medical bill.Feeling sorry for Aaron Paul, he deserves much better...!!!",Need for Speed
273,wahsatchmo,Don't try to be serious if you refuse to follow through,3,11 August 2014,"I liked the Fast and Furious series except for Number 2 (heh, number 2). I like Aaron Paul. I've played many of the Need for Speed games, and quite enjoyed them. I didn't like Need for Speed, the Movie.The movie gets an automatic two stars because I watched it to the end. Not in one sitting, of course, but I made it there, and for that I feel it accomplished something by convincing me to waste my time.It gets a half star because the actors at least tried, and another half star because it featured nice cars framed nicely.Everything else, is stupid.There was a rather funny part of Red Letter Media's review of the Star Wars Prequels where they challenged their friends to describe certain characters in both the prequels and original series without naming their professions. I challenge you to do that with this movie as well.Fast and Furious: Paul Walker--conflicted; sense of justice; loyal to a fault. Vin Diesel--fatherly, brotherly, strong, yet fearful.Need for Speed: Aaron Paul--loyal-ish? Revenge-ish, Compassionate-ish? There are no other characters even worthy of mention, because the main villain is just simply asshole-ish, and that's about it.It's just bad writing and bad story-telling. Paul's motivation for racing was simply overwrought, and then the writers were told, ""But that's okay, the cars are really the stars of the movie!""Then why make it so serious? If you go there, then you have to explain how stupid the final race is.Here's the SPOILER: The final race is where several named but uncharacterized racers (except for Aaron Paul and the bad guy) bet their cars in a race where the winner takes all the cars. Except that the race is actively promoted by a radio jock (Michael Keaton), so every racer's identity is known, and law enforcement is ready and waiting.What do you think happens when property is used in a felony crime, such as vehicular assault? The state or county takes it. What happens when supercars are wrecked, even if they aren't seized? It costs close to the cost of the car to fix it.So the winner would take home nothing, and would be arrested. But it's okay because Aaron Paul just wanted to prove his innocence!What about the other idiots in the race? Why would they even be there?The fact of the matter is, the motivation was way too serious for the racing it was supposed to justify, and featured very few of the actors' talents. Keaton got it for the few moments he was on screen. But it doesn't make up for the fact that the director didn't encourage any other actor try to ""hit the cheese.""And then there's the ultimate flaw: the racing isn't that good. The Need for Speed games employ graphical effects when you hit the NOS, and there's a real sense of exhilaration and danger when you whip by another car on a boost, narrowly avoid an oncoming car while knowing there's a turn coming up that you may not make. That's what they should be promoting, and they failed by not making Aaron Paul a bit of a devil- may-care screw-up.The movie makers tried to make Aaron Paul into Paul Walker and Vin Diesel combined, and they instead left us with neither.",Need for Speed

Unfortunately, every line and every scene will have you rolling your eyes in agony. The movie makes no sense whatsoever.I think the problem is that they adapted the movie from a video game. Video games many times are unrealistic. They did nothing to try and tie the unrealism of the video game with the unrealism of this movie. The things people are doing with these gorgeous cars just simply would not happen in real life.I know Aaron Paul is an outstanding actor, but for some reason (script, directing?), he was terribad. There was one line that another actor says in the movie to Aaron where you see Aaron look away slowly.... The look on his face appears to say ""oh God this is terrible, why am I here?""

Some things about the plot really don't make any sense and get a little annoying over time. But whoever's played the video games, especially the ""newer"" ones, from 2005 and on, knows that they also have that there. The NFS for cell phone also has this stupid ""story"" that no one cares about. But for the record, some things that annoyed me were:1 - One dimensional characters; 2 - Dakota Johnson pre-50 Shades hasn't really changed at all, it's just as if she's already playing Anastasia, dull and dumb all the way, dating the rich douche; 3 - 45 hours of cross-country driving and no one needs to pee or eat? Only one refueling and one gas stop? OK... 4 - Hey, lend me your 2.5 million car so I can destroy it! 5 - The chase in the desert was ultra stupid (how did they know they were there?) 6 - And, the worst part of it all, the truck crashing into them and leaving. I mean, WTF??? In downtown SF?? Really? And nobody saw that? It was completely pointless and unnecessary.

So assuming they still don't want to change the plot line so as to keep in line with the book's story, they end up jumping from one plot to another without doing justice to each one, while hoping that at-least the readers of the book will get where the movie is heading?Well Need for Speed is like one of those movies, except that it's not an adaptation of any book. Like, none of the versions of the game had any serious plots that could be used to make a movie, so the makers basically had complete freedom to come up with their own story to sprinkle around the racing scenes. Looking at the outcome, I can only imagine the writers partied all their time away and on the day when they had to submit the script, spent 30 mins to come up with this, while still being hungover from the last night.From start to end, the movie made no sense. Like another reviewer said, they'd have been better off releasing it as just a collection of random racing scenes(which were well shot by the way).Like my summary states, I can't believe I had high expectations out of this, but in my defense, I assumed the owners of a pretty successful game would have put more thought into who they were selling their franchise to.Aaron Paul tried hard, but he had pretty much nothing to work off of and I feel for him.

299,evertonfangames,Pleasantly Surprised,7,29 March 2014,"I went into this movie expecting an average movie and I could have easily given this one a miss if I didn't know Aaron Paul was the main star. Plot: Although the movie had an intense race at the start, I wasn't feeling anything until the Koenigsegg race. I actually had goosebumps when Pete was killed. It was hard to watch Aaron Paul kneel down and look at wreckage but I do think they dragged out Tobey's reaction for too long. I actually really liked the road trip, I felt it was well balanced between humour and intense action. Although Kid Cudi's (Benny)jokes weren't the most witty or creative, I felt he presented them well and I actually had a good laugh at him in the news chopper. I also thought Finn in the office was pretty funny. Although nude jokes aren't the most original and it seemed a bit of a weird reaction to do so, Finn's strip scene was pretty funny, especially the 'cold' joke. Yes the ending was very predictable but to be fair, you can't do too much else with Tobey coming out on top. It was nice to see it wasn't all perfect with Tobey going to jail (gaol for Aussies). Actors: While Aaron Paul probably wasn't as convincing as he was in Breaking Bad, I felt he did a good job and someone I genuinely warmed to him (unlike some of the others in Fast and Furious). Dominic Cooper gave a pretty good performance as Dino. He was a cold character who I disliked, which I guess is pretty good acting wise as that's what he's supposed to be like. In saying this though, there are a lot of villains who I actually really like (Darth Vader, The Joker, etc...). Imogen Poots did the job as Julia, I didn't mind her but if she died I wouldn't be too fussed. I thought Tobey's crew was pretty cool, no stand-out performances but no one I really disliked either. Finally, Peter was decent. I reckon he'll get a fair bit of criticism but his character is meant to be naive obviously. Also I really liked Batman I mean Michael Keaton as Monarch. I found him a bit unsympathetic towards everyone who died and the whole man-slaughter situation but he was a good showman who added entertainment to the race. Stunts and Action: This is obviously my favourite bit about the film. I am amazed that there's no CGI and props to Aaron Paul for doing most of the action. The scene where the Police Car gets thrown into the Lamborghini was crazy! Also, Pete's car getting flipped and rolled was crazy and added to the intensity of the scene! Action Realism (if that's the way to put it): I expected a lot of unrealistic action sequences because of Fast and Furious. What I liked is that pretty much everyone who flipped the car (besides Dino and Tobey) died. There's no diving catches between two highways or 30ft jumps onto a car with no damage. While there isn't as many near death scenes as F&F, the movie stays relatively realistic as far as action sequences go (with a few exceptions). Conclusion: A nice feel good movie with a decent enough plot. Without the awesome action sequences it would be lower but the tremendous effort without CGI deserves recognition as many who watch aren't too concerned about the plot. I like the way they used really good cars (Koenigsegg, McLaren etc...) rather than suped up Nissans and Toyotas. Acting wasn't Oscar worthy but still good enough to engage. A good starting ground for Aaron Paul as a silverscreen actor. Although some might not find the jokes too funny I thought they were good enough to get most of the audience laughing and the cinema I was in lost it with the News chopper. Like I said the ending was predictable but still well done. It was never going to be a top 250 movie but it was still well done and the audience should be very satisfied with what they were given!Final Rating 7.5/10",Need for Speed

I remember feeling disappointed with other racing films that portrayed an interesting enough story line, but terrible acting. I was quite impressed with the acting in this film. Aaron Paul in particular (from Breaking Bad) was amazing. He is so good at portraying emotion. I could completely empathize with how he was feeling throughout this movie. I enjoyed his acting so much that I downloaded all the rest of his movies. I can't wait to check them out.I quite enjoyed Imogen Poots in this movie as well.

I will say that any cliché in this film is hugely overcompensated by the Cinematography work that was put into this picture, making you really feel like you are in the races with these cars, and the fact that the director refused to use any CGI and do everything practical really gave a nervous feeling. Loosely taking plot points from some of the video games, the film does everything it can to keep you engaged in the story.

Then we met the girl... she acted way too stupid (bad script), and once again it was easy to guess what happens... instead of being stupid she knows everything.Too obvious of a beginning for a racing movie. The story was way too cheesy and something we have not already seen, it was not exciting at all when you knew what was gonna happen. At least the original Fast and Furious had somewhat exciting story and now later on its just getting better and better, reason being it actually has a background story for each movie ever since the first one came out, this one didn't have yet... thats why you should explain at least a little bit who the people are. Just a little bit so that they aren't too easily expendable in the eyes of the viewer.Lets stop the rant for a moment, everything the movie was actually made about was well made... i loved the sounds and the cars themselves. The stunts were made practically and no CGI used.I got what i came for but i expected more...7/10, i couldn't lower it more because i love cars and racing, but the story and how it developed ruined a lot.

308,pengbsam,Unexpectedly bad,3,31 July 2014,"I played first version of NFS back in 1996, hasn't really follow up as much since 2005 since they haven't really done anything new lately. But the game was a legend. It was so much better than everything else out there for years. Of course then everyone else caught up and innovation went dry. I had friend who worked on that franchise back in the days, I even got a level design template when I was in college and it was so impressive to see the process to making a race game. With that said I am surprised that this movie didn't come out in 2004 or 2005 where NFS franchise was at its all-time high. Instead in 2014, younger kids will as, that sounded familiar! Is this a book? Back to the Movie, it sucked, pretty much very each way possible, every point of view, even the action sequence wasn't that good. If you are making a movie about cars and race, focus on the damn car. There were 7 million plus dollars' worth of the cars in the final race scene, that should've been the highlight and not the main character, Toby whatever. Don't really care for the main character, didn't like him in the breaking bad and certainly not going to start liking him now! He is a horrible actor, so no surprise he is in this movie in a leading role. Story line, if there is any just really sucked.Racing scene was not believable, trying not to Mustang hating. But in what race can a Shelby beat a Veyron? Or P1 or Element or Saleen or Torino. Anything in that movie. I guess the only thing it can beat are those 90's beat up old Ford Crown Vic police cruiser. You put 900 + HP in a car that get tailed by couple of police car in an open high way chase? It should be: start: Zooooom, ""where that Mustang did go?"", ""Suspect evaded us, air support please!"" That's it, I am not looking for anything deep or meaningful out of this kind of movie. To prove the point, I am a huge fast and furious fan.

Even the redoubtable Michael Keaton (obviously a seasoned pro), leaves one thinking that he simply needed a day's work (all his scenes are shot in the same set, likely in one day). Maybe his Veyron was in the shop.It's hard to conceive of a way the performance of Aaron Paul, whose work in ""Breaking Bad"" has been so highly touted, could possibly have been any worse. He should be relegated to the role of Sidekick, or better yet, Sidekick's Best Friend.Amazing that $66 million was spent to produce a film so compellingly awful.

In fact, despite the fact they're mildly fun, I veer clear of them quite wildly. However...This movie is different. I decided to watch it because of my affection to Aaron Paul (Jesse from Breaking Bad), and, despite the fact that I think his acting was somewhat sub-par and needs a lot of work, he and his entire support cast make watching this movie really fun.The script isn't too witty, but nor is it stale and dumb. The dynamics between the actors are amazing, and even though they each alone may not be the best actor (Or actress), together they make a solid and lovable team.The witty remarks and insults, the hilarious radio chatter, and the childish behavior the actors and the script portray make this a film that, whilst takes itself a bit seriously, makes sure to keep it very light. I don't think the story was altogether predictable, and even if the ending was - The road toward it *DEFINITELY* wasn't. What I loved most about this film, however, was the fantastic pace. It just keeps running. I spent 2 hours watching this film and had neglected to text my girlfriend while at it - And when she whooped me for that, I told her, without lying, that I simply could not comprehend how fast time flew. It literally felt like action packed minutes. It was truly intense.If you want a somewhat-feel-good, somewhat predictable action flick with a solid team of actors and a good script - This is for you. If you're looking to spend 2 hours of your time watching a solid movie you won't regret watching (And you like action), this is the film for you.Heck, to be honest, I've tried my best to hate this film.

There is even a nice showcase of different aircraft, which is also a lot of fun.

Miss Poots was amazing...and such a beautiful smile. The support was OK...very amusing, but not overdone or spectacular. Micheal Keaton as ""The Monarch"" was great and his role necessary to provide narration and cheer-leading for the racers...some have criticized his place in the movie - some meta, rich guy with a weird pod-cast that all of the gear heads faithfully follow? Remember this based in a video game and his place and his role fits in that context...as does ""Liar One"".The story was pretty good...of course money is one of the biggest motivations, and it's in there...but the movie attempts to go deeper and provide a more personal motivation for the main's actions and I think they pulled it off quite well...I could feel the emotions of the characters in certain scenes, so the story and the actors definitely did the job.Great movie for car lovers and fans of the video game series...I can see how someone not into those things might not be impressed though.

Not in a irritating way, they put it in subtle. Even if you don't know the game, you don't notice them.Taken all facts together, the movie is just good. Yes it is not perfect or outstanding in a way, but compared to some other speed movies, this is a joy. The actors are real, growing after the movie is progressing. The scene is developing and it is building to a total picture. A plus is also some moments are just skipped, wonderful. The fur filling of the car, the time in prison, it is just skipped. Not just adding some time to try to compensate a lack of story. Nope, the point is clear, skip it and go on with the story what it is about.For a writer this takes guts, for a director it takes vision to compensate the feeling that you are missing maybe an essential part of the story.With all of this in the movie is just great, for the game fanatics as well as the rest.

334,leo-niecn,Beyond Expectation,10,22 July 2014,"For some reason this movie divides people. You have almost 70% people rating this movie above 7.0 (which is an OK score for a movie), but you also have many low ratings, and some reviewers even ask the meaning of the title ""Need For Speed"", without knowing this is a game-adopted movie. I played NFS before. NFS is a straight-up racing game, with occasionally cop-chasing (hot pursuit). What NFS is not is a story-driven game. There isn't any story in the game, and that's what worries me transforming this into a movie. How can they create a story out of thin air, but also capture all the cool elements in the game? So I had very low expectation going in, especially knowing what kind of tragedy people can make in those game movies (Prince of Persia movie was bad and Tomb Raider movie was horrible).However, it was so much fun. It is intense, and it got my full attention for 2 hours. Imogen Poots was funny. The story was decent (better than 70% of all movie stories). Audience is emotionally engaged with the characters. Some reviewers are asking for character development. Come on, it's a car-racing movie. What kind of development are you looking for? As far as the racing goes, it's intense. Racing on different roads without being ""intentional"". Everything feels very natural and spontaneous. I thought the finale would be boring because the previous racing was too good. Nope. I almost screamed seeing that Bugatti Veyron roaring away.So to conclude, this is a great movie. It's worth the praise.",Need for Speed

But the bits that I couldn't stop laughing at were the 'racing' scenes.These 'drivers' in the film are meant to be great drivers, in fact they are just public menaces with complete disregard for the law in which it is considered that you must be a good driver if you cause an accident to an innocent bystander and/or drive the wrong way on a street.There is no logic to this film at all. The refueling scene, is frankly one of the most ridiculous scenes I have seen a long time, and i know it was not meant to be, but is one of the best bits of comedy I have seen to date!Honestly, watch this film, it is so terrible that you should not be able to stop laughing",Need for Speed
338,gonzalomena,"Great cars, decent action but... Story?",5,18 July 2014,"I know that watching a movie based on a video game is usually accompany by very low expectations in the storyline and character departments, and on the counterpart, high expectations on special effects, non stop action and a wink or two to the gamers that have enjoyed the original titles. This movie excels at none of the above, sadly. Having played almost all the titles of the Need for Speed saga, I think in my humble opinion that they could have done so much more for the story. They had the resources, the casting wasn't bad, and the franchise was ready to take to the next level. Sadly, the story was so predictable and plain, you just couldn't get invested in it. I love movies of any kind, and I'm easily entertained by them. It doesn't take much to get me invested in characters and plot lines, but this movie really failed on that area, and again, they could have don so much better with what they had at their disposal. Just copying the plot from Need for Speed: Most Wanted would have been far more interesting.On the good side, it was good to see a big production like this one using ""new"" talent, rather than just feel it with stars that don't really feel comfortable in a movie like this. The soundtrack was interesting, like the cover songs they used. Scenaries in general were pretty good, specially while racing in the cities. Overall, it's not an awful movie like most game based projects end up being. But as a fan of the game for more than 10 years, I truly believed they could have done better.",Need for Speed

While not perfect, this film is a perfectly enjoyable thrill ride that demands to be seen in a cinema. The cars in the film - for a car lover or not - are a spectacle, and seeing them blown to pieces is somewhat enjoyable when you realise that barely any CGI was used in the film! All of the stunts are real! The writing in the film is, well - less than stellar. There was one piece of dialogue in particular between the two lead characters about ""blue eyes"" that had me cringing off the edge of my seat. The film is often genuinely funny as well, which adds to the tone greatly. The film also benefits from the direction of Scott Waugh - a stuntman - who clearly knows what he is doing with practical stunts. Acting is decent all round, with a particularly strong performance from Michael Keaton, even if his talent is kind of wasted for a limited amount of screen time, a good attempt from Aaron Paul for his first motion picture and a frankly cringe-worthy performance from Imogen Poots. Overall, a perfectly enjoyable, fun night out at the cinema!",Need for Speed

I hope next game will be more to like this movie. Just give a chance Need for Speed. Because this movie is better than some bad copys of game-movie examples. What do we expect such movie like Need for Speed? Fast cars, racing, crash, funy moments, little drama and full adrenaline. If you expect more than that this movie doesn't for you. I think Need for Speed story's is good enough. It's not a novel award story of course but like the game stories. Need for Speed is a good way.

341,victoriapham89,Mind-blowing,7,24 March 2014,"Need For Speed (2014) Normally as we see in Hollywood action flicks, when a film gets thoroughly invested in some certain aspects, the others may be forgotten or poorly made. Need For Speed is one of them.Pros: If you're a big fan of super luxurious fast cars, if you seek true car races with endless car drifting and flying, this is it. Sparkling Ferrari, Bugatti, McLaren, Koenigsegg... the most expensive cars on the planet, some of them are even worth more than the actors's rewards, provide you from the very beginning with splendidly dangerous car races. I can't remember how many times the audience went ""Ohh"" or ""Woahhh"" when those appeared on the screen and when the engines ""roared"". It makes you feel the desire to bring one of them home or even to ""marry"" them :)). On the other hand, the film spends a quite not small budget on cinematography. Tremendous car races with wide breath-taking cinematography on extraordinary landscape are truly mind-blowing. I was hardly able to keep my mouth shut every time it came to the races. Not choosing the 3D version in the first place is such a big mistake! Character development is way more realistic than in F&F franchise. No big muscles, no tense fistfights, just some random normal dudes in a society of car racing solving their personal issues, more emotional, they have weaknesses, they lose, they win... These are actually closer to our daily lives.Cons: If in F&F franchise, each character has their own personality which is recognizable, in NFS, only some of them make small impressions, just because they appear more on screen than the others. Aaron Paul's character is rough, sometimes he tries so hard to play cool as Dom does in F&F but sadly he fails. Cooper's villain has nothing special and not even close to dangerous to become unforgettable, absolutely opposite to Aaron Paul's heroic Tobey. This is so typical and predictable as you'll see where the story will go towards the end and who's the villain, who's the hero. Besides, the film is full of plot holes, which are expected to be in this kind of movie. It is slow-paced, lots of unnecessary silly acts.Need for Speed is one of the better attempts at translating a popular video game into a big screen experience, with the practical stunts and real-world action serving as a nice counterbalance to Fast and Furious's ever-increasing ridiculousness. Its silliness, predictability and over- inflated running time keep it from being a truly great movie, but it's still a hell of a lot of fun. Both of of them make us feel the same thing by the time the credit rolled: Getting the vehicles and drive...FAST!!! :v 6.8/10",Need for Speed
342,przy0059,Entertaining Movie,9,16 March 2014,"I went into this movie, like most, thinking about Fast and the Furious. I'm pleased to say that I came out not thinking about it. Aaron Paul is separating himself from his Jesse Pinkman role, and he did a great job of it in this movie. Raw emotion, real action sequence, and fast cars made for an entertaining movie experience. It was a good break from all of the fake CGI in a lot of movies in recent years, and it made the movie more enjoyable as a whole. I was worried, after being someone who had played the Need for Speed games, that there would be no real story line in the movie, but I was glad to be proved wrong. If you're looking for a movie that will win awards next year, this probably isn't the movie for you, but if you're looking for a movie that is entertaining, not extremely fake and unrealistic, then this is the movie for you.",Need for Speed

If you ever played one of the ""Need for Speed"" series games, you know what I mean. Speeding on abandoned roads or overcrowded cities with a lot of traffic, combined with a good soundtrack - this is a short overview of what the game is, but also this is what the movie delivers.I saw fast cars, adrenalin, good acting and a story.

They also trained the actors to drive like real stunt-men to make the feel more authentic. The story was very good and was not an excuse for putting a lot of fast cars into a movie. This movie made me love Aaron Paul even more and I wish to see him in many other movies and series.I also hope there will be a sequel to this movie or at least more NFS movies to come.The story was great, cars were cool and the actors were fantastic.Would recommend this movie to everyone!

Unfortunately, the spaceship they are traveling in collides with a massive rock and all of them die, except the lead pair. At the end male actor dies leaving the female actress with a couple oxygen cylinders. She survives and the later is history. Sounds similar to ""Titanic"" but complete different locations and new actors. Same happened with NFS.""Need for Speed"" - same old story. One of the lead actor's friend dies in a car accident and later for revenge and power they race at the end. New cars, New faces and new locations doesn't make any difference to ""Fast and furious"". One black guy in your team. What next? You will have an Asian guy in your sequel who is more intellectual than the lead actor. Wasted my break. Ohhh yeah, forgot to mention the acting skills of Mr. Aaron Paul. He is no different to Mr. Ram Charan (telugu actor). Not in look-a-like way, but in acting way.

I understand that being a 2 hours movie, it might be a little hard to capture the look-and-feel of the NFS franchise. But that is what makes a good movie great, does not it? I loved Paul Walker's Fast and Furious series and to me that was more closely related to the NFS game than this Need for Speed movie.

There are scenes in the movie that fans of the video game series will definitely take notice of, as well as some downright ridiculous ones, but what else would you expect from a movie called Need for Speed?If your'e a fan of the video games, or cars in general, I hope you can see this movie.",Need for Speed

350,jsrpatna,Makes you feel the same adrenaline rush which you felt during Game Play!,9,14 March 2014,"I had made up my mind to watch this movie ever since I saw its first trailer, last year. Though I was apprehensive about what the movie will contain, but within few minutes into the movie, and I was enjoying it. Back in my college days I used to play all releases of the game starting from the one where it was all 2D only. This trend continued only until the game was released on PC. Later on I continued it on XBOX. So, as you may think, I had very high hopes from the movie and I am happy to say that this movie did not disappoint me.A very strong and well thought story line, combined with great acting from the actors (I liked the cute British girl. She is a darling!), this movie was a treat to watch. Several scenes as you would expect were fully devoted to racing and the director has done wonderful job of keeping it exciting. In fact I could see several people lean forward in their seats during such scenes. 3D effects were not that significant but they did keep you more engaged in the scenes. Oh, another thing about the 3D version of the movie - you may feel a mild, sweet headache after this movie, because it somehow makes you feel a little exhausted! As if you just finished a racing or something. I hope I was not the only one.Drawback- Only one in my pov. When you do not see racing on the screen, the story drags at some places.

When I watched it at the cinema the whole time I was on the edge of my seat, this film doesn't give the viewer a moment to even bat an eyelid...which is what I love so much about Need for Speed.Aaron Paul is an amazing actor, and really shines in some particular scenes which is quickly making him on of my favourite actors. I'm always going to be a little biased about Aaron Paul from his performance in Breaking Bad, but this film shows him in a refreshing new light.So why not 10 stars? The only reason I deducted one was because of character development, and that is something most films need and personally I felt myself asking for a tad more of it. However, in hindsight this film isn't entirely about it's characters, and whether you're a car geek or not, you're going to love this film.",Need for Speed
352,c-langham,Excellent if you like fun.,9,26 October 2015,"When I first heard of the Need For Speed film, I was sceptical. There are plenty of cases where films have been made out of games and they have been genuinely atrocious. As well as this, as an avid Need For Speed player since I was only a young lad, I was desperate for the theatrical release not to pervert the legacy. However, after hearing good things from my friends, I decided to give it a go.Having watched and finished Breaking Bad, I found comfort in the casting of Aaron Paul - an actor I knew I loved. As well as this, Imogen Poots is gorgeous. In her comfort zone, where she can be who she actually is, a well spoken British girl, she seriously steals the show; a stark contrast from her unconvincing performance in 'That Awkward Moment'. The two of them work brilliantly together, forming a very real chemistry which was a welcome surprise given the type of film that NFS is. The band of supporting actors do a lot for the film also - Dominic Cooper is a very convincing bad guy and works well with Aaron Paul to create a tense and frosty atmosphere that suggests an eventful past between the two. In terms of the story, anyone who has played the games will be familiar with the basic premise: Man seeks revenge and can only achieve it by burning rubber. It's no Christopher Nolan classic that asks more questions than it answers, but it's linear structure, much like a Beatles song, doesn't over complicate things and lets you enjoy the ride. The visuals are beautiful, especially when you consider that no CGI was used. The driving is fast, precise and dangerous, but not absolutely preposterous like the Fast And Furious series. Humour comes in all the right places and everything about NFS gives the 12 year old boy inside of me an awful lot of enjoyment. Need For Speed is not going to win any Oscars, nor is it going to go down in the history books is a cult film. But what it will do, is plaster a huge grin on your face throughout it's duration. If you like fun, watch this film.",Need for Speed
353,clarke2794,Love cars? Love racing? Watch it!,10,15 March 2014,"Aaron Paul is quite the driver in this film. Weaving in and out of traffic while avoiding the police from catching him. This intense high octane racing and evading film puts Vanishing Point and Bullitt to our generation and shoots it up with steroids. Kid Cudi with the eyes on the sky helps Paul's character get to his destination in one piece. The movie is all around a thrill to watch if you are looking for fast cars, shot in beautiful angles with realism and no CGI. I must say being an owner of a mustang makes me feel happier I own one being that they really made this car look unstoppable. Tuner cars weren't a show in this film, yet exotic cars were throw in at the beginning and end. Crashes, drifts, and hard gear shifting made the races feel more enjoyable and kept the fans of the gaming series happy. This movie was a simple plot but hey what were you expecting? It's a car themed film; not so complicated. Between the classic muscle car racing scene, exotic koenigseggs scene, the mustang ripping through the cities, and the last exotic scene including the Bugatti and new Lamborghini Elemento makes this movie worth watching for car lovers. First person view cams of the drivers, side and rear angles and even angles of the drivers as oncoming traffic makes this film awesome. Go see it and enjoy the ride!",Need for Speed

The most obvious mistake to point out is that every scene has the same structure/formula so you're never surprised, it goes like this: they are trying to do something dangerous, they are close to death and barely survive. it goes like that for the entire movie. the second flaw is the music, and it isn't bad music, but the lack of music, in awesome car races you expect some awesome background music, but in this movie there is just silence except for a few seconds. Creating a car race should be easy, for example see Fast & Furious 6 when Dominic races Letty, they rev their engines, bad ass music starts playing and off they go. That is a race done right! my last complaint goes to some cheesy/bad writing/dialogue, but that isn't that important.My conclusion is watch this if you have nothing to do, money to waste and no expectations at all...",Need for Speed

This extra mile leads to failures more than successes. Based on the games; the movie was unrealistic and it seemed like the cops were very stupid but this is what it is.

The story itself was simple but that in combination with blazingly fast cars, beautiful locations, sense of humor, good actors and pretty hot ladies, the movie was absolutely joyful to watch. The movie was in 3D (and I would recommend 3D) which makes it even cooler to watch. And if you love screaming v8 and v12 engines this film is really something for you.

This was full of beautiful cars, beautiful people and beautiful scenes. i liked it what can i say I'm a car fan and it fulfilled all my needs. The sounds were spot on with all the cars sounding different and pretty accurate and the final race was worth the wait not to mention that Arron Paul and the other characters did a great job. Others have said there was not development but i thought there was. I grew to like them especially Imogen Poots; i thought she was wonderful. One could say I'm biased because I'm racing fan but not of need for speed; forza is where its at. Saying that this show is not at all accurate in the since of story realism but it is great entertainment and one should see for oneself! Hope the team that brought us this will bring more.

Just saying that to let you know how upset I am, but I needed to get it off my chest.The storyline: dead. I just can't believe that a movie with such a budget, with the whole series of Need For Speed video games behind its back (by the way, even they had better story lines) comes up with such poor ideas. Everything feels rushed, although the movies is 2+ hours long and do not really have any twists. Emotional moments leave you untouched. To name a few moments that really made me 'shake my head': - The girl who knows a lot about cars wonders, why they say that 900hp are a lot of power - ??? - Hummer going towards them to prevent the Mustang from passing just clears the way and goes straight into a rock. Task 1: Stop the Mustang - failed. Task 2: Avoid collision - failed.Actors: weak. Imogen Poots with her attempts at being funny, and the enormous amount of emphasis onto the fact that she has a British accent - upsetting, as well as her acting. The rest of the actors - they just don't look like some good drivers to me. Maybe I'm spoiled by the great (as I think) cast from 'The Fast And The Furious' movies, and I inadvertently compare Aaron Paul playing the 'super driver' to Paul Walker's character Brian O'Connor, but the drivers just don't persuade me.Realistic factor? For me as a fan of cars, I just can't stay calm watching the way they hold the steering wheels while driving at such speeds. Speaking of speeds, he tops out the Mustang at 234 right before a sharp turn on the circuit? Alright .. And also, a Shelby Mustang going 230+ mph (370+ kmh) easyly?

365,ndsingh9,Fantastic!!,10,30 July 2014,"I LOVED this movie, I really disagree with the folks here that are saying its a pointless movie and a Fast and Furious Rip-off, but that is their opinions, now here is mine. First of all; I have been playing the Need For Speed video game series ever since the first actual game, which was made 2 years before i was born, I have played every single Need For Speed Video game up until the most recent (Need For Speed Rivals 2013) And if anyone else had played this game series, they would better understand and love this movie. Secondly; This is a Game based movie that is completely action packed,you can feel the Characters Emotions it often had my heart pumping anxiously while watching, which makes it even better. The story could have been a bit better, but everything else is just flawless, Beautiful Cars I loved the fact that they had American Classics in the movie. Finally; The people complaining it's nothing like the Video game series except for the title, try playing Need For Speed Hot Pursuit, The Run, Most Wanted(2012) .etc and you will then fully be able to understand this movie, maybe even a little bit better. (In my opinion) I am really hoping for Need For Speed the Movie 2, 10/10",Need for Speed
366,troydeans,Wow.,6,1 December 2014,"Fast cars, intense action sequences.... what more could you ask for?? Cop chases. Oh, this movie has plenty of them as well. If your planning to see a movie for fun? Watch this movie. If your planning to watch a movie for very nice fast cars? This is for you. All whilst containing great action scenes?? This movie suits you best. ""Need for Speed"" does what it set out to do: entertain. And there was not one moment when I did not get bored. I am a lifelong NFS fan, and this film does not disappoint. 10 out of 10. Easy decision to make. All right, the acting isn't brilliant, but it really did not make that much of a difference: because the movie's fun and intense chase scenes and races make up for it so well that by the end of it, you've barely realised it. Let the haters hate: this movie is awesome. Don't let the one star reviews put you off: they have no clue. The movie was not made to have a high-end cast and promote perfect acting: the movie was made because someone liked fast cars very much. And this person made billions of dollars/pounds because they made a video game series out of them. And from that, came this movie. You might want to put your seat belt on: you are in for a heck of a ride.",Need for Speed
367,natalja-volkova,A product of quality,10,2 April 2014,"I am genuinely surprised at the amount of negativity ""Need for Speed"" is facing. Come on, this is not a character study as ""American Hustle"", nor is it based on an shocking and inspiring true story of ""Dallas Buyers Club"", still it is a quality product for a video game adaptation.Mind you, I have never played the game, I don't even have a driver's license, but I completely identified with the characters, I considered the plot to develop fairly logically, and I enjoyed the racing sequences immensely. What is more, in contrast with the Fast & Furious franchise the protagonists in this film are not criminals, they are not motivated by ""prize money"", robbing and enjoying the stolen wealth. They race for truth and justice in clear opposition to the sleazy money-hungry villain.Also, Aaron Paul's acting range is a lot wider than Vin Diesel's. He is allowed to drop the whole invincible alpha-male act that's associated with the image of a driver on screen, to appear emotional, vulnerable, in jail and in a car crash. All of it adds to the general plausibility of the film and you really get to feel for him.I wish the film to do well at the box-office and to grow into a full-blooded franchise, because I sure do want to see some more of Tobey Marshall, his crazy girl and his driving skills. And some more of the naked guy Finn, who has truly touched my dying accountant's heart! Amen.",Need for Speed
368,boonemccloud,"Average movie, nothing special",6,16 March 2014,"This movie is okay. A lot of the parts are predictable and some stuff that happens would definitely NEVER happen in real life and it just makes it disappointing and silly. If you're really interested to see if its better than the Fast and Furious series, I recommend seeing it but only to satisfy your curiosity. I'm not saying its worth your money. You probably won't feel any type of sympathy for any of the characters simply because everything just sort of happens too fast, despite it being a movie that's over 2 hours long. You won't even remember any of the characters' names after a day or 2, except for like 2 of them. However, the cars look amazing, so I guess if you like movies with REALLY nice cars and somewhat exciting races, I guess its for you. Aaron Paul gives a great performance even though the script was lousy. In the end, I give it a 6/10.",Need for Speed

We both loved the truly amazing stunts as well as the police chases and of course the explosions and car crashes. I truly believe EA really did put a lot of effort to pull this off.

The action and stunts were believable and not super overdone and cheesy. There was unexpected drama which is great because I really don't like to know the entire movie a quarter of the way in. The camera positioning during the races and driving scenes were awesome. You actually could see what was happening instead of a bunch of shots of gas pedals and stick shifts.Aaron Paul was great in the lead role.

It makes the movie more sentimental.I do think Aaron Paul does a great job in this movie. For some reason I really like Imogen Poots' performance as well. Toby is not the typical hero in action movies and Julia is not the typical girl friend of a super hero neither. The movie did not try to make her super hot.

For the critics, for a movie of this type it is at the very top of my list of the best i have seen. Unlike some critics I feel that the lead actor, Aaron Paul was great. Imogen Poots was more than ""the girl in the passenger seat"" and Dominic Cooper was a very good ""bad guy"". My wife and I plan to see it again as well as recommend it to our friends and associates. Aaron Paul is once again ""Breaking Bad"". Another great job by director Scott Waugh.I look forward to seeing more from the director and all of the actors involved. I feel that the negative feedback was not factual and was done to give other movies a boost and this movie a lag at the box offices. This movie was as good, if not better than any of the Fast and Forious movies. I have always read the reviews before seeing a movie but i intend to read less from now on.

This movie wasn't some amazing story line or thoughtful scripting, its just a cool movie with LOTS of driving bad-ass cars. It also has a very talented guy playing the lead role, in Aaron Paul. There were no sex scenes, no vulgarity. Just lots of driving and really cool looking scenes. I am a car guy, so I found this movie cool to watch and I hope they do another. It reminded me of the first and second F & F movies, when they actually drove cars in most of the movie.

383,jebrini-mohamad,Need For Speed is one of the most thrilling racing movies out there,9,1 April 2014,"I am a fan of the need for speed series since the age of 6, but I never expected a movie. now since the movie was released, remarked ""based on the game"", I highly expected the story and scenes to be identical to ""Need For Speed THE RUN "" title, on the other hand, it was a completely different experience.As almost all racing movies start, either by a bet or property at stake, Tobey Marshall(Aaron Paul) is street racing for $5K in order to fulfill his debts. After winning, he grabs back the attention of his ex- partner, Dino Brewster(Dominic Cooper), grants Tobey his lifetime offer of working out a special Shelby GT500 for a 25% share. Till here, the movie was sort of identical to NFS THE RUN, and then it sets on a new path of story. Tobey and Dino set a race for which the shares are swapped in case Tobey wins, which he doesn't due his friend's death that Dino caused. 2 years later, a cross country race, DE Leon, is launched with all the cars dedicated to the winner. Tobey joins, fueled by vengeance, after Dino's entry, forcing Dino to put everyone on Tobey's tail before Tobey gets to the race. later, Tobey wins the race, using Dino's Koenigsegg Agera R, and is the only survivor through.Overall, the movie is considered overfilled with well crafted stunts, especially when compared to the Fast and Furious series, which required 4 movies to get to such respectable stunts. Not to mention that I felt almost the same feeling as NFS HOT PURSUIT when racing at Mystic Lake Road. Unfortunately, the storyline seemed vague at some points which can be comprehended later through audience inference and analyzation, In my opinion, the movie was well built but, sadly, cannot be recreated.",Need for Speed

I had a fun time under the whole 2 hours. when the credits rolled I was very surprised because it felt like the movie started like 10 minutes ago. The most movies get a bit ruined with romance, but Need for Speed had it in a way that it doesn't feel like it's forced and it's not a distraction from the story.

It was based on a video game for crying out loud, but when the lights went out and I took off my 3D glasses I found my self quite urged to jump in my sad little Prius and driving as fast as I could. The movie was really well directed, the racing and action scenes looked realistic because of the lack of CGI in the film and the actors had to have extensive driving courses hence didn't have to use stunt doubles much. The movie had a predictable storyline but the movie still left me in suspense, laughing and vouching for Tobey (played by Aaron Paul) throughout the film.Its impossible not to compare the film to fast and furious but I think that need for speed was a lot better. Need for speed had a lot better cars that left my jaw dropping,the movie didn't have an excess of unnecessary unrealistic explosions like fast and furious. Fast and furious had a better cast but overall need for speed left fast and furious in the dust.Towards the end of the movie after Dino crashed and flipped over and Tobey went and saved Dino from the flaming wreckage and got back in the car and finished the race first while ""Roads Untravelled"" by Linkin Park playing in the background, I couldn't help but smile like an idiot.I really recommend this movie for anyone who loved the fast and furious franchise, loves cars or likes action movies.

Happy that this film has a higher rating on IMDb, this site must attract a cooler audience in my opinion! As a massive Fast and Furious fan, I was saddened to hear about the death of Paul Walker. Of course for him and his family, but I also that meant no more petrol-head films for me (little did I know!). Having said that, I was finding the ridiculous stunts in the Fast and Furious hexagoly a bit unbelievable. But then I saw the ad for Need For Speed and with Aaron Paul as the main character to boot! I told myself to not get excited and a friend told me they heard it wasn't that great. So I went along tonight, and mentally prepared myself to bend the rules of reality to accept the crazy stunts and to try and not compare it to Fast and Furious. Having left the cinema in a state of total adrenaline-pumped satisfaction, I truly felt the same way I did when I left the cinema for the first time after the Fast and the Furious all those years ago (just as another reviewer has also put - I hear ya buddy!). Also, there were only 2 stunts I had to mentally ""let them get away with"". But even the parts that were a bit ""if that was real life they would be dead"", could be forgiven because it is a movie based on a video game! Don't want to give anything away, but I was truly cynical before I went in, ready for the worst and I have left happy and ready to watch it again when it comes out on DVD!

And as a fan, I am always looking forward to all NFS projects. When the film adaption was announced. Fans were very concerned about that decision. Because, previous Game adaptions didn't live up to the excitement of the game. They included actor Aron Paul into the movie. Which got breaking bad fans on their feet. It gave the movie a little spark and more attention.The thing about the movie is that its very heavy and not at all flexible. It carries the typical revenge story line. The fruitful action and great performances by the actors give the movie enough juice to build up the momentum. The cheesy lines and Dragged story just leaves an after taste. The confrontation between Aaron Paul and Dominic Cooper is fun to watch. Aron Paul also proves that he is a lead man material and needs to be highlighted in other projects too.

Maybe a Koenigsegg can outrun a Dodge Charger cop car but it can't outrun a helicopter or radio. Well it can in this drivel. At the risk of sounding like a middle-age conservative, the manifest disregard of other road users' lives is distasteful. These guys would have been locked up for 12 consecutive life sentences if not shot on site. And then where did Imogen Poots get that idiotic put-on accent from? I can find only two redeeming features – the Mustangs are pretty (even if they mistake wide-bodies and Shelbys), nice to see the 2015 model make an appearance and I watched it with a fast forward button (which got used a lot).

Aaron Paul's acting is promising, the direction is good, screen play is fine, the stunts are good. However, it lacks that zest that NFS game used to give us but its not that bad either. The story could have been better and last race could have been more exciting and challenging. Overall the movie was fun, entertaining and awesome. There should be a sequel and they should ask the NFS fans about what they want in the movie and create story around those suggestions. Brilliant portfolio of cars is used. I won't say that its as good as fast series but it was an experiment that worked and I just can't wait for the sequel! Don't over-criticize guys and be fair with the ratings.

I'm a complete gear head and from that point of view it is sometimes not believable/possible, but I can get over that, since movies are made to entertain and show us things that are not possible in the real world. A very big plus to this movie is that no CGI was used for racing sequences, even though at times those were prop cars, but still, less CGI=win. Also I really liked Aaron Paul's performance, felt like he had a lot of presence in the scenes, and while he played a bit too gritty, his character kept me interested a lot.

First i didn't like the trailer, it looks.... well, i don't know, something inside me didn't like it. Then i saw some reviews, i got inspired from them and i decided to watch it. Very impressive , awesome cars, the best cast of actors ( well, for me) etc etc. Many of you guys didn't like it, but Why? This movie has everything, action, racing, drama, (funny scenes were the one i liked most)By the way, i wanted this movie to be longer , it wasn't enough for me, also i would prefer a different end but that was even better. Everything was perfect, i wont stop watching it again and again i don't think it will get boring for me.So , what i want to say is , I am waiting for another Need For Speed movie , i would like to see again this cast of actors if its possible :) , and more cars.",Need for Speed

I also thought that the film would have a fast and furious feel to it as it worked out so well for them but i didn't feel it, which is a positive. The story was extremely well made especially with all the curve balls that were being thrown in from start to finish. I would highly recommend this film to people that enjoy racing films although i did not feel that it was as good as fast and furious hence the 7 rating.",Need for Speed
401,pop27-73-808738,Got exactly what I came here to watch,9,6 August 2014,"An awesome racing movie. I didn't ask for an overly interesting (or distracting) storyline. The lines are said to be cheeky and cliché, I found them fitting and to the point, no bullshit. Talking about bullshit, this movie surprisingly toned down a lot of the uninteresting and typical car-movie clichés (overly focused love-stories and revenge plots), distracting what this is really about.. which I am grateful. Considering that, I find this movie superior to every Fast & Furious movie after the second one, as I simply can't stand some of it's annoying typical drama that the producers feel they should put in to make the movie applicable for most audiences. And the racing.. is simply mind blowing. Stunts were real, actor were driving for real, traffic were real (sort of), crashes were real... I almost felt as tense watching the behind the scenes stunts as the finished ones on screen. This is exactly what I wanted to see, and I was unequivocally surprised. To the haters: Reconsider you square dogmatic supposition of what a movie is.",Need for Speed

The plot was very intriguing, the cars were beauties to look at, overall this was a spectacular movie! I really enjoyed how quick the plot moved along. Every single scene was highly interesting and I was always waiting to see how much better this movie could actually get. I admit, the soundtrack wasn't that great but the plot certainly made up for that.If you're not a car fan, I wouldn't suspect that you'd like the movie very much, so that's probably why many people are giving it such terrible ratings.

The film is based on the video game by the same name .Tobey Marshall, a custom-car builder and street-racer, spends two years in jail for a murder he did not commit. The murder was framed by Tobey's former rival Dino and the person who was killed was Tobey's best friend Pete. Getting out of prison he reacquires the fastest car his workshop ever built and sold ""Ford Shelby Mustang"" with which he wants to win a secretive and extremely high-stakes race known as The DeLeon. His main purpose of joining the race was to avenge Pete's death. Before the race starts, he loses his car but he soon acquires another car ""Koenigsegg Agera"", the lost car with which Dino murdered Pete.The movie comes with crashes and car chases. It features some of the fastest car in the world like GTA Spano, Bugatti Veyron, McLaren P1 and Saleen S7.",Need for Speed

Then there's no disappointment. I would have to say in my own opinion that the movie was pretty sweet. As a long time follower of the nfs games, i gotta say its exactly what i would've expected. Alittle drama, and then a lot of sweet rides, nfs type breakdowns (horses running, then shatter cg). All in all, both me and my gf enjoyed it from start to finish. Even made me want to play nfs rivals again once the movie was over, just for s&g's. So if your into the nfs game series, im pretty sure this is very reminiscing, even for a movie.

405,rod3101,A wasted 2+ hrs. of my life!,1,19 August 2014,"I like a good car movie just as well as the next person, but, this movie is a joke. The worst acting(if that""s what you call it). Does anyone remember ""Vanishing Point"",""Smokey & ""The Bandit""(good movies). This movie does not compare to them but they sure used a lot of the same ideas(only so much time to get to a certain place or your screwed, and the radio ""DJ"" being the middle man). Michael Keaton should have stayed in Gotham City! They could have grabbed any ""crackhead"" off the street and got the same acting ability(as Keaton) he acts like an imbecile, and the others aren't any better. The best part of the movie, in my opinion, came at the beginning with the ""GTO"" ""CAMARO"" & the ""TORINO"",(not impressed with millionaire toys) after that it was all down hill. I have been waiting for this movie to come out on disc so i could buy it(without seeing any previews) paid $25 for Blu-Ray copy, really got ripped! I did not like the audio(as with most movies today) you can't hear what they are saying because of the loud cheesy back ground music(i do not hear music when i'm speaking with someone) then when something happens the volume is so loud your ears bleed, and that is supposed to make the movie exciting? All it does is make ""E-N-T specialist more money and make a movie annoying! If they would have cut out all the meaningless scenes(taking 30 seconds to make a split second decision) the movie would have lasted in my opinion about 90 minutes or less. The best thing to do in my opinion is buy the video game ""NEED FOR SPEED"" and make up your own story line. Who knows they may make a movie out of it.",Need for Speed
406,raphael-godart,This IS Need For Speed,10,23 August 2014,"This is my very first review for a movie here and actually, anywhere else... So it will probably feel very amateurish. I'm writing this review for those people who know and enjoy the Need For Speed gaming franchise. I played most of the Need For Speed games and very much enjoyed this film. It exceeded my expectations a lot. After every film I enjoy, I browse to IMDb to read what other people think about it. And this time, I was very disappointed by how the majority of the people perceived the movie. I'm not sure what the rest of the world expected, but this is a Need For Speed movie, and as a Need For Speed gaming fan I can tell you this: this movie LOOKS like Need For Speed, FEELS like Need For Speed. This movie IS Need For Speed! Everyone involved in making this movie did a amazing job in converting the Need For Speed gaming franchise into a movie franchise. I've never seen such a perfect conversion before. To all of you involved in making this movie, THANK YOU! You did an amazing job! A lot of scenes just give you the same feeling as when you're playing the game, with a summum during the race towards end of the movie. The performance of the actors is very good. I didn't know Imogen Poots before this movie, but people, what an appearance an performance! The look on her face and eyes just bows you away! I also very much enjoyed Aaron Paul's performance. The emotions he expresses during the whole movie, and even more towards the end of the movie are mind-blowing. Thank you for this movie!",Need for Speed

I loved Ronin with some crazy race scenes, I even enjoyed the first F&F movie when it first came out but this thing is horrible. they didn't even try to make it realistic. I know usual would be boring but this is beyond boring, following someone delivering pizza would have been more fun. drivers are almost never buckled, and even if they are they are using stock seat belts from the kit cars they used I assume. most of those cars have at least 5 point harnesses. and so called race car drivers are holding the steering wheels like they are sitting at red light going to morning commute. engines sound very much fake, could have done much better with this. if they wanted to make a movie around super cars and racing they should have listened to some pros and got some facts before they made this, its garbage.",Need for Speed

Its not the fact that there were exotic and American muscle cars racing, i like that it was about a guy who was out to prove his innocence and he made it happen. The commitment and loyalty in this movie is truly amazing as well. I do have to admit it does look like they were trying to copy The Fast and the Furious, but i would say they are about the same but with different qualities. I really hope that another Need For Speed movie comes out because i would probably be the first one in those theater doors to buy my ticket! My rating on this movie is a 15/10.

Mainly towards the end of the film when the final race has commenced the fact that the Lamborghini keeps up with the Koenigsegg down the straights and even catches it is pitiful and annoyed me more than it should have. The Lamborghini having a 560BHP V10 from a Gallorado (however it's spelled) and keeping up with the Agera r with nearly double the BHP is complete crap. Of all the cars the Lamborghini should maybe have come last because of the fact that it has the least power and lowest top speed, though it is light the race seems to be just many long straights.",Need for Speed

Also you have a character easy to relate, with not a really developed personality, just like the one in the game.Also you have your typical rival, with a dumb villain name that frames the main protagonist, cop pursuits, iconic cars, city races,multi boss final race, i mean that's basically need for speed.So yeah didn't really got all the hate for this movie, to me it was a really close adaptation to maybe carbon elements on a most wanted plot.",Need for Speed

This movie isn't going to win any Oscars, but it's at least reasonably entertaining (though the wronged protagonist/revenge/victory plot is obvious, that doesn't make it a bad thing). Predictable, sure. Would I stand in line to get a ticket at the box office, no. Worth 90 minutes of your time for some action/relatively light comedic entertainment?

If you are looking for a reviewer who has played through every game in the series, then read this.To be honest, when I first saw the trailer, I thought it was going to be a typical cash grab film based on a popular game series. After watching it, I was very happy. They managed to add in everything that was enjoyable within the games. Fast cars, High speed police chases and good looking girls (Yes I think tthat Julia is on par with Nikki, Mia and Rachel). I don't care what anyone says, The characters are likeable but not fuly developed, which is understandable as its based on a video game, the humour is decent and the plot is enjoyable in my eyes. The only thing I wanted from the feel were little things that would have given the film a more NFS feeling, Such as the iconic chase musicand more ephasis on building and tuning the car at the start (Not spoiling make/model).Overall, The movie is solid.I have watched it multiple times and I will keep watching it in the future as it is better than what I originally expected it to be.",Need for Speed
