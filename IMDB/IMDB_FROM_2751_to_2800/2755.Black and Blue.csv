0,SnoopyStyle,some flaws but still good,6,11 January 2020,"Rookie cop Alicia West (Naomie Harris) is returning to patrol her childhood New Orleans neighborhood. Her body camera records narcotics detective Terry Malone (Frank Grillo) executing his drug dealers to hide his drug deals before a coming wave of investigations. Malone and his police accomplices pursue West through the devastated neighborhood as they seek to eliminate the body camera. She finds help from reluctant local Mouse (Tyrese Gibson).This has good potential. It has some deep flaws but it is still able to pull off a thrilling crime drama. First, modern communication is an overwhelming enemy of this movie. West should radio in her situation after the first two gun shots. Her radio should still work after Malone intercepts her transmissions. When she gets Mouse's phone, she should be calling everyone and anyone. Couldn't she call 911? The easiest solution would be a POS malfunctioning radio and Mouse not having a phone. Once somebody has cracked the body cam, it should be much more simpler to hand it over to a TV station than a police station. When West kills the gangsters, she should check the car. I'm assuming that the director missed a scene there. West is trying to hide and she should really change out of her police blues. Despite these annoying flaws, the movie still works with some good thrills.",Black and Blue

2,kosmasp,Who can you trust?,7,15 March 2020,"Some things are not meant to feel bad. Certain people should be there to protect. But while this is quite predictable, it also has a suspense to it, that makes it entertaining. The backdrop is a serious one and having a colored cop is a statement.The action and the stunts are good, the overall flow is nice too. This has social commentary written all over it, but does not forget about the entertainment factor. It's not flawless by a long shot (no pun intended), but can be worthwhile for fans of the genre and those who like messaging like this",Black and Blue
3,Quinoa1984,"a slick, mostly timely cat and mouse cop thriller that is perfectly OK",6,25 October 2019,"Deon Taylor isn't the best director of B movies that are being released on thousands of screens, but he is... *a* director of them, not totally without some measure of competence and among the three Screen Gems movies he's helmed over the past two years, Black and Blue lets him show what he can do with a more-than-competent script, with shades of... May I be high-minded and compare to High Noon? Only this time the law is asking for help from the public to protect from murderous lawman, so maybe that and a large sprinkling of David Ayer in Training Day/End of Watch mode. In other words, it's not as good as those films, but it's no disgrace by any means either.Plus, he has actors in Harris and (yes) Tyrese Gibson ready to flex, on top of a chewing-the-set-via-gold-teeth Mike Coulter. This is not to say he's made a giant leap into being 'Someone To Watch', yet when his previous flicks were the insufferable Traffik and sorta-passable-because-of-Quaid The Intruder, a hard-boiled programmer (after a long day of work no less) was what the doctor ordered... Up to a point.Sure, it certainly has its faults at points, including a couple of story contrivances in order to make a couple of lame message/wrap-around points (including one where Tyrese happens to get some, uh, I guess payback, but I wonder what happens right after his character does that to the, oh, nevermind). But it's got well-directed action, some tense set pieces involving the cat and mouse on-the-run dynamics of West vs Everyone, not to mention boiling hot topical themes and issues that resonate under the surface - which is always a plus in a B movie of this kind - and the locations add much credibility as it was all filmed in parts of New Orleans that many coming down for a vacation or such would not ever go to.It still feels like a slick Hollywood product, though with some varnish and a depiction of poverty and crime that isn't in something people watching can't or wont recognize. It's not fun bad, or something one will remember a year from now, but it can pass 90 minutes well enough (and an enthusiastic black audience helps).",Black and Blue
4,zardoz-13,"Tense, Nerve-Racking Crime Thriller",8,3 November 2019,"A rookie New Orleans cop exposes corruption within the force in ""Traffik"" director Deon Taylor's white-knuckled cop versus cop thriller ""Black and Blue,"" starring Naomie Harris, Mike Colter, Frank Grillo, and Tyrese Gibson. Most protagonists have enough time on their jobs before they bite off more than they can chew. Fresh out of the police academy with top honors and two tours of duty with the U.S. Army in Afghanistan, Alicia West is surprised by the reception she receives in the Crescent City. Although she is an African American, everybody who grew up with Alicia in the hood cannot see past her badge, so she wrestles with an acute identity problem. They treat her as an enemy! Worse, she wears a bulletproof vest with POLICE emblazoned across it, and this alienates them, too. Alicia's childhood friends want nothing to do with her because she has betrayed them. Sadly, this is the last thing the idealistic West (Naomie Harris of ""Moonlight"") imagined would handicap her. Winning their trust back seems impossible. Unlike his earlier contrived, half-baked melodramas, specifically ""Traffik"" and ""The Intruder,"" Taylor has stepped up his game with the 108-minute, R-rated, ""Black and Blue."" First, he has assembled a plausible cast, toplined by Harris' straightforward but sympathetic performance. As virtuous as our heroine is, the villain must be utterly vile to provoke an audience. As the corrupt undercover narc who aims to ice the rookie, Terry Malone (Frank Grillo of ""Avengers Endgame"") is unforgettable and constitutes a pugnacious adversary. The best action thrillers boast a brutally despicable foe, and Grillo's Detective Terry Malone will make your blood boil. Mind you, not only must West triumph over the murderous Malone, but she also must dodge a lead hailstorm laid down by the Ninth Ward's black gangsters. Second, Taylor has done an excellent job of painting his vulnerable heroine into a corner that appears to spell her doom. Watching West wage war on two fronts against overwhelming numbers of good and bad cops as well as hordes of trigger-happy hoodlums makes ""Black and Blue"" an edge-of-the-seat experience in suspense and tension.As ""Black and Blue"" unfolds, Alicia West is jogging through a suburban New Orleans neighborhood dressed in a hoodie and sweat pants when suspicious cops roust her. They are surprised as much as she is about their treatment of her. Although it doesn't qualify as an auspicious start for West, this incident ignites the suspense and tension that galvanizes this female spin on Antoine Fuqua's ""Training Day"" (2001). West's racial identity and wardrobe type casted her as a suspect in the eyes of these two, middle-aged, Caucasian cops. Later, at the police precinct, West suits up with her gray-around-the-jowls, thirtysomething, white partner, Kevin (Reid Scott of ""Venom""), who plasters his locker with family photos. Kevin briefs Alicia about their beat in the infamous Ninth Ward, one of the more unsavory in the hurricane ravaged remnants of New Orleans. According to Kevin, the police don't enter certain vicinities unless they are accompanying a Special Response Team to rescue one of their own. Kevin stops at a grocery store for coffee and snacks, while Alicia chats with an African American youth fooling around with his cell phone. When she tries to strike up a friendly conversation, the lad assures her the phone isn't stolen. As she tries to minimize his fears, his aggressive mom, Missy (Nafessa Williams of ""Brotherly Love""), warns Alicia to leave her son alone.Alicia realizes that little about being a cop in the 'Big Easy' isn't 'peasy.' Meantime, Kevin and she are amenable because each treats the other with respect. He babbles about his family and his upcoming date night with his wife. After they return to the precinct, Kevin rhapsodizes about his date night plans. Suddenly, he learns he must pull a double shift. Instead, Alicia volunteers to take the extra shift. If the first cops she encountered on her jog were surly, the cop she is stuck with is definitely hostile. During their patrol, Officer Deacon Brown (James Moses Black of ""Logan"") takes a personal phone call and drives to an abandoned factory building. Ordering Alicia to stay in the car, Brown checks in with a confidential informant. Impatiently, our naive heroine enters the factory and witnesses a dispute between Malone and a black drug dealer that turns into cold-blooded murder. Malone and his accomplices are just as flabbergasted by her sudden appearance. Since she is wearing a body cam, Alicia has recorded video of the murder. One of Malone's dirty cops wastes no time pumping Alicia full of lead. The hail of bullets catapults her backwards, and the impact propels her body through rotten floorboards so she plunges from the second floor into a pile of debris. Alicia's body armor protects against the bullets, but she loses her pistol. Frantically, she escapes while Malone and company search for her. Malone wastes no time framing Alicia for the murder of the drug dealer and then telling the kingpin drug dealer, Darius (Mike Colter of Netflix's ""Luke Cage""), that she shot his nephew!Most of this synopsis occurs in the ""Black and Blue"" trailers. Alicia becomes the object of a widespread manhunt to retrieve her body cam and permanently silence her. Desperate, alone, and wounded, our beleaguered heroine contemplates few available options. Comparably, Alicia's plight recalls Ethan Hawke's dilemma with Denzel Washington's dirty cop in ""Training Day,"" but Alicia isn't as fortuitous as Ethan Hawke's character. She finds herself trapped between a rock and a hard place. Nobody wants to help her, until Milo 'Mouse' Jackson, (Tyrese Gibson of ""Four Brothers"") reluctantly steps up. As a wary, low-key kind of guy, Tyrese Gibson gives a surprising but rewarding performance. Meantime, the villainous Malone has done a painstaking job of convincing everybody, including a doubtful Captain Regina Hackett (Deneen Tyler of ""Logan Lucky""), that Alicia is homicidal. A tense, fingernail-gnawing thriller, ""Black and Blue"" resorts to outlandish antics before its volatile finale.",Black and Blue
5,view_and_review,Awesomely Intricate Police Movie,9,4 November 2019,"A Black female police officer witnesses a Narc officer gun down an unarmed Black man-and she got it on her body cam. Now this Narc and his buddies cannot let her live and they definitely can't let her download her video footage onto the police database.Alicia West (Naomie Harris) is a Black officer assigned to police some of the most crime ridden and depressed parts of New Orleans. She looks like the people who live there except for one monumental difference: she wears a uniform and a badge. So, regardless of her race she is mistrusted just as much as the next cop.They really set the tone and drive home the point that there is a distinct line between the people and the police and she is essentially ordered to recognize that boundary and told to plant her feet firmly on the side of team blue. Her fealty is immediately put to test when she witnesses the murder. Will she uphold the law and turn in her video footage to the proper authorities or will she protect her foul police brethren?I liked that this movie wasn't simply a cop shooting an unarmed Black man and that's the extent of it. There were many facets to this entire matter. The victim was a drug dealer but it didn't complicate the issue for Alicia as far as right and wrong. The only complications for her were avoiding the corrupt police that were after her while trying to find a citizen that would lend her a helping hand.While Alicia was ducking, dodging, running and hiding she couldn't find a place of refuge. No one wanted to help her and it wasn't simply because she was a cop and I hope that fact resonated with viewers. What may have been missed, but should not have been, is that her being a cop was a part of the reason people were turning their backs on her but it wasn't the only reason. No one wanted the problems that would have come with aiding her. Whether those problems came in the form of some drama occurring in their home, undue heat from the crooked police, heat from the gang members, or even heat from their neighbors wondering if there was now a police asset in their midst. There were many reasons not to help Officer West with few reasons to help her.Milo (Tyrese Gibson) found reason enough to help her even if it was against his better judgment. What he suffered through afterwards were just the things everyone else wanted to avoid.Besides the dynamic multi-faceted story of Black cop comes home to a depressed and forgotten city where cops are as much the enemy as Katrina was, the movie was incredibly intense. I think the intensity came with knowing and understanding that incredible dynamic. If that simmering situation doesn't strike a chord with you then nothing else that happened in the movie would matter much. It was necessary to understand the environment and atmosphere for anything else in the movie to have the desired effect.This was the 9th ward of New Orleans. A place hard hit by Katrina which never fully recovered. The police barely police at all in some sections and whatever policing they do is daft and heavy-handed. Alicia is a prodigal son of sorts. She's returned home after a long hiatus but her return is not welcome because she is one of them. Also, she's a new officer, only three weeks on the force, so she is still learning the ropes and doesn't know the police code. In other words, she's not fully vested in either world. This is a picture that's made up of many strokes and each stroke is important. With that understanding, everything that occurs to Alicia and even the people in that ward has an elevated intensity. And because of that elevated intensity there was no need for Alicia to be a superhero that could dodge bullets and beat up any aggressor. It was anxious enough just to see if she could survive the next minute.I thought the movie was marvelous. I wasn't sure what to expect going in. I thought it might be some cheap, poorly thought out, Blacks v. police piece. It wasn't that at all and it was great.",Black and Blue

8,westsideschl,Litany,5,2 February 2020,"First few minutes started as a litany of why (either by implication or lack of counter examples) all white cops are scum.
First, our white cops stop a black female jogger for questioning because of a suspicious black in the neighborhood; second, they slam her against a fence for no reason; third, when they find out she too is a cop they act rude & condescendingly abrupt w/her; fourth, in a convenience store parking lot they ignore possible illicit activity because it's part of the 'hood; fifth, they ignore the clerks' mention of having reported a break-in 24hrs. earlier w/no police response; sixth, on the store's tele is a news story of the local New Orleans police charged w/corruption, stealing evidence, filing false reports, extortion; seventh, our white cop proceeds to take some food from this store w/out paying for it. Yes, those things happen, but to present it as if that's the sum of their (white cops) efforts & character made believing what was to follow totally incredulous.

10,cruise01,So so of a thriller that has nothing to offer.,5,22 January 2020,"Black and Blue (2.5 out of 5 stars).Black and Blue really focuses on the tension and the social themes like police officers and how they treat civilians from their skin color. Or how certain people are misjudged. But then the film also put these officers in an area that has been impacted after the hurricane in New Orleans. An area where the low class people are innocent and struggling to live a good life. While there are gangs and drug dealers owning the area like it is their own. Black and Blue has some good concepts and a story that could have been so much more. But fails with a boring direction, dull action, and a script that fails to capture the attention.The plot follows a rookie police officer Alicia (Naomie Harris) returning to her old hometown in New Orleans. She gets judged by her friends she grew up with about her being an officer. And when she is jogging around her new neighborhood. She gets pulled over from officers which they accusing her of being ""lost"" in the wrong neighborhood. Until she tells them, she is an officer. On patrol one day, she witnesses her own officers killing an unarmed drug dealer as they are wrapping up loose ends with them. She recorded the killing on her body cam. Which captured Narc officer Terry (Frank Grillo) and his men finishing loose ends. She is on the run from her own officers and drug dealers. When Terry puts a bounty on her head that she murdered the drug dealer.The plot is nothing new or special. A good officer on the run from corrupt police officers for witnessing their crime. Alicia gets help from her old friend Milo (Tyrese Gibson). Which they fight through corrupt officers and thugs. The plot is nothing memorable about it.The direction is dull. Some decent action and tension. Once Alicia witnesses what happened. The film does not stop there with its tension that she can not trust any patrol officers and avoiding calling for help. Noamie Harris did great with the character. While everyone else was just tedious with they're performances like Tyrese Gibson, Mike Colter playing a drug dealer, and Frank Grillo playing the villain.Overall, Black and Blue is not as good of an action thriller. The plot is boring. The direction is predictable and tedious. The action is nothing worth talking about. It was entertaining but nothing special about it.",Black and Blue
11,Fella_shibby,Decent thriller with sufficient tension n action.,7,31 December 2019,"The film is a about a female cop who goes on the run after she witnesses a murder. The plot has been done umpteenth no of times.
Cops burning 50 percent of the confiscated drugs n they sell off the remaining 50 thru their dealers n when things get heavy they try to cut loose ends.
The best part about this film is Miss Moneypenny's acting. The star cast is decent, we have Frank Grillo n Tyrese Gibson.
Grillo must be tired doing the same kinda roles but he is good at it.
It was so good to c Gibson aft long time sans Fast n Furious.Director Deon Taylor gave two good slasher films: 7eventy 5ive n Chain Letter but his Intruder n Traffik weren't good.",Black and Blue
12,matthewssilverhammer,Color Me Disappointed,3,3 November 2019,"Get Out was the best film of 2017 for many reasons, not least of which was its powerful ending. In a matter of a few seconds, it captures America's struggle between the black and cop communities with immense creative grace and emotional class. Black and Blue does the exact opposite. With no clear point-of-view, it serves to only propagate the deep divisions within our culture, without having anything of nuance to say about it. What the pontificating and insufferable John Q was to the American healthcare system, Black and Blue is to police corruption.
When a rookie cop has her body-cam capture corrupt cops killing a drug-dealer, she becomes stuck between the warring factions of the lower-class black community and the police. When the chase begins, the film has an early-90s Saturday matinee feel to it, with some solid thrills and surprises. Unfortunately, that suspense is short-lived, buried under cartoonish villains and even an inability to get the basics of storytelling right.
Worse yet, I don't think the words ""subtlety"" or ""subtext"" were ever once understood by the filmmakers. Without exaggeration, at least 90% of the dialogue is an incessant diatribe on something we already know: systemic police corruption is bad, and the black community has suffered most from it. If the movie trusted our awareness of this, it could've spent more time on developing its characters and plot.
As for the morality of the film, my stance as a highly-privileged white man should be taken with a giant pile of salt. However, the film's biggest problem may be its disinterest in having an opinion. To stay bipartisan, it unintentionally demonizes all sides; it's hard to imagine people from either camp walking away feeling happy. It's a shame because I think there's a good movie to be mined here, but this isn't it.",Black and Blue
13,marmar-69780,black and blue,3,28 October 2019,It has similar style to training day but its not even close to be so good also i dont think this type of films are for this time we live now,Black and Blue
14,paul-allaer,"Should've been titled ""The Body Cam""",6,27 October 2019,"""Black and Blue"" (2019 release; 108 min.) brings the story of rookie cop (and African-American) Alicia West. As the movie opens, we are in New Orleans, and West, just 3 weeks on the job, is pulled over by white cops for no reason whatsoever while jogging in a nice New Orleans neighborhood. ""She's blue"" comments one of the white cops after doing an ID check, and they let her go. Later, West is paired up with a new partner while doing a double-shift, and after responding to a distress call, West accidentally enters an industrial warehouse where she witnesses the killing, execution-style, of a drug dealer by an undercover cop. Her body cam has filmed the whole thing... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film from director Deon Taylor, who just earlier this year also brought us ""The Intruder"". Here he brings us a tense cop drama where it appears that every single cop is rotten to the core, but for one (Alicia West), and West has to figure out a way to survive being hunted down by the cops AND by the drug dealers. So who can she trust (other than herself)? The movie is tense from the get-go and really doesn't let up. Beware: there are some scenes where West is brutally beaten up by a drug lord, and the audience in the theater where I saw this audibly gasped (as did I). The movie is carried by British actress Naomie Harris, playing the Alicia West character. I have no idea where the title ""Black and Blue"" comes from, as the central theme is whether West can bring her body cam to a safe place, exposing the rotten cops. In that sense, the movie should've simply be called ""The Body Cam"". Please note there is an excellent electronic score, courtesy of composer Geoff Zanelli (he also wrote the core for ""The Intruder""). Bottom line: ""Black and Blue"" is certainly not a bad movie, but it does suffer from over-simplification, as it moves around like a bull in a china store (all cops are bad!!).""Black and Blue"" opened wide this weekend, and based on the trailer, I was interested in checking it out. The Saturday matinee screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended well (mostly by African-Americans, I might add). If you are interested in a gritty if over-simplified cop drama with an excellent lead performance from Naomie Harris, I would readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Black and Blue
15,subxerogravity,The message was loud and their is a good movie under it.,6,25 October 2019,"It's one of those movies made to pull at the emotional strings of a certain audience. Everything about this movie was niche to black folks tired of police brutality and this movie is all about justice for those who get none. Every single scene will have you shouting at the screen if you know what if feels like to be targeted by the cops cause of the color of your skin.
The point that they were trying to make registered, but the movie was not bad at the same time. It Had some good action, very suspenseful and I especially liked Nomi Harris and Frank Grillo as the opposing sides

This is a cop thriller with a rookie cop vs bad cops. Naomie is the rookie cop that winds up in the wrong place, where a drug dealer is meeting some dirty cops. Things go from bad to worse when the bad cops-led by Frank-kill the unarmed dealers in cold blood. Naomie gets the whole transaction on her body cam, which starts a dangerous game of hide & seek with her hiding and the bad cops seeking her and her body cam. To make matters worse, Frank puts out the word that Naomie did the killing and the dead dealers uncle-a big drug dealer himself, played by Mike-puts out a bounty on Naomie's head, so just about everyone is after her; good cops, bad cops, drug dealers, drug dealers' friends, etc. Tyrese plays a local store owner that is about the only person that will even try to help her get her body cam footage to someone that can be trusted to put it to good use. There is not much new here-as far as plots go-but it is executed decently.

The ActionThe VERDICT:Overall, Black And Blue is going to be the movie that will appeal to those that love a politically fervor movie with attitude and aggressive visualization of key events. It's got the emotional aspect to it, brought to life by the cast, setting, and suspenseful game of hot potato that is a key factor. For Drama lovers and crime lovers this is your bread and butter movie of the week so far, but for action lovers well hold your horses. The political component is the one you have to prepare for, because it is going to be the key factor that is stretched out, slow, and a little bloated. I'm not sure how people will respond to the painstakingly obvious issues and dialogue, the stereotypical roles and the portrayals of the cast. For me I would have liked better story, more developed aspects of the film, and certainly more excitement to help amp up the suspense.

26,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Black and Blue,8,13 April 2020,"""It was the cops that shot me"". Oh really. That's gotta stink especially if you are a cop.Anyway, 2019's Black and Blue is the be-all-end-all of dirty fuzz thrillers. As something about a rookie policewoman who witnesses a corrupt, execution-style death on her body cam, ""Blue"" is high energy, highly volatile, thuggish, and nastily dangerous. No one is safe in this movie and that includes the audience, the ""Crescent City"" denizens, and the venal NOPD (New Orleans Police Department).Granted, Black and Blue is implausible, remorseless, and far-fetched just like every other crooked crime caper. I mean the beating these personas take would put any other doughnut eater in a wheelchair. Still, you can't deny ""Blue's"" relentless prowess that hits you like a darn sledgehammer. You want a more down and dirty version of Training Day, Street Kings, and/or 2015's Run All Night? Well Black and Blue will give it to you. And do want to see the flick that 21 Bridges wished it could've been? Well you got it threefold with ""Blue"".The cast of Black and Blue is especially solid. That includes the tough as nails Naomie Harris (she plays rookie Alicia West), the Dante-like Frank Grillo (bad cop Terry Malone), the snarling Beau Knapp (he's always snarling), and the unrecognizable Tyrese Gibson (did he gain some weight?). Their characters respire heavily as the defiled, New Orleans landscape ingests them whole.All in all, Black and Blue's plot unfolds into a New Orleans shootout that turns into modern day Beirut. It's the po-po versus the kingpins, Naomie's West versus the above the law trigger men, and West versus the thugs who have a torrid price on her head. You can smell the bullets and as a viewer, you won't be able to breathe. Rating: 3 and a half stars.",Black and Blue

33,Richie-67-485852,COPS-ROBBERS & YOU,10,16 May 2020,"This is quality first rate entertainment. Who doesn't like cop movies? Cops gone bad? Good cops? Drug dealers? Guns? Mix it all up and you got a tense, fast moving, gripping cop do or die movie for those that love the genre. That's why this is a ten because it delivers! A cop gone bad is doubling frightening experience to everyone mainly because he hides behind the power of a gun and badge. The benefit is always given to a cop no matter what and that is why bad ones plan out carefully everything they do knowing that they can get away with most anything until that moment when they don't. This movie has us wondering if they will or wont and the viewer wants to see comeuppance, justice and closure so bad your nails get bitten waiting to see it play out. Add a drug dealer or two who has nothing to lose, money guns, drama and I am sure you get the picture here. Nice message of joining the military and straightening out your life too. BTW...what really makes this movie work is the truth of it all. People who live in poor areas know that what is in this movie is what they see and live everyday. Its real and any good that get enter in or bring change to their daily lives is more than welcome. Its called hope. Enjoy!",Black and Blue
34,rockman182,Black and Blue (2019),7,26 October 2019,"I feel like Frank Grillo was just destined to play a villain in films. Its quite obvious that the film was going to have very ever present societal undertones as cops and acts against Black people is something that rears its head ever so often. I don't care much for making comments on what a film is trying to say about society especially with a controversial stance. This film was a surprising one. Plenty of action and suspense that is held firmly in place by a great performance by Naomie Harris.The film is about a rookie cop who goes on an assignment with a veteran officer. Things take a turn when she witnesses that officer involved in a shooting of a street peddler. This involvement shows the corruption within the police department on the body cam that the officer had on her during the crime. The corrupt officers now try to chase her down to get that body cam, even if it means killing her. She must escape from them and rely on people of the streets with brings forth a series of complicated events.I think Deon Taylor's films have been mostly miss than hit recently. Mildly enjoyable but forgettable. I think this was his strongest effort to date. Its message gets muddled but its well acted and the action sequences are done well. The film is an entertaining thrilling chase. In that regard its a fun watch. Naomie Harris gets another chance to show off her talents and she grounds the film with a gripping authentic performance.The last act could have possibly been done better but I wasn't that bothered by it.When you strip away its stance on police brutality and its relationship to black lives mater, you have a well made corrupt cop thriller. Nothing to really write home about in that category but a solid venture. You get to see actors like Frank Grilo and Tyrese Gibson take on longer important roles. Black and blue won't have a long lasting impact but take it for its entertainment value and you will have a good time.7/10",Black and Blue

Yeah, it's not ""Amadeus"", ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" or ""The Godfather"", but still, it's not a waste of time, either. Really. It shows a slice of life no one should have to endure, and I've been through quite a few places like this in my life in NY and LA. They're nerve-wracking, gritty, drug-infested, and you never know if you'll live to see tomorrow. ""Black and Blue"" captures that hopelessness well, so recommended.",Black and Blue
37,abisio,Do not miss the movie; is far better than expected!!,10,28 October 2019,"I was really intrigued by the trailer but the expectations were not high; another formulaic woman action thriller with some racial tones; but I was really really surprised how the story was handled.
West an African American rookie cop from New Orleans that witness some narc corrupt cops kill a young boy in execution mode. As her body camera was one, the corrupt policemen try to get it but after shooting her. She manages to escape and is framed as murder and chased by cops, corrupt cops and gangs.
That's pretty much the story; but how the tale is told is the good part. In the beginning she is jogging and detained by two white policemen. The starts by showing white vs black racism but quickly moves to the black vs black or perhaps blue vs black racism.
We see a community that see each side of the equation as enemies. There small scenes when an store owner ask about the robbery that police never answer but we see black people do bad things also and worst of all everybody seems to hate each other or at least be afraid.
When West try to reach out her own people; she is rejected because being a cop and considered a traitor on her community.
When she tries to clarify things with the black gang boss about being framed; she is hit and tortured until being able to prove she is not lying. Same color does not mean trust.
Basically Deon Taylor shows a very difficult situation were everybody is guilty and doing the right thing is very difficult.
Naomie Harris is excellent as West and Tyrese Gibson is incredible good in serious almost coward role of a person trying to be decent in place is not possible. Both are the soul of the movie.
As the bad guy Frank Grillo delivers and interesting diatribe of how politicians ruined New Orlean after the hurricanes but then forced justice on the low end when there were no food, lights or even water. As always the social problem is quite bigger than skin color.
In brief; it is very good thriller with very realistic action and keeps you in the edge of your seat for almost two hours; but makes you think on top of entertain you.",Black and Blue

This is a tight lean movie carried by Naomi Harris who does excellent as a warm hearted police officer who rose out of the poverty she now polices. In reality, I wouldn't have cared about the story line, but as Ms. Harris is capable of powering through any story line and dialogue she has to face, I was enthralled with this film.

Amazing places to shot. Second, the acting is quite acceptable even sometimes there are some unbelievable situations. Third, the casting is pretty aceptable. I like Grillo as a dirty cop. It always works.
On the other hand, the script didn't work here. It makes sinking the movie by itself. The story is the same that other movies/series. To add, no plot twists and everything is extremely predictable. A shame because with another script the movie could have been much better.
So, overall an OK cop thriller. No more. If you want to watch a good thriller with the same topic well developed just go for Seven Seconds series. Enjoy! Life is not black or blue.",Black and Blue

Especially the uniformed cops. Really made you hate them. Production on this film was spot on. Location scout nailed it. I really liked where the story takes place. Gritty pour little neighborhood on the outskirts of New Orleans. Great choice for a story like this. One thing that bothered me was how Milo gets into the police station and uploads the video so easily. I just can't see that happening in real life.

Despite two sleek performances by Naomie Harris and Tyrese Gibson, Black and Blue soon descends into the norm.
By no means a bad film but it soon runs out of traction causing interest to wane.
Gibson has rarely been better and Harris proves she can lead a feature film but the script soon turns into the generic action chase movie with cut and paste gang leaders and corrupt cops.
It's a movie that will most likely disappear from public consciousness before it has a chance to shine.

49,ginocox-206-336968,A few drafts short of a finished script,3,31 December 2019,"Black and Blue (2019) is a muddle of familiar tropes, underpinned by a muddled message that might be ""It's okay to target police because most are corrupt anyway"" or ""Vigilante attacks on police could target the wrong person, but if enough officers are targeted, you're bound to get the guilty party."" The movie is a bit like a frustrated child who is angry, but can't express why or with whom. The various subplots are resolved in a massive deus ex machina scene that makes as much sense as the rest of the film.It isn't entirely clear who the protagonist is. One assumes it was intended to be rookie (innocent lamb among the wolves) officer Alicia West (Naomie Harris); however, if one considers the protagonist to be the character who undergoes the most growth or the character who personifies/delivers the message of the film, she doesn't quite make the grade. That distinction would go to Darius (Mike Colter), the big fish in a small pond drug lord.The actors do as well as could be expected with the material provided. Production values are more than adequate for a low-to-mid-budget film. Most characters are not entirely three-dimensional. In bookended scenes, Alice visits the tomb of her mother, who seems to have died peacefully of old age and has nothing to do with the plot, but doesn't seem to have a life outside of her job. Darius and Mouse Jackson (Tyrese Gibson) are perhaps the most fully developed characters. Police bodycams are central to the plot, but greater clarity as to their operation might be helpful.",Black and Blue

Top Nark Terry Malone (Frank Grillo) needs to get that Body Cam to protect him and his men, and shoots at Alicia West and she is wounded but gets away. The police spread out to find her.There is a lot of suspense and tension in this story as we watch Alicia West avoid the cops who may even kill her to get that Body Cam. She runs into a store owned by Mouse (Tyrese Gibson) who she knew back in the day when she lived in this area, and he is reluctant to help her.This is a good cat and mouse scenario and the tension and suspense builds all the way to the end of the movie. The kicker is that Malone puts out her picture that says West killed Zero, a nephew of Darius (Mike Colter) a drug lord and this causes Darius' men to also go after West. This can't be good.Notables: Reid Scott as Kevin, West's partner; Nafessa Williams as Missy, a one time friend of West back in the day, but now runs with Darius; James Moses Black as Sgt Brown, who takes West on patrol, but tells West he has to see his CI, and tells West to stay in the car, but she hears gunshots and leaves the car. West must somehow get her Body Cam to Captain Hackett (Deneen Tyler) who can be trusted not to be a dirty cop.This movie surprised me as to how good this is.

57,huh_oh_i_c,Excellent first attempt is virtually without plotholes,10,31 December 2019,"Overall this is a good movie, and since this is based on a book by a first time writer, and the filmmakers were obviously trying to stay true to that, it has some problems.
This movie is a straight up action movie, with some social commentary. It's not too deep/profound/layered, because the problem it describes, police corruption which hurts pre dominantly black communities, isn't all that overly complicated either: It's the powerful (white communities, white men, white voters) taking advantage of their privilege. This isn't rocket science, it's a story as old as mankind.
All the white male reviewers should stop slashing this movie as simplistic for its "" hilariously inept"" villains, because guess what: corrupt cops aren't all that bright. They abuse their big advantage they've got, which is that no-one questions their actions, they can openly kill anyone with impunity provided they only kill PoC and white trailer trash. They behave opposite I.A. like a maffia with their ""blue code of silence"", this is simply Omerta, which many groups have. This neither makes for complicated nor intelligent criminals. I guess the writer wrote what she experienced.The movie is about a rookie black female cop, Alicia West (excellent role by Naomi Harris), who witnesses a brutal execution of young black male by a white narcotics cop (Frank Grillo, in true Bad Guy fashion). She records this on her body cam, and the fight over the body cam becomes the focus of the movie. It's Alicia West against a whole bunch of corrupt cops, with just one friend, store clerk Mouse. They want to kill her and destroy the video of the murder, she wants to upload the video as evidence.Now, 'some' (AKA white males) deem this movie as having stupid villains, maybe because they wanna stand up for white men, but it has far fewer suspend-your-belief moments than any other white male dominated action movie. West is good at hiding, her competence is credible because she's an army veteran from Afghanistan ánd she's got home advantage since she grew up in the neighborhood. The villains are at a disadvantage because they can't let the rest of the police dept. know that they are hunting for the body cam. That the corrupt cops manipulate a drugboss called Darius into hunting also for West, is quite believable. That a young kid betrays West to drugboss Darius after her picture is spread via social media falsely accusing her, is a great reminder that most stuff on social media is false.Would it be more realistic if West had been shot and killed in the first few minutes? Sure, but by that standard, no movie could ever be made.This a virtually plothole free movie. The only thing which is maybe ""off"": Why didn't Wests friend, store clerk Mouse, when he was tortured by Darius, reveal that it was the cop killed Darius' nephew, not West? But even that could be explained, perhaps Mouse knew that Darius would not believe him. When West did reveal it to Darius, she could back it up with hard evidence. So, for dramatic purposes, it is better if she, and not Mouse made that reveal.The other thing is the ending, which is unrealistic, in the sense that justice is served. Never in a million years would this be the outcome in real life. West would be discredited,or killed, or would not have the guts to stand up to the white cops, which is probably for her own good and very understandable. But this is a movie about hope, because marginalized (and frankly, oppressed communities) need hope the most. They can't afford yet another depressing experience where justice is trampled. That is already their life.10/10 The Melancholic Alcoholic.",Black and Blue

It's a 5 star movie with a 9 star message so I've agreed to a 7! 😁I really wanted to like this movie because I support the message especially after what has gone on in our country during the last week. I fully support the message of this movie because police across our country have let there minimal authority and power go to their heads and too many American citizens are feeling their wrath. I have been through it myself so I have no respect for the majority of law enforcement. They're all dirty and all on power trips!Anyway, I just had several problems with this actual movie and it could have been better.
1.) Please tell me why in this day and age with cell phones everywhere this female cop couldn't get an f'n phone to use to call IA or even her police chief? Why she gave up using her police radio!?
2.) There is ZERO chance that dispatch is going to ignore her cries for help over the radio because another dirty cop says ""oh she's just a rookie that saw something disturbing, I'll handle her!"" Dispatch replies back with ""oh good, you know I have plenty other things to do!"" (Or something stupid along those lines)
3.) Why didn't Tyrese's character call the main gang leader guy (that he knew) and tell him that the female cop didn't shoot those boys and that they had video proof of that? Would that not have kept the gang from coming after her and instead got them going after the dirty cops?
There were just too many ""oh come on"" moments that detract from the message this movie was sending. It just got to be really irritating. The viewer was just asked to suspend belief one too many times. I realize that doesn't help make the movie or keep things rolling but the stupidity of she and Tyreses actions were so distracting from the message.They could have driven the message home without all the stupid mistakes and unrealistic plot.

She had the most obvious scared look on her face, and just should've used common sense. Her character lacked it. She should've seen how dangerous they were, but nope! She was clueless. Then in the alley, she stands there for a few minutes after the gangsters almost kill her and mouse! Lol. 🐁 HAHA!

Lol. So, she stands there for a few minutes and im shocked the dirty cops didnt get there as they heard the gun shots. Whatever. Then in the bathtub, she could've explained who actually shot the cousin. Same with mouse, but they choose to be dumb and take abuse?! Did the writers make her that dumb or was she acting like that?! Also, her face annoys me so i couldnt enjoy the movie. It had potential but whatever. Also, The Black girl with the braids and 10 year old son, is she related to the female cop or mouse?! I was confused who she was related to. Whatever! The film had potential but the writing, acting and maybe the casting of the female lead ruined it for me.",Black and Blue

I cannot wrap my head round why anyone can hate for colour. Some of the stories have broken my heart over the last year, I mean even in the world right now in a pandemic people still manage to make it worse. I hope one day everyone lives equal and happy, irregardless of gender, race or anything your born with.The film was fantastically acted except the skinny guy who shot the cop and the guy who she rode with, I thought they had no presence and poor delivery, the tension, build up was great, although the realisation that this sometimes mirrors reality can bring you out of the moment and into sadness",Black and Blue

She always delivers the goods and is well worth watching in whatever she is in.She plays a tough rookie cop who is in a very corrupt department. Cops are executing people, dealing drugs and whacking anyone and everyone who gets in their way. As an Army veteran she is not buying into any of this corruption.After she records a murder on her body cam she is marked for death by just about every cop in town.

73,helenbassett,Black And Blue Film Review - Deon Taylor Directs Naomie Harris In A Tense Cat & Cop New Orleans Action Thriller,10,6 November 2019,"Deon Taylor directs Black and Blue, a tense cat and cop chase, with Naomie Harris as a rookie cop. After two tours of duty in Afghanistan Alicia West, three weeks into the job is back in her hometown of New Orleans, and already racially targeted by officers when out on a run one day. But she has a tight relationship with her partner, Reid Scott's Kevin, as he explains she is now Blue, when her old friends in the area no longer recognise her. T'hey only see the badge. She's too black for the job, but too blue to be black. And the police only respond to this area if a blue is in trouble. No wonder there is so much tension.Offering to do a shift that evening for Kevin with fellow Officer Deacon Brown, played by James Moses Black, his unorthodox policing saves Alicia's life. But responding to a later call, Alicia hears gunshots and follows him into a disused factory, witnesses a shooting. Which her body camera records. The unarmed kids were drug dealers and the shooter was Terry Malone, a narcotics cop on the take played by Frank Grillo. His partner Beau Knapp's Smitty is trigger happy and takes Alicia out.The cops only want the camera, but when Alicia manages to escape they have to come up with a story. Rookie Alicia the rookie panicked and shot the boys, one the son of the local drugs kingpin. And Mike Colter's Darius is not happy. Molone spins him the line and every Brother gets the shoot to kill text.Injured and with nowhere to go Alicia stumbles into the back of the local grocery store run by Milo Jackson. Alicia knew Tyrese Gibson's Mouse from way back, but he doesn't want any trouble. Pressing the panic button when he heard the noise out back brings the cops, but after a breathtakingly brutal incident with them, he agrees to help Alicia. She needs to get back to the precinct to download her camera. But when Deneen Tyler's Police Captain, also a black woman, floods the area with blue, the stakes and tension are raised even higher. Black and blue are both after her. And not all of them are friendly fire.This is the first Deon Taylor movie I've seen and the action is fast moving through the mean streets of this brutal landscape. Alicia may have one foot in each of the camps and she doesn't care that the boys were drug dealers. They were unarmed and unlawfully killed and the corrupt cops should be brought to justice. With terrific performances by Naomie Harris and Tyrese Gibson, Black and Blue was violent, and very impressive.",Black and Blue

75,Exiled_Universe,An awesome movie!,9,12 February 2020,"So before i saw this movie i thought it was gonna be basic and stuff and since frank grillo was in it which i love him by the way, i thought it was gonna be another basic movie but after seeing it i realized that it was better than i expected, it was different from other movies and ive heard of it but never really payed mind to it once i seen the trailer a while ago and when i heard about it. This movie relies on suspense and buildup rather than action but there is action and its good. Another thing i like is the ost soundtrack during moments of suspense it sounds pretty cool and scary. The plot is basic yet very complex with multiple problems at times and also at times there is more than one problem happening at the same time which is a common occurrence especially in films like this but it all pans out in the end. The ghetto street approach is something new and i dont mind it its pretty cool and it makes the movie look good. The acting and cast was great as well as the whole story. I loved every second of it and i really enjoyed watching it from beginning to end.",Black and Blue
76,FixedYourEnding,"Solid movie, but nothing earth-shatterng",6,21 January 2020,"Alicia (played by Naomie Harris) is the Rookie protagonist cop dealing with a highly corrupt Police precinct in New Orleans, a place that has to deal with the after-math of Hurricane Katrina and the lack of support from government. The hatred between the black community and the police force is immense. Although Alicia is from the inner-city herself, this is does not help her too much with crossing the water, as she is seen 'Blue' in the eyes of the local community.The story does not deal too much with the psychological situation in New Orleans and instead gives us a solid action flick of a cop being chased by corrupt police members on one hand and gangsters on the other hand, almost to the point of unbelievability, which unfortunately takes away for me the social message of this movie which could have been stronger.The ending is very predictable and done in a very Hollywoodish fashion (lots of shooting, face-to-face with the bad guy at the end etc.) so nothing very new here.

When Alicia witnesses a murder committed by her colleagues she has no one to turn to. Her predominantly white fellow policemen consider her a traitor and the black population doesn't trust her blue uniform. All she has to do is run... Structured in almost real time, 24 style, BLACK AND BLUE is a relentless thriller about an underdog running scared with the world crashing down on her.Brushing swiftly on the grim situation of racism in America BLACK AND BLUE is popcorn entertainment at its best. A tad predictable, it plays its cards safely, nevertheless it doesn't make it less of a guilty pleasure. Naomie Harris as Alicia is particularly good, playing her character on the subtle side but is believable when she has to make split second decisions. The baddies are a bit of a letdown, with Mike Colter (Luke Cage) in a supporting role owning the screen. It's a shame the script has limited him, he could have lifted up the finale big time.We all crave guilty pleasure from time to time, BLACK AND BLUE also succeeds in making you think.

83,frank-liesenborgs,Welcome to America!,7,5 November 2021,"""Black and blue"" starts promising. Movie kicks off with police corruption and racism on the beats of ""Welcome to America,"" Usually I like the acting performances of Frank Grillo (Malone) but did not like what I saw here. As opposed to the acting of Naomie Harris (Alicia West) and Mouse (Fast and Furious Tyrese Gibson) which was very much appreciated. Too bad that the trailer gave away key plot points and therefore no major surprises throughout the movie. First time I have to admit that the title of the movie is a perfect one. The moment Alicia West realizes she is blue, not black.The chemistry between Naomie Harris and Tyrese Gibson is palpable and well executed. Felt very natural. The movie flies by which indicates it is a good one. I loved the chase scenes and the constant tension but also the abundance of ""quiet"" scenes with all their own discussions.The quietly played scenes made also an impact, not always the cat-and-mouse pursuits. It's the quietly played scenes that prove most memorable after the end credits. In one, a young black boy, convinced of West's guilt, points a gun toward her. I will remember ""Black and Blue"" as a typical cop thriller with only brief insights on the racial and social issues. America today (November 2021 as I am writing this) did not change a lot and is still heavily polarized. But I did enjoy the movie and would recommend to watch it.",Black and Blue

89,michaeldoud,First Hit: An engaging drama made good by powerful scenes and excellent acting by Naomie Harris as Alicia West.,8,3 November 2019,"First Hit: An engaging drama made good by powerful scenes and excellent acting by Naomie Harris as Alicia West.West is still considered a rookie cop on the New Orleans police force after three months of duty. She's an Army veteran with two completed tours in Afghanistan and is not afraid of conflict. She had recently joined the department because she wants to make a difference in her hometown.Her partner Kevin Jennings (Reid Scott), drives around and introduces her to areas in New Orleans. As he passes various neighborhoods, he points one out and says, we don't ever go in there, unless it is to help a cop.
She voluntarily takes an extra shift and heads out with veteran cop Officer Deacon Brown (James Moses Black). He makes it clear that he isn't wearing a body-cam and not to film him, ever.Getting a call on his cell phone, Brown and West head to a vast empty manufacturing plant. Brown tells West to ""stay put,"" while he meets up with an informant. She hears shots, leaves the car, turns on her camera, and goes into the building. Following voices, she witnesses undercover cops killing people, execution-style. One of the undercover men sees her and shoots at her wounding her in the side.She gets away and soon discovers that both the drug dealers and individual cops are out to get the camera and probably kill her as well.
The rest of the film is about her evading the crooked cops and drug dealers who think she's the one who shot and killed their team members.Leading the crooked cops is Terry Malone (Frank Grillo), who has been busting drug dealers, keeping half the captured stash, selling it through other dealers, and then killing them to keep them from talking. His primary enforcer is Smitty (Beau Knapp), who acts like Malone's mad lap-dog and executioner. If West's cop camera video gets into the Chief's hands, Malone and his team will be found out and prosecuted. Malone wants West's body-cam and would prefer West dead.The head of the local drug cartel is Darius (Mike Colter), and he's got a personal interest in who Malone's team killed as this last killing was his nephew. Malone tells Darius that West killed his nephew.Because West is on the run, she heads to her old neighborhood and is rejected by her former friends except one, Milo ""Mouse"" Jackson (Tyrese Gibson). Mouse works at a grocery store, and when West shows up, bleeding, and needing help, he reluctantly gives her assistance because she is an old friend.There are some wonderful scenes in this film, but the one that stands out to me was when West and Jennings stop at the grocery store to get a coffee.
Jennings goes into the store while West gets out of the police car and starts talking to a young twelve-year-old boy. The mother of the boy Missy (Nafessa Williams) yells at West and gets into an argument with her. West, recognizing Missy as an old friend tries to reason with Missy, but Missy disses her and tells her to shut the f*&% up. The layout of the characters, Darius, Missy, Mouse, Jennings, and West are well developed at this moment.Harris was outstanding as Officer West, who is trying to make a difference in her old neighborhood by seeing people, not color, or anything else. She's excellent in carrying this message and physically does a great job in this demanding role. Grillo is excellent as the crooked undercover detective. His intensity and attempts to keep everyone in line were perfect. Gibson was absolutely fantastic as the quiet gentle giant who ended up helping West escape all the people after her. Williams was terrific as West's old high school friend, who had been twisted and hardened by the neighborhood. Colter was sharp as the leading drug dealer in this part of New Orleans. He embodied the intensity and drive of a man protecting what he has. Scott did a great job of feeling caught between two sides as he knew of the crooked stuff going on, but was always the one just looking another way. Black was good as the tough cop turning subservient to Malone when required. Knapp was perfectly unglued as Malone's killing lapdog. Peter A. Dowling wrote a terrific script that created a high intensity by all the characters. Deon Taylor had everyone on the same page with his direction, and as I previously stated, some of the scenes were indelibly powerful.Overall: I really enjoyed this film and thought it was well written, acted, and directed.",Black and Blue

She is great in the film as well as our supporting players.The action scenes are chaotic and messy and sometimes resort to shaky cam but I overall found them for the most part entertaining. However the film has a problem when it comes to engagement.The movie for the most part is kind of bland, bland action and with a simplified version of topical issues it just feels pointless.

Ok writing, acting, and plot. The main character, Alicia West played by Naomi Harris, story was pretty good. At times, because of the directing, her acting wasn't believable. Also, because of the spotty development of the secondary characters, it was hard to have any empathy towards them. In contrast, great use of background aka mise-en-scene, to deliver a message to the viewers that are watching. Lastly, I do like the overall message of the film which is that we all are people (especially black people and other people of color) and all we want is to be treated as such.",Black and Blue

120,tomwoodland-96599,Decent but meh,3,2 January 2020,"The movie is decent like others have said but some parts are just silly...like her having a radio the whole time...she literally just had her partner walk into a building then moments later hears two gun shots which for all she knows could of been the CI killing the cop...but she calls it in? nope she just goes in herself as a rookie with no backup..then shes stood there filming it all but doesn't use the radio or hold the mic so cops heard them talking/gun shots at her? then when she finally goes on the radio why didn't she open mic while they were shouting things at her? then the dispatch randomly leaves the channel....which would NEVER happen especially after reports of shot fired etc, then the guy literally starts talking about what just happened to her over a open channel that dispatch was just on but conveniently left it...hows he know nobody is on it still? and all radio communication is recorded too.But even before all that, the cop took her with him and didn't think to delay the meet or say hey maybe use a suppressor? like he went in there knowing full well any cop is going to investigate gunshots right next to them so he knew she would come in searching...little silly moments that just made the movie dumb and unrealistic at times for me.Also, what sort of police force just hears a story and just believes it and instantly calls her a killer and makes her the bad guy? as if anyone especially a ""captain"" would believe a rookie rolling with an experienced SGT or whatever somehow turned up at a building that just so happened to have drug dealers in and she accidentally shoots them both? then ran off and he ""lost her"" but somehow their squad car gets lit up? so the dead guys shot at her cop car after shooting them? or the cop shot at her which makes no sense? like do you see what i mean...so many loop holes in this movie its hard to watch...also, love how they spent so long chasing her but somehow didn't think to check her location via radio? even bodycams have trackers in just incase they're stolen and evidence is lost...then theres a time where they shoot swat members with a serviced issue shotgun...like its just so hard to watch and not pause and think hmmm.Then Milo somehow bypasses finger print scanners or hundreds of cops that lets face it the movie makes it seem like most are dirty...and they knew she was on the run with Milo so you're saying not one cop recognized him? and even the good cops even they're looking to bring her in and know her personally so how did they walk past someone wearing a vest with ""west written on it"" and not say anything? then at the end her partner suddenly saves her? even though hes been trying to catch her and thanks to her he'll be doing time in prison and his life is ruined?I know all my review is just bad stuff about the movie but tbh i cant find anything good...sure the movie idea is good and the characters are okay i guess but it just wasn't for me, i dont expect 100% realism in movies but i expect them to atleast make sense.Can see people are crying about my review, sorry but i cant back a movie that i dont like..anyone who's over the age of 12 knows what im talking about..loopholes in this movie are just insane and makes the story unbelievable.",Black and Blue

126,kevinthecritic-15200,Black and Blue: Topical Premise Buried under Generic Action,3,4 November 2019,"2 out of 5 stars (has some good moments, but is overall bad)Black and Blue is a frustrating kind of bad movie. It hints at exploring a hot-button topic (police brutality and corruption), but uses that topic as an excuse for repetitive chases and shoot-outs that seal its fate in Redbox machines everywhere. Black and Blue has decent acting and passable production values, but its mishandling of a complex subject matter leaves a bad taste in the mouth.Army vet Alicia West (a solid Naomie Harris) has been a cop for 3 weeks. Outside of her partner Kevin (Reid Scott), the other officers look down upon her optimism, and the low-income inhabitants of the surrounding area only see an untrustworthy police uniform. When Alicia's bodycam catches 3 officers (Frank Grillo, Beau Knapp, and James Moses Black) shooting unarmed men, she sets out to upload the footage at the police station. Now pursued by seemingly every cop in New Orleans, Alicia turns to streetwise friend Mouse (Tyrese Gibson) for help, uncovering a greater conspiracy along the way.Black and Blue is a generic thriller with hilariously inept villains and a tension-shattering soundtrack. Naomie Harris proves herself ready for more leading roles, but the script is loaded with contradictions, illogical character choices, and bland action that buries any potential commentary and exits your memory once the credits roll. Black and Blue fails as both a fun action movie and a thoughtful drama, muddying up a complex societal problem instead of exploring it. I pray Naomie Harris gets better material in the future and that movies like this be forgotten by all but the Redbox machine. Skip Black and Blue.Rated R for Violence and Language",Black and Blue
127,growns_up,Surprised at low rating,9,5 February 2020,15 mins in and I knew this was going to be a great movie. It is non-stop and doesn't let up.

I wish there was a bit more about what justice was served to the corrupt cops though...,Black and Blue
128,john-monne,Naomie Harris made it and broke it,4,10 January 2020,"This movie is worth watching i think, its not a B movie its not an A movie, its somewhere in between. Most of the acting is ok, settings are ok, most of the scenes are ok. Heck even the sad shaky cams are not what really breaks this movie. The story is standard and nothing new. In that perspective this movie is just some light entertainment worthy of watching while ignoring the misplaced and ill performed corrupt cop agenda. Dont get me wrong, there really is a corrupt police story to tell in this world, this just isnt it and this just isnt the way to do it.What breaks this movie for me is... sadly Naomie Harris. Its an odd sensation as she both makes and breaks this movie. She sometimes is down right acting great, while on other times she comes across so much out of place that it breaks the movie. I find her a beautiful strong woman but she just doesnt cut it for me. Even more so concerning her voice. Any volume higher then whispering just breaks her voice and makes almost every dialogue scene with her feel as if she is over reaching, as if she was shouting all weekend and now she dropped in to do the scene. It feels off, breaking tension and deducting from it. But that might just be me. I as well didnt like her in the James Bond, there as well she felt out of place.",Black and Blue

Good cinematography.Obviously the filmmakers wanted to drive home May economic and racial injustices but the brow beating makes it less a social commentary and more an eye rolling after school special.Dialog comes off like a junior high student wrote it and there is ZERO understanding of police procedure or even how a body camera works.Literally every bit of dialog is a statement of exposition and nobody talks the way people in this movie do. NOBODY.This movie wishes it was Training Day 16 Blocks or End Of Watch. Sorry. Not even close.I really hate seeing good money and fine actors being thrown down the toilet.

Every single white, male police officer in the film is an evil villain/a coward. The only black male cop is also portrayed as such. The only two good cops in the movie are the lead (a black female), and the captain (a black female). (There are no white female police officers). The film also positions evil criminals, murderers and drug dealers, as being better people than the police. This is a deeply offensive movie. It is despicable, and it is propaganda at its worst.

It all feels so on point with the state of policing today! But then sadly, so very sadly, this racially charged beginning turns into a paint by numbers chase movie.It looks the part, you feel the grit and dirty streets, the production is solid but it's failed by the ham fisted dialogue. Characters feel hollow, behaving in the strangest ways in the middle of a frenzied life and death chase. Visually this is in no way a B movie but the dialog tips it into that zone!

Not a dull moment throughout , great acting and great cast. Really well made action.Undoubtedly the movie had flaws that ruined some parts including annoying behaviour at parts of the lead character that didn't make much sense, and implausible moments such as someone standing near yet doesn't hear the radio device...

163,jaka6052,Boring,4,6 January 2020,"As discussed in other reviews, the social problems in poor American suburbs are the overarching theme of this movie. In my eyes the film did an exceptionally bad job portraying those. The racism aspect feels so shoehorned in just to give the movie some imaginary dept and it doesn't work. The real world is nuanced, people are not either good or evil, they have their own motives, fears, goals etc. The movie never explores any kind of complexities, it's just black and white. Of course ""black"" and ""white"" are switched around to peddle the illusion that the movie has some kind of deeper thought. Don't be fooled.All the characters are extremely one dimensional, we learn nothing about the backstories, it is completely left out. It is basically wild west logic, bad guys are bad, good guys are good. And some people are caught up in the middle. At first I liked the little twist, that the police officers in the car turned out to be ""bad"" as well, but then just five minutes later they do the exact same thing again. And now we are at a point where there are only TWO ""normal"" people left. Is this what the movie tries to tell us, that there are these two fractions fighting on the street and if you are neither you are basically a hero? Everybody else is either a gangster or a corrupt cop. And not that the corrupt cops have some shades, no. They are basically ready to kill to prevent that some distant colleague is caught for his own murder?! And like I said at no point is mentioned why they have such incredibly strong ties to each other, which only leaves the conclusion that whoever wrote this must think that this somehow represents real life.
The final scene where of course the African-American community sees that there are indeed some good cops is ridiculous, the scene is already so forced that it made me cringe and then they even top it of with some dumb moralistic dialogue.The story is very weak and some plotholes are so big that it took me completely out of the focus (Why in does she never call her captain?). The are so many coincidences (Mobster Boss son just happens to be a hacker) that the writers had to use to glue together the poorly written script. The visuals are not the worst, however it is obvious that they tried to imitate the artsy look of some ""film noir"" movies and failed. The acting is decent, however there is one scene where Naomie Harris cries out in a side street which is ridiculous. All in all, no recommendation from my side, however, there are far worse movies out there, therefore I conclude with a 4. I would give the movie a 6 for the action but way they tried to build the story on top of real and important social issues led me to detract 2 points.",Black and Blue

173,djdrew103,They don't have 6.5 stars which this movie certainly is worth if not more.,6,31 December 2019,"It would have received more from me if only the writers of the movie, not the book, would have followed the story-line and had followed the story of the book more closely. The actions sequences which some chose to denigrate were in my book, action packed and well done, choreographed, correlated and accurate with little if any goofs in timing or cut/paste accuracy.The first part of the movie was perfectly aligned, with little time wasted on character development or story scheme presentation. The story in whole was well put, interesting, attention grasping and well played.In an era where correction officers in West Virginia in the academy are caught sitting one-and-all in a class group and 100% are giving the Nazi Hi-Hitler salute along with three training officers, a script like this based on a factually presented story put it in a perspective that we all should accept as real.It made a believer out of me in like comparison to true stories such as Walter Scott's murder by a cop, Micheal Slager who got 20 years for murder, with 5 cops writing false reports to lie and try to allow the officer to get away with it, but those who had the courage and righteousness stood up for the truth and allowed the judicial system to put that cop in jail.The old saying that there are more good cops than bad still rings true, but the more those good cops stand up for and falsely enter fraudulent reports and lies to protect the bad cops, the faster those numbers of good cops decline. If they wish too retain respect and honor they need merely to righteously stand up against the bad, not join in.This is only one of dozens of example stories in recent years of cops murdering suspects. So the story was well played as I said, its content real and authentic, and any condemnation of the movie for other than merely opinion purposes only goes to prove how rancid society has become racked with hate and racism.",Black and Blue

Never have I seen cops and police working together to through text messages to put a hit out. All I'm saying.
This movie also makes it look like the police will just jump on anyone's agenda per request and say to heck with everything else. We're gonna go hunt another cop because we were directed to.. This movie was a knock off training day. There are several scenes that just had attempts of being great written all into the narrative. This movie was boring. Predictable.

Do a little research and you will find that the NOPD has a long history of corruption. I rate it a 7/10 based on the movie outside of the message.

The storyline turned out to be quite unrealistic and not very ambitious. Furthermore the story is quite predictable, and as it is not marvel movie, I found it amusing how many blows and injuries characters could withstand, shake their heads and keep on fighting.

As a value the experience of going to a theater, sitting down, and eating popcorn, sometimes it's fun to watch a mid-budget thriller rather than the heavier genre fair.Despite the topicality of the premise, which sees Naomis Harris police officer, witness the execution of a group of African-American drug dealers by some corrupt cops, the film doesn't expect to much from the audience. The movie doesn't question the nature of policing except for a couple of lines and the evil cops are portrayed as a few bad apples. Still, points for portraying Mike Coulter's drug dealer more sympathetically than Frank Grillo's crooked police officer.Still, if you like mid-budget action thrillers this movie is for you. The heroes are likable, the villains are hatable, there are some genuinely suspenseful scenes, and the obligatory scene where Frank Grillo has to explain his motivations is well done.

The acting of both Tyrese Naomie Harris was breathtaking. There was no overacting, it all seemed natural and in sync. The storyline was not very original as this has been done numerous times like in 16 Blocks however they did add some originality to it separating it from the rest; can't say what so as not to give a way any spoilers. The pace was fast, action all the way, a bit of reality and fantasy in the script and movies; police do pull black folks over for no reason; it has happened to me so I know.

The horrible movie with spoilers:The stupidity of the the entire movie. The entire timeline makes absolutely no sense. It literally crumbles the movie to dust.Next are quick point outs to stupid things in no particular or linear order;
Alley kidnap scene- They see him, but don't see a burning crashed car with dead people and their target yards away walking down the same alley while looking in her direction?
-She could've have literally stayed in one spot for a day until real incorruptible authorities searched for a missing cop
-Tyrese tells a bum they'll be open soon, she arrives, the police mess with him, and suddenly he's coming home and she's there? What was he cleaning the ghetto liquor store until the AM, well after ABC forces a store to close? (Part of the whole timeline)
-she couldn't find a single phone in the world to call IA or a way to send the camera or a file to them
-half a dozen cops are shot at the final ho down and she finds a court yard circle with only armed hood guys, and no cops, already formed in a circle to fall out of a window into?
-Cops and people were killed and a captain isn't on the scene but behind the desk and magically a certain body cam pops on HER PC(by liquor sore boy knows how to suddenly use police computers to do everything) and she can magically end it all with a quick call when guns are pulled and the scene is chaotic.
The original cop car she was in had the corrupt detectives one of a kind Chevelle on the dash cam when the thief tried to steal it (the car was running) and her phone with GPS (it still works when dead) was in said car (all of which couldn't been used to help her case)-A massive police force doesn't entirely go out SWAT style ALL OF THE SUDDEN for an officer wanted for a murder connection the don't even have a case built up save for some radio calls from a two man detective crew
-LASTLY....everyone kept saying triple nine in reference to the detective squad!! 999 is code for officer down. The cops and the thugs called the detectives 999 because the writer was too stupid to research the radio code and heard it in another movie.
Again, the political bs in this movie isn't even worth meantioning.",Black and Blue

267,Greg_The_MovieMan,BET Movie of The Week,8,31 October 2019,"This movie was actually much better than I thought it would be. The acting from Alicia West was superb same with Mouse (Tyrese Gibson), and Milo (Luke Cage). It's a timeless tired classic tale of police corruption that never fails to entertain. Alicia West is a 3 week rookie on the New Orleans Police Department who unexpectedly witnesses her fellow officers execute two drug dealers and has it all recorded on her body camera. Of course her fellow officers shoot her to silence her, but she is wearing a bulletproof vest and gets away. The rest of the plot writes itself. We have all seen this scenario countless times before. Who can Alicia West trust? Where can she go? She is now the most wanted person in the entire city. You can probably figure out how this all ends.
Tyrese Gibson plays an amiable convenience store clerk who is Alicia West's childhood friend who is willing to help out anyone in need. He agrees to assist her to safety no matter the consequences.
The villain corrupt cops are your stereotypical idiots who feel they are entitled to illegal money and are righteously above the law. They have the upper hand throughout the entire time.
Overall this is a thoroughly enjoyable film which is bound to end up as the BET movie of the week in 6 months. If you loved movies like Training Day or Armored then you will also love Black and Blue.",Black and Blue

279,kahmalsealey,Faultless and true,8,24 January 2021,"Honestly this is a great film; not only for Naomie Harris' amazing acting, but also because it actively depicts the truth of many a black person's experiences with the police - albeit not getting a gun drawn on you and forced against a wall, but the endless racial profiling and often wrongful accusations that lead you to have a skewed opinion towards the police.What I particularly loved about this film however, was the way they showed the above. There was not an ounce of 'playing victim', you didn't feel as if they were showing black people's plight in a way to elicit sympathy; rather the complete opposite, it actually humanised police.(POTENTIAL SPOILER)
There were many a moment where you could see Naomie's character reaching out to the black community, as she believed that she was, rightfully, one of them. This culminates into her screaming at one point 'It's not us versus them, we're all people, I shouldn't have to choose' - which I think was so perfect and would allow some people to 'look past the uniform' and see the people and lives that inhabit them.The reason I haven't given this is 10 stars is fairly trivial, there for some bits that I didn't see the realism in - like someone being shot in public and no-one hearing to intervene but that's me being pedantic and highly critical of nonsense details.",Black and Blue

A nice depiction of the struggle of her being caught between two worlds. The acting is par for the course. Not sub standard, but not fantastic.A few things really took me completely out of the story.
1) When she calls over the radio and dispatch answers, then the detective cuts her off. She is still on the same channel. Dispatch and every other cop on the channel, including the watch commander would hear the traffic. She would be able to call for backup, unless the entire zone was corrupt, which given the way the detectives lie to the captain is not the case.
2) When the Narcs choose to switch to another channel so their traffic isn't heard by dispatch, Alicia somehow switches over to said channel by sheer plot convenience.
3) In relation to 1 and 2 all radio traffic is public record and recorded per Public Safety Telecommunication standards.
4) When Darius is tuning up Mouse, there is no reason he would only say, ""she didn't kill Zero."" and not add, ""Malone did and she caught it on her body cam.""
5) They make it abundantly clear that cops don't go into Kingston unless a ""blue is in trouble."" But if it's such a bad neighborhood, who is calling the 9-1-1 to say, ""There's a lady cop here."" It doesn't make any sense.",Black and Blue

317,allforapint,Morons rating this low give good movies a bad name.,7,1 January 2020,An excellent movie for those who are looking for something with action and suspense. Gripping to the very end.Ignore the low reviews and just watch it. You won't regret it.,Black and Blue
318,karencoleslaw,Everything flowed in this much vie,9,28 October 2019,Everything flowed for me in this movie. From the soundtrack which brought both high energy and suspense; to the acting...I especially love it when the lead female is in a very low key way; the length of the move which is about an hour and a half to the story which I could never predict!,Black and Blue
319,justinbigelli,Did anyone else find this oddly similar to training day?,5,25 October 2019,"Here's a list of exact scenes from training.1. Rookie cop gets partnered with a dirty cop.
2. Rookie cop whitenesses dirty cops doing a crime.
3. Rookie cop returns to the bad ""ghetto"" alone.
4. Rookie cops get thrown into a bath tub and almost gets killed.
5. Bad guys in the ghetto end up helping rookie cop.
6. Dirty cop gets exposed at the end.And this is only off my memory of training day that I haven't seen in well over 10 years. I'm sure if I was to watch it again I would have been able to list at mother 5 or 6 identical scenes.",Black and Blue

I really glad that i watch it while i was doing editing in photoshop and it wasn't 90 min just of watching such a naive, cheep and poorly made movie. Really sorry for everyone involved in the production, this work will be forgotten as it should.",Black and Blue

322,perryashford,Perspective,10,2 January 2020,"From a black man's perspective, this was on the money. I felt the opening scene, quite deeply. Other scenes were quite accurate from my point of view. Although there are good and some great cops out there we also have some very bad ones too. Well put together. Worth the time and money.",Black and Blue
323,roman-dadiomoff,Full of Suspense,9,27 September 2019,This is an excellent movie that exceeded expectations. My wife and I got to go to an advance screening and were expecting a solid 6 but it blew our socks off. Naomie Harris is phenomenal and her character Alicia's backstory is what made this such a good movie. To have grown up on those streets and know the people but to leave and serve in the Army to come back as a cop (presumably after her mother dies after you see her moms tombstone at the very beginning). This story is a great example about how one person can make a difference and that committing a crime is wrong no matter who does it.,Black and Blue

327,raymanll95,SMH to the negative reviews.,8,28 October 2019,Stop trying to make the white man look so innocent. If you imagine a cop most of the time you'll view a white man. If you imagine a thug you'll imagine a black man. Nobody in the movie said all cops were dirty and not 1 thug was viewed as innocent. Every bad guy in the movie goes down. The movie just shows a rookie cop exposing dirty cops. It's a good movie. Just a few predictable scenes.,Black and Blue

331,kelegedeon99,Don't focus on the rating! (my first review),9,17 November 2019,"I've never reviewed a movie here, but I had to justify this one! When I saw the trailer of Black and Blue, I knew for for sure I had to see it. It looked like an exciting adventure with non-stop action and suspense. The low rating however disappointed me. That is until I realized a lot of those who gave this film a bad rating was not because it was poor in writing or production quality, but because of their political bias or some agenda against what's portrayed in this film. IT'S JUST A MOVIE! This movie was not made to make police officers look bad, it's FICTIONAL storytelling. The film delivered everything I thought it would be and left me mostly satisfied and entertained throughout. They went straight to the point from the very beginning and wasted no time. This could be a good or bad thing. A deeper character development on Officer West and the others would have helped us understand their motives early on! *cough cough* I could go on and on but... I almost missed out on this fantastic film. Just go watch for yourself. If you like the trailer, you'll mostly enjoy the movie the same way.",Black and Blue
332,selenataifane,Too good!,9,28 October 2019,"I feel like the people who rated this movie a low score haven't seen it. They're just mad they think that it's a movie made to make cops look bad and somehow glorify thugs, when that's not at all what it does. I thought it was a good movie. I'm not gonna lie, things could've been a little bit more exciting, but it was a good movie overall! If they actually watched the movie, it says murder is murder....and people are people. And something along the lines of everyone's trying to say that we need to pick a side when there shouldn't be no sides to begin with. Good movie. Good message. If it's similar to another movie, so what?? It shouldn't be given a low score because of that. If you're reading this to see whether you should go watch it or not, I say GO WATCH IT ALREADY. Lol",Black and Blue

335,ciaranmcgreevy1986,Great Movie,10,24 October 2019,I enjoyed this movie. It is lightly based on the true memoir of a police officer. The rest of the reviews slamming if don't know the true story behind its creation. Solid 10.,Black and Blue
336,raksiniqramul,Dialogues,5,16 March 2020,The plot had the potential to make it a good movie. But very poor quality of dialogues and acting made this movie horribl! I don't recommend to watch it.,Black and Blue

339,iheartleelis,great movie! Bad reviews must be fake!,10,27 October 2019,"I read over some of the bad reviews and obviously they DID NOT WATCH the movie. This is not a BLM movie like some blindingly claim. If you actually watch the movie you'll see people of all color die and live! You see good people live and bad people die. If all you can see is color that's a personal problem that doesn't reflect the truth of the film. This movie was full off excitement and the story is great too. You see the internal struggles of a person from different perspectives and the film has a lot of great messages with out a lot of junk. This movie isn't overly exaggerated, gory, or full of foul language. Yet it's real and action packed. You see what some people deal with and how some cope through life's challenges both social and personal. There's messages of hope when you see bad people change and make good choices in the end. You can see other characters stand for what they believe in when it comes to their morals and values and see the contrast and consequences of other as well.",Black and Blue
340,onggiachay_max,To some bad reviewers!,8,25 October 2019,"Ok let's get this straight. The movie is pretty good to me. Some ""American traditional"" social problems are depicted strongly and its script is great also. I am not a drama person but I feel that it is a bit weird when most of bad reviews are made just because the content points out some cops are bad?! Really guys, isn't that not true? Guys, bad people are everywhere, they can be teachers, doctors and of course they can be cops. It's absolutely logical and makes sense. No matter if you are a real patriot or not, you can't deny this fact. It would be silly to rate the whole performance 1 star just because you don't accept this truth. Please don't be rude and make your reviews fairly so this website can bring its true value to everyone. To those who don't see the movie yet, there is nothing wrong with it, just spend some bucks buying tickets yourself, your sweetheart and families and enjoy the movie. I promise everything's gonna fine! Don't put your trust on haters!",Black and Blue
341,cferguson-17298,Not bad,4,21 May 2020,"Although it makes a few obvious mistakes and is a little bit predictable it's not a bad chase/shooter
the only thing is the buildings where the final battle takes place anyone from here (New Orleans) knows those buildings have been empty since Katrina I think they should've concealed it a bit better but if you didn't know it should not be a problem overall I'd watch it again",Black and Blue

But it WILL be universally seen through the murkiness of their success-thwarting attempts. Stolen diamonds don't hide forever...,Black and Blue

344,nicoledelancre,Character and the Truth Matter,9,25 October 2019,"I am sitting outside of the theatre and couldn't even wait to get home to see what the early reviews for Black and Blue are so far. I don't understand the low ratings, as I thought this movie was pretty solid. I think the point that race, status, geography, profession, etc. mean nothing when compared to right and wrong and the worth of a person's life came through in the struggle of Naomi Harris' character here. Her statement that she no longer saw any of those things-only the people-and the lengths she took to show she meant what she said was proof to that point. I for one thought this movie was great-and even if it doesn't change much right now, it's a start!",Black and Blue

346,orlandosnowproductions,The Leonard Part 6 of crime dramas. If you want to feel dumber then watch this movie.,2,21 May 2020,What a colossal piece of garbage. If this is starz attempt to be HBO then they might as well just give up now. I've been a member of IMDb for years and this is my first review. I just had to say some thing about this movie because it is so exceptionally bad. I don't believe I've ever seen anything so poorly executed before. It had great potential but it is just simply stupid. So if you want to dumb yourself down for a few hours then go ahead and watch this movie.,Black and Blue

350,al_swell,Better Than Expected,7,27 October 2019,Decent suspense with good acting . Storyline is more on the order of a Serpico 1973. Good cop breaks the blue line and roots out corruption in the PD. Not a great movie but not bad at all. I was pleasantly surprised.,Black and Blue

353,silivan,Stop acting like you are the right one (Bad reviewers),10,31 December 2019,"Most people giving this movie bad reviews are doing so in the name that the movie was one sided that is showing the cops as bad..Well news flash cops in departments do the exact same sutff as seen in the movie, the movie didnt pain all cops, we saw other cops that werent involved, you are all basically just denying thr truth of the matter. I never see sich bad reviews in famous titles where they travel to mexico and show drug lords and alot of poor people, you dont talk about how movies with drugs always involve latinos or African-Americans, you dont give bad reviews to your favourite titles when they travel to africa and show only the poor side (in the their movies). stop acting up..This movie is GREAAAAAAT",Black and Blue
354,lazorlamon,Negative review.,4,31 October 2019,"I just got back from this. The narrative was ok, I understand what they were going for, but as a fan of cinema and dialogue, this movie didn't do much for me. The dialogue was clunky and the lead actress was good in a few scenes in her perfomance, but overall she was very bland. I also can't give credit to a director willingly choosing to add in CGI blood in post. I rolled my eyes when anyone got shot.",Black and Blue

Nothing makes sense and it's usually cheesy one sentence lines that you keep hearing without any essence or purpose.",Black and Blue
356,tyronedmitchell,I think this is a good movie.,9,25 November 2019,"I think this is a good movie. It really shows how the residents and police interact in some communities. Some of the scenes in Black and Blue may seem over the top, but unless you have experienced some of the situations in the movie, or know someone who has, you definitely won't get it.
I think a lot of the bad reviews are biased because this movie tells the truth about police/community relations in a lot of impoverished, forgotten places. No one seems to want to hear /see the truth in this story because it hurts. I also think this movie wasn't advertised enough. I did not hear about before my wife said she wanted to go see it.
This movie kept me on the edge of my seat and hoping that the outcome would be good. I think most of the actors did a decent job with what they were given. I will watch Black and Blue again.",Black and Blue

359,thebowdler,"Good thriller, bit cheesy in places but great film on the whole",8,26 September 2021,It's a good film. Intense thriller. Can't see why you would give a bad review.
