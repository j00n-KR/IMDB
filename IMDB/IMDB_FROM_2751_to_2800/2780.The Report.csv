0,kosmasp,Whistle Torture,9,9 December 2020,"Not comparing this to anything going on right now (let's not if you can), because the climate right now is toxic as it is. Especially because this shows the depths of politically tip toeing around certain subjects ... and trying to keep the peace, even when you know what is wrong ... and what is right.So while there is a force trying to make things right ... you can understand all the side in this mix. At least I felt like that. And the great actors portraying the real people involved in this helped the issue (no pun intended). It may be long and there may be a lot of obstacles - but it is worth it, if you care enough. And why shouldn't you? What can be a ""bummer"" or a no go for some, is the depiction of violence or rather torture. But to really understand some of the stuff this is about it was necessary (imho).A really well made movie, with fine performances and dialog and a (real life) story that is quite mind blowing ...",The Report
1,CinemaSerf,"Promises much, but doesn't quite deliver...",6,11 November 2019,"Decent enough performances from Adam Driver and Annette Bening but I found this to be a bit of a poor man's ""All The President's Men"". It doesn't help that the entire premise of the film is, itself, incomplete and that certainly doesn't help with any sense of completion or conclusion. The wider issues regarding the role of the CIA and of their methods are largely under-discussed, though sometimes graphically demonstrated. This leaves us with a somewhat linear interrogation of both policy and practice by the US authorities and their agencies immediately post 9/11. It is a shame, it could have delivered so much more...",The Report
2,ferguson-6,stomach-churning politics,7,10 November 2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. Does the end justify the means? Do two wrongs make a right? These are questions of ethics and morality, and when it comes to the government, they can also be questions of legal and illegal, or even life and death. Scott Z Burns offers up his feature film directorial debut, and he has been best known as a screenwriter for Steven Soderbergh films such as THE LAUNDROMAT, SIDE EFFECTS, and THE INFORMANT! Mr. Burns certainly didn't choose an easy route for his first time in the director chair, as this is a heavy, thought-provoking, stomach-churner.Adam Driver plays Daniel Jones, a Senate staffer under Senator Dianne Feinstein. She charges him with leading the Senate investigation into the CIA's Enhanced Interrogation Technique (EIT) program after the 9/11 attack. It's easy to see why so many viewed this as a bad gig, but Jones became obsessed with uncovering the truth about what happened, who did what, and who knew what and when they knew it. This government procedural offers us an education on red tape, political boundaries, and the expertise in protecting fiefdoms in D.C. In other words, everything that we fear and despise about our own government officials is on display here.That said, it is refreshing to see someone so focused on getting to the truth as Jones is/was ... despite the systematic obstacles (destruction of tapes, party divisions). Annette Bening shines as Senator Feinstein and is quite effective in portraying just how difficult it can be for politicians to juggle all sides and pressures when a topic is so ""hot"". The film covers a period between 2003 and 2012, and most of the run time is spent on Jones' research for the report.
The supporting cast is deep and talented, and includes Jon Hamm as Obama Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, Michael C Hall, Maura Tierney, Victor Slezak, Tim Blake Nelson, Ben McKenzie, Matthew Rhys, Corey Stoll, and Ted Levine (as CIA Director John Brennan). One of the more interesting aspects of the film involves the contractors behind the EIT program. Basically, they are academics with no real world case studies or experience - just two guys looking to cash in on a lucrative government deal at a time when a country was desperate for answers.Watching the battle over the final release (or not) of ""The Torture Report"" (the word torture was redacted here) injects quite a bit of tension, and the inclusion of archival footage from the period is very effective. What's less effective is the overuse of shaky-cam in the first portion of the film, and the score is downright annoying at times as it attempts to ensure we are frustrated with the political wranglings. On the other hand, the dialogue is really crisp and there are some quietly-tense exchanges between folks that are well-written and well-acted. Adam Driver carries the bulk of the film and he is perfectly cast.The obvious comparisons are to ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN and SPOTLIGHT, though this one never quite reaches that level. Still, it's thought-provoking to watch as Jones considers a New York Times reporter to be the most ethical character he can turn to in his efforts to get the truth out. The film doesn't really choose sides ... everyone who participated in a cover-up or illegal activities takes a shot, as does Kathryn Bigelow's ZERO DARK THIRTY. This was a dark time in U.S. history, and it reminds us how difficult it seems to be to do the right thing while in government. Perhaps that's the biggest takeaway.",The Report
3,phd_travel,Concentrate it's worth the effort,8,17 December 2019,"The quality of the actors should tell you this is a worthy story to be told. So concentrate it's a complicated tale that spans years and crosses party lines.
Diane Feinstein puts a tenacious man in charge of looking into torture by the CIA. There is a lot to learn about torture. The movie shows both sides with this povs. The justifiers want to prevent another attack and save lives. The critics say in the majority of times it doesn't work, they only get info they already know and sometimes they get the wrong guy. Their aren't many movies telling how a government agency does bad things. This is one of the few. Adam Driver gives a convincing performance - outraged when he needs to be but not overacted. Annette Bening plays Feinstein. A host of familiar faces add credibility to supporting roles.
This movie keeps a complex issue clear and highlights the opposition to the report from both political parties.
A brave movie.",The Report
4,deloudelouvain,"A movie about cover-ups, about lying, about giving lessons while you should listen instead",8,2 January 2020,"I agree it doesn't matter which are your political preferences to review this movie. It doesn't matter because the torture happened, and if you're naive enough to think it will never happen again because of this movie or because a report has been written in the past you'll be very surprised in the future. It doesn't matter if it's a democratic or republican president, the CIA and other agencies will continue their foul sneaky business wether you like it or not, wether you agree or not. America has no lessons to give to anybody, on the contrary. This movie shows just what they will do to try to deny everything, to cover it up. In this case it was mission impossible and that's good. Adam Drive did an excellent job playing his character, as well as Annette Bening. The cast is well chosen, all quality acting. Don't expect action in this movie, you won't get it. Instead you get a lot of talking, sometimes difficult to understand if you like me are a bit fed up with politics, but it's certainly worth watching, just to try to understand in what kind of evil world we're living. A lot of talking and arguing but certainly a very good movie.",The Report
5,siderite,Americans tortured people for nothing then tried to cover it up from their own people,8,20 March 2020,"...and they did it with such gusto and in such a fluid manner that it is obvious these things happen all the time. The made the movie of the one reveal that actually got public, but it must be just the tip of the iceberg. After the unintentional hilarity of the first minute of the film, where Driver's voice over fits a little bit too closely to the plot of the latest Star Wars trilogy in which he is also starring, the movie just relentlessly throws fact after fact, proof after proof, tense moment after tense moment, torture after torture until all you can feel is outrage. And Burns and Soderbergh have this way of making you feel strong feelings in a rather cold way. They are not pointing fingers as much as remove curtains. They don't over dramatize things as much as they reveal simple, bland events. And yet, in the end, the picture they oh so slowly portray is evoking strong feelings while keeping the viewer informed. They did the same with Contagion in 2011, a movie very apropos at this time and also very good.So, this young guy is tasked with writing a report, alone with a small team, inside a basement, isolated from the world, sleep deprived, debased and humiliated... about how the CIA tortured prisoners by hiding them in basements, isolated, sleep deprived, debased and humiliated in order to teach them ""learned helplessness"". The parallel is not subtle at all. To be able to survive in the political world while compiling a report damning US politicians and security institutions is akin to resisting torture. A reporter tells the guy: ""They had you build a boat that they never intended to sail"" or something to that effect. There is a small moment when he almost went Snowden, but then reconsidered because he wanted to do the thing ""the right way""... and he almost failed.Bottom line: this is not an anti-American movie, it's a little partizan, though. It shows the evil corrupt side of the political system most than all. Prepare to see how incompetent people are paid millions to make others miserable, then are protected by any ill effects. If you just want the ending, no, there were no prosecutions for any of the things in the report: not the torture, not the cover up, not the lying to legislators.",The Report
6,DKosty123,Adam Driver Raises This Above The Bar,8,9 January 2020,"This film based upon the true coverup in Washington and the influence of Daniel Jones report on abuses of power and covering up the truth about a lot of important issues is more compeling viewing than the usual film of this type. That is mainly because of Adams Driver (Kylo Ren) great job as Jones. The energy he bring to this role are unmistakable, and if the film has gotten enough attention, he'd be up for an acting Oscar for this role. The film is well done.Annette Bening helps here in an excellent portrayal of Diane Feinstein. The interaction between Bening and Driver is sparkling conversation. The story being true about this report about US torturing prisoners and more is a strong basis for a fine dramtic film. It is must viewing and a great look at the problems powerbrokers were creating during the years of W Bush through into Obama. Jon Hamm plays Denis McDonough who would become Barack Obamas top ranking person in his second term. His role is more support but an interesting take on the man. The report covers the 911 investigation and beyond. Scott Z. Burns script covers the Bush era CIA investigation up into the Obama administration resistance to release the findings.Driver makes this role his own and it's great, yes this man can act without a light sabor. "" Jones and his team reviewed around 6.3 million pages of internal CIA documents and wrote a roughly 6,700-page report on their findings - often referred to as the ""torture report"" - which remains classified to this day."" It's an amazing story.The Report depicts how President Barack Obama's administration - specifically John O. Brennan's CIA - worked to undermine the Committee's efforts to make their findings public. "" It is based upon the executive 500 page summary which the CIA tried to suppress after the 2011 killing of Osama Bin Laden.This Amazon exclusive uses archive footage from many of the principals though none of the actual participants play themselves in this one. That's because the movie is based on the report, and this rock solid basis makes this film powerful. Adam Driver makes it more compeling. Catch this, you will not regret you did.",The Report
7,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Release the remaining pages.,7,2 December 2019,"'The Report (2019)' is an 'All The President's Men (1976)'-esque exposé on the controversial 'enhanced interrogation' used during the Bush administration in the wake of 9/11. The piece is angry, meticulous and surprisingly cinematic, brought to life with cinematography reminiscent of Jeff Cronenweth's work on 'The Social Network (2010)'. The picture keeps things interesting by vividly recreating certain segments of the eponymous report, hammering home the brutality of CIA-led torture and rallying against its subsequent cover-up. It's actually quite stylish. The thing moves at a solid speed, always remaining engaging, and it has a surprising amount of character, too. While Driver's protagonist isn't developed a massive amount, he certainly undergoes a distinct change and acts as a perfect voice for the outraged audience. It's actually an incredibly strong performance, backed up with equally-as-impressive supporting work from the likes of Bening and Hamm. The flick's structure leads to a two-half feel, which is probably necessary but certainly slows things down towards the middle. It's never boring, just slightly slower than it could've been. Even so, the picture is entertaining pretty much throughout. It's somewhat shocking but incredibly important. It's vital, vibrant and somewhat stirring, to boot. 7/10",The Report
8,ThomasDrufke,No Sense of Style,5,17 December 2019,"The Report is an undoubtedly solid film that completely lacks originality, urgency, and a sense of style. In fact, even at under 2 hours (a full 1.5 hours less than Netflix's The Irishman) it's tough to get through in one sitting. And the worst part about saying that is there's nothing blatantly wrong with the film upon first viewing, and yet it's easily one of the year's most boring films. Take 'Official Secrets' for example, not too dissimilar subject matter to The Report and it does so with a great sense of its audience and surroundings, always keeping its viewers engaged. It almost feels like The Report tries its best to nail every fact and detail about the real life story and forgets to be a movie, which by nature is a piece of entertainment. I'm normally the first guy in line to recommend this sub genre of drama's, but The Report won't be one of them.5.7/10",The Report
9,Cineanalyst,"Mr. Jones Goes to Washington, Finds Torture Porn, Leaves Washington",4,16 March 2020,"Movies like this bug me. I suppose there's something useful in it, like the report on the CIA's ineffective torture practices it's based on, because most people are never going to read those thousands of pages, and surely some never followed the news closely enough to even learn much second-hand reporting on the matter. Ditto the significance of recreating the scenes of torture for the audience to face. So, ""The Report"" becomes a digested record of history in a form palatable to a wider audience, of a feature-length movie starring Adam Diver, Annette Benning and other well-known actors. Something to combat the distortions in ""Zero Dark Thirty"" (2012), the Best Picture Oscar nominee referenced within ""The Report."" But, it's not a good movie, not if you're looking for art or craft instead of history and morality lessons--or, worse yet, political ones.It's hackneyed. Again, they go on with the relentless speechifying--the back-and-forth on Capitol Hill as though it were an episode of ""The West Wing."" Nowhere else besides in the world of bad screenwriting is a senate aide correcting their lawyer's misattribution of a quotation to Churchill. Composite characters running against stated facts, including a would-be CIA director. That musical scoring for the speeches by Senator Dianne Feinstein (as played by Benning) and Senator John McCain is atrocious. I get that the filmmakers may think they need heroes and some American patriotism at the end of a story about staffers working in a windowless basement for years composing volumes on documents from the CIA demonstrating the agency's use of ""enhanced interrogation techniques,"" its ineffectiveness, wastefulness and the propagandizing otherwise--and, then, only for the CIA to spy on them, threaten jail time and attempt to bury the report. But, that's not good reporting. It's not non-partisan. It's not entirely what it aspires to be about. Sure, ""Zero Dark Thirty"" may be more inaccurate, but's it's also a better movie.",The Report

12,Dr_Coulardeau,Prevention of war and torture are not even considered,10,17 May 2020,"This is an essential film in the present situation and time. After 9/11 and with the war in Afghanistan and the War in Iraq, the United States launched themselves and their military personnel into a CIA controlled adventure that could be compared with Mengele's experiments in Auschwitz. medically and psychologically trained and even graduated people devised from their textbooks directly into Guantanamo the procedure that should give good results. That was plain torture, physical, moral, and psychological. In Abu Ghraib, they even went further in the way to frighten and humiliate prisoners into telling whatever could be deemed interesting. The very first thing that has to be said is that the people who are behind this nightmare, the ""thinkers"" who think with their twisted perverse sadistic desires and impulses, or the torturers themselves, be they men or women only dealing with male prisoners, who find pleasure, bliss, enjoyment and even ecstasy in this mental perverse onanism, all of them, are deprived of any sense of humility and humanity. It is their vain proud belief that they can do whatever they want on whoever they can put their hands on to avenge 9/11 and to prevent whatever the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were bound to produce. They knew it was useless and ineffective and that even if it were effective it would not be moral or ethical, and it would be a stain on their own psyche and minds. They did it all the same and they were covered by all sorts of politicians and bureaucrats, from the president of The US down to the top-ranking CIA officials and down to some obscure executioners covered by the afore-mentioned absentee masters of ceremony, and these at the lowest level were nothing but executioners since that torture was to bring people so close to death that they would be so frightened and so disoriented that they would talk. And a few actually died with no real statistics to tell us how many.Senator Dianne Feinstein had to fight for a lot more than five years to get a report written and to have it published on those events. That's what the film is showing. It is dramatic and sickening to see - and the film is discreet in showing Bush, Obama, and consorts - their nearly impossible mission for one covering and for the other banning such practices that were so deeply ingrained in the American supremacist vanity of so many in the US.And this is only the past because things now are done a lot more discreetly or via some other agents who are in no way connected to the US. Look at Yemen, look at Syria, look at the Islamic State, look at the Talibans, look at the Iraqi military and police forces, look at the Afghan military and police forces, etc. And look at the drones, and those are American, and how they torture a whole people in Syria, Yemen, and other places, with the fear that they are coming and they might kill one terrorist but they will kill ten innocent civilians. The result is that the terrorists are hidden even better so that the drones won't come. Survival is a strange bird that is not afraid of any oil-spill in any ocean. To survive many people are ready to do anything that might prevent the cataclysmic drones.In the present situation, the systematic provocations against China and the probably numerous CIA agents infiltrated in China itself as they were and still are in Hong Kong, all are trying to bring the pandemic after the trade war to a point when and where the US president will be able to retort with force to teach these ""goons"" a good old military lesson. If you listen to this ""bully in chief"" the US soon enough will no longer have any Walmart or whatever big retail stores you can imagine, but they will be able to produce a many-million strong army of drones. Boeing planes are grounded, Boeing planes are under scrutiny for sloppy technology, but Boeing drones will multiply and decimate everything and everyone in the world that will dare speak against Boeing. The battle here is to destroy all non-American brands and to only tolerate those foreign brands that will kneel in front of and play obedience to the US president who soon will be forever if you listen to the mermaids singing in the Styx, down in Hades, conducted by the ferry navigator Charon. The French hopping frog Sanofi has a chance if they produce a vaccine for COVID-19 by December 2020 and provide it to Americans first to Keep America Great Again.Do not believe torturing and war are in the past. The US is engaged in such an adventurous tempting caper that it can get nasty any day. Who cares in the White House that the count of deaths by the end of the month of May will be widely over 100,000 and that unemployment will probably reach 40 million, as long as the US will be ready to use fire and furor, to destroy as they have never done before, except in Tokyo and Hiroshima and Nagasaki, their targets which are North Korea; China and Venezuela. And they keep Iran in store for some entertaining pause. The worst warmongers ever seen in the USA are now in power and preparing to remain there for some more time because nothing serious is standing in front of them, and even so, the contender is just on the same line as for China, North Korea, and Russia. All-out force, power, brutality. They have declared war on one-fourth of humanity.That's what this film brings up in your mind when you listen to every single word it contains. And there are many words to be listened to.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU",The Report
13,zkonedog,An Important Mistake To Be Remembered,9,12 December 2019,"There's an old saying that goes ""those who do not learn from history are condemned to repeat it"". Films like ""The Report"" are made to make sure that message is taken to heart. Fortunately, this is about as good as it gets in that department.For a very basic overview, this film focuses on Daniel Jones (Adam Driver), a Senate staffer working for Dianne Feinstein (Annette Benning). Jones is tasked with piecing together an accounting of the United States' Detention & Enhanced Interrogation program implemented by the CIA immediately following the events of 9/11. What Jones finds is a trail of lies, cover-ups, justifications, and an ineffectiveness that borders on criminal.What makes ""The Report"" so sad (and thus so emotionally compelling) is the slow realization it builds to, which is that not one piece of actionable material was gained from the use of torture and detention. The entire program was a charade that conflicted previous CIA findings in the realm of interrogation, relied on pseudo-science of the most dubious order, and was sanctioned by the highest levels of the White House for years. This from a Bush Administration which had the temerity to directly say ""we do not torture"".When sitting down to watch this movie, please make sure to give it some time to unspool. At first, it looks like it might be a B-level flick, filled with enough names, dates, and places to make your head spin a bit. But as it narrows its focus, it turns into an absolute treatise on its sensitive subject matter. The same can be said for Driver's performance. It starts out a bit underwhelming, but by the end is quite powerful and moving.A final major positive to take from ""The Report""? It truly is not much of a partisan film. While it refers to the Bush Administration by necessity, this isn't a picture for the express consent to bash any specific person or party. It has an agenda (to show the horrors of inflicting severe bodily harm/discomfort on others in the name of national security and ultimately have absolutely nothing to show for it), but it isn't preachy about it.Upon finishing ""The Report"", you'll likely be pretty steamed, and that's about the greatest compliment I can give it. Easily the kind of thing you could show a class of students (or event adults who lived through the events) to give a sort of counter-perspective removed from the rah-rah patriotism which was occurring at the time.",The Report
14,eddie_baggins,A strong investigational thriller with another great Adam Driver turn,7,26 May 2020,"Want further proof that Adam Driver is one of the best actors operating today?Want more insight into America's shady operations that often go by unannounced in the public eye?Well you're in luck if you want either or both of those things (at once!) as The Report provides them in abundance.Directed by screenwriter Scott Z. Burns, who has found his work in the spotlight of recent times thanks to his eerily prophetic work on 2011 pandemic feature Contagion, The Report takes an uncompromising look at the work of senate staffer Daniel J. Jones, who over the course of a number of years investigated the techniques and effectiveness of the USA's post 9/11 detention and interrogation programs, that by the law should never have been allowed to take place in the way in which they did.This is the type of dramatic thriller that is devoid of gun fights or car chases as Burns instead follows Driver as Jones across the large time-span his work takes place in, as the idealistic American citizen finds himself shocked and appalled at the data he has been given access to as he and his small team look to shine a light on the operations that had seemingly been swept under the rug, held back from public scrutiny.As the unassuming Jones, Driver delivers another awards worthy turn, it's not a showy piece of acting or as memorable as another piece of his 2019 work Marriage Story, but as Jones digs further and further into the files upon files of information he has been granted access to, all the while being met with constant opposition from various politicians and government operatives, Driver remains a powerful presence throughout, even if Burns doesn't strike pure thematic gold in his attempt to bring this tale to life.Surrounded by recognisable figures like Annette Benning, Jon Hamm, Corey Stoll and Michael C. Hall, Burns doesn't appear to be able to create the support and insight outside of Jones quest to bring The Report to a full circle offering, at times it feels as though we are being short-changed as an audience in regards to screen time or insights into various motivations or character beats, no doubt a result of the film trying to cover off a number of years' worth of material and information in its attempt to give this investigatory matter time of day.There's no big moments to be found here either, the film is almost entirely operating in a state of methodical movements that take place without any sense of urgency or rush, this is a style and delivery that maintains The Report as a solid and insightful offering, but one that lacks the power and conviction to make it top echelon.Final Say -A fine showcase for the amazing work of Adam Driver and another cinematic showpiece for the shady dealings of the American dream, The Report is solid stuff but not up there with the best of this type of true-life reporting behemoths.3 ½ redacted names out of 5",The Report
15,paul-allaer,When the CIA goes rogue (again): it will anger and enrage you,8,23 November 2019,"""The Report"" (2019 release; 120 min.) brings the story of what happened to the Senate Intelligence Committee report on what went wrong with the CIA's detention and ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" (the so-called EITs). As the movie opens, we see congressional staffer Daniel Jones seemingly meeting with his lawyer about the possible removal of documents. We then go back to ""2007"", when Jones is appointed by Senate Dianne Feinstein to look into what is going on in Iraq. Jones and his small staff are immediately stonewalled from every which direction.... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie but to tell you more of the plot will spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from director Scott Burns, best known for writing thriller like The Borne Ultimatum. Here he brings a story to the big screen which is likely to enrage as it is to anger you. Bottom line is that the CIA, without telling anyone, started to use ""enhanced techniques"" (read: TORTURE) on Iraqi prisoners and terrorists, and then the CIA covered it up and lied about it (including to President Bush). A congressional staffer is determined to shed the light on it all. Adam Drive is EXCELLENT as the so(m)ber congressional staffer, and Annette Bening is virtually unrecognizable as Senator Feinstein.""The Report"" opened last weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati for what turned out to be a one week run only (the movie goes wide on Netflix in the next week or so). The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended dismally (3 people, including myself), and frankly, I can't blame anyone as this movie is a depressing movie. That said, it is also an engrossing and important movie, reminding us why there are legislative check-and-balances on institutions like the CIA, and yet more so with the current state of affairs in DC with an unhinged and megalomaniac POTUS who literally believes he can do ANYTHING he wants regardless of any law. Of course I encourage you to check out ""The Report"", be it at the theater (unlikely at this point, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",The Report

It also throws into the mix whether torture to save Americans is justified, and many supported that stance. The point here is they broke the law and lied about it and interestingly ultimately accepted that it didn't work.As a result this is a detailed often quasi documentary approach to how complex and self defeating democracy and America's approach to it is and why sometimes it doesn't always work. It is therefore not always that exciting and at times it is somewhat frustrating, but it does in due course tell a fascinating story through careful editing and fine performances by Driver and Bening.The ultimate point is that the US broke its own rules using all legal and political tricks at its disposal, but to its credit this story still got out.",The Report

We are watching intelligent adults who are willing to engage in torture not for information but because they can twist words to justify anything. This well-acted film is really about the first-amendment. Fortunately, we can look at government actions and criticize them without fear of reprisals from the government. No doubt this film can raise the hackles of some who see it as nothing more than a partisan polemic but it is a warning about what an unrestricted government agency can do. It is short step from being a CIA interrogator to becoming a Nazi claiming I was but following orders.

22,jadepietro,A Gripping and Intelligent Political Drama,9,22 December 2019,"GRADE: B+THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A thought-provoking study of two religious leaders featuring two wonderful performances.JIM'S REVIEW: The Report is a fact-based film that slowly unravels the findings of a political investigation and cover-up of CIA torture policies toward prisoners after 9/11. Using actual testimony and the Senate Intelligence Committee's report on interrogation programs endorsed by President George Bush as its basis, director / writer Scott Z. Burns creates a brutal and honest film about one of the darkest chapters in America's history. The filmmaker tries to present an even-keeled look at governmental corruption at its worst and succeeds, most of the time, from pontificating its controversial target: the systematic torturing and inhumane treatment of political prisoners.We follow Daniel Jones, a dedicated Senate aide for Diane Feinstein, who is assigned to investigate any wrongdoing by the United States against prisoners. The film jumps back and forth throughout a decade of research, from 2001 to 2013, as Jones meets endless roadblocks and political limits to uncover the truth. The film takes a while to coordinate the complicities of the events but, as the film progresses, the story becomes more compelling and even more shocking.Scenes of the psychological and physical torture to exact information from captive terrorists are graphically seen but never gratuitously handled. They are disturbing in nature, yet necessary to convey the hypocrisy and cruelty inflicted on political prisoners along with the lies and secrets kept from the American public.The film downplays any physical action or chase sequences and relies on its narrative and whistleblower plot to impress. In doing so, the film transcends the aspects of a routine political thriller with its emphasis on the eloquence of words and ability to state the obvious so succinctly. Mr. Burns' screenplay addresses the interplay of dialog and artful arguments for and against these hellish policies so passionately in lengthy speeches which compound the film's impact. The effect of these wordy debates is one of outrage and frustration.The ensemble is remarkable. Both Mr. Driver and Ms. Bening are totally believable in their exacting roles. They inhabit their real life counterparts and deliver their lines with much verve. The strong supporting cast includes Jon Hamm, Maura Tierney, Tim Blake Nelson, Michael C. Hall, and Matthew Rhys. Douglas Hodge and T. Ryder Smith play two nefarious psychologists with sadistic tendencies very well and a particularly frightening Ted Levine as a remorseless John Brennan has some memorable moments.Sadly, this film is being lost among many films this holiday season. It is a story that needs to be heard and retold. The Report may be a disturbing subject for most moviegoers, one that we may want to avoid. But it is a necessity that we cannot afford to overlook, lest we repeat our failures and lose our humanity for the sake of country.",The Report

25,blott2319-1,A lackluster and repetitive film about something that is vitally important,6,30 October 2020,"I'm a big fan of a legal drama, and when you raise the stakes and make it all about a governmental cover-up, then you've really piqued my interest. I expected to like The Report a lot, and it did deliver some of the thrills that I enjoy from this type of drama. It's also extra impactful because it is all based on the real history of our nation. The other thing I appreciated about The Report is that it felt fairly apolitical. Sure, there are politicians who were involved in the planning and coverup of these detention centers, but there were definite mistakes made on both sides of the aisle when it comes to the handling of this information and the movie didn't shy away from that point. I also thought Adam Driver did a good job of playing a character who slowly escalates from dispassionate to fanatical as he spends more time working on this project. Perhaps my only complaint in the actors is that many of the CIA agents were played a bit over-the-top as conniving bad guys.The unfortunate thing is that I don't think they did the best job of making The Report cinematic, and it lacked something in the story-telling department. Constantly recounting the atrocities done by members of the CIA, while showing many of them re-enacted, works to make a point and to shock the audience. However, at a certain point we get what they are trying to say, and yet they keep saying it for another hour. It begins to feel like the film-makers are reveling in the display of torture as much as those who performed the tortures. I can't count the number of times they repeat things in this film, and it wasn't advancing the story in any way. Meanwhile, there are more compelling parts of the movie that stall out with no explanation of any kind (like the main character's meeting with a lawyer.) I certainly think The Report contains important information and it is a story that needed to be told, I only wish it was told by someone who was more skilled than a guy who wrote a few mediocre Soderbergh movies.",The Report

Daniel Jones (Adam Driver) is a staffer tasked by Democrat Dianne Feinstein (Annette Bening) to lead the investigation and feels the full of weight of government against him. Daniel becomes driven and obsessed with the investigations that takes him years to produce this 6,300 page document and even faced suppression during the Obama administration.There are so many episodes in post 9/11 governance that make and have made for powerful cinema and storytelling and this is one. It is well directed and written by Scott Z. Burns in a factual way, driven by Driver's committed performance.

30,kjproulx,A Fantastic Story that Only Translated to a Good Movie,7,3 December 2019,"I always seem to be fascinated by true stories that make it into a feature film, that were otherwise hidden until then, but I also wonder how true it really is, given the fact that these stories were kept a secret. That aside, regardless of the source material, I always go into movies like The Report with an open mind and try not to nitpick facts that probably aren't completely true. Put together in the same vein as movies like The Social Network or Molly's Game, the pacing of this movie is off the charts. While it's absolutely an imperfect movie in retrospect, this is a solid watch and here's why.After the horrific day known as 9/11 had passed, Daniel Jones (Adam Driver) was recruited to helm an investigation into the CIA's secretive ways of interrogating individuals. Some of the findings were disgusting and thus sparked the need to get this story in the public eye. While I don't believe all stories like this need attention, I believe this one warranted a film adaptation. The material at hand and the nicely paced editing by Greg O'Bryant were the standout elements here because the wasn't always interesting enough to hold my attention.The Report is a film that spews tons and tons of information on its audience. There are scenes where I found myself completely invested and others where I was slightly bored. Not to say the movie as a whole is boring, but I didn't think there were enough surprises to really make this movie hit home. From the editing to the quippy dialogue, it just felt like a movie that had the potential to be a great film like The Social Network, but it just didn't go the extra mile. Still, this is a solid film with some great performances.Adam Driver seems to get better and better as the years go on and The Report is no exception to that. This performance shows his immense maturity as an actor and I truly do see a future where he wins an Academy Award one day. It also didn't hurt that he has a lot of great dialogue to work from, written by Scott Z. Burns. From The Bourne Ultimatum to Contagion, I have really liked his work thus far (excluding The Laundromat). This movie was a nice mixture of a lot of good, that just didn't quite become great in many areas.In the end, The Report could've been a movie that received a lot of awards consideration, but I think the novels written about these behind-the-scenes events will probably be more informative. This movie feels more like a briefing, rather than an in-depth exploration. The movie has been made and I wouldn't touch it, but I think it could've worked much better as a television series. I can't exactly rave about the movie as a whole, but it's worth watching for the story alone.",The Report

Jones, tasked by his boss to lead an investigation into the CIA's post 9/11 Detention and Interrogation Program, uncovers shocking secrets. I saved you a few seconds; you're welcome.How did the EIT (Enhanced Interrogation Techniques) program of the CIA come about, who knew about it, who lied about it and why, is what this docudrama is about, and of course the unabated efforts by one individual, Daniel Jones, played brilliantly by Adam Driver, to get to the bottom of it all.I got the distinct impression, more than that actually, that investigative work is long and hard, not to mention shocking at times. This is different than other stories about whistleblowing, because it isn't that. It's different as well than news reporting because it is not part of the story, not where Daniel Jones' work is concerned. So what it is about? It is how some incompetent opportunists convinced the CIA to use them to get information from captured suspects or actual terrorists by means of EIT, how they sold that idea to the CIA, how no information came about by the illegal practices used, why the CIA ignored the past failures of such methods, why they lied about that, how they got away with it and how Congress and the world learned about the truth, and how likely we are to yet again repeat the same mistakes.

Adam Driver put so much energy into his role. It really shows. And even though not much back ground information or special character traits were developed for his role, he portrayed it on such a human and realistic way. Hands down one of the best best lead performances of the year so far. Annette Being was similar powerful. What made her performance was so special was the subtleness of it... not one of Bening's specialities as she is a very theatrical actress, but here she showed her calmer side and shows the same intensity as usual. I also enjoyed Jon Hamm and many of the other supporting players, there was not one weak performance.

The timeline and presentation of how the enhanced interrogation tactics became accepted after 9/11 was really well done, and even as the political and moral challenges lost some steam in the third act, Adam Driver's strong performance carried it home. The script is tight and does a great job of showing how the torturers justified their actions while also clearly showing the atrocities they committed. Driver was excellent in showing Jones' absolute dedication to the report and his unwavering anger with the immoral actions taken. The build was strong, and I loved the depiction of the power struggle between the CIA covering up and Congress trying to release the report. The debate between harming people now when the tortures are no longer happening, versus letting this go and setting a precedent of condoning such actions so it could happen again was the strongest message in the movie. The struggle seemed to fall away pretty suddenly once a couple Congress members asked for it, and the simple resolution to a very complex political process was anticlimactic and vaguely unsatisfying. It's quite well made, if by-the-numbers, and is important because it's a true and relevant story right now.

39,PyroSikTh,Soulless but Ultimately Informative,7,15 December 2019,"The Report centers on the Torture Report which was made public in a redacted format five or six years ago. It is nearly 7,000 pages of classified investigations into the CIA's EIT (enhanced interrogation techniques) program, which resulted in the torture and inhumane treatment (and in some cases death) of nearly 200 detainees suspected of involvement in 9/11, and zero unique or actionable information over the course of seven years. The film is broadly split into two halves, the first focussing on the investigation and writing of the report, and the troubles the team had in getting to the truth. The second half focuses on the difficulties of actually getting the report released.To say that's the story is maybe a bit of a misnomer, as The Report plays out more like a docudrama than a fully-fledged movie in its own right. Almost every scene and line of dialogue is in service of delivering facts and information to the audience. We don't get to see anything beyond the report, which results in each character feeling hollow and soulless. Daniel Jones, as a character, exists only to write and release the report. Any time we're given a chance to get into his head and explore him as a person, he's shut down for one reason or another.The film moves at such a blistering pace that no time is left to look beyond the facts and information. A prime example of this comes later in the movie, but spans the majority of the runtime. The film opens somewhere in the middle, with Jones talking to a lawyer about stealing official documents, and then rewinds to the beginning, promising to get back to it later. When the film does get back to it, it's left as a cliffnote. Jones met a lawyer. It went nowhere. He pursued other tactics to avoid criminal offences. The most dramatic the movie gets is swept under the rug within a few minutes because it wasn't all that dramatic or tense in real life, and didn't directly relate to the report itself. This would've been a fantastic moment to have a look at the character of Jones and what he's feeling about being accused by the CIA. But alas.On a more factual basis, as a docudrama, The Report is more successful. While none of it is particularly new information (I feel like I was aware of the CIA's torture program well before the release of the report), it is nice to see it all presented in one place, giving us flashbacks, and explaining the nuances in more detail. On this basis the second half of the film feels more interesting, as a lot of it revolves around behind-the-scenes dealings between the various parties and organisations involved. It was interesting learning about the extent to which the CIA lied about the EIT program, and continued to lie and cover it up well after it was shut down by President Obama.On which note the film doesn't feel especially political either, which is particularly impressive considering it almost entirely takes place in DC and Virginia. Both sides of the political discussion of America are painted with equally unflattering lights. The Bush administration doesn't come out too good for allowing it in the first place, while the Obama administration doesn't come out too good for trying to stifle the report's release. Democratic senator Feinstein labels Edward Snowden a traitor, while Obama's Chief of Staff pushes for incredible amounts of redacting for the 500-page summary. On the other hand the Republican members of the investigative team pull out entirely early on. Another thing that helped the film in a more docudrama stance was how it didn't cast actors for the more famous politicians. Dick Cheney, Barack Obama, John McCain, and Robert Mueller all make small cameos in archive footage, ultimately giving the film an undeniable sense of authenticity.Ultimately I feel like The Report would've been better as a full-on documentary with dramatic reconstructions, than being a two hour reconstruction with Adam Driver and Annette Benning behind the dramatic wheels. Neither of them get a whole lot to work with, nor do Maura Tierney, Jon Hamm, Michael C. Hall, Ted Levine, Douglas Hodge, or Corey Stoll. The Report is full of facts and information, but too light on drama and/or tension to be a semi-fictional movie. It lacks the panazz or The Big Short or Vice, the artistic stylings of The Social Network, or the gut-punches of Spotlight. I give it a soulless but ultimately informative 7/10.",The Report

With the truth at stake, Jones battled tirelessly to make public what many in power sought to keep hidden. Scott Z. Burns has wrote a few screenplays in the past (Contagion, The Laundromat, The Bourne Ultimatum) that I liked and with a heavy topic like this, I couldn't be more interested to see what he could do with this. Also with Adam Driver and Annette Bening, this was a must see for me. It came on Amazon Prime this past week and had a limited release. I'm glad he made this film. This film provided so much insight on what all went down and some is pretty horrific. Politically this will anger some people who don't believe in everything that was said. That's something I love when writers and directors do. When they take the chance to make something that will be controversial, that shows how daring they are and how much they want this specific story to be told. It's sort of like Vice in that sense, but definitely not a comedy. Like I said earlier, they show some of the scenes of torture and they were actually hard to watch at times. Great editing by the way. The performances were superb. I used to have mixed feelings on Adam Driver's acting when he first started out, but he's come such a long way and is getting all of the praise. The attention will go more towards his role in Marriage Story this year, but still he did such a fantastic job. The star, for me, was Annette Bening. I love her as an actress and I'm still mad that she hasn't won an Oscar yet. If she doesn't get into the Supporting Actress category I will be very upset. She shows an array of emotions and I kept forgetting that she wasn't Dianne Feinstein and actually Annette Bening. I always look forward to a film with her name in it. I like movies that make me mad at people and this one really worked in that case. The script is really strong and I hope people start talking about this more. I will say it has a bit of a pacing problem. There were times where is was going at a good pace, and then slow down. I think that's due to the many time jumps in the story. It may have benefitted them if they lengthened the film a little more and spent more time on a specific time. This is a film that had so much buzz to begin with and then it just really died down. I would suggest seeing The Report. It will shock many and probably get many mad.My Grade: B+",The Report
41,CineMuseFilms,An ugly episode in recent CIA history,8,28 December 2019,"It is hard to watch a film like The Report (2019) and not feel the heavy weight of its bigger picture. After all, the depicted events are recent enough to affect current attitudes to USA government, especially under a presidency that regularly subverts the separation of powers.Based on extensive factual evidence, 'the report' in the film's title was originally known as The CIA Torture Report. It was compiled over five years by investigative staffer Daniel Jones (Adam Driver) who worked for Californian Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein (Annette Bening). Its purpose was to examine the role of the Central Intelligence Agency in using 'enhanced interrogation techniques' for extracting intelligence from terrorists captured after the 9/11 attack. Euphemisms aside, the report was about the CIA's use of brutal and inhumane torture, illegal under American and international treaty since 1984.There are two extraordinary revelations in the film. The first is that two mediocre psychologists, with no practical interrogation experience, convinced a gullible CIA that their techniques would open treasure troves of terrorist information. They had no research to back their claims and were little more than snake-oil merchants preying on the infinite budgets that were pumped into post 9/11 hysteria. After years of interrogations in notorious Guantanamo Bay, the report revealed that no useful information was extracted, several prisoners died in the process, and about a quarter of the 'terrorists' were subsequently found to be innocent.
The second revelation is the scale of institutional corruption emanating from the highest level of the CIA as it thwarted the Senate Committee charged with its oversight. The hacking into Senate Committee files, the subsequent cover-up, and the refusal to admit to crimes and atrocities were swept under the carpet. So morally complacent had the White House become, even President Obama refused to condemn what the CIA was doing.Despite the desk-bound inaction and dialogue-heavy script, this is a riveting and important film. Its tension curve is driven by the enormity of CIA criminality and Adam Driver's ability to portray a humble David who took on an arrogant Goliath; Daniel Jones' bravery and commitment to truth was remarkable. Annette Bening is adequate as Senator Feinstein, although constrained by the realpolitik of her role. With President Trump on record saying he has no objection to torture, this film sounds a loud warning. Lest we forget that official barbarism infects an entire country.",The Report

""The Report"" is not a spectacle, it's not overly dramatic, but moves at an even pace, offers constant flow of plot development instead of boredom - these are also the reasons why some may describe the movie as dry, promising a delivery that never comes - I get that, but I also disagree. Another satisfying aspect is the more than stellar cast, even most of the really small roles are filled by talented and known faces. Adam Driver has never failed me before, also not this time & I don't know wether the hate for him is a meme or just another dismissible and disrespectable creation by our ever degrading virtual society. I was slightly disappointed about Jon Hamm, whose face on the poster turned out to be more of a marketing device, as his total screen time amounted to around 10 minutes, maybe. I love me some Jon Hamm. All jokes aside, ""The Report"" might not be an exceptional, but definitely is a great effort on every level of filmmaking - acting, writing and directing included. If we talks visuals, the cinematography and aesthetical mood does nothing but adds to the overall tone and cinematic flow.""The Report"" is easy to disappear in, it's an engaging re-telling of a morally messed up events & through a convincing performance by Adam Driver we are able to identify with the subject in question.

Awful torture methods were used 119 times but succeeded only ONCE to get a confession that turned out to be true.

I had a hard time with the Left-wing bias because it's now 2021 & the Arizona audit proves the Democrats corrupted the election. Trump should be doing his 2nd term. The Durham reports Hillary's lawyer lied to the FBI about Russia so Trump was mercessly attacked by fake news & illegally prosecuted by the Democrats throughout his term.,The Report
47,sriramthestranger,Movie based on Facts!,8,12 August 2020,"This could have been an interesting documentary. Anyway, the movie adaptation is still better and deals only with the facts and not as an emotional drama. The movie is not one-sided and puts forth the arguments from both the sides. While one party says - ""It is to protect the country and its citizens"", the other party questions - ""Does such brutal interrogation measures are really effective?"". A very interesting take on a real event at the top levels of Government functions.",The Report
48,WalkdenEntertainment,The One Critical Report You Should See...,7,14 January 2020,"A member of Senator Dianne's (Annette BenNINg) staff, Daniel (Adam Driver), is assigned to lead a team of his own choosing to investigate the past methods of Interrogations used by the CIA after the tragic events of 9/11. Soon Daniel finds himself heavily invested in the case and ends up devoting many hours, in fact years, of his life to the investigation as he becomes determined to reveal the truth and bring justice to the world.Personally I wasn't aware of this case so naturally I was rather curious to know about this story. The film has a really nice positive way of setting up the film and introducing us to its characters. From the beginning it is very clear that our leading man Daniel is a workaholic and has no time for relationships, instead giving each task everything he's got. Once he begins the new case it doesn't take long for the audience to become invested with both the film and story.Actor Adam Driver delivers a terrific performance as the character of Daniel and is able to show both the character's passion for the truth and his abilities while investigating this case. Actress Annette BENNING is also generally positive in her support role.But what I really enjoyed about The Report is simply the story itself. This film has no action and to call it a thriller also feels slighty incorrect. More than anything it feels like a political drama.Naturally this film is very dialogue heavy, not just about 9/11 but also about Politics, Ethics and Government. Despite being dialogue heavy, the film is quite basic and satisfying. It isn't trying to achieve anything awesome in the surround sound or visual department. The overall appearance is generally plain and gritty, but I personally wouldn't have it any other way given the type of story this is.Overall, I quite enjoyed The Report as a political drama. Learning more about this interesting story through Adam Driver's solid performance is a positive experience for this Amazon Prime film.7.9/10

52,Bertaut,"Probably too rooted in the theatrical tradition for some, but it does an exceptional job of compacting a massive amount of info into a comprehensible form",8,7 December 2019,"Anyone who has read even a little history knows that as a method of extracting useful intel, torture doesn't work. It didn't work for the Spanish Inquisition, it didn't work in Salem, it didn't work in Vietnam, it didn't work here in Ireland during the 800 years of English occupation. It has never worked and it never will, a fact known since at least the 17th century (although the Ancient Romans also had their suspicions).Written and directed by Scott Z. Burns, The Report tells the story of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's $40m, five-year investigation into the CIA's illegal use of torture in the years after 9/11, and the subsequent attempts to cover it up. From 2002-2008, the Detention and Interrogation Program (to give it its official title), saw the CIA employing ""Enhanced Interrogation Techniques"" (EIT), at a cost of $80m to the American taxpayer, with detainees held in secret locations around the world (known as ""black sites""). Completed in 2012, the Committee's findings were detailed in a 6,700-page Report, which remains classified, although a redacted 525-page Executive Summary was published in 2014. What the film does exceptionally well is to condense this vast quantity of information down into a relatively easy-to-digest narrative. More of a procedural drama than a political thriller, it could do with a little emotion, and there's no denying that it's very, very talky, perhaps to the extent of being more suited to stage than screen. However, irrespective of this, it's a brilliantly acted, unflinching, and insightful look at one of the most shameful moments in US history.The film's plot is extremely straightforward - in light of the Agency's 2005 destruction of 92 videotapes containing interrogation material, Senator Dianne Feinstein (Annette Bening) appoints Senate investigator Daniel J. Jones (Adam Driver) as the head of a bipartisan six-person team (three Democrats, three Republicans) to investigate the Agency's general conduct when interrogating suspected terrorists. The film then takes us (often achronologically) from the commencement of the investigation in early 2009 on up to the fight to have the Report made public in 2013/2014, with both the CIA and the Obama Administration throwing up multiple obstacles. Along the way we're introduced to a plethora of characters, embodied by an exceptional cast with not a weak link amongst them - there's John Brennan (the always superb Ted Levine), Director of the CIA; Bernadette (the goddess that is Maura Tierney, playing against type) a thinly-veiled fictionalisation of Gina Haspel, Base Chief at Detention Site Green in Thailand and current CIA Director; Denis McDonough (Jon Hamm), White House Chief of Staff; Caroline D. Krauss (Jennifer Morrison), General Counsel of the CIA; Thomas Eastman (Michael C. Hall), CIA counsel; Raymond Nathan (Tim Blake Nelson), a fictional composite representing the members of the CIA's Office of Medical Services stationed at Detention Site Green, who raised early concerns about EIT; James Mitchell (Douglas Hodge) and Bruce Jessen (T. Ryder Smith), the psychologists who developed and implemented the EIT program; Ali Soufan (Fajer Al-Kaisi), an FBI agent assigned to the Bureau's Osama bin Laden unit, ""I-49""; and an unnamed New York Times reporter (Matthew Rhys), to whom Jones considers leaking classified material.Although The Report doesn't repeat anything specifically depicted elsewhere, it does cover some of the same general narrative ground as The Looming Tower (2018) and Vice (2018) - Soufan, for example, is in both this film and Looming Tower, and although Dick Cheney and George W. Bush (the central characters in Vice), appear don't here, they hover constantly on the margins, hidden from sight but everywhere apparent. It's also worth mentioning that, as with both The Looming Tower and Vice, The Report is a left-centric narrative, especially in terms of its depiction of EIT and how the CIA lied and falsified data.The depiction of Mitchell and Jessen is particularly condemning (we know from the get-go that Mitchell is an idiot because he refers to himself in the third-person). If the film has any villains, it's these two; snake-oil salesmen with psychology degrees but no experience of actual interrogations and no data to back up their claims that torture works (because no such data exists). Indeed, this element of the film was deeply personal to Burns, both of whose parents are psychologists. As he explains to PBS, he found it abhorrent that ""people had figured out a way to weaponise psychology"", which he believes is a tool that ""exists to help people"". Mitchell and Jessen are shown as enjoying the experience of hurting these people - their justification for doing so (that such interrogation will save lives) exposed as utterly fabricated. At one point, Jones reports to Feinstein that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed had been waterboarded 183 times without any results, prompting her to ask, ""if it works, why did they need to do it 183 times?"" Why indeed.The film makes no bones about just how ineffective EIT actually was, and how full of garbage Mitchell and Jessen were, despite some Republicans maintaining to this day that it saved lives. In this sense, the audience is made privy to all the useful and accurate information gleaned from EIT - nothing, zero, nada, no thing, not even one thing. As per the Panetta Review (2009), the CIA's own internal inquiry, not a single piece of solid intel was ever extracted from any detainee in the program. Indeed, the contrary was true - EIT led to detainees shutting down or providing false information, or information they knew the CIA already possessed. As Jones states, ""all they did was make it impossible to prosecute mass murderers.""Also emphasised is the CIA's attempts to provide legal justification for EIT, with the so-called Torture Memos cropping up a few times. Perhaps the most significant rationale in the Memos is that the program can only be legal if it resulted in ""unique, otherwise unavailable"" intelligence. Or, as Bernadette says in the film, ""it's only legal if it works."" With this in mind, the film depicts the CIA as hedging their bets - gambling that people won't care how the information was obtained if such information leads to the capture or death of bin Laden (which it did not).Thematically, although the film examines multiple politically charged themes, for the most part, its thematic concerns are understated. For example, the Republicans who oppose the Report adopt a stance of ""admit nothing, deny everything, make counter accusations"". The filmmakers, of course, had no idea that their movie would be in cinemas concurrently with a House Intelligence Committee impeachment inquiry into the actions of the current president, Donald Trump, who has adopted an identical position from his first day in office. This parallel is never explicitly addressed, but it's right there for those willing to see it. It's also important insofar as one of the film's most salient themes is that the CIA's flagrant disregard for the rule of law, the Constitution, and basic human rights must never again be allowed to happen. This is not to suggest that Trump has sanctioned torture (although at this point, would it surprise anyone), rather to illustrate how quickly we forget the lessons of yesterday.Although it's mentioned on several occasions that Jones's team and the Report itself must avoid partisan politics, like so many aspects of life in the US, the investigation and debate regarding publication split along broadly partisan lines - the Intelligence Committee voted to publish the Executive Summary by a vote of 9-6; the eight Democrats and Olympia Snowe against six Republicans. John McCain was a member of the Committee ex officio, and so didn't have a vote, but made it known he agreed with the Democrats and Snowe. On the other hand, neither Obama nor John Kerry were overjoyed about releasing even a redacted version, and McDonagh wanted more redactions than were ultimately used. Also in service of a balanced depiction, the film references Feinstein's disdain for Edward Snowden and whistle-blowers in general. It's to the film's credit that it doesn't shy away from such opinions, thus avoiding an overly neat dichotomy of Democrat=good/Republican=bad.Despite its importance, however, I can't see The Report packing them in at the multiplex. For one, it's exceptionally talky. I would argue that this simply positions the film in the theatrical tradition, but I can certainly understand people regarding it as one step removed from an audio recording of the actual Report. There's also a distinct lack of emotion - every time Jones begins to emote, somebody shuts him down. Along the same lines, there's no character development - we learn nothing about anyone beyond their involvement or connection with EIT and the Report; we never see where they live, we never see family members, we're not made privy to who they are as people. This is by design of course, with Burns wanting to focus on the facts, but again, I can understand people finding it unsatisfactory. All of this results in a dry and sterile film that leans entirely on its procedural elements, which certainly won't be to everyone's taste.The Report is a straightforward and restrained film, in which Burns's focus is razor-sharp and unwavering. Depicting how EIT shamed the nation, betraying the very values that were supposedly being fought for in the first place, the film excoriates both the Bush administration for letting it happen and the Obama administration for its reluctance to make it public. It's not exactly exciting in a traditional sense, but it sure is compelling; a story that's infuriating insofar as it actually happened, horrifying insofar as, given the clown currently in the Oval Office, it could easily happen again.",The Report

The CIA hired two psychologists who came up with EIT- Enhanced Interrogation Techniques which promised to obtain information from prisoners. Their so called techniques were nothing more than torture and the CIA learned nothing of importance from the 119 prisoners. The two psychologists had no actual data to back up their claims that EIT was effective, they were morons who walked away with $80 million in taxpayers money.

59,eelen-seth,Angry and relevant,7,29 October 2019,"'The Report' couldn't get made at a better time. With everything happening in today's American and global political climate, it shows how little the general public actually is allowed to know about whatever happens within the borders of their government buildings. An entire country is at stake when secrets come out, that shouldn't have been secrets in the first place when laws get executed correctly.Idealistic Senate staffer Daniel J. Jones (Adam Driver), gets tasked by his boss, Senator of California Diane Feinstein (Annette Bening), to lead an investigation into the CIA's post 9/11 Detention and Interrogation Program. Jones' relentless pursuit of the truth leads to findings that uncover the lengths to which the nation's top intelligence agency went to destroy evidence, subvert the law, and hide a shocking secret from the American public.Scott Z. Burns hasn't directed a feature length film since 2006's 'Pu-239'. Having previously written films such as, 'The Laundromat', 'Side Effects' and 'Contagion', it seems he has a very good work relationship with this films' producer Steven Soderbergh (director of last named films). With 'The Report' he knows what he's going for and doesn't hold back on any occasion. The story goes off like a missile, and only slows down when hitting its target at the finish line. That might be a challenge for some viewers, but the suspense throughout the second and third act is rare and delivers what political polymaths are looking for. To those who aren't particularly interested in politics and cover-ups, this might be a tough one to sit through.Adam Driver, is truly on a roll these last couple of years. With two more films on the horizon in the last two months of 2019 ('Marriage Story' and 'Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker'), it seems there's no stopping him in becoming one of the most talented actors of this generation. He shows just how focused and career driven he is as his character Daniel J. Jones. He's unsurpassed and will definitely get recognition for his hard work coming awards season.What plays like a political 'Social Network', could've benefited from a rewrite by Aaron Sorkin, just to streamline it a bit more. The dialogues are heavy and littered with dark humour, but without any real character development, it misses the opportunity to make the audience connect with anyone on a deeper level. You never get to look behind the suits into their homes. The mental struggles of being accused of whistleblowing and torturing people, must take its toll on politicians and CIA-agents, no? We get little hints at their personal lives when being interrogated by government officials, but this is all just small talk. It does go without saying, Greg O'Bryant deserves much praise for editing this film. I wonder how long the rough cut must've been.There's a wide range of well known actors passing by as fundamental characters in the big scheme of things. Annette Bening, brilliant actor taking on the full look and characteristics of Senator Feinstein, doesn't have many explosive scenes to wow, but is subtly captivating. Corey Stoll, Jon Hamm, Maura Tierney and Michael C. Hall all have important parts to keep things moving, but with the little amount of screen time fail to impress with anything more than acceptable.Burns' 'The Report' is an important watch, delivering facts in a striking manner. It's worth watching for Driver's performance alone, observing a man who loves doing his job and excels at it. A history lesson in American politics and terrorism with a little dig at propaganda filmmaking and journalism, and a big spotlight on the CIA's misconduct.",The Report

It is well written, well shot and foremost it actually makes you think about important questions which makes it stand out because most of the ""bigger"" movies these days don't.

First of all that's their universal excuse for everything. And more importantly it is a statement that is just dismissive without having any actual fact or argument. It is basically like a child sticking his fingers into his ears screaming: La La La La La I can't hear you.Torture in unethical. That not really up for debate because that what the United States says itself. That this is not a measure that is appropriate because this makes you as worse as the people you're trying to catch. In the movie the CIA prepares its case should it come to a legal battle with the argument that what they are doing is right as long as it is effective. It doesn't matter if it is effective.

The most troubling fact beyond the atrocities committed against suspected terrorists was the subsequent cover up committed by the CIA. Adam Driver delivers an outstanding performance as Daniel Jones, the individual tasked to research claims of wrong doing. Also, it was unsettling that part of the cover up was supported by members of Congress because it could create political ramifications.

And the worst truth that came from this movie was the fact that no one within the CIA or in our Administration (who were aware of or even supported the CIA) was punished as a result of the findings.",The Report

It interested me so much because, as a grad student in Psychology in the '60s, I often thought that some of my colleagues would have jumped happily at the chance to become monsters like Mitchell and Jessen. That said, I have reservations about seeing this story as a dramatic film with major stars. The same dialogue that so skillfully at least touches upon every relevant point, comes off as somewhat artificial. We, the public, are not accustomed to such fidelity to the facts in a dramatic film. Hence, the lessons are too easy to dismiss. (For similar reasons, I preferred the recent RBG documentary to ON THE BASIS OF SEX.) A related development just outside the scope of this film is the gyrations within the AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION caused by the ""enhanced interrogation"" scandal. Its ethical code was so vague that Mitchell and Jessen arguably had not violated it. Apparently, psychologists were available for dirty work physicians could not do because of the Hippocratic Oath.",The Report

Burns (whose script credits include The Bourne Ultimatum and No Time To Die) in a talky yet engrossing drama intentionally reminiscent of All The President's Men. Tasked by Senator Dianne Feinstein (a coolly commanding Annette Bening) with leaving no stone unturned, Jones - infused here with simmering indignation by a driven Adam Driver - systematically details the brutalities inflicted on all of the Agency's 119 detainees. Having assembled his torture dossier, though, Jones faces another uphill struggle to get it published. As Matthew Rhys' reporter ruefully observes, ""they sent you off to build a boat they had no intention of sailing."" As vessels go, The Report is one so overloaded with names, dates, flashbacks and acronyms it's a wonder it stays afloat. That it does should be attributed not just to the dogged conviction Driver exudes as its righteous hero but also to the film's unshakeable belief that the ugly truth will ultimately out. Burns' film is not an easy watch, not least when it depicts what took place in Langley's infamous ""black sites"". Like the harrowing data that inspired it, though, it defies redaction.",The Report

I liked the poster and the plot, it kind of reminded me of The post (2017) also the first season of The Newsroom. I loved both so it was easy for me to give it a shot and it was worth it.The film follows Daniel Jones going through CIA's report. We get to see the events chronologically as he discovers one thing after another. After the terrorist attack CIA is afraid that similar things might happen, out of that fear they made some rash decision and things get complicated fast. Now the CIA is torturing and calling it crucial to stop terrorism. The atrocities done by CIA is shown pretty early on the film because the film is not about the truth but getting the truth out. I do not know much about the events nor the timeline of those event. In 2009 I saw the film New York which showed the torture being done in the same manner so it must have been a common knowledge back in 2009 that detainees were being tortured. The film focuses on the uphill battle towards admitting those deeds.The acting is superb. The character felt real. It was shown in sort of documentary style no over the top drama was shown. As a film this is a well-paced, well-acted, entertaining film with likable lead.One of the things that I really liked was there were no super villains or some unrealistic ploys to stop the report from getting published. All the actions were logical so it creates a tension of a different kind. Not having any political knowledge of the said events helped enjoy the film because I did not know what will happen in the end. The dialogues are another strength of this film.

85,michaeldoud,First Hit: A strong film shining a light on the United States of America's illegal torture campaign.,7,3 December 2019,"First Hit: A strong film shining a light on the United States of America's illegal torture campaign.Daniel J. Jones (Adam Driver) wants to be a part of our government, so he meets with Denis McDonough (John Hamm), who is Chief of Staff in the White House. McDonough's advice is to get involved with a project of importance and make a name for yourself.Working as a Senate staffer for Senator Diane Feinstein (Annette Bening), he is selected and enthusiastically agrees to investigate the 2005 destruction of CIA interrogation videotapes for her. His life is his work, and he's dedicated to finding out the truth.Reviewing online documents, Jones discovers damning evidence that the CIA used ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" (torture) as promoted by Bruce Jessen (T. Ryder Smith) and James Elmer Mitchell (Douglas Hodge) at secret, ""black"" (hidden offshore), locations. It appears that the videotapes were destroyed to conceal evidence that the US violated the Geneva Convention rules against torture.The reason the CIA contracted with Jessen and Mitchell is that they believed they could get information out of captured personnel that would stop future terrorist bombings like 9/11 and maybe apprehend the individuals that instigated 9/11.In a windowless high-security office in an offsite facility, Jones and 5 others reviewed 6 million pages of CIA materials only to discover that these contractors imprisoned and tortured some 119 detainees and got no valuable information. Their techniques were a total failure.The move to legalize this program was shown in scenes with White House staff working with John Yoo (Pun Bandhu), who made legal arguments that later were discovered to be unfounded and unsupported.There are graphic scenes of the torture which aren't easy to watch, but what really stood out to me was the lack of guts on the part of Senators (including Feinstein) and Congressmen to expose and publicly bring to light our failings and illegal actions. The politicians, who represent us, were mainly worried about being re-elected. Finally, because of political pressure and worries that the information would be leaked to the press, the information is shared with the public.The film does a great job of intermixing real footage, like John McCain talking about how torture is an anti-American value on the Senate floor, with the story.Driver is sublime as Jones. His focus and willingness to push all bounds to get the information and get it correct was phenomenal. The film did state that Jones' full report was some seven-thousand pages long. Bening was excellent as Feinstein as she got her voice and mannerisms down perfectly. However, what disappointed me was how Feinstein seems to play politics for sake of her job instead of getting the truth out. Scott Z. Burns wrote and directed this film with a clear focus of showing how the CIA was exposed and how politics almost keep the facts from US Citizens.Overall: Although I wasn't surprised by the actions of the CIA, Senators, and The White House, it's disappointing to see how we try to hide our horrible and illegal behavior.",The Report

🏆(Oscar potential for Supporting Actress Annette Bening)The Report (Scott Z.

Incredibly informative, the narrative film reaches an audience a documentary wouldn't. Adam Driver feels natural for the lead role but Annette Bening's supporting performance as real-life Senator Dianne Feinstein is truly noteworthy.

116,schlomo-jones,"An well-done counter narrative to ""Zero Dark Thirty"" but leaves too much out, and gives too much credit to Feinstein",8,14 January 2020,"This was an interesting and well made film about the use of torture by the CIA during the Bush presidency after 9/11, and the Senate investigation into its use once Democrats gained the lead.The focus is on young, idealistic Senate staffer Dan Jones working under Diane Feinstein, played excellently by Adam Driver. Much of the acting is great, however, the script and dialogue is very wooden. Every character here is strictly business at every second, and very dry and humorless, which I find unnatural. Private conversations between individuals, especially those on the same side, do not resemble senate hearings or press conferences, and this clinical approach to the events held the film back a bit.The politics I question. On the one hand, it offers a counter-narrative to the CIA propaganda film ""Zero Dark Thirty"" which, after Osama Bin-Laden was reported killed during Obama's presidency, was released and pushed the line that it was only possible due to the enhanced-interrogation techniques (Aka torture, or gross violations of human rights). That narrative was one the CIA and Dick Cheney pushed hard after OBL's assassination. This movie offers the alternative view that torture was not only illegal, but it didn't work and no useful information was gained from it, including the location of OBL, which was already known through other sources.Ultimately, we are shown that politics triumphed over principle and those who committed these atrocities avoided any accountability and consequences, thus remaining in the system to do it all over when Trump and the GOP took back the government.Of course there are huge gaping holes in this narrative that are highly problematic. The most obvious is that it portrays Dan, along with Dianne Feinstein as the sole hero on this quest to expose torture that was being covered up and no one knowing about it. The fact is, everyone knew about it. EIT and torture were widely discussed and debated in the early 2000's with many former intelligence and military people publicly speaking out against it on mainstream media. There were also a huge number of activists and human rights attorneys during this period who exposed many of the crimes against humanity committed in the name of combatting terrorism.They completely leave out the fact that Feinstein voted not once, but twice for the PATRIOT act, destroying civil liberties and due process which allowed people to commit this torture in the first place. She also voted for the IRAQ war. The idea that she is some champion of truth is utterly absurd. She only took this position too little too late.It's almost unheard of for incoming administrations to prosecute previous ones. It's also practically unheard of for the US military or intelligence community to ever face any consequences for their human rights violations against foreigners. It's why the US is not a signatory to the International Criminal Court.The fact is, the CIA has been murdering people, torturing people and overthrowing democratically elected governments for decades. The FBI has been destroying labor movements, smearing ad assassinating leftists leaders and progressives like MLK, jr. for decades. None of these people are the good guys, irrespective of which party is in power. This film does a disservice by glossing over this truth with partisan politics.",The Report

The movie completely whitewashes this fact and pretends Feinstein was just this innocent who *shockingly* finds out later. She was part of the SIC, after all.Jose Rodriguez (CIA Chief) briefed Pelosi and the Senate Intelligence committee in *2002*, and they were cool with what the CIA was doing. Rodriguez gives specifics as to who was there and when this occurred.Whether you believe the CIA was right or wrong in what they did, to pretend the Democrats were innocent in this is complete BS, and is revisionist history.I think these facts have to be taken into account in the rating of a movie like this. Either it's accurate, or it's not. After all, part of the movie is in the writing, and if the writing isn't accurate in a ""true story"", then it's not a true story.As far as the movie itself, it has decent pacing, and the actors portraying the politicians are very good, however you end up leaving a bit unsatisfied.

Now that I've gotten that out of the way, I'd like to review the movie itself.I don't see how anyone can call this story partisan or ""liberal."" The investigation was ordered by a Democrat. That fact is inescapable so you're going to hear the story from that point of view. Aside from that fact, I found the story to be quite fair and equally critical of both Republican and Democratic administrations, as well as equally favorable of certain Republican and Democratic Senators. It also provides a pretty solid argument for both perspectives: those who approved of the ""advanced interrogation techniques"" and those opposed. This movie was about the events, the subsequent investigation, and how certain people across two administrations responded to it. Political leanings are irrelevant. I thought the film did a great job of drawing that line.The pace of the film was quite good given the administrative and paperwork-heavy nature of the 7-year investigation on which it's based. The torture scenes were uncomfortable to watch as they should be; a stark reminder of what ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" actually means.I also found the acting superb. Levine as Brennan and Bening as Feinstein were particularly stellar. And I feel like I'm the only one who likes Adam Driver these days but I thought he was the perfect choice to play Daniel Jones. The passion, intensity and righteous indignation he brought to the role made me feel the same frustration I imagine Jones must have felt.This is an important story regardless of your political beliefs. I think it's worth a watch, especially if you're unfamiliar with how the events unfolded and why there was such a fundamental disagreement at the time between opponents and proponents of the practice.",The Report

The subtelty and almost mechanical approach to telling this narrative offers an even pace without losing sight of the intrigue it aims to deliver. In the hands of a lesser cast, this movie would have been a failure. Howver, when Annette Bening, Jon Hamm (although rather briefly), and the ever so wonderful Adam Driver are combined, the value they add to a story is clear. Driver's rendition of an ethical, detail-oriented, and honest Daniel Jones, makes the viewer feel as if they are watching the wheels and cogs turn in the mind of a real person. That is not surprising, as I am yet to watch Driver perform and be anywhere less than in awe of his acting chops. If you ever want to explain to someone the meaning of accountibility, tell them to watch this movie, which shows that even the most up-there-cant-touch-me bodies in the most up-there cant-touch-me countries will have to answer for their actions, should there be a few people who dont lose a sight of whats right.
Furthermore, based on what I read afterwards - and let me tell you I fell down a rabbit hole of related material after watching this- it seems to be pretty true to the real-events that inspired the movie.

The film raises a number of questions about the extent to which oversight is needed when it comes to ensuring that the government controls its agencies, and not the other way around.As for the idea that torture is essential to winning the War on Terror, I am reminded of the verse Mark 8:36: ""For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, but lose his soul?""

184,dat_pino,BORING,1,30 December 2019,Drenched in politically motivated drivel attempting to once again make 'Republicans' and government big brother appear to be an enemy. Attempts to draw sympathy for terrorists. Reading through the reviews it appears it has successfully done so for a small population. My wife asked me to turn the movie off before it was half way through. A complete waste of time. Love the main actor. Bad part.,The Report
