0,MartinHafer,One of the worst films I admit to having seen on the big screen!,2,19 July 2006,"Years ago, when I was a poor teenager, my best friend and my brother both had a policy that the person picking the movie should pay. And, while I would never pay to see some of the crap they took me to, I couldn't resist a free trip to the movies! That's how I came to see crap like the second Conan movie and NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN! Now, despite this being a wretched movie, it is in places entertaining to watch--in a brain dead sort of way. And, technically the stunts and camera-work are good, so this elevates my rating all the way to a 2! So why is the movie so bad? Well, unlike the first Rambo movie, this one has virtually no plot, Rambo himself only says about 3 words (other than grunts and yells), there is a needless and completely irrelevant and undeveloped ""romance"" and the movie is one giant (and stupid) special effect. And what STUPIFYINGLY AWFUL special effects. While 12383499143743701 bullets and rockets are shot at Rambo, none have any effect on him and almost every bullet or arrow Rambo shoots hits its mark! And, while the bad guys are using AK-47s, helicopters and rockets, in some scenes all Rambo had is a bow and arrows with what seem like nuclear-powered tips!! The scene where the one bad guy is shooting at him as he slowly and calmly launches one of these exploding arrows is particularly made for dumb viewers! It was wonderfully parodied in UHF starring Weird Al. Plus, HOT SHOTS, PART DEUX also does a funny parody of the genre--not just this stupid scene.All-in-all, a movie so dumb and pointless, it's almost like self-parody!",Rambo - First Blood Part II
1,bkoganbing,Rambo Goes Home,6,24 October 2009,"After the havoc and mayhem that Rambo wreaked on the Pacific Northwest simply because some redneck cops wouldn't leave him alone, it was only a matter of time before the US government would have need of his special services. So in Rambo: First Blood Part II Richard Crenna who was his trainer and former commanding officer in Vietnam gets him released from prison. He's being sent back to Vietnam to search for prisoners left behind.The whole POW thing I've never quite fathomed. After a war is over would it make any rational sense for any government to keep prisoners? To feed and clothe him and watch over them even at subsistence levels seems to me to be a colossal waste of time and effort. Still the stories of POWs left from Vietnam in Vietnam still surface.Rambo's only going in to scout, take pictures to provide proof, but this is Rambo and he's going to go above and beyond. I mean what are they going to do to him, throw him back in jail?Stallone has to fight the Vietnamese in front of him and some people who are not giving him full support in the rear. He also gets time for a little romance in Part II, lovely Julia Nickson who is a pro-American, anti-Communist guerrilla still waging the fight there.Sly's fans will no doubt appreciate this film and we in America can be confident that those POWs Stallone doesn't free, Chuck Norris will.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
2,Leofwine_draca,Insanely violence jungle war adventure,9,22 October 2016,"The first film in the Rambo series, FIRST BLOOD, was a taut and realistic thriller that used the plight of Vietnam veterans as a basis for a survival adventure film. The sequel, RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD PART II, is an all-out-action, over-the-top jungle adventure film that uses the plight of Vietnam veterans and POWs as a basis for an OTT thrill ride. Made in the same year as the similarly outrageous COMMANDO, this is very much a 'guy' film – it's over-the-top, frequently unbelievable, and packed with all manner of violence and mayhem to get crowds whooping. It may not be very politically correct, and yes, it may glorify violence – but it makes for one heck of a watch! Stallone has long been a favourite of mine and he once again shows why he's such a top star. Physically, he's a man mountain who you believe can easily wipe out a Vietcong jungle outpost single-handedly. Emotionally, he runs deep, using his eyes to transmit his feelings in a low key turn. I've loved jungle films for as long as I can remember and this film makes great use of them as we watch Rambo tracking and eliminating his enemies one at a time.Much of the action is saved for the unbelievable final half hour, in which the carnage reaches outlandish levels as Rambo uses rocket launchers, exploding arrows, a helicopter, and his trusty machine gun to tackle the enemy. A supporting cast of dependables putting in decent turns – Crenna, Napier, Berkoff – adds to the fun. My only complaint is with the music, which is frequently underused. A loud, stirring soundtrack of the kind featured in RAMBO (2008) would have enhanced this film no end, but they frequently miss the cues. Nevertheless RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD PART II is a film you can really get your teeth into: light, airy, full of explosions and death. They don't make 'em like this any more, God bless 'em.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
3,SnoopyStyle,More explosions and more kills,6,10 October 2014,Col. Samuel Trautman (Richard Crenna) offers John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) an opportunity to recon for POWs in Vietnam with the possibility of a pardon and get out of hard labor prison. Marshall Murdock (Charles Napier) wants him to only take photographs for proof. Trautman is suppose to follow up with the rescue. Only he couldn't leave a prisoner being crucified and rescues him. He escapes with the help of freedom fighter Co Bao. However Murdock orders them to abort the operation and Rambo is captured. Co Bao helps Rambo escape the camp co-run by Vietnamese Captain Vinh and Russian Lieutenant Colonel Padovsky.This is a well-made B-movie. It's too bad that they have taken a compelling complicated character and turned him into a cartoon. The action is bigger with more kills. He gets to blow stuff up and shoot a lot of people. It's an overblown popcorn movie.,Rambo - First Blood Part II
4,kosmasp,More blood (letting),7,11 November 2019,"When I was a kid and I watched the first Rambo and this one, I thought the order was wrong. Here Rambo goes to war in the first one he came back from one. Well I was clueless what can I say. It's also not like I saw any social commentary or understood what PTSD is. I know I probably was too young to have watched them, but that I also did not know at the time.Having rewatched the first three again recently, I remembered them and my memory got freshened up on a lot of things too. The action is pretty stellar in this one and we get some recognizable characters back and some new ones added. Now the main twist is very predictable, but the movie still works despite that. I remember the horror I felt when the slugs scene came up. But I learned about the salt ""trick"" too - not that I got a chance to use it (thankfully).",Rambo - First Blood Part II
5,gavin6942,Rambo Kills People,6,18 February 2006,"This is what I expected a Rambo movie to be. Rambo, now a prison convict, is sent back to Vietnam in 1985 to look for POWs. The government is hoping he finds none, but unfortunately for them he turns up a Hanoi Hilton. Well, except John McCain isn't there. The government is ashamed and ditches Rambo. So the next hour of the movie? Shooting, booby-trapping and helicoptering. And this time, he has a rocket launcher.If you liked the first film, you'll like this one. More of the same action, pacing. Even a bit of romance, but not too much. And of course, Richard Crenna returns as Colonel Trautman - again in his matter-of-fact voice warning the government what they're up against.The only complaint I have about this film is the subtle politics of it. Rambo wants ""to win this time"", which opens wounds about the Vietnam war that need not be reopened. It implies he felt America was doing the right thing, which many now won't agree with. But ignoring this, it's a fine film of a man who wants to save his comrades from certain death - and that's very admirable. This film is recommended.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
6,jboothmillard,Rambo: First Blood Part II,5,26 February 2008,"First Blood was the more grounded introduction to the leading character, the second most famous from ""Sly"", along with Rocky, but it was this sequel and its next follow-up that cemented the image of the action hero we all recognise today, from Razzie nominated director George P. Cosmatos (Escape to Athena, Cobra, Tombstone). Basically, three years after the events in Hope, Washington, former US Army John Rambo (Razzie winning Sylvester Stallone, also writing) is visited by his old commander, Colonel Samuel ""Sam"" Trautman (Richard Crenna). The Vietnam War is over and concerning news has spread that a small group of US POWs have been left in enemy custody in Vietnam. The US government has authorized a solo infiltration mission to confirm the reports. Rambo agrees to undertake the operation in exchange for a pardon. Once in Thailand, he meets bureaucratic government official Marshall Murdock (Charles Napier) who is overseeing the operation. Rambo is temporarily reinstated into the US Army and instructed only to take photographs of his findings and not to rescue any prisoners or engage the enemy, a better equipped extraction team will return later. Rambo is forced to lose his guns and most of his equipment when a problem occurs with his parachute jump during the drop, leaving him with only knives and his bow and arrow. He meets his assigned contact, young intelligence agent Co Phuong Bao (twice Razzie nominated newcomer Julia Nickson), who has arranged with local pirates to take them upriver. Reaching the camp, Rambo finds one of the prisoners, Banks (Andy Wood), being tortured, against orders he rescues him. They are discovered during their escape by Vietnamese troops and attacked, and the pirates betray them. Rambo kills the pirates and destroys the gunboat with a rocket launcher while the POW and Co swim to safety. But when the trio reach the extraction point, their rescue helicopter is ordered by Murdock to abort, saying Rambo has violated his orders. Co escapes, but Rambo and Banks are recaptured and returned to the camp. Trautman confronts Murdock, who reveals that he never intended to save any POWs if any should be found, but to leave them to save Congress the money it would take to buy their freedom and evade any possibility of further war. Rambo learns that Soviet troops are arming and training the Vietnamese. He is interrogated by Lieutenant Colonel Sergei T. Podovsky (Steven Berkoff) and his right-hand man Sergeant Yushin (Voyo Goric). Upon learning of Rambo's mission, Podovsky demands that Rambo broadcast a message warning against further rescue missions for POWs or there will be further deaths. Meanwhile, Co infiltrates the camp disguised as a prostitute and comes to the hut in which Rambo is held captive. Rambo at first refuses to cooperate but relents when the prisoner he tried to save is threatened. But instead of reading the scripted comments, Rambo directly threatens Murdock, then attacks and subdues the Soviets with Co's help and they escape into the jungle. Rambo agrees to take Co to the United States, when suddenly a small Vietnamese force attacks the pair. Co is killed, an enraged Rambo kills the soldiers and buries Co in the mud. Rambo intercepts Yushin's helicopter, climbs on board, throws Yushin and the pilot out and takes control. He lays waste to the prison camp and kills all the remaining enemy forces before extracting the POWs and heading towards friendly territory in Thailand. Podovsky pursuing in a helicopter gunship, he causes Rambo to crash, but he survives and uses a rocket launcher to destroy the aircraft, killing Podovsky. Returning to base with the POWs, Rambo uses the helicopter's machine gun to destroy Murdock's office. He then confronts the terrified Murdock with his knife, demanding that he rescue the remaining POWs. Trautman tries to convince Rambo to return home now that he has been pardoned, but he refuses. Trautman asks what he wants, an angry Rambo responds that he only wants his country to love its soldiers as much as its soldiers love it. Rambo tells Trautman he will live ""day by day"" and walks off into the distance. Also starring George Kee Cheung as Lieutenant Tay, Martin Kove as Michael Reed Ericson and William Ghent as Captain Vinh. Stallone embodies the iconic image, with the long hair, red bandana, flexing his muscles and bullet belts across his chest, cartoonish and implausibly indestructible, but ready to pack a punch, and there is reasonable support from Napier and Berkoff as villains on opposite sides. You could argue that this a pre-Vietnam war movie, it is certainly a mission you can go along with, a seemingly one-man rescue mission behind enemy lines, with plenty of explosions, guns blazing and a lot of bloody kills, ridiculous and completely different to the first entry, yes, hence the Razzie wins, but an entertaining action. It was nominated the Oscar Best Sound Effects Editing, and it won the Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Screenplay for Sylvester Stallone, James Cameron and Kevin Jarre, and Worst Original Song for ""Peace in Our Life"". It was number 100 on The 100 Greatest War Films. Worth watching!",Rambo - First Blood Part II
7,rmax304823,A Celebration of Sarcomeres.,2,9 May 2009,"I don't see much reason to get into this movie in much detail. Sylvester Stallone is once again John Rambo, author and survivor of ""A Season in Hell"", recruited from prison by his only friend, Major Richard Crenna, to secretly return to Vietnam, take photos of the American prisoners believed to be still held in horrible camps, and return without engaging the enemy.Fat chance. What if he actually DID nothing more than sneak in, take pics, and sneak out? Who would come to see the movie? It's essentially a celebration of Stallone's muscles. Preparing for his mission, we see his well-oiled muscles bulging. (They are oiled and bulging throughout.) There is the ritual strapping on of black leather, ugly guns, and even uglier knives. The black guns are cleaned, assembled with loud clacks, and almost as oiled as Stallone's muscles. The bow is tested and, yes, it has enough poundage to drive a bolt through an enemy's forehead. The knife is sharpened with slick snicks.Stallone and one of his POWs are betrayed by one or two of the suits from Washington, cynical politicians who, you can bet, were never even in a fist fight in grammar school. No guts, you know? Just sit around with their feet on the desk and drink foreign beer.The movie does what it set out to do, but what it set out to do is meretricious. It deliberately cashes in on the myth popular in the mid-1980s that there were uncountable numbers of MIAs quietly kept in wretched camps by the North Vietnamese. The bumper stickers were ubiquitous. (Free Our MIAs.) Why would they keep them? It was never quite reasoned out but perhaps to turn the POWs into a slave labor force -- in a country that has absolutely no resource other than labor. Or maybe for their propaganda value as an instrument to humiliate the United States -- a propaganda weapon that the Vietnamese kept secret from the world.As a captive, Rambo is treated in a Medieval fashion by the North Vietnamese. Dipped to his neck in pig excrement and then hauled out of it by his wrists, his muscles still on display. Then, not content with subhuman Vietnamese, a Russian officer is brought in to play the part of the Gestapo officer -- ""Vee haff vays of MAKING you remember."" A high-tech type, the Russian uses psychology and electricity, not just pig dump.Rambo returns and declares that he intends to drift aimlessly until ""this country loves us as much as we love it,"" bringing up another myth that Vets returning from Vietnam were uniformly spat upon and cursed, which is why I guess we elected so many to the Congress and appointed others to high-echelon positions. The last three losing presidential candidates were among that despised group. At least Rambo's aimless drifting left room open for a sequel, which arrived apace.The action movies with Schwarzenegger and Willis and others were leavened by wisecracks but Rambo is humorless. It marches dully through it's phantasmal ideological swamp, killing without mercy, barely speaking, barely able to speak. To speak is a sign of weakness.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
8,ma-cortes,Exciting and moving Rambo episode in which he returns at Vietnam to rescue American prisoners,6,12 August 2010,"Violent movie that launched Stallone career going on his successful Rambo episodes . Sylvester Stallone as brawny hero Rambo is a previous Green Beret who's forced to go Cambodia in search of American POWs . He frees the American MIAs but Vietcong soldiers sett off in pursuit and Rampo leads his pursuers into all kinds of booby snares , puts dangerous traps in the jungle woods and mountains . Rambo appears threatening , lurking and harassing to his enemies pursuers escaping the innumerable risks and dangers . Rambo is double-crossed but his former superior ,Richard Crenna, will attempt to help him .From the beginning to the end the comic-book action-packed and extreme violence is continued and it's fast movement ; for that reason the picture is pretty amusing ; furthermore contains lots of explosions and some unintentionally comic dialog too . The outdoors are spectaculars , the landscapes have been filmed on location in Acapulco, Guerrero, Mexico (waterfall scene)and in Tecoanapa, Guerrero, Mexico . Stallone is enormous as the tough and rebel ex soldier and Richard Crenna is top notch as the former trainer officer. Appears notorious secondaries as Martin Kove , Charles Napier, Steven Berkoff and screen debut of Julia Nickson , David Soul's wife . Awesome and exceptional cinematography by the classic cameraman Jack Cardiff . Again a splendid and rousing musical score by the great maestro Jerry Goldsmith . The motion picture is preceded by the original ¨First blood¨ by Ted Kotcheff in which Rambo is falsely accused as vagrant and wrongfully imprisoned and he pull off the break-out . And followed by ¨Rambo III¨ with Kurtwood Smith and Spiros Focas and of course Richard Crenna , in which Rambo against the Russians who control a particular sector of Afghanistan and he goes behind Russian-dominated enemy lines too rescue his former coroner from jail . The trilogy was a completed by the recent ¨Rambo¨ , a definitive improvement, with Julie Benz and directed by the same Stallone in which Rambo fights enemies in Thailand ; nevertheless the best considered is the original . The film will appeal to action enthusiast and Stallone fans . It's a movie for adrenaline lovers and frenetic thrillers buffs. Rating : Good, entertaining but violent , two thumbs up . This improbable and silly motion picture is professionally directed by George Pan Cosmatos. Although the movie has some aspects a little tough to take , this exciting film still has its moments. This large-scale and lavishly produced pic attempts a bemusing atmosphere with spectacular results.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
9,BA_Harrison,Do we get to win this time? Do bears **** in the woods?,8,12 September 2013,"Losing the Vietnam war was tough on the good ol' US of A; they'd never suffered the indignity of defeat before. Never mind, Hollywood could make it all betterTen years after the fall of Saigon, First Blood Part II sent Sylvester Stallone's John Rambo on a covert mission into Vietnam to locate some long forgotten POWs, during which the one-man army singlehandedly managed to even the score with the Vietcong, while also managing to stick the boot in to the Russkies at the same time. The film was just what the country needed to help improve its low self-esteem. Through the medium of film, America was back on top.While many critics here in the UK dismissed the film as worthless, jingoistic, ultra-violent, comic-book, wish-fulfilment garbage (with some even calling for it to be banned), I couldn't have disagreed more: politics aside, I found Rambo: First Blood Part II to be a hugely entertaining adventure film—extremely cheesy, perhaps, but great escapist fun. As Rambo cuts a swathe through the ridiculously loathsome Vietcong and Russian forces, it's easy to ignore the fact that the film is a right-wing piece of flag-waving propaganda, and simply revel in the sheer excess and silliness of the whole thing.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
10,paul_haakonsen,"To survive a war, you gotta become war...",7,3 February 2016,"""Rambo: First Blood Part II"" is a great step up in pace from the first movie ""First Blood"" from 1982. Director George P. Cosmatos managed to take the contents of the first movie and bring it back in part two, but also managed to spice it up quite a lot from the first movie.What worked out so well for ""Rambo: First Blood Part II"" was the fact that the movie took place in the jungle, where Rambo is now tracking down American POWs left behind. And it is so obviously clear that the Rambo character is right at home in a jungle setting.The story told in ""Rambo: First Blood Part II"" is somewhat of a continuation from the the first movie, but not a direct continuation. John Rambo is freed from prison on terms that he has to go to the jungles of Vietnam to look for American POWs left behind in hidden camps.There is a lot of action in this 1985 sequel and director George P. Cosmatos kicks off the movie into high gear almost from the very beginning, and the movie never really slows down. And the director managed to keep the movie interesting all throughout the course of the entire movie. So thumbs up to the director on that accomplishment.The cast list in ""Rambo: First Blood Part II"" was quite good, as it also was in the 1982 prequel. The cast list for part II included Richard Crenna (playing Col. Samuel Trautman), Charles Napier (playing Marshall Murdock), Steven Berkoff (playing Lt. Col. Podovsky) and Martin Kove (playing Ericson). And of course there is Sylvester Stallone in the iconic John Rambo character.If you enjoy action movies, then this 1985 movie is definitely a worthy addition to your movie collection. And if you were growing up during the 1980's then you should be more than familiar with ""Rambo: First Blood Part II"" already. And if you are not, then you should take the time to watch it, because it is an entertaining movie.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
11,Quinoa1984,"""Can we win this time?"" ""It's up to you.""",6,30 August 2010,"In the quote I featured above, spoken right before the opening credits begin for Rambo: First Blood Part II, made me immediately realize the difference between this film and its predecessor, First Blood. This time, we see a Rambo that reflects his own nation's mentality about combat, not just with Vietnam (though certainly losing the war doesn't help the esteem), and the film is about how Rambo can help WIN, in big capital f***-you-all letters. The ""it's up to you"" part seems like an interesting answer to Rambo, since we should be under the impression that the character is (or was) a loose cannon. Guess so much time away chipping at rocks doesn't slow a man's natural Green Beret ability to kill. After all, he's just going to take photographs of POW camps behind (""former"") enemy lines, right?This movie should be total BS, but somehow it is entertaining, at least some of the time. I liked how ultimately it became a reel almost, unintentionally, commenting on itself. The explosions are fantastic and out of this world, but believable in the comic-book/cartoon aspect of it. Rambo becomes such an action figure that one wonders where Skeletor is. I smiled whenever a character would fire at Rambo oh so poorly (the look on one's face looking like ""oh, damn, why am I firing so much?"") only to be blown away by a missile on the end of an arrow. I laughed incredibly when I got to watch the money shots of stuff blowing up so good that it nearly made Stallone's recent blow-stuff-up-real-good outing the Expendables like the retreading it is. Characters come on screen with the life of GI Joe, and why not after a while?The movie knows what it is, at least it does once one is acclimated to the style that Stallone is after. Ironically what Stallone is after in his portion of the script, the politics of it, is just silly and outdated 'hell-with-the-commies' stuff (it should also go without saying that he also made Rocky IV the same year). It's James Cameron's contributions, of the action and suspense, that make the movie so worthwhile, in spite of the face of logic that should be present. One can either go with the flow of it, or they can't. I mostly did. I ended up enjoying the spectacle of how fearless the macho jingoism became. What little dialog is in the movie is cut out of steroids. A character may die just the way you might expect - which in its own way makes it more surprising how expected it is ironically enough (you'll see what I mean when it comes). And by the time Rambo comes to his great conclusion, he may be more heroic, but in such a way that leaves no impact whatsoever. Rambo: First Blood Part II is mindless entertainment for a time of mindless action fans in the middle of a mindless but much touted Presidency like Regan's. It's up to Rambo? Does he have a choice? America for the WIN!",Rambo - First Blood Part II
12,BandSAboutMovies,"Ah, the 1980's...",7,21 August 2019,"When it came time to do a sequel to First Blood, there was a thought that Rambo needed a partner.Producers wanted John Travolta, but Stallone vetoed the idea. Lee Marvin (who almost played Colonel Trautman in the first film) was offered the role of Marshall Murdock, but declined.In fact, that sidekick character is in the first draft James Cameron wrote for this film. Stallone said of what he wrote, ""In his original draft it took nearly 30-40 pages to have any action initiated and Rambo was partnered with a tech-y sidekick.""What ended up on screen was very different.""Rambo, John J., born 7/6/47 Bowie, Arizona of Indian-German descent. Joined army 8/6/64. Accepted, Special Forces specialization, light weapons, cross-trained as medic. Helicopter and language qualified, 59 confirmed kills, two Silver Stars, four Bronze, four Purple Hearts, Distinguished Service Cross, Medal of Honor.""Yep - that's our hero. Given that he kills 74 people in just two days in this film, he's somehow more successful in Vietnam the second time. But we'll get to that.For now, it's been three years and Rambo is paying for his actions in the original movie when he's visited by Colonel Sam Trautman. Even though the Vietnam War is over, people remain convinced that POWs have been left behind. The government has authorized a solo mission to confirm if any are alive and Rambo is one of only three men suited for such a mission (who the other two are, I leave up to you, dear viewer, but if one of them isn't Thunder, I don't want to know about it).Marshall Murdock (Charles Napier) is the suit in charge that tells Rambo that all he has to do is take hotos, not rescue anyone or engage the enemy. As Rambo drops into enemy territory, his parachute becomes tangled, leaving him with only a knife and a bow. He doesn't need all those guns, trust me.A young intelligence agent named Co-Bao (Julia Nickson) and some pirates take Rambo up river, where he saves an American POW who has been crucified and left to die. The Vietnamese troops attack and the pirates betray Rambo, so he kills everyone. Rambo's extraction is cancelled, as Murdock says that Rambo has violated his orders and tells Trautman that he never intended for there to be any rescue - it would be too expensive and no one wants another war.Rambo is turned over to teh Soviet troops who are training the Vietnamese, Lieutenant Colonel Podovsky and Sergeant Yushin. They demand that he read the US government a message to stay away from future missions. Instead, he warns Murdock that he's coming for him. He escapes thanks to Co and they kiss, only for her to die seconds later.Rambo then becomes a slasher villain that we cheer for as he wipes out every single enemy one by one. He even steals a helicopter and uses it to destroy Murdock's office before demanding that the rest of the POWs get recued.Trautman then confronts Rambo and tries to convince him to return home, but our protagonist angrily replies that he only wants his country to love its soldiers as much as its soldiers love it.James Cameron claims that he only wrote the first draft of the script and that Sylvester Stallone made many changes to it. He claims that the star didn't like that the sidekick got all the cool dialogue and scrapped most of the POWs backstories.When the film was released, the political content of the movie was controversial, with many critics not ready to see any heroism in the Vietnam War. For his part, Cameron commented that he wrote the action and Stallone the politics.That said - at the time of the making of this film, there were 2,500 soldiers missing in action, so you can see where the sentiments were coming from. There were even reports that Delta Force operatives were in training to try and find those prisoners.Stallone explained the ending of the film quite passionately: ""I think that James Cameron is a brilliant talent, but I thought the politics were important, such as a right-wing stance coming from Trautman and his nemesis, Murdock, contrasted by Rambo's obvious neutrality, which I believe is explained in Rambo's final speech. I realize his speech at the end may have caused millions of viewers to burst veins in their eyeballs by rolling them excessively, but the sentiment stated was conveyed to me by many veterans.""This film was beloved by audiences worldwide just as much as it was savaged by critics. It won Worst Picture, Worst Actor, Worst Screenplay and Worst Song (""Peace In Our Time"" by Frank Stallone) in the Razzie Awards. It doesn't matter - it started an entire genre of military revenge pictures.Director George P. Cosmatos would go on to work with Stallone again on Cobra, as well as direct the films Leviathan and Tombstone. He was recommended for the film by Stallone's son Sage, who liked his movie Of Unknown Origin.This movie marks a true change from the way American audiences would view Vietnam and its veterans. It could have only been made in 1985, to be honest, and exists within that time to remind us of a completely different era.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
13,Coventry,Exponential increase of body-count.,4,25 October 2014,"I know that sequels to box-office hits are usually bigger and louder and bloodier, but this is just ridiculous beyond proportions! Ted Kotcheff's original Rambo (""First Blood"", in fact) was a little minimalistic masterpiece, whereas George P. Cosmatos' Rambo II is an enormously extravagant dud. ""First Blood"" was a very atypical but deeply compelling and thematic drama/action movie, with Sylvester Stallone as the lonely tormented lead character battling for reintegration and respect. In this second film, Rambo has purely become the brand-name that everybody associates with macho bloodshed, exploding biceps muscles and sadistic violence. Following his bizarre quest in rural Washington, John J. Rambo is serving time in prison when his friend and previous Vietnam officer Sam Trautman comes with a proposal. Rambo returns ""home"" to the tropic and moist jungle, on a secret mission to search for PoW's that are still in captivity even though the war ended several years ago. His assignment simply states that he should take photographic evidence of the prisoners, but passiveness isn't Rambo's style The clichéd and derivative plot, co-written by James Cameron, obviously foresees the most dim-witted twists, like crooked military superiors, helpful Asian female secret agents (who die just when they express their desire to emigrate to the United Sates) and bona fide evil Russian villains. Russians?!? What the hell are the Russians doing in 'Nam? ""First Blood Part II"" is an extremely violent and sick film, but also unintentionally hilarious with its inhumanly cruel torturing methods and endless machine gun sonatas. The body count in this film increases exponentially, with no less than 6700% in comparison to the first film, but there isn't the least bit of suspense or plausibility to detect anywhere. Parts II and III of the franchise are entertaining, if you switch off your brain functions, but in case you're looking for a truly good movie stick to the original.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
14,sunwarrior13,Rambo II Raises The Standard Of Violence,9,23 October 2011,"The second installment of First Blood,which is entitled Rambo II or Rambo: First Blood Part II, was released after the first film was a box office hit. The movie stars Sylvester Stallone, who plays his role as Vietnam veteran John Rambo.Aside from Stallone,the movie's cast includes Richard Crenna,Charles Napier,Steven Berkoff,Julia Nickson and Julian Turner.The movie was also directed by Stallone.The story,written by James Cameron and Stallone,picks up where the first film left.It is set in the context of the Vietnam War Prisoner Of War/Missing In Action issue. John Rambo, is extricated from prison by his former superior Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna) for a top-secret operation to bring back POWs still held in Vietnam. Teamed up with a female Vietnamese freedom fighter (Julia Nickson), Rambo embarks on a ""reconnaissance"" mission. A love interest develops in the beautiful young guide -- she dies by enemy fire; he seeks revenge. Of course, there are also corrupt American officials behind the mission, and Rambo saves them for last. Over the course of the film, Rambo kills enough communist bad guys to fill the Rose Bowl, using everything from fishing line to exploding arrowheads to rocket launchers. Rambo II raises the standard of goriness and violence from its initial film. Stallone portrays Rambo as a killing machine who is on a rescue mission.Aside from that,he also tries to assert himself through violence and murder.The brutality was just too much at least during the time of its release.It truly shows that Stallone was on top of his game as a physical actor.Overall,the movie is an action film that provides great entertainment through brutality and violence.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
15,hitchcockthelegend,Not Expendable!,8,26 January 2020,"Rambo: First Blood Part II is directed by George Pan Cosmatos and collectively written by David Morrell, Kevin Jarre (characters), Sylvester Stallone and James Cameron. It stars Stallone, Richard Crenna, Charles Napier, Steven Berkoff, Julia Nickson and Martin Kove. Music is by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Jack Cardiff.The sequel to 1982's First Blood, this finds Vietnam Veteran John Rambo released from prison on proviso he undertakes a special mission back into Vietnam to find proof of American POWs still being illegally held captive there...OK! It's all very implausible and cartoon like, and of course now it's very un-PC, pulsing with stereotypes and indicative of the Reagan era 1980s. It also lacks the character depth of the first film, reducing Rambo, the scarred and bitter war veteran at the iconic core of the franchise, to merely being a robotic killing machine. However, it's an action fan's dream, where even as the flag waving patriotic fervour hangs heavy, it's an explosive pic that thrills and excites from first frame till last. 7.5/10",Rambo - First Blood Part II
16,Theo Robertson,Somewhat Offensive,3,30 July 2003,"The Vietnam war was one of the bloodiest conflicts of the 20th century . It was almost certainly the most needless conflict of the 20th century with America confusing Vietnamese nationalism with Soviet inspired communism . America lost the conflict along with 58,000 of it`s servicemen with another two million human beings killed in the war . What is forgotten at the time is the amount of ill feeling the war created against the USA , but by 1985 much of the bad feeling abated towards Uncle Sam , then some Hollywood executive decided to make RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD PART TWOThis is a film with a rabid right wing agenda . It`s also rather racist with the vague plot of an all American superman parachuting into `Nam where he meets up with a female Vietnamese sidekick except she looks like one of her grandparents was Asian while the other three were white Europeans ! Of course the full blooded Vietnamese are shown as being cruel , stupid and totally untrustworthy . Worst of all they`re shown as being nothing more than stooges for their Soviet masters . Say what you like about the Viet Cong but the Vietnamese people are ultra patriotic nationalists . They have maintained their independance by fighting for it against foreign invaders for centuries and are stooges for no one so it`s both ridiculous and offensive to see the Vietnamese troops being ordered around by the Soviets like flunkies . According to this film the VC can`t even shoot straight ! Not only does this insult the Vietnamese it also insults the Japanese , the French , the Americans and the Chinese who`ve all suffered military defeats this century to the humble Vietnamese peasent farmer",Rambo - First Blood Part II
17,Hey_Sweden,To survive a war...you've got to become war.,7,17 April 2017,"Sly Stallone returns to one of his most iconic roles in this slam-bang sequel to the memorable 1982 thriller ""First Blood"". John J. Rambo is now doing time in a prison work camp due to the damage he caused in the original movie. But his former superior / mentor Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna) comes to him with a proposal. He will earn his freedom if he undertakes a dangerous mission in Southeast Asia. He will return to the Vietnamese jungles to obtain proof that there are still American soldiers being held prisoner there. He's only supposed to take pictures; he isn't supposed to engage the enemy. But that will very much prove to be impossible.The real life frustrations of Vietnam veterans and families of M.I.A. soldiers are right at the forefront in this combination of political statement and gung ho, ""toss all credibility out the window"", comic book style action movie. Directed capably by George P. Cosmatos, with a screenplay credited to Sly and none other than James Cameron, this sequel delivers the goods in a BIG way if one is looking for lots of spectacle and a glorious body count. There's some very potent violence (without much in the way of gore), as well as one explosion after another, to ensure that viewers don't ever get bored. Jerry Goldsmiths' rousing, majestic score is the icing on this escapist cake.Sly does a good job, but he's surrounded by even more praiseworthy co-stars. Crenna is, again, very convincing. Charles Napier is superb as one of those loathsome bureaucratic weasels the audience will dearly love to boo. Steven Berkoff contributes deliciously over the top, one note villainy as Russian creep Podovsky. (Some people consider this a virtual reprise of his performance in ""Octopussy"".) Unfortunately, we're denied the pleasure of seeing the character buy it on screen; he just sort of disappears from the action. Martin Kove of ""The Karate Kid"" fame is fine as a mercenary type. The simply gorgeous Julia Nickson is endearing as a helpful ""indigenous agent"" and potential love interest.The climactic action where Rambo turns into a clichéd ""one man army"" is tons of fun, even if it admittedly takes absurdity to extremes. There are other highlights, though, especially Rambos' response to Podovsky when the Russian orders him around.This is kind of similar to ""Commando"" from the same year, except that ""Rambo: First Blood Part II"" takes itself seriously. ""Commando"" did not.Seven out of 10.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
18,LeonLouisRicci,Pack Your Canon,4,14 April 2013,"""Do we get to win this time?""...says Rambo as he agrees to go into SouthEast Asia to take pictures of POW Camps. So this is going to be a Photojournalist Story uncovering the unpleasant fact that there are still Soldiers left behind. What a different kind of Movie that would have been.No one, not even the Screenwriters expected our brooding Anti-Hero to pack that kind of Canon. Things start with this kind of say one thing and do another that makes for hurt feelings and downright disgust. When Rambo finds out he has been betrayed by the CIA he gets on the horn to them and says...""I'm cumin' for you"". Loud cheers could be heard in Cinemas across the USA.This was a very popular Reagan era Movie that was as brainless as these Action types could be. There is one scene where during his retreat he completely blows up a Civilian Village with Women and Children that he has just passed on his way to the jungle. No one in the audience and those cheering this as great fun seemed to notice.The Action scenes today seem repetitive and lackluster and the whole thing is so much claptrap that it cannot pass even the lowest of expectations. Can be seen only as what passed for cathartic in the never really resolved aftermath for the Veterans who served in Vietnam.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
19,poolandrews,Decent but soulless sequel to First Blood.,6,9 April 2010,"Rambo: First Blood Part II starts as Colonel Sam Trautman (Richard Crenna) finds Vietnam veteran John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) doing hard labour in a state prison, Trautman has a deal for Rambo that could earn him a Presidential pardon. With over 2,500 POW's still missing in action in Vietnam a special mission to locate & free them has been set-up, it would be Rambo's job to go solo in Vietnam & gain intelligence on suspected prison camps still be used to hold American soldiers. Rambo agrees & is flown into Vietnam to gain information but is under strict orders not to engage the enemy, an order which becomes impossible when Rambo realises he & the POW's are nothing more than political pawns who are being used. Rambo becomes very angry & lots of things explode & lots of people die...Directed by George P. Cosmatos I saw the original First Blood (1982) just a couple of days ago & was impressed so decided to check out Rambo: First Blood Part II & while not as good or as well thought out in terms of straight ahead ridiculously macho action you can't go far wrong. The script comes from James Cameron & Stallone himself although Cameron has gone on record stating that he only wrote the first draft saying he wrote the action & Stallone wrote the politics, when Rambo is killing an enemy soldier or blowing something up there's a definite political message here about the Government abandoning American POW's, about how America lost the war, about how war hero's are treated back in the US & about corrupt military officials which is rather heavy handed & far from subtle. Just listen to Rambo's final speech to Trautman at the end for an idea of the overblown Hollywood style sentimentality & ideals this film revels in. Luckily for us there's not much of that political nonsense & far more time is devoted to Rambo in the Vietnamese jungles waging a one man war on the enemy, plenty of people die & plenty of things are blown up in a parade of action set-pieces ranging from fights, shoot-outs, helicopter chases & the destruction of an entire enemy camp by missile. However while the action is plentiful especially during the last half Rambo: First Blood Part II felt a bit soulless to me especially when compared to the first which had such a strong story, here the flimsy plot is nothing more than to hang action set-pieces from & actually have Rambo be a soldier unlike the original. At a brisk 91 minutes in length it's short & to the point, if your looking for pure action then you could do a lot worse than this but if your looking for something with as much substance as the original then you may be disappointed.The bad guy's are purely there to be killed by Rambo, in fact I think it says a lot that the only villain to have any speaking lines in English is Lieutenant Colonel Padovsky played by Steven Berkoff while all the other Soviet & Vietnamese bad guy's speak their own language. The IMDb 'Tivia' section states that Stallone directed most of the film with Coismatos there in name only. The action scenes are great & there's none of this modern shaky hand-held quick editing crap either, you can see the explosions & the shoot-outs just as they are intended although there's too many scenes where Rambo is vastly outnumbered yet doesn't get even hit by a bullet as none of the bad guy's can shoot straight. The bright lush jungles of Vietnam make a nice contrast to the dark rugged terrain seen in the original although I guess you could say a jungle full of tress isn't to dissimilar to a forest full of trees.With a supposed budget of about $44,000,000 this had about four times the budget of the original, although set in Vietnam this was filmed in Guerrero in Mexico. The acting is alright, Stallone is poor here but pulls the one man army thing off with style.Rambo: First Blood Part II is a great mindless Hollywood action film, it's not as thoughtful or deep as the original but as a pure shoot-em' up this is hard to beat. Followed by Rambo III (1988), Rambo (2008) & Rambo V: The Savage Hunt (2011) is currently in production.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
20,utgard14,"""Do we get to win this time?""",8,22 July 2015,"Extremely fun sequel to First Blood takes things in a bit more of a comic bookish direction than the first film but it's undeniably entertaining. John Rambo heads back to Vietnam to find POWs and winds up fighting the Vietnamese, the Russians, and an American bureaucrat (Charles Napier). This is one of the all-time great movie sequels. Many consider it to be even better than the first one. It's certainly a lot of fun but I think the first one can be enjoyed on a more serious level than this, while still being entertaining. This one is just sheer popcorn fun. The script, co-written by James Cameron, is full of memorable lines and scenes, with great characters brought to life by a fine cast. Sylvester Stallone and Richard Crenna return from the first movie; both are excellent. Charles Napier makes for an especially slimy villain. Steven Berkoff, George Cheung, Voyo Goric, and Martin 'Cobra Kai' Kove play stereotypical but colorful baddies. Beautiful Julia Nickson steals every scene she's in as Rambo's bad-ass partner and potential love interest. Good score from Jerry Goldsmith. Solid direction from George P. Cosmatos with cinematography from the legendary Jack Cardiff.This movie put Rambo out there as a cultural icon and, in that way, it does surpass the original. Following this there were Rambo toys, a cartoon series, video games, and comic books. If you were a little boy in the '80s, chances are you were a Rambo fan. Many people don't care for this movie and it goes beyond the usual ""too good for action movies"" film snob crowd. As with the Missing in Action series, a lot is made from certain corners about how these types of movies were offensive to the families of real POWs. I don't agree because I find nothing inherently offensive about fictional stories using real-life events, nor am I quick to find something in everything to be upset about like some are. What is fantasy without wish fulfillment, after all, and how many people back then wished our government had handled the war and the POW situation differently?Anyway, this is an exciting actioner that I think few fans of such movies will find fault with. It's well-crafted and certainly good-looking. The action scenes are wonderful. Yeah there are improbabilities, contrivances, and a high cheese factor. But it's all just so much fun I really don't think you will care much. It's the '80s action movie by which all other '80s action movies are judged.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
21,lastliberal,"Happy Bithday, Charles",7,12 April 2007,"Where is Rambo when we need him. I don't care if Stallone has to travel in a tricked-out wheelchair, he could find Osama bin Laden and all those terrorists. Why isn't he called? Maybe it is because of bureaucrats like our birthday boy, Charles Napier. Playing Marshall Murdock, who sent Rambo in to hopefully find nothing so Congress could shut up those looking for our missing. This is the best part of the movie, when Rambo tells Murdock, ""Murdock... I'm coming to get you!"" And the sequence when he arrives back at the base - priceless.I don't care if this was reportedly one of the very worst movies of 1985. It is a guilty pleasure to go back to again and again. Steven Berkoff, who was also a superb Victor Maitland in Beverly Hills Cop, is a superb Lt. Col. Podovsky in this film. And, Julia Nickson-Soul in her first film? Well, I can only say, terrific! If you want special effects and loud action, then this is the movie for you. If you need a vicarious experience against government bureaucrats, come here! If you want to see the one person who could have saved us from an invasion of Iraq if we had only sent him after Osama, here he is!

22,zardoz-13,Rambo on the Rampage in Southeast Asia!,9,8 August 2010,"This explosive, high-octane sequel to ""First Blood"" (1982) qualifies as a brawny, action-adventure epic that finds our troubled, misunderstood hero pressed back into service to return to Vietnam and search for missing American P.O.W.s still reputed to be in captivity. Originally, director Ted Kotcheff's ""First Blood"" depicted the trials and tribulations that a former Green Beret encounters when he came home from Vietnam and clashes with an obnoxious, hard-headed sheriff. ""First Blood"" was derived from author David Morrell's cult novel. Eventually, after a high body count, John J. Rambo surrenders to the authorities. Whereas ""First Blood"" emerged as largely tragic, ""Rambo: First Blood, Part 2"" is primarily heroic. The film generated some controversy during its release with its contentious subject matter about surviving American P.O.W.s left behind in Vietnam. Surprisingly, ""Rambo: First Blood, Part 2"" did not create the 'free the American P.O.W.s. Ironically, the film that did create this niche genre was Kotcheff's ""Uncommon Value"" that came out two years before ""Rambo: First Blood, Part 2."" Nevertheless, this sequel attracted more attention. Moreover, this sequel is a lot more charismatic because the James Cameron & Sylvester Stallone screenplay deals mostly in black and white with fewer gray areas of subtlety. Remember, this is a formulaic actioneer with titanic archetypal characters competing against each other. This time Rambo is the white-all-over good guy protagonist battling overwhelming odds amid fantastic looking scenery. He wields his trusty knife as well as throwing blades, RPGs, explosive-tipped arrows, and a helicopter. One scene sums up Rambo's ideas about weaponry. He states: ""I thought the mind was the best weapon."" The villains are appropriately treacherous and savage, especially British actor Steven Berkoff as the sadistic Soviet colonel who tortures our hero and George Cheung as the North Vietnamese officer who kills the heroine. As ""Rambo: First Blood, Part 2"" opens, Rambo is shown in prison. At least, he assures his visitor and mentor Colonel Samuel Trautman (Richard Crenna of ""Catlow"") that he knows where he stands behind bars. Colonel Trautman makes him a proposition that will get him out of stir and back into the real world. After Rambo returns to Southeast Asia for the mission, he doesn't like the head honcho, Marshall Murdock (square-jawed Charles Napier of ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls""), because he doesn't trust him. Murdock claims that he served in Vietnam, but Rambo remembers Murdock's outfit being stationed somewhere else than where Murdock said. Before Rambo boards the jet that will take him to his destination, he informs Trautman that he is the only one whom he trusts. Afterwards, things go downhill rapidly. Rambo lugs an arsenal of sophisticated weapons aboard the jet. When he bails out, his parachute cord snags on the fuselage and jeopardizes his life. Consequently, our hero must resort to his razor-sharp knife to slash his way free of the plane. Of course, Rambo sacrifices that valuable, state-of-the-art arsenal, so he can survive and carry out the mission. Remember, he was instructed only to take photographs of the P.O.W.s. Incidentally, a similar plot complication occurred earlier in director Ted Kotcheff's rescue-the-P.O.W.s-from Vietnam movie ""Uncommon Valor"" (1983) with Gene Hackman. The heroes lost their arsenal and had to improvise. At this point, Murdock wants to abort the mission, but Trautman won't let him. Meanwhile, Rambo makes his rendezvous after a little jaunt through the jungle and a brief encounter with a snake hanging from a tree. Rambo meets up with Co Bao (Julia Nickson of ""Glitch!"") and she takes him to a river where pirates working for pay ferry them upriver. Since Rambo has lost his equipment, he cannot carry out his mission of photographing the P.O.W.s. Obstinately, Rambo slips into the camp and cuts loose one P.O.W. hanging from a rack. Our muscular protagonist hauls the P.O.W. off to the extraction point. Initially, Murdock is against flying in to retrieve Rambo, but Trautman puts up enough flak to convince him to go ahead with the flight. What happens next surprises not only Trautman but also Rambo. Murdock aborts the pick-up as Rambo and the P.O.W. stand on a hillside surrounded with Vietnamese soldiers. Predictably, Trautman is furious. The Vietnamese call in the Russians to interrogate Rambo, Lieutenant Colonel Podovsky (Steven Berkoff of ""Octopussy"") who confines our hero to a massive set of bed springs and fries him repeatedly with jolts of electricity. To make this scene and its torture more visually palatable for audiences, Cosmatos uses the venerable prison movie tactic of showing the lights dim with each successive jolt of electricity. Podovsky wants Rambo to confess his crimes, but Rambo has other ideas. Meanwhile, Co Bao infiltrates the prison camp posing as a prostitute. Earlier, before Rambo and Co Bao sneaked into the camp, they saw a prostitute on a motor scooter enter the camp, so she uses this as her cover to get inside the barbed wire and rescue Rambo. Rambo warns Murdock that he is coming after him and escapes with Co Bao. Jerry Goldsmith's orchestral score puts sizzle into the action. ""Exorcist"" sound effects editor Fred J. Brown received an Oscar nomination for Best Sound Effects Editing for ""Rambo: First Blood, Part 2."" Director George P. Cosmatos doesn't waste a second in this trim 94-minute exercise in larger-than-life violence, while ""Conan the Destroyer"" lenser Jack Cardiff captures all the gritty, muddy, visceral action with his widescreen cameras. ""Rambo: First Blood, Part 2"" features many iconic scenes for this type of movie. The helicopter attack on the prisoner-of-war camp is an exciting, adrenalin-laced sequence with multiple cameras covering the action as our hero strafes the camp and blows up guards. Later, Rambo's helicopter squares off with the chief adversary who flies an imposing helicopter. The most incredible scene, however, in ""Rambo: First Blood, Part 2"" is the scene aboard a river ferry where our battle-scarred hero kisses an Asian girl. Rambo never locked lips with anybody in either ""First Blood"" or any of the other ""Rambo"" sequels.",Rambo - First Blood Part II

24,Boba_Fett1138,Rambo goes home.,8,11 April 2008,"Rambo returns to the battlefield, were he feels most at home and is most of use. He gets send on a top-secret operation to bring back POW's still held in Vietnam. Dumb, big, overblown action movies really don't get any better than this! It's therefor shameful that his movie currently has a mere 5.5 rating on here. This movie is a true '80's action classic. Although yes, I admit I have always had a weak spot for Rambo and Rocky movies, perhaps because they are so overblown and quite silly once you start thinking more about it but yet always manage to work out so well.The movie is actually quite in contrast with the previous first Rambo movie; ""First Blood"". In that movie in fact hardly any soul died, while in this movie Rambo is on one big killing spree. Rambo shows his killing spirit again, when he returns to Vietnam, that is often described in this movie as his 'home'. He is one of those persons who lives and should die on the battlefield and isn't much good for much else. This is what also got him in trouble in the first Rambo movie. It's this movie and the other sequels that made Rambo a synonym for action and killing. A true one man army, while the first movie was a much more personal and restrained movie with its main character. You understood the character while now instead you have a tough character simply running and shooting on everything that is moving. It's a sort of shame that they didn't developed the Rambo character any further from the same perspective as in the first movie. But oh well, than we wouldn't had the big overblown Rambo character we know today and Sylvester Stallone is so well known for. The story is this time written by Sylvester Stallone himself and none other than James Cameron, who worked on the screenplay before getting fame as the director/writer of ""The Terminator"". However this doesn't also mean this movie has a good story. In fact if you start over-analyzing it, it's pretty poor all, so lets just simply not do so. This is not an action movie that's a bout its story. if you want an action movie with content you should stick to watching the first Rambo movie.Of course not only the Vietnamese but also the Russians get involved because after all this movie got made during the cold war. A theme that also often returned in several Sylvester Stallone flicks, as if he fought his personal own cold war during that time.It's mostly this movie that shows why Sylvester Stallone is one of the biggest action heroes that ever lived. He is tough, has big muscles, knows how to handle guns and smaller weapons such as his knife and good old bow & arrow. This is however not Sylvester Stallone's finest acting moment tough, while he was still rather good in the first Rambo movie. But I don't really think that this movie its story allowed any of its actors to shine in it. The movie also features Steven Berkoff, who always knows to play the sort of ultimate Russian villain, even though he himself is British. Richard Crenna also reprises his role again from the first movie.The action is nice and big and is what makes this movie such a fine one to watch, especially of course when you're into the genre. The movie is directed who was an action movie specialist, even though his movies were often of questionable quality, except for ""Tombstone"", which was his finest moment, even though its debatable how much of that movie he actually directed. The movie is being uplifted even more by the musical score. It's Jerry Goldsmith's best score for a Rambo movie and a true fine piece of action scoring. Too bad they didn't turned up the music volume some more in this movie.A real likable '80's action flick.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Rambo - First Blood Part II
25,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,He never did take any pictures,6,23 August 2008,"I guess I get it. The first introduced the one-man war-machine, it was fairly believable as well as genuinely good, and the door wasn't closed on it... so a sequel was perhaps inevitable. Never mind the fact that it not just didn't need a follow-up, but almost certainly shouldn't get any. Hollywood overruled sense in favor of profit. Not the only time it's happened, and won't be the last. Heck, bad things don't have to come of that, anyway. It does, here, though. Why did the Russian guy sound considerably more like a German person? What possessed them to put Napier in the role that they did? Has he been that unimpressive of a screen presence since he appeared on TOS? On second thought, don't answer that. The plot isn't terrible. Neither is this flick as a whole, really. It's fine, and can be fun, it's just pretty obvious, and, at times, predictable. The action is cool, relatively exciting and well set up, and has memorable moments to it. There definitely is plenty of it. The acting is reasonable. There is also a message in this. The language is much milder and less frequent than in First Blood. The DVD holds a photo gallery, a trailer and a dozen or so featurettes, usually mere minutes in length, the editing of which, it's not poor, if they end abruptly(and redefine the term ""reused footage""). I recommend this to fans of the people involved in making it, in particular Stallone and Cameron(you can tell that he worked on the script, some), and those who found the battles the best part of the predecessor and/or wanted a movie with a greater amount of such(the guerrilla aspect of this can be kinda awesome). 6/10",Rambo - First Blood Part II
26,view_and_review,The Force of Freedom,6,23 July 2019,"When I was a kid this movie was known simply as Rambo because the first movie was called First Blood. It was after this movie came out that there were the action figures and the cartoon. I remember the catchy hook from the commercials: ""Rambo. The force of freedom."" I think the 80's is when they really started pushing action figures and toys based upon movies and cartoons. There were Transformers, Voltrons, G.I. Joes, and then Rambo got his action figure. I had never seen Rambo the movie though.Watching the movie now I see that I would have been wooed by the action for sure. Gatling guns, machine guns, exploding tip arrows, and of course the Rambo knife. I so wanted a Rambo knife when I was a kid. It was the coolest knife I'd ever seenNow, the action doesn't appeal to me as much. I'm older and it's 80's action which means machine guns, helicopters, and vessels that blow up on impact. Plus, the story itself is a little far-fetched for my taste.While John Rambo is serving his prison sentence he is recruited by Col. Murdock for a mission. With this mission he would have his prison sentence waived. Undoubtedly, he accepted the mission.The mission was to go into Vietnam and take pictures of a P.O.W. camp. If there were POW's there he was not to attempt a rescue, rather he was to take pictures then report and leave the rescue to the army.That makes sense. One man trying to rescue a group of soldiers is a guaranteed failure even if his name is John Rambo. Maybe he can dodge bullets and kill bad guys but certainly his rescuees can't.The plot and the plan was more convoluted and shady than that which required Rambo to go into Rambo mode. In Vietnam. Again.I didn't like the idea of being in Vietnam again, 13 years after the war concluded. The idea that there were P.O.W.'s 13 years later didn't make sense to me. Furthermore, Rambo doing his guerilla warfare type fighting in Vietnam with a lot more enemies to kill wasn't as appealing either. It was like: how can we get Rambo to do more action hero stuff on a bigger scale?Rambo's drive, purpose, and desire was solid. It was probably the most believable aspect of the movie. He told Murdock that he wanted the country to love him and other vets as much as they loved their country. That's commendable and probably the best line of the movie. Everything besides that was action or action related--good for '85, bad for '19",Rambo - First Blood Part II
27,Uriah43,An Army of One,5,13 February 2020,"Having gone totally berserk by shooting up a town in the first film, ""John Rambo"" (Sylvester Stallone) has now been sentenced to hard labor at a maximum security prison. While there he gets an unexpected visit by his former army commander ""Colonel Trautman"" (Richard Crenna) who offers him a pardon if he will agree to accept a dangerous mission into the jungles of Vietnam to ascertain whether there are American prisoners-of-war still being held by that government. He is further instructed that he is to make absolutely no contact with any Vietnamese forces and neither is he allowed to rescue any prisoners that he might find as this is strictly a reconnaissance mission. Concerned more for the welfare of his fellow soldiers than for his own personal safety, Rambo accepts the assignment. What he doesn't know is that the American government doesn't share that same concern and only wants to absolve itself from this issue to further certain corrupt business interests. Unfortunately, it soon becomes apparent that somebody forgot to inform that the officials in charge of this particular prison camp who, instead of evacuating the camp, continue to carry on as if business is normal. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film started off rather well but then proceeded to veer off-track somewhere around the mid-point by throwing realism to the side and endowing Rambo with near super-human abilities. So much so that this film won a Razzie Award for both Worst Picture and Worst Actor.

Now if you go back to these films and see them again, they are both patriotic propaganda, but this one really goes for broke.Nothing really much happens for the first 30 minutes, it's just a bunch of Basil Expositon, it's only when we hit Vietnam that the party really starts.The script is hilarious, Crenna basically spends the majority of the film telling Napier just how bad Rambo can be, Napier sweats a lot, and Stallone flexes, and slaughters almost everything in sight.It almost verges on parody, and I'm sure if you edited scenes from Hot Shot! Part Deux into this film, you wouldn't be able to pinpoint the difference.But no matter how silly the film is, it's just too much fin to dislike. From Hollywood go to bad guy circa 83-85 Stephen Berkoff's crazy Russian pantomime villain, to the wonderfully hilarious blowing up the bad guy with an arrow, this movie proves why Stallone was so big in the eighties.He just wanted to entertain, albeit in the most bizarre manner.Rubbish, but so enjoyable.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
30,Aaron1375,Kind of the start of the wave of over the top violent action 80's movies!,8,7 March 2009,"Yes, this movie was the start up for mainstream, violent, bloody action movies of the 80's. Movies like Robocop, Die Hard, and a host of others. This one though was the most successful at the box office with a whopping 150 million back in 1985. Which makes the low score here a bit surprising. Granted I can see why it would not score as well as the first movie in this series as First Blood is the more realistic of this set of movies. I liked this one more because of the over the top way it was presented, but it seems a lot of people must rate this movie as quite bad for it to be rated in the five's. Oh well, to each his own. This movie has Col. Trautman going to a prison where Rambo is doing hard time, the Col. has a proposal for Rambo. If he agrees to do a certain mission in Vietnam he will be pardoned. Well I think Rambo agrees to it less for the pardon, but more for the opportunity to do the mission which is find intelligence that shows the Vietnamese still are harboring prisoners of war. He goes in and there is a bit of action here and there and then Rambo gets caught, then escapes and goes on a bloody rampage. Granted it is a bit much, I still found this movie very fun and entertaining. Lots of bullets are expended, arrows shot, and missiles too! You know the one guy working in Vietnam is a bit of a butt, so that makes the ending a bit satisfying. So if you are watching this one, do not try to compare it to the first one...it was trying to be a bit realistic, while this one sort of says to the heck with that.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
31,Wuchakk,Comic book action flick about Rambo going back to Vietnam,6,27 April 2020,"The imprisoned Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is offered a mission by Col. Trautman (Richard Crenna) to go back to his old stomping grounds in 'Nam to see if there are any living American POWs. Charles Napier, Martin Kove, Julia Nickson and Steven Berkoff are included in the peripheral cast.""Rambo: First Blood Part II"" (1985) contains what you would want from a Rambo flick: A muscular protagonist, a one-man-army scenario, a noble cause and loads of action, particular of the jungle warfare variety. It also has a quality cast, fabulous locations and a moving score.Unfortunately it's marred by a glaring comic book vibe that spurs chuckles throughout, which is disappointing for fans of the outstanding first film. However, if you can acclimate, ""Rambo II"" can be enjoyed as a serious adventure, albeit thoroughly comic booky. It's entertaining for what it is, but it's my least favorite of the franchise. The next movie (1988) is more-of-the-same, albeit set in Afghanistan.The film runs 1 hour, 36 minutes, and was shot in Mexico (Guerrero, Sierra Madre del Sur de Chiapas & Sierra Madre del Sur de Oaxaca).GRADE: C+/B-",Rambo - First Blood Part II
32,The_Void,Escape From Vietnam,7,25 November 2004,"Sylvester Stallone reprises his role from 'First Blood' in this belated sequel; Rambo 2. This time, everyone's favourite superhero Vietnam veteran is thrust back into the hell that he sees as home; Vietnam itself. The plot is thinly applied, but it sees Rambo taken back in by the United States army in order to find out if the Vietcong are indeed holding US prisoners of war. However, Rambo isn't one for following orders and despite being told 'not to engage the enemy', before we know it; he's punching, shooting, stabbing and bombing his way through Vietcong army. Not to mention anyone, and anything, else that gets in his way. The Rambo franchise succeeds because it isn't bound by the laws of logic. One man defeating hundreds all by himself is preposterous, and I don't care how big his muscles are, but it doesn't matter as this film is meant to be a fun ride and it is; the far fetched action scenes are part of what makes Rambo what it is, so just turn your brain off and enjoy is my advice!The plotting of this sequel is very much like that of John Carpenter's Escape From New York, in that it sees a heroic icon battling his way through a foreign land, liberating people and meeting various friends and foes as he goes. I don't like Sylvester Stallone, but it's undeniable that he's in his element here. Along with Rocky, Rambo is a character that cinema fans have come to associate with Stallone; it's a character he personifies and one that you couldn't ever imagine anyone else playing. Also like Rocky, this series is penned by Stallone. He got some help with this installment, however, from Terminator director James Cameron. The script itself isn't very good; it's silly and spends far too much time building up it's central character. It's also very corny, and the ending in particular is of note in that respect. However, a pompous script is something that comes hand in hand with overblown action movies; and the script, strangely, turns out to be of benefit to the movie as it adds to it's charm.The rural setting of Rambo 2 is very different to the mostly urban locations of 'First Blood', and that creates a nice contrast between the two films. This film lacks the 'substance' of the first film (not that it had much), but on the other hand; it has more action. This one isn't superior to the original, but it's not inferior either; the two are about on par. It's more action here, or action split with a little substance over there; take your pick.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
33,mm-39,Rambo is an Icon,8,19 January 2002,"Sylvester Stallone has one of the most recognizable faces in the world for a reason; this genius has created two pop culture Icons Rocky and Rambo. Anywhere, in the world these two characters will be reconized.  Stallone has many detractors, but his vision, writing, and acting out these characters has made him rich and sucessful in a highly competitive industry.  Before Rambo, his sequel to First Blood, Stallone was just a star like Gene Hackmen, but this movie created a mega star.  As part of gen x I love this film, it is a prototype for many action films that followed.  The story brings out raw emotions, tension, and adrenaline. The viewer relates with John Rambo his pain, and how the government lies.  The action takes the viewer on a incredible ride.  I love the battlecry he gives out when he does a chopper assault on the bad guys, and the explosive arrow that smashes his adversary, along with the machine gunning of the computer system at the base.  The camera angles, expressions, and physical acting is perfectly done.  You leave the picture feeling good, and that is what movie escapism should be.  Stallone, who is ridiculed, along with Arnold for his physical acting, can with this ability create a great stage presence. This emotion he creates with his body is done by, how he walks, flexs his arm etc.  Could Robert De Niro done this film, maybe(ie Cape Fear) Tom Cruise no way, Val Kilmer No. This film is what an  action film should be, I've seen very few lines for an Action movie as long as this one.  PS the speech at the end gave the spirit of what the film was about.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
34,Mr-Fusion,"Borders on the absurd, but does it so well.",7,7 March 2011,"""First Blood Part II"" just might be the purest action movie of the '80s. Not the greatest, but one that doesn't let anything else sidetrack it from the big setpieces. As a sequel, you have to put the original ""First Blood"" out of your mind because they're completely different beasts. PART II lacks the tension and characterization of its predecessor, but almost kinda makes up for that in its promise to show you ripped Stallone killing a bunch of bad guys. He goes on a rampage, be it with a bow-and-arrow, RPG, M60, machete (in convenient knife size), or just facing down snarling bad guy Berkhoff in dueling attack choppers. It's like the Reagan '80s in big Hollywood movie form, with one explosion after another, classic gear-up montage and the gorgeous Julia Nickson as a fringe benefit.The action scenes are ridiculous, the politics are silly, but dammit, sometimes you just need a good 90 minutes of blood, guts and BOOMs after a hard day at the office. 7/10",Rambo - First Blood Part II
35,JamesHitchcock,"Take that, Charlie Cong!",3,6 March 2008,"By rights, there should never have been a ""First Blood Part II"". The original script for ""First Blood"" had John Rambo committing suicide at the end of the film, but this was changed to allow him to live, not because the producers wanted to make a sequel but because test audiences found the original ending too depressing. Nevertheless, someone obviously thought that the character was too good to waste, because he ended up as the hero of two more films in the eighties, plus the recently released fourth instalment.The official title of this film was ""Rambo: First Blood Part II"", but it is more commonly known simply as ""Rambo"". It starts with the title character in jail, where he is presumably expiating the crimes he committed in ""First Blood"", although this is never made too explicit. He is removed from prison by his former commanding officer, Colonel Trautman, for a secret mission. Rambo is to return to Vietnam to investigate reports that American POWs are still being held captive by the Communist regime. He is under strict instructions not to attempt to rescue any prisoners or to engage the enemy; his is to be simply a fact-finding mission.What Rambo does not realise is that he is being set up, not by Trautman, who is portrayed as brave, honourable and incorruptible, but by the organiser of the mission, a military bureaucrat named Murdock. Murdock intends that the mission will prove that there are no American prisoners in Vietnam, partly because that will improve relationships between the American and Vietnamese governments, partly because it will make his own life easier. Unfortunately for Murdock, Rambo discovers that not only are Americans still being held prisoner, they are also being kept in hellish conditions. Of course, he is far too much of a hero to leave them to their fate, and tries to rescue them. The rest of the film is more or less one long battle between Rambo and a few allies (including a beautiful Vietnamese girl) and the evil commie soldiers and their Russian allies. Most of the evil commies, of course, end up dead, although I was surprised to learn from your ""trivia"" section that the total death toll was as low as 67. At times it seemed as though Rambo was trying to wipe out the entire Vietnamese army.The tone of this film is very different from the first. In ""First Blood"" Rambo was unquestionably a criminal, even though his responsibility for his crimes was lessened by severe provocation and by his mental instability. In ""Rambo"" he is a bona fide all-American hero. A few years earlier the director, George Pan Cosmatos, had made ""The Cassandra Crossing"", a biased piece of left-wing anti-American propaganda. Cosmatos, however, was nothing if not versatile, and ""Rambo"" proves that he could also turn his hand to biased right-wing pro-American propaganda. The one thing the two films have in common is that both are laughably bad.""First Blood"" had its faults, but it also had its virtues. Its stance, that the anti-war movement was partly to blame for the problems faced by Vietnam vets in readjusting to civilian life, was a controversial one, but at least the film was trying to make a statement about war, social attitudes to war, and the roots of violence in society. ""Rambo"", by contrast, has very few virtues, except that the action sequences are well enough done to please those who like that sort of thing. It is essentially a sort of jingoistic revenge fantasy for those Americans who were still sore about the Vietnam war. Rambo re-fights the war single-handed, and this time the right side wins. Take that, Charlie Cong! By this point, no doubt, the film's admirers (and there seem to be plenty- more than 2,000 voters have already given it ten stars) will have concluded that I am a liberal commie-loving pinko. Far from it- in fact, I have always despised Communism as a pernicious ideology. What I dislike about the film is not its politics but its lack of subtlety and its suggestion that the solution to all problems, including ideological disputes, is to go in with all guns blazing and to try and kill as many people as possible. It makes no attempt to understand the political complexities of South-East Asia or why not everyone in the region was pro-American. For all its anti-Communism, the film is the sort of moronic sledgehammer propaganda that the Communists were very good at churning out themselves- except that they attributed all the world's problems to Capitalism, or Imperialism, or Revisionism, or whatever other ism they had taken a dislike to. Compared to ""Rambo"", ""The Green Berets"" was a masterly piece of political analysis. 3/10",Rambo - First Blood Part II

Also, Sylvester Stallone plays Rambo, a role that he has immortalized, remarkably, yet again. 'Rambo: First Blood Part II' is set in the context of the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue, it sees Rambo released from prison by Federal order to document the possible existence of POWs in Vietnam, under the belief that he will find nothing, thus enabling the government to sweep the issue under the rug.'First Blood' was a fantastic film, that held your attention very well. Being it's sequel, 'Rambo: First Blood Part II', as told, offers hardcore entertainment & lives up-to the expectations. Though I have seen all the films from the 'Rambo' series, I consider 'First Blood' & 'Rambo: First Blood Part II' to be the best among all. Screenplay by Stallone & James Cameron, is entertaining, fast & brutal. The Action-Sequences are superbly done and are full of blood & gore. George P. Cosmatos's Direction, is passable. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are decent.Performance-Wise: As told, Stallone delivers remarkably as Rambo, a character that he has immortalized ever since. Richard Crenna is sincere.

I just love always how Arnold, Bruce, and Sylvester are big guys but never get shot, and somehow they can kill over 50 men with one gun. It's just classic.""Rambo: First Blood Part II"" takes off in prison where Rambo is paying from his last actions from the first Rambo. Only the general has a new assignment and knows only Rambo could complete it. He just has to take pictures of P.O.W.'s, a.k.a captured Americans, in Vietnam that are being tortured. Of course him being Rambo, he wants to be a hero and save these guys with a hot Asian chick who knows how to use a gun. Together they fight to save these Americans, but fail the first time due to the guys who we thought were good but turned out to be bad and it causes Rambo to get captured, but of course the girl comes to save him and they escape together where we ""discover"" they like each other, which cf course can't be good, you just can guess what happens to the girl to lead Rambo into a rampage on the Vietnamese and Russians.This is just too classic and for fun, come on.

He's supposed to just take pictures of where the POWs are being held, but instead he decides, ""Hey, let's kill all the Viet Cong"" and so starts a bloody rampage that only a stupid person like John Rambo could be involved in - and survive using brawn.This movie puts the ""silly"" back into ""stupid silly action movie from the '80s that defies all logic."" Whereas the original was a rather surprisingly smart survival movie with good acting and low-key directorial style, the sequel by the late George P. Cosmatos (""Cobra"") is all over the place -- loud, trashy, vile and violent. Stallone took steroids to beef up for this role (he said so himself in Muscle & Fitness magazine) and it shows, he's twice the size he was in the original. Apparently the fact that he's so huge impedes the sunlight or something because the Viet Cong can never seem to be able to hit him, even when he's running through an open field and there are fifty guys behind him, all firing -- but when he spins around and fires with a handgun he can take down three, maybe ten at a time without flinching.Oh yes it's the epitome of Stupid Action Movies from the '80s, where the hero can kill everyone, the foreigners are evil, stupid and don't know a weapon from a hole in the ground, and the system is corrupt and ""out ta get me.""

This time around Rambo is back in Vietnam and fighting once again. But instead of the deep character, this time he is more of a silly cartoon/comic book character that is the best of the best at what he does. Although he isn't a deep character and lack the humanistic approach the first movie had, Rambo is still a likable character here and a badass. Although Rambo stood out in the first movie, this film is what made him a icon in the eyes of many viewers. Rambo becomes the iconic action hero character because of this film and I can see why. Yes this is one of those cheesy and dumb movies of the 80's but it's still a entertaining ride all together. This is also the only Rambo movie that has a bit of romance in it as well, although very short. The action set pieces are just really well done and entertaining to watch, if I lived through the 80's and saw this film at that time, I would have been blown away in the theaters. It's still amazing and entertaining to watch, plus it's really fast paced and there really isn't any dull moment. Rambo's signature battle cry is just epic to watch while he uses different types of weapons including a chopper and even exploding arrows in order to get the task done. Like some reviewers are saying, Sylvester Stallone gives a great and entertaining stage presence and the whole movie overall will make you feel excited and good, even after it's finished. The corny one liners is funny to listen to and will be brought back as jokes in the future cause of the entertainment value of it all, which isn't really something negative.

However, Rambo is bent on helping to release them.Stallone as Rambo proves he is a force to be reckoned with, wiping away enemy combatants left and right as he displays his very formidable set of fighting and survival skills. It was satisfying seeing him deal with these merciless and sadistic creeps like sadistic Vietnamese Captain Vinh (Dana Lee) and his Russian comrade, Lieutenant Colonel Padovsky (Steven Berkoff). Berkoff has always played the part of the lead villain in his movies, and his role is this one makes you continue to love to hate his character. In addition to the rescue mission, Rambo must also face corruption from his fellow government officials, which adds onto the suspense in the story, and shows that he is one human being that nobody should mess with. Filmed in a fast pace with plenty of action and tension, it is certainly one of Stallone's most intense performances, in a film that truly depicts some of the horror of the Vietnam War, but also how determined a soldier can get to not leave fellow comrades behind.

42,sddavis63,It Lacks The Depth Of The Original,4,7 May 2014,"Most sequels fail to live up to their predecessor. Rambo: First Blood, Part 2 is no exception to that rule. Of course, it brings back Sylvester Stallone in the title role, but in a very different story in which Rambo is a very different character. In the first movie, Rambo was a complex character with depth, battling inner demons that slowly came out, and Stallone did a good job of portraying the character. But with the inner demons revealed, Rambo is less interesting. We know him; we know the past that made him. So, without much to learn about Rambo the sequel becomes a pretty standard action movie. Lots of action, bit not a lot of depth.The story revolves around Rambo being recruited out of prison to lead a reconnaissance mission looking for American POWs still being held in Vietnam. Of course, at the head of the mission is a corrupt bureaucrat who has a very different agenda. Richard Crenna returns as Col. Trautman.The action is well done, although a few points bugged me. Julia Nickson played a Vietnamese woman (another special ops type) who's very capable, but the attempt to introduce a bit of a romance between her and Rambo came very much out of the blue, although it was mercifully cut short. Of course, I laughed when the Russians were introduced into the story. It was a movie made in the 80's after all. Even if it's set in Vietnam it has to have the Russians as the bad guys.Certainly this isn't anywhere near as good as the original. (4/10)",Rambo - First Blood Part II

Told by his good friend and former CO or company commander in ""Nam"" Col. Samuel Trautman, Richard Crenna, that all he has to do in get inside The People's Republic of Vietnam, which Vietnam was called since the Commies took over in 1975, and come back with evidence that the Commies are holding US POWS there that will prove the Vietnamese are in violation of the Articles of the 1929 Geneva War accords.Ready and more then willing to go into action Rambo feels a little queasy in that the US Government official who's in charge of the operation Marshall Murdock, Charles Napler, want's him only to shoot pictures of,if he finds any, US POWS and the prison camp that their in and not shoot any hated Vietnamese troopers or prison camp guards. What Rambo as well as his friend Lt.Col Trautman are soon to find out is that Murdouck and those that he answers to in D.C want his mission to fail with him ending up dead! That in order to placate those pesky people back in the states clamoring for an investigation of the some 2,500 missing POWS whom the grateful, for their services, US Government left behind and presumes to be dead!The best of the Rambo/First Blood movies has Sly Stallone as ""Rambo the Destroyer"" destroys a full battalion or was it regiment of Communist Vietnam troops together with scores of their Soviet military advisers. While doing his duty for his country, killing Commies, Rambo manages to put some romance into his violent filled life by striking up a relationship with his Vietnamese contact on the ground the beautiful Eurasian Co, Julia Nickson, who earlier saved Rambo from being tortured to death by his Soviet and Communist Vietnamese captors. It's Co who ends up losing her life when the Commies, Vietnamese and Soviet, cornered her together with her love Rambo before they could make their getaway across the river to the US military base in Thailand. Now on is own, the way he always liked it, Rambo starts to take the enemy apart with an unending supply of explosive tipped arrows, Rambo is part Native American, guns and ammunition that seems to come from out of nowhere as well as a fully armed and equipped Soviet attack helicopter that he grabbed from the fleeing Commie troops. It's during this slug-fest that Rambo came upon the prison camp where the US POWS were held prisoner and at the same time was doubled-cosed by Murdouk, who was just following orders from his superiors back in Washington D.C, who left him and the prisoners , by not flying them out by helicopter gun ships, high and dry to twist in the wind!***SPOILERS*** Rambo now fit to be tied not only takes on and destroys whatever is still left of the battered Vietnamese & Soviet troops but is determined to get back home, to Thailand, and pay back Murdock for all the trouble that he caused him with interest compounded! Not all that believable but still very watchable movie that you have to realize was made when the Cold War was still active and there was very little sympathy here in the USA for those Vietnamese and Soviet Commie soldiers whom Rambo knocked off.

This is nothing more than wretched and ludicrous comic strip of action and thrills, which lacks detail and meaning. So, don't be expecting something thought provoking or an important moral to the story. The plot is extremely flawed, lacks logic and incredibly ridiculous. While, the script (not a great deal of one) is basically corn, filled with macho dialogue and it's quite mundane. So don't read too much into the mess of the plot and dialogue, though at times it did try to tug on the emotional strings, especially at the end. With it usually coming across as cheesy. But saying that, it shouldn't destroy the mood of this film. It's pure popcorn fun and nothing more! There are plenty of one-man verses entire army heroics thrown into in some energy packed scenes.

The film as a whole is rather tedious and slow at times, but the action set pieces are actually quite good and you can say creative to a certain agrees.

45,Robert_duder,The transition to ultimate action flick is flawless and this is one of the all time greats...,9,26 January 2008,"Some will say that nothing will top the original Rambo and I couldn't disagree more because I was under the impression that Rambo had always been an action series but the first film (see my review) had far more of a dramatic curve to it and less action. Then they came back with First Blood Part 2 and completely changed the face of this series, and of action films in general. The eighties was the ultimate decade for no holds barred, blowing things up, guns blazing, bad guys dying, gratuitous violence and F-Words, and action heroes and First Blood 2 might have been the start of all of that because it is the true Action Genre fan's dream film. The body count is astronomical and these aren't innocents in the wrong place like the first time...these are bad Vietcong and Russian war mongers holding prisoners so Stallone's Rambo can rip through them. After seeing First Blood I think the immediate question on anyones mind is...""When do I get to see Rambo become this killing machine that we get a glimpse of?"" and the film makers and Stallone (who wrote this installment) said 'RIGHT NOW!' and they deliver and make us understand completely Rambo's brutal machine-like soldier personality and experiences.Sylvester Stallone returns in full form as John Rambo and doesn't forget all the work he put into establishing this character in the original film. He's still quiet, angry, brooding, and finding his way in a U.S. Prison after being locked up after the events of the first film. But now he's got a mission that he can't turn away from. Stallone is the ultimate killing machine and yet the film still has the back bone of a story. Again (like First Blood) the final scene and dialog between Stallone and Crenna is really quite moving. Stallone is right on track and at the top of his game. Richard Crenna returns as Stallone's only friend and the only one he trusts. Crenna never gets very involved in the story or gives a lot of arc to his character but he's the balance to Rambo's character and he is decent for that and a staple to the series. Charles Napier takes over from Brian Dennehy as the hard ass military man who becomes more of a nemesis to Rambo than an ally. He is great in his role and the final showdown with him and Rambo is classic. Julia Nickson-Soul is also very good as Rambo's love interest and quasi-partner who saves his skin a couple of times. They don't get a lot of time to establish their romance and yet they still somehow make it believable.Obviously First Blood 2 isn't some Oscar worthy masterpiece. But from an action genre perspective it's truly mind blowing. I mean the action is non-stop with spectacular fight scenes, and nail biting escapes including an unbelievable Helicopter chase that leaves you on the edge of your seat. But then you also have an actual story underneath it all about these POW's tortured for years and you have the continued emotional and physical battle Rambo plays with himself over the war and how he's treated by his country. It's not a perfect movie. I think the Rambo series is one of the worst for stereotyping races...the picture perfect Vietnamese accents in English, and same with the Russians. Crenna is rather dull in the film as he was in the first one. But focus on the action and the sequences and the story and if you love action films this is one that will absolutely blow your mind. This is the second time I've seen it and it's going right into my keep pile because this is one movie I'll be watching again and again.

46,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Rambo back in action again.,6,19 September 2019,"'Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985)' does lose the essence of the first film, becoming much more of a brazen 'action flick' that indulges in the very violence its predecessor seemed to decry. However, it also makes a point of showing that perhaps its hero is more at home in war than, well, at home, which combines with some elements of military mistrust (or, at least, a mistrust of military officials, who here try to cheat the soldier for their own gain) to create a thematic tapestry not too dissimilar to what was achieved in its predecessor. It's undeniably less effective, though. The picture is also by far the most forgettable of the series, despite introducing some of its most iconic imagery - including a shirtless Rambo firing explosive arrows from a bow - and having a couple of character elements that carry on through the rest of the franchise. 6/10",Rambo - First Blood Part II
47,ThomasDrufke,"""I'm Coming For You Murdock""",6,15 September 2019,"I feel like you always have to be a little weary going into an 80's action movie, or really, you just have to understand a lot of times that they rarely took themselves seriously and almost always over the top. I'm not a fan of the first Rambo film, as I felt it did the opposite of what I mentioned up top, but admittedly part 2 is infinitely more enjoyable as a laid back action film from the decade that defined the genre. It's predictable and cheesy, but that's what most would expect out of an 80's action adventure. It lacks nuance and originality, but most will likely be okay with your basic run of the mill Stallone film.6.0/10",Rambo - First Blood Part II

I seen so many bad political comments here, it just make me think, ""Do people see movies to judge the political points of the film."" That annoys me a lot. I think people should just sit back, relax, and enjoy a great action film.This is basically about Rambo leaving prison to go to Vietnam and defeat the bad guys.I looked at the awards for the film and I was surprised to see how many Razzie awards this movie won. This movie is so much better than that. Stallone deserves better.The action was great, there is more action than the first film. The rousing score by Goldsmith is better than the first film.Overall, I liked this Rambo movie a lot. I can't wait to see the next two. I rate this movie 8/10.",Rambo - First Blood Part II

Sylvester Stallone is trying his best to bring the same amount of drama to this movie as he did the first one, but this isn't a drama. It's an action movie. It's an amusing, predictable, typical 80s action movie that takes itself a little too seriously.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
50,CuriosityKilledShawn,Dumbo: More Blood Part II,6,14 April 2006,"First Blood was a fable written in the days of old by none other than William Shakespeare. It was a tale of a simple man overcoming adversary and finding peace within himself.Well, maybe I'm lying. The simple man was true though. How simple must a man be to use the logic, ""If it moves, I kill it."" Last time we saw John Rambo he was hauled off to prison for laying waste to a redneck town. And in prison he remains. For the first five minutes, anyway.Colonel Trautman shows up to offer Rambo an Escape From New York-style ultimatum. If he goes back to 'Nam and takes photos of American P.O.W.s, he'll receive a full pardon for his crimes against the hillbillies.""Do we get to win this time?"", he asks.""This time, it's up to you!"" Trautman says, which basically gives him licence to massacre as many baddies as possible. And massacre he does.The first movie had a body count of one. Just a single death in the whole film. And it was accidental, caused by the character's own stupidity. Whatever reality First Blood had is well and truly gone now.The biggest strength of this sequel is its rousing score by Jerry Goldsmith. The original theme is expanded and exploited, with brilliant new ones kicking in at moments of high action. It's exciting stuff and you can only imagine how poor the film would be without it.George Pan Cosmatos was widely regarded as a hack. There is nothing here to prove otherwise, but his direction is adequate, rather than exceptional. The scene where Rambo emerges from a pile of mud is one of the few moments of directorial spark. By today's standards, it's pretty simple stuff, but back in '85, when the actor Ronald Reagan was still in The White House and the Cold War took it's last few breathes, it became a massive hit.It's no secret that America lost in Vietnam. And 10 years on the country still felt cheated by the government. It needed a way to get back at them and show who the boss REALLY is. So Rambo returns to kick ass.Originally written by James Cameron as a script called First Blood II: The Mission, the film was never going to be anything other than pure fantasy. And it is here that the one-man-against-the-world sub-genre started. The villains are cardboard. Steven Berkoff plays the role of a stereotypical Ruskie bad guy with no grace, or charm. His character serves no purpose other than for Rambo to kill him last. No huts, or shacks, exist for any other reason than for Rambo to blow them up. No Viet Cong shows his face and lives.It's this touch-and-go attitude that prevents the film from becoming truly engaging, or worthy. The standard three act structure is apparent and you can tell that the producers just wanted to churn out a money maker rather than anything serious.Ted Kotcheff made First Blood about an emotionally scarred man, who wanted no more than what he deserved. Shakespeare it was not, but it was a good movie, even if it didn't set the box office on fire - just everything else. Now George Pan Cosmatos takes the same character and turns him into a disturbed schizophrenic mass murderer. No human emotion, just mindless violence. Although there is room for Rambo's big speech at the end, it's not as clever, nor as moving, as is it was first time around. It sounds so very ""American"" and disgustingly patriotic.Still the movie takes millions and Rambo has become an historical icon. Everything about the Reagan era is is this movie. It's superficial, narrow-minded and VERY un-PC. But hey...it was the Eighties.",Rambo - First Blood Part II

52,851222,10/10 when i was ten years old. At 28 it doesn't look that cool anymore,10,1 September 2014,"Greetings from Lithuania.Recently i had an opportunity to re-watch one if not the most watched film of my childhood ""Rambo: First Blood Part II"" - ye, there were no limitations to watch these R rated flicks back then (not that there are many limitations to do it now). I re watched it on 2m x 2m screen, with sound system and all that stuff, and you know, it's not that cool anymore. I know it sounds kinda stupid. This picture was one of my favorite (probably the favorite) when i was 10- 12 years old. Whats not to like! A absolutely calm, cool, muscular Sylvester Stallone at his very best (not as good as Rocky although) in a superb shoot em up flick, with some macho one liners, revenge, simple love and lots, tons of action action action - it's was a blast so say the least.At 28 years, i can safely say, ""Rambo: First Blood Part II"" aged already a lot. There are action flicks, that you can still safely watch 20 - 30 years after they release, like Speed, Die Hard, Predator - they are timeless. ""Rambo: First Blood Part II"" sadly isn't one of them. It was cool to simply remember the old scenes, words, moves and etc. but sadly it's look and most important feels very old, it's absolutely unrealistic, which kinda threw the suspense and all coolines down - the reason why ""Speed"" still works as hell is that it's absolutely realistic and suspenseful with great acting all the way long, and Rambo II is not acted very well, it's a macho 80's kinda stuff slick, that sadly does not clicks like it use to be.Overall, because you have all probably have seen this click, i will give it 10/10, just because of the memories, it forever will be one of those flicks ""that i used to watch when i was a kid"".",Rambo - First Blood Part II
53,The-Sarkologist,One long bullet fest,4,29 September 2017,"This is one of those films that was quite popular back in the 80s, but seems to have fallen by the wayside of late. Then again I suspect this it has become somewhat dated and certainly didn't attain the cult like status that some movies did. In a way, like the previous film, the main purpose of Rambo was to try and come to terms with the failures of Vietnam, and dress it up in some form of action film where the all American action hero storms in and saves the day (though it is interesting that we do learn about Rambo's heritage here).The film begins with Rambo in prison however he is approached by his former commander who offers him a way out – return to Vietnam and attempt to rescue some forgotten prisoners of war. However, things pretty quickly go pair-shaped when it becomes clear that the person pulling the strings actually has a different agenda in mind, and once again Rambo simply discovers himself a tool of some faceless, and heartless, Washington bureaucrats.Where as the first movie focused mainly on those who had returned, this movie brings out the concept of those who were left behind. Apparently an agreement was made in 1972 where the American government would pay war reparations in return for the release of their prisoners of war, and not surprisingly the Americans reneged on this agreement, and the prisoners were left to rot. However, this had the potential to explode into a public relations disaster sooner or later (and sort of went against the idea of leave no man behind). Well, this is where Rambo and his mission comes in – not to rescue the prisoners but actually prove that there aren't any there.Mind you, such a movie wouldn't have worked with simply having the Vietnamese as the enemies, so they upped the ante by bringing in the Russians. However, the one thing where this film does end up falling down is the fact that it pretty much degenerates into one massive slug fest. This is probably why I wasn't as impressed with this film as the previous one. In a way it really seemed to fall into some angry rant against the Vietnamese for not only torturing their prisoners, but not letting them go (needless to mention the fact that the Americans were trying to sweep this under the table as well).In a way this film seemed to be capitalising on the renewed interest in the Vietnam War, but really did little to address the issues. Ironically, one of the characters looked a lot like a skinny version of Churck Norris, who also made a couple of Missing in Action films which were actually of a somewhat higher calibre. Sure, this film does have its intrigue, and its untrustworthy bureaucrats, but it does really finish off all that well. In a sense it just seems to reach a point where the screen writers really couldn't work out where to take the film and simply gave Sly a gun (and a helicopter) and had him pretty much run around blowing everything up. Talking about the chopper, that last scene, where he is destroying the camp, is equally ridiculous in that he basically managed to blow up an entire POW camp without injuring a single American (as well as flying a damaged Chopper all the way across Laos only to have it fall apart when it landed at the base in Thailand).",Rambo - First Blood Part II

55,slightlymad22,"Nothing Like First Blood, But I Love It Anyway",8,7 January 2016,"Continuing my plan to watch every Sly Stallone movie in order, I come to Rambo: First Blood Part 2.Plot In A Paragraph: Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna) pulls some strings to get Rambo (Stallone) released from prison and reinstated into Special Forces, to go on a covert mission back to Vietnam, in search of proof they are still holding American POW's. This movie is nothing like its predecessor, which I rated a 10/10, it's so far removed from it, they should have dropped the 'First Blood Part 2' part of the title and simply called it 'Rambo'. First Blood was a tight thriller with some bits of action here and there, with politics (about how America treated its soldiers returning from Vietnam) in there too. This movie is an over the top, patriotic red, white and blue flag waving action movie that has Rambo killing 74 people (as opposed to 1 in 'First Blood') as the one man army once again goes on the rampage. And I love it. When I was younger this was my favourite Rambo movie, and I still have a massive soft spot for it. Stallone has never looked better than he does here, he is in the best shape we have seen him so far. He is once again backed up by the brilliant Richard Crenna (How did this man not get more work?) Julia Nickson is absolutely gorgeous (and is the reason I developed a bit of a fetish for oriental women) and does a great job. Charles Napier is perfectly cast as Murdoch (who gets of lightly in my opinion) unlike an under used Martin Kove who takes the brunt (Or end of a machine gun) of Rambo's anger. Whilst the one man army does take some believing, most are killed one of one, with Rambo sneaking about the jungle (like First Blood) slowly disposing of them. It's not a thinking movie, but it is an enjoyable one.Once again Stallone made changes and extensively rewrote the script. This time, one wrote by James Cameron (Terminator, T2, Aliens) who claims hardly anything of his screenplay was left in the final movie. Stallone had done this on every movie since 'Rocky' if he didn't write the movie, he made changes to the script to suit him.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
56,sol-,Vietnam War Parable Part II,6,19 March 2016,"Sent back to Vietnam on a reconnaissance mission under explicit instructions to just observe and report, John Rambo finds himself compelled to intervene after finding mistreated US prisoners of war in this violent sequel to 'First Blood'. The dynamics are vastly different this time with Rambo initiating dozens of kills. The antagonists are also less complex, as opposed to in the first film where Rambo has to protect himself from the prejudiced policemen of his own country. That said, the film carries forward the original's resentment over the reception of Vietnam War veterans very well. Rambo describes himself as expendable, but the POWs are even more expendable, and there is much to ponder when it is revealed that his mission is a box-ticking exercise for the government in order that they can say that they are looking for missing soldiers. In short, this is a more intelligent film than one might expect, if a heavily flawed one. The carnage is even more extreme this time round with whole human beings exploding (!) and Rambo's ability to escape everything unscathed is even more unlikely this time round. There is also an awkward romance and the Communist villains are downright campy, especially Steven Berkoff's Russian officer assisting the North Vietnamese. The film has more virtues than vices overall though; the film's Oscar nomination for Sound Effects Editing is particularly well deserved with all those electrocution noises and excellent background ambiance. Charles Napier is also perfectly slimy as the closest the film has to an American antagonist.",Rambo - First Blood Part II

59,zkonedog,"Rambo Isn't About Mindless Action, Explosions, & Weapons",2,10 March 2017,"When the first ""Rambo"" film (First Blood) came out, it became an instant classic due to its gritty and political take on the negative treatment of Vietnam War vets (or the whole Vietnam War in general). Unfortunately, this sequel turns the franchise into a shoot-em-up, blow-em-up, over- blown action farce filled with shallow plots, tired clichés, and groan-inducing one-liners.For a basic plot summary, in this movie John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is temporarily recruited back to the service with Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna) to help rescue Vietnam prisoners of war. However, when the mission goes awry, Rambo must once again turn into a ""killing machine"" in order to salvage the objectives and get the men out alive.This film should have been focused on the next chapter of Rambo's life, but it instead eschews any character growth in favor of mindless action, endless explosions, and shiny new weapons. The franchise is much the worse for this transformation, as it takes the human/political aspect of the character and throws them right out the window. The little bit of character growth that director George Cosmatos does try to nurture feels completely out of place in this smorgasbord of explosions.In terms of acting, Stallone is never really given a chance to emote like he did towards the end of First Blood. Instead, he is reduced to shouting, grunting, and growling while patrolling automatic weapons. Also, Crenna and co-star Charles Napier are quite one-dimensional and thus very difficult to form emotional connections with.Thus, I consider ""First Blood Part II"" to easily be the worst of the Rambo installments due to the shift from a political focus to one of pure action and little plot substance. At times, this film is so hokey that it is almost difficult to watch. You can skip it entirely and not lose out of any of the Rambo character experience.",Rambo - First Blood Part II

In fact, the entire movie is basically a 97-minute cheese moment, it never stops!Also, I just noticed on the IMDb that First Blood Part 2 (probably the most awkward name for a sequel until the much-anticipated Jason X Part 2 comes out at some yet to be determined date) is that it was nominated for an Oscar for Best Sound Effects Editing, but was also nominated at the Razzie Awards for Worst Supporting Actress, Worst New Star (this was definitely a deserved win, by the way), and Worst Director, and WON for Worst Screenplay, Worst Original Song, Worst Actor (also in Rocky IV, which is a distantly better movie!), and Worst Picture. Don't miss this one!Rambo has now been in a prison camp for 5 years breaking rocks and such, when suddenly a military man approaches and tells him that the United States has a certain sensitive situation in Vietnam that could earn Rambo his freedom, were he to help them to solve it. It seems that there are still missing POWs in Vietnam and they need Rambo to get in there and take pictures of where they're being held so they can send in a tactical search and rescue team. Rambo, of course, is trained in search and rescue himself (and also he's freaking Rambo) so he can't bring himself to simply take pictures and then leave the Americans in captivity, so he takes the mission of the rescue entirely upon himself.He is helped along the way by the astonishingly beautiful Co Bao, a Vietnamese freedom fighter. This woman is unbelievably beautiful, but sadly she does nothing but stop the already unimpressive movie in its tracks as we're asked to believe this girl is a militant freedom fighter. And the fact that Julia Nickson-Soul (the much deserved winner of that Worst New Star award) is absolutely incapable of covering up the fact that she is a native English speaker didn't help matters either. The accent on that woman in this movie is hilarious!There are some corrupt American officials and policies involved in the mission as well, all providing a sufficient set-up for Rambo to trample through the movie distributing Rambo- style justice to wherever it may be needed. I have to say the first movie wasn't even very good, but the descent that Part 2 has made is genuinely surprising. Definitely the worst of the not-very-impressive series, but it's still tons of fun.

Although running much along the same lines as that Norris pic, Missing In Action, that coinsided with this, of course Rambo coming off better in the ticket office, here's one treasured Sly flick, shot in vibrant color with great photography, and thrilling action and stunts, plus an intense torture scene with Sly. We almost feel too close to danger in this spectacular and very colorfully shot Rambo, that today still leaves a mark. We almost taste that sweat. Sly having his vengeful moment at the end, letting off shell after shell, was really impactful, and the ending song, Peace In Our Life, was great.

Raygun was in office and American was deep into it's patriotic phase (a phase that would start again following Iraq War, Part One and after 9/11). After the events that have transpired in First Blood, we find Rambo breaking rocks (I am not making this up) inside a Federal Prison somewhere in Mexico (the entire movie was filmed there). Col. Trautman offers him a deal with Black Ops. He can either sweat to his heart's content for the rest of his life getting even bigger by breaking rocks or he can go to Mexico, I mean Vietnam and settle some old scores, I mean take a couple of snaps.Whilst Rambo chooses the easier of the two options, the filmmakers give him ample camera time to show off his new ripped body he earned breaking rocks in the Federal Pen. But like all of these movies nothing ever goes like the way they're supposed to. Check out Rambo as he grunts and moans his way into American pop culture. Despite all of the cheesy flag waving and macho dialog, Rambo II is a fun popcorn movie. Especially when Charles Napier passes the torch to Sly Stallone.

69,bsmith5552,",,,,,Run Through the Jungle",6,8 September 2006,"""Rambo: First Blood Part II"" is the second film in Sylvestor Stallone's Rambo trilogy. If you ignore the inconsistencies, it's a pretty good action film. In fact, the action sequences as directed by George Cosmatos are as good or better than you'll see in any action film.The story begins with Col. Trautman (Richard Crenna) springing John Rambo (Stallone) from the prison he was sent to as a result of his adventures in ""First Blood"" (1982). Rambo is promised a pardon if he will undertake a special mission in Viet Nam. In Thailand at the base camp he meets CIA operative Murdock (Charles Napier) who is in charge of the mission.Rambo is assigned the task of being parachuted into Viet Nam to photograph a suspected prison camp supposedly housing American Viet Nam veterans missing in action (MIA). What Rambo and Trautman are not told is that the CIA thinks the camp is empty and wants to dissuade the government from searching for more MIAs.In Viet Nam Rambo is joined by his ground contact who turns out to be the the comely young Co Bao (Julia Nickson). They proceed to the camp and guess what...the prison is not empty but full of MIAs. Rambo manages to free a prisoner and he, Co Bao and the prisoner run through the jungle to the pre-arranged pick-up point. When Murdock realizes that Rambo HAS found missing MIAs in the camp, he aborts the mission amid Trautman's protests and strands Rambo and party.Rambo is captured and tortured by the brutal Russian Colonel Podovsky (Steven Berkoff) but Co Bao escapes. Co Bao aids Rambo's escape and the two and the freed prisoners run through the jungle. Rambo commandeers a helicopter loads the MIAs aboard and............Stallone again plays Rambo as a man of few words (at least until his final soapbox speech). He does show vulnerability for the first time as he becomes to attracted to Co Bao. The film does stretch credibility to the limit as Rambo single handedly wipes out half of the Viet Namese army, but he does get to strut his stuff sans shirt through most of the film.Napier makes a good slimy CIA type, Berkoff a fearsome torturer and Crenna has more to do this time as Trautman. The great action sequences save the film.Followed by Rambo III (1988).",Rambo - First Blood Part II
70,freemantle_uk,A Right-Wing Wet-Dream,5,27 May 2009,"After the success of First Blood and Sylvester Stallone growing star after the that film and the Rocky series, a sequel seemed like a logical move for a studio to make money. And it did, with it's box-office of around $300 Million worldwide and latter video and DVD sells, and creation of Rambo fanboys.At the end of First Blood John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) was arrested for his private war in Washington State. Rambo was in prison, working in a quarry when his old Colonel (Richard Crenna) gives him offer. He could do a solo mission in Vietnam to see if his old POW camp still exists and had American prisoners. If he did it then a Presidential Pardon was likely. In Vietnam he discovers that American POWs were still in the camp and taking the mission on face-value tries to go to his extraction where the man running the mission, Marshal Murdock (Charles Napier), aborts it. Rambo now has enemies on two fronts, the Vietnamese and their Soviet backs, and his own superiors back in Thailand.After the Vietnam War some Americans have refused to accept the fact that they lost. It not hard to find people on the internet who believe that American could have won, and were winning on the battlefield. Rambo 2 gives this audience and America a charge to fight and win in Vietnam all over again. The first Rambo film at least had something to say about the treatment about of veterans, which the left and right could agree one. However, Rambo 2 turns Rambo into a right-wing character, showing how great America is, whilst the evil that Vietnam and Soviet Union represent. It also had the other major aspect of the Right-wing American mentality, don't trust the government. This is represented by Murdock, a Congressial bureaucrat who is willing to abandon Rambo and the POWs because of the cost and diplomatic problems that would arise. There are people in America who distrust bureaucrats and politicians from Washington D.C. who are at war with their own government; it's seems nuts to me. As well it shows that Soviet Union is the masterminds to all the evil in the Communist world. Stallone also got to take on the Soviets in Rocky IV in the same year. So we have established that the film is politically dodgy. It's also hard to believe because if the Americans did find out that the Vietnamese still have POWs, wouldn't they do everything in their power to give them back? Either diplomatically, militarily or covertly?The action is pantomime and clichéd at times. There are some good bits, especially when Rambo had to use his old skills, like covering himself in mud before killing a Soviet soldier. This film is the first where we see the famous Rambo like, the hair-band, the vest, boots and the knife, which was parodied in Family Guy and countless people around the world who know of the films. There are some lovely violence deaths; my famous is the death of a Vietnamese soldier using an explosive bow and arrow. There is a Soviet soldier in the film who is shown to be an enforcer for the head of the Soviet troops. He was shown as a sadistic torturer, but could main Rambo for strenght and skill. This is should have been an area the film could have played up.The acting is mixed, just like Stallone performance. Some of his performance is poor, but need the end he shows some of his acting muscles. The best actions in the film are Richard Crenna and Charles Napier as the different sides of the American military, especially in one scene where they argue the rights and wrongs of the situation. The worst performance was by Julia Nickson who played a Vietnamese woman working for the Americans. She couldn't act and the love story between her and Rambo was ridiculous and clichéd.It's okay, but not really worth watching.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
71,Fluke_Skywalker,Not the film you may think it is,6,24 May 2018,"Plot; Imprisoned Special Forces vet John J. Rambo is offered a mission to gather evidence of American POW's still being held in Vietnam, but not everyone wants him to succeed. In 1985, Stallone's two most iconic characters each returned to the big screen. In both instances, critics claimed that the franchises had strayed far away from their roots. Rocky Balboa had gone from a simple underdog plying the only trade he had in a methodically crafted drama to a more erudite fighting machine in a slick, fast-paced story--more montage than movie--that is at once a revenge tale and a Cold War parable. It's immensely entertaining, and a tad more clever regarding the latter than I think it's given credit for, but its connection to the original Rocky is tenuous at best. Rambo II is similarly seen as departure from the original, and in some ways that's certainly true. Like Rocky IV, Rambo II is far slicker than the original. But the idea that it's a ""jingoistic"" flag-waver isn't exactly true IMO. The original First Blood wasn't by any means the first film to tackle the aftermath of the Vietnam War and its returning veterans, but it may be its most effective. Married w/raw, white knuckle action, it puts a laser-like focus on PTSD and the struggle of those who returned home w/o the tickertape parades. Though it's been parodied over the years, Stallone's emotional collapse at the end of that film is some of the most powerful and brutally honest acting I've ever seen.Rambo II sees the character recruited for a mission that's ultimately a scam, leaving him for dead to save the butt's of the bureaucrats. At the end, when asked what he wants, he says that he (and his fellow vets) only want to be loved by their country as much as they love it. This isn't Rah! Rah! USA! USA! stuff. Sure, the Russians show up and Rambo blasts, slices and dices his way through them, but this is far, far less black and white than Rocky IV. Is it any good? Yeah. Well, maybe not ""good"", but is it entertaining? Yeah. Yeah it is. It's a taught, 90 minute actioner than probably has less than 20 lines of dialog in its final half hour, but that's to its advantage. Helmed by red-meat director George P. Cosmatos, it's a technically more proficient actioner than many of its contemporaries. Stallone's Rambo character lacks that raw, exposed nerve edge he had in First Blood, becoming more of the monosyllabic killing machine we think of these days, but as always he remains a compelling on-screen presence. Richard Crenna returns as Rambo's former C.O. in a thankless role that sees him only pop up to occasionally remind us how big Rambo's wang is. Charles Napier and Martin Kove do yeoman's work as the de facto villains.Rambo II is a solid 80s actioner, but it's mostly noteworthy because it's not the Right Wing flag waver it's purported to be. As a Right Wing flag waver myself, I know 'em when I see 'em. That would be Stallone's other film from 1985, Rocky IV.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
72,jimbo-53-186511,Compared to its predecessor this feels rather generic and ordinary,5,31 December 2019,"After John Rambo's escapades in the first film land him in jail, his superior officer Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna) offers Rambo a deal; finish his prison sentence 5 years early and get a full Presidential pardon in exchange for assisting in the rescue of some POW's in Vietnam. With the help of a female Vietnamese fighter, Rambo must try to rescue the POW's without the government's help when he disobeys a direct order resulting in the government's refusal to effect a rescue mission...Topping the first film was always going to be a tall order, but I had hoped that the sequel would at least come close to being as good, but the truth is that it isn't I'm afraid...Whilst the plot is perhaps more expansive in the sequel there isn't an awful lot going on here of much interest; it's plotting is very standard for an action film; Russian bad guys, corrupt government officials etc. For some reason, the writers (one of them being Stallone himself) decided that it was a good idea for Rambo to have a sidekick. Why exactly? He didn't need one in the first film so why did he need one now? I can only assume that as this was made in 1985 this was around the time when all action films needed a sidekick so Stallone and co decided to get in on the act. Whilst the inclusion of a sidekick doesn't necessary take away from the film it also doesn't add anything either and seemed a rather pointless addition.Some of the characters/actors also let the film down somewhat; Steven Berkoff's Russian accent is deplorable and he's too cartoonish to be taken seriously. He's also only featured in around 2 scenes as well meaning he wasn't used particularly well (truth be told that was fine with me). Napier fares slightly better, but again his character is something of a cliché and a little too obvious. Kove was a good presence in the Karate Kid films so it was disappointing to see him only feature in a small role in this film as I suspect he could have brought more to the film with a larger role.First Blood Part 2 isn't a bad film and has enough bursts of energy to make it watchable, but the story isn't great (which is disappointing considering James Cameron had a role in developing the screenplay). Add a poor villain such as Berkoff and an unnecessary sidekick and I was left with a film that got the job done, but not one I particularly cared all that much for.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
73,sauravjoshi85,A Nice movie,7,10 January 2019,I have seen lots of negative reviews for this movie but I liked the movie although not to be compared with first part.

74,barnabyrudge,Mindless mayhem that found considerable favour at the time of its release.,3,27 May 2007,"While the original First Blood had its far-fetched moments, it was at least exciting in parts. In Rambo: First Blood, Part II the emphasis is shifted very much onto comic-book action. Plausibility is totally rejected; logic nose-dives; Stallone becomes so impregnable that there can be no doubt he will succeed in his mission. Just like any other wish-fulfilment actioner of that time (e.g. Invasion USA, Commando, Red Scorpion), Rambo: First Blood, Part II cancels out its own opportunities for real excitement by presenting a hero too invulnerable to fear for. If you can tell from the word go that Rambo is going to wipe out hundreds of enemy soldiers, what is left to get excited about?Imprisoned after the events of the first movie, John J Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is offered a pardon if he will join a covert operation in the Far East. The year is 1985, and a mission is being arranged to find out if there are any American PoWs still trapped in the jungles of Vietnam. Rambo is encouraged to take the job by his old mentor Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna), but the assignment is actually the brainchild of a government outfit fronted by Marshall Murdock (Charles Napier). Rambo's job is merely to head for a prison camp in the jungle and check out if it contains any American PoWs  if it doesn't, he is to rendezvous with a chopper; if it does, he is to get photographic evidence of their existence so that they can be rescued at a later date. Aiding him in his quest is a lady soldier with local knowledge, the beautiful and resourceful Co Bao (Julia Nickson). Sure enough, Rambo discovers that there are PoWs in the camp, but he exceeds his orders by rescuing one of them when he reaches the rendezvous point, the rescue chopper abandons him on the orders of Murdock who, it seems, doesn't really want to find any PoWs because of the political and military implications. Rambo is captured by the enemy and tortured, but following an explosive escape he sets out to free the PoWs and get his revenge on the treacherous Murdock.The few good points of the film come from Jack Cardiff's polished photography, Jerry Goldsmith's exhilarating score, and the sheer professionalism of the stunt team in performing various action antics. Beyond these scant pickings, the film is a failure. The actors are reduced to macho posturing, the plot rings false, the action sequences are soulless and suspenseless, the dialogue is absurd even the violence becomes numbingly predictable. At the time of its release America was under the presidency of Ronald Reagan, a man with simplistic and near-hysterical anti-communist sentiments. For this reason, contemporary audiences lapped up this Commie-bashing shooting-fest as if it was the greatest movie of all-time, transforming it into an undeserved box office success. Thankfully times have changed  nowadays we can look upon it as a simple-minded action flick with a ludicrously high body count, ludicrously dumb politics, and a ludicrous hero.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
75,juneebuggy,"""You're the only one I trust.""",9,4 January 2016,"Say what you will this is still a pretty great movie, not sure why the critics hate it so much. I hadn't seen it in years and had an excellent time watching it again, just a classic. John J Rambo is such a fantastic character; silent, abused, angry and tortured. The movie is filled with extreme action sequences and the body count is high but its kinda awesome. It's also a much bigger movie than 'First Blood' in every way; bigger budget, bigger stakes, bigger body count, bigger hair and muscles.I will admit that at first it did feel a little on the cheesy side, as most of those 80's action movies do now, filled with big bright explosions, bodies being thrown through the air, our hero in tight fitting jeans but its stood up pretty well considering.Part ll finds John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) doing hard time in jail when his former boss, Col. Troutman (Richard Crenna), shows up and offers him a deal. The US government needs someone to travel to Vietnam and try to find American prisoners of war, if Rambo agrees his criminal record will be expunged. Rambo takes the assignment but his anger reaches explosive levels when it turns out that the whole mission is just PR, he's not actually supposed to find any prisoners. Fueled by fury, he rounds up the POWs and the action reaches explosive levels as he then takes on both the Russian and Vietnamese armies.There were several things I loved about this movie; the use of the crossbow, that Rambo was shirtless for half of it (Sly looks amazing). I loved that he got to be in love for a whole 2 minutes ""You not expendable Rambo"". There are also some great helicopter stunts, the torture scene is pretty cool, a good bad guy with the Russian and although Rambo never says much when he does look out, this is filled with some great one-liners. And that ending I loved that he just walks off ... ""How will you live?"" ""Day by day."" 12/15/15",Rambo - First Blood Part II

Then his former superior Colonel Samuel Trautman (The late Richard Crenna) offers Rambo an special mission in Vietnam. Which Rambo could get out of prison early, if he accepts the mission. Once he does along with Trautman, he brought to a military US base to meet Murdock (Charles Napier). Murdock is a man, who works for US Gouverment. Rambo's mission is take pictures of those, who are capture by the enemies and the camps ground. Rambo isn't working alone, since his guide is a tough Vietnamese Freedom Fighter Co Bao (Julia Nickson-Soul). Who knows that way of these enemies camps. After the mission is done, he brings a prisoner of war with him. But Rambo and Trautman find themselves double crossed by the US Gouverment. Rambo finds himself capture by the enemy, which the Vietnamese and the Russians are working together. Now Rambo escapes from the camp with the help of Co Bao. When his contact dies after rescuing him, Rambo plans his revenge on the enemy and Murdock for betraying him on the mission.Directed by the late George P. Cosmatos (Cobra, Of Unknown Origin, Tombstone) made an cartoonish, comic book action film with plenty of explosions and humour. Some critics and audiences at the time, this film was release. They took it seriously and they find it extremely offensive. Especially those were in Vietnam and families, who are suffering after loosing someone in Vietnam. Especially those who are still ""Missing in Action"". This was certainly controversial, when Stallone toked the blame for writing the politics of this entertaining but senseless action movie. While Three-Time Oscar Winner:James Cameron (Aliens, True Lies, Titanic) was responsible only for writing the creative action sequences in the movie.The DVD review is from the Ultimate Edition of ""Rambo:First Blood Part 2"". DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an fine Digitally Remastered-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD also includes the original commentary track by the director. Which at times, he could be informative at times but he's mostly quiet in the commentary. DVD includes the ""Groundbreaking Military Special Operations Features"" opinion, which is fun for the die-hard Rambo fans. This sequel is certainly fun to watch and it's never boring.

80,dworldeater,"""To survive war, you must become war"".",8,23 April 2020,"First Blood is easily one of the best movies to come out in the early 80's and Stallone's performance made him an instant icon of action movies. A sequel was inevitable and while I consider Rambo First Blood pt 2 as way lesser of a film, it's actually a lot different and a pretty good follow up. Sly Stallone put a lot of effort into this film from the writing, the training and the grueling physical performance he gave in the film cannot be understated. He is jacked, ripped and very believable as war machine John Rambo. The film might be a bit cheesy and cartoonish in comparison to the more realistic First Blood. But this was the mid 80's we are talking about here and along with Arnie's Commando this was a game changer for action. Visually, Rambo First Blood pt2 is amazing, with top notch cinematography, great locations and lots and lots of action, which still looks amazing and set new standards for the genre. The score by Jerry Goldsmith sounds great too.

Everything that was right about the first film is shat upon, in what can only be described as a warning against ego. Stallone was obviously upset by his conflicted and complex character in the original, so here Rambo has become a heroic God. No excuses were made for his actions in the first, but now every action is justified. With the help of James Cameron, we now have some clear villains. The American government, some seedy Vietnamese savages, and those crafty Russians. Each of these nationalities is personified by easy to spot caricatures. No subtlety, no debate, just unadulterated propaganda bullshit. With lines as painful as ""You are not expendable"", and ""We want our country to love us, as we love it."" This is a painful exercise in hilarity. The action is there, but every kill is a glorified moment that is used to make us cheer. There was a cruel darkness to the original, but here we see Rambo not atoning for his sins, but justifying his actions with bullets and bloodshed. If only the original had kept the ending where Rambo committed suicide, we wouldn't have to suffer such incompetent and misguided writing.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
84,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A fun sequel although very over the top,7,21 March 2020,"When Sylvester Stallone first entered the scene as John Rambo, viewers may not have been expecting such an explosive turn out in the character he played. Aside from Rocky Balboa, Stallone didn't have many tent pole characters he could create a franchise off of. By 1985, Stallone was already up to Rocky IV (1985), and there was only First Blood (1982). Thankfully Stallone's first outing as Rambo secured him enough to start another line up of films. And while the first film was able to make a clear point about life as a war veteran and the hardships that came with it, Stallone had way more control over the story in this sequel. This is also because Rambo was not supposed to live after the first film.After the events of First Blood (1982), Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna) picks up John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) again for a new assignment. Wanting to determine whether there are any surviving POWs left in a Vietnamese camp, Rambo is assigned by Major Marshall Murdock (Charles Napier) to spy and take photographs (only) if any POWs exist. But things don't go as planned when Rambo discovers POWs do exist with the help of an inside informant named Co (Julia Nickson), who's also looking to flee the country. The screenplay says it was written by Stallone and James Cameron believe it or not. Although, much of what Cameron drafted originally was later changed by Stallone. The usual tropes Stallone includes in his scripts can sort of be picked out here too.Instead of further exploring John Rambo's tortured psyche, Stallone's approach for this entry was looking more at people in his situation and the political drama that happens behind the scenes. The only individuals Rambo trusts are Co & Trautman. Unfortunately, Co's history with Rambo isn't so clear, the plot is basically a reverse of the Rambo's. He came home from war in First Blood (1982). Now he's returning to war in the sequel. Much of the story works because of the social commentary on whose really in control of international affairs, such as adding Steven Berkoff to the cast as Colonel Podovsky. But the other side characters like Co, or Ericson (Martin Kove) don't add a whole lot because of how little development they receive. The fates of their characters are quite obvious.For how those characters are handled, it could also be in part to how the director worked with Stallone. Then again, George P. Cosmatos would also later go on to direct Cobra (1986), Leviathan (1989) and Tombstone (1993), arguably his best work to most. What Cosmatos was certainly capable of directing were the action set pieces. Throughout this film, again mainly due to Stallone's rewrites, the action is cranked up far higher than it was in the last film. There's a ton more explosions, gunfire, stabbings and arrows being shot. If there's one thing that was missed from the first film it was the survival aspects Rambo used for himself while all alone. If anything, that should have been used more, even though there were some aspects of it shown like the utilization of natural backgrounds for camouflage.The cinematography also changed hands for this sequel. Replacing Andrew Laszlo from the initial film is Jack Cardiff, another cameraman from the classic era of filmmaking. Unlike the first movie where Laszlo was filming areas of the western hemisphere, Cardiff was to make the film feel much more eastern. Making sure that the scenery looked as foreign as possible to the domestic viewer. Cardiff also filmed on Stephen King's Cat's Eye (1985). Lastly for music, Jerry Goldsmith returns to score the film and he too amps up his work. Originally, his first score to First Blood (1982) did not highlight the motif of John Rambo as much. That's a one eighty turn for this entry; where Goldsmith makes sure Rambo's theme is played in as many places as possible and it sounds great.Part II is a decent sequel to the original even though it drops the whole PTSD angle for more carnage and political commentary. However, it's still great entertainment as it pits the main character at unbelievable odds as much as the outcome seems highly improbable. The cinematography and music only further make it that much fun.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
85,justin-fencsak,This was the peak of the franchise during a year when Rocky became huge,8,11 January 2019,"When First Blood first came out in the fall of 1982, it became a surprise hit at the box office and made Stallone an action star and began a hit franchise that peaked with First Blood Part II which had legs at the box office and became the second most popular movie of 1985 worldwide. Made for only $25 million and grossing more than 10x its budget , this film spawned two sequels, none of which could capture the magic of this hit film. Even though its rated R, it feels more like a hard pg-13 and was aimed at teens whose parents hated the Vietnam War and looking for something new to root for. This film was a favorite of Ronald Reagan and his pals, and it's easy to see why. Although it's the shortest of the series, it's chock full of action and drama and never lets go until the credits roll.

For a lot of people this one marks the first time they were completely overwhelmed in a theatre. It's such a perfectly crafted and well-written action movie that you immediately wonder whether or not you can just watch Sylvester Stallone kill people for the rest of your life. Then, sooner or later, you somehow develop other ambitions, but this is still one of the most rewatchable movies ever made. George P. Cosmatos' direction is creative, energetic and has a natural flow to it that prevents the movie from just being one set piece after another. It is essentially just Rambo running through woods and villages while getting shot at, but the makers are more than inventive enough to keep that idea interesting throughout. If there's one thing that didn't bother me as a kid, but bothered me now, it's the cardboard villains. The commies are just cartoonishly evil here for no reason, and somehow that gets even worse in ""Rambo III"". Don't forget Stallone also made ""Rocky IV"" in 1985, how much Soviet hate you can cram in your movies before you think it might get a wee bit one-dimensional?

All the staff did an amazing job. Rambo is still very enjoyable and fresh despite its old production year. Just see it and you will say that it is even better than those newer disappointed films. 9/10",Rambo - First Blood Part II
91,MR_Heraclius,Rambo,8,13 February 2020,"What makes this one of the finest action films to come out of the 1980's, a decade that offered a plethora of choices, is that it knows what it is. That was the best part of action movies in the 80's, they were big and dumb, and they knew it.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
92,Analog_Devotee,A wonderful sequel.,7,6 July 2021,"Rambo II + Commando was a very common double-feature at a particular old friend of mine's house back in the day. This sequel embraces the pulp, and I can't fault it for that. Trying to match the drama of the original would have probably proved foolish. Don't let that fool you into thinking there's no depth here -- that couldn't be further from the truth. It's just a different type of movie.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
93,oneguyrambling,Mindless violence gets no better.,7,17 February 2012,"John Rambo is back to inspire a generation of impressionable young boys to smear mud on their faces and hide under bushes before emerging to kill imaginary foes.The next two films in the series differ only in the location and the garb of those that John Rambo will be slaughtering in huge numbers.In Rambo 2 he is lured back to Vietnam to look for POWs that are rumoured to still be detained even though the war is long since past – why they would continue to feed them isn't satisfactorily explained but it justifies the bang bang that ensues.Rambo is the strong and silent type, for the first half hour he says about a word a minute – mimes are more chatty.With this lack of self-promotion Colonel Trautman once again makes an appearance to remind the cheap seats that the quiet guy is actually a dangerous killing machine.Rambo 2 sees Stallone outfit his hero with the now familiar headband, singlet and rock star hair combo, and the film also gives him a love interest in his guide, perhaps the whitest Asian woman on the continent. She and Rambo share a conversation that could pass as tender, all the more remarkable considering that English is obviously not the first language for either of them.Rambo doesn't make his first kill in the film until the 32nd minute mark. He was hardly chatty before that point but from then on he let's his actions do the talking, except for the occasional grunt or 'yeearggghhh'.Once the killing starts it doesn't let up until the credits roll, I tried to count for a while but the fast cutting and sheer weight of corpses made it difficult, leading to questions like:  ""Was that guy flying through the air freshly dead or was he still moving from the last explosion?""  ""How many guys fell over when Rambo strafed that group and how many dived for cover?""  ""Um how many victims should I assume were in that exploding building?"" In the end I gave up, but I am confident the head count topped 60 or 70 easily. For some reason the filmmakers decided that dramatically lowering the population of Vietnam wasn't sufficient and introduced some Russian soldiers to add some unnecessary spice and to increase the accent count, but it's what is on the inside that counts isn't it? And Rambo proves that if you cross him you'll end up a lovely spray of red.U.S.A! U.S.A! (Repeat until stupid. That should be enough.) Will he find the prisoners? Will he engage the enemy? Will he kill an awful lot of them singlehandedly? Well if you read this many words and didn't already guess the answers congratulations for learning to read, but you've got a lot of work to do.Final Rating – 7 / 10. Mindless violence doesn't get much better.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
94,baumer,"Dragon Fly. Wolf Den..colorful names.....You may scream, there is no shame.",10,9 July 1999,"First Blood and Rambo are completely different movies. They have same two characters bu that is where the similarity ends. First Blood was a tightly wound excellent action picture directed very well by Ted Kotcheff. Rambo is an action extravaganza that is not to high on the psychological element the way the first one was. They are both excellent films but I find them entertaining for different reasons. One of the reasons that I find Rambo so damn entertaining is because I enjoy that Rambo is now larger than life. He is the ultimate fighting machine who's only desire is to win a war that someone else lost, and if winning means he has to die then he'll die, no fear, no regrets. That is what makes Rambo the ultimate fighting machine and the ultimate movie character.I love this movie. I love how far fetched it is. I love that Rambo can withstand hours of torture and then have enough energy to escape into the jungle and take on the whole Vietnemese and Russian army. That is what makes this movie so damned entertaining. When I was 14, this was my favourite movie, and it took a great many films and years before it was dethroned. I think I can enjoy and appreciate movies like Apocalypse Now and JFK better than when I was 14, but my love for Rambo and films of its kind will never diminish. This movie is amazing from start to finish.Rambo's mission in this film is to go back to Vietnam and see if he can find a certain camp that may be harbouring POW's. But if he finds these men, he can only take pictures. He has a problem with that and when he does find one he is left behind by the ""stinkin bureaucrat"" named Murdoch who orders the mission aborted before Trautman can pick him up. It is while Rambo is captured that the movie becomes tight, tense and incredibly entertaining. Rambo is also fun to watch on a physical level. Stallone was in the best shape of his life in 1985 as he simultaneously made Rambo and Rocky IV. He is huge, ripped and strong as hell in this movie and it is his psychical presence that adds to his persona. He single handedly goes through a whole army and lives to go get the bastards that left him behind. Rambo is one of the old school feel good summer type movies.Rambo does not claim to be JFK or Mississippi Burning in the sense that it wants you to leave the theater with a message. It has its own beliefs that is for certain, but what Rambo does just like Raiders does is, it entertains. It has you rooting and cheering for Rambo and dissing and swearing at the bad guys for 90 minutes. It is so much fun that I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes to be entertained. Leave your politics for some other movie, that is not what Rambo is about. It is about being entertained and wearing your emotions on your sleeve. That is what is beautiful about this movie. It doesn't apologize for being a bit over the top. Neither should you, for enjoying the film. It is a true wonder. A great piece of entertainment.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
95,NijazBaBs,less emotional than previous sequel,9,26 January 2020,"This sequel is almost not emotional. That is only reason why it does not deserve rating like 1st sequel. But action and end is good. Everything that it needs like helicopter, making traps, revenge, lies, support, friends, explanation. But too harsh and fast yes, but considering this is very old movie, it deserves good rating. Better than most today's which even forget to put vehicles in the movie, especially war vehicles. Realistic. Reminds me about various real life wars that happened before and after this movie was released like bosnian war.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
96,mentalcritic,Jingoism gone rampant,1,5 May 2005,"The ghost of the Vietnam war has haunted the American psyche for thirty years now. If not because of the fact that tens of thousands of American soldiers went MIA in Vietnam, or the manner in which those who returned were treated, then because it was the first war that America could be said to have lost. Many men came home from the war a shadow of their former selves, and the original First Blood managed to provide a small insight into their problems as they attempted to rotate back into the world, as the saying goes. First Blood Part II, on the other hand, is little more than a fist-pumping mess that goes to illustrate how sore America can be, both in victory and defeat. Stallone puts in another sluggish performance as the titular Special Forces commando, while Richard Crenna attempts to hold up the serious actor quotient. Where it all comes undone is in the script, which didn't do any better when it was called Missing In Action and starred Chuck Norris. What little semblance of logic there was in the original is now gone, as the filmmakers decide to paint a big S on Rambo's massive chest.The film picks up a little while after the end of First Blood. The film, that is - the novel didn't allow for the possibility of sequels. In this mediocre follow-up, Rambo has been put to work at what appears to be some sort of open-air mine. As he is breaking rocks and working up a sweat, a prison guard pulls him away to go and have a chat with Colonel Trautman, who advises him that his government is willing to offer him an early release if he goes on a covert mission. Rambo, never one to back down from a hard day's violent work, accepts, and is promptly shipped off to a covert base in what appears to be Cambodia or Thailand (I forget which). From there, he is commissioned to seek out a camp where American MIAs are supposedly being held, and photograph them. His mission quite clearly specifies that he is not to make any attempt to secure their release. Rambo being Rambo, however, has other ideas in spite of their possible political implications.Of course, things go somewhat awry when it turns out that the people commissioning Rambo's work have more interest in making sure no American MIAs are found. It is the age-old conspiracy theory, and makes no apologies for exploiting the plight of many an American family that was left without a son during the ten years that the official Vietnam war had been raging for. Of course, with the Jingoism that was inherent in American society during the 1980s, they could not help but work in a plot tangent about the Vietnamese army being in bed with what appears to be a single battalion of Russians. Together, the two antagonists attempt to extract what information they can from Rambo, but it backfires upon them in an orgy of bullets, arrows, rockets, and destruction. About the only thing missing is the moment when Rambo drinks from a grail-like chalice and declares himself invincible.To be honest, First Blood Part II is a well-photographed, and well-choreographed, action spectacle. The hand-to-hand combat with the larger Russian commander is one of the few battles in the film that has any dramatic tension whatsoever. The rest is simply a case of the lead actor and the director building a fantasy for Americans to pump their fist to. Fortunately, this fad of America über alles action films soon died down when more introspective and intelligent war films such as Platoon began doing the rounds. Some of the kills shown here are quite creative, despite all the problems. The Vietnamese commander meets an end that many an action film villain would envy. The Russian commander bites it in a manner that is as spectacular as it is ridiculous. Only in a 1980s action film would one see a LAW being used from inside a helicopter. Sure, there have been action film clichés rooted in contradictions of fact, but never this ridiculous before.I gave Rambo: First Blood Part II a one out of ten. It is so bad it is ridiculous, and so ridiculous that it is often funny. One doesn't even need to have served in the military to know how stupid some of the action sequences are. The only risk it takes is in trying to make a stupid political statement with what is a heartbreaking subject for those directly involved. Keep the tongue firmly in the cheek, and it might be watchable.",Rambo - First Blood Part II

But of course he's just a pawn in some government scheme.Outstanding action sequences make this Rambo sequel fly high. There's not much of a story here and what there is is pretty predictable but the film more than makes up for that with plenty of spectacular action scenes. Production values are also top notch along with some truly wonderful scenery and good cinematography. A lot of effort went into this one and it shows.The script by Stallone and James Cameron is somewhat pedestrian but has it's fair share of good dialogue I thought. It's a tad too patriotic in the end but who's better at delivering tacky patriotic lines than Rambo himself.Stallone doesn't add any more dimensions to Rambo's character but he sure looks good in the action scenes (and incredibly fit). Crenna is good and Steven Berkoff looks convincing in his villainous role (he should since he never plays anything else).Rambo: First Blood Part II is a rather cartoonish sequel to the first rate original entry but there's no denying that it's very entertaining.,Rambo - First Blood Part II
98,fmarkland32,Winning a lost cause...,7,2 August 2006,"Sylvester Stallone returns as John Rambo a Vietnam vet who is sprung from prison to rescue American POWs who are still in Vietnam, at first the mission is to just take pictures but Rambo of course declares war and then the government officials who lost the war for the US (This was the 80's) the first time around conspire to sabotage Rambo again. Rambo:First Blood Part II is a prime example of the guilty pleasure 80's action flick. It is made with flair and imagination but ultimately is so laughably absurd that it works only for those who want a fix of action. Of course I have always been a fan of the 80's action movies which had a certain verve which always got you to enjoy the action despite it's propaganda where as today movies like this aren't made because for some reason they have to be politically correct. (I also prefer 80's horror over today's horror) still Rambo First Blood Part II represents a phenomenon that gave everyone a hero, even if the hero was clearly a psychopath in the first, still while Rambo:First Blood Part II is merely one of the genre's icons, one must understand that the whole appeal lies in the guilty pleasure. Mainly that now that it is dated the politics as well as the strongman heroics take on a surreal quality which make this even more fun now than it was back in the 80's. Still it's a movie that demands to be seen, especially if you like the genre and want the real deal.* * * out of 4-(Good)",Rambo - First Blood Part II
99,ivo-cobra8,Quintessential pure bad-ass the best action film my number 1 personal favorite,10,1 January 2018,"Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985) is the finest pure bad-ass the best action film of the 80's of all time for me. My number 1 personal favorite film in the action genre I think it is one of the best action movies of all time. I love this film to death and it is my childhood film. Sylvester Stallone returns as John Rambo, the former Green Beret who is given the opportunity for a Presidential pardon if he accepts a mission to confirm the existence of American POW's captured during the Vietnam War. Rambo: First Blood Part II influenced many of action films. Commando come out the same year and it was very competitive with Rambo but this movie won because it was more box office successful. I love this film to death It is the sequel to First Blood (1982), and the second installment in the Rambo film series In my opinion it is Stallone's best film.""Sir, do we get to win this time? ""Awesome and very great intense underrated sequel . it Is a very joy great action movie . Action adventure fun with some substance. Different than the first one , but great as an archetypical good versus bad movie. Very decent, good movie, very entertaining, fast paced wonderful action Hard-R fight scenes and some nice one-liners war movie. There's no shaky cam or CGI here but real explosions. Bad-ass action film I absolutely love it to death! James Cameron and Sylvester Stallone wrote the script that is why this movie was such a bad-ass action. Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Aliens proves to be one of the best action movies from James Cameron he wrote and directed them, that is why Rambo: First Blood Part II was such a success. Brilliantly directed by George P. Cosmatos who later directed Cobra (with Sylvester Stallone again) Leviathan (with Richard Crenna again) and Tombstone. Of course, this wouldn't be an action movie without some action. There's plenty of it, and it's perfectly done. Great action, a slick pace and a barrage of great moments (a random soldier being shot by an exploding arrow being my personal favorite) may not make this high art, but it does create a fun time at the movies, which is what movies are meant to do. It also helps that it has a great score, which sets the tone very well. You have ton's of explosions real practical effects. You see a lot of heavy weapons and they are used well. Rambo uses a knife and kills the bad guys, well, he's Rambo and his knife completes him. Rambo uses Hoyt Archery compound bow which has been well know as the ""Torque Bow"" because of the high explosive arrow tips. I have never seen in any action movie a bow and explosives arrows. Rambo uses a flying helicopter kills all the bad guys blows whole base and saves POW's captured prisoners. In this movie you have Russians and Vietcongs as the bad guys. Rambo blows up an enemy boat by pulling an RPG-7 anti-tank grenade launcher blows them to hell. Great explosion I have ever seen. Rambo blows up Podovsky's Hind helicopter with another grenade launcher M72 LAW.Excellent solid cast Sylvester Stallone does great excellent performance as legendary John Rambo Vietnam vet. I love the character to death. Richard Crenna R.I.P. as Col. Samuel Trautman was excellent I really miss him. Charles Napier R.I.P. as Marshall Murdock was fantastic bad guy. The acting is fantastic from Richard Crenna and Charles Napier the politics were important, such as a right-wing stance coming from Trautman and his nemesis, Murdock, contrasted by Rambo's obvious neutrality. Great music score from Jerry Goldsmith R.I.P.10/10 Bad-ass action film I absolutely love it to death, it is my number 1 action film ! Puts most of action movies to shame. Today they aren't action movies like are this one. Today they are just lousy CGI bullsh** crap.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
100,gab-14712,Disappointing Sequel!,7,5 June 2020,"Eh.....can we just skip Rambo: First Blood Part II and keep watching First Blood on repeat? Okay, maybe this action-packed sequel is not the most awful movie out there, but the 1985 flick is definitely subpar when compared to the first film. The first film was an excellent character study about a Vietnam veteran prone to violence. This film, while exploring some interesting ideas, turns into the run-of-the-mill action flick. The ""returning to Vietnam"" plot has been done to death by this point, so I did lose interest. Funny enough, this film was a major hit. Major enough to keep the story of John Rambo going into current day.The screenplay was written by Sylvester Stallone...and James Cameron. Yup, you read that right. The James Cameron that introduced himself with a bang in 1984's The Terminator. This was an eclectic pairing, and it definitely shows. Cameron has seen better days with screenwriting. According to Stallone, his draft included a sidekick for Rambo and inserted more politics. Stallone had to give the screenplay a more neutral stance given who the character of John Rambo is. Regardless, the screenplay is pretty mediocre.After John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) instigated a guerrilla war in First Blood and was sent to prison, his former commander, Trautman (Richard Crenna) releases him for a new mission. His new mission takes him back to the jungles of Vietnam, where he swore he would never lay a foot there again. His mission is to find where captured American POW's are being held. Of course, Rambo is double-crossed. Now he has to figure out how to leave the Vietnamese jungles alive before he is taken by his own country or the Soviets.Sylvester Stallone is not the best actor out there, but he is good at creating memorable characters. He did that with Rocky and he did that with First Blood. He made John Rambo an interesting character study suffering from PTSD. But here he sheds that personality to take on a role more in line with a normal action hero...and that was pretty disappointing. He did have some good lines of dialogue-especially towards the end, but I was pretty disappointed with his performance, which was only made more wooden from the script. Richard Crenna continued to be solid as Trautman as his role was magnified this film. Charles Napier played Murdock, the big boss of the mission. He also did solid given the material he was given.I did not hate First Blood: Part II. I was just disappointed that the film was turned into a violent, standard action film. I was likewise disappointed with Jerry Goldsmith's score. His ""Rambo"" theme was nonexistent and focused more on electronic music. The end credit's song, sung by Frank Stallone, was meh. Despite everything, the action is still done well. Some of the action is brutal and well-choreographed. Maybe this is a good rainy-day action film, but it ain't no First Blood.My Grade: C",Rambo - First Blood Part II
101,fernandoschiavi,"This sequel multiplies the beating, the deaths, the explosions and the unlikelihood in general and, in this case, transforms its protagonist into an invincible killing machine",6,12 September 2020,"Sylvester Stallone, who had already conquered the world by playing Rocky Balboa a few years earlier, also managed to make ""Programmed to Kill"" another huge box office success and consolidated the actor's career once and for all. Three years after the original film, John Rambo won his second adventure, even though the original is not exactly the film that leaves doors open for a continuation, and to have the hero coming back to spread the violence he so denied in the original. This typical Hollywood sequel multiplies the beating, the deaths, the explosions and the unlikelihood in general and, in this case, transforms its protagonist into an invincible killing machine very different from the more human version of ""Rambo - Programmed to Kill"".John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is serving time in a federal prison when he receives a proposal: if he participates in a suicide mission (which consists of locating American prisoners) in Southeast Asia, he will be pardoned and reinstated to the army. He agrees, but he did not imagine that he would be betrayed by his compatriots, who really do not want any proof of prisoners, as this would entail spending of 2 billion dollars to free them. With that, Rambo ends up being abandoned by the Americans in enemy territory.This time directed by George P. Cosmatos, with a story by Kevin Jarre and screenplay by Sylvester Stallone and James Cameron (who at the time was enjoying the success of ""The Terminator""), the film brings a completely different tone to the first, which practically it leaves the existential and traumatic issues of the title character and focuses almost entirely on unbridled action. Capitalizing on Cold War exactly as in Rocky IV, of the same year, James Cameron's script, which was greatly altered by Stallone himself, as he considered the start of the action itself to take time, puts Rambo back in Vietnam, this time to rescue potential prisoners of war. The subject itself, more than the aforementioned Cold War, was still very hot in the US, with diplomacy and the US Congress debating the alleged existence of Americans still in the hands of the Vietnamese even after so long after the 1973 ceasefire, which was certainly one of the success factors of the sequence.There is a great deal of indigence in the script, reducing the character's complexity and turning it into a one-dimensional killing machine. There is a clear xenophobia in the text, with non-Americans being treated as sadists, savages and inferiors. Besides, the idea of prisoners of war being held for up to 10 years after the end of the fight with no major purpose behind it makes no sense. In a nutshell, the script is just an excuse to show Stallone destroying everything in extremely well-orchestrated action sequences.The filming of ""Rambo: First Blood Part II"" was made in the jungles of Mexico, a few kilometers from the city of Acapulco. However, director George P. Cosmatos wanted to shoot his film in Thailand, but due to the great difficulties of filming in the jungles there, they even opted for the Mexican jungles. The director gives us a collage of sequences in some logical order that values the fireworks and the heroic frameworks, the iconic poses and the moments surgically made for the viewer to vibrate with a fist in the air every time a thug soldier is beheaded, shot or exploded. Despite the slightly more generous budget than the first film, the scope of what is attempted required a little more money and much more care so that the entire narrative burden did not fall only in the destructive presence of Stallone. Cosmatos is nowhere near the finesse of Ted Kotcheff and the air of ""film B"" is constant. Even so, the director exquisitely conducts some action sequences, with special emphasis on those in which Rambo uses the bow and arrow and the helicopter at the climax of the film. We also have Rambo camouflaging himself in the forest and taking down the platoon of soldiers one by one, in the most inventive ways possible. The mud scene is exquisite. The technical team created war scenes so complex that when the audience left the cinema, they did not believe what they had just seen! Explosions and explosions accompany the film from its half to the end. Most of the visual effects, indicated at that year's Oscars, were recorded or created after filming! The destruction of the concentration camp was quite complicated to be filmed, where a helicopter would machine-gun everything and everyone.From the proposal to keep John Rambo as a reactive hero, a new unfounded persecution of him would be an unacceptable premise. Thus, the script places us in the period after the capture of the character, who receives a proposal for pardon as long as he returns to Vietnam for a rescue mission. He is expected to assist in the search for American soldiers held hostage by the natives even after the end of the war. Many incongruities are identifiable in the franchise, the first one in the first minutes of ""Rambo: First Blood Part II"", when they take a war veteran, arrested for failing to control his trauma and moved by violence, to a place of conflict, just to take some pictures.There is a second forced bar in the script, raising Murdock (Charles Napier) to the leading role with the unlikely decision to abandon Rambo in the jungle when it was enough to descend the helicopter for a few meters and take him safely home. If on the one hand it made this character the most iconic villain in the franchise, on the other hand it is not based on something that makes any sense, creating a nuisance that could be better addressed. In the formation of Rambo's persona, this moment is fundamental, since from then on his existence as an ""army of one man"" is no longer a choice and becomes an obligation. A protagonist configuration that would guide the action films for a long time.Stallone is a monster in the film. His enviable physique, as well as iconic moments such as the red bandage on his head and his calmness in aiming the arrow at the Vietnamese commander who misses every shot, makes Rambo: First Blood Part II a very fun pearl of the ""1980s male film"" genre. "", Almost on the same level as the still unbeatable Stallone Cobra the following year and from the same director. In the psychological construction of Rambo, the maturity achieved in prison does not remove the ideal of disrespect for hierarchy from his mind. At no time does the protagonist appear, in fact, willing to fulfill what has been delegated to him. A way of approaching it that will not be repeated throughout the franchise, making this work the only one that maintains a strong dialogue with the source material. On the other hand, only she dynamizes the beginning of the arc of her plot based on embarrassingly cheesy dialogues, with phrases like ""for me, the mind is the best weapon"" and ""what you call hell, he calls home"". Not to mention the female character, Co (Julia Nickson), who presents herself only to create a fragile sentimental bond with Rambo, in two disconnected and expendable scenes. Errors that would not be repeated in later productions.Rambo: First Blood Part II puts into shock the military pride of the truly patriotic soldier and the feelings of the war veteran who, traumatized by conflict, ends up being socially excluded, becoming a possibly dangerous outcast. This emotional crack in Rambo is a mirror of the very duality of the hero's archetype, a complex imaginary content that travels intensely between glory and tragedy - the latter being, many times, its final condition. Rambo moves the heroic archetypal image by incorporating, on the one hand, an active, virile, warlike and ascendant conduct in the face of his essential anxieties. On the other hand, it activates the dubious heroic symbolism by carrying within itself a fragility that comes from incompleteness, restlessness, incomprehension and hesitation.When we forget the pamphlet character, Rambo II shows itself as a great action film and a great example of brucutu cinema that took over the 80s. However, when we connect critical sense and pay attention to history, the plot of the film ends up becoming difficult to swallow. Therefore, it is better to turn off the critical sense and enjoy all the great action sequences in the film. ""Rambo: First Blood Part II"" is fun and epoch-making. If we consider how many parodies and imitations the film has had over the decades, it is perfectly possible to conclude that it is among the great symbols of its decade, for bad or for good.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
102,Angry_Arguer,Honest Movie,8,9 July 2003,"Rambo: First Blood Part II opens with explosions.  At least it is honest enough to tell us what the whole experience is going to be about up front. It is not about character-drama or inventive plot twists, just explosions. The dialogue is full of such macho jargon that James Cameron would reinforce in ALIENS and would become staples of the ""Jerry-Bruckheimer-summer-action-flick"" (see Top Gun, The Rock).  Taking any shred of the substance seriously can result in a potentially-fatal laughing fit.How this movie was so successful is beyond me, but it cemented Stallone's reputation as a non-actor who grunts, wears a headband, and has no roles other than Rocky available to him.  The script is so full of red-blooded, right-wing, gung-ho jingoism (is that redundant?) that one must wonder if the NRA holds Rambo up as a ""model American citizen"".  Along the lines of the script, it has some of the biggest logic errors I have ever seen.  (HUGE SPOILERS START) Rambo goes to the camp, he leaves the camp, he's captured and brought back to the camp, he escapes from the camp, he returns to the camp, and then blasts his way out of the camp. Brilliant, huh? (HUGE SPOILERS END)Overall, an exceptionally dense and dated movie with little truth in it. 80s nostalgia freaks (myself included) and action buffs will find it tiresome at worst, adrenaline-pumping at best.  Gen Y crazies will not appreciate the movie's historical value on such projects as ""XXX"" and ""Terminator 3"".  Reaganomics at the pinnacle.  2 out of 5.",Rambo - First Blood Part II

Excellent score, excellent special effects and explosions galore. Ignore Ignore Sly's bad accent and all's well that ends well. The ""Stud of Studs"" gives a phenomenal performance. Sly's body is excellent as usual, a lean and mean fighting machine.If you think about it, I've seen p*rnstars with bodies bigger than Sly's. I wonder how these guys manage to keep up their physiques with constant sh*gging??? Answer: illegal and banned STEROIDS in a quest to make their d*ck longer.Back to the film: (PLOT) Rambo is working in a labor camp prison when he gets a visit from his former commander, Colonel Sam Trautman (Richard Crenna). Trautman offers Rambo the chance to be released from prison after the events of the first film and given full clemency, but on condition of him going into Vietnam to search for American POWs. Rambo meets Marshal Murdock (Charles Napier), an American bureaucrat who is in charge of the operation and he tells Rambo that the American public is demanding knowledge about the POWs and they want a trained commando to go in and search for them. Rambo is briefed that he is only to photograph the POWs and not to rescue them, nor is he to engage any enemy soldiers. Rambo reluctantly agrees and he is then told that an agent of the American government will be there to receive him in the jungles of Vietnam.Rambo parachutes into the Vietnamese jungles, but loses most of his equipment in the process and is left only with his knives, his bow, and arrows. He meets the agent, a native girl named Co-Bao (Julia Nickson) who wants to go to America, and who arranges for she and Rambo to go upstream with a group of river pirates. Rambo comes to the camp, and in contradiction to his briefing, he finds American prisoners there and rescues one of them from a makeshift crucifixion. He, Co and the American POW escape with the pirates, but are attacked by a Vietnamese gunboat and are promptly betrayed by the pirates, who fear the military's reprisals would they not cooperate; Rambo sends Co and the POW to safety and manages to destroy the gunboat with an RPG and kill all the pirates. When Rambo calls for extraction, he is denied as Murdock fears what will happen to him and his party if the American public come to know about it.Rambo and the American POW are recaptured. Rambo's wrists are bound to an oxen yoke and he is lowered into a cesspool (or possibly a pit dug especially for the purpose of torture). Later Rambo learns that the Soviet Army is aiding the Vietnamese and training them, and is tortured badly by a Soviet officer, Lt. Col. Podovsky (Steven Berkoff) and his robust henchman Sergeant Yushin. Rambo is ordered to contact the American military and tell them that they should not send any more commandos for rescue operations in Vietnam. Meanwhile, Co enters the camp in the guise of a prostitute and comes to the hut in which Rambo is held captive. Rambo agrees to Podovsky's condition, but instead threatens Murdock on the radio that he is coming to get him, then escapes from captivity into a nearby jungle with Co's help. Co then tends to Rambo's wounds and begins to implore him to take her to the United States. Rambo agrees and they kiss, however they are then attacked by some Vietnamese soldiers and Co is killed. Rambo kills them all (except for their commander, who escapes, but is later killed by one of Rambo's exploding arrows) and then buries Co's body in the jungle.Following his escape, the camp's Soviet and Vietnamese soldiers are sent to look for him. Rambo assembles his weapons, and using guerilla warfare tactics, is able to kill a large number of enemy troops. He proceeds to a small enemy camp and destroys it and several vehicles with explosive arrows. He hijacks a UH-1N Twin Huey helicopter from the Soviets after killing Sergeant Yushin and proceeds towards the POW camp. He destroys most of the camp with the helicopter, then lands and arms himself with the M60 machine gun that is mounted on the Huey, kills the remaining soldiers, and rescues all the POWs. They get to the helicopter and head towards the American camp in Thailand. Lt. Col. Podovsky chases them in his Mil Mi-24 helicopter gunship. Although Rambo's helicopter is heavily damaged by Podovsky's helicopter, he manages to land his helicopter on a river, then fakes his death. When Podovsky comes near him and gets careless, Rambo fires a LAW at Podovsky's chopper, obliterating it.Rambo then returns to the base and wrecks Murdock's command center. He threatens Murdock with a knife, challenging him to find and rescue the remaining American POWs in Vietnam. Trautman then comforts Rambo and tries to pacify him. An angry Rambo responds that he only wants his country to love its soldiers as much as its soldiers love it. As Rambo leaves, Trautman asks him, ""How will you live, John?"" To which Rambo replies, ""Day by day."" Again Crenna puts in a great performance and is complemented by Charles Napier. Steven Berkoff is oustanding as Lt. Col. Podovsky.Buy it on DVD or BLU-RAY. And enjoy on your home cinema.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
104,russem31,A true action film,7,10 March 2006,"Rambo: First Blood Part II, the sequel to First Blood, furthers the adventures of John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone's other breakout role - the first being Rocky), who is reunited with his former commander from the first film, Colonel Samuel Troutman (played by the late Richard Crenna), who sends him on a mission to rescue POWs still held in Vietnam. Of course, things are not what they seem to be. This sequel, is a true action film without making much of a point (the first film dealt more with the mental psyche of the lead character because of his Vietnam War experiences). However, this is as entertaining as the first film due to the action sequences. Again, nice score by the late Jerry Goldsmith. A 7 out of 10.",Rambo - First Blood Part II

The special effects are truly fantastic, the actors are great, the plot was really good and the soundtrack was spectacular. Highly recommend. One of the best films by Sylvester Stallone.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
106,Maziun,Great and underrated sequel,8,7 July 2013,"""Rambo 2 "" is a great follow up to ""First blood "" . Unlike most sequels , this one tries to be something more instead of carbon copy of original. Kotcheff's movie was action-drama with strong anti-violence and anti-war message . Cosmatos goes different way . He's movie is fun action-adventure movie . It's very different , yet still it works very well as the second act of the Rambo's story . We finally get to see what a true killing machine he is.The story written by Stallone and James Cameron is similar to ""Aliens "" , which was released year later. Rambo just as Ripley has to face his greatest fear and go back to hell on Earth, so he could help the American POW. A little bit of history : the concept that American prisoners of war were still being held in Southeast Asia was extremely prevalent in the early 80s. After all , the Vietnamese communists did not release some French prisoners until 16 years after the Indo-China war. As you can see the setup for this movie is not as unrealistic as many complain . It's plausible enough for me. Funny thing – the inspiration for both ""Rambo 2"" and ""Missing in action "" was almost certainly ""Uncommon valor "" made in 1983 (with Gene Hackman and Patrick Swayze) by Ted Kotcheff  director of ""Rambo : First blood"" Sylvester brings a lot of charisma into his character . There is certain magnetism about Rambo which makes that the viewer can't take his eyes of him . Many people fail to see that. In 1985 Stallone was in his best psychical shape as he made both ""Rambo 2"" and ""Rocky 4"" simultaneously. He looks really strong and his physical appearance adds a lot to his persona . Rambo isn't retarded . He's a silent type who speaks rarely , but when he speaks it's always something meaningful. It's also not strange he seems a little odd person after what he experienced in Vietnam. He's not a primitive brute . He knows what love ( for country and for a woman) , friendship and loyalty is. He is able to single-handily defeat army of opponents because he uses his brain . The movie shows us that . It's done in completely believable way. Julia Nickson brings a lot of heart to the role of Co Bao - the Taiwan contact . She makes her character both strong and delicate . Co Bao is also loyal and intelligent. Her performance is unfortunately underrated, which is sad , because she is one of few really strong women in the movies. The relationship between Rambo and Co Bao seems really natural and has an important dramatic aspect . It's one of few love relationship in action movies that doesn't feel like generic love story , but something real.Richard Crenna repeats his role of Colonel Sam Trautman . This movie allows him for a little more dramatic experience . Charles Napier as Murdock is one lovely asshole. Watch out for Martin Kove (the evil karate teacher from ""Karate kid"") as Ericson – henchman of Murdock. The appearance of Russians wasn't really necessary , but they work fine as colorful villains . Steven Berkhoff is very cool as the intelligent Russian bad guy . Funny thing – Berkhoff's most famous role is the role of main villain in ""Beverly Hills cop"" which was a film initially intended for...Sylvester Stallone. The scenery here is looking fantastic . Jack Cardiff's cinematography is impressive as he captures the awesome action in all its glory . Jerry Goldsmith delivers a pumping , majestic score . There is also a nice song ""Peace in our life "" sung by Frank Stallone , Sylvester's brother. Dialogue are witty and memorable . Some spectacular moments – escape from the camp , helicopter chase , confrontation with Murdock.""Rambo 2 "" is a great piece of entertainment . It certainly has it's beliefs and I think it's good to see another point of view on the whole Vietnam war . ""R2"" is a great tribute to all veterans and patriots who love their country despite everything . And the portrayal of Russians and Vietnamese isn't racist , unless you forgot that Vietcong and the Soviets weren't exactly saints . I give it 8/10.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
107,EijnarAmadeus,Enjoyable and totally ripped.,8,22 June 2009,"The second chapter in Sylvester Stallone's portrayal of Vietnam veteran John Rambo is also the second best in the franchise and is arguably underrated in its simplicity. John Rambo, now in prison, gets a visit from Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna) who wants to assign him for a mission that forces him back to 'Nam to locate American POW's. In retribution Rambo gets released from prison and will be given full clemency. Rambo agrees and heads for the jungle, only soon to get both personally and professionally, ""too"", involved. Sylvester Stallone never looked better as Rambo as he does here (fully ripped, hair-band, bow & explosive arrows, a monster knife) and he pulls off the ice-cold stare and emotionless surface of Rambo. And Rambo has for me always represented the way the Americans look at have they should have succeeded in Vietnam, unstoppable and unbeatable, always being morally mixed but following orders that holds bigger political order than a single man's confusion. And 'Rambo: First Blood Part II' feels relatively well paced, and although the totally unnecessary and unsuccessful romance between Rambo and Co (Julia Jackson) tries humanizing our man, the film never tries being something it's not. It's a rock hard action film that delightfully delivers real action set pieces and runs for an enjoyable 90 minutes.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
108,tonypeacock-1,Good but not quite as good as First Blood.,6,18 September 2019,"My proclivities on sequel films are well known. They never usually hit the highs of the original despite the best intentions of everyone concerned with the film production.Rambo: First Blood (part II) is a classic example. Very rarely does a sequel better the original although there are examples. (Godfather 2, Superman 2, The Road Warrior (aka Mad Max 2).
In terms of box-office Rambo 2 as I will call it did well, really well and spawned a plethora of film related merchandise.The plot without spoiling to much involves Rambo returning to Vietnam to free United States P.O.W. still held captive years after the Vietnam War has finished.
Plenty of blood, explosions and a chance for Stallone to show his skills with knives and arrows.
The reward for John Rambo. Freedom from his jail hell and a full Presidential pardon!
That got me thinking, in 1985 when the film was released, Ronald Reagan was President of the United States.Now viewers who have seen First Blood will understand why decorated Green Beret John Rambo is serving hard jail time. However harsh the conditions he now finds himself in.Viewers of First Blood will also remember Richard Crenna as Trautman. The army officer who knows Rambos ability and has a smug grin throughout. The smug grins return!The film fails to have the shock impact of the first despite all of the explosions and scenes of combat with the biggest steak knife you will ever likely see! It fails to explore Rambos Post Traumatic Stress Disorder from his time in the Vietnam War as much as the original First Blood.Sylvester Stallone has never been physically better for such a film. Indeed he sandwiched this inbetween a couple of Rocky films. His stock was at an all time high.Talking of all time high. Look out for Steven Berkoff as nasty Soviet Podovsky who follows a similar role as General Orlov in Octopussy in 1983.One scene did make me chuckle. Rambo discusses being 'expendable.' Many years before that action franchise even was initiated.Look out for the obligatory Stallone/Rambo political statement at the end ala. Rocky IV and the end title song sang by another Stallone, Frank that is more reminiscent of a Eurovision Song Contest entry.The film has higher production budgets than your run of the mill Cannon films starring Chuck Norris of the 1980s era.",Rambo - First Blood Part II

110,gigan-92,"""Not the Worst Film out There..Far from it.""",7,14 February 2011,"If you think about it, this film isn't really all that bad, seeing as it is after all an action film first and foremost. Naturally, this movie's atmosphere and level of psychological intensity is way off from that of the first film's. Gone are any truly noteworthy antagonists, seeing as how in the first film it was somewhat unclear who the real antagonists was. There was more to the original film than blood and bullets, but so be it.Richard Crenna is still pretty good, though the story doesn't really offer him much to do. Stallone's performance doesn't ask much of him, but he plays the role effectively enough. The antagonists suffer greatly from the storm trooper effect and serve only one purpose: to be the pawns of Rambo. The female lead Julia Nickson is okay, but her dialogue was laughable most of the time. With all that said, the action is pretty damn entertaining. And the story, which they could have done so much more with, is intriguing. The all too real scenario of P.O.W.s a chilling one, one Rambo doesn't take too kindly to. There's a good amount of cheesy action, but over all a sense of real bad-assitude. It's a pretty fun movie to watch. Oh, and did I mention the legendary Jerry Goldsmith delivers an awesome score every bit as endearing as the first film's?

112,raypdaley182,Not as good as the original,3,24 June 2007,"The summary pretty much sums it all up. This is nowhere near as good as the original. With a script co-written by both Stallone and James Cameron (at the same time he was also writing Aliens). Most of the action was written by Cameron and the political aspects were written by Stallone.Sly was in the best condition physically as he was making this and Rocky 4 and he does look in great shape or jacked up to the eyeballs on steroids, depending on your own viewpoint or opinion.Rambo starts off in prison and is visited by Colonel Trautman who asks him to go on a special mission that could earn him a Presidential pardon. He eventually agrees and goes off to the briefing camp run by Charles Napier playing a Washington suit trying to pass himself off as former ex-forces to placate Rambo.The mission is to find out if there are any missing POWs still alive in camps in Vietnam. Rambo was chosen as the camp he was checking was somewhere he had previously been a prisoner himself. He is told it's not a rescue mission and he is there to take recon photos only.After a bad attempt at parachuting from a plane he loses most of his kit, meets his contact (who turns out to be a cute woman) and travels down river with pirates to the camp.He finds there are still prisoners and rescues one. As the 3 flee from half the Vietnamese Army on their river boat they are betrayed by the pirates but Rambo kills them all and they are forced to carry on to the pick-up point on foot after their boat is rammed and blown up with Rambo almost on board.Rambo is betrayed again and abandoned as Napier orders the recall of the rescue helicopter. It is clear as Trautman returns to base to berate him that no survivors were expected to be found.Steven Berkoff turns up as a Russian Spetznatz Colonel and Rambo is tortured and eventually escapes only to be pursued by more Vietnamese troops and Spetznatz. Killing many of them, Rambo finally steals a chopper and rescues most of the prisoners to return to his base.He resists the urge to kill Napier for abandoning him but destroys the Ops Centre.A weak plot and very weak ending as Rambo walks off into the sunset as a free man.",Rambo - First Blood Part II

To that fool, I say ""Duh!""
America in the 1980's did have a love/hate with this war. Most of the darker Vietnam era flicks dealt with it much more admirably (""Platoon"" and ""Born On The Fourth Of July"") In this case YOU ARE DEALING WITH ESCAPISM, you dummies. In this version of the war...as Rambo says...he gets to win this time. And rescue his own humanity. To many of you who think American films from this era are too much...this...go watch something else. I'm sure 'The Care Bears Movie"" is more your speed anyway.They made toys for this flick, so it wasn't meant to be taken literally. These people probably believe Wakanda is a place.

118,willcundallreview,Stallone returns as action crazy as before,5,18 April 2015,"Rating-5/10Rambo: First Blood Part II is a Rambo sequel film full of action, explosions and a very crazy solo mission. It's good old action and there's no denying it has it's exciting moments, although to be fair it is kind of over the top and when you have too much of that, it can seem crazy and wildly directed and acted etc. Although without the OTT this movie wouldn't be what it is, so all credit for not giving up on the action, and trying to make it something it's not.I felt the acting here was poor, and not only with Sylvester Stallone, although Stallone never really gives a convincing performance and his only redeeming factor is how good he is fighting here. Richard Crenna returns and although he delivers well, he also feels a little unconvincing, it almost feels like it's all been seen before or something along those lines. Charles Napier as Murdoch is the same again, just unconvincing, but to be fair when it comes to this movie, the acting really is all down to Stallone as he really is the solo star of this movie.Despite the acting the action quota is pretty thrilling and can actually really excite you after a little bit of getting into it, this is truly one for the action movie super fan. The plot is half decent and provides at the least an interesting story for us to go off, it provides thrills, fighting of the most intense and most of all, one man trying to fend off many many others. I wasn't always too sure of the plot though, the ending is kind of rushed and the start can feel a little slow although at least the movie just jumps straight into what Rambo is meant to do for the rest of the movie.The script is written by Stallone and James Cameron, quite a mix but one that actually comes out OK, the script feels real enough and despite maybe the action scenes, the movie is well researched and well informed. I think one reason it is like that is because you have human action man Stallone writing half and then a director and writer like James Cameron who can make the movie seem more human like and actually slightly more realistic. I liked the stunts here, again they are kind of OTT and can seem like ""how did he get out of that one"" but still they are well done in any case. Sometimes the camera work can make the stunts seem a little worse or less dramatic, and it is also the case that some stunts seem unrealistic or just for the sake of making a massive stunt, good nevertheless but would have been nice actually to have slightly died it down just a little.A lot goes on in the movie and they fit everything well into the running time, it feel strange because it can also feel like Rambo does a hell of a lot but in no time at all. It keeps you going I will say and not always in a bad way, it never lets you guess the end and although the action never quite makes this that that believable, it still makes you guess how it will end.Overall I thought it was below average but solidly there, it isn't terrible by any means at all but just not executed well enough to be OK or more. I think they tried too hard to up the ante from ""First Blood"" but end up making an action film filled to the brim with well, action. Well worth a watch for action movie fans, won't stay with you long after but still is a good go at crazy action.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
119,Cinemaniac1984,"No man, no law, no war can stop John Rambo.",9,28 October 2015,"Nobody can deny that Rambo: First Blood Part II is still an enjoyable action movie to watch 30 years on. This time audiences are cheering that the now iconic John Rambo waging a one man war on the bad guys. First Blood (1982) saw a tormented John Rambo symbolically wage war on society following his mistreatment from the small town sheriff's who dismissed him as just another drifter supposedly seen as a troublemaker. This time, John Rambo has the chance to redeem himself.Rambo: First Blood Part II opens with John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) in prison after the events of the first movie. While hard at work with prison labour, his former commander Colonel Sam Trautman (the late Richard Crenna) visits Rambo and offers Rambo a top secret mission in exchange for a pardon. The mission: to locate American POW's in Vietnam which have since been long forgotten. Rambo accepts the mission, which is being spearheaded by the condescending and seemingly corrupt bureaucrat Marshal Murdock (the late Charles Napier) who insists Rambo only take pictures and not engage the enemy under any circumstances. After Rambo parachutes behind enemy lines, Rambo is aided by an allied Vietnamese fighter Co-Bao (Julia Nickson) in his mission to locate American POW's. When Rambo and Co-Bao successfully locate the long forgotten POW's, Rambo is left behind to be captured by the enemy after Murdock orders his mercenaries Ericson (Martin Kove) and Lifer (Steve Williams) to abort the mission. Murdock the embarrassment of Rambo's discovery. After Rambo escapes the sadistic clutches of Vietnamese Captain Vinh (Dana Lee) and his Russian comrade, Lieutenant Colonel Padovsky (Steven Berkoff at his best as the icy villain). While Rambo mows down the enemy left, right and center in his single minded mission to rescue the POW's, he also swears vengeance on Murdock for leaving him behind enemy lines in order to save his own backside.Sylvester Stallone is at his butt kicking best as John Rambo. Sylvester Stallone also co wrote the movie with James Cameron (The Terminator, Aliens). The rest of the case support the movie well. Richard Crenna makes a welcome return as Colonel Trautman, Julia Nickson's acting is a bit hokey as Rambo's allied Vietnamese fighter, Charles Napier and Steven Berkoff both make quality villains, but the real star of the movie is Sylvester Stallone as Rambo. Jerry Goldsmith's energetic score is a real pleasure to hear which adds another exciting dimension to the movie.Forget all the negative reviews surrounding Rambo: First Blood Part II , it's still a pleasure to watch many years later and we will still cheer on John Rambo giving it to the bad guys on screen.9/10.",Rambo - First Blood Part II

In this film, we get to see Colonel Trautman calls upon Rambo from prison and allows him to go into a reconnaissance mission at Vietnam in order to rescue American POW's(Prisoners of War).The movie was not as great as the first one. Added to that,we also see the character transformation of Rambo from being a military veteran suffering from PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) into becoming a military superhero in the sense that he can wage a military war on his own. The sequel presented the this new trend in the succeeding sequels to come.Nevertheless,the sequel was good enough in the sense that it provides the viewer an idea on the military expertise of Rambo particularly during his mission. Added to that,it also provides the American viewer a great fiction of winning the Vietnam War during Rambo's mission.

In it,Rambo becomes a killing machine as a single army on a mission and it provides an explanation on his war expertise and on what makes him valuable to the US military particularly among Trautman's group.No question that a transformation on Rambo was made in the sequel that would make him a new character in it and in the coming sequels of the film franchise. Added to that,the movie raised the standard of violence and it was considered to be the most violent film during its time of release. Aside from that,we also get to witness Rambo as a new character and how the film provided a benchmark on the new action films that are to be released in the years to come.Stallone was truly on top of his game and would become a legendary physical actor for many years to come Finally,it also provides the Americans some sort of a moral victory particularly about the war that they have lost in Vietnam through this movie.",Rambo - First Blood Part II

Sam Trautman shows up one day and offers Rambo a way out...He must accept a mission to Vietnam to investigate unlikely claims that there are still POWs being held there. He goes in intending to take pictures, but when he realizes the claims are true, he engages the enemy, which angers the mission commander, Murdock. He leaves Rambo behind in Vietnam, which throws Rambo into another vengeful frenzy. This movie has a better story and way better action than First Blood, and is way more entertaining.In mood and style, this movie is a lot like First Blood. John Rambo is still a deadly 'Nam vet that's slightly off his rocker, and Col. Trautman is still Rambo's only friend, whose only purpose is to warn others not to screw with him. One change I didn't like was that in First Blood Rambo was spiteful, but in this film he becomes a cheesy ""God Bless America"" action hero, even though he's still angry about the war. The story was much better this time around and had way more exciting action scenes, particularly when Rambo escapes from capture and proceeds to eliminate all of his enemies through various quiet tactics as well as loud destruction. The movie is a cheesy 80's action movie, but as long as you're not expecting a masterpiece, you'll like it.The acting is the same as the first film.

The movie earned over $300,000,000 worldwide with Rocky IV, they were the moust successful and popular movies of the 80's in that time erea. This is the only movie that was Nominated for 1 Oscar the only Rambo movie. Directed was by George P. Cosmatos in which he later reunited with Stallone and directed Cobra (1986). Some people are saying that this movie did not directed George P. Cosmatos that was more Stallone well whoever didrected this movie, it did a great job. Rambo: First Blood Part II is better to me than Commando. I know Schwarzenegger was really angry when he saw Stallone without his shirt with bow and arrow. He got very angry when Commando did not earned $300,000,000 worldwide like Rambo First Blood Part II did. Commando only earned $57,000,000. I think Schwarzenegger was pretty mad like Dick Jones (Ronny Cox) was in RoboCop (1987) on Bob Morton (Miquel Ferrer).John Rambo is Ultimate action hero and this my movie. Rambo is like comic book hero that is my comic book hero. With bow and C4 tip arrows with his knife.Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985) Sequel to 1982's First Blood, Sylvester Stallone returns as John Rambo, the former Green Berret who is given the opportunity for a Presidential pardon if he accepts a mission to confirm the existence of American POW's captured during the Vietnam War.The movie has ton's of action great writen by James Cameron who wrote many action sequences that is why Rambo: First Blood Part II is great.The action sequences I love: Rambo fires with a shotgun 870 at the pirates, this is the first time I see Rambo using a shotgun. Rambo uses a M60E3 machine gun blasts bad guys to pices and saves American P.O.W. in the camp. The same machine gun Schwarzenegger uses in Commando and it was later used in Predator. Rambo flips up the iron sights on the mockup RPG-7. grenade launcher and blows Vietnamese boat to hell. Rambo with Hoyt Archery compound bow high C4 explosive tip arrows is memorable to me. He blows the bad guys vehicle. Lots of explosions and practical effects. Rambo uses his helicopter's skills and blows the bad-guys to pieces. Rambo has a survival knife and uses on the bad guys. Rambo fires a C4 tip arrow on a Viatnamese commander and blows him to dust is my personal favorite scene.I love this film to death. Sylvester Stallone did a great acting performance as John Rambo ex-Green Barret Vietnam Vet. Julia Nickson as Co Bao did a great job playing her character who helps Rambo out. Charles Napier as Murdock is a bad-ass villian. In my opinion Charles Napier and Brian Dennehy are memorable bad-guys in Rambo movies. Charles Napier was also a bad guy in Hard justice (1995) David Bradley movie. He was like Murdock in that movie. I miss Charles Napier R.I.P. he is not forgotten not by me. Richard Crenna as trautman I love him, he is more a father figure to Rambo. Martin Kove as Erickson is another villian. Martin Kove is John Kreese and The Karate Kid trilogy and Cobra Kai series. Martin kove is an excellent actor. Steven Berkoff is an excellent villian as Russian commander Podovsky. He was in Octopussy (1983) James Bond 007 movie and Beverly Hills Cop until he was cast in this movie.I love the politics in this movie in which Trautman talks to his nemesis Murdock. You have Viet congs and Russians as the enemy in this movie. It is rated - R practical effects real stunt performed no CGI effects in here. Beautiful music score by Jerry Goldsmith even much better than in First Blood. I love the soundtrack on the end of credits Peace in Our Life sung by Sly's brother Frank Stallone.Rambo: First Blood Part II is my personal favorite sequel it is an pure bad-ass action classic of the 80's. Deserves to be up there with Aliens (1986) and Die Hard (1988) one of the greatest action 80's movies of all time. I prefer this sequel over ""First Blood"" and ""Rambo: Last Blood"" that is my opinion. I can't wait to see Rambo: Last Blood (2019) in movie teater.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
125,zac-04879,"Dull, Average and Weak, Despite Brilliant Action",4,5 November 2021,"Although Stallone will never execute a flat John Rambo, we'll eventually receive a flat Rambo movie - and it's unfortunately now arrived. This sequel to the excellent actioner, First Blood Part II, continues to provide its fans with handfuls more of explosive action and battle sequences. However, there's an unexpectedly major lack of the exhilaration and creativity that was presented in the original.Sylvester Stallone brings back his excellent performance, only to have it slightly weakened by the new plot. The rest of the cast just deliver some average and typical performances that we see every day in movies. But the story is probably the main flaw; it's not anywhere near as gripping or fascinating as the first Rambo.The tiny amount of credit left goes to the fine direction and the brilliant effects during the appealing action sequences. The film can really turn from the flat tracks to the appealing tracks, simply when we move from slow dialogue to explosions and war.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
126,stormhawk2021,Best guerrilla action film ever,10,27 June 2017,"Sequel to the awesome First Blood, First Blood Part II revolves around John Rambo is sent into Vietnam to take pictures of a supposed abandoned POW camp. When he finds that the camp is still operational, he liberates a POW and subsequently gets betrayed by the men who hired him to get the job done. After this, he takes matters into his own hands and takes on half the Vietnamese army and a squad of Russian troops and attempts to rescue the other POWS's. First Blood Part II follows the events of the first film and the mission that Rambo goes on is a chance for him to get pardonned over the events of the first. First Blood Part II is a solid sequel that offers everything you'd expect from a Rambo film. Sure some aspects of the film are silly, but the key words you need to remember is this is a Rambo film, you should expect something over the top. The film delivers the usual top notch action thrills with decent acting, but as usual it's not anything great. But what do you expect in the acting department of a Rambo flick. Though lacking in some aspects of the picture, the film more than makes up for it with it's action. Thats the reason why Rambo films are excellent, the nonstop action. The filmmakers know how to craft a solid actioner, even at times if it's not truly perfect, there are a lot of things going for this film that surpasses the low points. As far as action films are concerned, First Blood Part II delivers everything you'd expect and more. First Blood Part II is an underrated film that doesn't deserve the flack it has received. Sure it's totally different, but there's an interesting plot to keep you entertained. Even if the plot is average, the action is flawless and its what makes this film a blast to watch again and again.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
127,illbebackreviews,Disappointing compared to the first but still an entertaining film...IT'S NOT A MASTERPIECE!!!,6,18 May 2013,"The first Rambo film is a cult classic and one of Stallone's best performances. When making a sequel to a great action film, these films suffer. Examples being Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, Terminator 3 and 4 and several other beloved action flicks. Whilst certainly not horrible, Rambo II is not much similar to its predecessor but instead relies heavily on big action scenes. Great performances by Stallone and Richard Crenna, as well as some exciting action, even if it isn't at all like the original and a few character moments save this from being a total disaster of a film.John Rambo was arrested at the end of the first film for the damages and deaths that he caused in a town. Whilst in jail, Rambo's commander arrives and apologizes to Rambo for the life he now lives and offers to send him back to Vietnam to search for some lost men and thus, give back Rambo his freedom. Reluctantly agreeing, Rambo travels back the world that he so dreads.The acting is truly great by some and truly annoying by others. Stallone and Crenna are absolutely fantastic in their respective roles with Stallone once more giving such a physical and energetic performance. Every kick he acts or every fire from a gun shot feels as crazy and over the top as it should. Stallone even shares a few slightly emotional scenes which are handled well, despite much of the film being a mess. A character like Rambo could be a hard one to like but Stallone certainly brings a likability and pity towards his character. Crenna and Stallone share great chemistry for the few scenes they are in together and their friendship feels like one that two would experience during war time.Something that makes this a near unrecognizable Rambo film is simultaneously one of the more enjoyable parts of the film and that is obviously the extremely over the top action sequences in the film. The original Rambo film was restricted in big action scenes but more so used the ""predator"" method. Rambo was a predator who sneaks up on his enemies to eliminate them, occasionally letting himself be spotted by enemies. This was a true magic of the first film but here, Rambo is constantly shown revealing himself to enemies and simply firing shot after shot. Even though he occasionally hides in the film, he is often seen by enemies and completely altering the tone of the film through this. This makes it feel less intense, despite some exciting action sequences. Whilst the original Rambo felt like a late 70s action flick, Rambo II certainly has the feel of an 80s action flick.Whilst the action scenes are good and bad to the film, the film is truly redeemed enough by a few great character moments such as the final scene involving Trautment and Rambo. Here, Stallone gives a small speech that is well done and is an image that could be formed in one's mind. Other great character moments are involving Trautment, especially early on where he expresses his concern for Rambo. These moments, though not much, do help to save this film for the better.'Rambo: The First Blood Part II' is definitely one of the most unrecognizable sequels to one of the cult classics. This sequel's immense difference is evident through big dumb action scenes that go on longer than expected, providing far less emotion and core to the story than the previous entry. New characters aren't as interesting as from the first and the story is largely one to not buy. Whilst Rambo II makes for a good action flick it doesn't necessarily make for a great Rambo film but isn't a completely horrid one due to some very great performances and a few great character moments.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
128,gabriel_sanchez,A one man army.,8,22 July 2018,"As usual, Rambo didn't do first blood. Part II sets Rambo back on Vietnam for a simple mission: take pictures of a dead camp. Of course things aren't as simple as it is.It's linear 80's action. Some tough stereotipical dudes, a lot of testosterone and gun/bow/hand-to-hand fighting.Stallone's acting is good, same goes for Crenna, Napier and Nickson; the rest is acceptable-ish.A good no-brainer.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
129,jerekra,My Favorite Rambo Film.,9,16 May 2009,"First Blood Part 2 is my favorite of the Rambo Films. It is a great action packed film with great acting, plot, and meaning to it.Rambo is given the chance to leave prison if he agrees to help the military. He agrees. His mission; to go into Thailand and take photos that prove that there are no soldiers held prisoner. However as he arrives there, Rambo soon discovers something that may complicate the mission.One thing that I like about this film is that this time Rambo is a hero that we can cheer for. In the first film he was kind of a tough guy who fights with cops a little, but really is not a hero nor a villain. But this time he is clearly a hero. Also it is great to see him out in the jungle where he is able to maneuver around and show how good he is in the wild.Stallone is awesome as usual. This is one of his better portrayals of Rambo, gets to show lots of different emotions; Anger, frustration, sadness, and determination.Rambo gets in a lot of great action. THis really is one of the best action flicks of the eighties and that is saying a lot. Rambo gets to use his bow and arrow for the first time in a film and that is great because it is a unique weapon that fits him. Also gets to use his knife and a lot of guns. Also there is an awesome helicopter chase scene. THe last half hour is action at its best.The supporting cast is great as well. Trautman is great, and Murdock makes for a great jerk military guy who really is a coward deep down. Co Bao was an interesting character in that she gets the film into a romantic mood for a little. Ericson is also interesting in how he is played by Martin Kove, who I always will remember from the Karate Kid films.If there is a complaint I guess it is that the film maybe starts a little slow, but not really, and there is some lame action parts. But it is a great action film like I have said before.So, a great film that has a new idea in that Rambo is clearly the hero in this film. Great action, acting, and overall one of the better action films of the eighties. Highly recommended.",Rambo - First Blood Part II

131,torstensonjohn,Iconic Second Telling,5,19 June 2019,The two most iconic and legendary characters for film are Rocky and Rambo. Sylvester Stallone brings to life these physical specimens of men that break the mold of heroic. In the second chapter of John Rambo we find him doing hard time in a labor prison when Colonel Trautman comes calling. The storyline takes the character back to Vietnam to locate a camp and take pictures of anything that resembles POW's. The audience relates to the struggles and pain endured by Rambo's expressions. This is NOT a great film by any stretch but coming off First Blood this flows perfectly in the storytelling. The writing is typical Stallone with good flow and character development. The audience will leave this film with great pride for the character. Good sequel.,Rambo - First Blood Part II
132,Ziya90,Pure action,7,11 February 2010,"Rambo 2 is a non stop action movie. Events develop too quickly and it is not as powerful as First Blood may be, because there is not exactly a story, pure action, but a cult action classic though. There are great action sequences that leave some unforgettable moments and images for cinema's sake! For example the radio scene or the snake scene or the arrow scene. This is one of the best action movies ever made. If see Rambo 2 and Shooter at the same time, you will see the difference. I seriously got bored while watching Shooter, the new trend, new action movies... My favorite action sequence in the movie is the one which Rambo attacks with the helicopter. Arrows create too big explosions, but cool. And Part 2 has a legendary, unforgettable closing scene. However, this time not touching, funny! The scene that Rambo prepares for the operation is legendary with the legendary music. Now, it is time for replying ideological criticisms. It is said that Rambo movies are fascist movies. They don't know what fascism means. This is an action movie, Rambo is a war veteran who goes missions, operations again, so? And one more thing, I don't think that he is interested in politics. It is said that Rambo is a shameful cold war propaganda. Always the same stuff, this action movie is propaganda, that action movie is propaganda, this movie is racist, that movie is racist. According to some critics, every movie is ideological, every movie carries political and social messages. They represent ideological cinema. It is said that Rambo movies are very violent, bloody movies, they always bring up the number of the dead people in the movie to the agenda. However, they love David Cronenberg movies, Takeshi Miike or George Romero's dead trilogy, right? Does Rambo eat soldiers? In Rambo movies, people are killed by weapons, explosions etc. in some other horror movies which the same critics admire, people are eaten or disintegrated etc. in much more gruesome ways! Returning to the political stuff, may be the conversation at the end is unnecessary, but this is an action movie, period. I find some reviews even malicious or ridiculous. It is said that Rambo movies are women hater. Really? Then why Rambo falls in love with an Asian girl? They brainwash us, be careful!",Rambo - First Blood Part II
133,kingofdanerds,Perhaps I judged this film too harshly before viewing it,8,11 December 2020,"First Blood was a box office hit and the formula in the 80s was that if it made money, a sequel had to be made and that was the case in 1985 when Rambo: First Blood Part II was released in theaters. (For the sake of this review, lets just call this film Rambo II). Rambo II was an even bigger box office success making $300 million at the box office. Not only that, but it did well with video rentals. But, critics were split on this film. The film recieved several nominations at the Razzies and even won a few like Worst Film of the Year. But audiences seem to love this film. The film sees the return of Sylvester Stallone as John Rambo and Richard Crenna as Col. Trautman. The film was directed George P. Cosmatos and had a screenplay by James Cameron and Sylvester Stallone.The film follows Rambo who is in prison due to the events of the previous film. Col. Trautman arrives and tells Rambo that if he takes part in a top secret mission, he will be set free. Rambo agrees and the mission involves going back to Vietnam and taking photographs of a camp that has POWs. His orders also include not to rescue anyone and not to engage the enemy. But we all know that if Rambo wants to get something done, he does it his way....I wrote this review after my first viewing of the film. Before watching the film I had this idea that Rambo II was going to lack the seriousness of the previous film and just be an over the top action film which would get a mediocre review from me. But, I was largely wrong. Sure, I can be here all day and talk about everything that is wrong with Rambo II but there are lots of things that Rambo II does well. When one compares this film to the original First Blood, there are differences. First, the whole tone. First Blood had an overall serious tone. Rambo II does somewhat retain that seriousness but not 100 percent. This film basically is straight up and says it is an action film. First Blood does not do that and goes with the more serious route of telling the story of a Vietnam vet who is fighting a war like no other. The action scenes here are done extremely well here in this film. The action scenes here did give me an adrenaline rush. They are fun, entertaining, bad ass, and most importantly well shot and well edited. There are several notable scenes here like the helicopter chase or the various hut explosions. But is it over the top? Most of the time no, but there are a few instances where it is. For example, the explosive arrow. I am not an expert or anything but, I am almost sure that when an arrow hits a truck that a massive explosion occurs. A big one, yes. A massive one? I don't think so. But who cares anyways it is fun to watch. Throw in a nice musical score by Jerry Goldsmith to accompany these action scenes and it is truly a real pleasure to watch. Plus, the violence is heavily increased but that will not be mean anything till the 2008 Rambo film. I think where this film fails is in it's story and acting. First, the story. The story is John Rambo being given orders to take photographs of a camp and to not engage the enemy or rescue any of the POWs. I knew from the very beginning that Rambo was not going to do that. They supply him with all of these weapons and stuff and it is like they are asking for him to not follow orders and to go and blow everything up. The whole plot will at times be forgotten in times where there are really big action scenes. Events (that is everything that is not explosions and action scenes) in this film are fairly predictable and can be seen from 100 miles away. The film at times does try to pull a page from First Blood by working with the Rambo character but it is not done as effectively here in this film. When comparing which version of Rambo is better (First Blood or Rambo II) I would probably go with First Blood for the fact is is that Rambo in that film was a little more interesting and there was emotion and what not. We don't get that in this film. What we get is a one man army. But that does not make me mad in the least bit. The acting is not great. Sylvester Stallone does not give the best line deliveries but does decent in this film when he acts without even speaking. Richard Crenna does a fairly good job here. Martin Kove (famous for his role in The Karate Kid movies and reprising it in Cobra Kai) does not do much except make that weird face. The acting otherwise is not great but far from being the worst out there. I watched the documentary included on the Blu-Ray release and I can see the time and effort that was put into this film. I have high respect for everyone who worked to make this film a really entertaining film.Rambo: First Blood Part II is not a perfect film and is not as effective in the way that First Blood was. But, seeing this film was lots of fun. It is an easy film to sit down and watch and watch again.",Rambo - First Blood Part II

It just was and is a very good film and I did enjoy watching it but the film did have a few faults to it.
The film had some very good acting by Sylvester Stallone, Richard Crenna, Charles Napier, Martin Kove, Steven Berkoff, Julia Hickson and George Cheung. The only thing I didn't like about this film was Steven Berkoffs acting and accent as the Russian Lieutenant Colonel Podovsky. Man his acting and accent as the Russian Lieutenant was absolutely awful and I hated it. He was better in Beverly Hills Cop as Victor Maitland than he was in this film. The other actors acting in this film was very good and i did like the acting by Sylvester Stallone, Richard Crenna, Charles Napier, Martin Kove, Julia Hickson and George Cheung and did like it much more than Steven Berkoffs awful acting.",Rambo - First Blood Part II

At least at that place he can't hurt anybody.... let him rot there.A high level operative is corrupt (of course), but he tells Dumbo to just take pictures. That doesn't happen.

137,fredericksmith1952,Second film in the franchise and heading slowly downhill.,7,2 May 2012,"Second film in the franchise and heading slowly downhill. While the level of action is certainly maintained in this second installment of the legendary Rambo, the film seems just a bit under the excitement level of the first. The addition of the Soviets in this film is certainly an accusation from Stallone's perspective, and I am sure managed to ruffle a few diplomatic feathers at the time (there was a Soviet Union in 1985, kiddies). Because of that, the film was shot in Malaysia, since we had no real relationship with Vietnam at that time. So you have to understand the crew was working in miserable conditions with mosquitoes large enough to hold a gun on you while they sucked your blood and humidity thick enough to slice and eat for breakfast. As to the characters, Rambo seems a bit mellower following a three year stint of making little ones out of big ones. Trautman seems like he has lost his self confidence when dealing with Murdoch. And speaking of Murdoch (played by Charles Napier), would you ever trust a word this guy says? Martin Kove is the perpetual pseudo tough guy who has a small and fairly inconsequential role. The remaining cast is straightforward and somewhat boring, but overall the film is entertaining and does have the merit of putting the POW/MIA issue on the forefront. Rated R for violence, disturbing scenes, and language, First Blood 2 is worth seeing once and collectible if you have the set or love Stallone.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
138,BJJManchester,"Ludicrous,Lame-Brained actioner of the 80's",3,25 May 2007,"An offensively over-the-top action adventure,FIRST BLOOD PART II seemed to catch the mood of the US at the time of it's release in the mid-80's,with right-wing Reaganism and virulent anti-red feelings still not finished yet,though the emergence of a certain Mikhail Gorbachev in the heart of the 'Evil Empire' in Moscow would soon render these types of films redundant;even Reagan himself eventually admitted this truism.In that sense,we can be most grateful to 'Gorby',not for his disarmament treaties with the US,nor his policies of 'glasnost',or even his support of democracy being restored to the Eastern European countries in the former Soviet Union's backyard.No,it's the final diminution of foolish,jingoistic,bloated cold-war adventures like this.The first RAMBO film was hardly perfect,though at least was a mildly literate and adequate action thriller with a not too bad storyline.In this sequel,any sense of even the remotest conviction is instantly jettisoned for silly,senseless plotting and incident in which Rambo single-handedly takes on scores of brainlessly stereotyped Vietnamese and Russian troops to rescue American POW's ten years after the conflict ended,with the Americans on the losing side.Perhaps the reason why the film was a huge box-office success was to let many Americans wallow in fantasy;they may have lost the war,but there was still unfinished business at hand,and ludicrous comic-strip heroics with a robot-like hero killing virtually every red on sight,with as much hardware as possible,fulfilled such whimsically far-fetched ideals.This could have been entertaining on a SUPERMAN/SPIDERMAN level,but sadly everything is played absolutely straight.But that is not to say that there is no humour in the film;sadly it is virtually all of the unintentional kind.The action scenes,though technically adequate,never once carry the slightest bit of conviction or persuasiveness,because they are always placed in the most spectacularly unbelievable of contexts;namely,our hero Rambo is always unscathed (aside from a few cuts and bruises here and there) despite the tons of explosives,grenades,gunshots,etc.going around him.In between the mayhem,what there is of a script consists of the dullest clichés and banalities.Stallone,who co-wrote the script with James Cameron (a long way from the exciting TERMINATOR made the previous year),deliberately seems to have given the Rambo character as little to say in understandable English,and merely comes out with moronic grunts,almost as though he has invented his own brand of patois only understandable to himself.Maybe his colleague Cameron was thinking of The Terminator again with so little communication involved for the lead character! In this sense Rambo seems even less of a human than the Terminator did! The rest of the cast do little better with good actors like Charles Napier and Richard Crenna doing their admirable best with the hackneyed dialogue they are given,and Steven Berkoff hamming it up outrageously yet again with another of his Russian KGB/Red Army villain roles.Berkoff's overplaying is mildly enjoyable but not remotely menacing.How come that Sly managed to survive Berkoff's electric shock torture to kill yet more of those Red Commie scumbags? Well,credibility is never this film's strong point.It is a work of fantasy comparable with THE WIZARD OF OZ.At least that WAS meant to be a fantasy,and an immortal classic it turned out to be.This is only a classic of the most dismal,and indeed offensive,kind.And as for Sly's climactic speech...,rather hypocritical after slaughtering all those people,eh? By the way,in the same year,he also made ROCKY IV..........RATING:3 out of 10.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
139,LuboLarsson,One of the best action films ever made,8,7 July 2002,"Viewed as an action film, Rambo First Blood Part II is hard to beat. It just never lets up, and it has Stallone at the top of his game. Its comic strip stuff, and is much less credible than First Blood. I don't care about that though, you want a serious film then watch The Deer Hunter or Platoon, but if you want to see a superbly made action film watch this. After the events of First Blood, John Rambo is in prison but gets released to be sent back to Vietnam to take pictures of a pow camp to get proof that there is still American pow's there. But he is double-crossed by his superiors when he tries to take some pow's out with him, he wasn't meant to do that, he was ordered to only take photos, so he's left behind to be captured , imprisoned and tortured by those oh so nasty RUSSIANS! Sly really had it in for the reds in 1985 after this film, he sent Rocky out to Russia to beat up that other nasty Russian Ivan Drago! It must have been what the people wanted as this and Rocky IV were two of the biggest smashes of the year. Steven Berkhoff plays the Russian bad guy in practically a carbon copy of his role in the James Bond film Octopussy, he does it well though, he was one of Hollywoods favourite bad guys of the mid 80's, you might remember him in Beverly Hills Cop, which was a film initially intended for........Sylvester Stallone!

141,jmillerdp,Reagan-Era Wet Dream,4,27 June 2015,"After the great ""First Blood,"" the Rambo series immediately sinks into complete jingoism with this thoroughly absurd sequel. Here, it is the obsession with ""winning"" The Vietnam War for war-hungry conservatives who were too gutless to ever go into battle themselves.And, that includes screenwriters Stallone and James Cameron, who get sucked into the whole Reagan-era obsession with winning, even if it is a war that was as close to un-winnable as you can get. The United States could have given every drop of blood we had. But, the South Vietnamese just didn't have the passion needed to fight for their own country. So, no matter how hard we fought, there was never a solid foundation to build anything upon. That's why the south fell the second we left.It doesn't matter that tens of thousands of American soldiers died fighting. For the Reagan types, it was all about putting one in the win column, nothing more. The Reagan era was all about their belief that the world was purely black and white, instead of the infinite shades of gray that it actually is.That's why it's tough to divorce the premise of this movie from its action, its filmmaking, etc. All of it is competently carried out. And, it's all carried out quickly, because Stallone wanted a brief 90-minute run time.

They caused damage to this country beyond the imaginable and this movie continues the fairy story of the oh-so innocent soldiers. The only bad guys were the leaders of the nation, who made this war happen. The character of Rambo is perfect to notice this. He is extremely patriotic, bemoans that US-Americans didn't appreciate and celebrate the achievements of the single soldier, but has nothing but distrust for leading officers and politicians. Like every film that defends the war (e.g. ""We Were Soldiers"") also this one avoids the need to give a comprehensible reason for the engagement in South Asia. And for that matter also the reason for every single US-American soldier that was there. Instead, Rambo gets to take revenge for the wounds of a whole nation. It would have been better to work on how to deal with the memories, rather than suppressing them. ""Do we get to win this time?"" Yes, you do.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
143,shaun98,Entertaining trash; must-see for action fans,6,23 September 2002,"**minor spoilers**The second ""Rambo"" film has forever sealed the series' reputation as pure cartoonish, testosterone-driven action cinema. It's so overblown you can't take it seriously; Stallone heads back to Vietnam to rescue American prisoners of war, effectively acting as a one-man army as he blows up Viet Cong and Russian Communist forces. The climax, in particular, is so awesomely goofy you can't help but admire the filmmakers for going as far as they did. It shamelessly panders to our then-renewed sense of national pride, to the extent that Ronald Regan openly praised the film and mentioned it in his speeches. Note the now-legendary first scene where Rambo asks, ""do we get to win this time?"" ""It's up to you,"" replies his mentor. It's a scene that could only have been filmed in the 1980's. It was not a decade burdened by political correctness; in some ways action and horror movies were a lot more fun back then. Stallone doesn't really do a lot of acting here, but he's perfectly good for the material. His excellent screen presence and tough-guy looks do more here than ""heartfelt"" performances could ever do under these circumstances. His astonishing physique is certainly a sight to behold, and there's little wonder that this is the role many people immediately associate with him, with the possible exception of ""Rocky."" Charles Napier makes a welcome appearance in one of his trademark ""tough military officer"" roles. Not a very multifaceted character, but in this case a very effective one; easily the best performance in the film. Richard Crenna reprises his role as Colonel Trautman from ""First Blood."" He settles comfortably into the part, but his role in the story is somewhat more superficial the second time; he's there mainly to advocate for Rambo. Steven Berkoff is adequate as a Russian officer. Julia Nickson-Soul gets a rather thankless role, as the aforementioned love interest, but at least she doesn't get in the way of the action. If it makes little logical sense, at least it has more life than some of today's soulless corporate offerings. They wouldn't have the nerve to do many of the things this movie does, in such politically incorrect fashion. It really doesn't matter that Sly's love interest is so perfunctory, or that there's no real reason for him to be double-crossed in the middle, or that the politics are so murky. Its only reason to exist is to deliver the action-packed goods. James Cameron had written the original script, and was even attached to direct at one point. I wonder how it would have been different in that case, but by now there's little point in pondering the issue. Just relax and enjoy.

The film is exciting, tense and packed with plenty of action. It also does have something to say about the treatment of Vietnam veterans after the war, although of course that is never allowed to get in the way of the important business of Rambo shooting and blowing things up. Stallone actually manages to bring a sense of gravitas to his role, making the character a little more than just a walking killing machine. However, it is fair to say that there are very few surprises in the film.It's well worth giving this one a shot, especially for action fans.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
147,blazesnakes9,"What you choose to call hell, he calls home.",7,25 September 2013,"Every once in a while, an action movie comes along and seems to make itself work for its reasoning of the story and elements, which can be sometimes questioning. And that's the case in Rambo: First Blood Part II. Sylvester Stallone plays John Rambo, an ex-Green Beret who is in prison for what he has done in the first movie. If you remember from the first movie, Stallone's character was hunted by a small-town sheriff and the National Guard. In that film, he stages a one-man war against them. Now, his colonel decides to give Rambo a mission. The mission is to go back to Vietnam to take photographs of the American POW's that were left behind in Vietnam. But, Stallone, like any other action hero tough guy, doesn't listen. Instead, the movie shows him doing what he does best, mowing down the enemies with a machine gun. One thing that I like about the movie is the exploding arrows that Rambo carries in the movie. I'll tell ya, those exploding arrows really come in handy. Now, there are logical errors in this movie that some people can point out. In one scene, Rambo attacks one of the Russian soldiers in the jungle. He camouflaged himself with mud. Now, you may ask yourself a couple of questions. What if the soldier walk past Rambo and Rambo didn't get the chance to attack him? How did he cover his other arm with mud? That kind of movie error may be obvious, but to me, it's just a rub-off. This is the kind of movie that action movie-goers will love. It has its moments of errors, but that didn't stop me from liking it. Rambo: First Blood II is a exciting, adventurous, movie. It's action sequences are over the top and very visually stunning and does what any other big action summer movie does. You sit back and watch the excitement roll over you. ★★★ 3 stars.",Rambo - First Blood Part II

The best line is spoken by the colonel: ""Rambo is of Indian-German descent - what a combination"".  Well, looking at myself then, I wonder how Indians must look like. But, one should never think too much when watching this film. It has fantastic music, lots of explosions, and one (and only one) hero: John Rambo, my half-German brother!

Containing so much explosions, kills, blood, fire, explosions, murder, arson, did I mention explosions!?!?!? Rambo is so bad ass he kills 76 people in two days (more than his confirmed 56 kills throughout the entire Vietnam War)!!!In terms of a Rambo movie however, it's awful. The characters don't feel like real people (everyone is a cartoon character), the plot is generic and predictable, and there's so much hamfisted political commentary (we know the Vietnam war was bad, you don't need to keep saying it, show how it poorly affected us like the first movie did!!!!).The only bright spot is Stallone being back, even if he doesn't feel like Rambo.This film is definitely entertaining, but it lacks depth when you actually think about it.

Rambo remains a serious, disturbed character. I can't remember an instance where he spit out some one-liner.But the film and plot itself is much more ""cheesy"", if you will.

152,WorldMovie99,Thoroughly enjoyable !,8,2 September 2021,"Good action. The fireworks is just enjoyable. Forget about the reality for a moment and see it for the action sequences. Sylvester Stallone as the tough patriot, is the most suitable person in the movie. The other things like story, performance are well to do alongside with its actions.The movie gives a message of being loyal to nation. It's important even for the victorious to keep aside corruption. It's not about Socialist- Democratic war. It's about anti corruption in state affairs. A movie with different entertainment angles and messages. Rambo is an honest guy with high destructive ability still serving his nation but not in a dishonest way. A protagonist that is loveable and still in that position today. The movie progresses revealing the political issues mixing with personal profits. And that too in the top of hierarchy. The character of Russian officer is good but his bodyguard is unintentionally funny. Rambo from his burning desire of revenge towards his betrayal to his Mission Accomplished statement is worthy of watch. A heavy action packed movie with few turns in the story.The technicals are good, the scenic locations of Vietnam, the background score, the war sequences are praiseworthy. But ultimately, in any way you will be entertained. Stallone Sir is really a great action hero.",Rambo - First Blood Part II

This series is getting old and Rambo is no longer a solider but a cold blooded killer. Ever time he turns up on the screen someone dies. Vietnam was not a fun place to be and frankly I am tired of Hollywood making it seem like it was. This is not the worst of the films concerning Vietnam, that honor goes to John Waynes Green Berets. In any case John Rambo carrying around a 50 cal Machine Gun taking on what seems to be half of the Viet Cong army plus a good many Russians is an insult to watch. What is worse is Rambos cheesy speech at the end...Please!! Oh yeah I heard they are making another one...",Rambo - First Blood Part II
155,saint405,Rambo is back and ready to kick butt,7,28 July 2005,"Rambo: First Blood Part 2 is about Colonel Trautman releasing Rambo to join his army in a top-secret mission to go to different country where American POW's are being held up as prisoners. Rambo is told by his commander to only take pictures but Rambo disobeys orders and rescues a live POW only to have his commander betray him and leave him behind enemy lines. Now it's up to Rambo as a one man army to save himself and a whole load of innocent people. Now Rambo II is just as good as the first film. The idea though is that it has the same characters but it is thrown into a different background with a new objective. Stallone and Creena give solid performances as Charles Napier is perfect as the slime ball commander who betrays Rambo. The plot feels confusing at first but ounce Rambo starts to kick butt, you understand right away. Now the action is top notch. Ramob blowing heads off with explosive arrows, a duel between helicopters, leech torture, knives in bodies, etc. That is what Rambo is all about, he's an action icon. Though the film is flooded with blood, the film falls low in some scenes. The so called love scenes with Rambo and his accomplice is boring and the briefing scenes take to long. Though the film is challenged a few times, it's very entertaining. Rambo 2 gets a 7 for being a great action film though it is slow. Recommended for action nuts and fans of the original First Blood.

156,Umar Mansoor Bajwa,Best Commando Guerilla Action Film Ever MADE !,10,15 June 2005,"The fame of Sylvester Stallone initially picked up with The Rocky series. However, he did not settle to create only the icon of Rocky Balboa. His ambitious and craggy nature took him to endeavor the creation of a new kind of hero cum macho man yet unknown to cine-goers.Rambo was the culmination of an American war commando who was taught and weathered to sustain and persevere in the most unfavorable, hostile and cruel conditions. Under enemy captivity in Vietnam while trying to rescue American POWs, he showed stoic fortitude and the solid grit not to bend before the enemy bullies. Sylvester Stallone's body and features that seem to be chiseled in stone bore a perfect resemblance to Rambo's character sketch. Richard Crenna as Col. Samuel has also portrayed a good role as Rambo's mentor.This is by far a most popular and fascinating depiction of a new style of action, adventure thriller of its time and definitely rose Stallone to new heights of stardom and instantly established him as a top favorite Hollywood icon.",Rambo - First Blood Part II

158,charlessmith702210,"Perhaps the best sequel of ""First Blood"" since the original Rambo movie began, showing his great Green Beret expertise",10,1 August 2013,"Well, here it is....John Rambo, who ends up in a prison labor camp for creating a rampage in a suburban city after hiding from police officers after being caught by police for loitering in the first Rambo movie, ""First Blood"", has a second assignment.His very strong Green Beret experience will mean a great asset. Of course, in the original First Blood, strong mention of his experience in the American elite special forces in Vietnam is key for him when he gets freed from the prison camp and sent right back to Thailand in a sort of one-man mission--to free American POWs from a prison camp that most people said was empty after the Vietnam War was over. With help from Murdock, John goes into that jungle again, meets up with one of her helpers, Co, an intelligent Vietnam lady, and then finds one of the POWs. Then, at daybreak, they escape but mercenaries are on John's tail out for a kill. John manages to use a bazooka to destroy an enemy gunboat, but could not keep up with the rest of the Vietnam platoon at the extraction point at a hill where a USA helicopter finds him and the POW. Sadly, Murdock suddenly tells the helicopter to go back to base probably because Murdock thinks one POW is not enough to convince him.The Vietnam soldiers then capture Rambo and the POW, and Rambo is subject to the worst torture ever in his military career. First, he is in a bath full of leeches, and then forced interrogation, and then, an electric shock cage featuring about 700-800 volts of current...thanks to Col. Podovsky, a top brass who is on the side of the soldiers who captured both Rambo and the POW. Podovsky then warns Rambo that his POW- rescuing mission is espionage and must stop..or his freed POW gets killed. The turning point is when Rambo, forced to speak under duress to a radio, says to Murdock that he had enough.Rambo then knocks out several of his interrogators, knocks another one right into the electric shock cage and shocks him, and makes his escape. Sadly, in the middle of the escape, while trying to rest in the forest, the evil Vietnamese general shoots Co in the chest, and Co dies. So, he decides to go all-alone to free the rest of the POWs. As soldiers come in for Rambo's kill, Rambo kills some of them with arrows...and then kills more with arrows laced with incendiary bombs. Finally, Rambo kills the evil Vietnamese captain of the platoon with another arrow...So the only gauntlet left is Podovsky. One of the helicopters w/o Podovsky but with soldiers on the side of him inside drops an incendiary satchel barrel at him...but Rambo dives into the jungle waters as soon as the bomb explodes. The soldiers then saturate the water with machine gun fire but Rambo explodes out and takes out one soldier out of the chopper and commandeers it. Then, Rambo, on that commandeered chopper, manages to use the armed weapons on that aircraft to take out over 100 enemy soldiers, and land just near the area near the prisoners are, and release 4-5 more prisoners from that camp. The POWs are now in the chopper, the chopper is about to head back to base....but with one last problem.Podovsky with his fully-armed Soviet-made military chopper is out for revenge against Rambo. Podovsky fires incendiary missiles at Rambo's chopper, and spray machine-gun fire but the POWs were able to knock out Podovsky's sidekick gunner. Podovsky responds with a direct missile hit on Rambo's chopper on one of the side engines, forcing to land on the water. Then Rambo plays dead as the rotors continue to spin as the helicopter remains stationary. Podovsky's helicopter then very slowly approaches towards the other chopper face-to-face for a final coup-de- grace shot to finish off Rambo, but Rambo hears the chopper, does a pretend sleep (Podovsky does not know this) and immediately bursts out with a rocket launcher, breaks one of the windshields and immediately fires a shot at him..and just before Podovsky could fire..his chopper blows up...and Rambo wins.Rambo then brings the crippled chopper back to base and then Murdock's sidekick then congratulates him, but Rambo's distrusting anger explodes as he beats him bad with his M-16. Then he goes to the computer facility inside the base to release more anger, spraying hundreds of M-16 rounds destroying the computer equipment. Then, jettisoning the M-16, he bursts into Murdock's office, and Murdock gets a taste of his own medicine by Rambo's continued anger, making him see the Rambo knife up-close. He doesn't kill him but he makes him afraid...and then, Rambo leaves him alive, warning him that he better find more POWs that he did not find yet besides the several Rambo found...or worse will be in store for Murdock. Finally, a colonel who saved him in the first Rambo movie says that you don't need to return to prison...you are pardoned for the rescue of the POWs, but Rambo says that he still wants to celebrate his new victory alone.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
159,ericjg623,Great Stuff!,8,21 August 2002,"It's impossible not to like this movie. When it was released in 1985 it was a huge hit, and with good reason. It finally put the lie to the notion that America was the villain in Vietnam while the VC and their Soviet allies were the heroes. In this movie, the latter are shown as sadistic scum, while Rambo, representing American values, is shown as brave, principled, and resourceful. When, at the beginning of this film, Rambo asks ""Do we get to win this time?"" he speaks for every American who felt betrayed, whether it was by self serving government bureaucrats (represented by Murdock, Rambo's loathsome commanding officer) or left wing so-called intellectuals who stabbed America's fighting men in the back. This movie rips on both types of scum while celebrating the ingenuity and sheer guts of the American fighting man. Rambo will not likely be added to the list of ""great"" war movies, but, in its own way, it helped shape our culture, and change America from a land of Alan Alda/Phil Donahue type wimps to a self confident nation that could kick the crap out of Saddam Hussein and the Taliban.8/10",Rambo - First Blood Part II

Well, the whole clue is in the ""bamboo cages"" detail this fantasy out of a Milius ""ground war would happen"" wishful-thinking wish-fulfillment fest would perhaps opine as possible, but, folks, the cruel truth is in what that implies: Somebody still has to *watch* and *feed* these people, and the replacement of steel for ""bamboo"" doesn't make it any more tenable. The sad truth is, after generations of people who were servants or slaves or at least went to WWII these people found their loved ones documented, nametagged, part of the machine, and unaccounted for. Probably, had cooler heads prevailed about hard truths difficult to tell people -- if firstly, more difficult to face inwardly by oneself -- you wouldn't end up with a trite piece of crap like this trying to answer questions in the wake of Coppola's ""symbolic"" ""Apocalypse Now,"" the compassionate ""Coming Home,"" and the inaccurate but archetypally engaging ""Deer Hunter"" -- the sort of logic that inverts or affirms movie logic as though there was no other point of view to draw towards or from (an approach Clint Eastwood has hit upon with ""Unforgiven,"" and been varying, with varying degrees of success, every since). Suffice it to say, if you get your history from movies (remember: this is the decade of Reagan!) and not from journalism, or at least from *accounts*, you end up with one radically mislead population. It's probably more germane to look at Stallone's admitting he had ""run out of ideas with 'Rocky II,' and 'Rocky III' is just about training and preparation for a fight"" -- is this a reason for this movie to exist? Is this a reason to mislead the population, let alone those who have *no answer* for their loved ones? The answer, apparently, is yes: It's not even propaganda, because it's not trying to convert you, it's just trying to entertain. Boo-hoo, the bad guys lose, the good guys win, you're loved ones are on Mars, it's just Buck Rogers is the only one who knows how to get there, we haven't developed the technology yet? What crap.

Jim Rambo returns again in this first sequel to the first film First Blood. Rambo has been sent to prison after his escapades in the previous film, but he is happy there as no-one annoys him. When General Kirby (based on the 'popular' Nintendy character) comes a knockin, we know Rambo will help and the fun will begin. This film has many much more excitement sections than the first film, tones more fights, loads more action, and proves that sequels can be better than prequels.A bunch of soldiers are believed to be still held captive in the woods of Vietnam. Charles has them. There is no proof however, so Brian Dennhardy and the guy from Karate Kid decide to get the proof. They don't want to dirty their own clothes though, so they tell Kirby to send in Rambo. Rambo believes he is going in to save his fellow psychos, but really he is a guinea hamster and the bosses have no intention of saving the men. Rambo is dropped in front of enemy lines with his trusty knife and has to find the men in 2 days or be left behind. Joining him is a pretty local woman who he falls in love with. This twist makes Rambo one of the most romantic films ever, as well as one of the most action packed. Of course their relationship is tragic, and when something bad happens I wanted to jump into the TV and scream 'NOOO!' and start shooting all the bad guys, including the good guys. The film also shows that you can never trust your bosses because they just want to leave you in the jungle. The main bad guy is so evil that it really feels great when Rambo gets him. Yeah, take that you scumbag! There are lots of good one liners in this film, like when the bad guy is going to poke Rambo's eye out he says 'I must break you' and Rambo simply says 'Go For It!' before snapping his neck. 'What mean expendable?' the girl asks. 'It like when I is invited to a party, and there is beer and I drink some beer, and then I drink another beer, and then I drink lots of beers and make a silly of myself but no-one cares. That mean expendable.' That one line pretty much sums up America's involvement in Vietnam for me.All the clever college stuff aside, what we really care is the action. How about these? Rambo infiltrates the bad guys' hideout, and slices 10 guards' necks. He is captured and electrocuted, but still manages to destroy everyone and escape with his bare hands. His canoe is attacked with machine guns and rocket launchers and he has to kill all the bad guys and jump out before it explodes. He steals a Helichopter and blows away hundreds of bad guys! He chases the main bad guy around the forest with a bow and arrow while nukes are dropped around him! Yes, this is a truly awesome film which all true movie fans need to see.Best Scene: When Rambo returns to his base and searches for the bad American guys. He shoots all the computers and screams and says a big speech like the first film.

169,DaRick89,"I enjoyed this the first time, but then two things happened - I got older and I saw Commando",5,17 February 2006,"Rambo: First Blood Part II presents an interesting case. It kicked off the 'mindless-action' series of movies, so to speak. Movies where a muscleman could go in and kill a whole lot of people without getting so much as a scratch. Movies which made teenage boys think that war and killing were fun. These have been referred too as 'Rambo rip-offs', or 'Rambo films'. It is therefore unusually ironic that this movie, despite kicking off countless imitators and having it's name engraved in movie history for doing so, isn't even the best of it's kind. It isn't even the best movie of it's type to come out in 1985 (in my opinion, that honour belongs to Commando). I enjoyed 'Second Blood' (as I am going to call it for the rest of this review) the first time I watched it, as a bright-eyed 12-year old. But something happened to me: I got older. And so, when I watched it the second time, I didn't enjoy it quite as much. Indeed, I found it to be a stupid film which didn't have as many thrills for me as I thought it would. The corny, uncomfortably patriotic ending helped to solidify this opinion. Anyway, in Second Blood the filmmakers attempt to add a little depth to the plot, bringing in a very random and pointless romance, along with an infiltration of the POW camp at night, but it soon becomes little more than a vehicle for lots of random explosions and Sylvester's bow-and-arrow, as I expected. You see, Sylvester has to gather intelligence on POW's in Vietnam, but he is sold out by his superiors and left to die at the hands of the Soviets and Vietnamese. Of course, he escapes and what I said would follow ends up, whatd'ya know, following. Marvel as Sylvester somehow evades like, whole SQUADRON's of Soviet and Vietnamese troops! Marvel as Sylvester kills all of them and blows stuff up (yes, you heard me) with his bow-and-arrow and his pinpoint accurate (?!) machine-gun! Marvel as all of these troops somehow all manage to miss Sylvester from like, 50 metres (using automatic weapons of course)! Not that there's anything wrong with this stuff happening (look at Commando), it's just not as entertaining as it could be - and that's a pretty damning indictment, considering that this is meant to be a 'mindless action' film.Now, about the cast - aside from Sylvester and Richard Crenna, it's pretty ordinary. Stallone is alright as our heroic muscleman, but he somehow doesn't quite have Arnie's charm playing more or less the same role. He has more bravado, but not as much charm. Crenna is OK, but has little to do. The rest are fairly nondescript, including Napier as Murdoch.As for the film's technical quality - well, for lack of a better description, it looks a hell of a lot better than Commando ever did, but that isn't saying much, as Commando's technical quality is at best, poor and at worst, non-existent. This more or less means that Second Blood's technical quality is only average at best.I could go and on about this film's inferiority, as an entertainment spectacle anyway, to Commando, but I won't. I'll just say that I checked out this movie's rating just before writing this review. Guess what it was? A paltry 5.2. I can fully understand why as well, for if I ever decided to write a definition of what the rating 5.2 (out of 10) meant, it would be something like this: Passable, but mediocre. That definition fits Second Blood perfectly: passable action fare, but not a lot more, making it perhaps unfitting that this movie kicked off a whole genre.2.5/5 stars",Rambo - First Blood Part II

171,furiousneon,Just Below The Original.,10,20 July 2003,"The original First Blood was Classic.  This is right behind it.  Stallone reprises his role as John Rambo, The Green Berret we all love, and Richard Crenna comes back as Colonel Trautman.  The movie starts off with Rambo in prison working, hard labor, as Colonel Trautman comes and informs him that there will be a secret mission to look for POWs(Prisoners of War) in Vietnam and that he was one of the only names that came up in a search for people who would be suited for the mission.  The movie is a lot more action based then the first installment but still holds on to some emotion and in my opinion, you couldnt ask for a better sequel.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
172,Celluloid_Fiend,An Action Icon For The Ages!,6,23 October 2019,"As the second installment of the ""Rambo"" saga, this film definitely ups-the-ante in terms of action and body count. ""Rambo: First Blood Part II"" takes Rambo back to the jungles of Vietnam, where most of the mental traumas that dog him began. His mission is to search for missing POWs, instead he falls right back into a war that, for him, has never really ended.As I said, the action in this film goes way beyond anything we saw in the first one (but with James Cameron as one of the screenplay writers, that's not exactly a surprise). Less content to let the personal and political dramas propel the action, this film is pretty much the reverse, with the action being cause to create those plot developments. In many way, this film seems to forget the humanity shown in the original and opts to let the excitement of the moment wash over you, like the backwash of an F-16 fighter jet, as the explosive battle sequences blast you against the back wall. Although, while extremely over the top in almost every stunt and fight, to the point ungodly suspension of disbelief is pretty much the order of the day, it is a beautifully choreographed bloodbath to behold. It basically, for good or ill, set the stage for what the 80's action epic would be expected to achieve for the rest of the decade.While not exactly a deeply emotive character in the first film, Sly gets even less moments here. There is no understanding to what Rambo is feeling being back in the place that has tortured him so. There is almost no attempt to play on those feelings at all, save an all-too-brief scene on a boat, between Rambo and the young Vietnamese woman (played by Julia Nickson) who is helping him in the mission, but that's as far as they go to give you any idea on what Rambo is thinking and feeling, being back in 'Nam after all this time. I would have liked to get into Rambo's thoughts more, as the traumas he'd suffered there could have added even more depth to an emotionally complex character. But that simply isn't what this film was about.Richard Crenna reprises his role, as Rambo's C.O., but he gets very little to do in this film. Whereas in the first he was a key to understanding Rambo and used to contrast the political themes that were presented, here he is merely a very small cog, used mainly to set up the plot to get Rambo back into action. He does have one very intense scene, where he argues with the slimy Washington bureaucrat (played by Charles Napier), which brought back a momentary flair from the first film, but it is over quickly, as the need to get back to the jungle slaughter is the paramount concern here.""Rambo: First Blood Part II"" was less the ending of an iconic character's saga (not the least of which is due to the fact two more sequels were made) and more the start of replacing character-driven action, with action-driven drama. It created a new standard for what action films could be (and in many cases, would be) from that point on. It set up a game of constant oneupmanship with the other action stars of the day, as they all attempted to outdo what this film began. In some ways, this film is almost a whole new entity, completely separate from the original film in every thing but the characters names, yet it is also strangely completely bound to it. As a sequel to a film that had some very deep philosophical and political themes, this film fails to recapture almost any of that same spirit, but in terms of spinning the action film genre into an ever growing and testosterone-fueled behemoth, determined to make the impossible seem probable, as well as solidifying Rambo's status as an 80's icon for all-time, the film succeeds on a level no other film could ever hope to manage. This is truly the film that epitomizes the phrase, ""check your brain at the door and enjoy!"" Which I am more than able to do.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
173,sheepmonk2000,Rambo has lost his edge,2,6 June 2011,"This film ain't sharp, the characters aren't fleshed out enough and some of the dialogue is appalling (which I found surprising as it's co-written by James Cameron). Like I said the characters are pretty much one dimensional and some of the dialogue is incredibly corny. The story itself is weak and the action sequences wouldn't look out of place in any other war/action movie, yet somehow manage to look substandard when compared to films such as Predator or Platoon. Stallone does his dogged best with what he has to work with, but the story is so predictable that he fails to really ignite himself in this his second outing. Where the first Rambo was a brilliant stand off between Stallone and the local sheriff, this film has been filmed on a much bigger scale which inevitably has meant some of the characterisation/character development as been shafted in favour of loud bangs and big muscles. Therefore, I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, bar those looking for some brainless but by no means fun action.

As I get older I find myself watching it as a piece of guilty-pleasure escapism.""First Blood"" is one of my favourite movies. So when I heard the sequel was on its way, I had major expectations for it. I have to say that when I saw ""Rambo: First Blood Part II"" I was disappointed. I felt that it started off well; we find out that John Rambo got 8 years hard labour for destroying the town in ""First Blood"" and that he wouldn't be released until 1990. Once Trautman appeared and offered Rambo the choice to go looking for American prisoners of war in Vietnam, it began to seem less like the gritty psychological drama of the first film and more a piece of pulp fiction.The premise is basically that instead of sending all their forces back to Vietnam, the U.S. government will just send one guy: their best, John Rambo. He'll restart the Vietnam war single-handedly, take on the Russians as well (as they were the unseen baddies of 'Nam supporting the North Vietnamese) and give them all a damn good kicking. Then Rambo will destroy the prison camp in a brilliantly-shot-and-edited orgy of destruction, defy orders and rescue the American prisoners instead of just taking photos. He'll fly over the border and back to base in Thailand and go after the sweaty Nixonians who abandoned him and who, Rambo claims: ""...wouldn't let us win!"" In another well-shot and edited orgy of destruction (just look at those pornographic shots of the spent gun shells ricocheting off the floor!), Rambo takes out the command centre and storms off into the wilderness to become God's lonely man again. THAT'S a movie! As a sequel, it's still a disappointment, as a film in its own right, it does exactly what it says on the tin: ""No man, no law, no war can stop him!""

I like the fact that it doesn't rely on corny oneliners and dialogue like the third film did, and whereas First Blood did a good job of establishing John Rambo as a PTSD afflicted war vet, this film completely turns itself on its head by having Rambo killing countless scores of enemy soldiers in his path.Overall, a fairly good film.

179,Aphex97,The movie that made Rambo a household name,6,12 June 2001,"This sequel is pure action. Sadly, it is not a gripping, compassionate human story like First Blood. It was written by Stallone and James Cameron, so I would have expected more in terms of plotline. However, the plot is sufficiently interesting to move the action along. George (Leviathan, Cobra) Cosmatos directs with a stunning visual flair. The action is tight and over-the-top, but thoroughly enjoyable. One finds oneself rooting for Rambo, and cheering when he blows the bad guys to bits.Stallone contributes another stellar performance as the stiff John Rambo, who is both a tortured soul and a deadly war machine. This movie made the term ""Rambo"" synonymous with rough ,tough indestructible b*****d. A film that any action lover will find indispinsible.

182,Illini_Wrestling_Fan,Westworld Sequel Enables 9/11,9,1 January 2021,"Fresh off the successes of Rhinestone and Piranha 2, respectively, Sly Stallone and Jim Cameron penned an epic mindbender of a script that took John Rambo from troubled loner to the sole defender of God, truth, and the American way.Three years after the events of First Blood wherein Rambo rampaged in a Washington hamlet, his old pal Colonel Sam Trautman concocted a Rambo-centric scheme just crazy enough to work. Building on the android technology of the Delos company the US military decided to invest $31 million (based on Trautman's recommendation) in Operation Second Blood, aka Vietnamworld, to re-engage the best soldier ever produced by the Big Green Machine (keep in mind Cameron wrote the first draft of the script still having killer robots fresh in his mind from The Terminator).After an executive order got Rambo shipped from his dirty, sweaty prison to the dirty, sweaty base in fake-Thailand where he would soon be launched into a world of robo-warfare, human pencil pusher Marshall Murdock is tasked with transitioning Rambo from the real world to the Westworld-ish staged battlefield all without Rambo figuring out the difference.A cockamamie story about POWs in Vietnam a long 10 years after the war ended was just wacky enough to convince Rambo to come back into the Army's fold, as Trautman knew it would be. The Delos Corporation's Vietnamworld, actually carved out of a Mexican jungle, was the perfect proving ground to let Rambo whet that bloodthirsty appetite for destruction.The initial airdrop goes according to the generals' operational plan, with Rambo hung up by a stuck chord during his jump. As Delos model B600 (greasy blonde henchman version) pretends to try to free the stuck rope Rambo is forced to cut loose most of his deadly equipment and ability to photograph/document the scenes below. After he lands on Mexican soil (thinking he is in Vietnam) Rambo meets up with the most advanced Delos model yet. Both a fierce fighter and passionate kisser, Co gets more mumbled answers out of 'Bo than any human ever did.It does not take long for the robotronic mayhem to ensue, with a raging gunboat battle on the Papagayo River sparking the long-glowing embers of warlust inside Rambo's soul. He soon finds the cyborg POWs, noticing they are still in possession of full sets of teeth (albeit dirty teeth) after over ten years without toothbrushes or dental care. Though he also suspects that something is amiss after he has slaughtered a dozen men while receiving barely a scratch himself, it is not until he is abandoned at the rendezvous point by Murdock's rescue chopper that Rambo truly comprehends that not all is as it seems.When a Russian platoon arrives (interrupting Rambo's sewage bath) and starts ordering around the proudly independent Vietnamese soldiers it becomes blatantly obvious that everyone on the ground except Rambo is a robot programmed by Ronald Reagan's four-star goons. To insure that Rambo is sufficiently motivated to cut out and eat still-beating communist hearts in future conflicts, the programmers have the Soviet musclebot shock the captured American on a rusty torture rack made of bedsprings and wrist restraints, adding a side dish of beefcake as Stallone flexes the chest Turinabol built.Now that he has uncovered the truth, Rambo sets his sights on Murdock-""I'm coming to get you!"" he threatens over a coerced radio call. Co Bao, coming to the rescue by hiding in the crawlspace below the interrogation room, abets an improbable escape and Rambo decides to embrace the situation. Realizing he does not need to reload the magical Vietnamworld rifles he goes berserk on Russian and Vietnamese robots alike in a stunning display of automatic weapon mastery, basically matching his 60 confirmed real world kills in one skirmish. During a lull in the action just before he can consummate things with the Co-bot the programmers intervene to add another revenge angle by having head Vietnamese baddie Sgt. Tay and his minions slaughter Co near a picturesque stream where her processor goes dark in Rambo's HGH-chiseled arms.Blood then flows like hot salsa in the Mexican jungle as Rambo embraces the training simulation. He is shocked to find that advancing on a Russian helicopter pilotbot with a knife causes it to jump out of the cockpit to the jagged rocks below (fascinating AI). As a final insult to the programmers Rambo fires a rocket launcher from inside a helicopter full of robot POWs, certain murder-suicide to all involved - anywhere but here in Vietnamworld.Returning in said helicopter to the the staging area in ""Thailand"" also known as Acapulco, the best scene of the film begins. Unlike in robotland Rambo actually loads his M-60 rifle with a belt of real ammunition and proceeds to destroy Murdock's control room where he watched all the programmed horrors. The writers shine here with the foresight not to discuss the proverbial robotic elephant in the room, with the dialogue quoted below:Murdock: Rambo, I swear to God, I didn't know it was supposed to happen like this. It was just supposed to be another assignment!
Rambo: Mission... accomplished.
(thrusts knife into table)Rambo is letting Murdock know that he knows what just happened, but he goes on to inform Murdock that this crazy plan actually worked and the method can be used to help other troubled vets to regain the eye of the tiger and once again become skilled killers like Rambo. He goes on:Rambo: You know there's more men out there and you know where they are. Find 'em. Or I'll find you.His after-action report complete, Rambo starts to walk the dusty road to Acapulco but is accosted by a concerned Col. Trautman who wants to be sure that Rambo can now be counted on to destroy Communism on all fronts. Though Rambo defers with an impassioned monologue, as we soon find out in 1988's Rambo III (spoiler) our beloved freedom fighter will do anything it takes to bring down the USSR, even help the Taliban.Sadly if you are one who ascribes to the view that the Taliban share some responsibility for the 9/11 attacks then you must also blame these films for allowing that group to consolidate power after receiving the Rambo seal of approval.

184,connorbbalboa,If this wasn't a sequel to First Blood...,5,28 November 2016,"To this day, I only know of two franchises where the first installment is so different in tone and film making quality to the rest of the series: Rambo and Godzilla. While with Godzilla, there still managed to be a few good movies in the series before it all went to hell (see Mothra vs. Godzilla as an example), with this movie, whatever good came from First Blood (first in the Rambo series) goes to hell almost immediately. The plot is that Sylvester Stallone's Rambo II (which I will be calling him from now on because he is almost nothing like the character from the first film) is visited in prison by his former Special Forces commander, Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna), who offers him freedom in exchange for going back to Vietnam to rescue American P.O.W.s from the same prison camp he escaped from in 1971. Leading the mission is government bureaucrat Murdock (Charles Napier), who then orders Rambo II only to take photographs of the place so the government can move into the camp later. Rambo II realizes too late that this was all just a ruse by Murdock so that the camp would still be declared empty and the government would forget about the issue (there's quite a bit of politics in this film). This film commits two major crimes as a sequel: the first is that it is not true to the original film; the commentary on how war veterans should be treated on the home front is placed on the back side in favor of some wild and unrealistic action, as entertaining as it may be. The second crime is that it changes the character to fit the film. In the first film, Rambo was a wrongly-treated veteran who was angry and frustrated at his country for persecuting him and fought back in retaliation. Now, Rambo II seems to think that his country placed him in prison for a good reason (he was arrested at the end of the first film) and he seems perfectly calm, with any signs that he is a traumatized war veteran being all but invisible. Perhaps if my standards for cinema weren't high, I'd be more forgiving, but as it stands, these two crimes prevent me from being as such. The villains are also one-dimensional, with Viet Cong soldiers who think that they are being more threatening by hitting their prisoners every few seconds. The two big baddies though, are this Soviet Lieutenant Colonel and his strong, silent type assistant who suffers from the same problem as the Viet Cong. If I was Rambo II, I'd say, ""You know, manhandling me every five seconds isn't gonna make you more threatening. In fact, it looks rather silly, doesn't it?"" Despite these problems, the film does have some good things about it. For instance, the cinematography is so appealing to watch and really makes the jungle look more attractive (despite the fact that this was filmed in Mexico and not Vietnam), and the action is entertaining on a primitive level. There are also a few decent performances by Napier, Crenna, and Stallone, although the P.O.W.s do act pretty cheesy, and newcomer Julia Nicholson could have made more of an effort as Rambo's romantic interest, Co. All in all, if this wasn't a sequel to First Blood, I'd give it a better rating (maybe a 7), but since it is, its two major crimes really do tear it down quite a notch. This film works best as an outdated artifact from the 1980s, due to its style of action film making, or as a piece of propaganda (same simple politics as Rocky IV: Communists = bad, Americans = good).",Rambo - First Blood Part II

187,Turin_Horse,On how to turn a compelling story (First Blood) and an interesting character (Rambo) into a ludicrous joke and a parodic hero,2,21 November 2020,"Probably no other sequel in cinema history has so completely turned upside-down the spirit and true meaning of the original film. While First Blood presented an interesting variation of the well-known returned-from-Vietnam character who has been shown in many films, with a pathetic side yet willing and able to fight back when pushed around, Rambo II shows us a sort of reborn superhero who will bring justice to the aggrieved and ruthless punishment for the culprits.First Blood can play in the same league as The Deer Hunter or Born on the Fourth of July (being, notwithstanding, inferior to these two). Rambo II cannot play in any league aimed for decent films. Leaving aside the campy acting by most of the cast and the laughable characterization of Mexican soldiers as Vietnamese, the main problem with the film is that it takes a well-crafted character from a previous film and turns him into something completely different, bluntly breaching the spirit of First Blood and creating a new scenario fully detached from the original one.The subsequent sequels (I only watch parts of Rambo III) seemingly follow the same path. A pity, since First Blood could have remained a good example on the topic of unadaptability on returning to homeland, with the additional pull of setting the scenario in a remote deep America location and the clash between the locals and the wandering hero (antihero actually in this case).",Rambo - First Blood Part II

Trautman on a top-secret mission: to find and take pictures of missing POWs in the jungles of Southeast Asia. Should he succeed, he would be granted a presidential pardon and have his sentence lifted.Rambo: First Blood was an ultra-violent movie with a strong social message over how ostracised and neglected the Vietnam veterans are viewed upon vis-a-vis their parents who fought in World War II and in Korea. However, I can't say the same thing about this one: Rambo gets sent back to the jungles that brutalised him to take pictures of MIAs (?) before he finds out that he has been set up and left for dead by Murdock, the corrupt bureaucrat who hired him. Rambo takes matters into his own hands and becomes a one-man-army against a slew of Southeast Asian troops and armed Soviet advisers.The script is self sufficient, Stallone still impresses with his physique and performance, and action sequences are top-notch and creative. It's a little too different from part I where it was a cat-and-mouse game. This time, the mouse is out to get the cat. But the new supporting characters such as Co are not as colourful as those of the previous movie, and the villains are stock and cliché.Totally unrealistic and redundant (what did you expect... ""A Passage to India""?) but satisfying guilty pleasure.

190,mhthehammer,The best Razzie winner by far,7,28 May 2020,"The first movie First Blood was a riveting survivor story and character study on a retired Green Beret questioning his existence. The sequel Rambo: First Blood Part II tosses aside the main character's shellshock in favor of a crowd-pleasing, mindless, but fun action movie. John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is called into a mission from Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna) and Major Marshall Murdoch (Charles Napier) to find the possible remaining prisoners of war in Vietnam. Then, the Soviet troops, who are in cahoots with the Vietcong soldiers, kidnap Rambo, but that doesn't stop our muscle-clad hero as he escapes and returns the POW's back to the Colonel. Usually when a sequel is released, it performs extraordinarily in the box office despite being a terrible movie. Similarly, Rambo: First Blood Part 2 has that same inception, but it's the type of movie to put your brain behind the door and have fun watching Stallone wielding a gun shirtless with explosions behind him. Unlike the more complex and unique predecessor and the book it's based on, the sequel is riddled with mass explosions, Commies being shot in a line, clichéd lines, ridiculous weapons of choice including explosive arrows, and melodramatic death scenes. These moments make you totally forget that the prison guards did nothing to stop the military from breaking out Rambo in the first place. In other words, Rambo: First Blood Part 2 is the epitome of a popcorn movie, one that is spectacular, but no words of a vernacular will describe this great event, so the audience becomes dumb with wonderment.

This movie made a left turn from the first one, taking Rambo out of retirement and in the line of fire. I love the landscape in this film, makes the action set pieces more unique. Another fast paced film that makes the time go buy really fast and makes you want to take out enemy targets. Mrs. Nickson does a great job as Co Phuong Bao. I feel as if Mr. Napier as Murdock was the brother of the cop from the first film? Tell me what you think? I still think they write Colonel Trautman as if he's worshiping Rambo which comes off a little cheezy. Maybe he's selling a Green Berets training program, who knows? The character development is weaker in this one I feel the only thing we got was a softer side of Rambo next to a lady. But who gives a Sh🎬t it's an action movie. Anyways the climax of the movie is action galore and are well choreographed so if you don't like violence, please STAY AWAY.",Rambo - First Blood Part II

193,beerwine900,When action movies were still good,8,19 September 2007,"Rambo part 2 is completely different from Rambo first blood. First blood was quite psychological and had a lot of close quarter combat using that 10 inch bowie knife of his, Rambo part 2 uses a 10 inch bowie knife but just more and there are more gun fights and explosions he even has a bow with explosive arrows.Basically Rambo part 2 is a full on action movie with no extras just gun fights a ex green bureau who wants revenge for various reasons who also happens to be indestructible and to be honest thats why i like it.All the Rambo movies are quite ridiculous at times but are great movies to watch when your bored with nothing to do, this movie came out 4 years before i was born but i grew up watching stuff like Rambo, commando, under siege and terminator so i was always the odd one out at school when i was the only one who thought the TX 1000 terminator could beat the crap out of Neo (Matrix).Rambo was made in 1985 so the fight scenes are very raw and more realistic there are no wires but it is the 80's so there are silly moments but generally the fights are very right hook left upper cut type stuff no fancy kicks or running up walls thank god.Sly Stallone plays a good tough guy and was in great shape when he played Rambo i know this because in this and Rambo 3 he always manages to some how get his shirt off like most body building action super stars. Steven Berkoff is a mean baddie and the henchman type guy who fights Rambo isn't really a match as he was two big and slow. Richard Crenna fits the part of colonel Troutman well.over all Rambo part 2 is a great action movie with excellent stunts and very enjoyable i give it 8 out of 10 and would recommend it to any action movie fan.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
194,tingnting,Stallone at his best,6,24 August 2006,"This is an all out action fest, featuring Stallone at his most muscular. I would say it's the second best action-hero movie of the 80's, the best being Predator.Stallone manages to hold on to that winning formula from First Blood and repeats it here. This time he returns to Vietnam on a secret mission to take photos of a prisoner camp that is said to hold American POW's from the Vietnam war. When the helicopter pilot is ordered not to pick him up from the agreed rondezvous point, Rambo opens up a can of kick-yo-butt. In the process he manages to free the prisoners, sabotage another helicopter and fly them all back to the base.Lot's of explosions, gun fights, hand to hand combat and relatively few special effects.Take a look at the garbage that Stallone produced in the 90's (Judge dread, the specialist etc) and you'll agree that the 80's was his best decade.All in all I just to have to remark about how incredibly well built Stallone is for a man who was circa 40 years old when this movie was made.Definitely one to watch if you dig Stallone and explosions.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
195,F0RCE,Do we get to win this time?,7,26 March 2001,"""Rambo:  First Blood Part II"" gets the job done in terms of following a great film in ""First Blood"".This film is not only a terrific action film, but it captures the spirit of the Cold War.  The historic significance is illustrated when Trautman describes the refusal of war reparations to the Viet-Cong and their decision to keep the P.O.W.'s.  This was an incredibly important issue at the time and Stallone's script portrays it as that.Charles Napier and Martin Kove do an excellent job as the bureaucrat and the mercenary, that provide the resistance to Rambo's success. 
Rambo is given a second chance to win in Vietnam.  His mission is to recover photographic proof of American P.O.W.'s still being help captive.  Thats right, Rambo has to take pictures.  He ends up going above and beyond the call of duty.  Nobody expected him to return, except Col. Trautman. 
Stallone brings stage prowess and a great story to the screen, and it is a great follow-up to the original.  Well worth a look.",Rambo - First Blood Part II

I paid attention to the action and just ignored the bad dialogue.  I mean, the movie does have some nice shots of guns, I admit. But later on, I realized that this movie is not art.  I paid more attention to its poor cinematography, drama, character development, music, and suspense.  It was much too Hollywoodish (if that's a word, which it probably isn't.)  Stallone, although the best choice for Rambo, has wasted his name with two bad sequals to a thought-provoking original.  Everything in this movie is a big disappointment.  I've lost my respect for this movie, thank goodness.  5/10",Rambo - First Blood Part II
198,DamianThorn,"Much more a pure action film than it's predecessor, but still an excellent movie.",8,10 June 2014,"First blood was a very poignant look into the mind of a Vietnam vet, traumatized by war and lost within himself. Rambo First Blood Part II is certainly still a vivid portrayal of the Rambo character and still filled with moments that make clear unadulterated statements about war and those left behind to die. It is however much more an action film than First Blood.This movie centers on Rambo, freed from prison by the US government to re-enter Vietnam and locate prisoners of war. Unbeknownst to him, he's not intended to find anything and is expected to return empty handed. When he actually does find POW's alive and still being held by the Vietnamese, he refuses to leave them behind and engages in a one man war to save his former comrades.Like all of the Rambo films, this movie is beautifully made and nearly flawless in its production. Stallone plays Rambo just as he did in First Blood. When you see him in character, it's so clear that the role to him means much more than it would for most. Richard Crenna returns as Colonel Trautmen and once again plays his role perfectly as well. A really nice surprise in this movie though are a couple of other familiar Hollywood faces.There's Charles Napier playing a corrupt to the bone CIA agent and playing it extremely well. Napier is known amongst hardcore film fans for often playing a hard ass with a load of jerk sprinkled on top. His role here is no exception. Obviously Napier himself isn't like that but somehow or another it just became a running thing for him in movies. Probably because he's so dam good at it. We also see Steven Berkoff, a very well known actor from such titles as A Clockwork Orange and Octopussy. But most notably to my mind, we see Martin Kove.While Kove has played many roles in his career, I love him best as the ruthless leader of the Cobra Kai Dojo in 1985's Karate Kid. That character has stuck in my mind for years and will probably never leave. Kove played it so ridiculously well that it almost made the character enviable even though he was one of the bad guys. If I were in a bad situation and I saw him in his Cobra Kai uniform, I'd be hiding behind him in a heartbeat...but back to First Blood II. Here he plays a mercenary, hired to get Rambo in and out of Vietnam and to back him up if Rambo runs into trouble. Kove's character however being a mercenary is only in it for the money. When the time comes to choose between saving Rambo and a rescued POW or following orders and abandoning them, he simply fly's away in his helicopter and leaves them to be captured by the enemy never even looking back. Fear not, he gets his later on in a most satisfying way and Kove even manages to play that moment out hilariously well.When I say this is more a pure action film than First Blood, don't get me wrong. It's a great movie and it has it's moments that are poignant and do bring back memories of the previous film. It's simply that there is a lot more action here. It makes sense however when you consider the situation or rather, the story of the film. There has to be more action when the main character is trapped behind enemy lines and facing off against countless Vietnamese soldiers backed by Russian military. If there wasn't more action, if it wasn't a tougher battle for Rambo, the movie would lose all credibility. As I've said though, First Blood II is still very well written, directed and edited. The location filming is excellent and the acting is spot on all around.If your looking for the poignancy of First Blood, I will say this. A few lines spoken by Rambo at the end of the film bring that rushing back and really hit you hard. Also, as with the first film this movie is well scored and has an excellent theme song called Peace In Our Life sung by none other than Frank Stallone, Sylvester Stallone's brother. It's not quite Dan Hill's ""It's a Long Road"" the theme from First Blood but Peace In Our Life is dam close to it in the way that both songs tug at your heart and your mind. Do yourself a favor, listen to the last few lines Rambo speaks in this movie and then just sit and let the credits roll while Peace In Our Life plays. It'll hit you where it counts, I promise you that.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
199,devinshee,The Movie That Started All the Typical Late 80's Action Movies,8,20 April 2008,"Rambo First Blood part 2 is pretty much the movie that started it all. And they also hardly make movies like this these days, but every once in a while they kind of do. Rambo 2 started all those typical late 80's action movies, mowing down 10 bad guys at once with a big machine gun, a lot of explosions, things blow up real good, everything in sight gets blown up, a lot of people get killed, blood, big macho muscle man stuff, the 80's music and feel, and the look. I think the late 80's and early 90's were the best years for action movies, and it kind of died down in 1995 and 96, but there were some good ones in those years too. I think Rambo 2 is pretty much the best Rambo movie in the franchise. Although i do like First Blood and Rambo 3 and the recent Rambo movie, but i think this one really shows Rambo's side of life. He is a Vietnam Veteran, and Col. Trautman send's him back to Vietnam to rescue American POW's. Rambo goes back to the war he once fought, and that's what originally created Rambo, the Vietnam War. First off, the action is pretty cool. A lot of stuff gets blown up, a lot of people get killed, bloody gunshot wounds, and some bloody moments, a guy gets blown up by an explosive bow and arrow. People get killed with bows and arrows. Rambo stealth kills people. And he battles the Vietnamese Troops, and the Russian Soviets. The Rambo movies are well known for the helicopters and stuff, so there is some helicopter action in this movie. I like the boat scene in the movie. I think this movie has one of the best turning points ever in a movie. I like it how Rambo gets captured by the Vietnamese and the Soviets. And he gets put into some sewage stuff, and gets a little roughed up, and he gets electrocuted, which is kind of a classic scene, and he gets that hot knife cut onto his face, and a POW is also used to get information out of Rambo. And then they force him to radio to his base to tell them to stop what they are doing or whatever. And then Rambo say's, ""Murdock, Im coming to get you!"". And then he starts kicking butt right after he say's that. So, as the movie goes on, he can kill as many people as he can, he can do no wrong after being tortured. You start to feel sorry for Rambo when he goes through an endless amount of torture, and i start to cheer for him when he escapes. That's a good turning point in a movie. I hate how his commander's said not to engage the enemy. And i really liked Charles Napier as one of Rambo Commanders, he was mean, double crossing Rambo and gets him captured, and not wanting POW's coming home. And Rambo finally comes back home with the POW's and teaches him a lesson. And it was nice to see that big Russian guy, and the main bad guy get killed too. I think that Vietnamese girl in the movie was pretty cute. The only thing i don't care so much about the movie, is that at times it kind of drags a little. Rambo 2 is very entertaining, and i think it is the best Rambo movie.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
200,masondbk-599-80448,Not Pro-War,8,5 August 2018,"Rambo first blood part 2 is the most iconic movie of the franchise and the most successful. The movie upon release was shunned by critics and star Sylvester Stallone alike the latter of whom went as far as saying this is the worst movie of the Rambo series. The film went on to win a Razzie for worst picture and to that I say... what are you talking about? it's true that the Rambo franchise went from being about how war destroys a person both physically and mentally and shows the horrors of combat and PTSD. This movie focuses around Rambo returning to Vietnam to save POW's which is in fact another horror of war. The movie doesn't promote war by showing Rambo kill around 74 people and use violence to solve his problems. It's just doing that to entertain the audience. For the most part the movie succeeds at being an entertaining flick. The villains this time have separate agendas. The main villain Podovsky is a Russian Colonel who works with the Vietcong to keep the POW's but the other main villain is actually the US army Marshall Murdock who sends Rambo on the mission hoping it would fail. The other reason i say this isn't a pro war film is that Murdock represents the Government who didn't care about the prisoners of war who were suffering for at least 17 years. This movie isn't pro-war or anti-war, the best way i can describe the film is anti-establishment since Rambo was betrayed by his government again. In the end Rambo states he wants the country to love him and the other veterans as much as they love him, is patriotic but it means more than what it sounds like. He was saying he acknowledges that Vietnam vets were scorned for the war and he wants them to be respected for their sacrifices. The only reason i'm only giving this an 8/10 is because Rambo went from a damaged individual suffering from severe PTSD to a stereotypical action hero in 3 years which pushes the suspension of disbelief too far. But the film is still a lot of fun and I would recommend it to any action fan.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
201,chainsmoker,Should have been more respectful of the original and the book,10,14 March 2001,"Rambo is definitely my most favorite movie character.  Ever since I was a kid, I wondered if a person like this really existed and if he did, what it would be like to meet him.  Rambo is the ultimate hero, someone we all look up to.  Here's a person who loves his country even though his country doesn't love him back.  He wants to win the war that was lost by double-crossing politicians.  He'll stop at nothing and is willing to die for it.  Unconditional love and loyalty.This movie could have used more of the novel it's based on.  I'm one of those folks who rush to the bookstore right after watching a movie.  One thing that puzzled me is that Rambo actually died in the first novel. Trautman shot him in the head.  The first book sucked big time.  Don't get me wrong, I like David Morrell.  They did such a great job on the script, it made me wish the book was just like the film.For those of you who are obtuse about the book, Rambo is a total psycho, Sheriff is a nice guy and Trautman is a cold-blooded professional.  No comradeship-in-arms, no male bonding, zilch.  You actually hate the protagonist more and more as you read about him slaughtering poor cops and at the end you're like, ""Yessss!""  By the way, Morrell never bothered to explain the death of his hero and just wrote another book. Hmmm...Anyway.  Rambo: First Blood Part II was an OK movie.  When I read the novel, it was awesome.  The movie would have been so much better if they had remained true to the book.  Oh well, Stallone himself wrote the script, what can you expect...  And did I see James Cameron's name somewhere in the writing credits?  Below are some things from the book that made me want to trash the movie.  Can't call them spoilers because they were never used in the film.Rambo's mother was an Indian from a reservation who married a violent Italian drunk.  Little Johnny ran away after nearly killing his father with an arrow; that's after dad had beaten his mother to death.  Trautman took him under his wing.  After escaping from a POW camp in Vietman the first time, Rambo, nearly dying, was found by a Buddhist monk.  He became a Zen Buddhist and his philosophy is described in detail in the book.  When Rambo is in jail after his rumble with police, Trautman comes to talk to him in his cell.  There's very emotional conversation.  Then they meet Murdock outside and many interesting facts about CIA frame-ups become known to us.The prisoner from the camp whom Rambo rescues actually has a name in the book and they talk about Star Wars.  The guy even flirts with the Vietnamese girl (who actually was married before and had a son in Huntington Beach, CA; her husband was a double agent, killed by the Commis.)  At the end, Murdock sends a chopper to intercept the one with the POWs and orders to take it down.  At the last second Trautman emerges in the back seat and sticks a gun in the pilot's ear.  Can anyone tell me why this great scene was not used in the movie?!?!?Anyway.  I forgot the point of my comment.  In short, it could have been a lot better, more like ""First Blood.""  If you watch two films right after another, you'll notice different atmosphere, characters we all know and love also act kind of strange...  A dull facsimile.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
202,JFHunt,I've seen this movie hundreds of times. It only gets better.,7,16 August 2008,"I actually had the pleasure to see this film in the theater on opening night. Granted I was only 6 years old at the time, but it's an experience I'll never forget.Something happened. It might have been the thunderous roar that came over the audience after the opening sequence. Maybe it was the cheering, the yelling, people going insane. Shook the whole damn place. Now I can't explain to you what actually happened, I wasn't born a poet, but it was just incredible. Something that I have yet to see happen again with any other movie. Something only a Rocky or Rambo picture could ever do. It made me a believer.One of my favorite scenes is when Stallone is slapped by one of the Vietnamese pirate's. ""He sold us outThe bastard."" Slap No reaction, just a look that could cut through steel. And that's what Rambo is all about. He is every man. Or what every man wants to be. Not simply a hero, but a winner.""Like you said Colonel, he went home."" This picture basically invented the action hero. Why do you think the 80's were filled with the blood and guts routine. Countless spin offs would try to recapture the glory. All but a few would fail. I've even seen movies with direct quote rip-offs that actually steal several direct lines from this movie.Is it Casablanca? No. Is it Apocalypse Now? No. Is it supposed to be? No. Stallone already made his miracle picture in 1976. It's called Rocky and it's one for the ages. Rambo: Does only one thing. Simply put, kick ass.",Rambo - First Blood Part II

I could be wrong, but it seems to be the ideal movie for any Vietnam vet looking for an outlet to his frustration.  The government used Rambo the way many soldiers must have felt used.

205,Diamond_Dog7,Great all-out Action,10,11 July 2011,"I don't really know why this is called First Blood: Part II, as it is vastly different to the original, but anyway, it's highly enjoyable.It picks up where the first film ends, with Rambo in prison. He is then paid a visit from Trautman, who briefs him about a new mission he has been hand picked to accomplish if he wishes. It involves rescuing American POW'S in Vietnam and will mean Rambo can get out of prison. Of course, he says ""yes"", and this how the film starts.In my opinion, I love this film. For me, it is one of the best action films of the 80's, if not of all time. It is all out action and explosions with a story you do kind of get into, but some may lose interest, but nonetheless, it is very highly enjoyable. Terrific genre defining film.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
206,blamar,What in the world were they thinking?,3,22 July 2006,"Okay, so the 80's were a different time. It was the era of Ronald Reagan, ultra conservative, and a nation trying to capture its past glory and making up for mistakes like Watergate and Vietnam. Rambo is a testosterone behemoth. He was imprisoned at the end of Rambo First Blood and now is working off his sentence in a Quarry Mine doing hard labour. He is given the opportunity to receive a presidential pardon if only he goes on a special mission to prove there are missing or captured soldiers from the Vietnam war. As usual the group of agents representing the world of technology, political correctness, and political expedience do not want any proof of Vietnamese conflicts, Rambo is basically sent on a mission to fail. Of course he doesn't and through a series of exploding boats, huts, and helicopters Rambo saves the day with an endless supply of arrows, bombs, and bullets. The biggest problem of Rambo is that it is so phony, so impossible and just so bad, that it becomes nothing more then a series of stale explosions and worse dialogue. Should you watch Rambo? Only if you have nothing else to do or taking a look at American Culture in the 1980's.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
207,janecamacho,Times do change!,1,9 May 2012,"Back in the days when I first saw this movie, Stallone's (and Schwarzenegger) movies appealed to me. Kick ass, shoot them full of holes kind of movie. But now, man, how times change. It's not worth all 90 minutes of it!Vietnam war vet John Rambo is set loose, after being captured in the first movie, with a mission for uncle Sam: finding POW's held by Vietnamese officials after the war in Vietnam ended. First Blood part 2 is a showcase for Stallone's one man army routine, which is pushed much further here then in the first movie (a different set piece let me tell you). You would've think that having James Cameron involved some how in the script (thats right!), at least could make the action scenes hook you in. Not the case! Aside from a helicopter dog fight in the end, the action sequences are repetitive, and cut very fast as to increase Rambo's body count. The script and its dialogs try to recapture the traumatized war vet that turns in to a fighting machine because he doesn't fit in society, but fails! Either the acting or the script are to blame for that, but since they are both credited to Stallone well, not even the POWs political implication holds water, and it had potential!To sum it up, not a movie worth seeing, even for nostalgia's sake. If you want nostalgia, or to reminisce on the old type action flicks then watch ""The expendables"" instead. It's a recent movie I know, but shows how Stallone, unlike this movie, got a little better with age. Rambo II ran its course with younger audiences, entering popular culture, but I guess we all have to grow up",Rambo - First Blood Part II

Later on, Rambo decides to take matters into his own hands and was betrayed by an American high official. Along with a beautiful Taiwan contact, Rambo fights the brutal Russians that sides with the Vietnamese and the Vietnamese themselves.

209,nik963,Great Entertainment,10,20 February 2008,"The average rating and cynical reviews on this film are just courtesy of people who can't enjoy an action movie. They have to analyse it's realism and mistakes. For those who say this movie is unrealistic and preposterous, well you are right but that's the point. John Rambo is unbeatable and some of the situations he gets out of are rather unrealistic, but to be perfectly honest, who cares?! This is an action picture, great fight scenes, tension and an incredible muscle bound hero who speaks little but does a lot. Stallone portrays the character well, Rambo has a sadness within him and the politics and repercussions of the Vietnam war are well documented within him and the movie. It doesn't wrap itself in the politics though. It just pans out as a brilliant action movie. It is hard to find a better 90 minutes of film to match the excitement of Rambo First Blood Part 2. In Part 1 it is more of a survivalist story whereas in Part 2 it is more action packed. The enemy is the Vietnamese and Russians while Rambo is a one man army. There are excellent chase scenes and the helicopter finale is outstanding.What I love about Rambo is he is not just a guy with a gun shooting anywhere, he is a proper hero. His use of arrows and his legendary knife plus his supreme strength and will power separate him from other action heroes. Definitely watch this film. You will not be disappointed.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
210,SpecialAgentMaxwell,RADICAL!!!,5,24 April 2002,"This is by far the greatest action movie that came out the week of May 25, 1985. I was literally blown away at Stallone's impressive performance as the stoic Rambo. In my mind, he is definitely NOT expendable. I also enjoyed the beautiful and talented Julia Nickson Soul as the never believable Vietnamese ally to Rambo. Her forced broken english was a film highlight. SPOILER ALERT! When her character dies in the movie, it is one of the most tragic death scenes in Hollywood history. Her death is such a blow to the movie audience because the filmmakers made a point to have us care so much about her character. As for Rambo, his constant internalized struggle is betrayed by Stallones beautifully subtexted performance. Never before has an actor delved so deep within a character and gave the audience such duality in a role. Or maybe...this just sucked.",Rambo - First Blood Part II

Wow, just wow. This film deconstructed is nothing but sheer class all the way. It has no weak or loose joints and the transitions are perfect. The pacing is flawless. The directing is very visual and creative. Now to mention the charisma and magnetism Stallone created with the character and the way he branded him was just amazing. Audiences in theaters actually standing up and cheering as one for the character as he spoke the ""Murdock... I'm coming to get you"" line. When was the last time that happened in the cinema? The film remains a wonderful example of what the human spirit can achieve if people work as a team. This is not only a testament of a mesmerizing movie, but a symbol of how wonderful art can be when artists all contribute their heart to a project. This film is nothing short of a perfect picture and I quote the back of the original 1985 video release ""One of the greatest films you could ever hope to take home with you"" If anyone sees any faults with the film, I'd certainly like to hear from you. But in 20 years time, the 80's will be praised for their superb art and this film will become one of the greatest cult classics ever.

But it was taken seriously my many people, especially overseas. Silly as it sounds, wherever I went in Europe in the late 80's people seemed to judge me and Americans in general by this film. Unrealistic? Hmm, let's see. A monosyllabic, muscle-bound cretin is pulled off a prison work gang to go on a secret mission to SE Asia to free some American POW's. In a running battle he kills about 500 enemy soldiers with an M-60 machine gun that never runs out of ammo and never overheats. And he never misses, running with a 32lb gun held up with one arm.

But there's been a lot of nasty reviews from people who have a terrible problem with the action scenes in this film.First of all, the reason Rambo killed so many of the Soviets and the Viet Cong is because they were trying to kill him. Anybody who sees the Viet Cong and the Soviets as ""victims"" definitely needs a history lesson. Didn't the Soviets routinely imprison and murder dissenters? The Soviets were no different from the Nazis.And second, this movie is supposed to be fiction. It's very illogical to show one man destroying an entire army single-handedly, but Rambo has an excessive amount of military experience, which is one part of the plot that you missed.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
215,egriffith-2,Patriotic and fun,7,10 October 2020,"Since First Blood, Rambo's 2nd film takes him to even more superhuman levels. First Blood Part II is colorful and flamboyant, but equally entertaining. His accomplishments are comic and fantastic. Even with it's lack of realism the film's charm endures. It's a movie with heart that even it's cheese will inspire cheers. Additionally, it addresses some worthwhile issues. Worth the 2 hours.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
216,Hamza21,1/6 of the movie is pretty entertaining.,6,14 October 2008,"When people think of Rambo and all that he represents, they're actually thinking of First Blood Part II (and Rambo III), replaced by a more escapist-oriented tone and approach. Virtually absent from this film is the ""realism"" of the first picture. Through and through, Rambo is nothing more than a full-blooded action film and because it's more forthcoming with its modest aspirations, it makes for better and more consistent entertainment than its predecessor. That still doesn't say much. After the events of the first film, John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is still serving time in a prison, but is given the opportunity for a pardon of all wrongdoings if he participates in a top-secret operation. Informed of the plan briefly after his release, he will parachute into Vietnam to search for evidence of American POWs in a specific prison camp. He's not to engage in combat, only to take photos. Teamed up with Co Bao (Julia Nickson), a Vietnamese freedom fighter, he sets out to free all the prisoners, even against the orders of his superiors. Anyone looking for entertainment value based on plot and characters will be sorely disappointed. Both aspects are where the movie's flaws lie. Generally, the story just isn't that interesting, usually serving to drag the picture down rather than giving it a boost in between the action scenes. Stallone still makes for an effective Rambo, this time elevating his character to genuine action hero status. The human qualities he displayed in the first film are still evident, mixing in nicely with his outlandish heroics. But it's virtually everyone else who's subpar. As the love interest, Julia Nickson was chosen for her appearance (and yes, she's very beautiful), but this isn't a role that does her any favors. Not only is the actress obviously half-caucasian, to give her the flavor of a Vietnamese woman, she speaks broken English, meaning she says lines like ""You not expendable,"" basically leaving a word or two out of each sentence. But her pronunciation of each word is so precise and without a hint of an accent, it's so obvious she's actually fluent in English. Why didn't the filmmakers just let her play her character as such? Aside from Richard Crenna, all the supporting players, whether on the American, Vietnamese, or Russian side, are all one-dimensional caricatures. As service to a mindless action film, that's not necessarily a bad thing, but knowing where all the characters stand from their very first appearance (even the so-called traitors are easy to point out) makes for less interesting viewing. When the action is on-screen, FBII is sometimes a good slice of thrilling escapism. The first hour is completely dull, none of the shootouts or fights are directed with much flair or energy, but the last fifteen minutes are actually a pretty jolly good time, with Rambo taking on both the Russian and Vietnamese armies. Standout action scenes include the fight aboard the Russian chopper, the destruction of the prison camp, and the climactic helicopter chase, one of the series' most exhilarating action setpieces (nice to see the movie end on a very high note). The film is nicely backed by Jerry Goldsmith's rousing score, one of the famed composer's best works. Released the same year as that other one-man army flick, Arnold Scwarzenegger's Commando, FBII is superior in many ways. The action choreography is slicker and arguably on a larger scale, the cinematography and direction is overall crisper, and Goldsmith's score is far more effective than James Horner's. But in the end, Commando is the far more entertaining picture because it maintains a fast pace and a great sense of macho fun from the first minute to the last. That, and a good sense of humor, is what elevates that film to the top of its kind.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
217,bobhelms,A Great Action Flick In The 80's Action Genre Mold,8,17 September 2017,"I as a little young when I first saw this, and the First Blood movie I didn't see till a few years after this, so I didn't go in with any idea about who Rambo was or what he was about. Stallone does so well as a brooding action star, always on the edge of sanity in so many of his movies. This movie came out and mixed the current (at that time) hatred for the Soviets, with the bad taste of unfinished business within Vietnam, as many people believed (and it may have been true) that there were American POW's somewhere over there that were left behind by a government that ""just didn't care and wanted it all to go away"".It fills all of the typical 80's action film clichés: never ending ammo, completely unrealistic gun fights where the good guy can't be hit by any rounds, while he fires wildly with two M-60's and hits everything that moves. But, who ever asked for realism, it's a work of feel good fiction anyway, right? Rambo gets beat up throughout the movie, then comes back in the end and rains vengeance upon the bad guys. Comes back, confronts the bad government guy and his lackeys, roll credits.When I rate a movie like this, I'll rate it with an idea of what was out there at that time. Very few movies stand the test of time, like The Godfather, or 2001, or The Good The Bad The Ugly. Most movies you enjoy, when it starts getting into 10 or more years since you've seen them, you wax poetic about them and perhaps remember them more fondly. This isn't really an exception to that. The Senator in the movie comes off as too much of a representation of a government that many people hated (and still do), but he does a good job of it. Richard Crenna as Col. Trautman is probably the best acting done by anyone in the movie.The unfortunate part of a movie like this is all of the bad reviews it will get from people who want to make a fictional movie into something political. If you find the movie to be atrocious and give it one star on the basis of bad acting, or poor plot, or over the top lack of realism, so be it. But the reviews going on and on about ""bad bad USA, should not have been in Vietnam"" or ""xenophobic"" or ""racist"", please, you need to read up about a few of the POW camps over there that were far far worse than what is shown in the movie. And even more silly: questions like ""how would Americans feel if Germany had made a film like this rescuing Nazis"" Uh, the Germans did, many countries make what can be construed as ""anti-american movies"", but we don't hear much about it here.But, I digress, enough with my annoyance about politically motivated reviews. If you enjoy Stallone's dark attitude and cliché catch phrases, combined with gratuitous meaningless hail of bullets and knife jabs, you'll enjoy this movie.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
218,FlatSixMan,Jerry Goldsmith excels where most else fails.,6,3 August 2010,"Rambo: First Blood Part II; Directed by: George P. Cosmatos; Starring: Sylvester Stallone, Richard Crenna, Charles Napier, Steven Berkoff et al.This is the kind of film I watch when I want a straightforward action film: one invincible hero and a lot of very bad 'bad guys' who are just waiting to get killed. Sylvester Stallone is John Rambo, our invincible hero who wants his country to love him and calls war his home. But let's forget Stallone's serious intentions with this film for a while and just focus on the incredible fun this film delivers in the action department. If you want action, you need villains, and the film offers some good ones. There are a great many Vietnamese soldiers, but let's not forget the number one enemy: the Communists. In short: ""Rambo: First Blood Part II"" delivers a lot of action, a lot of laughs and somewhere amongst the dead bodies lies its message. Before I go into a more detailed analysis, let me sketch you the film's story.The film opens in an American labor camp, located somewhere on the globe, where Rambo is working out the sentence he got after the first film. Colonel Trautman (Crenna) can get him out if he goes back to Vietnam to find some P.O.W.'s. He agrees to do so, naturally, but when he' on his way to the camp the American government once again lets him down, betrays him and thus leaving him on his own amongst the evil forces. He's captured by the Vietnamese, who are aided by Russian colonel Podovsky (Berkoff, who previously acted as the villain in ""Octopussy"" and ""Beverly Hills Cop""), who is very, very evil. After being electrocuted as a means of torture by a big Russian bad guy, Rambo escapes with the aid of his female ally Co (Julia Nickson), who happens to be in love with him. Incredible enough the story has room for a romantic scene between the two of them. She seems to be the only one who thinks Rambo isn't expandable, except colonel Trautman, Rambo's faithful commander. Murdock (Napier), the American in charge of the operation and responsible for betraying him, is now Rambo's primary target, but first Rambo has to deal with an entire camp of Vietnamese soldiers and a Russian attack force. Rambo naturally has no trouble at all killing every single one of them, be it with bullets, arrows, explosive arrows, knifes, or his muscular body. He also manages to save the P.O.W.'s along the way: mission accomplished. Murdock isn't very happy with this, since there are no more obstacles between him and Rambo's revenge, but luckily Rambo isn't the worst guy to be around with.This very sophisticated story is filmed competently by George P. Cosmatos, who handles large action set pieces while also providing some nice scenery shots. What really makes this film so much fun to watch is something else though. This film wouldn't be the 80's action 'masterpiece' it is without Jerry Goldsmith's magnificent score. His synthesizers never sounded this cool and he wields his orchestra with so much thrust that the score seems to drive the action and the visuals, instead of the other way round. Goldsmith understood the incredible cheesiness of the film and scored it accordingly, with a deliciously over the top action score. Its incredibly heroic theme makes the action seem like a ballet and the 'tender' scenes between Rambo and his female companion are scored gorgeously dramatic. Dominating all of this are Goldsmith's ferocious synthesizers, with a dominating sort of chainsaw sound, which is just too cool for words. This is truly a masterpiece amongst action scores and perhaps the most energetic score ever. Without its score the film would be utterly pathetic, with it, it almost becomes a great film. Almost for even a great score can't save a fundamentally bad film. As I see it the key to enjoying this film lies with your intentions towards it. If you watch this film with the intention of having a fun time, enjoying the indestructibility of John Rambo and the ease with which he kills off dozens of bad guys, you'll be thoroughly entertained. Ironically though, Stallone thought this film was a very serious endeavor and that Rambo was a very serious acting job. I wouldn't be surprised if he believed he could get an Oscar for it. If you watch the film like Stallone intended, you'll see this film for the failed attempt at serious filmmaking it is. There is a message, but it lies somewhere between the dead bodies on the battlefield, as a casualty of war. That is, it could be that the film's message is one that's close to your heart (which it isn't to mine), but it is still out of place in this film. It remains a failure in many parts, but what it does bring is tremendous fun, hence my positive rating of 6 / 10 for this film.",Rambo - First Blood Part II

He is a one of a kind hero. The man every other man should aspire to be. I suspect that people who award this film with two stars have failed in this regard and are taking out their insecurities on this superior slice of cinema. With this film Stallone created a trend-setting genre masterpiece. It was ALIENS before ALIENS - a sequel that upped the ante on the sparse original and brought all-out war to the table. It is also the film that is definitive proof that Sly was the victor over Arnie in the battle of the 80s action hero. If not for RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD PART II Schwarzenegger probably would not have had two of his biggest action hits - COMMANDO and PREDATOR - as both borrow heavily from this film (neither are as good).

220,jonasskjoett,Rumble In the Jungle!,7,13 September 2010,"'Rambo: First Blood Part II' is the pure essences of real eighties excitement (done the Rambo way)... because this movie is nothing like 'Platoon' or 'Deer Hunter', this is 100% pure man action! The story is simple, just hear... Trautman visits Rambo at a labor camp prison, and offers him the chance of freedom after what he did in 'First Blood', but only if he goes to Vietnam, and search the jungle for some missing American prisoner of war. Isn't that just a plot every person can understand, and for a action movie like this, it couldn't fit any better.Just so anybody know, the main thing in this movie is the action and nothing more than that, and what I know about action, is that real men cry blood, when they see those beautiful explosions, and a man killing a whole army, in a war there is nowhere near realistic... but men like me, don't give a ****, we just sit back and enjoy the spectacle of the expendable Rambo.Top 3 Favorites - 80's Action Movies: #3 Rambo: First Blood Part II #2 Predator #1 Die Hard...",Rambo - First Blood Part II

This is a typical 80s movie where you have one man destroying the whole army by himself. ""First Blood Pt. 2"" is very similar to Schwarzenegger's ""Commando"", but there you have Arnold killing the terrorist while here you have a specific nation showed as the bad guys. This movie is a typical American anti-Soviet propaganda. True, this was the peak of the Cold War, but I'm sick of having Communists or the Nazis always being shown as the enemy. There are so many American movies that have this one thing in common. Why can't there a movie that show Americans as the enemy? Who's going to believe that one lone soldier will destroy the whole army? Do you really think that something like this would have really happened?

222,Brooks5-1,"""To survive a war, you have to become war...""",8,9 October 2008,"Rambo II is one of those movies that in a way surpass its predecessor. It's more action oriented but with a somewhat cool plot. The movie itself is one of the most definitive action movies of the 80's. Directed by Italian director, George Cosmatos, the movie was the one who put the name ""Rambo"" in common use in the USA. Also it was written by James Cameron (of the ""Terminator"" saga and Titanic) and Sylvester Stallone. The hidden subject in this movie is actually the idea of Rambo ""winning"" the Vietnam war but there is more to it. When this movie opened in 85, the Cold War was as its best. Reagan used this movie to put himself into the ""rambomania"" frenzy, we all know that Reagan use all the media at his disposal but that's another story whatsoever. The movie is rated R for violence mostly, there are a couple of bad words and blood but teens can get to it without much trouble. The whole idea of the ""expendable"" issue is a good theme for discussion between parents and kids or teacher and students. Rambo: First Blood Part II (in some countries called ""Rambo II: The Mission) now in this DVD format is a definitive movie for the action fan, specially if you are a fan of the 80's movie. This edition has clear image and excellent sound. The process for digitalization of the picture was done perfectly so you won't believe you are actually watching a movie almost 20 years old. The documentary has a lot of cool info, even for those ""Rambomania"" fans would find this very interesting and with interviews with cast and crew including Stallone, the late Richard Crenna, and others. Also the director Cosmatos and the producers get into the documentary with interesting facts (the idea of pairing Stallone and Travolta as a sidekick was a novelty for me!!!) is a good source for inside info. The trailers (some are TV spots) are also quite good but they haven't been ""cleaned up"" so they look like they are quite old and the sound in those is not remastered. There's also a section on the stars and the crew with filmography and stuff it's informative but that's it. The extras are good. It would be fun if they throw a lot of deleted scenes into it, but there isn't. The audio commentary of Cosmatos is so-so there aren't much there either. Finally I must say this edition contain both the widescreen version and the full screen version so you can go wrong there. The movie comes with subtitles in Spanish for both versions.

225,Whackooyzero,A classic in it's genre that will unfortunately never get the proper credit.,10,27 August 2010,"I am willing to say that Rambo II is equal to First Blood and both are Stallone's best movies(and this is coming from a HUGE Stallone fan). This movie is pretty much as good as action/war movies from the 1980's get and unfortunately, due to most people's inability to put aside their modern day political eye glasses for pure entertainment and because of the numerous spoof and parodies of this particular movie(and I suppose all the pointless merchandising at the time doesn't exactly help either) it will probably never be acknowledged as such.However, I'm here to set the record straight. The story is simple, John Rambo after having spent time in prison after the events of the magnificent ""First Blood"", is brought back into battle by his friend and Colonel Sam Trautman. Rambo is sent to investigate the possibility of hidden POW's still held in Vietnam. And right there you see why people are so negative towards this movie. Look people, the setup is only there to create the adventure, now if you were able to accept it as that you would find this movie to be one of the better paced, better executed and to a certain degree better acted than most movies in this genre.One of the things Rambo II has that almost no one mentions is that it does contain dramatic elements especially the relationship between Stallone and Julia Nickson as Co Bao the Asian freedom fighter and with the character who goes by the name of Murdock. which is something that would be unfortunately left out in ""Rambo III"". But what this movie delivers in(and in my opinion in a fashion and way just as classic and unique as Raiders Of The Lost Ark was a few years earlier) is keeping the audience focused the whole time following Rambo's journey and of course cheering at the non stop action found in it.That's probably another element that turns people off. This movie has so much machine gun fire and frantic action scenes that some might see it as mindless macho crap(probably not helped by the fact Stallone spends the last third or so of the movie shirtless) but frankly all the action scenes are invigorating and well filmed. If you don't like it fair enough but it's still obvious a lot of effort was put into it. Yes some of the action scenes do defy logic but that really doesn't matter because we like the characters enough at the end of the movie to ignore such flaws.Everything about the execution of this movie is classic and in some ways the movie is, despite what some might say, exactly that. This movie defined what a cheesy 1980's action movie should be but in this case still managed to have a story with actual human interest in it(something Stallone frequently does in his films from Rocky to First Blood to Lock Up to F.I.S.T) even if it is an admittedly very simple(but very effective) story.There is a message to the movie but I don't think it's the one a lot of people seem to think it is. I feel the movie's message is more geared towards Murdock and how he betrays Rambo than it is geared towards the Vietnamese and the Russians. The message I see is in many ways what Rambo says at the end of the movie which is that showing mercy for those who go into danger and leaving none behind is what should always be emphasized not only in war but in life, with the people who depend on you. because they wouldn't do what they do if they didn't believe in themselves and that is to be admired. At least that's the way I interpret it.But that's just if you really look, what the movie really is is the epitome of visceral entertainment filled with heroism, justice and energy. Filmed great, told in a strong way, acted convincingly, Rambo: First Blood Part II is a classic in it's genre and deserves better then what it's gotten from a lot of people.",Rambo - First Blood Part II

Let's just quickly look at the title of this film. It is all over the place, not making sense. The first blood was drawn in the last film. For the title of ""First Blood Part II"" to be logical, it would have to be drawn by the same person, again, before anyone else. But much like the 80's the decade this film was made, nothing makes any sense at all. Hair is big. Men have no chest hair. Asians speak with American/broken English. And no one's shirt fits right.Directed by Goerge P. Cosmatos, the second instalment in the Rambo series was written by Sylvester Stallone, James Cameron (first draft) and Kevin Jarre. Rambo FBP2 stars Sylvester Stallone as Rambo, and Martin Kove, Julia Nickson, Steven Berkoff, Charles Napier, with Richard Crenna.The story picks up sometime after Vietnam war, and Rambo is serving time in a labour camp when he gets a visit from Colonel Trautman. Trautman offers Rambo a chance at full clemency in return for a secret mission. Rambo is tasked with going back into Vietnam to find POWs. His mission is to simply photograph there prisoners, if there are any, and to not engage anyone in battle. But in usual Rambo style, everything goes wrong and he must kick-ass and blow the joint up. After a predictable swerve, Rambo must fight off the enemy alone, while plotting his revenge against the main-hand that sent him into a political hush-hush, propaganda mission.WHAT WORKED:The action. Like the 80's. It's big. It's loud. It's doing cocaine off of a black toilet in the back of a shady club!Stallone. He's pretty much the only actor who did his job in this thing. Few lines, big muscles, foot firmly up bad-guy ass.WHAT DIDN'T WORK:The score. There was some choice music during that didn't fit many scenes. Bouncy music isn't the best idea for a dark torture scene.The cleanliness level of Julia Nickson. She's in the jungles of Vietnam where every man she interacts with is filthy with sweat, blood, dirt and 80's, yet she's always prim and properly dry. WTF?THE LOWDOWN:This movie makes the full circle from suck to success. Everyone is a flat character. No one has a change or even a revelation. It's big. It's loud. It's simple. It does try to make a commentary on the Vietnam war and the American Government's involvement/propaganda, but comes off slightly cheesy because of it.

232,bonzojade,It delivers and what it delivers is damn good.,10,31 October 2014,"Rambo II is excellent. Great cinematography and while unrealistic shows real ideals. First off, people complain how over the top it is; so what? The first wasn't as realistic as you paint it. One man doing that to a whole town? No. But because it's message was so important no one cared. This one too has an important message. But it's up to you to find it. If you can see past the violence. Jerry Goldsmith is a musical genius. His work is pure brilliance. The music speaks volumes and is emotional. I love when the instrumental of ""It's a Long Road"" swells up, it makes your heart soar or clench depending on the scene at the time.Stallone is my favourite actors, I have seen 33/56 of his films and I don't intend to stop. All this and I'm not even seventeen. His films are always worth a watch; either for the message or for a laugh.",Rambo - First Blood Part II

235,thorpeg1984,The Pioneer !! Mother of all action movies !!,10,26 October 2013,"This movie pioneered a genre, the action genre !! People who bash this movie forget that movie making is not just an art of making cinema that is limited to certain parameters, these people often don't think beyond few boundaries and consider themselves to have brains, BULLSHIT !! This movie tarted the action genre, there are many mindless sequences here but come on, no matter how much you try to forget it but the fact is you are watching a MOVIE, a movie is unreal !! Its not real life !! If people get to see what they want to see in an over the top way for 90 minutes & enjoy these 90 minutes, there's nothing bad in that. The movies was a blockbuster worldwide and the world loved it. Rambo was a phenomenon, every action made after First Blood part-II borrows something or the other from this movie and still some 'critics' say the movie was dumb, they themselves are dumb because they can't think beyond the boundaries...movie making is imagination! Sylvester Stallone unfortunately gets the bashing of critics as he can't deliver dialogues, can't speak properly, but what would you expect out of a guy who has a paralysed face & slurred speech, give the credit to the guy who despite the odds is a winner. He is a great physical actor and an icon worldwide. This movie started the trend for a worldwide audience for Hollywood, come on this movie was a great ENTERTAINER !! Give it some credit !!",Rambo - First Blood Part II
236,beatles1082,Great Action,8,2 December 2006,"I still think that First Blood was the best of the Rambo movies but this movie is better as a great action film. There are many classic moments in this movie that made Rambo an essential character in the history of action films. Not many people would say that the Rambo movies are the best action movies ever, but many will remember Rambo as one of the best action movie characters ever. All I have to say is that the best scene in this movie is in the beginning when Rambo is loading up all him ammo, including pistols,machine guns, and arrows with explosive tips. The funny part of this is that the director throws the Camera being loaded into all the other weapons being loaded; it makes me laugh every time. Great action film.",Rambo - First Blood Part II

All time top 10 for me,10,21 August 2019,When you watch first blood you get a great film that gives the backdrop to what is one of the best box sets for the diehard action fan.

240,sand_man002,Action classic.,8,16 October 2008,"Rambo 2 is the most underrated action classic ever made. Sure the acting is pretty bad but I don't they really wanted to focus on it when they were filming. The director wanted an action movie not a really dramatic action movie sort of like First Blood. He achieved the action side of things with the last half hour being truly heart pounding (the scene where Rambo blows up the whole enemy camp with his explosive bow and arrow, also the part where he jumps out of the mud wall). Sylvester Stallone put on a good performance in First Blood but part two was all about action entertainment.The budget really helped the movie with the key action scenes showing fantastic real explosions which must of cost more than the whole first movie's budget combined. What also makes the last scenes of the movie better besides the action is that the horrible actress is killed off, the Asian lady. Every time I hear her say ""You made it Rambo!"" I try to push it to the back of my mind and enjoy the action. The musical score was what we need from an action movie which is to make the main character cool, and it did. Overall this average movie is saved by the action in my opinion, and when I say saved I mean total redemption. All action movie purists should love this movie.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
241,unamico,It is the HEART,10,7 April 2008,"I'm a little surprised MOST people call this film a mindless one. Really mindless? Not at all.This movie is not about showing how intelligent the plot should have been, it is not about the mind. Instead, it is about the heart. The heart of a great soldier, who loves his country, yet the country abandons him. Rambo shows great honor and heart, willing to die to save those POW no one dares to save. This is humane.All in all, the key here is HEART, or some people call it passion, not the mind. It doesn't matter if you have the so-called great mind, like those so-called ""great clever minds"" who abandon their own men and called them ghosts in the movie. What is important is the heart. Only those who really have heart can feel the movie deeply. President Reegan once complimenting the movie has it too. People with great mind but no heart will never understand, even if they are smart.Heart.Do you have it? Do you feel it? Are you willing to put aside your mind which you always think is so important? Do you feel it instead of think it? It's up to you now...",Rambo - First Blood Part II

244,md119,Stupid propaganda of the worst kind,1,8 September 2012,"In 1985 when this action movie was released, it must have looked state of the art in terms of special effects. Also, it was released at the peak of the cold war which spawned other nonsense movies like Red Dawn and Missing in Action. Almost 30 years on, the action sequences still look OK but to watch the movie is just painful. The story is dumb and lame. Sly Stallone is even worse than usual. Even the most patriotic American must feel embarrassed to watch this. After Rambo released the POWs from Vietnam all by himself against a bunch of one- dimensional Russians, he would return in 1987 to single-handedly kick the Russians out of Afghanistan. That one was even worse. I still enjoy watching cheesy 80s movies. However, this one I did not like back then and I hate it even more now.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
245,Fdomorillo,About RAMBO IV,10,31 May 2005,"Here recently more than one week in the Local newspaper of my city, in Léon, Guanajuato, Mexico. A news article in the World of the Spectacle was published about Silvester Stallone. Referring to the production and Shooting of RAMBO IV. I Saw, the commentaries about the histories and script absolutely I did not like, because I believe that these characters who the actor represents can give much more... Would be possible that somebody interview to him? Or that somebody commented to him of this matter! That its decision To film more, is correct, but mistaken in the performance of the characters with that history that will take I finish! Including the express newspaper, the discord or refusal of histories on the part of the American hearing. Like for example: Rambo has a daughter and it faces gangster. I consider that WITH the SUBJECT: OF THE TERRORISM. Rambo have much more potential, and a new enemy to whom to face, more than simple gangsters, and to sink of the ""MANDIL"" of Father, already who RAMBO CHARACTERIZES BEING; He is a ""HEROE OF WAR"". He fights by his country and causes that for the rest of the world in order to stop they are unjust... Perhaps I do not know, I think that to retake some characters, it would be better than to do it as they plan it To film. For example: ""The Kid"" and the ""Warrior of Mujahedeen rebels"" of film RAMBO III in AFGANISTAN would be a good point, locating them in the other Side of the ""Bad Boys"" like a AL QUAEDA Organization, that seeing prepare the breakfast for her daughter, in the mentioned future production... And by such reason I consider that it is obvious that it is going to be Failure and a waste in Investment of million dollars... THANKS FOR READ MY COMMENTS!",Rambo - First Blood Part II

Does it get a little unreal? Duh! It's a movie which can be allowed to do so. The action is great and that's all it's meant to do. It's not as great as the first but it does enough to make a decent sequel when so many movies back then would screw it up.It's probably a solid 7 in my books, but a 10 it gets to counter the people who somehow gave it a 1.

251,goodfrosty21,Rambo is....unleashed?,9,18 November 2006,"I think I've watched First Blood about 4 times over the years, not a whole lot, but its an interesting movie, even though it lacks violence, the story, plot, acting, setting, and directing all form a great film.First Blood Pt. II, however, skips some of the story/plot/acting part. Even skips on some ""realistic"" parts.I do like this movie, but sometimes, it just dosn't even feel like a sequel to first blood. Sure, RAMBO IS UNLEASHED in the environment he does best in, but that dosn't explain why he sometimes just goes crazy,in the stereotyped ""Rambo"" way. Sure, hes a Green Beret, but he dosn't act it sometimes,makes a lot of noise usually,and just acts kind of ""off"" sometimes, and goes way ""over the top"".But it is an action film, not a drama, and its not Apocalypse Now either.Its John Rambo, turned loose in his environment, fighting for his ""people"" (POW's like he was), but only cut and dumbed down from First Blood, and directed in an ""Action"" manner.The film does have some good moments, and some bad ones. The montage of Rambo disposing of Russian soldiers in the jungle was interesting, the helicopter chase scene (With...a Hind D?) was pretty good, but how does Rambo know how to pilot a Russian helicopter? Why is it equipped with a M60, and a lot of western munitions? Its possible, that Rambo could have been familiarized with the controls...yes, but it still dosn't explain the weaponry. Anyway, it does end with an interesting ""quick-draw"" duel. But, like its been said, a LAW rocket does like to melt whatever is behind it. An RPG, even though it also likes to shoot some hot exhaust out the back, wouldn't have been as bad, and would have made sense that it was actually in a ""Russian"" piece of equipment.Anyway, story is pretty good, not much character, but Rambo dosn't say all that much anyway, and he does have a few parts were he speaks, some. But if both ""First Bloods"" were stuck together, back to back, even though it would be around the length of Apocalypse Now: Redux, you might actually understand Rambo's character, which you don't get to in this one, much, other than he is a former POW, Vietnam Vet, and he gets to go back to 'nam, on a mission to free himself, or just to fight, its not really explained.But, if you watched both ""Blood"" movies, you migth understand that Rambo, came home, was misjudged, and felt out of place. He was also deeply disturbed by his former ""POW"" situation. Vietnam pretty much took a lot out of him.So a chance to go back, and free people like himself from Vietnam would be interesting, right? Especially since hes stuck, in a prison.This is the main problem with people who just watched First Blood II, they assume Rambo is just some generic action star, who just goes around blowing stuff all to hell, for no reason really, which, if you got any kind of back-story, he'd have some reason to do this, being a former POW and having nothing to lose.The movie is still kind of ""Heroic"" if you put it like that, Rambo is not made out as an ""Anti-Hero"" or anything like that, or just being in combat because he enjoys it (which, is kind of hinted at in First Blood, he explains that all he could do was fight, and that he can't do anything else, even work at a car-wash) Or even a combination of the two into a ""I have nothing to lose and I'm going to free men like myself"" instead, its kinda ruined by the ""Anti-Red"" mentality, and becomes more about fighting them, than trying to free the POWS sometimes.The speech at the end kind of goes along with that, where Rambo explains that he would like for his country to care as much about him, as he does about it, which, dosn't really make any sense. If you believe that Rambo was just a ""fighter"" and didn't want others being POWS.Is he fighting for his country, himself, or the POWS? Who knows, and this film was slightly over done with the ""Anti-Communism"" heroism.Still, a good action movie, and really the only good sequel to the first film, its easier to get into and understand because of its mostly ""straight forward"" vengeance mission that Rambo goes on, but not as interesting as the original, were Rambo was more controlled (both in character, story, and directing) than being ""unleased"" in the Sequel.",Rambo - First Blood Part II

I don't understand the low ratings this film gets,people say 'I switched off when the chopper refuses to pick up Rambo and the POW' well,if thats the case youv'e just missed the whole point of the film,the government knew where POW's were being held,but didn't want to go get them as they had known for years,but wanted to be seen as doing something to find them,which is why they sent Rambo in to 'take pictures' but they sent him purposely so he wouldn't find them (because they didn't think there were any there at all)So when they saw him with one,they refused to take him as they would be shamed for not getting them sooner. So Rambo in typical style decides he is going to get them on his own,and does so in spectacular style as a one man army taking all the vietnamese and russians with him. Epic Film,if you did turn off then shame on you and youv'e missed one of the best films of the 80's.",Rambo - First Blood Part II
