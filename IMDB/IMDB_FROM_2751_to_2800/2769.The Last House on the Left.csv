0,Leofwine_draca,One viewing is enough,4,16 August 2016,"Wes Craven's first film is without a doubt one of the most brutal, intense and shocking movies you'll ever see. Before our eyes a catalogue of atrocities are carried out through the grainy eye of the unblinking camera. To make matters worse, Craven makes us get to know and care about the characters before the violence begins, which of course makes the eventual bloodshed all the more worse. Indeed this film made me queasy while watching, and it's not an easy film to sit through. It might be a good film, yes, but its definitely not enjoyable. Would you want to watch it again? I don't think so.The film's low budget merely adds to the overall gritty feel of it. The only thing out of place is the inappropriate cheerful music which keeps popping up all of the time, we could have done without this. All characters are three-dimensional and understandable, even the psychopaths. Yes, they're psychopaths, but these people could be real, such things really do happen in real life. David Hess went on to carve himself a niche in these type of roles, as to portray a cold-blooded sadist was something he did with frightening realism. Cassel and Grantham are likable and heart-breaking as the subjects of the violent attacks, scenes hard to watch. Everybody in this film puts their heart into it.Craven even experiments with manipulation of the viewer, in the final scenes getting us to cheer on a chainsaw murderer. The film questions violence and the primitive way in which it is a part of human nature. I wouldn't really recommend this film, see it if you have to. One viewing is way more than enough though.",The Last House on the Left
1,SnoopyStyle,some good exploitation scenes but generally amateurish and silly,5,22 September 2015,"It's Mari Collingwood's 17th birthday. She and her friend Phyllis Stone go to NYC for a concert. They try to buy some weed but are kidnapped and raped by a gang of criminals. They are stuff in the car trunk and driven to the woods near Mari's home. The girls are tortured and killed. The gang ends up coincidentally at the Collingwood home while the bumbling local cops struggle to track the gang down.This is definitely an exploitation film. I'm sure it was derided by the critics at the time. Some of those exploitation parts are actually the best parts of the movie. Being forced to pee in her pants is a compelling scene. The rest of the movie is amateurish, silly and simply bad. The comic stuff with the cops is groan-worthy. The coincidence of running into the Collingwood home is ridiculous and unnecessary. The gang could have gotten the address from Mari. The overall need to create a peaceful happy tone while counteracting it with the brutal violence does not come off well. Then there is the killing of the girls which splits the movie in two. The second half fades and the intensity never fully recovers. It's one of Wes Craven's first and it's at the level of a good student film.",The Last House on the Left
2,claudio_carvalho,A Raw Low Budget Movie,6,1 November 2009,"On the eve of her seventeenth birthday, Mari Collingwood (Sandra Cassel) tells her parents that she is going to the concert of underground band Bloodlust in New York with her friend Phyllis Stone (Lucy Grantham). She borrows the family's car and heads with her friend to a dangerous neighborhood in the city. Meanwhile, the sadistic and cruel escapees Krug Stillo (David A. Hess) and Fred 'Weasel' Podowski (Fred Lincoln) are hidden in a hideout with their partners Sadie (Jeramie Rain) and Krug's addicted son Junior Stillo (Marc Sheffler) after killing two guards and one shepherd in their runaway. The two girls seek marijuana near the theater and meet Junior that offers some Colombian grass to them. They go to his apartment and are subdued by the criminals that rape Phyllis. On the next morning, they hide the girls in the trunk of their convertible and head to Canada. However, they have a problem with the car's rod and they stop on the road close to Mari's house. When Phyllis tries to escape, the gang stabs her to death and shots Mari after humiliating and raping them. They seek shelter in Mari's home, but during the night, her mother overhears a conversation of the criminals telling that they have killed her daughter. She tells her husband and they plot a scheme to revenge the death of their princess.A couple of days ago I saw the 2009 remake of ""The Last House on the Left"" and I decided to see the original 1972 version, which is a raw low budget movie based on the storyline of 1960 Ingmar Bergman's ""Jungfrukällan"". The 1972 movie has a more realistic and simple story and the weakest part are the two clumsy redneck policemen that are ridiculous and never funny. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Aniversário Macabro"" (""Macabre Birthday"")Note: On 07 July 2020, I saw this film again.",The Last House on the Left
3,kosmasp,"""Classic""",6,31 July 2019,"Every horror movie claims for themselves that they kicked off something. Be it the slasher genre, be it the ""let's go all in and not censor ourselves"", be it the body count, gore, nudity, organs on display or whatever else you can imagine. In this case it is more the idea - although there are some short glimpses of visual and very explicit imagery.Wes Craven and Sean Cunnigham (who worked together on this and then went ahead to make two of the most iconic horror/movie villains of all time respectively - Freddy Kruger and Jason Vorhees) may feel like they wanted more or rather be more diverse. Do movies in other genres - but I do think they can be happy with their career. And it started with a very controversial and evil little movie like this one.The villains here are as despicable as they can get and the one moment where Wes claims they have a point of no return - well let's just say they are already past that way before that moment. So this is raw, it lacks sense in many respects and you can see there was not a big budget involved. But through it all you can feel the effect until today the movie had ... because of its success and because it was rough and did not really follow any rules",The Last House on the Left
4,gavin6942,"As Many Have Said, This Is Craven's ""Masterpiece""",9,5 February 2007,"From writer and director Wes Craven (""Nightmare on Elm Street"") and producer Sean S. Cunningham (""Friday the 13th""), comes a disturbing tale set in your neighborhood. Two girls celebrating a birthday go off to attend a concert, but fall prey to a group of prison escapees. Well, I think we all know what happens when teen girls meet convicted rapists.Many people have written that this film disappointed them or that it was over-hyped. Well, maybe. But as it's my third favorite horror film (after ""Re-Animator"" and ""Evil Dead 2"" but before ""The Beast Must Die!"") I feel that I should explain the wonders of this film.Objections will likely fall into two categories: those who don't like the film because it's old (it's from 1972 and doesn't try to hide it) and those who watched the heavily edited VHS copy (the 82 minute rather than the 91 minute version). I can't make you like older movies and I can't help it if you watched an edited version (though, in my opinion, the edited version is still creepier than many films out there today). If you don't mind older films and you watched the uncut version, then you really do dislike the film and we need to have a sit down chat.Where this film is strong is not in the gore or nudity (though we have some of both) but in the fact that unlike every other horror film out there, this could actually happen. Much like ""Slashed Dreams"" with Robert Englund, though this is more horror and that is more drama. There is no scene with the ""monsters"" that could not happen every day in your state if someone were sick enough to do it. No aliens, ghosts, mutant powers, superhuman strength or coming back from the dead. Just people against people. And to me, that's terrifying. Because people have suffered the way the two innocent girls (""innocent"" compared to the kids in most horror films) suffer in this movie.The acting is alright, too, and the music from star David Hess is great. I think some people dislike the music quite a bit (see again above, some people don't like it's from 1972). The only thing about the music I didn't like is the ""bumbling cops"" theme. In fact, the bumbling cops could have been toned down extremely. (Some have called this a very black comedy, I don't see it that way... though the cops make me wonder.) The other music (like ""The Road Leads to Nowhere"") seems to fit fine, and at least one song ended up on ""The Devil's Rejects"" soundtrack, as well as ""Cabin Fever"" so I don't stand alone in thinking the idea works.Towards the later parts with the ""death house"" (or as I call it, the ""McAllister House"") the horror elements increase. And some of it might seem far-fetched (one part to me is even a bit extreme and disgusting) but again -- this could happen in real life. The booby traps foreshadow the traps used against Freddy Krueger.The DVD is worth owning for the special features, including the featurette that has interviews with almost everyone who appeared in the film, except Sandra Cassel Peabody who played Mari Collingwood. The commentary is hilarious and a rare conversation between Sean Cunningham and Wes Craven, the men who worked on this film and went on to each create an insanely successful horror franchise. The dailies and outtakes, preserved by noted film archivist Roy Frumkes, show the extended intestine scene (where the guts were actually condoms stuffed with peanut butter and jelly, tied together).This is ""a film from Lobster Enterprises"", a production company that only made one other film: Sean Cunningham's 1973 bomb ""Case of the Full Moon Murders"". Good luck finding a copy of that!Other things aren't coming to my mind at this moment, so I'll wrap it up. See this movie. I mean, look, I gave it a perfect score! How often do I give films perfect scores? If you like horror, you need to see this, because it really set down the ground rules for modern horror films. Craven and Cunningham have careers from this film, and many other people have received inspiration. It predates both Bob Clark and John Carpenter. Seriously, check it out.",The Last House on the Left
5,lee_eisenberg,Wes Craven has come a LONG way from this.,2,8 November 2006,"I recently read an article enumerating horror movies that can appeal to left-wingers and horror movies that can appeal to right-wingers. ""The Last House on the Left"" appeared in the latter category, as it portrays some hippies getting their comeuppances for their carefree, love-centric lifestyle (of course, horror movies always kill people for having sex, as we learned in ""Scream""). But even ignoring that, the movie looks VERY amateur, with lousy acting and obviously staged scenes. It's not terrible. It's just that Wes Craven's movies since this have gotten so neat that this one doesn't seem to amount to very much. Still, it's neat to see the parents getting nasty. Check it out if possible, but don't expect anything great.",The Last House on the Left
6,Woodyanders,Doesn't quite live up to its notorious and controversial cult classic reputation,7,11 June 2010,"Wes Craven's first foray into the horror genre has been both praised and vilified with equal vehemence throughout the years. While it's way too crude and imperfect to qualify as a true masterpiece, it nonetheless has enough merits to ensure that it isn't a complete wash-out. Instead, this movie wavers betwixt and between being vile, crass, and revolting exploitation trash on one hand and having a relevant and provocative point to make about the intrinsic ugliness and barbarity of violence and how said violence scars, corrupts, and/or destroys all of those who either perpetuate it or are exposed to same. Craven deserves praise for his obdurate refusal to either sanitize or glamorize the unflinchingly graphic and sadistic violence shown herein; the protracted sequence with the two teenage girls being raped, tortured, humiliated, and murdered by the vicious criminal gang in the woods is every bit as horrible, unpleasant, and upsetting as it ought to be, with the single most devastating scene occurring when the gang suddenly realizes the ghastly enormity of what they've done after they kill the two girls. The acting is a decidedly mixed bag: David Hess as savage and sneering gang leader Krug Stillo, Fred Lincoln as the equally ferocious and depraved Fred ""Weasel"" Podowski, and Jeramie Rain as coarse and abrasive bisexual moll Sadie are all frightfully believable in their absolute baseness and wickedness, Marc Sheffler is genuinely pitiable as Krug's meek and browbeaten heroin addict illegitimate son Junior, Lucy Grantham as the sweet and naive Mari Collingwood and Sandra Cassell as Mari's sassy and more worldly friend Phyllis Stone are likewise credible and appealing, but Richard Towers and Cynthia Carr as Mari's straight-arrow parents both give terribly stiff and unpersuasive performances. Moreover, the clumsy moments of ill-judged humor are embarrassing and woefully out of place; the scene with the two bumbling cops (one of whom is played by future ""Karate Kid"" movie series regular Martin Kove!) and a toothless old black hag is downright painful to watch. Hess' alternately wonky and melodic score for the most part works; the folks songs in particular are lovely and poignant, but the happy and jaunty bluegrass music that plays during the abduction sequence comes across like a heavy-handed attempt at ironic counterpoint. Victor Hurwitz's rough and plain cinematography greatly adds to the overall gritty documentary-style cinema veritate realism. A severely flawed, but still pretty good and ultimately quite powerful and unsettling picture.",The Last House on the Left
7,Tweekums,A disturbing classic horror,8,15 July 2018,"To celebrate her seventeenth birthday Mari Collingwood plans to go to a concert in the city with her friend Phyllis Stone. On the way the radio reports that dangerous criminal, Krug Stillo, has escaped from jail along with his drug addict son, Junior; they are helped by psychotic Sadie and Fred ""Weasel"" Podowski. Before heading to the concert Mari and Phyllis decide to buy some cannabis; unfortunately the person they ask is Junior. Once they are in the flat with the criminals things soon get very bad. The next morning the two girls are drugged and bundled into the boot the thugs' car. They drive out into the country where, following a breakdown things get much worse. While this is going on Mari's parents are concerned that she is very late returning home so contact the police.This film may be over forty five years old but it still has the power to shock and disturb thanks to the fact that it feels quite real for the most part. The antagonists the sort of criminals we hear about on the news not supernatural fiends. The use of pleasant music and some ridiculously comic moments, usually involving two police officers, just serves to make the nasty bits seem even more disturbing. Once the girls are in the clutches of the criminals there is a constant sense of threat; sometimes the violence is physical and sometimes sexual. The film does rely on one very unlikely coincidence involving just where the criminals' car breaks down but that is needed for dramatic reasons. The final act, which relied on that coincidence, does go over the top somewhat but even this doesn't feel too out of place. The cast does an impressive job making their characters believable. Overall I'd say this is a must see for fans of classic horror films but it certainly won't be for everybody.",The Last House on the Left
8,BA_Harrison,A superb slice of extreme 70s low-budget horror.,8,6 October 2006,"When pretty birthday girl, Mari, and her friend, Phyllis, try to score some weed on the way to a concert, they fall prey to a gang of scumbags (being hunted by the police) who torture and kill the teens. After their car breaks down, the murderous lowlifes (posing as travelling insurance salesmen) seek refuge at a nearby house which, by sheer coincidence, belongs to Mari's parents. Mari's mother discovers the truth about her guests, and she and her husband plot their revenge.One of the most infamous horror movies of the 70s, The Last House on the Left is a truly brutal and shocking tale of murder and retribution. It may be an indisputably nasty moviedirector, Wes Craven, packs his sleazy tale with torture, rape, and violent deathbut it is also an extremely effective one, managing to realistically portray the abhorrence of murder and the depravity of those who commit the crime.By contrasting the extreme violence with scenes of lowbrow humour, Craven also manages to pull off rather a neat trick, managing to make the horror even more difficult to handle: the sight of a teenage girl being repeatedly stabbed seems so much worse when preceded by a scene featuring bumbling cops falling off the roof of a truck!Even though the gore is kept to a minimum, this movie features several scenes guaranteed to sicken even the most hardened of horror fans. With one of the bad guys carving his name into poor Mari's chest before raping her, and Phyllis almost managing to escape before being stabbed to death, this is not an easy film to stomach. However, those seeking out a genuinely compelling and taboo-breaking piece of film-making would do well to check out this classic of extreme cinema.Wes Craven's finest moment? Quite possibly...",The Last House on the Left
9,moonspinner55,Not shocking or scary so much as simply depressing...,2,12 November 2005,"Early Wes Craven effort shows off the young filmmaker's burgeoning interest in everyday horrors. Craven, working on an extremely limited budget, creates a familiar scenario with ordinary people and then throws sadism, humiliation and murder into the mix (he did this again a few years later with ""The Hills Have Eyes""). A drive-in variation on Ingmar Bergman's ""The Virgin Spring"", the film concerns two free-spirited young girls out to score some drugs but instead being abducted by escaped convicts. Craven has the germ of an interesting concept--allegedly based on a true incident--and he manages to mount the dread and terror effectively enough, but the movie is garbled and sludgy, not to mention depressing, with vapid, disgusting villains. Still, it's watchable until the revenge-laden second-half, which is so poorly written and executed it mitigates any real interest in the outcome. An almost-immediate cult success, ""Last House"" spawned many imitations (""House by the Lake"", ""I Spit on Your Grave"", ""Mother's Day""), but the movie lacks even the smallest semblance of class. * from ****",The Last House on the Left
10,Quinoa1984,a very different film from the rest of Craven's oeuvre- Virgin Spring suffused with nihilism inspired by Vietnam,4,31 July 2006,"I would probably guess that The Last House on the Left, like Night of the Living Dead or even Texas Chainsaw Massacre to an extent, is as much a 'horror' movie as it is a reaction to the Vietnam war. It's a film that goes to lengths to push the envelope to the point where you almost have to think about why there's an envelope to start with. Maybe Wes Craven has directed other movies I've yet to see that are as bloody as this, but the sheer pitiless, gut-wrenching nature of the picture is one that is very hard to take. That it leaves such an indelible impression that I can still recall the murder scenes midway through the movie, done in such a way that it shows violence as being as sickening and despicable a thing as it can be, is undeniable. That it also has the production values of a student film is also hard to ignore. This is a work by a filmmaker with more ambition than he can really grasp onto for such a cheapie exploitation flick.The basic story is borrowed, more or less (probably less due to it just being the broad elements), from Bergman's the Virgin Spring, which by and large dealt with similarly tragic and consequential ideas with humility, patience and with, needless to say, far greater actors. It's about two girls who go into the forest, get picked up by some sicko criminal types, get raped and mutilated and killed in a drawn out fashion. Then the killers, oddly enough, wind up at the house that the girl's parents live at, soon to meet a very sordid and fatalistic ending. None of the film is 'easy', which does give it a lasting power. This is a film that conjures up, more than anything, what it must be like to be in such a horrific situation. It's almost like if a documentary film student were filming the out-takes of a slasher movie. So the intentions behind it, and how the actors in much of the first part of the film, try to give themselves to the material, is staggering and kind of amazing. If Craven's point is to squeeze tighter the politically correct noose and try to connect with people during a bloody war of its own period, the point is made at least on a visceral level during these scenes.The big problem then, at least for me, is that Craven still hasn't found himself really altogether as a filmmaker. And he also isn't totally sure what kind of film he's making. Is it a satirical statement on violence and its social effect like Clockwork Orange, a pure exploitation-style horror movie with exaggerated characters without much dimension, or a documentary-style tome on the loss of faith? Unlike Bergman's film, which really held together the idea of the story being more like a fable than anything, Craven's The Last House on the Left is a kind of jumbled up lot of the above elements. But, in a way, sometimes you almost wish the filmmaker wouldn't get in the way or little aspects, such as placing such f***ed up sound effects during the scenes of violence or the somber, melodramatic music. Any satirical elements aren't really developed well in the script, as the 'comedy' of sorts is very base and near puerile. And the actors, with maybe one or two exceptions, seem too amateurish to pull off the material. After a while it becomes more of an exercise in repulsion than anything very redeemable cinematically (and I say this as someone who's hard to really shock or offend with horror films, unless they commit a crime of being boring or pretentious- something this film comes close enough to doing).So, in the end, I felt mixed on The Last House on the Left. It's a film with trying for something to say, or at least seems that way, and it's got the gusto to try and rise to a more intellectual level. But it also is- and Craven himself has stated this- a flick for the grind-house circuits, where people may be ready for shockable material, but not for a mush-mash of dialog that usually doesn't work as well as the actors think it does and performances that even by low-budget standards of 1972 are weak. In the end I wanted to laugh at the film, like any other bad horror movie, but ended up cringing more often than not (and not in the way the filmmakers might have intended).",The Last House on the Left
11,tavm,The original version of The Last House on the Left it still effective in the first hour before almost going downhill after that,7,2 May 2010,"While I had previously watched this movie on YouTube, that site had a couple of 10-minute segments cut out. I finally watched those missing 20 minutes after I just bought the unrated version from last year. To tell the truth, while what was shown was disturbing, they weren't completely shocking. What was shocking was the silent never-before-seen footage on the extras where you see complete nudity and sex acts that apparently were cut before the original theatrical release. Anyway, seeing Mari (Sandra Cassell) and Phylis (Lucy Grantham) violated like that were the most effective scenes of this now-iconic film. Certainly the behaviors of the criminal gang of Weasel (Fred Lincoln), Sadie (Jeramie Rain), Junior (Marc Sheffler), and especially, Krug (David Hess), are depraved beyond repair though Junior tries to act a little responsible but father Krug just steers him wrong every time. And Mari's parents-Dr. and Mrs. Collingwood (Gaylord St. James and Cynthia Carr) sure don't waste time for revenge though some of those scenes, especially the one where Weasel gets ""his"" from the mother, seem a bit over-the-top for such a more realistic depiction early on of torture and death (though of course that doesn't mean one won't get a cathartic thrill of said scenes). Obviously, writer and director Wes Craven wanted some light relief as evidenced by some of the cheery banjo songs (provided by David Hess himself) and the comic antics of the sheriff (Marshall Anker) and his deputy son (Martin Kove, later known for his roles on ""Cagney and Lacey"" and The Karate Kid). I liked some of that music but didn't find any of the police antics funny. Still, The Last House on the Left is a fascinating movie for the still effective torture scenes, for what the early '70s were like culturally, and for what Wes Craven and producer Sean S. Cunningham had achieved before their more popular films (A Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th, respectively) came to being.",The Last House on the Left
12,Coventry,"It's got ""landmark"" written all over it",9,19 July 2003,"First of all, let me tell you that I'm getting really angry when I read most other user comments. They all go like ""oh, it's not that scary"" and ""This film isn't disturbing"" and, even worse: ""Scream was much better"". I beg your pardon? Do these people fail to realize that this was the best movie Wes Craven ever did ? And what the hell do they mean ...not disturbing at all ? Last house on the left is like the definition of disturbing !!! Sorry, I had to spill my guts out on that one...Now for the movie. Let's keep one thing in mind here. This film was made in 1972. It's actually scary to itself that this film is way ahead on its time. Same thing with TCM, both these movies handle about a subject most people wouldn't even dream to mention it on film. There just are some films that couldn't be placed into categories. Neither can you call them bad or good, because even if you didn't like them you still have to admit they were very important to the world of cinema. Last house on the left is one of those films. Now, I liked it. I even liked it a lot, but still my respect for this film is even bigger than my love for it. Because I recognize it as a landmark. In horror and in cinema in general. Mari and Phyllis are on their way to a hard-rock festival when they get kidnapped by escaped villains. 3 men and one wicked lady. These people humiliate the girls, rape them and eventually kill them both. Their car broke down in front of the house were Mari lived. Her parents let them spend the night there and during their stay the parents find out they killed their daughter. The set up a whole ambush to avenge their little girl... This film was brought to us by 2 major names in the field of horror. Sean S. Cunningham and Wes Craven. At the time they made Last house they didn't know yet that they would be responsible for the biggest hype in horror 30 years later. Characters they've created are set in a line-up (Freddy VS Jason) I think they were both at their peak here. I respect them mostly for what they made here, cause I can imagine it's not easy to make such a controversial film in the early 70's. You must watch this film. For the brutality and for the emotions especially. And if you can, try to get your hands on the special edition DVD which was brought out recently. It contains very fascinating interviews with both creators of this film in which they explain who hard it was to bring it to the public. I can't praise it enough. As a horror fan but also a film freak in general I recommend this film to everyone who isn't too weak-hearted.My humble opinion on LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT = 10/10. and I'm not being generous... it really deserves this rating.",The Last House on the Left

14,Theo Robertson,It`s A Good Laugh,6,16 June 2003,"Once upon a time LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT was banned in the UK but I fail to see what the problem was . It`s not a film to be taken seriously , I mean look at it , a bunch of dangerous criminals escape from prison and kidnap a couple of teenage girls . This might have been disturbing violent trash but it`s all done in a tongue in cheek manner . For starters the criminal gang somehow reminded me of Portland retro pop group The Dandy Warhols (!)while there`s a couple of keystone cops . The script is ridiculously contrived while the acting is truly hopeless and I can`t help thinking Wes Craven knew what he was doing while making it , it`s a gigantic mickey take in order to offend self appointed moral guardians .

15,Scarecrow-88,Last House on the Left,7,25 May 2008,"Two teenage gals, newly friends, are on their way to a rock concert when they desire to score some reefer and wind up in the throes of terror when the supplier, Junior(Marc Sheffler) is actually the junkie son of an recently escaped psycho from prison, Krug(David Hess)who are holing up in a shoddy apartment with another sicko Weasel(Fred J Lincoln)and their nutso girlfriend Sadie(Jeramie Rain). After having their way with Phyllis(Lucy Grantham), the street gal, as her virginal friend Mari(Sandra Cassel)looks on in horror, the psychopathic four toss them in their car trunk the next day, hitting the road for Canada when the vehicle runs out of gas. The kicker is that the car runs out of gas just nearby Mari's home, yet neither girl can cry out. Into the wilderness the girls are forced into committing humiliating acts or else suffer the consequences. Yet, even after being run through the ringer(..Phyllis forced by Krug to pee in her pants, the two having to commit lesbian acts, both girls stripping, etc), their lives are still jeopardy as Phyllis attempts to escape as Mari, having been cut by Weasel earlier, suffers mental anguish hoping to coerce Junior into letting her go as the others run after the other. When the escapes fail, the four will finish them off and clean up, finding themselves at the home of Mari's parents. When Mari's father and mother(Richard Towers & Cynthia Carr)find that these cretins, who they have allowed rooms to sleep for the night, have murdered their baby girl, revenge is on the menu.Getting past the brouhaha of how unpleasant and disturbing it is, I'll skip to the moments that effected me. The way Weasel moves his knife up and down his nose just itching to stick it in someone. How quietly intense and homicidal Hess is as Krug..bulking and tough, his menacing features are even more fearsome because of his brooding nature. Jearmie Rain, out of the four killers, is the most over-the-top and demented, loudly applauding her men's cruel and violent behavior, relishing their graphic acts on these two girls. Marc Sheffler's ugly features work well with such a pathetic character, who never had a chance in life considering who his father is. He's as much a victim as Mari and Phyllis. I actually thought Lincoln, as the no-nonsense killer Weasel(..always seen with his knife as if it were an extension of his pecker, taking good care of it), is about as good as Krug. He just doesn't care about anything, except the knife and getting to use it and having no sense of morality or conscience makes him almost as much a monster as Krug. I think Craven achieves what he sets out for with these sick bastards..if you are caught alone with these people, vulnerable, you have little chance of surviving because they have no boundaries holding them, no reason or guilt. I can see the film's influence on modern horror particularly in the photography as the camera often shoots characters from odd angles, sometimes capturing one or more actors on screen close-up or just a few feet away. The wilderness murders I found especially effective, although a lot of the violence is hinted instead of fully elaborated on. I think the film's in-your-face camera directing into the faces of the psychos works quite well as they inflict harm to the girls, with their faces showing the trauma occurring to them both physically and emotionally. When someone tosses the word ""raw"" out there, I think it's quite appropriate for Craven's film here. There's no cinematic polish in store for a viewer watching this for the first time. I think the film is simple in story, with the shocking violence doing the most work in leaving the lasting impression. Almost like a true crime story of what a group of serial killers do to victims in the wrong place at the wrong time with fate dealing them a bad hand, LHotL works from a very terrifying level, and I felt Craven's camera-work and editing of the wilderness murders displays just that. It felt like someone, hanging around with the brood, was filming their deranged activities.The revenge angle, I think Craven has mentioned this before, displays the theme that almost anyone, if pushed over the edge by some sort of horrifying ordeal, could kill.

16,Hey_Sweden,"Grim, horrific, and powerful.",7,2 September 2015,"Many years before they would both begin slasher franchises that would compete with each other, debuting filmmaker Wes Craven and producer Sean S. Cunningham collaborated on this ugly but compelling bit of cinema. The filmmaking is undeniably crude, but the subject matter is effectively upsetting. ""The Last House on the Left"" offers up the kind of experience that one doesn't easily shake, and may engender very personal love-it-or-loathe-it reactions. The performances aren't slick and polished, but they're still right on the money. One feels for the victims and feels the need for a shower just watching our Manson Family-type antagonists.Two teenage girls, Mari (Sandra Peabody), and Phyllis (Lucy Grantham), are on their way to a rock concert when they make the impulsive - and fatal - decision to try to score some grass. This brings them into contact with prison escapee Krug Stillo (David Hess) and his grimy associates, Fred 'Weasel' Podowski (Fred J. Lincoln), Sadie (Jeramie Rain), and Krugs' illegitimate, junkie son Junior Stillo (Marc Sheffler). This gang of lowlifes puts the girls through a nightmare of torture and degradation, but their comeuppance comes from an appropriate source due to an incredible coincidence.An acknowledged reworking of Ingmar Bergmans' ""The Virgin Spring"", this features some very potent violence and gore. For our victims, it plays like a bad dream that seems to have no end. To provide us with some respite from the horror, Craven creates a film that is unfortunately mixed tonally. The comedy relief from incompetent cops Marshall Anker and Martin Kove is simply too silly. Also, Hess's score is a little too upbeat for a chase scene that should be more harrowing.Peabody and Grantham are appealing, even if their characters don't act too sensibly. It's also not hard to feel bad for Junior, who is just pathetic. Richard Towers and Cynthia Carr are okay as Maris' parents, but the show entirely belongs to the villains. Hess in particular proves to have a real presence, and a real knack for playing the most degenerate character imaginable.There's one very memorable gag involving Carr and Lincoln, and a delicious final fight between sadist and avenger.Future director Steve Miner was an assistant editor, production assistant, and bit player (as one of the hippies taunting the cops).Seven out of 10.",The Last House on the Left

They rape and torture them to death only to be killed themselves by two parents of one of the girls.I love horror films and graphic things don't upset me but I find this film totally repulsive. It was shot on next to no budget and looks like a documentary which makes it seem realistic. Also the acting is good which makes it even worse. The scenes where the two teenage girls are tortured are just needlessly sick and they play cheerful music over it! When I watched this on DVD I had to keep turning it off because I was so disgusted with what I was watching. The movie makes you FEEL dirty by pushing this in your face.Purportedly this is based on Bergman's ""The Virgin Spring"" but I have my doubts. Also Wes Craven disowns this film now. He was so viciously attacked by people for the content of this that he'll have nothing to do with it. All the cast members were interviewed for a book on this years ago--THEY hate the film too and think it's a piece of garbage! Let me put it this way--one of the men went on from this to making porno films--he made over 100 pornos and STILL considers this the worst film ever made!This was a huge drive-in hit during the 1970s and 1980s and had an ad line which became famous--""To avoid fainting keep repeating it's only a movie, it's only a movie, it's only a movie..."" It was paired with ""Don't Look in the Basement"" and ""The House That Vanished""--two other really bad horror films but nowhere as offensive as this one.

18,poolandrews,"""How would you like me to put my boot up your a*s, sideways?"" Notorious exploitation film.",7,27 August 2005,"The Last House on the Left begins by informing us that the events in the film are actually based on reality. It is broadcast on the news that Krug Stillo (David Hess) has escaped from prison with the help of his illegitimate heroin addicted son Junior (Marc Sheffler), his friend Fred 'Weasel' Podowski (Fred Lincoln) & his girlfriend Sadie (Jeramie Rain). They are described as murderers, dope pushers & rapists & that they are probably hiding out somewhere in New York. Mari Collingwood (Sandra Cassel) is celebrating her 17th birthday with her friend Phyllis Stone (Lucy Grantham) when they encounter Junior whom they try to buy some grass from, Junior takes them back to a motel room where Krug, Weasel & Sadie lie in wait to kidnap the two teenagers. The next morning Mari & Phyllis are shoved in Krug's car boot as he & his accomplice's decide to drive to Canada. By now Mari's parents John (Gaylord St. James) & Estelle (Cynthia Carr) are worried enough to call the local Sheriff (Marshall Anker) & his Deputy (Martin Kove). On their way Krug & co. break down in a wooded area ironically mere yards from Mari's house where they take both girls deep into the woods to have some sick, twisted & perverted fun with them...Edited, written & directed by Wes Craven The Last House on the Left is undeniably a powerful film but I found it somewhat unpleasant to watch. The script is about evil people doing evil things to good people, these evil characters are total scum who have no remorse & no feelings while the good characters are homely upstanding members of the community who in the end sink to the same level as Krug & his gang. Maybe The Last House on the Left's moral message is the means justify the ends. For some reason Craven decided to include two comedy relief police officers who feel very out of place & inappropriate. The nastiness in The Last House on the Left isn't overly graphic but is quite shocking, they make Phyliss pee herself & pull her intestines out while they cut Mari with a knife & then shoot her. The parents revenge scenes aren't that graphic either apart from a slit throat & a silly castration. Technically The Last House on the Left is very basic & was obviously shot on a hand held camera, it has a simplistic bleak almost documentary like atmosphere & feel to it. I hated the music, credited to star David Hess which just got on my nerves & seemed out of place at times. The acting is variable, the two girls do very well & Hess & his gang do a good job of making you hate them while Mari's parents are terrible. I thought The Last House on the Left was a pretty good exploitation film that moved along at a fair pace & is certainly a powerful film but at the same time I found it all rather bleak, a bit depressing & I don't really enjoy watching teenage girls being humiliated & brutally murdered. Maybe not a film for the casual viewer but exploitation & horror fans should try & watch it as I'm sure most of them will get something out of it.",The Last House on the Left

20,Boba_Fett1138,Pretty good debut movie from Wes Craven.,7,22 February 2009,"It's interesting to see how Wes Craven's directing career first started off, with this movie. It's a true '70's exploitation flick, that shows that Craven already was pretty much at ease within the genre, even early on in his career. He handles the theme well, even though the movie also has some unbalanced elements in it.As far as exploitation flicks go this movie is a real great one within its genre. It has a pretty good look and feel over it, that is required for the genre. Despite its obviously low budget the movie really isn't cheap looking, at least not compared to most other similar genre movies I have seen. It features all of the right ingredients you could expect from a movie like this and it has a pretty simple but nevertheless fine and effective concept. It's a story that is far from likely but who cares really. In these sort of movies a story is more like a secondary thing and it's only purpose is to provide the movie with the usual exploitation movie ingredients.The movie though is a bit of an unbalanced mix when it comes down to it's different elements. On the one hand it's an exploitation movie with thriller/horror elements to it, while in the other the movie also tries to throw in some quirky humor, which doesn't really strengthen its more exploitation like elements. The movie just feels a bit too unbalanced at times.I doubt the remake, which will hit the cinemas next week, will work out as well because of the simple reason that this movie is a true '70's exploitation flick, a genre that is long time death now and today will only work out as ridicules with todays used techniques and usual standards.It's violence and torturing sequences are all being handled well, with true skill. It's one of the things that makes this movie better than most other exploitation flicks from the glorious '70's. Also it's second halve, that is pretty insane, is what makes this movie a great watch, especially if you are into the genre.A nice directorial debut from the then still pretty young Wes Craven.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Last House on the Left
21,evanston_dad,Uneven and Unscary,3,27 June 2005,"Notable primarily as Wes Craven's first feature film, ""The Last House on the Left"" does not deserve the reputation it has garnered as one of the scariest films ever made. There's really nothing scary about this movie, except for the admittedly frightening idea of being murdered in your own back yard (figuratively speaking). Craven would have done better to really focus his film on either the murderers or on Mari. Instead, the focus is all over the place: first on Mari, then on the killers, then the cops, back to Mari, back to the killers, to Mari's parents. It all seems patched together and messy. And the uneasy juxtaposition of documentary-like rapings and killings (which are indeed disturbing) and slapstick comedy seems more like the product of a sloppy director than a tool used for its effect.No, ""The Last House on the Left"" is really only worthwhile viewing for horror buffs who want to have an opinion on it. Otherwise, you could produce something just as good using your home video camera.Grade: D",The Last House on the Left
22,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Solid enough but still somewhat flawed effort,8,1 September 2018,"Heading out for a party, a pair of friends get caught up in the activities of a gang of deranged thugs who proceed to humiliate and torture them before finally killing them, and once the thugs are done seek solace in her home forcing the parents to seek revenge on them once they find out.This was an enjoyable if somewhat flawed effort. What really tends to work best for this one is the dirty and scummy feel that comes from the whole setup of the film. The initial stages here, the drug-infused culture of depravity and junkie culture that the thugs wallow in when first brought up in the project's apartment they hide out in, sets the stage to come for the big squirm-inducing sequence in the middle of the woods where it really kicks into high gear in this department. Going from total degradation and humiliation to sexual abuse and other forms of mental torture that they inflict on the captured girls which is treated as a game for their amusement. This carries on into the main segment that employs that kind of sleazy feel which is the scene of the groups vicious attack on the girls. The central chasing through the woods is rather fun from the ability to outsmart them and dodge their advances to getting close to escaping and getting brutally murdered in the end to the horrifying rape sequence that they endure on her which is all the more disturbing for how it affects the group as well. The act that follows which sets up the whole point of their revenge takes this to a whole different level and serves as the perfect launching point for the madness and mayhem to follow as not only is the act itself wholly chilling and effective but it's the kind of plausible scenario that ideally could set off a killing spree that comes later. While the brutality of the final rampage is quite nice and generates some excitement in the action, that provides the first of the film's flaws. The action that comes about here is realistic which renders it quite sloppy and clumsy where it comes off looking staged and quite choreographed and it just gets somewhat comical to watch the two go at each. The battling with the ladies outside and how they manage to wind through the group isn't as rewarding as it should be which is quite disappointing. The other big flaw to be had with this one is the fact that the comical interludes with the deputies is highly inappropriate and downright unbearable to watch at times. Their bungling isn't all that cringe-inducing the way it should be, but it's the suddenness with how this dives into their scenes being rushed up against the brutality of the other scenes just having been shown which doesn't always work and makes for an odd juxtaposition. Otherwise, there isn't a whole lot to knock this one down.Rated R: Graphic Language, Extreme Graphic Violence, Full Nudity, a strong Rape and continuous drug use.",The Last House on the Left

24,Wuchakk,Dumb,2,12 March 2014,"I've heard quite a bit about Wes Craven's 1972 debut film ""Last House on the Left"" over the years and finally decided to see what the hoopla was all about.PLOT (***Spoilers***): ""Last House"" is a simple rape/murder/revenge horror flick about two Connecticut girls who go to the big city to catch a rock concert, but they look for pot in the wrong place and end up kidnapped, humiliated, tortured, raped and killed. When the father & mother of one of the victims find out they set out to take revenge; the culprits aren't hard to find 'cause they're, coincidently, overnight guests in their house! This is, apparently, a loose remake of Ingmar Bergman's ""Virgin Spring"" (1960), albeit in a modern America setting.WHAT WORKS: Aside from the brief Manhattan scenes, the woodsy Connecticut locations are great (Westport & Redding); the three female actors are cute; and the diversified score (by the actor playing Krug) is entertaining even while a lot of it is incongruous with the material. In addition, the film can be appreciated as an early 70s period piece/oddity or if you're a Craven fan.Also, if you're a gorehound there's some significant gore, in particular a bloody disembowelment sequence.WHAT DOESN'T WORK: Wow, this story is really DUMB. I'm not referring to just the goofy aspects, i.e. the two rural policemen, but to the complete implausibility of the storyline: ***SPOILER ALERT*** The criminal gang just so happens to break down right in front of the rural house of one of the victims? Why sure! But there's more, way more: After breaking down on some desolate country road the gang decides to take a frolic in the woods where they torment, rape & murder the girls; their clothes are completely bloody but they're able to fully wash up in a scummy pond and deck themselves to the hilt. Where'd they get the soap and towels, etc.? (I didn't see any) Where'd they get the nice dress clothes? Didn't they just escape from prison? Then they knock on the door of the closest house, the house of one of the victims (which they don't realize yet), and her parents cluelessly allow this suspicious foursome to stay overnight, a couple of 'em in their daughters very room -- unbelievable! Keep in mind that their daughter has been missing since the night before and they should be seriously concerned about that, but they're okay enough to allow four weirdo adult strangers to occupy their home -- Why sure! The revenge of the parents is just as ridiculous ***END SPOILER***. As noted above, many of these scenes are combined with an unfitting goofy score, which makes them all the more absurd. Really, the story is so ridiculous it's as if a 13 year-old came up with the plot but, no, it was written/directed by Wes Craven, a full-fledged adult with degrees in writing & psychology -- unbelievable.With this understanding, how can the viewer possibly take the story serious? Which is why I find it strange that some people call this ""the most disturbing film ever made,"" etc. If the material is absurd it can't truly be disturbing because it can't be taken seriously. Is the violence in the Road Runner disturbing? No. Why? Because it's a cartoon and it's preposterous. ""Last House"" may not be a cartoon but it's the same principle because it's just as preposterous.The reason 1978's ""I Spit On Your Grave"" works, for what it is, is because it's presented to the viewer in a serious, realistic manner (well, except for parts of the revenge scenes in the last 20 minutes -- but even those sequences are believable compared to the inanities of ""Last House""). Consequently, ""I Spit On Your Grave"" is disturbing, ""Last House"" is not.One may defend the film on the grounds that it was the first of its kind as far as gore goes. I don't think so. ""Night of the Living Dead"" came out four years earlier and has more gore, albeit in black & white. ""Night"" is a thousand times more disturbing and horrifying because, again, it takes the material serious.Some may object to how sick & sadistic the criminal scumbags are, but they're supposed to be appalling because this is a rape/murder/revenge horror flick. It comes with the territory.BOTTOM LINE: I generously give ""Last House"" 2/10 for the positive elements noted above but, really, this is one of the dumbest flicks I've ever seen. I find it hard to believe it ever got a green light. You gotta see it to believe it, meaning it's definitely worthwhile as an early 70s curiosity.The film runs 84 minutes and the original cut 91 minutes.GRADE: D-",The Last House on the Left
25,The_Void,Classic slice of exploitation cinema!,9,21 October 2007,"The first time I saw this film was before I'd seen a lot of exploitation, and I have to say that I found the whole thing to be quite uncomfortable; though I won't say I didn't enjoy it. I have now seen many an exploitation flick, and I will still say that The Last House on the Left is a shocking and uncomfortable slice of exploitation cinema. The film takes influence from Ingmar Bergman's best film, The Virgin Spring, though director Wes Craven has seen fit to add in a load of sex, gore and general sleaze. The plot is completely simple, as is the case with most seventies exploitation flicks, and this gives the film more room to do what it's really meant to do - shock and disgust the viewer. We focus on two young girls who decide to go to a rock concert. On the way, scoring some pot seems like a good idea and one of them asks someone they think is a dealer if he can spare any. It turns out that he was the wrong person to ask, as he's a part of a gang of escaped convicts, and when he takes the girls to meet the rest of the gang; they decide it's time to have some fun...The Last House on the Left, aside from being a nasty film, is also a rather strange one - and that's mostly owing to the soundtrack and apparent misplaced humour. The humour seems to be in place to offset the terror, but if you ask me it makes the film even more shocking, as it feels like Craven is having a laugh at the plight of the two young victims. It's also quite funny. The film would appear to fairly ambiguous other than that, however, as Craven doesn't force the audience into making a judgement on any character in the film; they are all basically what they are. Wes craven would go on to make a number of important horror films after this one; but none of them manage to capture the raw shock value of The Last House on the Left, and I would not hesitate to call this his best film. The film is gritty and the production values are quite low, which is pretty much what you would expect from a film like this; but that is certainly not a bad thing. The film only runs for about eighty minutes, but the film certainly gets its message across, and Craven also manages to keep it entertaining for the duration, which is to its benefit.

Okay, it's not quite that bad. Bergman's The Virgin Spring lends well to an exploitation remake, and The Last House on the Left works when it's being particularly exploitative (i.e., the murder, rape and revenge scenes). Unfortunately, the film is marred by the terrible acting (okay, sort of forgivable for what is pretty much a homemade film), terrible moments of comic relief (they really needed to drop the two dopey cop characters, and that whole scene with the chicken lady) and, by far the worst offense of all, the goofy AM Gold music selection.

Anyway, they kidnap the two girls and you can imagine the horror. They bring up to the suburbs where somehow they end up in Mari's parents home. I won't spoil the rest.

Maybe not.,7,4 April 2021,"It seems strange to have just watched this again after some 40 years and on a pristine blu-ray disc, packed with extras, rather than on a grotty videotape. I don't like it any more than I did the first time but then it is clear this was not set up to be liked so much as to make a statement, a scream perhaps. Hardly a coherent statement remonstrating against the Vietnam war but a symptom no doubt of the growing feeling, at the time, that not all was sweet and light with regard to the so called peace and love movement. Increased freedom for the young, provided the opportunity, not just to lay around making love but also to question and explore the darker aspects of life. Wes Craven and pals certainly did that here and the result is shocking, even today. Craven speaks of a pervasive nastiness affecting the actors and crew at the time and perhaps because of the largely amateur nature of the enterprise, this hesitancy, despite the apparent bravura, is still evident. It is an almost plotless effort centred around the towering and worrying performance of David Hess and effective ones from the two young girls, Sandra Peabody and Lucy Grantham who suffer such ignominious a fates. Other performances are rather embarrassing but it all gets mixed in the wash as there is much chasing around the woods, nasty talking and even more nasty abuse. I don't think the revenge sequence is any more successful or gratifying than the rest, more that it is all part of the general grubbiness and a poke in the eye for all those who really believe that human beings are essentially destined to live peaceably as one without considering that more base and self interested tendency that lurks so very close to the surface with a tendency to explode given the slightest of opportunities.

There is plenty of degrading and demented acts performed during this film, which clearly shows how very sick some adult men and women can be in this world.

It's even later when Estelle finds Mari's blood stain clothing in Krug's suitcase that she together with her husband Dr. John plan to justifiably take revenge against the entire slimy bunch in the same way that they murdered their daughter Mari and Phyllis; As brutal and painful as humanly possible!A cult classic that has gained new fans at every screening in the 1970's and is now among the top slasher movies of all times ""Last House on the Left"" still packs a wallop that's hard to duplicated, with top studio state of the art special effects, even in todays horror flicks. The sheer brutality of the murders of both Mari & Phyllis comes across so realistic that the film had to put in a disclaimer to it's audience telling them ""It's only a movie"" in order to keep those watching from freaking out in the theaters.As savage as the murders of the Mari & Phyllis were the retaliation by Mari's parents against their killers was almost as, if not more, as gruesome. The trio of killers with the exception of Junior, who was egged on by his dad Krug to do himself in, ended up getting their just desert after a night of being treated to Mrs. Estelle Collingwood's delicious, their last meal, spaghetti and meatball dinner. By the time the both bumbling sheriff and his deputy, who were used as comedy relief by director Craven, finally came on the scene their was not enough left of murderous psycho killers to be even be given a proper burial!",The Last House on the Left
34,Robert_duder,Exploitive and disturbing. Not really a horror film and yet horrific all the same,8,29 December 2008,"Wes Craven went on to a terrific horror slasher career and became a master of the slasher horror, something I have been a big fan of for a very long time so it was with great interest that I picked up a copy of Last House On The Left. I can say two distinct things about this film. First of all...it is NOT a slasher flick or even a horror flick and it just barely borders a thriller. When all is said and done Last House On The Left is an early seventies exploitation film that easily pushes the boundaries of film vs gratuity. While the film is intense and watchable and I certainly enjoyed watching it from an entertainment perspective BUT I honestly don't think I'd ever watch it again on purpose. It just really doesn't have anything that would make one want to watch it again. In some ways the film is very timeless and could be relevant to situations nowadays in that kidnapping is very real and twisted and disturbing. Certainly the entire story and plot written by Wes Craven is entirely twisted in itself. The twist to the end of the story is horrifying to any parent or any person who has had a kidnapping situation relevant to them.The cast is solid enough and although there isn't well known talent involved they do a good job especially the kidnappers. Sandra Cassel and Lucy Grantham play the lead girls in the film. Young and wild and anxious to enjoy a night away at a concert but by being in the wrong place at the wrong time they are kidnapped by twisted, disturbed convicts. Both girls are taken on mostly to show gratuitous nudity and scream a lot but they do a decent job making you feel their emotions. Cassel never did anything but 70's exploitation films and Grantham never did anything else. David Hess, Fred Lincoln and Marc Sheffler are stand out performers in the film as the three male psychos who kidnap and torture and rape the two girls. Hess is brilliant as the leader of the crew, they really are perfect for their roles. Jeramie Rain plays the only female psycho Sadie. I think she is more of a figure head to not make this torturous situation, three guys ganging up on two innocent girls seem quite so bad and for that reason her role kind of works but she is pointless outside of that. She cackles and stumbles through a pointless character. Richard Towers and Cynthia Carr are decent as the Collingwoods, the parents of one of the missing girls who finds themselves face to face with their daughter's killers. They really show some great performance later in the film fighting back against them.The film has a really terrific pace. Everything happens at break neck speed and sincerely keeps you on the edge of your seat and is genuinely shocking. I don't think I'm easily shocked when it comes to films but there is something gritty and realistic about watching this film. The movie doesn't pour blood like something like Saw or Hostel so it might not seem like the same level of disturbing and yet there is something untapped and creepy about the way the film is shot. In my mind low budget makes a film far more creepy than having big special effects. When all is said and done if you are a horror buff or just love Wes Craven then chances are you need to see this film but it certainly won't be one you keep on your shelf for a rainy day and remaking it will be a joke although in all honesty I would certainly check it out because I am like that when it comes to ""horror"" remakes but it's a mistake to remake something like this. 8/10",The Last House on the Left
35,Bored_Dragon,Terrible,2,5 October 2016,"Thriller?! For a movie to be a thriller it must have a plot, suspense, tension, mystery, something... This movie is linear, predictable, vulgar simple... but Craven was able to do something I have never seen before - he made explicit and credible scenes of rape, torture, and brutal violence boring, without any tension and without leaving any impression on the viewer. Horror?! The only scary thing in this movie is the fact that it is scary stupid. Disgusting - yes, but there's no trace of horror or thriller. Acting and directing irresistibly reminds me of low-budget porn. And scenes of nature followed by pleasant, even merrily music definitely don't contribute to tension, but even more departing this movie from genres it should represent. I didn't rate it 1/10 only because it was inspired by Bergman and because I did succeed to watch it till the end without my brain leaking through my ears.2/10",The Last House on the Left
36,kenjha,House of Hacks,1,11 June 2006,"This is a horrible film and not because of the subject matter. ""I Spit on Your Grave"" (1978), a film with a similar theme and settings, is far, far superior to this trash. The acting is embarrassingly bad. The script is illogical and stupid. The characters are one-dimensional caricatures. The cinematography is grainy and soft. The music is cheesy. The direction is obviously the work of a hack. The overuse of closeups is annoying. Craven repeatedly pans the camera to something totally irrelevant to the plot. It looks like the budget for this film was about $1.98 and that some of that money was returned to the producer. Some films are trashy but enjoyable. This isn't one of them.",The Last House on the Left

I'm a fan of Craven so I came into it with somewhat solid hopes.Nope...it sucked.Now to be fair....I can see why it WOULD have been quite something at its time of release, however it has aged really badly.

40,Fella_shibby,A harrowing ordeal.,8,29 January 2017,"I saw this first on a VHS in the early 90s. Revisited recently on a DVD. I own the dvds of the original n the remake. Its directed and written by Wes Craven, produced by Sean S. Cunningham. Two big names in horror fraternity. This is a film in which we get to watch a trio of men and a woman abuse two young girls for fun which is shocking and awful. Its about unendurable pain and suffering meted out to two innocent girls by pitiless human monsters. A wave of nausea fell over me as I watched the young girls being brutally raped and savagely murdered. It's one of the most realistic depictions of true sadism and has proved to be one of the most shocking scenes in cinematic history. The film is a harrowing ordeal that isn't about suspense, thrill or adventure. Its about agony n revenge. Revenge in a non stylized manner. I prefer the revenge killings from the remake.",The Last House on the Left
41,insomniac_rod,Craven shows the misery of humanity. One of the best of it's kind.,5,30 April 2006,"Masterpiece!? Yes, the movie is disturbing but for the wrong reasons. Craven shows people committing the most brutal crimes in explicit manners. It's disturbing because people are not used to act like that. The ""best"" thing of the movie is that it's disturbing because you might think that it could happen to you. Reality bites sometimes.""Last House On The Left"" shows the behavior of a gang of rapers torturing and humiliating two innocent girls. The plot behind their actions is your typical revenge situation but in a raw manner. Craven deserves some respect for having quality gore in an exploitation flick. And I don't know if Tobe Hooper was influenced by this movie and later used the ""chainsaw"" idea... Craven is responsible for having many imitators during the upcoming years. I can't think of how many movies have the ""last house on the..."" title. Anyways, ""Last House On The Left"" is highly overrated. Many people praise this movie because they think it's a ""must see"" or a ""masterpiece"". Many people tend to praise something just because it's famous or polemical. Don't get me wrong. The movie is disturbing, brutal, and I liked it but not to consider it as a masterpiece. And I watched it with low expectations years ago when the exploitation craziness wasn't very popular. The production values are terrible but that helped to the reality factor. The movie looks very real and that makes it even more disturbing. I know that it's ultra low budget but that's not an excuse. The best thing in my opinion, is the brutal ending. Lots of good gore.Watch it only because there's a lot of hype surrounding it. You may like it or not but you need to accept that this isn't by any means a ""masterpiece"".",The Last House on the Left

43,Anonymous_Maxine,How did Wes Craven go from this to the Nightmare on Elm Street comedies??,9,1 December 2004,"I watched The Last House on the Left having only recently gone back and watched The Texas Chainsaw Massacre again and learning that I simply don't enjoy abrasive horror films like that. They are extremely well-made and very effective, but they are effective to the point that I don't find them all that fun to watch, the way I enjoy watching even the campiest scary movies. I also realized that there is a much more distinct line between horror movies and scary movies than I had previously realized. Horror movies, like Texas Chainsaw and Last House on the Left, are not scary, they're horrible. Conversely, scary movies hopefully are actually scary (although all too often they're not either), but are rarely horrible, mostly because excesses of gore and whatnot often render them campy, separating them from reality and allowing you to laugh while someone is being brutally killed.Last House on the Left is a horror movie, not a scary movie. It is not scary for a second, but the fact that it is presented in this almost documentary-like way and involves very realistic characters make it that much more effective. Given that I was so recently sickened once again by Texas Chainsaw, I was expecting something equally abrasive from Last House on the Left, which I decided to see after seeing an excellent documentary about horror film history called The American Nightmare.The movie was clearly a groundbreaking film at the time of its release, and you can clearly see throughout the film scenes that were influential to popular horror films that have come out over the years. I was reminded of some cheesy backwoods movies that also came out in the 1970s, like 'Gator Bait and the disturbing I Spit on Your Grave, which both have a similar feel to Last House on the Left, but oddly do not have nearly the effect of novice director Wes Craven's early film. I have a feeling that this may be because Craven had significantly less goofy caricatures in his movie than either of the 'Gator Bait films or I Spit on Your Grave, both of which are hugely overshadowed by Last House on the Left, which in turn was eclipsed by the classic Deliverance the same year. In watching the interviews with Wes Craven and producer Sean Cunningham on the DVD, it is clear that the movie turned out to be a lot more than they had expected it to, mostly because it was so disturbing that there were people who didn't want either of them to ever be allowed to work in film again, and it's not hard to see why they were so upset. More than 30 years later, the film remains effectively disturbing and upsetting, simply because it portrays real people doing horrible things to other real people. There are simple situations in the movie where you may find yourself wide-eyed with shock at something that could easily be created by a few people with a home video camera. The success with which Craven and Cunningham were able to make such an effective film with little to no budget ranks Last House on the Left with other low budget classics like Texas Chainsaw and Night of the Living Dead, although it now retains considerably less notoriety, possibly because of the lack of a whole line of sequels.I have to say that I really enjoyed the police officers in the movie, a sheriff and his deputy whose jaw-dropping stupidity surpasses even that of all of the law enforcement in First Blood. The campy gestures like the sheriff slapping his forehead and rubbing his chin helplessly at his inability to commandeer a chicken farmer's truck when their own car ran out of gas, gosh darn it. The comic relief is unusually starkly contrast with the rest of the movie, but it's a good thing it's there, otherwise the movie would be even more difficult to watch. While it's true that it is an uncomfortable experience watching the movie and I've recently decided I don't enjoy things like that, you have to respect the skill with which it was put together. Not just the level of depravity that Craven and Cunningham managed to reach, but the way they were able to come up with ways to put the film together when they had such limited resources. From a technical standpoint, the movie is a huge success because of that. Not quite as much fun as some of his later movies (and not quite as bad as some of his later movies), but Last House on the Left performs some things that remain almost unheard of in the movies, especially horror movies, such as the fact that it contains full frontal nudity and extensive and brutal violence, but glorifies neither. The simple fact that this movie can be as graphic as it is without being exploitative is enough to show that even after three decades there is still something to be learned from it.",The Last House on the Left
44,FiendishDramaturgy,What a Ride! Darkly disturbing documentary-stylized work.,7,30 October 2004,"Okay, so normally, I hate exploitation films. I've been through some trauma, and I hate reliving it. King of the Ants. Superb exploitation film. It had me on the floor, curled into a fetal position, looking for my ""happy place."" It was a wonderful movie which I hope to NEVER see again.Last House on the Left was this same kind of movie. It features abduction; rape; murder; psychological abuse; drug abuse; physical abuse; stabbing; dismemberment by chainsaw; dismemberment by knife; electrocution; forced g/g sexual acts; forced urination; suicide by a head shot; disfigurement; castration; and multiple sexual partners.When this movie was released, it was a more gentler age than today. Kids were literally puking in the theaters, passing out, and becoming traumatized by the material in this film. They devised a mantra, ""It's only a Movie, It's only a Movie..."" to keep everyone who watched it, centered and focused in the here and now, rather than burying themselves in the horror of this film. A necessary step for a society who was less jaded; and even some people today.The performances featured herein were gritty, realistic, and natural. Craven's documentary style lent to this work a specific realism which made it seem more like you were there watching it, or watching it on the news, rather than subscribing to the Mantra. It was highly provocative (in a BDSM kind of way), and yet at the same time, repugnant. Lines were crossed and bells were rung.No opportunity for villainous behavior was lost, making this a highly disturbing work.This film was not a ""masterpiece of horror,"" but it was a beauty of a little exploitation film, and has the virtue of being Wes Craven's very first. This is the movie that got Craven's director's cherry, as it were. *lol* This is not meant to be ""scary."" It was meant to disturb you; to crawl into your brain and make you react, however that reaction manifests itself. I must say, it definitely succeeds in its goal.This is a sure one for the collection, even if you're like me, and plan to NEVER watch it again.It rates a 9.2/10 on the ""B"" scale.That's a 7.4/10 on the ""A"" scale from...the Fiend :.",The Last House on the Left
45,Captain_Couth,"The Films of Wes Craven: The Ballard of Weasel, Sadie, Junior and Krug!",9,12 November 2003,"Last House on the Left (1972) is one of the most dark, twisted and frightening movies ever made. Shot on 16mm, the movie has the feel of a snuff film. Wes Craven set the bar high and only a few movies have even come close to it. Krug has to be the nasty villain to ever appear upon the silver screen. He drips with scuzz, sleaze and death. A depressing tale about how sick psychopaths are and how far people will go to get revenge. Craven and Cunningham revamp an old Swedish folk tale ""The Virgin Spring"" and give it an early 70's spin upon it, in the process they manage to create one of the most disturbing films in the history of cinema. Sadly, due to years of editing and mistreatment there is no definite cut of L.H.O.T.L. Many of these scenes were edited either by the distributors or the film-makers themselves. This picture launched the careers of Wes Craven and Sean S. Cunningham and created a cult star out of David A.

The storyline focuses on two teenage girls in the city that is trying to get out and have some fun and run into a guy on the street offering them some fine Colombian weed; and when they step inside to pick it up, that's the last time anyone saw the girls alive again. What happens to them is almost as entertaining as what happens to the people who dispose of the young ladies. This masterpiece is directed by the legend Wes Craven (Scream and a Nightmare on Elm Street) and stars Sandra Peabody (Teenage Hitchikers), Lucy Grantham (Loops), David Hess (Swamp Thing), Marc Shefter (30 Days to Die), Fred Lincoln (The Alter of Lust) and Jeramie Rain (The Abductors). This storyline is masterful and full of twists and turns and is just brilliant. The cast is also perfect and they all flow so well together. You can't say enough about the actors who played the killers. It's like watching a documentary in the look and feel and the intricacies of the characters.

48,MBunge,Just about the Alpha and Omega of modern slasher flicks,7,4 October 2010,"As one of the grandfathers of the modern slasher film, The Last House on the Left starkly demonstrates both the power and limitations of the genre. It's hard to call it a good movie but it's definitely not one you'll easily forget, even almost 4 decades after its creation.This is a brutally simple story. 17 year old Mari Collinswood (Sandra Cassell) lives with her parents in the heavily wooded countryside. For her birthday, she decides to join a friend named Phyllis (Lucy Grantham) and see a concert in the city. After the concert, the two girls run into a gang of vicious criminals, who abuse and degrade Mari and Phyllis in just about every way imaginable. They even throw them in the trunk of their car and drive out of town to do who knows what, but the car breaks down. So the gang takes Mari and Phyllis into the woods for more torture and suffering, until they finally kill them. The gang cleans themselves up and head to the nearest house to get some help and probably to rape and murder whoever lives there. The nearest house, however, is Mari's home and when her parents discover that their strange visitors have killed their daughter, they enact a revenge that is bizarre in its own perversity.This is a depraved movie. The violence of the story isn't that graphic by today's standards, where bodies exploding in a hail of blood and bone are fairly commonplace, but the relatively restrained and uncontrived nature of these violent acts makes them even more disturbing. The Last House on the Left doesn't make a big production out of its savagery. There isn't a lot of scary music, the scenes are all brightly lit and the imagery is neither manipulative nor voyeuristic. You don't even see some of the awful things done to the girls. The only truly theatrical elements of the story are when the film deliberately contrasts the horrific things happening to Mari and Phyllis with the normal and even happy things occurring with other characters. But it is the pure ordinariness of the setting and these people that make this movie genuinely unsettling.Everything else about the film is average at best. The dialog isn't exceptional, the acting isn't that good, the basic plot is nothing special, even Wes Craven's direction is okay at best. The power of The Last House on the Left comes from its uncompromising but non-exploitive, almost non-dramatic presentation of human barbarism. Most of the slasher flicks that came after this fell back on trying to shock and thrill you like a roller coaster, but this movie just wants to horrify you. It succeeds, but in doing so it proves how small and narrow the slasher movie is as a paradigm.They did a remake of this film and I'm sure it's like the other remakes done of Craven's early work. It probably looks better, sounds better, has better acting and more graphic and disgusting violence than the originalbut it's not as good and it isn't really as affecting. That's because you can only show so much depravity before you cross a line and become cartoonish. Behavior that becomes too violent and too degenerate, especially when presented with the high production values of modern film, ceases to resemble anything that has to do with human beings and becomes the equivalent of a Tom and Jerry cartoon or a Three Stooges short.In some ways, Wes Craven both created and ended the slasher movie with The Last House on the Left. He showed how compelling the genre can be, but I think time has proved that there's been very little left to do with the genre that's new or worthwhile after this film. The Last House on the Left is probably the most disgusting movie I'd ever say people need to see, because it is the simplest and most direct way to understand the slasher genre and the dynamic that has been pushing graphic movie violence ever since.",The Last House on the Left

What really hit me viscerally, and still did on re-viewing, was the sexual violence. This film goes (too far for comfort) for the gut-punch on rape, reveals the horror of it, even though it happens on our streets every day. Rape is truly a form of torture, and this movie doesn't pull many punches on that score.

50,kirbylee70-599-526179,STILL DISTURBING,7,9 July 2018,"I can remember the first time I ever saw THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT. I was drawn in by the ad campaign that claimed you had to keep telling yourself ""it's only a movie, it's only a movie..."" It was a great promo for the film and drew in those like myself who were pulled in as if dared to watch what would unfold on the screen. For once the hype matched the movie and it was more difficult to watch than I expected. More disturbing films have followed but this one released in 1972 was like a film that opened the door for those to follow. I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not.If you've never seen the film it's loosely based on Ingmar Bergman's THE VIRGIN SPRING (which I also recently viewed and wrote about). Mari Collingwood (Sandra Peabody) is a young girl living at home with her parents Dr. John Collingwood (Richard Towers) and Estelle (Cynthia Carr). She's going to a concert with Phyllis (Lucy Grantham), a friend her parents don't quite approve of. Before she leaves her father gives her a gift, a new necklace. The girls are on their way to the concert in a seedier part of the city when they come across Junior Stillo (Marc Sheffler). We as viewers are already aware of who Junior is, part of a gang of criminals who have broken out of prison. A description of them over the radio describes them as pretty much having committed every reprehensible act you can think of including murder and rape. The girls approach Junior hoping to score some grass and he invites them up to the hotel room he's in to sell them some. It isn't until they see the rest of the gang and Junior locks the door behind them that they realize they've made a mistake.The gang is led by Krug Stillo (David Hess), Junior's father and a totally scummy individual. With him are Sadie (Jeramie Rain) his long standing girlfriend and Fred ""Weasel"" Podowski (Fred Lincoln). It doesn't take long before the three of them begin threatening the girls. After a failed escape attempt by Phyllis she is raped and the girls remain hostages until the gang heads out the next day.Taken in the woods to be disposed of the gang, all with sadistic bents, force the girls to disrobe and make out with one another. Mari begins to go into a catatonic state and Phyllis is doing her best to cope with the gang and to help her friend. When they're done having ""fun"" with the two girls, the gang kills them and leaves them in the woods.At home John and Estelle had been planning a birthday party for Mari. When she never showed the night before they'd called the Sheriff (Marshall Anker) and he and his deputy (a young Martin Kove) arrived to get the details about the girls. The next day the pair find the abandoned car of the gang but can't get to help because their car runs out of gas. Having ditched the car with problems the gang heads out on foot and stops at a home to get some food and rest. What they don't realize is that this is Mari's home. They act peaceably enough not wanting to start anything that would leave a trail. Later that evening Estelle notices the necklace they gave Mari is now hanging from Junior's neck. What follows is less upsetting than the earlier moments of the film but no less unforgettable.The movie was the first film made by a college professor who went on to greater acclaim, Wes Craven. This was his first foray into film and was made on a miniscule budget as a way to get exposed to film. It was produced by Sean Cunningham who had worked with Craven when Craven synchronized his own directorial effort. Both would go on to bigger and better things, Craven to the Nightmare on Elm Street and Scream franchises and Cunningham to the Friday the 13th franchise.Craven has said that he wanted to depict the violence on screen in the film because prior to this the movies glamourized violence. He wanted to show the brutality of it and he accomplishes it quite well. The scenes of brutality in the film are very upsetting and to this day I don't recommend the film for those with a weak constitution. It's not that the violence is as graphically depicted with blood or gore as many of today's films are but the way its shot, the grainy near documentary styled shooting used and the scummy feeling of the gang and their behaviors leaves you wanting a nice hot shower after viewing. I think I first saw the film back years after it had come out. I can't quite remember of it was a midnight movie or a second feature at a drive in. I do recall that I didn't understand the acclaim the film had garnered and found it quite upsetting to view. I did stick it out though. Watching it again after all these years I still find the film unnerving and upsetting. I'm glad those in charge of making the film went on to bigger and better things. The same can't be said of all those involved. The film has developed a legion of fans in spite of the low grade production values and the disturbing nature of the film. It was banned in several countries upon release and sought after just for that reason. Those fans will be pleased to find that Arrow Video is offering the film in the best possible format available with a ton of extras. But that's become second nature with any and all Arrow releases.

If you're a fan then this is a MUST HAVE item. If you've never seen the movie go in wary and expecting to be shocked. Take breaks and walk away for a while if you must. If you're a horror fan then you'll want this as well. Arrow has outdone themselves on this release.Just to be clear I gave this release 7 stars because of the work put into it by Arrow Video for their release of the film. The film itself I'd drop down to perhaps 2.5 stars simply because of it's disturbing quality. But Arrow has come up with so much extra for the release I couldn't give it less than 4 stars for that reason.",The Last House on the Left
51,drownnnsoda,Sickness and savagery abound in Craven's realist grindhouse classic,9,1 June 2006,"To be honest with you this is probably one of the most brutal and disturbing mainstream films ever. ""The Last House On The Left"", one of Wes Craven's first movies, is about as nasty as realist horror gets. It is about two teen friends, Mari and Phyllis, who go out to celebrate Mari's birthday. While looking for some marijuana, they are kidnapped by a group of murdering bandits, are drugged, beaten, and taken out into the woods. These woods happen to be the same woods just 100 yards away from Mari's home. After brutally murdering both of the girls, they take refuge in Mari's parents' home, the parents unknowing of who the people are or what they did. When Mari's parents find out what they did to their daughter, they decide to take bloody revenge. Full of graphic images and in some ways clearly inspired by the cinematographic aspects of films like ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""The Last House on the Left"" has Craven at his most uncompromising and most brutal. The story is simple but well-written, and the characters are all uniquely shaped. The killers do terrible things to these poor girls, and you really feel sorry for them and wish that you could help, and their death scenes are absolutely horrendous. At one point one of the girls is forced to pee her pants— both are raped, forced to undress in front of the killers, and violently tortured until both of them meet their fates. Sound awful? It's beyond awful, it is downright sick. So why would I give this film such a high rating? Well, mainly because of how effective it is.The strongest thing about this film is that it feels so real, you could almost think it's really happening. ""To avoid fainting, keep repeating, it's only a movie, only a movie, only a movie"" - that tagline still applies to this day, because this film is that ""real"". The voyeuristic stance that the film takes in presenting these events as they unfold leaves you wanting to take a shower because you feel so dirty and emotionally drained. In that sense, this film is an utter success— it's an extremely low-budget, stripped down production, but the DIY special effects rise above this, and the straightforwardness of the violence is gripping. The acting is also incredibly realistic, particularly from the girls. Apparently the film was heavily cut because of its intense violence, but the new MGM DVD release includes the uncut footage and additional scenes that weren't shown back in 1972. To sum it up, this movie was sick, but in a good way. It's not the most pleasant way to spend 90 minutes, but this is a downright disturbing horror film, and therefore I have to give it a high rating - it is truly a landmark film in terms of its ability to relay human savagery in such a straightforward manner. It's an excellent movie and is a constant reminder of the wonders of low-budget cinema. If your idea of a brutal, realistic horror movie is Craven's ""Scream"", you'll be shocked at what he braved over two decades before that. 9/10.",The Last House on the Left
52,hu675,A Pretty good documentary style film-making debut by Wes Craven.,8,11 October 2006,"When a young teenager, who recently turned seventeen. Mari Collingwood (Sandra Cassel) is a easy going young girl on the verge of being a woman. Mari and her friend Phyllis (Lucy Grantham) are on their way to a rock concert but they find themselves been beaten, rape and torture by a group of sadistic crazed criminals (David Hess, Fred Lincoln, Jeramie Rain and Marc Sheffler). But these criminals ended up paying the price, when they ended up in one of girl's parents home in the woods for the night.Written and Directed by Wes Craven (The Hills Have Eyes, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Red Eye) made an brutal, realistic low budget horror film. Which it was controversial and grim, especially when the film was released in 1972. Which many critics consider to be loosely based on Ingmar Bergman's ""The Virgin Springs"". It is a film, i haven't had the chance to see it yet. This movie is notable for being Craven's first movie, some memorable songs by actor:Hess and strong moments of violence. The film's sense of humour makes this one less effective at times (especially an sub-plot involves two brainless cops). Craven's documentary-style film-making makes it powerful at some choice moments of dramatic terror.DVD has an good anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer (also in Pan & Scan) and an fine-Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono Sound. DVD features are excellent, including an joyful commentary track by the director and producer:Sean S. Cunningham (Friday the 13th), documentary with the cast & crew, outtakes & dailies and more. The newest Collector's Edition has all new special features. The video and sound transfer are the same. DVD includes an new running commentary track by Hess, Lincoln and Sheffler. DVD also includes three featurettes, deleted scenes (without sound) and an unfinished short film by Wes Craven. This new DVD doesn't have the features from the 2002 DVD Edition. Despite some real flaws, this picture is still worth a look, it has certain impact also. Especially those who are about to watch it for the first time, if you have the stomach for it. Craven also edited this one also. (****/*****).",The Last House on the Left
53,EVOL666,"Wes Craven's Rape/Revenge ""Classic""",8,9 February 2006,"I credit LAST HOUSE for being one of, if not THE first film to turn me on to a genre that has become near-and-dear to my heart - the Rape/Revenge film. Typically the story lines of these films have a woman (or in some cases more than one woman) who goes through some horrible rape experience, and either lives to take revenge on her assailant/assailants, or dies and is avenged by a friend, loved one, etc...These films tend to be brutal and realistic in their portrayal of rape and violence, and can usually securely be considered in the category of ""exploitation"" films.LAST HOUSE is about two young girls out for a night in the city. Along the way they go up to a guy and try to score some pot from him. To make it short, the ""drug-dealers"" (three guys and a girl) turn out to be escaped convicts. They abduct the girls and take them to the woods where they are then raped and eventually murdered after enduring some pretty strong humiliation. Unfortunately for the abductors, the woods where they took the girls are right by one of the victim's parent's house, and when the abductor's car breaks down and they go looking for some neighborly help - all hell breaks loose...There are definitely some inconsistencies and faults with LAST HOUSE - most notably the inclusion of some strangely out of place comedic moments - but as a whole, that factor doesn't really diminish the overall impact of the film. I also take into account the relative inexperience of Craven and crew during the production of the film. If I remember the commentary correctly, the film was commissioned as an ""opener"" for another film, and Craven and his cronies decided to make an off-the-wall horror film. Being that these types of strong exploitation-style films were just coming into being in the 70's and for the raw content that LAST HOUSE portrays - I feel this was a ballsy move on the filmmakers behalves.Highly recommended for any exploitation or rape/revenge buff - a definite must-see. 8.5/10",The Last House on the Left
54,JoeKarlosi,The Last House on the Left (1972) *,2,29 January 2013,"An amateur's ripoff of Ingmar Bergman's THE VIRGIN SPRING, incompetently shot and mostly incompetently acted. This is a terrible movie. And I don't say that because it glorifies rape, misogyny, torture, and killing... I mean because it's simply a terribly made movie, courtesy of a young Wes Craven (who would later improve for A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET). In a nutshell, two teen-aged girls go off together to see a rock concert but fall into the hands of a twisted group of loafers with no lives, three men and a woman. They bum around all day and get their kicks by torturing and then murdering these young females out in the woods. If that all sounds rather sickening for you, it all depends on your experience with exploitation films of this nature. When originally released in 1972, LAST HOUSE caused many stomachs to churn and even more protesters to pounce. If you're new at this kind of film today, you're likely to be just as offended. However, what was really extreme and over the top sleaze forty years ago does not always resonate these days, especially if you've seen many more of this type. I was too young to catch LAST HOUSE upon its release, but I think it's a film that has been weakened due to the passage of time. But I don't want to give this thing even too much backhanded credit; it's still poorly constructed and edited (especially in the print I saw, an MGM DVD released in 2002 which seems to contradict the manner in which one of the teenage victims had died), and poorly acted for the most part. An exception here might be David Hess, who plays the leading thug of the gang, and looks properly menacing and twisted. Hess also performed some of the soundtrack, which by the way is also lousy and interferes with the goings on. As does some ill-placed comical relief, dulling the edge that some of these atrocities might have had. The vengeful climax of the film should have been way more visual and in your face, but that too is a missed opportunity. George Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and Tobe Hooper's Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE show what two amateur directors with little money were able to accomplish with talent and ingenuity; both those films remain powerfully effective four-star classics of the horror genre today. THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT is just a piece of non-cinematic crap. * out of ****",The Last House on the Left
55,Witchfinder-General-666,Craven's Disturbing Debut Is Still His Greatest Achievement,8,7 September 2007,"Wes Craven's debut as a director, ""The Last House On The Left"" is an innovative, deeply disturbing, and overall vastly underrated film that I personally still consider this director's most original and important work up to date. The movie is, of course, unpleasant to watch at times, but the fact that it accomplishes to disturb (and often sadden) so deeply, the fact that it illustrates the sadism, brutality an insanity so realistically, is what makes ""The Last House On The Left"" special and, at times, brilliant.SPOILERS! - Mari Collingwood (Sandra Cassel) wants to celebrate her 17th birthday by going to a Rock concert with her friend Lucy. When looking for marijuana in the city before the concert, the two girls are forced into a house by a gang of low-life criminals, three men and one woman, lead by the sadistic psychopath Krug Stillo (David Hess). The girls are subsequently kidnapped to the woods, humiliated, raped and brutally murdered in some deeply disturbing, and saddening scenes. A while later the murderers seek shelter in the house of Mari's worried parents (Richard Towers and Cynthia Carr). When the Collingwoods find out who their guests really are, they are immediately determined to take revenge. Bloody, merciless revenge...At the point where the girls are murdered one is (or at least I was) so saddened and angry that the parents' bloody revenge comes like a relief. But although the parents' revenge is more than justified, the film is not necessarily promoting vigilantism, en contraire, it makes every effort to show brutal acts of violence as the disturbing acts they are.Some of the performances in ""The Last House On The Left"" are outstanding. Especially David Hess plays his role of Psychopath-par-excellence Krug Stillo with utmost perfection. Stillo is a character so brutal and abhorrent that even his fellow murderers are afraid of him. In one of the movie's most impressive scenes, Krug orders one of his accomplices, more precisely his own son (played by Marc Sheffler) to ""...blow your f****** brains out!"", at which point his terrified son shoots himself in the head. Sandra Cassel and Lucy Grantham also deliver excellent performances as the two young victims, especially Cassel shows fear and terror in a most convincing way. The parents, Richard Towers and Cynthia Carr, deliver great performances, as their despair, rage and desire for revenge is depicted in a very realistic manner.Apart from a few minor flaws, such as the ""funny"" scene about two dumb and extremely incompetent cops, which temporarily decreases the movie's seriousness, ""The Last House On The Left"" is a deeply disturbing and very original experience. Some people might fail to see that the fact that a movie is unpleasant to watch, does not make the movie bad. And this film is certainly not for people who are easily offended or sensitive when it comes to violence. It is beyond doubt, however, that ""The Last House On The Left"" is original as it is disturbing, and certainly not the everyday thriller people are used to. This may not be everybody's taste, but it is unique and uncompromising cinema that a true cineaste can not afford to miss! Highly recommended!",The Last House on the Left
56,caspian1978,Hidden Horror,6,27 October 2004,"Although the film has little gore / blood and has no monsters or supernatural beings like a Jason / Freddy / Mike Myers, the Last House on the Left remains one of the scariest films in its genre. 2 young and very innocent teenage girls decided to buy some 'weed' and end up falling pray to a group of ""bad kids."" The horror of the innocent becoming victims is the core of the movie. If not the corruption of drugs, the peer pressure / the influence of a few bad apples causes the destruction of good. More of a drama until the final 1/3 of the movie, the movie deals with (what may have been a true story) the kidnapping, raping and then the killing of the two girls. Once the parents have their revenge, the movie is far from anything of a horror movie, especially for 1972. The movie is a low budget triumph as equal to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The movie was something the horror audience had never seen before. 30 years later, it has become a classic.",The Last House on the Left
57,Jonny_Numb,"""Nice going, junkie, here's your yum-yum...""",7,3 August 2006,"""What the hell?"" If this wasn't the exact sentiment that crossed my mind after viewing ""Last House on the Left"" for the first time, it will be close enough for the purpose of this review. ""What the hell,"" I wondered, as I hit 'stop' and then 'rewind' on the old Vestron VHS rented from my local Blockbuster. ""What the hell was THAT all about?"" I was appalled, disgusted, and offended beyond belief. And hey, I'm the type of person who (more often than not) ADORES cinema that pushes the boundaries of taste with reckless abandon (at the time, my interest was heavily vested in the likes of Tarantino and ""Natural Born Killers""). But something about ""Last House on the Left"" barreled past a moral limit I had no idea I possessed and dragged it through the mud without consent. This was NOT the Wes Craven of the wholesome, critically-acclaimed ""Scream"" films (which I liked at the time, and still respect), but some low-rent hack who seemed to pride himself on all the shock tactics he could parade in front of a camera.Years passed, and something compelled me to give ""Last House"" another look (strangely similar to the way I re-appraised Craven's sophomore effort, ""The Hills Have Eyes""); in the meantime, I had become a novice viewer of the more well-known Italian horrors (namely Fulci and Argento), and my taste overall had shifted toward the obscure. This, I think, is why ""Last House"" clicked with me the second time around (though the passing of age might have helped, also); while I was previously a passive consumer of more mainstream horror, my newfound inclination towards the hidden gems of the genre energized my viewing. I WANTED to see something subversive, something appalling, something I hadn't seen before.Mari Collingwood (Sandra Cassel) is a free-spirited hippie girl who has just turned 17, the fine ripe age for rebellion; to celebrate her birthday, Phyllis Stone (Lucy Grantham) takes her to the city for a Bloodlust concert. In their search for some marijuana, they are accosted by a gang of sadistic thugs who staged a prison break earlier that day. Krug (the legendary David Hess), Junior (Marc Sheffler), Weasel (Fred Lincoln), and Sadie (Jeramie Rain) kidnap the girls, take them out to the woods after their car breaks down, and subject them to humiliation, rape, torture, and murder. While this template became popular among the low-budget exploitation films that would follow, it really originates with ""The Virgin Spring,"" Ingmar Bergman's tale of lost innocence, vengeance, and murder. That Craven chose this film as his inspiration is indicative of the higher intellect at hand, and the timing of ""Last House""at the tail end of the hippie era, and shortly after the Manson massacreis the perfect marker of a generation in transition.""Last House on the Left"" is as much a horror film as it is a juxtaposition of extremes in general: from gender roles to generational politics, the role of authority (here presented in a deliberately foolish and comedic manner), sexual awakening (and its subsequent degradation), and the clash of cloistered suburb against urban squalor. If the film is an amalgamation of a variety of different themes, then it is fittingif confoundingthat ""Last House,"" coming at the beginning of the '70s, plays like a grab-bag of cinematic technique. Like 1974's ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (or even 1969's ""Easy Rider,"" for that matter), ""Last House"" is an incendiary work that succeeds due to what it doesn't have; with such low budgets, these films were either destined for celluloid oblivion or cult classic status. Rife with close-ups, unknown actors, locations both gritty and rustic, shaky hand-held camera, and a picture that is often poorly framed (which was probably unintentional, but carries a grittily unprofessional effect that augments the reality of things), ""Last House"" shoves its intentions in our face, without shying away from the evil of which human beings are capable.Despite the fact that some of Craven's decisions (the inclusion of the police in particular) are questionable, he rivets us to the screen with a horror that, to this day, is still unnerving.",The Last House on the Left
58,vertigo_14,Better left alone. (spoilers),1,1 August 2004,"The Last House on the Left is allegedly based on a true story about the brutal murder of two teenage girls by escaped convicts out in the boonies.Basically, this movie is two parts. The first are the scenes leading up to and including the rape, torture, and murder of the girls by the four convicts. Sitting through this and watching about an hour of two girls getting raped and beaten and stabbed and forced to perform humiliating acts was not my idea of entertainment. I'd never want to be in a situation like this, let alone want to watch it. Sure, there are certain things in horror movies, but this is more like Wes Craven's attempt at amateur snuff. All we watch is the act of the convicts eliminating the girls, who they've taken out into the woods somewhere. It's really disgusting, and nothing else happens. It's not even like a horror movie and it's really sick to sit through. What was the point of exploiting brutal murders like that for cheesy entertainment? If that weren't bad enough, the rest of the movie is just awful. I know, it's 1972, and Wes Craven was not yet in his prime (pre-Nightmare on Elm Street), but this is bad even by bad horror movie standards. For one thing, the disgusting scenes of the girl's rape and murders are somehow celebrated with happy folk music. When the attackers all gather around one of the girls, including a scene where one of the attackers starts pulling intestines from the girl's wounds, they finish and all stand around looking at each other while some weepy song plays with lyrics about being ostracized from the world. What the hell is that?Then, there's these interspersed scenes of these two stupid Keystone cop types who might've been able to intervene somehow, but ignored that suspicious looking car parked out by the road. The scenes with the two stupid cops are funny, and the music is like banjo work that accompanies old silent film slapstick comedy. Where were the filmmakers going with this? In one scene, we'll be watching a girl getting stabbed to death, and then the next scene is the two stupid cops running out of gas and having to hitch a ride on a chicken truck? Disgusting.The finale is when the four attackers get their just deserts. With no help from the bumbling policeman, the parents of one of the girls, invites the four strangers into their home, thinking they're stranded traveling businesspeople. However, they soon learn that these are the people that killed their teenage daughter. So Mr. and Mrs. Suburbanite setup their house (and their attackers) for revenge. The ending is so drawn out and so completely stupid, it's not even funny. This was really one completely worthless horror movie. What a waste of time.",The Last House on the Left
59,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Visceral Terror with some Minor Flaws,9,31 March 2019,"This is quite an interesting film. This would actually be the first exploitation film I remember watching and one of the only films that my father put a restriction on me being able to see growing up. I've seen this film a handful of times and I still feel dirty every time I view this one. Before I get into that, the synopsis is two teenage girls head to a rock concert for one's birthday. While trying to score marijuana in the city, they are kidnapped and brutalized by a gang of psychotic convicts.As I alluded to above, this film is pretty brutal and makes me feel dirty with what happens to these two girls. We get to see Mari Collingwood (Sandra Peabody) as she is showering and getting ready to go out for her birthday. She is a new-age feminist when this film came out in 1972. She and her dad get into a disagreement about what she is wearing. She also mocks her mother and her beliefs on it. This film at the time was a modern retelling of a Scandinavian folk tale. There was a film version called The Virgin Spring. She is just entering womanhood while still being naïve and innocent. Her friend she is going with is a little rougher, Phyllis Stone (Lucy Grantham).Going from these, it seems to me that we have Mari who for the first time feels like a woman, but isn't fully there yet. I heard a podcast talk about this and it really helped me sync up with this film. She is going to check out a band called Bloodlust. She thinks that 'making it with them' would be like cotton or clouds. I don't think she really fully understands the world yet, but being the age that she is, she thinks she does.The group they encounter is led by Krug Stillo (David Hess). He just escaped from prison along with Fred 'Weasel' Podowski (Fred J. Lincoln). They were both in for violent crimes. They were broken out by Sadie (Jeramie Rain) and Krug's son Junior (Marc Sheffler). The latter is hooked on heroin thanks to Krug as a way to control him. It is interesting here that Sadie being the only woman shows some signs of empowerment that she won't have sex with any of them until more girls are found. She does try to say some things and it seems she is fairly well read, but she messes up some of the words. This is just fitting for what her level of education would be and even though she is well read, she doesn't fully grasp what she has read.Something else that struck me this time is the crime that Krug is serving a life sentence for. It was killing a priest and two nuns, which are religious figures. He is there for killing people that are generally considered to be 'innocence', which really makes sense for what they do later in the film.Junior ends up being approached by Phyllis when she is trying to score marijuana. They are then taken hostage where they are beaten, humiliated and raped. This starts at their place in New York, but then it moves to the woods near where Mari lives. Their car breaks down, stranding them. During all of this, we see that Krug and his group are just out to have fun at the expense of these women. We see they are forced to piss their pants, strip down naked. They also get violent with them. This is highly degrading and embarrassing for them. They then take the ultimate violation of their being by raping Mari. This is literally taking her innocence.This is showed with the duality of her parents, Dr. John and Estelle (Richard Towers and Cynthia Carr) as they are preparing for a birthday party for her. It is so ideal and normal, while these heinous crimes are happening. Things take a turn when Krug's group seeks refuge with her family. Her family learns what they did and get their revenge. I think this is edited together very well and the editing for the film is pretty good aside from this as well.Now I do have issues with this film. The bumbling police are annoying, but I do think that it was done due to the time the film was released. They needed something to take off some of the tension and that was what they decided to do to alleviate how dark this film goes. I don't think it holds up and actually hurts the film in the grand scheme of things.The ending of the film is cheesy a little bit. We do get the Wes Craven love of booby traps at home. I do think how Krug is punished though and who witnesses it is something that is quite powerful in my opinion. The whole ending sequence is good if they would have not gone cheesy with the traps. It is still satisfying I would say.Acting in this film was pretty good despite how amateur it feels. Peabody and Grantham I feel horrible about with the things that they endured. It does come off very realistic so I give them credit. I thought Hess, Lincoln, Rain and Sheffler were also good in their portrayal of the criminals. It really seems like they would go do the things that they did in this film. Towers and Carr don't come off completely realistic, but I think they were good enough. The cops were not good, but I don't necessarily blame them. I think it was the direction of what they were asked to do.The score of the film is hit or miss for me too. The Road to Nowhere song that plays was really good. It was written by Hess for the film and the words actually sync up to what is happening. Some of the others don't really fit the tone of the film while I think others work really well for it. There are some that are perfect though or give the duality of a scene, which really makes it interesting.Now with that said, this film isn't the easiest to watch. The subject matter and what happen is tough to stomach and no matter how many times I view it, it makes me feel dirty. This is a simple tale of two girls in the wrong place at the wrong time and taking their innocence away. You hope the parents get their revenge and it actually has a commentary on the police which is pretty relevant today. I thought the acting for the most part was good. The film was edited well. The soundtrack of the film does have some issues, but does feel very well in others. If you can handle this film, I do recommend giving it a viewing. If you can't, that's completely understandable. It is quite powerful in my opinion despite its flaws.",The Last House on the Left
60,nycritic,A Seminal Scream,8,19 May 2006,"I'm very divided as to how I feel about this movie. On one hand, if I look past the many mistake the filmmakers made and see the symbolism about a crumbling society at the familial level and the evil man can do to his fellow man, then it works. On the other hand, it doesn't transcend but wallows in its horror as if it's embraced it complete: the revenge-violence that literally explodes from the very protectors of family, instead of resolving anything, only complicates things.The DVD has Wes Craven giving his ""caveat emptor"" to the viewer. I think it's a little unnecessary but I can see why: having been hit so hard from all sides and being almost forced to disown having ever even done this movie it would be the only correct thing to do. It's as if the Marquis of Sade, had he been writing his controversial books in this day and age, would write a foreword where he would let even mentally open people aware that what they are holding in their hands is a potentially damaging book.LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT is an imperfect grind-house horror movie about two girls, Mari and Phyllis, who on their way to a rock concert meet a grim fate. The opening shot, of the mailman depositing Mari Collingwood's mail as we get flash-cuts of her emerging, virginal, from the shower while David Hess' mournful song ""The Road Leads to Nowhere"" plays like a forewarning, is great because it gives us a chance to see her in a near-perfect stage of her life when nothing could go wrong.Later on as both Mari and her friend Phyllis hit the road, we get mixed radio signals playing snippets of the songs featured in the movie, leading to a radio report of escaped killers. We're then introduced to these killers: when we see them, they're no more menacing than the Manson girls looked in 1969. I think Craven's choice of these amateur actors (among them David Hess in an ironic choice) was risky but it eventually paid off. Seeing how displaced and even childlike these people are, that in itself makes them dangerous.We get to see just how lethal they can be when their path dovetails with that of Mari and Phyllis, who are looking for their own way of momentary escape -- weed. It's clear something ugly is going to happen between these four people and it comes fast, but fast is not enough: a protracted torture sequence done in a cat and mouse relationship is sadistic to the extreme, as is near escape leading to a ferocious, ritualistic murder, and a horrifying rape scene shown up so close it makes us participants. And like the killers, we feel like we're equally horrified at what has taken place. When Hess fired his gun at Mari, it's almost a last chance at erasing his act, although like Hitchcock's horrific murder sequence in TORN CURTAIN, death doesn't come easy even in a placid lake.The reversal of LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT is sharp. The killers are looking for a place to stay during the evening and wind up in Mari Collingwood's parent's house. A dinner sequence is great in establishing a scene where these people have come together with no clue as to how their lives have merged and with the black background and sparse decoration seems an abstraction.My only problem with this portion of the movie is that once the Collingwoods learn of what has happened to their daughter they show no emotional transition, nothing to indicate the horror and agony they must feel -- after all, they've lost their only daughter. As a matter of fact, once they begin to suspect what we already know, they make no move to contact the proper authorities and I find that hard to believe that even in the early Seventies one couldn't file a missing person's report. Also, it would have been literally impossible for them to guess where Mari would be, apparently still alive according to the way she is still moving when we see her at the lake's shore, but this is probably an editing error or a plot hole or both. And anyway, logic sometimes doesn't add up in horror movies, especially in its ferocious denouement.From a cinematic point of view LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT is uneven. The introduction of the killers is at most bland, especially in the ad-libbed scene between Jeramie Rain and Marc Sheffler. The introduction of two cops (Martin Kove and Marshall Anker) and most notably their interaction with Ada Washington stops the movie dead in its tracks. The alternating cross-cutting between Mari and Phyllis as they meet their captors to their parents at home is that of clumsy editing but at least sets the film up for a rising sense of dread. The movie is best when it focuses on the escalating tension between the girls and the killers -- I couldn't but feel gut-punched when the two girls were ordered to take off their clothes, Sandra Cassel starts crying, and Lucy Grantham comforts her (which bulks up her character's importance and turns her into a heroine instead of relegating her to second victim).Wes Craven has with his movie a story that steps well past the boundaries of what you could show or not show in slasher movies. A sequence in which Sadie lovingly fondles Phyllis' entrails was cut and can only be seen in the DVD extras and maybe it's best. LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT has seen a revival in recent horror trends of showing people doing extreme things to other people and it's a sad legacy. I can't recommend it, but it's there, not a bad movie, not a good movie, but one that is extreme, hollow, and voyeuristic in the way it makes the viewer part of the horror, and caveat emptor to anyone seeing it.",The Last House on the Left
61,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A terrible birthday movie,1,15 January 2014,"Mr. Wes Craven is known for making a lot of controversial and inventive films. His most popular is A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984). And of course, like most famous directors, they start out somewhere. Majority of the time, their first attempt is either considered their best and most popular. Here, I don't know why or even how this film gained a remote following. There's nothing artful about this piece. It has no style or class and it makes you wonder how would this ever be considered entertainment.The story is about two girls who head out to celebrate one of their birthdays at a live concert. Little do they realize that along their journey they'll run into some very bad people. These people are described as jail breakers who have no sympathy for anyone. Unfortunately, when these two girls have their run in with these crooks, everything heads south from there. And that's for every aspect of the film too. First and foremost the actors who play the crooks in this movie are extremely frustrating to enjoy. They give no charm to their roles, but I will give credit where it's needed, audiences will hate these villains. That's not to say they were likable though - far from it.The actors who plays the girls and parents of one of the girl's are OK and will make the audience feel bad for them but that's it. They too don't give their respective characters something to really enjoy about. Perhaps by the final act some viewers may like how the characters react to various situations but by then it's too late. By the way, the actor who plays Junior Stillo (Marc Sheffler) looks like a 70s afro Shia LaBeouf. What similarities - not that I truly care for either actor.Then there's the whole violent element to the film. Is it full of gore? No. Is it heavy? Yes. Are the scenes kept classy? Absolutely not. In fact, many of the scenes are to the point of complete and utter filth. The main cause for this specific description is for the rape scene. Anything involving the action of rape is a serious downgrade in cinematic entertainment. It's one thing to imply it off screen or cutting to another scene, but it's crossing the line to show the action. It wasn't graphic but it's still wrong. Acting or not - that's not entertainment. I made this statement for both Evil Dead (1981) and its remake of 2013. It's not necessary. To see scumbags have their way with a girl will make audiences hate the movie more. Not appreciate it.Also, the cops in this film are lame. They show no wit or integrity either. Their job as officers are as lazy as their characterizations. Even stranger is how the title has nothing to do with anything. The title to this sounds like the story revolves around something inside the last house on the left. Not even, it's just the setting of where the final act takes place. Dumb. Lastly, the music is awful. David Hess the composer (also the scumbag rapist) couldn't even create one memorable tune. Most of the time, the music sounded like a video game. This made Joseph LoDuca's score to the original Evil Dead (1981) sound like a masterpiece. Along with that were horribly insertions of other songs from the time that sounded like hillbilly redneck music. It nowhere matched the tone of anything. Not even the trailer to the movie. Just terrible.The characters are not likable or intelligent, complete with a terrible story, trashy perverted violence and incomprehensible music. Avoid.",The Last House on the Left
62,Sandcooler,So delightfully weird,10,30 November 2005,"""Last House on the Left"" is just such a beautifully uncomfortable experience. The rather unknown actors, the hapless direction, the cheap equipment, the (I hope) deliberately butt-ugly cinematography, the brilliant soundtrack, they all add to the power of this low-budget gem. There are also some really bizarre dialogues involved, it's like here and there they're actually going for a bit of comedy. Intertwining brutal murder scenes with footage of a middle-aged couple baking a pie, I don't know why that's funny, it just is. The slapsticky police officers don't work as well, but they do add to the general ""what the hell am I watching""-factor of this movie. While were at it, the ""chicken lady"" crackes me up too, most random character ever. This movie is extremely rough around the edges, but in a whole other way it's also Wes Craven at his best.",The Last House on the Left
63,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,"Oh wow, disturbing...",9,11 September 2014,"Marie and her derelict friend Phylis are both a couple of teenage hippies heading out to a rock concert for Marie's 17th birthday (much to her parents' concern). While heading to the concert they stop in a bad part of town, are lured into a house when they try to buy weed, and get locked inside with three escaped psychopathic maniacs. Krug is the leader of the gang, a tall and menacing guy with bad 70's disco-style hair, always wielding his pocketknife. Sadie is the bisexual girl in the gang, and pretty messed up as it later on shows. Weasel is a prolific peeping tom, child molester and rapist. The only one in the gang who is not so much a murderer as just a guy being dragged along for the ride, is Junior, Krug's teenage son, who is addicted to heroin and sticks around so he can get it easily.While Marie's mom and dad frantically try to locate her, calling two bumbling police officers who aren't much help, the gang drives the two kidnapped girls out to the woods (coincidentally next-door to Marie's house), and start torturing the two girls, forcing them into all kinds of disturbing acts. When Phylis suddenly escapes and begins rushing through the woods to get help, Marie is left alone with Junior, who tries to help her get away but is unsure of what to do. Phylis is located by Weasel, who stabs her repeatedly, and Sadie pulls out her internal organs while Krug cuts her arm off, bringing it back with him to scare Marie. After he rapes her, she loses hope and wanders into the river, where she's shot to death. The killers dress in new clothes, heading to the next-door house pretending to be traveling insurance salesmen... unknown to them, the wife soon discovers from Junior what happened, and plans with her husband to avenge Marie and Phylis.As disturbing as much of this film was, with many graphic, gory and perverted scenes, there is a director's cut version that removes most of these scenes if you'd rather view it without them. Last House on the Left has a comedic side too, mainly coming from the two cops who go through many ordeals to track down the two hippie girls and the criminals, from boarding a truck of chickens to getting the bird flipped at them from a car of hippies speeding down the road. The soundtrack was pretty good, as was the acting. Being an early 70's film it has a lot of hippie stuff in it, from Marie giving Junior a peace sign necklace to the hippie-type soundtrack, the clothes the characters wear, everything. My only complaint is the graphic nudity, I love this film but I was fourteen when I first saw it and thought the two girls being forced to have sex on-screen was a little much.",The Last House on the Left
64,punishmentpark,"Partly legendary, partly amateur stuff.",7,6 September 2015,"An important film for the horror genre, but failing in several respects. The dialogues and acting are for the greater part below par, and the soundtrack is, especially in the beginning, pretty annoying. One or two hippie songs to underline the mood and state of mind of the two young females would have worked, but this is overkill. Then, there's the two bumbling coppers acting as if they are playing in 'The dukes of Hazard'. Wes Craven may have tried to make a point about the failing of police when it comes to cases like these, but he does not find the right tone of things.But, when the 'happy' music dies down and only a few somber, eerie tones sound through the forest and the actual debaucheries begins, the film really picks up. Even if I remembered the cruelties and gore to be more elaborate, this part is still pretty shocking and impressive. The best part of the movie - legendary, in fact.The results of the final confrontation between the parents and the wrecking crew is again rather variable (acting, writing, etc.); they (mom and dad) seem to just go their separate ways, leave lots of room for the rapists / killers to get away or even strike back. 'Somehow' things sort of 'work out' in their (mom and dad's) favour, but, for instance, when mom goes off seducing one of them in the woods (and...), it just feels way too contrived and far-fetched. Well, it's an exploitation movie, of course, but still.The middle part would deserve about 8 to 9 out of 10, but rest of it ranges from about 3 to 5 out of 10. I'm settling on a small 7 out of 10.",The Last House on the Left
65,Pumpkin_Man,A Beautifully Sick Brutal Cheesy Masterpiece That Has Become One of my Favorites!!!,10,17 July 2018,"I have seen this movie before a few times, and didn't think much of it but recently, I've become obsessed with it. Like, it's REALLY grown on me. I think I love it. I love the look of the 1970's. It's pretty tame and cheesy by today's horror movie standards, but that's what makes it so great and part of its charm. One minute, something terrible is happening, like forced rape or being stabbed to death, then the next, it's about two clumsy cops trying to find a ride. So, I bought the beautiful epic set by Arrow Video and I'm happy to see that Wes Craven's masterpiece directorial debut has received the Royal Treatment. There are three cuts of the film, which I watched all of them in one sitting. I wanted to see the differences and have it memorized before I re-watched the 2009 remake. (After watching the remake, I still love the original better. It's so iconic and an important piece of American horror cinema) The film is about 17 year old Mari Collingwood, who is about to go see a rock concert with her best friend, Phyllis. Mari is about to celebrate her Birthday. While she's gone, her parents, Estelle and Dr. John Collingwood prepare a Birthday party for her. While searching for some marijuana before the concert, the girls run into Krug Stillo, his son Junior, Fred 'Weasel' Podowski and the sexy but deadly Sadie. They take them into the woods and begin to sexually, psychologically, mentally, and emotionally torture them. The rape scene might've been pretty brutal back in the day, but the one figured in the remake is more graphic. By an amazing turn of events, Krug and company happen to seek refuge at the home of Mari's parents. When they find out who they are and what they've done, the parents will do the unthinkable to seek justice for their daughter. The parents become almost as psychotic as the bad guys, and that's something that fascinates me. In the beginning, they are normal boring parents, then later, the father is setting up traps and whipping out a chainsaw. To avoid fainting, keep repeating, It's only a movie, only a movie, only a movie, only a movie! I highly recommend THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT!!!",The Last House on the Left
66,BrandtSponseller,"A bit over-hyped, but fairly good and certainly important historically",8,9 July 2005,"While I think that people tend to get a bit hyperbolic when they talk about The Last House on the Left, I do think it's a fairly good film, especially given what the filmmakers were trying to do and considering their lack of experience, the era and the budget. Also, despite a filmic precursor, it just may be the earliest example of the horror subgenre of ""brutal, realist tragedy"" (that's more a description than a name, but I haven't spent much time trying to come up with a catchy moniker). However, it has flaws that would be difficult to overlook in a ""distanced"" (rather than ""objective"" or ""unbiased"", neither of which I think are possible) assessment of the film.The story, although claimed as true, is an adaptation of Ingmar Bergman's Jungfrukällan (aka The Virgin Spring, 1960). Roughly, it is the story of Mari Collingwood (Sandra Cassel). We see Mari at home with her almost-hip parents. Mari is about to head out to a ""Bloodlust"" concert in New York City with her new friend Phyllis Stone (Lucy Grantham). Mom and dad are harassing her about her clothing, which is thin enough to show off a bit of flesh, but they're not so un-hip as to make her change. Meanwhile, we learn from a radio that four convicts--""murderers, dope-pushers and rapists""--have just escaped from prison. At the same time, director Wes Craven slowly reveals the quartet--Krug Stillo (David A. Hess), Junior Stillo (Marc Sheffler), Fred ""Weasel"" Podowski (Fred J. Lincoln) and Sadie (Jeramie Rain). They're holed up in a New York City apartment. Sadie seems to be group property, and that causes some tension. It is suggested that they look for a couple more women. Mari and Phyllis end up at the wrong place at the wrong time. They're kidnapped, and mayhem ensues. But there's a twist that arrives when the convict's car breaks down in an ironic location.""Frightening"", ""disturbing"", ""sick"" and various other terms are frequently employed when describing Last House on the Left. Since I find no films scary, I can't vouch for the first term, but the other two would perhaps apply proportionate to how many horror films you regularly watch, and just what kinds of horror films. If you're not used to the genre in its grittier and gorier post-1960s instantiations, you'd likely find The Last House on the Left shocking. If you've seen a large number of films such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), Cannibal Holocaust (1980), Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer (1986) and so on, don't pay too much attention to the hype. You're not likely to be very disturbed by anything you see here.That doesn't mean that you'll not enjoy this film. After all, it has been a major influence on the films mentioned above--there is even an important chainsaw scene here. That's especially remarkable when we consider that it was only Craven and Producer Sean S. Cunningham's second film. They had been approached by a consortium of exhibitors who said that they wanted ""something as appalling and exploitable as Night of the Living Dead (1968)"".Maybe largely by accident, Craven and Cunningham (along with others, such as assistant producer Steve Miner, who later became much bigger ""names"" in horror--between these three, we have the helmers of a number of films in the three major 1980s/1990s franchises--Halloween, Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street) happened upon an unusual cinema vérité style that made the horrific situations depicted seem much more immediate and real. Combined with occasionally graphic and always intense situations of violence and control, the final effect is akin to watching a home video/snuff film. In fact, it was promoted as such in some areas, and the effect was disturbing enough in its time that the film initially received an X rating and was banned for many years in some locales.But again, focusing on that amounts to hype now, and shouldn't be taken too seriously, lest it lead to inflated expectations. Just as surprising on a first viewing is that The Last House on the Left has an intermittent goofy sense of humor and a ""groovy"" attitude that is firmly mired in the early 1970s. The two policemen are really comic relief characters (and very funny at that), but there is also a lot of humor surrounding the criminal quartet--this almost becomes a ""black comedy"" at times. These sensibilities even extend to the music, which has a frequent hillbilly edge and lyrics that supply ex-positional material. Surprisingly, Hess, who plays Krug, wrote the music.Despite the simplicity of the story and the fact that the 2002 MGM DVD release is the ""most complete cut ever"" according to Craven, there are problems with the story, whether due to the script or the editing. Too many segues between major plot points are ""jumpy"". The chase(s) through the woods seems a bit random. It's not very well explained how the convicts end up at a home looking as they do. Two characters find another who was missing, and it seems more like a dream sequence because of its arbitrariness, and so on.But overall, the story is effective enough. Although many subtexts can and have been read into the film, the most interesting theme to me was that it's largely a ""tragedy of happenstance"". Craven seems to be expressing a strong belief in chance and coincidence and focusing on the dark side of it. Under that reading, we can maybe excuse some of the narrative jumps more easily.Although there are a number of similar films that I think are better than The Last House on the Left, including Ruggero Deodato's House at the Edge of the Park (aka La Casa sperduta nel parco, 1980)--also starring Hess in a similar role, curiously enough, this is a must-see for serious horror fans because of its historical importance.",The Last House on the Left
67,baumer,"Without a doubt, the most disturbing film I have ever seen",9,26 June 1999,"I have seen some films literally dozens of times. They will remain nameless, but they are there. Some of those films are pure entertainment and have left an obvious mark on me. I have seen Last House on the Left four times. And there is no film that has left more of an impression on me than this film. It is a visceral experience and one that will never leave your subconscious, and that goes for anyone who has seen the film. There are images here that are about as primal as you can go without feeling like you are in a Neanderthal like state. Wes Craven has tapped into something that few if any have ever been able to duplicate. There have been imitations as recently as the summer of 2005 when Chaos tried to usurp LAST HOUSE as the most disturbing film ever made, but make no mistake about it. This is the one and only. This film still has an adverse affect on me. The only reason I rented this film back in 1992 was because I was convinced that ( along with Jaws and Halloween ) Nightmare on Elm Street was the one of the scariest movies I had ever seen. And when I found out that Wes Craven had an earlier film to his credit, I had to see it. What happened in the next 90 minutes can only be described as an assault on my senses. Everything that was good in life no longer existed and the fun and happy horror films like Friday the 13th were exposed as the charlatans that they were. It's not to say that they weren't fun films but they were not true horror films, the way a Steven Seagal film about war is a quack compared to something ominous like Apocalypse Now. I felt a plethora of emotions ranging from feeling sick, to shame, fear and trauma. I was so unabashedly disturbed after the film that a three hour, head clearing drive in the country was needed to calm my nerves. That is no exaggeration.The story centers around two carefree you women who are going to a concert in the city. They are looking to score some weed and they meet Junior, who promises them some and he takes them to meet the rest of the gang. What ensues over the next 45 minutes is nothing short of the dehumanization of the two girls. They are forced to beat each other, touch each other and then they are raped and murdered horrifically. There is not much more to say if you do not want to ruin it for those that haven't seen it yet.Was this a good film? Yes. Did I enjoy it? Absolutely not. It left me exhausted depressed and it drained me to the point that I thought I would break down and cry. For a horror movie to do that to me is quite astonishing. I have seen most of Fulci's gorefests but every time you see some guy with a drill through his head, you can dismiss is a schlock. You know it's fake. But not with this film. It imbues a realism to it that just makes you feel like you are watching someone's snuff film. It is that macabre and it feels that real. There is nothing else like it. I remember reading a review of Aliens by Roger Ebert and he said that the film was a work of art and he gave it high marks but the film was so much of a play on his emotions that he did not enjoy it. He was terrified more than he had been before. That is how I feel about this film. It is masterfully made, but it is a tough film to watch. Even after writing this review I am going to have a hard time getting the images out of my head. So my advice to you is if you are going to watch this film, proceed with caution. The subject matter in this film makes 8MM look like Anne of Green Gables.This is the first time the tagline has read so true. Just keep repeating to yourself that it is only a movie, it is only a movie......",The Last House on the Left
68,mentalcritic,"The answer is ""probably not""...",5,11 February 2005,"One previous comment I just read asks the proverbial question of whether anyone would care about this film if it had not been banned by several classification boards. The Australian answer to the MPAA, known as the Office of Film and Literature Classification, requires that any film be classified in order to be legally exhibited within Australia's shores. When The Last House On The Left was submitted for classification, it was met with a flat refusal, which essentially translates into a banning in simple terms. It has only been in recent years that Last House On The Left has been available for the Australian public to see, and it confirms my opinion that banning is one of the biggest favours a classification board can do a bad drama film.At its heart, Last House On The Left is a story about a bunch of escaped lunatics who abduct, rape, and kill two teenage girls who are on their way to a concert or something along those lines. Regardless of what these girls are doing, they never get there, as the villains proceed to put them through a gruesome execution. For sheer brutality, this film was upstaged by I Spit On Your Grave, but Last House has the distinct advantage of having likable victim characters. Indeed, the moment when one of the teenage girls is killed after seeming to resign and accept her fate is probably one of the saddest things I've seen depicted in celluloid. It is this scene on its own that earns the film much of its five out of ten rating.The weaknesses of this film are numerous. I don't know where director Wes Craven found the acting talent for this project, but it was clearly amateur night. No, let me scratch that. People say that the acting is poor in the original Nightmare On Elm Street. The performances of the cast in The Last House On The Left will make one wonder why Heather Langenkamp, Ronee Blakley and Amanda Wyss have yet to win Oscars. Keep your eyes open for a cameo from Jonathan Craven as the boy with the balloon, though. He also makes an appearance, albeit in a much different form, in Shocker. He is probably the best actor in this whole ordeal.And that is basically what Last House On The Left is. An ordeal. Every scene is stretched out past its welcome, every scene seems distended in order to stretch out the running time. What this film needed, in this writer's humble opinion, was a few redrafts in order to find something more substantial to fill out the running time. Not that this is totally without merit. Day Of The Woman, aka I Spit On Your Grave, uses exactly the same technique to pad out its running time to all of a hundred minutes. During that time, one begins to honestly wonder if this damned rape scene is ever going to end. At least Wes Craven has the insight to understand that only the most sadistic portion of his audience is going to want to watch more than ten minutes of such cruelty. At least Craven shows a good sense of time economy here, which is more than what I can say for certain directors who are more revered than they deserve.In all, this is a fairly passable early effort from Wes Craven. He shows that he knows how to elicit sympathy for certain characters, and he knows how to build a sense of tragedy. It would not be until later, during such efforts as A Nightmare On Elm Street that he would find the focus and awareness to make truly compelling viewing. This is a five out of ten film in this jaded viewer's eyes.",The Last House on the Left
69,mattymatt4ever,Thoroughly disappointing!,2,27 January 2003,"OK, so I was expecting a horror or slasher movie and I was wrong.  I can partially blame that on the misleading title (the house plays virtually no part in the movie and it's not haunted) and the misleading trailer.  But that's not the point.  As a thriller, crime drama, or whatever the heck it was trying to be, it failed.  I was simultaneously bored and rolling my eyes, dying for the film to end!  Even at a little under 90 minutes, it felt like an agonizingly long journey.The violence in the film is not pretty, but didn't bother me too much. And that's its problem, it should've bothered me.  The scene where the vigilantes make one of the girls pee her pants would make anybody cringe, but I felt too distant from the characters to actually feel anyone's pain. For God's sake, there's even a scene where one of the characters bites a guy's you-know-what off.  I should've been grabbing my crotch, yelling ""Ouch!"" but there was no tension leading up the moment.  The horrible score (which I can regard as one of the absolute worst in movie history) also has a lot to do with it.  Instead of eerie music to help build the suspense, the most violent sequences are set to corny 70's folk songs.  And after the movie's brutal ending, we're faced with a happy-go-lucky credit sequence. What kind of horror movie ends with a credit sequence like that?  I can also blame the film's effortless editing, in which the comic relief is timed very poorly.  After a horrific sequence, we cut to a slapstick vingette involving the two bumbling police officers.  It's like watching ""The Exorcist"" mixed in with an episode of ""The Three Stooges.""Wes Craven has made some damn good films.  I like the first ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" (not saying I don't like the sequels, but Wes didn't write and direct most of the sequels) and I enjoyed the ""Scream"" movies.  ""Last House on the Left"" is no sign of Craven's future genius.  It is a poorly edited, poorly photographed mess of a movie.  Definitely not a timeless piece of cinema, it shows it's age like crazy.  And I'm not just talking about the obvious signs like the dopey fashions and hairstyles.  The footage is very grainy and the zoom-ins are shaky.  As a matter of fact, the camerawork in general is very shaky.*************SPOILERS AHEAD****************The narrative is destroyed when the two sympathetic characters are killed off halfway through.  By then, who do we root for?  It's obvious that Craven now wants us to root for the parents, but you can't just shift the sympathy to a new duo of characters.""Last House on the Left"" is dull and completely lacking in suspense. Sure, the events in the film are credible and can occur in everyday life (Craven makes a good point in his commentary about in real life, people are tortured and killed without the benefit of a cutaway), but this is a film and it's supposed to tell a story.  A story that'll interest an audience.  Reality is everywhere.  Movies are depictions of reality.However, if you do buy or rent the DVD, there's a great commentary with Wes Craven and producer Sean S. Cunningham (who later directed ""Friday the 13th"").  So many directors give false praise for their filmwork, and make all sorts of pretentious statements that may have been in their minds when making their films, but they don't show up on screen.  There are several times where Craven actually mocks parts of the film, and admits that not all the scenes worked.  He has an incredible sense of humor (interesting that a funny guy like this is directing horror movies and unfunny bore like Wes Anderson is directing comedies), and jokes about how many of the actors don't want to be associated with the film.  He even makes a sarcastic statement aimed towards aspiring filmmakers, saying ""Don't make something like this.""  It's amazing how fascinating I found the making of the film, yet the film itself is so awful.  Ironic, ain't it?My score:  2 (out of 10)",The Last House on the Left
70,ODDBear,Important to the genre but is it any good?,3,27 October 2006,"Uum, what do you say about a movie that remains to this day one of the most controversial and shocking film to have ever graced the silver screen. It's pretty shocking in most all respects. Sure, the subject matter is gruesome, but so are the actors, the music and the ""humor"". This has ""Amateur"" spelled all over the place. Nothing looks to have been very competently made, just the sheer enthusiasm of breaking film boundaries and pushing it to the next level. The gritty and naturalistic look of the film is something director Craven prides himself most of and thinks of that as the primary source as to why the film was so shocking. Maybe horror enthusiasts today (like myself) have become so jaded that this stuff isn't all that shocking today. It does however have some of the most repugnant screen villains and one can't deny that David Hess does pull off his role with style (that's not to say his acting is convincing but he's got an undeniable screen presence). The humiliating mistreatment of the girls in the woods is an uncomfortable viewing experience to be sure but I do think I watched a censored version since some scenes described in other reviews where not to be found on the film I watched. It's just they look so fake, with some tremendously bad acting and I could easily think of the film's legendary tag line ""it's only a movie, it's only a movie..."". The ending, when the parents exact revenge, is so badly staged and executed that the intended impact does not come through. The inter cutting of the two bumbling cops as the girls are being molested show that Craven was still very much a learner, every possible momentum gets completely killed off. And that music is bad beyond words.What is immensely interesting is the story behind the film, almost worth buying the film all by itself. On most DVD editions the documentary ""Celluloid crime of the century"" is available and that's much more interesting than the film itself. Craven and producer Sean Cunningham are proud of the film but the actors have diverse stories to tell. In the end Last House on the Left is a film that had a huge impact, remains a cult classic and a boundary breaker, the subject of endless discussions on what could or should be allowed to portray on screen and for that reason alone it's existence is very welcome. I may not like it but it can't be denied that it's important in the horror genre.",The Last House on the Left
71,KnightsofNi11,Too many things just don't work,3,23 November 2010,"Here we go with another horror movie from the notorious 1970's. I seem to have been on a streak of good or at least decent films of this genre, but sadly, The Last House on the Left ended that streak. The movie is about two seventeen year old girls who are kidnapped by a band of four sadistic murderers and rapists while trying to score some dope. They are violently terrorized, raped, then murdered. Afterwords, the awful gang of people decide to take some temporary refuge in a lovely country house which happens to be the house of one of the girls they just murdered. Violence and terror ensues, but not to much extent. This movie tries to hard, yet at the same time doesn't try hard enough.The entire editing of the film seems shoddy and careless at first, but I soon realized that the director, Wes Craven, was trying to give the film a sort of claustrophobic and sinister feel with the snappy and often times strange cuts. However, whatever he was going for was not achieved in my eyes and I was left with something that just didn't feel right. Perhaps with some more finite tweaking to the structure and editing of the film it would have worked out, but I'm not here to judge the ""what ifs"" just what I saw on my TV screen. There were some other technical issues that begged me just a little bit, such as a couple of characters whose voices were overdubbed very poorly. I often times don't mind this because it gives the film a strange and independent feel, which works in its own strange way in other low budget horror films like Evil Dead, for example. But here it was just distracting.Probably the biggest issue with The Last House on the Left is its characterization. The film really has four sets of characters, the two seventeen year old girls, the two parents of one of the girls, the four murderers, and two police officers. Each group is either underdeveloped or poorly designed. The film starts without establishing much character, but we do feel a sense of close family ties between the daughter Mari and her loving parents. Yet through the rest of the film the development seems to come to a halt, thus during the gruesome rapes and murders, I didn't feel as much sympathy as I should have. I'm not saying I didn't have sympathy because that's not something that's hard to achieve when you are watching two innocent characters get beaten, raped, and then murdered.At the beginning of the film the parents were developed about as much as the two girls were, and I definitely got a sense of what they were all about, but it didn't go much further from there. Then at the end of the film the parents go on a violent revenge spree against the people who murdered their daughter, and this practically comes out of nowhere. There's no time to develop these hard hitting emotions that these two empathetic characters are experiencing. Instead we jump straight into revenge without any warning. In hindsight, this could work in some way, but it's not too important to dwell on because the girls and the parents are the strongest of the four groups of characters in this film. The problems really arise with the last two groups.The band of four murderers are not doubt disgusting and vile people, who we are obviously supposed to despise with every fiber of our body. This isn't something thats hard to do, but the major problem with these characters is just how ridiculous and foolish they are. They're a bunch of buffoons and some of their interactions are almost comical at times. There are times when they feel utterly harmless because of how idiotic they all are. It's this that completely removes the sense of danger we are supposed to feel emanating from these horrid people, and the film loses all of its claustrophobic and ""all hope is lost"" feel. At this point it becomes pretty boring as opposed to scary.Finally we have the two police officers who are hired by the parents to find their missing daughter. These are two of the most useless and idiotic characters I've seen in a movie. Every one of their scenes is a slapstick act that isn't even funny. Their roles in the film serve no purpose. Even if they were intentionally utilized to be the comic relief of the film, which seems pretty ridiculous in a horror film like this, then they even failed on that level because instead of a laugh or even a chuckle, all they received from me was an ashamed palm to the face gesture, otherwise known as facepalm.The Last House on the Left could have been good. Hell, it could have been great. It has the right elements, and because it doesn't deal with the supernatural or paranormal, it is something that could actually happen to somebody as innocent as the girls who were murdered in this film. But unfortunately it misses the mark with poor visual decisions and bad characters that couldn't at all keep me interested in this film. There are a dozen other 70's horror flicks that I would recommend before this one, so avoid it and go re watch The Shining.",The Last House on the Left
72,ivo-cobra8,Wes Craven's good first early movie off an psychological thriller,6,1 November 2016,"This is Wes Craven's first movie off an psychological thriller from the 70's. I am doing originally Wes Craven marathon and I re watch some of his early work movies that I haven't seen before. So I start by this movie The Last House on the Left from the 70's, Wes first movie and I can say it was a good movie, but I don't like and I have a problems with it. This movie is the most disturbing rape/revenge movie I have ever seen. It is definitely not my favorite Wes Craven movie, it is not a classic or Wes Creven's masterpiece like some reviewers wrote that in the title, but it is really good to watch on it is own way. I want to make my top 10 Wes Craven favorite movies and some guy on YouTube said this is his favorite movie. Sadly it is not mine and I don't like it. There are some elements and things that I did I liked about this movie and I am going to start talking about the things that I like.Things I like: The acting in this movie is really well human acted from everyone. Sandra Peabody and Lucy Grantham acted really humanly realistic and they well portrayed their characters Mari and Phyllis. Lucy Grantham for me was incredible she humanly acted brilliant her character Phyllis Stone as the victim. She was very brave and a caring heroine in this movie, even tough she died on the end, I absolutely love her character.Sandra Peabody as Mari Collingwood was emotional and very caring girl with a heart that she left a remorse on the viewer. I was rooting for those two girls, than I would be rooting for the psychos which I did not!Wes Craven did an excellent job writing the script for this movie and the dialogues for the characters. He made a job well done directing for the first time.The rape scene in the woods in which Mari and Phyllis are naked and they had to make out was my favorite scene in which Phyllis is cheering Mari from crying and she try's to calming her down. That was old school acting and one of my favorite scenes in the movie.I love the scene in which Phyllis Stone character was forced to urinate her self that was very realistic performed, this is my favorite scene.Sandra Peabody acted her character humanly and she well acted perfectly as the victim Mari I love her.Everyone from the actors acted believable, especially the villains that have turned in to psychoses were amazing and brilliant.Martin Kove from The Karate Kid (1984) is in this movie and his character was likable. The cops in this movie were more caring about the missing girl than catching those escaped convicts. No one want's to drive two cops to Collingwood estate, which could happened in real life.Mari's parents report the missing of her daughter right away and they were making a birthday surprise party for her which it has a heart and soul in this movie.I liked the exacted revenge on the crooks by the end of the movie: John set's booby-trap's on the crocks. I love how John kills with a chainsaw Krug - - bad-ass scene I like it.David A. Hess, Fred Lincoln and Jeramie Rain as the villain's did and excellent job portraying their characters and I love them so much in this movie. This movie is fast paced, short at 1 hr and 24 Min's. Is not boring or over long it is entertaining and I have enjoyed watching the end of the film. Those are the elements I loved in this movie.Things I don't like in this movie and they are unnecessary: I don't like the rape scenes in this movie they are disturbing. I don't like the torture on those two girls. Sadie and Weasel stabbing and cutting Phyllis arm was horrible and disturbing.No one mentioned Phyllis Stone by the end of the movie not even the psychos or Mari's parents, she was forgotten that shouldn't have been!I hated the scene in the river in which Krug is keep firing his gun on a poor Mari I hated that scene! The punishment and the death scenes on the three villains exacting from Mari's parents were awful! They could have been executed way better. The booby traps could have exact way better in this movie.This movie is terrible shoot with the camera, even for the 70's horror film the picture quality were terrible. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Carrie movies are way better shot with the camera than this low budget film is.I hated Texas country songs and I hated the humor putting in this movie.I can only give this movie a 6/10 I can not give this movie a higher rating, because the movie wasn't that good. The rape and stabbing scenes are scary, disturbing and very terrifying.R.I.P. - Wes Craven (1939 - 2015) I really miss you and thank you for all the Freddy movies, thank you for all horror franchise and movies. Thank you for all your work Wes. I love you so much I wish you could done more horror movies, I really love them.The Last House on the Left is a 1972 American exploitation horror film written, edited, and directed by Wes Craven and produced by Sean S.

73,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Before the massacre in Texas there was...,6,20 March 2007,"...Wes Craven's first feature film.Two girls head out to the city for a night out at a concert. Unfortunately for them they run into some recently escape lunatics and are savagely raped and murdered. In an ironic twist of fate the escape criminals must stay someplace over night which happens to be one of the girl's parents place...This film has everything you'd expect from camp and shock horror. Since it is one of the earliest, if the the earliest, of its kind it probably originated many of the elements that horror film freely splatter about today. It is brutal and hard to take even by today's standards and that is due to lack of over doing things. The killers don't really look like killers, they look like people - they're sick in the mind not in the face. In fact if it wasn't for what they did they mind as well be regular day to day people, maybe a little eccentric, but then who isn't? It is this point that ultimately sticks when you realize that the typical person is potentially capable of some truly sick and twisted s**t.However, the film does lack a certain punch in that most horrifying thing doesn't come at the end, which it really should. The biggest gouts of gore are in the middle so the kicker ends up being hardly a nudge. Maybe it's because Wes Craven, and everyone working on the film for that matter, were rookies. In addition the film creaks rather slowly in parts which is fine, but there is little atmospheric build up and the film ends up being a lot less cinematic than Craven's next feature ""The Hills Have Eyes"" or ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" However, overall it is a good film for devoted horror fans to watch, but others steer away. --- 6/10DVD is unrated with violence, gore, brutality and rape. Not for the faint of heart.",The Last House on the Left
74,mario_c,"Wes Craven, I must say it: the beginning of your career was not as brilliant as I thought!",5,27 January 2010,"Disappointing, very disappointing! After watching the 2009's remake I was very curious about the original THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT because I found the remake a very good film with a very credible plot, nicely built characters and most of all I found the movie pretty realistic. Well, here, I guess it's all on the opposite side! This movie is totally unbelievable, on a bad way! I know it's a very dated production and we can't compare the way movies are produced nowadays to 1972's productions. Of course it's pretty different. But I'm giving it some discount on that way! I mean I scored this film 5/10 just because of that, because if it was a nowadays production with such cheapness I wouldn't score it higher than 1/10, that's for sure!!! Unlike the 2009's remake which have a solid plot, with a very credible development, that made me think: ""What the Hell! That could happen in the real life"", and all the characters were pretty realistic and well built to their ""function"" in the movie, here nothing of that happens! The plot developments are hardly justified, some characters look funny when they should be rude and scary (I'm talking about the thieves, of course!), the screenplay is unbelievably cheesy, with some terrible lines; I mean the only justification to that is if Wes Craven wanted to do a disturbing and funny movie at the same time!!! If not, why the thieves look so pathetic and no frightening at all; why the policemen look so dumb either (with that little music piece that looked so close to the DUKES OF HAZZARD music – I know this movie is previous to that series, but you know what I mean...) and why all those cheesy lines in the screenplay?! It's an ""Hippie-horror"" that's the only explanation I can find! That was the only feature I can say I appreciated in this film, the hippie ""background"" of the plot. I mean maybe at the time nobody noticed because it was normal to that age, but today, watching it almost 40 years later, it tastes good that hippie stuff!:) The scene (at the beginning) when MARI is arguing with her mother about her bra, or the band she would see at the concert that killed a live chicken on stage, not to mention SADIE that also seemed to be a convicted feminist! LOL! It was funny to watch all those stuff, proper at the time, in a movie. Not to mention the music, which was very nice too; not appropriated to a supposedly disturbing movie, but very nice! Well, in fact, aside from that, I was very disappointed with this film because I was expecting something much better, especially after watching the remake. I saw many people telling that the remake was better (and that isn't so common to happen) but I never thought it would be such a difference! The remake is really too much better than the original in all possible ways. Not because it's a more recent movie and have a better production (of course!), but essentially because it's pretty more realistic! Wes Craven, I must say it: the beginning of your career was not as brilliant as I thought! I score it 5/10 taking in consideration it's a dated production, otherwise it would be 1/10 as I said before",The Last House on the Left
75,TheOtherFool,A disappointment,4,6 July 2004,"I always wanted to see this movie sometime but now I did it's a slight disappointment. The movie's about 2 girls getting humiliated and killed by a gang of 4, who just happen to spend the night in the house of one of the two.Revenge flick starts of really silly with some corny dialogue, strolls along very slowly with some chases in the woods, only to end with a silly fight between the gang and the parents. There's even a chainsaw involved here, don't say I didn't warn you!Only powerful scene is when one of the girls has to wet herself so that her friend won't get killed. Hard stuff to watch, for sure. But overall it ain't as ground-breaking as I Spit On Your Grave, so I'd advise you to see that one instead. 4/10.",The Last House on the Left
76,acidburn-10,Wes Craven's Debut,7,9 May 2007,"The infamous ""Last House On The Left"" which is directors Wes Craven's first outing. It's easy to see why this movie caused a lot of controversy back in 1972 because to be honest you have to have a sick mind to think up an idea like this, I'm not saying that this is a bad movie but it's something that you can watch over and over again especially if you have a weak stomach.The story line is about 2 young girls Mari and Phyllis travels to the big city to see a rock concert but are stopped in they're tracks by Krug and his crew and end up being kidnapped, tortured, raped and even murdered.After watching this movie seeing a pair of likable teens going through a long process of being tortured and raped was unsettling and I definitely saw the raw emotion and it's powerful effect and sense of realism, knowing that this can really happen which is frightening and disturbing.As it's Wes Craven's first film he was definitely spot on at creating something that shocked the world and making his mark in Hollywood and at the same time nearly ruined his career, but gladly it didn't. I wouldn't say this is his best movie, to be honest he's made some great movies such as (The Hills Have Eyes, A Nightmare On Elm Street, The People Under The Stairs and Scream) and even some bad ones such as (Deadly Friend, The Hills Have Eyes 2 and Cursed), well even great directors can't get it right every single time, but I'd say he got it right with this one, but it's not one of his best because it's so disturbing. The actors are dead on in this movie, the 2 girls Sandra Cassel (Mari) and Lucy Grantham (Phyllis) were both believable and gave ballsy performances, David Hess (Krug) is amazing as the murderous leader. His calmness gives an extremely scary performance, very effective, Fred J Lincoln (Weasel) is perfect casting, he looks like a weasel, a charming one at that. Love that jackknife bud. Jeramie Rain (Sadie) plays the sick twisted bisexual killer perfectly and Marc Sheffer is excellent as Junior, the heroin addicted youth.All in all I'd say a very ambitious first effort from the great Wes Craven.",The Last House on the Left
77,emm,Wes Craven's first effort remains disturbing to this day.,7,23 December 1998,"Another depressingly guilty pleasure in my book!LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT isn't really supposed to be a horror film, but it's a highly disturbing, perverting, and graphic fictional account of murderers decaying precious life. The no-holds-barred advertising campaign made it perfectly clear for those who had the strong will to go see this picture: ""CAUTION: To avoid fainting, keep repeating, it's only a movie...only a movie..."". They're right! Fans of Wes Craven movies will be disappointed that it's not a high-quality production, and has some low-budget acting routines, but its purpose is strongly effective on a true-to-life point of view. It does compare to a horror film in terms of gore and frightful ways, and the folk music score is an amazing surprise. Look for a young Martin Kove (KARATE KID movies) as a sheriff. Disturbing as it looks and sounds, it's a first, and well done, masterpiece from Craven & Co. Let's hope a ""remastered special edition"" video release comes around. One of those movies that deserved a long awaited viewing!",The Last House on the Left
78,qormi,Extremely amateurish - even by high school film class standards.,1,26 March 2012,"A bizarrely stupid mess. Edited for comedy, not horror. Extremely inappropriate comical music throughout. Yes, straightforward depictions of violence against captive women, but done in amateurish fashion with unintentionally ridiculous actors. After the last victim is dispatched, the film disintegrates into absurd foolishness, reminiscent of an early Woody Allen film. Seems like it was done on a shoestring budget with only one shoestring. How Wes Craven found work after this debacle is beyond reason. It seems as if a few friends got together one Saturday with a video camera, had a few beers, had people in it who never acted before, and had a good time. Pure trash.",The Last House on the Left
79,the red duchess,Craven's masterpiece,8,6 December 2000,"This delightful black comedy is so harrowing because its tone is so hilariously flippant.  Long before 'Scream', Craven was engaged in analysing the fundamentals of horror - audiences, expectations, representation, ethics.  To find a film featuring extended and graphic scenes of torture, rape, mutilation and murder 'delightful' is to ask a lot of hard questions about yourself as a viewer, maybe even as a person.  it's not enough to say 'Craven made me', as he juxtaposes a horrendous gang raping of a teenage virgin with the bumbling exploits of two comedy cops; a number of people left the cinema, and made their choice.  So did I.The story is a remake of Bergman's 'The Virgin Spring', adapted with surprising aptness to the backwoods of post-hippie America.  Birthday girl Mari and her friend Phyllis go to see metal band Bloodlust in a 'rough' neighbourhood.  At the same time, a pair of ruthless killers have escaped jail, hooking up with their moll and the leader's junkie son.  Mari and Phyllis, eager to 'score' some 'grass' (man) on this exciting night of new-found independence, ask a loitering Junior Stillo if he has anything. He invites them into the killers' hideout, and the ghastly horrors begin.Right from the beginning, the tone of this film is almost jauntily comic, from Mari's parents' (sometimes sinister) fuddy-duddy routine, to the news description of the escapees.  This comedy comes from a number of sources, from exaggerration, incongruity, or just the sheer strangeness of people with these delicious faces saying certain things.Craven goes to great lengths to compare the two families in a very Bergman way, from the pets they both share, to the generation tensions.Initially, the film had seemed like a reactionary moral lesson - a young girl in the first flush of her burgeoning sexuality, her bosom finally developing, goes to a violent concert in a dodgy neighbourhood, without a bra - isn't she just asking for trouble?  This is classic, reactionary liberal-baiting - her parents, despite their token protests, are children of the hippy ethos; father even gives Mari a CND necklace for her birthday. Mari leaves the safe cloister of home for freedom and the big city, and is punished for it, a victim of the women's lib Krug so despises.Craven sets this up because it makes us feel safe, it gives us a position, recognising as we do contemporary films on a similar subject, eg. 'Dirty Harry', 'Death Wish'.  BUt when he brings Mari back home, playing out her destruction in the heavily symbolic forest, we realise that his appropriation of Bergman isn't superficial.  Although the film seems to be that perennial theme, the external threat to the family, Craven shows that its roots are within, in Mari's fairy-tale sheltered upbringing.  So remote that the phone doesn't even work; friendless until a year ago, Mari's only confidante was her mother.Mari is 17, and yet she is only hitting puberty now.  This biological suppression, this unnatural delay finds an outlet in violence - the violence done to Mari, to the family, the home, the wood, but also the film's form, which veers so wildly in tone.  .Craven isn't the first horror director to take inspiration from Bergman, whose terse narratives are full of terrors unavailable to the generic director.  He lacks Bergman's stern, parable-like concentration, but the transplantation from a mythical, Protestnat, symbolic space is effective, and Craven's style is full of low-budget inventiveness.  Another possible influence is Godard, in the way Craven flagrantly shocks in the disparity of his content and the way he expresses it - the 'horrifying' denouement is pure farce, a routine of assorted vaudeville turns.Like Godard, one could argue that his progressive experiments are undermined by misogyny - it's always the spectacle of terrorised women that is used to 'subvert' or 'expose' something or other.  It is about times somebody took their cue from 'Deliverance'.  What is certain is that the term black comedy should never be used so lightly again - a film like 'Heathers' or 'War of the Roses' can never disturb a viewer as disturbingly as this.",The Last House on the Left

Later, after the parents of Mari find out that they are dead they vow revenge on those that killed them.A vicious, cold-hearted and dark look into the nature of crime from writer-director Wes Craven who made his debut movie with this shockfeast. This movie caused a fuss when it premiered in 1972 despite being a hit, the film nearly got an ""X"" rating but was cut for a bit to earn an ""R"" rating but audiences nearly faint at the sight of this motion picture on it's realistic nature. David Hess steals the show as Krug whom is one of the most unlikable baddies to ever grace of the horror screen, the film was produced by a young Sean S. Cunningham (""Friday The 13th"" and ""House 1986"") and the film was condemned by most critics as trash except Roger Ebert whom was brave enough to sit through the picture.

It's disgusting and at times horrible to watch. But it isn't the most violent horror movie I've seen. The major problem was that there were a few major annoyances that really spoilt the mood of the movie.One was the very annoying music that played throughout. It didn't set up a good mood or a sense of dread, it just made the scene seem like nothing. Another was the added comic elements that really broke the mood, which although weren't too distracting, were not funny and annoying. The acting was passable and Wes' direction is perfect.I would recommend this to the hardcore horror fans.

82,Nightman85,As brutally shocking now as it was in 1972!,10,27 December 2005,"Horror master Wes Craven made his directorial debut with this violent, low-budget film that became a landmark of modern horror.A gang of sadistic criminals kidnaps and tortures two teenage girls, but little do they know, they'll be spending the evening with one of their victim's vengeful parents.For all it's budgetary limitations, Craven's Last House on the Left is a film with the undying power to shock and disturb. It's a film that explores a different kind of terror, the darkness that can exist within the human heart. This film is completely merciless in its violence and that is the strength behind its impact. Last House' is a truly gruesome show that is not at all for the faint of heart or stomach. Craven took what materials and actors he could find and made the most frightening and horrific movie he could. Little did he know what its effects would be!For such a shoe-string production, the cast is surprisingly strong. David Hess is probably best, as a ruthless and powerful leader for the cruel gang. His performance is solidly frightening! Cassel and Grantham make fairly believable victims, it's easy to feel sorry for them. Fred Lincoln is perfectly sleazy in his role as a gang member, while Jeramie Rain is genuine in her sadistic madness. Marc Sheffler is effectively sympathetic as the reluctant son of Hess.The Last House on the Left was the first bold mark in Wes Craven's long career, and will probably always stand as one of the most unsettling films of the exploitation genre.*** 1/2 out of ****",The Last House on the Left

84,loganx-2,"""Tonight were gonna go see Bloodlust.""",8,9 July 2007,"My girlfriend thought I was watching 70's porn, which admittedly the film does resemble at times. It's basically a remake of Ingmar Bergman's The Virgin Spring, accept the rape and torture are the centerpiece's, the revenging parents far more sadistic, and the religious message eliminated. Light seventies folk pop dominates as the score which gives the film an eerie detachment as do the constant edits between the mundane activities of sheriff and parents to those of the victims in the woods nearby. The acting is poor, the story obvious, leaving only the violence which is extremely graphic even by modern standards. Whether or not this is enough to make the film watchable is a matter for the tastes of horror fans to decide. Personally I found the whole thing a bit anti-climatic, the fight scenes being particularly poorly staged. Still an important film in the history of horror, but aside from buffs, scholars, and sadists, there's not too much worth watching here for the casual viewer. Of course if your a little of all three this film is one to watch, especially for those jaded horror fans who feel they've seen it all.

87,malkane316,QuicK Reviews!!,7,28 April 2005,"Over 10 years before Elm Street began, Craven was already creating fear, disgust, invention and controversy, particularly with The Last House on the Left, a notoriously banned film which, like most banned films is graphic more in theme than content. For its time though, it was heavy stuff, rape, murder, mutilation, torture, sadism, revenge, chainsaws...The film begins calmly enough, with two teenage girls going out together to a rock concert, we watch them getting ready at one of their houses with one set of parents telling them to be careful, have a good time etc. However, after looking for pot before the concert the girls are kidnapped by a group of sadistic escaped criminals including Krug, the leader, and his apparent girlfriend Sadie. The girls are then raped, tortured, and eventually killed in brutal ways. Craven directs these scenes so that they are almost unbearable to watch even though we don't see much, and the performances of the cast are excellent. Even after the deaths the killers seem to realise what they have done and there seems to be some sort of confusion in their eyes, if not remorse. Then in a Bergman-esquire twist, the killers' car breaks down and they look for help at a nearby house which just happens to be the Collingwood home, where the parents of one of their victims live. They have called the police as their daughter has not returned home, and unwittingly invite the maniacs in. Soon though each group recognises the other, and the parents go about their bloody revenge using a variety of dentistry and home improvement tools to full, gripping effect.Like The Hills have Eyes, it is fascinating to watch how a middle class family with strong values etc can quickly become executers when provoked, to see how any person can become a monster in the 'right' circumstances. There are no happy endings here, no moral justification, just revenge pure and simple. The film is set up in every way to disturb, from the infamous trailer, the Texas Chainsaw style 'based on a true story' effect, and the scenes of torture and murder themselves. Krug and co. and thoroughly evil and take great joy in the pain of others, but they quickly change face when bearing down upon a gun or chainsaw. The film is almost entirely grim and grainy although there are some funny moments involving the cops and a chicken farmer. There is some average acting, and it will be too unbearable for some. This should definitely be seen, but do not be expecting a bright affair, you will be uncomfortable throughout.7.5 out of 10",The Last House on the Left

I mean, I Spit on Your Grave (1978) was much much better and showed story properly with good amount of violence.I don't know what work the editor was doing, used inappropriate comical music throughout the movie taking away the tense tone movie was trying to make. The whole story was executed poorly, thanks to the director and ridiculous actors. After 40 minutes of movie, rest 50 minutes is dragged unnecessarily.

It was clear to all the teens that this trashy film was simply made to throw a few shivers into us. Seriously, the packed theater was roaring with laughter at the horrible acting, lousy screenplay and obvious violence. The show became a word-by-mouth cult film ala Night of The living Dead, and I must have seen this "" trip down trash lane"" about a dozen times. Shocking? You've got to be kidding!

90,squeezebox,A Masterpiece of Non-supernatural Horror,10,12 February 2003,"Wes Craven's unfairly maligned masterpiece of non-supernatural horror is as disturbing and gut-wrenching today as it was thirty years ago. Instead of picketing theaters and banning the video, parents should have been making their teenage daughters watch this movie--they would never try and score pot or stay out late again! The gritty, documentary feel of the movie adds to the tension, and the likability of the characters makes us empathize with them more than the usual exploitation trash. Even the killers are given three-dimensional, intriguing personalities, which makes their acts far more unsettling. Jason and Michael Myers are basically killing machines, with no conscience to temper them or motive to drive them. Krug & his gang of outcasts are thrill-seeking thugs, who resort to violence almost without realizing they're doing it, and suffer faint pangs of regret when the carnage is over.One of the most revealing sequences in the movie is the rape of the virginal character Mari. Krug undoes her belt and yanks her pants down, as the camera focuses voyeuristically on her pelvis. As soon as her bare legs and underpants are revealed, we cut away to Junior, watching helplessly. We then cut to side view of Mari and Krug from the waist down. We can see that Mari still has her shirt on. The sequence then cuts to a close-up of Mari and Krug's faces, Mari staring emotionlessly into space and Krug huffing like an animal. Why do I find this particular sequence so important? Because it reveals this movie for what it truly is: a psychological character study. In a lesser exploitation movie, the threesome would have ripped off all of Mari's clothes, and she would have cried and carried on as Krug had his way with her. The fact that Krug doesn't bother removing her shirt signifies that he wants to do this quickly, it's the obvious next step. Mari's submissive expression is far more disturbing than relentless screaming would have been, because we can actually see all the hope and desire to escape drain from her face. Afterwards, Krug gets up, Mari walks off and vomits. Krug looks away, ashamed, as do the others. It's as though they suddenly realize that their two minute thrill is a devastating and life-altering event for Mari. When Krug shoots her down, it almost feels like an act of mercy.After these emotionally shattering moments, the bloodbath at the film's finale is a most welcome catharsis!Perhaps the ultimate horror movie tackling the human race's infinite potential for violence and depravity, LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT is an intelligent, underrated and misjudged classic.",The Last House on the Left

An Excellent,Powerful,Disturbing Horror Classic From Wes Craven.",10,6 January 2016,"The Last House On The Left is one of the greatest Horror films ever made,an excellent,powerful and disturbing film that combines fine direction,a good cast and a memorable soundtrack. All of those elements make The Last House On The Left a Horror classic that is Wes Craven at his best.The Last House On The Left tells the story of Mari(Sandra Cassell),a teenager who's celebrating her 17th birthday by going to a rock concert with her friend Phyllis(Lucy Grantham)in New York City. While in the city Mari and Phyllis are looking to score some marijuana but get kidnapped by escaped convicts led by Krug(David Hess)which lead up to terrifying results.Released in 1972,The Last House On The Left is a brilliant Horror film that not only marked the directorial debut of director and Horror master Wes Craven but is also one of the most controversial and infamous Horror movies ever made. Disturbing,brutal and sadistic all around,The Last House On The Left is film that caused a stir the minute it opened in movie theaters in 1972 thanks to it's now famous movie poster and trailer tag-line(""to avoid fainting keep repeating it's only a movie,only a movie"")or the violent nature and was even banned in several countries and no matter what it will always seem to divide critics and audiences some will love or hate it some will see it as a Horror classic or a piece of trash there seems to be no middle ground. Regardless how you feel about the movie The Last House On The Left is up there with Night Of The Living Dead(1968)and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre(1974)in giving audiences a different kind of Horror movie and is one of the finest Horror films of the 1970s that you will never ever forget and if A Nightmare On Elm Street(1984)and Scream(1996)are Wes Craven's most famous films then The Last House On The Left is his most notorious. With The Last House On The Left Wes Craven has crafted a movie(which was made on a low budget of just 87,000$)that's rough around the edges and is an exploitation movie to the hilt but is a film with a raw and striking power that punches viewers in the gut with fright and terror that just comes off the screen at viewers. With Last House we given a movie that isn't easy to watch but is gripping from beginning to end and offers no salvation or positive outcome and while the film isn't scary Last House is a disturbing and unflinching look at violence,murder and pure evil. The atmosphere and tone in Last House is grim and bleak with a style that is sleazy,ugly and morally corrupt with a documentary feel as if you right there watching all the horrific things going on which makes the film feel realistic. Last House also gives viewers a look at the tone and feel of late 1960s early 70s Nixon era:Vietnam,The Manson Family Murders,Hippies,The Watergate Scandal and the violence during those times told in an angry and violent way. And speaking of the violence,in Last House the violence in the film is not for the weak at heart or people with can't stand violence because the violent scenes are mean spirited and vicious showing human beings at their most horrific. Craven would bring the same darkness and brutality to his later films such as A Nightmare On Elm Street and Scream but it all started here but make no mistake about it Last House is not a Slasher film. I guess that's why Last House has some Comedic scenes before,during and after the violence scenes to lighten the mood. The main characters in the film whether it's the bad guys or other main characters are actually interesting and well-developed with memorable lines and scenes. The ending of The Last House On The Left is amazing,effective and goes along with the theme of violence throughout the whole movie. A great conclusion.The cast is great. Sandra Cassell is fantastic and believable as Mari,with Cassell bringing depth to the role. Lucy Grantham is wonderful as Phyllis,Mari's friend. David Hess is excellent,frightening and unforgettable as Krug,who in my opinion is one of the greatest villains of all-time. Fred Lincoln is great as Weasel,Krug's right hand man. Jeramie Rain is incredible as Sadie,the lone woman in Krug's group. Marc Sheffler does a fine job as Junior,Krug's drug addicted son. Richard Towers(as Gaylord St. James)and Cynthia Carr do good job as John and Estelle Collingwood,Mari,parents. Marshall Anker(Sheriff)and Martin Kove(Deputy)are funny as local lawman.The direction by Wes Craven is good,with Craven basically pointing and shooting bringing a documentary look to the film and keeping the film moving at a solid pace. Fine direction,Craven,RIP.The score by David Hess is terrific,offbeat,haunting and fits with the tone and mood of the film. Great score,Hess.In final word,if you love Wes Craven or Horror films,I highly suggest you see The Last House On The Left,an excellent,disturbing and unforgettable Horror classic that you will never forget. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",The Last House on the Left

I saw it once a few years ago and will never see it again. Even the equally vile I Spit On Your Grave wasn't as disturbing as this. For me, there is not one redeeming feature about this movie...zero.

It's sad more generational movies like this aren't made in our time.The brutal kills would have been much more effective if they were shown on screen, but I understand in the time they wouldn't have been allowed. However, the ideas themselves are a lot more unnerving than ""I've seen that a hundred times"" gore like you get in movies like The Midnight Meat Train.If not for Alien, I think I would call this the definitive horror film of its decade.I'm not sure what else to say. It's just a freaking fun movie that defies almost all the clichés of the typical kidnapping/vengeance movie, as well as keeping characters a lot more interesting than the copy/paste of most horror today.Forget The Mist of The Decent or whatever typical horror you plan on renting, get this.4/10",The Last House on the Left

98,happyendingrocks,"Hideous, depraved, and essential",7,2 September 2010,"Let's not mince words here, Last House On The Left is shocking, hard to watch, and one of the few films that earns every bit of its infamy. This movie is less a piece of escapist entertainment than a ruthless assault on the viewer that will severely test even the most seasoned horror fan with its bleak, misanthropic exploration of the darkest recesses of humanity, its sickening displays of brutality, and its unflinching realism. Even those who giggle with fiendish glee when presented with over-the-top splatter set-pieces (I'm not judging you; you're among friends) will find it extremely difficult to stomach the deluge of horrific scenarios that arise throughout the film, and I'll even go a step further and recommend that if you do have a smile on your face when you finish watching this film, you should probably seek professional counseling.Of course, everything I've just stated about this film is precisely what makes Last House mandatory viewing for anyone who considers themselves even a casual fan of the genre.Though often categorized as an example of grind-house exploitation at its finest, Last House actually bears little thematic resemblance to anything in that canon. Whereas exploitation films are generally meant to entertain their audience, Last House On The Left seems more interested in making its viewers uncomfortable by presenting a series of atrocities that force the audience to question why deeds so horrendous would ever be construed as entertaining, and to turn a mirror toward ourselves as we wonder why it is we cannot look away. There is nothing exploitative about the inherent maliciousness of the violent acts in this film; this isn't entertainment, this is an example of just how ugly violence truly is.The plot is simple enough: a pack of loathsome killers kidnap two young girls and put them through a gauntlet of torture, humiliation, degradation, and eventually murder. When the homicidal group seeks shelter, they inadvertently find themselves in the house belonging to the parents of one of the girls they've killed. When the parents discover what their house guests truly are, and what they've done, they get revenge on the killers via a series of horrifying acts that rival anything we've seen our villains undertake.Nothing new here, just a simple revenge plot whose origins can be traced back as far as Shakespeare (or The Bible, if you want to get technical). It's what Wes Craven does with this sparse plot thread that makes Last House such a unique and disturbing film.The primitive camera equipment available to this budding auteur adds immeasurably to the presentation, and Last House more resembles a documentary than a Hollywood offering. This heightens the realism of the vile deeds we see carried out, and serves as a haunting reminder that there are actually people as twisted as Krug and Company among us, and that the terrible things we see in the film happen far more often that we like to think about.Craven also solicits unnervingly spot-on performances from his cast of unknown actors, each of whom essay their roles perfectly. As our central antagonist, it isn't surprising that David Hess's Krug is one of the film's focal points. What is surprising is how strong Hess's portrayal is. It must be maddening for Hess to forever face the existential quandary borne from the precision of his performance: Krug is brought to vivid and menacing life in a way that clearly displays that the actor playing him has serious chops, yet the role is so well captured that it would be impossible to picture Hess playing anyone else but Krug. To have one's career made and ruined with the same movie must be a nightmare, but Hess can sleep soundly knowing that even if Last House were the only film on his resume, he's made an indelible mark.It's worth noting that Craven's handling of the rape scenes in the film are remarkably restrained. Unlike the thematically similar I Spit On Your Grave, which seems to revel in its misogynistic undercurrent by making sure that we see every step of the sexual violence, Last House is far more effective because of what it doesn't show. The use of sound during the first rape scene and the heart-wrenching close-up on Sandra Cassell's face when she endures Krug's assault later in the film tell us volumes more than the 45 minute barrage of nudity and brutality that anchors ISOYG. There is nothing gratuitous on display here, and even Cynthia Carr's notorious fellatio dentana scene during the climax is more squirm-inducing because of a clever camera angle that makes us think we're seeing more than we are.Certainly, the film has flaws. The editing is spotty at times, and some important elements in the film are left beyond our understanding (how exactly do the parents stumble across their daughter's body?). The comic relief segments with the sheriff and his deputy are simply awful, and instead of relieving the tension as intended, these scenes pad the running time with pointless filler that slightly dulls the impact of the gruesome activities that comprise the core of the film.But, notice I said ""slightly"". There's no getting away from the fact that Last House On The Left is one of the most powerful films ever made. Despite its glaring flaws, this is a stunning debut from a director who would go on to define and redefine the horror genre at least twice in his career. Yes, it's uncomfortable to watch. Yes, it's sick and morally abominate. But isn't ""horror"" supposed to horrify us? Last House On The Left does this in ways that no ever film has, and in ways that will be impossible to get out of your head no matter how many times you repeat, ""It's Only A Movie... It's Only A Movie... It's Only A Movie...""",The Last House on the Left
99,ryan-10075,"Dark, Disturbing, Docu-Style Horror Flick and Craven's 1st",6,20 January 2021,"Wes Craven's first film is guaranteed to not be for all tastes or all viewers. Still to this day almost 50 years later disturbing and at times hard to swallow.It is Mari Collingwood's (Sandra Cassel) birthday, so along with her friend Phyllis Stone (Lucy Grantam) is going to the city to see a concert. Looking to score some drugs on the way they ask junkie Junior Stillo (Marc Sheffler) if he might know where they can get some marijuana. He brings them back to his apartment only for the two teenage girls to meet one of the worst, vile and disgusting gangs in film history. Led by Junior's father Krug (David Hess in the stand out performance of the film) they kidnap, torture and rape the two teenagers. In their escape from their hideous acts they end up back at Mari's house for a final confrontation with her parents (Gaylord St. James and Cynthia Carr).I really can not imagine what the reaction to this film was like back in 1972. Not saying it was the only film to ruffle any feathers, but writer/directer Craven and producer Sean S. Cunningham (who would later go on to direct FRIDAY THE 13TH) were deliberately trying to show the audience something new no matter how vile. Because of that this film should stick with you.Do not expect amazing acting. Not to say that there is brutal performances that hamper the film, but really the performances that stand out to me are of the villains in Krug, Fred Lincoln as the aptly named Weasel and Jeramie Rain as Sadie. Hess is quite believable as the venomous gang leader. Almost too good. He also did the music for the film which is pretty good and shows that Hess had some talents.Super low budget horror flick did quite well at the box office. It is also filmed in a documentary style by Craven that to me is really a wonderful low-budget style to show this real grindhouse type material to an audience.Sadly there are things that do in fact hamper the film to me and bring the rating down a notch or two. The big one to me is any of other characters in the film like the dolt cops (including a young Martin Kove) really bring the film down. Their scenes while comedic just don't work for me. They really rip you out of the horrific scenes, which maybe back in 1972 Craven felt they needed to do that to give the audience a break, but it would have worked much better if it was perhaps a more relentless horror film.In the end though, a must-see for Craven fans. Steve Miner who went on to direct some horror films in his own right like FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 2 AND 3 worked as assistant editor (with Craven who edited) and production assistant.",The Last House on the Left
100,Chaves7777,And you... are... Alone.,8,27 July 2007,"As probably says above, please, if you don't want to spoil this movie, don't read this commentary... here i describe some important things for the plot.Wes Craven has created one of the most famous characters in the horror cinema history, Freddy Krueger and made ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"", which, for me, one of the most original horror fantasies in the 80s. Then he made ""Scream"", which have 3 parts, and too direct the seven part of the ""NIghtmare"" series (The original and this semi kind of sequel are the only effective in the series). In the present, he made a serial of horror movies, without count with the drama starring by Meryl Streep ""Music of the Heart"". But before of all this, he made ""The Last House on the Left"" ... a movie that was and is attacked as repulsive, disgusting and sick.""The Last House on the Left"" told us the story of two girls. Mari Collingwood, who birth just 17 felt like a woman for the first time. At the same day, 2 fugitives who are dangerous scape from where their intern. Mari lived in the last house on the left, far from city. Mari and Phylliys, her other friend go to a bad famed neighborhood for some grass, they asked to one man ... They don't know the error that commits. ""The Last House on the Left"" is first of all, a confusing movie, but most of all, a shocking one. ""The Last House on the Left"" was in that and still in our own time, a polemic movie, with followers and haters. I don't think that this movie can called as excellent, and great, but i have it an admiration, because this is a powerful film, that i actually find terrible and repulsive, but not so disturbing as much say. ""The Last House on the Left"" is based in a film years before by Ingmar Bergman called ""The virgin Spring"", which plot is very similar, only that is located in a different time and location.Much says about that this is a repulsive film and sick film and much says that this is one of the best horror pieces ever. This two ideas go wrong and is about and idea: This is not none of that things... ""The Last House on the Left"" is a shocking and powerful drama.But ""The Last House on the Left"" have some mistakes that make that we don't get the real objective of its creators and at the same time this get confused and make that much judge too fast this movie. The plot have include with it some funny characters (Two cops) and that makes lose any seriousness. Another mistake is the develop of some things, for example in the last part of the movie, the development of the feelings of the mother and the father is not know for us at all. And the movie then come so quickly after the climax... Well, could be much better in this point. Other important point is the confuse objective of this movie. Was really created by Craven and producer Sean S. Cunninham (The future director of ""Friday the 13th, for that reason this make me doubt) for make only sick people? It was a sensationalistic piece with no any meaning more than disgust (As ""Cannibal Holocaust"" for example)? The only thing that supports this idea is the first title apparition which tell us that ""The Story is based on true events"" thing that i don't think that is true. But ""The Last House on the Left"" can have one different objective after all: The fright of real monsters. The fright of the pain of a person that we love so much. The idea of revenge (Manage too in ""Carrie"" and ""Irreversible""). So, this is the reason of why this film should not be judged so quickly. Why appreciate this film in the end? Is because the film is not so sensationalistic as much going to think, if the intention was make a real fright about real monsters, this movie get it. I think that after all, the movie is graphic, but not so much for say that Craven was making a disgusting film and that its creator is sick. I think that if Craven wants to make tremble of fear in an intelligent way, he get it. I think that this is more a psychological horror drama full of a coldness air. And in spite of that terrible mistakes, this is a movie that should be seen and take slowly. Always get fast in opinions makes that we say things that don't go with it. A thing that support this idea is the music, which was made by Alexander Hess (Who played the evil Krug). The songs is one of the few vehicles to makes know to us the real feelings of the characters (""Wait for the Rain"" describes the upcoming storm for a father and a mother). The folk music is wonderful and terrific, although that sometimes is bad used when a kind of funny music is put it in wrong scenes (When they kidnapped the girls put a kind of clown music... the only reason that i can found for this is that could be a cynical message, if the villains feels happy for their new criminal adventure).""The Last House on the Left"" is destinate to be a film which cause controversy and each viewer going to take it good or bad, as they think what was the real objective. I have seen the capacity of Craven to do films, and i support him (Althoug that i have read somewhere that he feels how hard have been this film).

Early in the movie, there is a scene where a father takes exception to his daughter's lack of a bra. He says, ""You can see her nipples right through that top."" Was this so bad?

103,shepardjessica,Real Suburban Fright!,7,5 July 2004,"I remember seeing this one at the drive-in in upstate New York (beautiful as it is in the daytime, come Sundown - it's a scary back road home).  I guess people this semi-gore flick was loosely based on Ingmar Bergman's The Virgin Spring from the late 50's, but it was done on a mocassin-string budget.  The actors in this were a combination of Jerry Springer show, bad Quinn Martin productions, color Jerry Lewis imitators, and a few folks who seemed to actually BE THERE.  This blows away The Hills Have Eyes (well-done) in terms of ""IT""S NOT REAL, IT'S JUST A MOVIE WITH NO STARS IN IT"" semi-exploitation plot, but it actually delves into human psychology on a primate form that reliquishes the semi-nude/slasher/rebel format into a Rod Serling world of ""what next?) Very frightening, surpisingly non-""bloody"" terror motif plot-wise, but spins (the music forewarns you of sanity on it's way) into a morality tale with bite.  Almost a docu-drama of suburban paranoia combined with white-trash bad-drug addictions clashing into a fairly normal outcome (despite the abuse of some young people early on).This movie does not condone or exploit violence in a way that, even in the 70's, ANYONE WOULD ENJOY the horror part of this creepy tale, but you do pay attention once a creep turns their back on you (in an, unfortunately, realistic way).  Anyway,  this film got it's cult status deservedly, which at the time I never thought would happen.  This movie disturbed me 30 years ago for the wrong reasons.  It's all too POSSIBLE now, which makes it scarier than any horror movie even attempts to tackle anymore.  Check it out.  You won't forget it and you won't want to see it too many times, but you will remember it in a way similar to NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and a few others for scary non-acting realistic fright.",The Last House on the Left
104,Afracious,A low budget black comedy with some shocks,5,17 March 2001,"Where to start with this film. It's amateur, which can be blamed on the budget. The editing and camera work is pretty shoddy. But you don't watch the film for that, you view it with the intent on seeing the notorious scenes of torture and murder, not the side show of silly bumbling slapstick cops and poor acting. The problem with the film is the two girls. They are not convincing. They don't emit any fear. And the killers don't seem as convincing as the ones in, for example, I Spit on your Grave. Krug is the most threatening of them all. The others are a gaudy guy with a knife, a wimpish junkie, and a ditsy bimbo.It's an amazing coincidence how the killers take the girls in the trunk of their car to a desolate location, that turns out to be adjacent to one of the girls' parents' house. And the killers then later stay the night there. The parents revenge on the killers is quite amusing. I watched this film in a theatre that was well attended, and there were plenty of laughs. Some of the lines were amusingly memorable, one of the killers named Weasel saying, ""I can make love with my hands tied, I'm so super."" That line got a lot of laughs in the theatre. I'm not saying this is a bad film. It's one of the unusual films that can shock us (and the scenes where the girls are killed are disturbing) but also amuse us in the next scene. I compare this film with Herman Yau's The Untold Story, which is a far better film in my opinion, in the way it combines shocking violence with humour. To sum up, a shock/funny film worth watching, and it's criminal the film is still banned in the UK. It seems no worse than The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which is now available in the UK.",The Last House on the Left
105,erwan_ticheler,"Strange and full of holes, not Craven's best work",6,6 October 2005,"Last House on the Left is a very strange and brutal film that exploits the dark side of human beings. There are several gruesome scenes in the film (for instance when one of the girls is forced to wet her pants. It is said that this film is in the style of Texas Chain Saw Massacre, a very weird argument since this film was made 2 years prior to Tobe Hooper's classic horror masterpiece. Sure,it has the same rural terror but to call it a TCM kind of film is not right.Last House reminded me very much to Straw Dogs made,in 1971.That film has the same idea since it is also about so called civilized people who are forced to act like animals when they are under severe threat.The booby traps set in Last House are almost a copy of the traps set in Straw Dogs and the whole fight is triggered by a rape (and a murder), also alike.But where Straw Dogs had great acting and a good story,Last House falls down.The acting is very bad and cheap and the story is full of holes and continuity faults. At one point it is midnight but it is still bright outside.There are several strange jumps in time which make it pretty hard to follow.Still,despite all its shortcomings it remains of interest.It is a film that they don't make anymore and it set off the career of Craven who would make his best film 5 years later with the incredibly scary The Hills Have Eyes,a classic in the genre of horror. Best to watch that movie.BTW: Not for the squeamish this film is...",The Last House on the Left
106,iwatcheverything,Cheesy 70's flick or horror classic,6,24 August 2003,I just watched this movie again last night with someone who had never seen this movie before.  The reaction to the film is almost always the same:  It was disturbing.  This was Wes Craven's first real film and if you are a fan of his work then you must see this film.  If you are emotional however then do not watch this movie alone.  This film starts out pretty much like any 70's film and has some bad acting to go with it.  As the film moves on the acting gets better but the film gets more and more violent.  This film shows some frightening acts of human insanity.A fan of horror will have this in their library of films.  It is a true cult classic.,The Last House on the Left

I only watched it because it was mentioned in the Texas chainsaw massacre documentary on the Ultimate edition. This was back when I was a gore hound, so this film disappointed on that level, but it succeeded in giving me an uneasy feeling and feeling frustrated at what was happening. It left a bad taste in my mouth, and was the beginning of my dislike to the trash I now refer to as rape/torture movies. I can't say anything about the characters, mainly I don't remember them very well. Well I did see the remake, and must say it's much more violent in the scenes of torture, mainly a guys head getting micro-waved.

108,Rathko,Unwatchable,1,16 November 2005,"I'm not sure how I managed to get through life without having seen 'Last House on the Left', Wes Craven's first movie and one of the most notorious precursors to the modern horror film. Made on a shoestring budget by Craven and Sean (Friday the 13th) Cunningham, I expected something original, witty, scary, and inventive. Alas, 'House' is nothing more than 85 minutes of mind numbing tedium.The story is a badly realized example of the revenge thriller, a perennial favorite of exploitation cinema, and clearly steals elements from contemporary shockers 'A Clockwork Orange' and 'Straw Dogs', as well as the lurid violence and laughable production values of Hershell Gordon Lewis. The dialogue is laughably bad, the performances are universally amateurish, the direction and editing is incoherent and poorly executed, and the soundtrack is truly terrible. What's more there is not a single shock or scare to be found in the entire movie. The result is a virtually unwatchable example of the worst 50c-a-ticket drive-in trash; something to run silently in the background while teenagers fumbled to unfasten bra straps.The movie fails on every level, and due to the sheer boredom it managed to induce, has the dubious distinction of being the first movie that I have ever had to watch on fast-forward.",The Last House on the Left
109,Tikkin,Shocking...but entertaining?,5,7 May 2006,"Like many others I found Last House On The Left very shocking, but that doesn't translate into entertainment for me. It's good in what it sets out to do, but then it depends on if you find this sort of thing entertaining. I admire how Wes Craven chose to show the acts contained in such a gritty and realistic way, because rape and torture is not glamorous. Last House On The Left really just shows the sort of events we read about in the papers as they would happen. If you like that sort of realism, then this is your thing. As with many of Wes Craven's films, he didn't seem to realise the perfect time to end the film, and so it gets unrealistic when the murderers are themselves murdered by the parents of one of the girls they killed. Despite this I do think it's great as it shows how any human can be possessed to murder another if pushed too far. As I said, great in what it sets out to do, but not 'entertaining' as such.",The Last House on the Left

I would not even categorize this as horror, it's so pathetically poor I was crying, should be in the violent comedy section at Blockbuster. To believe A Clockwork Orange came out a year before and this was all the creativity Wes Craven could come up with.

111,lovecraft231,One of the best 70's Horror Exploitation Movies ever made,10,3 June 2008,"Not even the bad music and comic relief can hurt one of the best Horror/Exploitation movies of the 70's. Before ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""I Spit on Your Grave"", and ""Cannibal Holocaust"" added a documentary like realism to their proceedings, Wes Cravens debut (a loose adaptation of Bergman's ""The Virgin Spring"") did just that. The plot itself is simple: Two girls on their way to a concert are humiliated, tortured, raped, and murdered by a gang of thugs. Later, the thugs take refuge in a house-which just happens to be the home of the girls parents. However, unlike other revenge movies like say, ""Death Wish"", there is no satisfaction to the ensuing vengeance. The viewer is instead left feeling empty and horrified, as the movie essentially deglamorizes on screen violence, showing the general ugliness and pointlessness of violence. Oh, and let's not forget Krug. While Freddy may be more popular, Krug is Craven's scariest villain IMO. He's not a supernatural villain who haunts you in your dreams, he's not a cyborg best pal, he's not a man who controls the dead. He is human evil personified; a villain who feels all too real. That is scarier than Freddy and Jason.",The Last House on the Left
112,RickHarvey,What the hell,1,31 October 2009,"This could possibly be the worst movie ever. I kept hearing it was an dark disturbing film but i found nothing to be disturbing. I know what scenes are meant to have an disturbing effect on the audience, but instead of making me shiver in horror, i wiggled in laughter. The whole thing was awful. If a film is bad, then i accept it . But last house on the left is in a different league entirely.The way they reuse the same shot two or three times. The way they force us to hear the horrid lyrics "" and the road leads to nowhere"" over and over and over again, truth be told, this film leads to nowhere. The dialogue is just plain wrong. At the beginning of the film, an post man ( i think ) talks to his dog about how this girl is the prettiest girl in the whole of ... i forgot. But it cheesy and lazy. Why let a slob tell us this, can't you show it? . The dad also makes an comment on his daughter nipples. Bad, just bad. What made me laugh was the quick reaction shot of the dog at the beginning , What the hell? . Then there the cops. These two couldn't even catch an cold. They speak like dunces, can't find there way around there own town that there meant to protect. How can you call a film disturbing when you have these two dicks walking around like some comedy actors. then there the bandits who , like the rest of the cast , are given horrible, poorly written parts ( the whole thing is poorly written ). Everything is awful. The disembodiment wasn't disturbing, not when the blood is like thick ketchup. Then , before i knew it, the ending scene was here. I got excited when i heard the chainsaw , i thought i may now see some gruesome killing. I'm not a fan of gruesome films but at the time , i just wished the whole cast was cut up. But once again, the film left me in disappointed. After the father kills everyone ( and the mother biting of the precious parts) he sits down in , covered in blood and then... What this. THE TWO COPS. they pop up from nowhere. Bit late now don't you think cops. Like some pant amine act.I don't care if i sound immature because the truth is i spent 18 pounds on this rubbish. It was an shock to read all these positive comments. If you watched this when it first came out, then yeah you would of found it disturbing , but it still an awful film. It not an film that stands over time. With every year that flows past , it seems to get more funnier and funnier. Everything is plain cheesy and to add on to that is this "" to avoid fainting, keep repeating, it only a movie, it only a movie, it only a movie...."" oh please.

113,JeffG.,In a word: vile!,1,3 October 1999,"This movie is terrible on all accounts, on a technical standpoint and in terms of content. There are so many things wrong with this movie, I'm not even sure where to begin.First of all, the story is quite schizophenic. It starts playing out like some sort of comming-of-age movie, then becomes a sort of psychological thriller when they meet the group of Manson Family wanna-be's and wraps up as kind of a revenge movie. Thrown into the mix are these two really stupid cops presumably thrown in for comic relief. Even if these two were funny, which they're weren't, I was left so depressed by this movie that nothing could've lightened the mood. Seeing the way those two girls were brutally tortured and then killed made me want to take a really long shower with lots of soap. And I don't think even that could've washed it all off.This movie was badly done on a technical level as well. The acting was horrible. There wasn't one single good performance from anyone. The cinemetography was really grainy and the film was poorly lit, making each shot in this movie look like someone's last known photograph. It also had the most inappropriate music I've ever heard in a movie (example: peppy banjo music being played over a scene where the killers carry the unconscious, drugged bodies of the two girls and put them in the trunk of their car).The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it eventually had to end. And when it ended, it left me in a really depressed, empty state of mind. I hear Wes Craven has since disowned this movie, and I can hardly blame him. I can only assume he got all of his mistakes out of the way with this film.",The Last House on the Left
114,rwint,Landmark Film Despite it's Flaws,8,18 July 2001,"Landmark horror film about two teen girls killed by some brutes who later receive sterner justice by one of the girls parents.  Dated with bad color, ill advised 'comic relief', and a jarring music score.  It's really just the eight minutes in the woods where the girls are humiliated, tortured, raped, and murdered that make this movie standout. It reaches a certain level of starkness never seen before and in many ways rarely since.  No teasers of cosmic revelations here.  The girls, as in most true life crimes, are killed simply because they 'were in the wrong place at the wrong time'.  The scene also allows for some interesting, multifaceted observations of the characters.  The teens are typically rebelious, yet one reverts to a childhood prayer just before she is killed.  The killers are savage and brutal.  Yet when the crime is over look at the scene with a certain disgust and shame.  The ending scene at the parents house, although done for metaphorical purposes, is redundant, overblown, and not as effective. Sure apple pie, suburban mom would be upset to meet her daughters killers, but would that be enough to do fellatio on a scummy stranger just as a way to kill him?  Overall it's the scenes that work that give this film it's vintage stature. Actor Hess creates a incredibly viscious and intense villiain.

When I was twelve I tried watching it but the beginning bored me and I turned it off, This happened about six times until I turned about 15, then I sat down and saw a masterwork by a master of horror. Wes Craven could have done this died and been a legend, but luckily he has went on to make some classics, The Hills Have Eyes, A Nightmare On Elm Street, The People Under the Stairs, Wes Craven's New Nightmare, Scream and Red Eye are his best. He has also done some utter crap, Swamp Thing, Chiller, Deadly Friend, and Shocker, avoid these. Everything else is pretty mediocre. But Last house is awesome and in his top six for me because it seems so real, as if this horror could happen in your own back yard and that is why this film endures and will keep doing so long after it's remake has crashed and burned in a couple of years. David Hess is the main reason to see this as in this he symbolizes the face of modern horror and makes real even more so than the overly hyped Halloween with Michael Myeres. With David Hess he does not need to hide his face to show evil he has it in his eyes. The first time you see him in this movie you know the girls are in trouble. His gang are equally crazy too but in different ways, Sadie is like a crazed dog off the leash that is just about to slash your throat, Fred is the kind of creep you would see walking at the back of an alleyway waiting to rape you, and Junior is a likable guy who just does not realize what his into.

119,clydestuff,Be sure to replace your speaker before leaving the drive-in,1,29 March 2004,"I'm not sure how certain films gain the status of cult classic over the years.  Sometimes, they are unrecognized little gems that upon initial viewing, went unrewarded by critics and film goers alike.  Often times, they are initial offerings of directors, writers or actors, who eventually went on to bigger and better things.  Sometimes, it has nothing to do with either one of those, and I sit amused and puzzled by the whole thing.  In the case of Last House On The Left, we have what is famed horror director Wes Craven's first solo directorial effort.  The facts are that Wes went on to bigger and better things with Nightmare on Elm Street and Scream, but there is also no doubt about the total ineptitude involved in the making of The Last House On The Left.The story is simple enough.  Two teenage girls Mari(Sandra Cassel) and Phyllis (Lucy Grantham) travel into town on Mari's seventeenth birthday to attend a rock concert.  While walking the streets of the city, they decide to try to buy some pot.  Unfortunately, they try to make their score from a couple of escaped convicts Krug (David Hess), Fred (Fred J. Lincoln), their girlfriend Sadie (Jeramie Rain)and Krug's illegitimate son Junior (Marc Sheffler).  After keeping the girls for an overnight sleepover, they pack them into the trunk of their Cadillac convertible. Then in one of the biggest coincidences no writer worth his salt would dream up, the car breaks down on a road a short ways from Mari's home, where her parents Dr. John(Gaylord St. James) and Estelle (Cynthia Carr)fret and worry about why Mari hasn't returned home yet.  From this point on we are treated to scenes of torture, rape, humiliation, disembowelment, and slow drawn out executions.  And that's just the starter kit, folks.Craven himself has said that this film was made for no other reason than to fill the second bill for drive-in theater owners. It shows in every cheap grainy frame, the horrendous background music, the total ineptitude of the screenplay, the torturous dialog we are subjected to, and some of the wors t plot contrivances ever devised.  As if this weren't enough, they throw in two inept cops (Marshall Anker and Martin Kove)for supposed comedy relief. Drive-in patrons would have been better served if the theater owners had passed out bottles of antacid.I'm sure that Craven's film did the job that it was intended for, and in fact once the film's title was permanently changed to what it is now, the cars piled into the drive in. That's the way drive-in crowds were in those days, the more that word of mouth spread about how depraved a film was, the more one was enticed to see what the commotion was about.  Either that or there was a sudden shortage of motel rooms around the drive-in circuits that year.  For audiences of the 21st century however, looking for a little gore to satisfy their blood thirst, they may wonder what all the fuss was about.I'm sure die hard Craven fans will convince themselves that this is great film making with deep and dark undertones explaining man's inhumanity.  In reality, it's nothing more than a lesson in how much on screen depravity one could get away with in the early seventies to satisfy theater owners wanting to pile in the Chevy's, Ford's, and Oldsmobile's.  In other words, it's the kind of film that should rank in the worst films of all time anywhere.  It beats Gigli and From Justin To Kelly by a country mile, and though not on the IMDB worst list it should be.

Sadly, this is probably one of Craven's worst films, and though I understand it's place in history, I don't understand how it managed to gather any admirers as, vileness aside, it's simply an astonishingly inept film. The cinematography looks like it was shot on a broken lens, the acting is either cheesy as hell or just plain bad, the music is annoying and out of place and worst of all, the two bumbling, comedy relief police officers are grating, annoying and in poor taste.Perhaps intentions were good, in presenting a raw, unglamorous depiction of violence in opposition to the hero-fetishizing of the armed forces (as Craven muses in the DVD documentary), but when the film lacks any real punch and is often just laughably crafted, it has no real effect.

Along with John Carpenter and Sean Cunningham (who produced ""Last House""), Craven ushered in the slasher film in the 80s, and horror has never been the same. Before he started doing slasher movies, however, Craven worked on a number of different movies, including ""Swamp Thing,"" ""The Hills Have Eyes,"" and ""Last House on the Left.""Best likened to Peckinpah's classic ""Straw Dogs,"" ""Last House"" is a no-budget movie literally shot in the backyard of Cunningham's house in Connecticut. It's a fairly typical exploitation/revenge movie, except for the performance of one David Hess.Hess' Krug Stillo is perhaps the most effective portrayal of a slimy, street-smart, patriarchal serial killer and rapist that I have ever seen (okay, so there aren't many characters like that, but who cares?). With wicked smiles and genuinely menacing dialogue, Hess' performance makes Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter look like a pansy. Simply put, you would never want to meet Krug anywhere, let alone a dark alley. This is all the more amazing given that Hess is such an easygoing guy in real life.Craven's camera work and sense of pace is very strong even this early in the game - the shots are realistic without ever being MTV-like or jarring like other low budget movies (*cough* Blair Witch Project *cough*). The story is all about the generation gap and how people can become killers when they are faced with killers.

126,commandercool88,Graphic Intrigue,6,30 March 2007,"I can't think of another film in recent memory that's left me feeling so conflicted. On one hand, Wes Craven's 'Last House on the Left' is an intriguing character study. On the other, it's repulsive. Being Craven's first film, 'Last House' is a very amateurish, documentary-like approach to film. Yet through all its flaws, this sadistic film just makes the grade.On their way to a concert, friends Mair and Phyllis are encountered and kidnapped by a small group that includes several local escaped convicts. Powerless against the gang of psychopaths, the two teenagers are raped and brutally murdered. Unknowingly, the killers seek refuge in the house of one of the victims. When the reality of their situation sets in and they uncover the gruesome truth, the parents will enact a plan of revenge so haunting, so brutal.'Last House' lacks the substance that makes some of Craven's later films so memorable, but there remains a certain edge to this movie that makes it so interesting. It's like nothing that's ever been made before, at least that I've seen, and there's a level of intrigue that makes it impossible to look away. Its 1972 release ruffled more than a few feathers, and while it may seem tame by today's standards, its frank approach to rape and torture is still disturbing even today. It's distasteful in every sense of the word, throwing morals and values right out the window. But there's a fascination to it all, watching it all unfold in graphic detail. I can only imagine what could have been done with this film had its script been written in more than three days, and with a bigger budget. But its gritty and raw style is appropriate enough, and gives the film a startling realistic atmosphere.There's nothing particularly stand-out about the film's cast, they're all rather tepid. But it passes. Clearly, David Hess is the best thing about this film, playing the ringleader of the gang. He's ruthless and unnerving, along with Fred Lincoln, Hess's sidekick known as 'Weasel' (he actually does look like a weasel). And for all that they're put through, Sandra Cassel and Lucy Grantham deliver haunting performances as the two teens who are humiliated and reduced to something less than human. Jeramie Rain's animal-like features put her to good use, and Marc Sheffler, who plays Hess's son, is worth watching if only for his character's climactic scene at the end.In the end, 'Last House on the Left' can be seen as a launching pad to a career with much more promise and potential. Wes Craven's debut film isn't bad, it just isn't very good either. Take it for what it is, a film whose main purpose is to push the envelope as much as it possibly can. And for its day and age, it succeeded in doing just that. My suggestion? For casual horror fans, stick to Craven's later, and much better, work. 'Last House' is better suited to those interested in exploring the beginnings of a horror master.",The Last House on the Left
127,Boggman,Doesn't hold up that well,5,17 June 2005,"Wes Craven's written & directorial debut is amateurish at best. You can definitely see the potential in Craven by watching this early work, however; the movie as a whole is marred by time. While this film may have been quite the shocker back in it's day, a second viewing at this point in time doesn't really deliver the chills and thrills that it did back when it was released.Two young girls go to a concert, and in returning home decide to try and score themselves a little weed. They approach a man who leads them to an apartment upstairs. Once inside, they quickly realize they have made a big mistake. 3 escaped convicts (2 men and 1 woman) are waiting for them with sadistic glee. The girls are forced in the trunk and driven out to the woods, where they are forced to pee their pants, strip, & make-out with each other. Then they are raped all while the convicts laugh gleefully and perversely. An attempt to escape the confines of there attackers proves fatal.Our villains need a place to shack up, and it just so happens that the last house on the left belongs to the one of the girls parents, who have been anxiously awaiting their daughters safe return. After feeding and housing the killers, the parents soon discover that these 4 people have done away with there daughter.So what do they do..they booby trap the house, and momma performs fellatio on one of the attackers while his hands are tied behind his back before biting of his yin-yang.The whole thing is kind of silly, far fetched, and unbelievable. If you like watching the beginning efforts of today's most successful directors, then ""Last House on the Left"" is worth a viewing.Just don't expect to be blown away (no pun intended LOL) by it.By today's standards, it' succeeds as more of a history lesson of early horror than anything else.",The Last House on the Left
128,Snake-666,"Disturbing, sickening but not too bad",6,29 April 2002,"This film, like the similarly themed 'I Spit On Your Grave', is harrowing, sickening and disgusting.This was Wes Craven's directing debut and what a shocker (no pun intended) it turned out to be.The story revolves around a group of psychotic killers and two teenage girls out for the night. The girls try to score some dope but unfortunately end up kidnapped, raped and eventually murdered by these killers. One of the murder scenes is particularly harrowing but I won't describe it in case people haven't seen the film.Naturally the killers get their just desserts, but unlike 'I Spit On Your Grave', it is the parents of one of the girls that do it. Like 'I Spit On Your Grave', male genitalia is once again harmed in a sickening way, and all you guys better get ready to cringe.Unfortunately this film is damaged by an attempted comedy element featuring two bumbling police officers and a stupid piece of background music, which is repeated over and over again to the point where you are willing to give up on the film. Personally, I don't think trying to add comedy to such a film is a good idea and in my opinion this is one of the film's main flaws.As most of this pitiful comedy takes place during the first part of the film people are tempted just to turn it off, as I was. But I decided to give the film a chance and in the end it is a very well thought out film. I wouldn't say the film was overly entertaining but it was certainly sickening and dark (except those stupid police officers) and is a satisfying horror film, while also making statements about drug abuse, gang control, rape and murder.",The Last House on the Left
129,RomanJamesHoffman,"Flawed, and slightly dated, torture-porn which nevertheless still packs a decent punch",6,19 August 2013,"Directed by horror maestro Wes Craven ('Nightmare on Elm St' and 'Scream') and produced by Sean Cunningham ('Friday the 13th'), 'Last House on the Left' is one of those titles which has left an indelible mark on the cinematic landscape in daring to have taken its viewers on an excursion into the outer reaches of what is permissible.The story is an updating of Ingmar Bergman's revenge tragedy 'The Virgin Spring' (1960) but where Bergman's movie is set in Medieval Sweden, Craven sets 'Last House' in the present (a move which shows how archetypal such a story and such emotions are) and centers around two teenage girls: Mari (Cassel) and Phyllis (Grantham) who are planning to go to a rock concert in New York City. Along the way they happen upon Junior, a reluctant member of a deviant quartet also composed of Fred ""Weasel"" Podowski, Sadie, and the head-honcho Krug (Hess). Junior takes the girls to the group where they then have to undergo a horrendous series of violent and sexual acts before being brutally murderedall for kicks. Then, through a fateful coincidence the quartet end up taking refuge at the house of one of the murdered girls and, when the parents come to realise what has happened to their daughter and who is responsible, savage redemption is enacted.Brutal stuff...and still unpleasant viewing today, even in a climate where torture porn has become a (somewhat) mainstream genre. This is no doubt due to the atmosphere of brutal realism which the film effectively creates through a pseudo-documentary style cinematography (presumably due to the low budget). Still, while the movie irrefutably deserves the evocative epithets like ""disgusting"", ""disturbing"", ""visceral"" and so on which it acquired upon its release, and its later inevitable placing on the list of Video Nasties drawn up by the Director of Public Prosecutions in the UK in the early 80s, a modern viewer may well find the overall impact of the movie less than what they expect from the hysteria which surrounds it. This may well come from some patchy acting, some patchy editing, and the inclusion of slapstick interludes (presumably the metaphorical spoonful of sugar to help the medicine go down) which seem incongruous and taint the atmosphere of menace which other films which followed in the wake of 'Last House' ('I Spit on your Grave', 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' 'Cannibal Holocaust' etc.) would present unrelentingly.Still, messy it may be, but 'Last House' is still important and worth watching, not because it opened the door for the shock and gore fests of the Seventies and Eighties which in ramping everything upto 11 only succeeded in titillating the audience at bestboring them at worst, but in beginning (albeit slightly inarticulately) to provide a social commentary on violence through a direct cinematic presentation of it.",The Last House on the Left
130,Katz5,And the Road Leads to Nowhere....,8,15 August 2020,"Much has already been written about Last House on the Left by other IMDb users. But I will add that it is easily Wes Craven's best film - even compared to the original Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream, Hills Have Eyes, The People Under the Stairs, etc. This film is raw and in-your-face. There are two ways to approach it: As a shocking exploitation and revenge thriller (which it of course is). Or a black comedy (which it surprisingly also is). One thing it is not is a supernatural horror film, which some DVD boxes and the ad campaign may lead one to believe. The Last House on the Left doesn't sit on the gates of hell.....it's simply the house the heroes of the movie live in. Why black comedy? The foursome of villains - as despicable as they and their actions are. Krug, the leader (played by David Hess, who also wrote the folky songs for the film), is busted from serving a life sentence after killing, get this, a priest and not one but two nuns. And when we first meet him, he pops a child's balloon with his cigar. He hooks his son on heroin to control him. His son would prefer to be a bullfrog, living on his own lily pad. Weasel, played by future porn director Fred Lincoln, is a comic sidekick, alternately complaining and cracking sarcastic jokes. Sadie, the woman in the foursome, is not your typical gun crazy ditz but a dreamer. All of them, except ""Junior,"" reveal pure evil and rabid animal-like behavior during the film's second half (Sadie is even described as being ""animal-like"" by the newscaster describing their crime spree).Upon this foursome from hell come two hippie chicks, one from a loving liberal family outside New York City. And as mentioned many times by other critics and IMDb users, it does not go well for the chicks, and ultimately the bad guys (and gal).It's a revenge story that only the ""feeling their oats"" era of the new Hollywood of the late '60s and early '70s could produce. Yes, the film gets sidetracked with the silly business with the policemen and the woman with the chickens. But Craven probably inserted that for slapstick comic relief. The film, then and now, is just too heavy an experience for many viewers.The remake is slicker and does some interesting things with the villains and the girl's family (not to mention change the girl's fate compared to the first film). It's a decent remake but has none of the raw, almost home movie feel, of the original.The DVD contains lots of bonus material including interviews with Craven and the actors who play the main villains - all of them seem to be in disbelief, when the interviews were filmed in the early '00s, that they appeared in such a film. Hess, who passed away several years ago, seemed like a genuinely nice guy from the interviews, and Lincoln claims he finds the film absolutely repellent and can't watch it.The film should be seen by film buffs probably more so than horror buffs, who may prefer Craven's more traditional icky horror film Hills Have Eyes.",The Last House on the Left
131,Vince-5,"""And the road leads to nowhere...""",10,6 June 2001,"Whether you love it or hate it (there really seems to be no in-between), you must admit that Last House on the Left is a powerful film. In my opinion, it may be one of the most important American films ever made. Screw Scream--this is Wes Craven's best. Combining professional and amateurish elements on a low budget, it has the scratchy, over-saturated look of a perverse home movie--and the rough edges make it all the more unforgettable. The actors are very good, especially David A. Hess in his definitive role as sadistic sex murderer Krug and Jeramie Rain as a deranged woman obviously modeled after Sadie Glutz. The brutal rape-murders and scenes of vengeance are staged in a chilling, claustrophobic manner that makes you feel like you're there. Oddly enough, the clash of light (the comically inept cops, the cheery soundtrack) and dark elements creates a juxtaposition that's even more disturbing; despite what's happening, the three nuts are enjoying themselves without remorse and the rest of the world just bounces along obliviously. Also, the cop scenes often provide a necessary break from the brutality, giving you a brief second to breathe before plunging you back in. A tone of grim tension is maintained throughout, and it clings to you long after you've left the Last House. How, you ask, could a person enjoy something like this? Because it does what a horror movie is ultimately supposed to do, and I know that in the end, ""It's only a movie...only a movie...only a movie...""",The Last House on the Left
132,Kashmirgrey,Putrid Filth,1,4 October 2007,"There is absolutely nothing of value and nothing at all positive about Wes Craven's ""The Last House on the Left"". When I refer to positive, I am talking quality of film making. This film is the accumulation of feces and urine that you find in a neglected highway rest stop public toilet. A person who finds this film entertaining, even as a horror film, drinks from that toilet and considers the water sweet. One definition of art is ""the human effort to imitate... the work of nature."" So I suppose it can be said with some technical accuracy, as disappointing as it is, that this film's attempt to realistically mimic abominable sadism is art, just as an oil painting of that highway rest stop toilet is art.Marri (Sandra Cassel) is a 17 year girl who sets out with her friend Lucy (Phyllis Stone) for a rock concert. They decide to attempt to find a little ""grass"" before the concert and are tricked into accompanying a young man (Marc Sheffler) who promises good ""Columbian"", but instead leads them to the hideout of three fugitives. The girls are abducted at knife point and taken out into the woods where they graphically humiliated, tortured, and murdered. As a poor attempt by Craven at irony, these acts occur near Mari's home where her parents are frantic about their missing daughter. At first, Mari's parents offer hospitality to the four criminals when they come to their home seeking help, but when Mari's mother and father learn their daughter has been murdered and the four are responsible, they exact their revenge.Just like most people, I watched this film because of the hyped up controversially realistic sexual violence. However, I was also a 17 year old teen boy who did not yet have children of his own, understand the sociological negative effect of such films, and the wisdom to steer way clear. What the eyes see and the ears hear the brain can never erase.But let's talk horror since this film is referred to by many as a ""ground-breaking"" film of that genre. Several of my reviews indicate my belief that ""snuff"" (actual murder filmed for profit) exists and someday will become the next mainstream horror. Why? Because a great many people enjoy watching realistic depictions of torture and murder; the more realistic, the better. That is what today's horror film has devolved to. It is not about intense suspense, disturbing ambiguity, and bizarre oddities anymore. It is just about how ""in your face"" and realistic the violence is, especially if it is sexual violence. Craven attempts even more irony by running pleasant-sounding music simultaneously with the torture and murder scenes of the two girls. The resulting effect: utterly ridiculous absurdity. The music absolutely sucks, to boot. The acting is pathetic as well. Mari's script reads like a fourth grader's attempt at Shakespeare. The criminals come across as so idiotic that there is no way they could actually drive a car let alone successfully escape from jail, and the rest of the cast assist in transforming this film into an unintended botched and unfunny comedy.Undoubtedly, if you're reading reviews of this film and have not seen it, you probably will. I strongly encourage you not to, though. The only reason people do is for the sexual violence, and not only is that fairly brief, the greater question you should ask yourself is: why?",The Last House on the Left

136,movieman89-2,I can understand why people didn't like it at the time,6,7 September 2012,"Before I saw this, a few years ago, I watched the remake. It was pretty good but the main rape scene really put me off, I really didn't like it because it was too much in your face with no subtle effect and they made it last forever. Horror is my passion, I absolutely love it. I can deal with gore and violence but not rape. Time went by and I watched the original The Hills Have Eyes and I loved it. I then thought I wander what this is like. I did hear from friends that its not that bad for today's standards, so I plucked up the courage and watched it. I have to say I did enjoy it.The characters were connective and believable. I wish that I had a chance to get to know Mari a little bit more so I can feel more for her. The villains were really effective and you do feel a sense of unease when you see them. A part I really liked about this film is when after the things the villains have done to the girls, there are shots of the villains just keeping quite with facial expressions that say 'What have we just done?!'This gives the sense that they have a bit of remorse, which you don't see in movies anymore. I really liked the way it give us the audience a bit of surprised feeling, thinking they are human after all.The acting is good enough. It is slightly dated but that doesn't bother me. I also really like the picture quality of the film which, I think gives a raw effect. The atmosphere of the film is great, its bleak and suspenseful.Now the scenes of what the villains do to the girls, yes they are horrible and made me uncomfortable watching them. But what they do is that you see them begin to do something and then it focuses on a character watching it happen in shock or discussed or it even cuts to another scene in general. I love the way thats done because it leaves it to your imagination and you knowing whats going to happen. Well done Wes. We don't need to see it in full detail. The main rape scene was still disturbing and the worst bit in the film, but they didn't drag it on for too long. I can understand why it was banned and why people were shocked by it.The scenes where the villains are staying at the parents house and find out what happened to their daughter were the best parts of the movie. It kept me on the edge of my seat thinking 'this going to get nasty'. The other great thing is that it didn't focus too much on gore. Which horror films are overloaded with these days. Again it doesn't bother me, but for me, it needs to be used for appropriately.The only thing I really didn't like about the film is the choice of soundtrack. At the end it did get rather annoying. For example, a chase scene, they use banjo happy chirpy music. How does that fit may I ask? The filming and cinematography really worked and that's one of the reasons how this is effective. Overall, it was very good, except the soundtrack. When watching it try not to get too bothered and try to focus on what's going on. I also warn you that this is not for the faint hearted. If you think you're going to get offended by watching this, please don't. Wes Craven fans (which I have become a bigger fan of, loved Nightmare On Elm Street, Serpent And The Rainbow, Scream etc.) I recommend you this so you can see what style of filming he uses and where he began his career.",The Last House on the Left
137,DJRMewzique,"Forty years later, hardly shocking, just badly done.",1,12 May 2012,"Still considered one of the most grotesque horror films of all time, Wes Craven's ""The Last House on the Left"" remains a cult favourite and has gotten numerous critical raves, and for the life of me, I cannot figure out why.A simple story of revenge, that claims to be based on a true story (the only real true story is that the film is based on an Ingmar Bergmann film called Virgin Spring"" from 1960), the film with a title that has nothing to do with the plot at all starts with two girls heading to the big city for a concert. On the way, they hope to score some weed and in doing so, get captured by a family of jail escapees who proceed to torture, rape and kill them before happening upon one of the girl's parents, in a coincidental twist that verges on the idiotic. When the parents realize what has happened, you can guess what they do It is clear that this film was made to simply shock and appal, made by two guys with no experience and no money. Well, no money at the time, anywayCraven went on to direct ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""Scream"" while producer Sean S. Cunningham is responsible for the entire ""Friday the 13th"" series. But forty years later, the film does not hold up at all. The violence is almost laughable because the acting is just so horrid, you see very little, the soundtrack, purposely contrasting with the images of violence, is ridiculous and the bits of comic relief are dreadful. What you end up with is a really badly made b-movie horror film that is nothing short of ridiculous on every level.When watching the extras, Wes Craven discusses how the film was made with a bunch of inexperienced people, the one person having any cinematic knowledge being one of the actors...because he had done numerous porn films. Brilliant.It is clear the filmmakers had no experiencenor did they have any idea how to make a film. Maybe this film was shocking was back in 1972, when it was made for $80000 and raked in 3.5 million, but by today's standards, I would expect more from a student film.I have no issue with the sadistic violence.

What disappointed me the most is a scene where the girls were made to kiss after stripping their clothes off, actually happened off camera. I guess this is because in 1976, two girls kissing on the big screen was considered a bigger taboo than two girls getting raped and murdered.

I guess that I have been desensitized to brutality after years of watching films like Salo and I Spit on Your Grave. This film just seems like a warm up to those. But it still got me thinking about how movies nowadays tend to avoid this kind of stark, realistic, brutal violence. Too often we expect the damsel in distress to be rescued by a lantern jawed hero who spouts some cheesy one liner before giving the villain a sound thrashing. Not in this film. There is no escape for our damsels in distress. There is no hero waiting in the wings ready to rescue them right before they get the chop. There is no hope for them, no good luck around the corner. They will be used and abused however their captors see fit until they tire of it, and then... GOODNIGHT! This serves a purpose, in that when the gang finally get their comeuppance you feel that they get whatever they deserve, even though the way they are dispatched is just as sadistic and violent as the acts they committed. I guess studios now want to include at least an element of hope in their films, but why?

143,Krug Stillo,A genuine classic to be studied,10,31 May 2003,"SPOILERS!!! Predating the flood of American horror films released in the wake of the Vietnam war, Wes Craven's phenomenal 1972 classic, The Last House on the Left is the amateur film that took horror to another, more terrifying level.Influencing the sadism of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (Tobe Hooper, 1974),the inventiveness of The Evil Dead (Sam Raimi, 1982) and the documentary filming style of The Blaire Witch Project (Eduardo Sanchez & Daniel Myrick, 1999), Craven's film is a powerful and raw experience, once seen, never forgotten.`All that blood and violence, I thought you were supposed to be the love generation!'Last House. was Wes Craven's film debut. It tells the story of Phyllis and Mary (played by Sandra Peabody and Lucy Grantham); two girls who, on their way to a rock concert, try to 'score some grass.' When they ask a young man named Junior whether he's dealing cannabis, he invites them back to his apartment where they meet the three other occupants. Krug (played by the brilliant method actor David Alexander Hess), Sadie, the group's sex toy, and Weasel, the sleaziest of imaginable perverts it comes as no surprise that this bloke is a famous pornstar. The moment the girls enter the apartment Junior locks the door, trapping them inside. Krug suddenly appears before the girls from a hidden position, gleefully saying - 'Gotcha!' Suddenly the film has leapt into a nightmare situation which is the beginning of offensive for those who cannot take it. A word of advice, if you don't like this film now, don't bother! In an attempt to 'cross the northern border', the group venture with Phyllis and Mary in the trunk of their car. When the vehicle breaks down in the dense forestry Krug and his gang members decide to 'have a little fun', taking the weeping young girl's into the woods where they humiliate, torture, rape and eventually kill both. What follows is the most frightening scene in the history of horror. It is not the hideous atrocities committed by the group that is so terrifying, but, once the girls are dead, the group blankly stare at each other frowning, evidently repelled by their own actions. The degenerates did not plan any of these incidents; they simply got carried away. These characters are far more frightening than any monster, ghost or psycho ever committed to celluloid because they are eemphasised as real human beings. Film director George Romero already brought horror closer to home with his 1969 horror epic film, Night of the Living Dead, by replacing castles, old dark houses and distant lands with familiar everyday settings. Last House on the Left not only followed the example set by Romero, but also released onto the world third dimensional monsters, characters who could possibly be in your own garden.Aware that 'the cops is closing,' the gang ironically seeks refuge in the home of Mr. and Miss Collingwood, unaware that they are Mary's parents. There is a moment of obvious class division during the scene where the group eats spaghetti in the Collingwood's home. Krug eats open mouthed, Sadie gulps down large glasses of wine and Weasel belches loudly before stating - 'This food is impeccable.'There is an evident, albeit incongruous streak of comedy throughout the film. There are two deputies who run 'out of gas' driving to the Collingwoods' home and subsequently have to hitch a ride from a chicken truck driver. The fugitive group, when not eviscerating, mutilating and dismembering young girls are also comical. In one scene, Krug pushes Junior to the floor for dreaming about, and impersonating a frog. Another unusual aspect of the film is its soundtrack, written and composed by actor David Alexander Hess. Consisting of banjos and tambourines the 'badies theme' can be heard most of the time there isn't anything particularly gruesome happening on screen. Miss Collingwood notices that Junior is wearing Mary's necklace, then later that evening overhears the group argument -Junior: Krug, we gotta get out of here. If they found out we killed their kid... Krug: Shut up! Or you'll wind up in the lake with her.The remaining scenes of the film consist of the parents extracting revenge for their daughter's death. Miss Collingwood seduces weasel before castrating him. Krug is shot by Mr. Collingwood and then beheaded with a chain saw. Sadie in an attempt to escape runs from the house, but has her throat cut by Miss Collingwood, while Junior shoots himself with his father's gun. The deputies finally arrive to find the blood soaked couple breathless and recovering from their outburst of madness, resembling the group who were also shocked by their own sadistic actions earlier in the film.Although The Last House on the Left is undeniably relentless in its effort to disturb and horrify, it does have redeeming qualities. Under the low circumstances in which it was made, Last House on the Left was filmed mostly with hand held cameras, bringing a sense of realism to the film. The acting is somewhat amateurish, but as a debut for, both director Wes Craven and producer Sean Cunningham, this film not only grossed millions of dollars, but also has developed cult status and is constantly referred to as Wes Craven's greatest achievement.It is suggested that the Manson family massacre was influential for the making of this film. At the time of Last House on the Left's emergence, the hippie era was coming to an end, memories of the Kennedy assassination were still resonant and America could see stomach churning footage of the Vietnam broadcast on the news. The film can be seen as a representation of a nihilistic period and an evaluation of the 'decay of American culture'.The story of The Last House on the Left was loosely based on Swedish Film-maker Ingmar Bergman's earlier epic The Virgin Spring where a three shepherds similarly rape and murder a young girl before receiving their comeuppance from the girl's vengeful parents. Following the release of The Last House on the Left, a new wave in horror emerged. Hundreds of similarly themed films were produced with similar situations involving turning the tables in the name of revenge, the majority of them blatant rip-offs: House on the Edge of the Park (Ruggero Deodato, 1980); Late Night Train Murders (Aldo Lado, 1974); all very reminiscent of Craven's film.Viscerally more intense than any other horror/suspense film, The Last House on the Left will continue to provoke controversy and obtain the hearts of true devotees to a dying genre for years to come.Ironically, a last house on the left doesn't even appear in the film.",The Last House on the Left
144,axapvov,Disgusting Snuff with Shameless Advertising,1,20 January 2018,"The Last House on the Left has nothing, absolutely nothing to do with films like The Virgin Spring, Wait Until Dark or Straw Dogs.

Then the film industry started an advertising campaign in the lines of ""Do you dare to watch it?"" challenging sick audiences to misinterpret repugnance as an emotion conveyed by film craft. I´m asking, what if I film myself taking a crap and then put some soft country music over it, would that be art? No, it would be just a videoclip of someone taking a crap, nothing more. Can you imagine someone going like ""what a brave film-maker, the first one to show bare crap with such raw emotion""?The Last House on the Left goes further, it also displays preposterous scenes with an up-beat soundtrack. Is this supposed to be a comedy? The police men must be the worst comic relief of all time, then. Then there is the convenient location of the house. The killers spend the night in the city and then move exactly there. The script is vomit, plain and simple. Even those who glorify it recognize it as amateurish, silly and worthless. Exploitation is like porn, it doesn´t make sense to pretend it has a higher purpose. However I´d rather watch Super Vixens or Foxy Brown a thousand times, at least they´re funny and stylish. This isn´t exploitation, though, it´s torture porn. The mere expression is disgusting and makes me worry about what kind of sick person would enjoy it. I´d recommend snuff movies, how is that for raw film-making?I don´t care about its historic importance. Is it the first film to do this or that? That doesn´t mean anything. Is Roundhay Garden Scene the best movie ever? Of course not.",The Last House on the Left
145,Aditya_Gokhale,A wasted opportunity...a terrible film!,3,29 October 2007,"I absolutely hate the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movies and have considered Wes Craven to be the most overrated directors of all time.But I read in several places that his directorial debut, ""The Last House on the Left"" was supposed to be his best effort and far better than his later movies.After reading the movie synopsis, it seemed promising enough and so I decided to watch this movie. But I was in for a disappointment, to find a great premise for a film (which is a rip-off of Ingmar Bergman's 'The Virgin Spring'), wasted completely.There are several reasons why the film is utterly tasteless..To name a few of its bad qualities...there's some terrible, terrible acting..with the exception of perhaps David Hess who aptly plays a sick, demented rapist. There is a completely out-of-place soundtrack and background score, which is far from the mood that any particular scene is supposed to create!! I mean, if it's gotta be a shock thriller, then there has to be a creepy soundtrack to complement it. But what you get is a cheerful 70s style score instead, playing in the background as the brutal events in this ""movie"" unfold! The much touted ""graphic"" violence is mostly off-screen and not much is actually shown..what we get is more of the crappy soundtrack (electronic PC speaker-like sound for stabbing?!?! Gimme a break!) and the moments AFTER the brutality has actually happened. And did I mention the completely unnatural sequences and mannerisms from the characters?? The reaction and the subsequent actions of the parents of the brutally raped/murdered girl are so unnatural, I don't know whether to blame it on the bad acting or the bad direction.Oh..and the icing on this stale and tacky cake is the totally unnecessary comical acts of the two bungling cops! (good grief!) Did we really need that in a shock thriller/horror whatever-you-may-wanna-call-it movie? And why use them as fillers in this already concise movie with a running length of not more than 85 minutes? These really ridiculous comic scenes have some more of that stupid music playing in the background!All in all, there is absolutely nothing in this movie that can give it the tag of being dark or shocking! This is a wasted opportunity..a premise that would've made a great picture, had it been handled by a more talented director.",The Last House on the Left
146,LagerLagerLagerShouting,A Disturbing And Influential Cult Classic.,8,12 September 2002,"LHOTL is based loosely on Ingmar Bergman's The Virgin Spring and to this day, although dated, still remains a very accomplished, disturbing and influential piece of film making. Craven's debut is undoubtedly a product of a 1970's middle-America weaned on violence in the Vietnam War era. Here he cleverly goes no-holds-barred to shock a society where violent individuals are still rife. He employs this through the introduction of one of his pet themes, the deconstruction of the nuclear family and here the conflict arises through two opposing families going head-to-head. The decent family, a symbol of white-Christian American society, turns to their primitive side to overcome the make-shift psychotic familiar (an early 70's horror theme also explored two years later in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre). Shot on grainy 16mm it is a dark, disturbing affair with scenes of violence, torture and rape that could be considered taboo! (That is in the uncut version, still banned in Britain since 1984 not the recent butchered version). But it is decently handled, capturing the fear, paranoia and important themes of the time. David Hess is so chilling as lead psycho Krug that he would inevitably become type cast in later films like Hitch-Hike and House on the Edge of the Park, but as for his music score, lets just say it doesn't fit in!8/10",The Last House on the Left
147,grybop,"You can't fool me, Wes!",3,24 April 2002,"""At last!"", I said to myself today when I finally found Last house on the left at my local video store.  I was prepared to watch one of the most horrifying movies ever made! And that's because I had read all the comments here. Well, I must say, the film didnt live up to my expectations almost at all; and I don't think it was due to watching the shortened version instead of the full one. The plot is fairly simple and could be intriguing had the stupid subplot with the sheriff been omitted. Then there's the music : it would be more suitable for a comedy! It didn't let me take anything I was watching seriously! The acting lacked credibility and there were holes in the plot (why on earth would anyone put up a bunch of strangers ???). I've made up my mind: Craven cannot scare me!3",The Last House on the Left
148,tamstrat,Haunting movie,6,1 June 2005,"I first saw Last House on the Left at the age of 18 at the drive in with my best girlfriend. This movie, an early outing by horror maven Wes Craven was so disturbing to me that 26 years later I am still haunted by the images on the screen. The story, of 2 young girls, approximately the same age I was when I saw the film, of being abducted, tortured, raped and then murdered is not for the faint of heart. The brutality and violence was staggering, and the film spoke volumes of the depravity of the human soul. I remember driving home with my girlfriend after watching this, and both of us were dead silent, each contemplating what we had watched and knowing that something like that could happen to us. This movie is one I know without a doubt, that I will never again watch, and now, being the parent of a daughter myself, I could never watch it and then allow her out of the house again. This is not a monster movie, the MONSTERS are human and all too real, especially in today's society filled with Ted Bundy's and The Green River Killer, this movie hits too close to home and leaves the viewer depressed and saddened at what human beings are capable of doing to other innocent people. Watch it if you dare, but be prepared to be left with a very hollow feeling after it is over.",The Last House on the Left
149,Milo-Jeeder,"It's supposed to be a horror film, but it tries to be a drama and a comedy at the same time... and it fails",5,26 February 2008,"While a lot of people seem to praise this film as a horror gem, I myself consider it more like a drama a mildly gruesome drama, but certainly not horror. I can enjoy horror films that don't contain some of the expected traits, like: jumps, creepy music, lots of screaming or tons of gore but there has to be something to remind us that this is, in fact, a horror movie after all. To be honest though, there is a little bit of gore, that's true but if the atmosphere isn't reminiscent of a horror film, the gore itself ends up being out of place. I was expecting something good, as I consider Wes Craven to be a very talented horror director, but I guess he simply wasn't in his prime back then. On 'Last House on the Left', the story revolves around a group of criminals, three guys and a trashy girl, who have recently escaped from prison. Two girls on her way to a concert, decide to stop by a house, looking for marijuana. The girls are kidnapped by these ex convicts, who torture them, rape them and eventually murder them in a brutal way. After butchering the two friends, the gang seeks refuge with the parents of one of the victims, who are completely unaware of everything. However, when the man of the house finds out about what happened to his daughter and who were responsible for what happened to her, he teams up with his wife to execute a gruesome revenge against his four guests.The idea of two vindictive parents trying to avenge their dead daughter sounded promising and original for a horror film. It gives hopes for something tragic, dramatic and gruesome, but in the end, ""Last House on the Left"" ends up being more like a drama full of missed opportunities. One would expect a movie like this to reach its high point in the scene where the parents are finally able to avenge their daughter, but to my disappointment, this confrontation takes place only during the very last minutes of the film and it is shown in a very bland way. I can understand that minimalism works in certain films, and I don't expect all movies to offer some kind of gruesome shock value. The problem is that simplicity is not exactly something that one would expect from a film like this, where a certain amount of gruesomeness is almost mandatory. When the father finds out about what happened to his daughter, he looks completely numb. We never really get to see any signs of devastation, which would have added a well-placed share of drama to the story and would have made the last minutes much more powerful and tragic. My main problem with this film, however, is the fact that there are a few moments of pointless slapstick comedy. I mean, how can this be explained. It's supposed to be a horror film, but instead it is a horrible drama with a few comedy moments? We see a girl getting stabbed and right after that, we see two dumb cops doing funny things for the audience to laugh. Honestly, I don't get it. I also find the banjo music to be inappropriate, as it works as a some kind comedy relief and it really doesn't make any sense in a movie like this. I am aware that sometimes, joyful music in horror movies is a way to create some kind of strong contrasting atmosphere, but in 'Last House on the Left', it simply sounded out of place. Most people seem to be impressed about the 'appalling gore' and impressive scenes, but I was mostly surprised by the lack of them. True, there are a few scenes that looked pretty brutal, but the gore is not striking enough to save the entire movie. I don't really understand what's the deal with the lame tag line that says 'To avoid fainting, keep repeating ""It's only a movie...It's only a movie...""'. I didn't find any parts to be that horrifying, to be honest. Even though I don't focus on the gore very much, I must admit that there are certain horror movies that make up for the weak plot, with a nice amount of carnage... unfortunately, this film is not one of those.I give this movie 5 stars because even though I don't agree with the overhype, I still think it's a watchable drama with a few horror and comedy elements scattered around.",The Last House on the Left

151,PaulyC,"To avoid fainting, remember, it's only a movie...",7,17 June 2008,"This movie starts out fairly poorly with a few silly scenes and some cheese-ball acting. Then comes the scene where the two young girls, who seem to be the leads of the film, get kidnapped by a gang of thugs lead by their leader, Krug. Suddenly there's a little tension in the film. Then, of course, we get to the scene in the woods. This scene takes the movie from semi-cheesy horror film to something unique. The pure violent rawness of the scene is effective. I won't say what happens besides that one of the girls is forced to urinate in her own pants and eventually the two girls are made to kiss each other. Not such cheerful stuff but you can feel the tension of the two frightened girls effectively. The best performance in the film comes from David Hess as Krug. There is strong acting throughout but not by everybody. It's hard to say much more about the story without giving stuff away. When this movie was first released it had two different titles, one being ""Krug and company"", and the other ""Sex Crime of the Century"" which producer, Sean Cunningham (of Friday the 13th fame) came up with and thought would make the movie a hit. Anyway, the movie flopped big time. Then someone came up with the title, ""Last house on the left"", which had nothing to do with the plot, and a slogan which declared ""To avoid fainting, keep telling yourself, it's only a movie, it's only a movie..."". These two adjustments attracted tons of customers and suddenly the movie was a hit. Funny what a little clever slogan can do. Good Stuff!",The Last House on the Left

155,latherzap,Intensity,8,12 March 2005,"I first saw this movie years ago when I was 15. I didn't scare easy but LHOTL really had me on edge. And I don't think any other movie ever made me jump up in the air, as this one did in one jolting scene.As you probably know, two teenage girls are kidnapped and tortured in the woods by a group of ex-cons. The parents of one of the girls soon take their revenge. Most of the acting seems very natural. And the inexperienced camera-work gives much of the film a cheap documentary appearance, making the events all the more real. There is some odd comic relief with two bumbling cops. Fans, myself included, often find this annoying. But I must say that when I saw it as a kid the cop scenes were a welcome break, allowing me to relax a bit.David Hess as Krug is amazing. Weasel is sleaze on two legs, and who can forget Sadie? Especially bizarre for some viewers is that the killers actually have some affection for each other. They're not simple fairy tale monsters.The scene of Mari walking into the lake is heartbreaking. They destroyed her will to live. And notice the killers are not jumping up and down in victory. They are not all that ashamed, but neither are they proud. They are empty. Some serial killers have commented that the actual murders generally did not provide the ""high"" they were hoping for. I actually enjoy most of the music in the movie, and especially find the opening track haunting. And there actually is some comedy to be found in parts. Notice Krug popping the little boy's balloon near the beginning. Evil personified!",The Last House on the Left

Well, the original was campy, a little corny, acting was amateur and maybe just silly at times. But it was horrifying, not as horrifying compared to the remake.

157,nutsy,Exploitive Non-Horror,1,9 April 2004,"Wes Craven's THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT was one of the first in a very long tradition of exploitive films that were labeled as horror but weren't. This film is not particularly exploitive (at least when compared to later examples of the genre), but it isn't scary either. I'm not a huge fan of horror, but this fails as a film for any genre (or none).-POSSIBLE SPOILERS-This really doesn't even pretend to be a horror film. It's a very dated tragedy/drama about two girls who are kidnapped, abused, and murdered by a group of criminals who are eventually murdered by the parents of the victims.-END SPOILERS-Throughout the film, there are no shocks, no creepy music or photography, nothing even resembling horror. What the viewer gets instead is nudity, blood, sadism, dismemberment, violence, and a soundtrack composed entirely of really bad folkish 70s songs. THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT was cheaply made, so it's lacking in the technical aspects and does no wonders in the artistic ones.It was based on THE VIRGIN SPRING by Ingmar Bergman, which I haven't seen, but it's got to be better than this. This is a drama about senseless murder that isn't character oriented enough to justify its approach and is simply too exploitive to be taken seriously. The conclusion is gory stuff, but it isn't enough to turn this into the ""horror classic"" it's been hailed as.I don't know how Wes Craven ever managed to have a career after this. A semi-sequel called THE HOUSE ON THE EDGE OF THE PARK was made six years later with one of the same actors and is actually slightly better than this. If you want to see an early Wes Craven film, THE HILLS HAVE EYES is better than this (don't expect THE GODFATHER, though). If you want good horror, don't see this.

By today's standards and budgets this is true.  It's this very quality, however, that makes it a horror gem.Shot in 16mm on a shoestring budget LHOTL has an eerie, reality-TV feel as you watch it.  The killers are horrible because there are no smug one-liners or scary movie cliches.  They are mortal and they make mortal mistakes. Krug is one scary character because the docudrama style of the film makes him more realistic.  His crimes are hideous and we see the victims suffer horrible deaths.  Not at all pleasant to watch because deep down the viewer knows this type of crime could really happen.The complete edition on DVD is fantastic with restored graphic footage cut upon its initial release.  The extras are the real story as you find out that Wes Craven and Sean Cunningham are intelligent filmmakers who knew what they were doing with this movie.  They wanted to shock and terrify.
It's also interesting to hear the interviews with the cast members and hear of their initial disgust with the script.Sure, LHOTL may look crude and a bit silly at first glance.

But even without those gory scenes, it was a lot more watchable than I thought. Yes, I would agree that watching the convicts taunt and bully the girls was effectively shot, tense and gripping. I would disagree that it was shocking or repulsive, maybe that is down to me being de-sensitized to horror movies. It was however, finely directed by Craven. He did a superb job in making the convicts appear evil, physcotic, cruel and absolutely remorseless...apart from the younger lad who was shown as being 'dragged along' by his elders. I thought the music was often ill-fitting to what was happening on screen, and the comedy thrown in was sometimes confusing ( the 2 policeman arguing with Ada the truck driver). But that may well be Craven's style, to throw you off balance and keep you watching. For me the best part was when the parents clock on to who their 'guests' really are, and set about a gruesome revenge.",The Last House on the Left
162,luke-346,Horrific!,10,11 June 2008,"Last House on the Left is one of the most notorious of the infamous Video Nasties that were banned in the UK during the early 1980's. It has achieved a large cult following and is revered by many horror fans. The film is the first feature by Wes Craven and is loosely based on Inger Bergman's 1960 film ""The Virgin Spring"". In brief the film centers on two girls, called Mari & Phyllis, who on their way to a rock concert are kidnapped by four recently escaped criminals. During their abduction they are raped, sexually humiliated, tortured, mutilated, disembowelled and finally murdered by their captors. Once the ordeal is over the criminals then look to a married couple they stumble upon for help and accommodation, it just so happens that this couple live in the last house on the left. It soon transpires that they are the parents of one of the girls murdered and unbeknown to the escaped criminals the parents execute a bloody revenge.Such is the notoriety of the film that upon its initial release in Britain in 1974, the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) gave it an outright ban with them making clear that cuts would make no difference. Not only was the film not allowed to be screened in Britain, but Canada, Australia and New Zealand also banned it. However, and as mentioned earlier, the film did manage to become available on video in the early 80's but this was before the Video Recordings Act in 1984. This Act led to it featuring predominantly on the Director of Public Prosecutions top 60 'Video Nasty' list. The film also managed to achieve 113 convictions under the Obscene Publication Act in the UK between 1983 and 1987; yes One Hundred and Thirteen! In 1999 the film was again submitted to the BBFC, but this time they demanded that over 2 minutes of cuts were required. The distributors, loyal to their work, declined and the film was rejected a release. It was then re-submitted in 2001, this time the BBFC demanded 16secs to be cut. The distributors appealed, but unfortunately lost and the BBFC (now clearly annoyed) upped it to 32 seconds. As far as I am aware the uncut version is still unavailable in the UK so those that wish to purchase a copy should visit an American online store.Controversy aside, it's worth taking note of the trailer for the film as it invites the viewer to relish the words ""It's only a movie, it's only a movie..."". In quintessential horror fashion the trailer teases the audience with its fiction; something that would later be parodied by Craven himself in ""Scream"". Those that have seen the film will understand how Last House on the Left is a film that embodies a deep and disturbing insight into the extremes of abduction and female humiliation. It is a horrific film and through being so horrific it perfectly epitomizes the very genre it is, a horror. I have huge admiration for this film, given its young director Wes Craven and producer (Sean S. Cunningham; Creator of the Friday 13th series) and the mere fact it really did push the boundaries of cinema. It can be argued that the acting is poor and the script bad, but the grittiness of the film stock combined with the poor acting and dialogue ironically make for a superb film, interestingly the very qualities that made Grindhouse cinema respected and adored.I have seen this film many times and from my experience women will find it hardest to watch. It is not a film for the faint hearted and it does not rely on heavy chords or lots of suspense. Its effectiveness lies in the simplicity of the story. Albeit a story that is hard to digest, due to perhaps audience members finding it difficult to differentiate themselves from those on screen i.e. it's all too real. Furthermore given the films year horror movie clichés are avoided, in fact they are established leading me to believe that in 1972 the film was ahead of its time.Finally I can't escape that the film was cut in the UK, cutting a film is comparable to obscuring part of painting, or tearing out pages of a book as it removes what the artist, writer or director intended which is ultimately restricting freedom of expression and freedom of speech. Those that do manage to get hold of an uncut copy could be disappointed as they might not have the patience for such an archetypal horror, as it does not live up to today's standards. However, horror connoisseurs, film academics and those that take a genuine interest in film and its history will probably be the only ones that will truly appreciate Last House on the Left and what it means to the modern horror.",The Last House on the Left
163,pocca,Those kooky killers!,5,25 October 2005,"The first and hopefully last film to combine graphic torture, slapstick and kazoo music. If the characters and situation had been just a little more over the top (and the rape and torture sequences less prolonged), the film might have worked as a sick John Waters-type comedy; if the heavy handed attempts at humour had been dropped it could have been a very effective slasher film. What we have, however, is an incongruous mixture of jokes and brutality. Some of the cruelest moments are accompanied by bouncy country tunes; when the police frantically try to flag down a car so they can save the kidnapped girls they are first refused assistance by a car full of hippies who give them the finger and later by a folksy chicken farmer who is casually amused by their pleading (was the counter-culture audience meant to find all this pig baiting hilarious?) And yet, the film has its moments. The matter of fact way in which the girls are humiliated gets under your skin and stays there. Wes Craven also manages to give his bumbling, loser psychos some degree of humanity. And the final thirty kazoo-less minutes in which the parents of one of the murdered girls turn on the killers are genuinely suspenseful and disturbing.A black comedy that doesn't really work, albeit one of some interest.",The Last House on the Left

The family ends up at the house of one of the girls & are summarily & predictably eliminated. Then end.

166,dracforever,"Disturbing, campy, cheezy, & dated all at once.",6,30 October 2020,"Let's face it, this movie is not a quality masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination. BUT you really need to take into consideration WHEN this was made. The subject matter is not something that was mainstream script fodder when this was made. So in that respect it was shocking for audiences to see these girls brutalized & murdered in a quasi-realistic manner. Also, exploitation films were popular in the '70's so why anyone would be surprised that there are elements of that in this film. That being said, I do find it a difficult watch for many reasons but not limited to the following; the quality is indy poor, the social commentary relevent then is obsolete & dated now, the acting is about as good as a porno house offering as is the musical score. So, before you judge this one too harshly, remember WHEN this movie was made and know that not all ""classics"" are meant to be timeless, instead choosing to be relevant to the ""when"" they released.",The Last House on the Left

Hard to believe it was made in the 70's it is terrifying now, back then people must've fainted. Seriously I had to repeat ""Its only a movie"" in some parts of the horrific torture scene. It felt so real and the fact that it is based on a true story made it even more frightening. Its about 2 teens, one who just turned 17, go on a trip to a Bloodlust concert in New York. To lighten up festivities they try to score some pot. Which leads them into the pit of 3 deranged escaped psychos and a dope fiend, JR. They think everything's cool, but then they are beaten and raped. Then the psychos tie up the 2 girls and put them in the trunk of their car and drive,then their car breaks, right near Mari's house. They decide to start the torture in the woods. They force one of the girls to pee her pants. Then she makes a run for it in a terrifying, nerve shredding scene. The killers catch her and she meets her gruesome end! Then they rape and torture Mari, pretend to let her go, then shoot her twice. After that the killers and JR. seek shelter. They go to the last house on the left. Mari's parents have no idea that the people they just welcomed in their home are the killers of their daughter. When they find they decide to exact bloody revenge. They set traps and lead each killer to a vicious and gruesome death, slowly and precisely exacting their anger and rage. You won't believe your eyes! Not for the faint of heart. If you enjoy films like ""Hostel"" and ""captivity"" this is your type of film. I warned you!

168,pearceduncan,"Inept, yet disturbing",8,8 September 2002,"Last House on the Left is a movie that's legendary for being disturbing, and in another camp legendary for being awful. I think it's both. The screenplay & direction by first-timer Wes Craven are very amateurish, and the comedy scenes are cringeworthy. A lot of the acting is poor, and the movie has an awkward structure and pace, as well as many huge credibility problems where the story depends on massive coincidences.And yet, it's one of the most disturbing movies I've ever seen, and manages to push its anti-violence message with amazing force. David Hess is excellent as the sadistic Krug, and although Sandra Cassel and Lucy Grantham are laughable in the early scenes, when the movie actually gets going their performances improve dramatically so that you can almost physically feel their terror.Although Craven has made a number of better written, directed and acted movies with much higher production values, I don't think he's equaled the impact of this shoddy, squalid little film. It's art, of a sort.",The Last House on the Left

The music was a little distracting at times.But this really kept my attention, and it does have some suspense. I love the low budget feel the movie has (of course, I know it was very low budget). What some people don't seem to realize is that something like this took guts to make back in 1972, and Wes Craven obviously has those guts. The movie is disturbing, raw, and yes, very grim.

You get a very sick feeling while watching and it feels good. And the reason you get a sick feeling is because you don't care about any of the characters and you might have fun watching the backward Mayberry like cops. I'm sorry to see that Wes Craven has fallen so far with Vampire in Brooklyn and putting his name on crap like They.

171,Kaliyugaforkix,If you should go into the woods today....,7,3 June 2011,"The cinematic equivalent of a swift kick to the nuts, Craven's debut is a leisurely stroll through human debasement, not soon forgotten by viewers, even those already hardened by thousands of hours of on-screen carnage.Two fun loving teens find themselves in a dilly of a pickle when a gang of crazed Perverts whisk them to a magical afternoon in the woods where were lucky enough to watch them be stripped, tortured, raped, mutilated (one over-enthused nut signs his name with knife-point on one heroine's chest) Then by contrived twist, the group find themselves guests of their victim's parents who enact a terrible, costly revenge....Amateurish, disgusting, repellent, depraved....and completely recommended. Cheap exploitation fare if not for one critical factor: Craven simply refuses to glimpse away. Instead, he turns the viewer's expectations upside down & gives them what they thought they wanted: a terrifying experience. He rubs our faces in the forest debauchery, exploring with an unflinching eye every aspect of the reality of violence, not the cartoon version found in your typical body-count movie. The viewer has the privilege of watching one girl crawl on the ground & writhe in agony as her captors watch attentively before finally gutting her and toying with her intestines. Are we having fun yet? Craven's lack of finesse is glaringly apparent, its clumsily put together but the bottom barrel approach works brilliantly once the torture starts. A glamorized presentation would only serve to distance us from the proceedings and thus insulate the brute impact of the scenario. Its schizophrenic tone is it's biggest drawback (slapstick buffoonery in a Rape/revenge flick?)but the abrupt shift from whimsical teenage antics to one thug ordering a girl to soil herself is jarring to say the least. Craven sets you up with idealistic 70's teeny-bopper fluff and then pulls the rug from under you, battering you senseless with his grindhouse imagery. Its ambush film-making at it's finest. No frantic editing, no flashy cinematography; just a documentary's unflinching view of depravity. Its brutally, callously efficient & not a lick of fun, nor kinetic-because its not supposed to be. This is an ordeal, not an amusement park ride. Those claiming moral bankruptcy have completely missed the point: Is it sick to show an actual approximation of such things? Many will just read that as a cop-out, but I don't think it is here. The killer's remorseful faces proceeding their dastardly deeds, equal measures shock & self disgust, really indicates there's something deeper going on than mere masturbation.John Q. public consumes on-screen mayhem with the fervor of skat-addicts snorting half of Columbia up their nostrils. We just love candy-coated chaos, the more insanely elaborate the better, but what 'Last House' does so deftly is bring it back down to a human scale and sincerely ask the audience ""Is this what you really want to see?"" I can't say I enjoyed it, at least not in any traditional sense, but to blame it for doing to good a job is retarded. 'Last House on the Left' is horrifying & flicks like it should be required viewing for de- sensitized screen addicts like me as a half-way accurate portrayal of senseless violence.A kick to the balls isn't fun, but it sure as hell wakes you up.",The Last House on the Left
172,IcarusMoon,Parents Worst Nightmare,7,18 June 2003,"Well the movie was okay, but there were still some down parts that got me annoyed through the entire film.  These were the music and the police men. Which, the only reason that i could understand their presence in this film would be to soften the blow of the images but instead they made the movie almost a joke and the by the end of the film it just felt like a really bad dental flows commercial.  The images are shocking and if you look at this movie with subtitles and without the audio off, I'll bet the movie will be more shocking than what it already is.  Also, the film looks very well done...for a college film.  Nevertheless, taking apart all this down sides, i understood what the director wanted the message to get across, and I won't doubt that this could be the worst nightmare that any parent could have.  I still think that the movie was good and the imagines will definitely stay with you for a while but I don't see any reason why a person would see this more than once.  A great cult classic, but not for me.Also, If you are an over protecting parent, do not see this film but if you are going to watch it anyway, then also watch 'The Virgin Suicides' ;).

173,standardbearer,91 minutes of nothing,1,14 April 2007,"IF you are a horror/exploitation fan, and you didn't see this one, you probably shouldn't watch it at all. Last house on the left wont bring anything new at all. Its hard to believe, that people has emotions about this movie. One find it Disturbing, other find it shocking, some feel sorry for the victims... well this film is about NOTHING. Its story doesn't go anywhere, it doesn't make any sense, it hasn't been directed well, edited well, or played well. And most importantly: its not gonna disturb you at all.First of all this is quite a bad story, and it has the worst possible script. Seems that the writer was drunk through the whole process, and no one checked the finished material. Okay, Craven's been young when doing this one, but its hard to believe that there've been a director to this one, for it seems like no one knows what to do on the screen or behind the camera. People are saying totally meaningless things, walking around on the screen without any reason, and so on. The editing is maybe the worst I've ever seen. I just cant imagine how bad could the edited (or even the heavily cut) version be. The way some scenes are following each other just doesn't make any sense! The film has no rhythm at all, and at least the half of the scenes are totally unnecessary, and souldve been cut out. Acting: There is no acting. There is David Hess, who's still the best slasher character ever, and he's cool. Thats it. Forget everyone else. They don't know what they do, or what should they do. They're just on the film for some reason, looking confused most times. Don't ask me why. Most Walruses surely have more talent in acting, then these people. What about the shocking value? There's no shocking value either. It has a quite short torture scene, and thats all. I'm sure you see much more disturbing things just by turning on the news. I don't thing that anyone got shocked from this not even in '72. All in all this is a balloon in a DVD case. It contains nothing but air.",The Last House on the Left
174,ReelBrew,"Two girls are abducted, tortured and raped while on their way to a concert. What ensues brings upon dire consequences for the suspects.",8,22 November 2015,"During the early 70's, exploitation films began to run the gamut of seedy, dilapidated theaters that were sprawled throughout cities. Featuring an extremely low budget, exploitation films captured an essence of the culture, one that began to emerge after the death of the late 60's summer of love. When The Last House on the Left was introduced to the public, it was advertised with the tagline ""to avoid fainting, keep repeating it's only a movieit's only a movie."" What Wes Craven presents to the audience with his first feature length film is a tacky, ultra-violent, and ultimately unnecessary foray into exploitation cinema, yet one that is sickeningly satisfying, helping change the face of cinema forever.Quickly establishing itself as a film with little morals, but with the potential for values, The Last House on the Left opens with the loving and caring family of the Collingwoods, whose house rests with woods on each side. On the eve of their daughter Mari's (Sandra Cassel) 17th birthday, her parents agree to let her attend a concert in the city with her friend Phyllis (Lucy Graham). Attempting to score some weed after the show, Phyllis encounters Junior (Marc Sheffler), the son of newly escaped convict Krug (David Hess), who has holed up in an apartment building along with fellow fugitives Sadie (Jeramie Rain) and Fred ""Weasel"" Podowski (Fred Lincoln). What follows is exactly what the films tagline wants you to begin repeating to yourself, ""it's only a movieit's only a movie."" Produced by Sean S. Cunningham, who would later direct one of the most quintessential slasher films of our time with Friday the 13th, The Last House on the Left is filmed with the exact low budget graininess that other exploitation films of its time are. One defining difference Wes Craven gives it is an immense sense of well being, established by the blossoming friendship of Mari and Phyllis. While I've certainly never discussed my newly developed testicles or how my body has really filled out over the past season with anyone, watching it being discussed by the two establishes innocence, one that only a woman and possibly her parents could truly feel. This innocence, aided by the loving care of Mr. and Mrs. Collingwood builds us up for the inevitable drop that comes with the young women encountering the gang of fugitives.What Wes Craven seems to labor too intensively on amidst the rape, torture, and ultra-violence is the supposed necessity to lighten the mood whenever the camera shifts away from the perversion in the woods. Given the seriousness and gravity of what is laid out in front of us, the film becomes less exploitative than it does tacky with the goofy, Three Stooge like behavior of the bumbling law men, played by Marshall Anker and Martin Kove. Mixed between cuts of oral rape, dismemberment, and shootings is a score, with pieces provided by David Hess himself, that detaches us from what has burrowed deep within our core, coming off like a B.J. Thomas mock.While remaining unnecessary with its representation of violence towards women, its poorly timed comedic cuts, and its misguided musical choice, The Last House on the Left has remained as significant as it did when it first hit low budget cinema in 1972. It's ability to stick with you long after the credits have rolled is a true testament to the strength and passion of its creators, playing as a true labor of love rather than a simple shock piece. What Wes Craven and Sean S. Cunningham have provided stands not only as a staple in exploitation cinema, but as a milestone in horror, paving the way for years of gore, screams, and macabre.",The Last House on the Left
175,thewag777,A courageous film to release,9,15 November 2009,"Wes Craven's got some nerve putting this thing out...I've got to hand it to him. And you'd have to have a lot of courage to try this film, and a strong stomach to make it through.This film is courageous because it pushes aside all sense of human decency and portrays the most horrible human behavior imaginable...and then plays all this light and funny music in the background. It's like, one minute, these teen girls are being violated and humiliated in the woods; and then the movie switches to these Barney Fife cops whose incompetence will have you laughing...then it's back to the sick stuff again and your stomach is turning.This movie will disturb you. It will disgust you, offend you, and make you think. This isn't merely shock, however. There is a moral to the story. Unlike many mindless slasher films, the villains have not entirely lost their humanity, not even Sadie. They do not laugh maniacally after torturing, raping, humiliating, and murdering their victims. No, they actually seem remorseful. The look in their faces was priceless. Then the look on the face of the vengeful parents...it says it all. Wes Craven is showing the darkest depths of the human soul...and no matter the cause, violence eats away at us. Well done Wes Craven! I wish I could go more into Krug's son, Junior, but I would be spoiling if I did. But I tell you now, some of the most disturbing aspects of this film involve that dysfunctional father son relationship.I give it a well earned 9 out of 10.

Having sat through this film in it's uncut form I can honestly say that I was not at any point shocked or disturbed by anything in this film. LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT is not an especially violent film nor an especially good one. The violence displayed here pales beside that shown in movies by Italian directors such as LUCIO FULCI and DARIO ARGENTO. The film is very dragged out and at times quite dull. It fails as a horror film because it is simply not scary. This film cannot hold a torch to the likes of THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE and it's huge cult status is totally undeserved. The sole ""virtue"" of this movie is the superb performance of David Hess as leading psycho Krug Stillo. An average exploitation movie, no more, no less. 6 out of 10.",The Last House on the Left

Having watched a version with only 16 seconds cut I have to say that while the events depicted in this film would in real life be deeply scary and repulsive, this film just isn't as extreme as the hype would suggest. I find it hard to believe that this film had 'grown men weeping'. There are a few MAJOR reasons why this film fails - dire dialogue, awful acting, and some totally incongruous 'comedy music' scenes. This film started life as an exploitation movie and that's all it is. It really isn't saying anything about violence, Vietnam, etc. at all, whatever the pseud-academics might say - it's just a shocker for shock's sake. There's nothing wrong with that but this is a low-budget first effort and it shows. It's not as realistically horrible as 'Henry' and not as gory as any number of films that have come along since.This is a noteworthy film simply because there had been nothing like it before. By the standards of the early 70's it was an extreme and very different film.

It's hard for me to believe that Craven and Cunningham were unaware of Herschel Gordon Lewis, who had been marketing intestine-yankers like /Blood Feast/ to rural drive-ins since the early 60s. If LHOTL goes beyond Lewis and other exploitation filmmakers, it is in the relative realism of the performances: David A. Hess is far more believable (and scarier) than anyone in /Blood Feast/. I believe it was ""Psychotronic"" magazine's Michael Weldon who said of the Lewis film ""if the acting had been as good as the effects it would have been impossible to watch."" In the end, /Last House/ is a cut above most exploitation movies, but it is still very much of that family: the humor is awkward, the exposition sometimes nonsensical and crude, and everyone in the movie looks as though they are covered with a thin film of lubricant.

180,prod74,Worth watching....,6,19 July 2004,"I have heard quite a lot about this movie and I've been wanting to watch for quite some time. Finally, it was released on dvd in Greece and when I saw it on the self of the dvd store I rented it. I was eager to see what all the fuss was about and I put the disc in the dvd player, sat comfortably on the couch and prepared myself to be blown away. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed. Not so much from the movie itself, but from the fact that the version I watched must be the most heavily cut version in existence. It was totally butchered, almost every scene was cut. I was left feeling I didn't watch the actual movie, just some selected parts. So, I don't really think I can properly review this movie, but I'll try to anyway.It is obvious that the budget was very tight and that Craven and Cunningham were not very experienced. The script is sometimes corny and even stupid, the direction and editing fail to impress and the music (composed by D. Hess who plays Krug, the main bad guy) is average at best. The acting, with the exception of D. Hess, is typical B-movie acting, although at some points the 2 girls look really scared. The main story is rather good - as far as revenge flicks go - but it could be better if some more attention was given to it. The cops, obviously meant as a comic relief detract from the movie. On top of all this, the version I watched was deprived of anything shocking, at least visually. So, with the main attraction of the movie gone, was it any good? Well, I can only speak for myself, but I'd have to say yes. Admittedly it's a badly made film, but I liked it. Even though the version I watched had almost none shocking or violent scenes, I still found it disturbing. Mostly because all the violence comes not from monsters, zombies, or super strong mutated killers, but from real people (from Krug's gang or from the parents). Krug and company do what they do without any motive, just because the can - just for fun, and the parents turn to killers for revenge. It was a strong movie and it stays with you for a while. As a conclusion, this movie has some flaws and it is definitely not a masterpiece, but as Craven's debut I think it's decent enough. Worth watching at least once, if only to see why it earned cult status.
P.S. I cannot believe that in 2004 a movie gets released in such a heavily censored form. I feel cheated and insulted.",The Last House on the Left

A few parts the acting was great, a few parts... not so much, but overall not too bad.The story was very ""the Virgin Spring""y'. I felt for Craven's first film he did a good job in creating the feel of ""the real"". Some poor transitions and a few oddball choices but overall not too bad there either.There are a few scenes with some great angles that I can't recall seeing in films before 1972 so I'd say Craven did some good work with a few key shots (last rape scene before gun shot).After checking a couple of pages of reviews I'm still shocked how many times I read through reviews here and see people calling random movies the ""WORST MOVIE EVER!"" in large bold font.

182,dung_rat,Pretty sick stuff...definitely disconcerting!,6,8 January 2002,"Not wishing to sound 'big-headed', I consider myself to be somewhat of a 'buff' when it comes to the horror genre. However, I must point out that I am NOT a fan, at all, of Wes Craven's work. I managed to hunt down a copy of 'Last House' a few months ago...and while it was somewhat grainy and old it didn't really seem to lessen the overall impact of the movie itself. Make no bones about it: this is one disturbing film, and in my opinion, probably unsurpassed for its sheer unpleasantness.I'm not going to run through the narrative (see it for yourself) but I guess I really want to focus on the effect that it had on me. 'Last House' came as a great shock to me. Having only seen brief clips of the film itself I got a vague grasp of what it was all about and I doubt, strongly, that nothing could have prepared me for what was to come. There is a touching quality to the story itself which, I feel, contributes to the overall shock-value of the film. By building a (very) brief relationship with the onscreen victims, Mari and Phyllis, the audience cannot help but feel upset and angered by their torture and eventual death(s), much in a similar way to, say, that of a close friend or family member. To make it worse, this also happens to be on Mari's birthday...and she's only 17; simply abominable! Who on earth could possibly comprehend being raped and then shot on their 17th birthday?! There is no blatant or logical motive for Mari or Phyllis' deaths, they did not break 'the rules' that Craven memorably lays down in 'Scream', apart from maybe trying to buy drugs (""dope""). In fact, both girls are more-or-less the epitome of the youth culture of 1960s America: Mari even sports a peace emblem round her neck.The film is realistic to an extent, yet laughable in places. The killers appear hyperbolic, simply for their warped minds and their practically relentless craving for the macabre. They do not have supernatural powers, like 'Jason Voorhees' or 'Freddy Kreuger' but are equally, if not more so, sinister. David Hess's performance as 'Krug' ( - he also played a similar role in Ruggero Doedato's 'House On The Edge of The Park') is a good example of this. Forget 'Leatherface', 'The Candyman', and 'Pinhead'...they all seem somewhat mild compared to 'Krug'. Perhaps this is where we become the most scared, of the 'real' and believable killer.What I found strange were the killings that occur at the end of the film (*SPOILER*). It seems unbelievable that a middle-aged couple could tackle a group of 4 psychotic criminals and win. The 'Collingwoods' (Mari's parents) kill their victims swiftly, unlike Krug and company. But there also appears to be an affinity between both parties.  But hey, this is a horror film! It makes you wonder who the real killers/victims are. This is also the case with Craven's next film 'The Hills Have Eyes'. Perhaps middle-class America isn't based merely around smiles and fortune.I believe I gave this film a '6'. 'Last House' isn't the best horror film that I have ever seen but for realism and the visceral feeling that I obtained this is a more-than-adequate grade. Like many other reviewers I also tended to feel ashamed for actually watching the killings, denoting that I was somehow part of it. To close I would just like to draw attention to the films musical score: it seems to coincide, almost perfectly, with what is happening onscreen. The fact that a sympathetic and tender score is played after Mari's rape makes us relate to her unfortunate violation and feel deeply saddened. Disconcerting stuff.",The Last House on the Left

The infamous rape revenge movie that caused movie goer's everywhere to utter the phrase ""It's only a movie...only a movie"". I think this was the first flick to really start the rape revenge theme, although it was sort of an unofficial remake of The Virgin Spring, an Ingmar Bergman film made 12 years previously. Being from the 70s, and part of the whole Grindhouse theme, this one really takes things to a whole new level of discomfort. Banned, and butchered by editors, I don't believe the intact version of the movie even exists?! Now that's extreme!So, we have Mari, a sweet teen and her friend Phyllis, who wanna go to a concert but decide to score some pot on the way. They meet up with some escaped convicts and... well... things go very bad very quickly and the convicts seek refuge... at Mari's parents house. And well, that's where the revenge part comes into it. Okay, I'll be honest, the first time I saw this movie, I hated it! I felt the pacing was way off, the soundtrack was terrible but the most unforgivable thing was the goofy cops, who were supposed to be the comic relief, but ended up just being infuriating! I actually still hate those cops with a passion, but I no longer hate the movie. I actually really admire it now. Here's why;The pacing. I was incorrect to say it was off. It's actually pretty awesome. It starts out as your typical B grade movie, but the middle section is some of the most disturbing cinema you'll ever see. It feels so real, almost like a documentary, you'll feel dirty just for watching it. And of course, the final act is back to B grade territory, and sure it's a bit silly, but it's satisfying none the less.David Hess. Mr Hess plays Krug, the main escaped convict and he just oozes with slime. One of the most memorable villains in a movie, it's no wonder that director Wes Craven will pay homage to the name in another, more popular Craven flick later down the track. Success in being disturbing. That middle section, as disturbing as it was, was ground breaking! The tag line ""just keep telling yourself is only a movie"" could not have been more relevant, as it felt so real. It's enough to make your skin crawl. This part was scary!The revenge. As over the top as it is, it's still a damn good revenge sequences, my favourite being the castration. If I'm going to watch poor girls being tortured, I sure as hell want a satisfying revenge sequence, and this delivers! So, final thoughts. This is actually a damn good movie. A shame that we will never have the full film, but damn, does it get nasty in parts. Highly recommended for lovers of exploitation and revenge films. Thankyou.",The Last House on the Left

Krug and the gang go on one hell of a rampage. Without spoiling by mid film you know your in for a serious ride. Some unsettling stuff goes down that to this day still makes me feel for those girls. Pretty intense stuff for its time. The remake of i spit on your grave 2010, is more up to date for those that need more blood and action.

186,BrianCTyler,Disturbing but very dramatic and kind of poetic,7,6 March 2006,"THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT (1972)directed by: Wes Cravenstarring: David Hess, Sandra Cassel, Lucy Grantham, and Marc Shefflerplot: Mari (Sandra Cassel) goes to the big city with her fun friend Phyllis (Lucy Grantham) to see a Bloodlust concert and score some good grass. Instead, they are abducted by Krug (David Hess) and his gang of brutal rapist/murderers. The gang takes them, drugged and tied up, to the woods which is ironically just across the street from Mari's house. After putting the girls through hell, the brutal gang takes refuge in Mari's house, and when her parents discover the brutal crime they have committed, they set up the perfect revenge plot!my thoughts: I am a fan of Wes Craven. He either makes his films nice and scary (A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, SCREAM), or just plain fun (SUMMER OF FEAR, CURSED). I have always wanted to see his two earlier films (this and THE HILLS HAVE EYES). I was not disappointed. The acting is great. I bought Sandra Cassel and Lucy Grantham as innocent fun loving teenagers; I bought David Hess, Fred J. Lincoln, and Jeramie Rain as brutal rapists and murders; and I bought Marc Sheffler as the conflicted, druggie son of the lead rapist. Although, I did think Gaylord St. James and Cynthia Carr could have done better as the caring parents turned into savage murderers. And the subplot with the dumb police was very pointless, it was only funny in the scene with Ada Washington.The deaths are also brutal. This gang of scums put these two girls through absolute hell, and then the parents put the gang through absolute hell. I almost had trouble sitting through the torture of Mari and Phyllis, but when the gang gets what they deserve, I think it was very poetic.Other high points are the atmosphere (I love horror movies taking place in the woods) and the music by David Hess (""The Road Leads to Nowhere"" is the shizit).Definitely check this out if you are a Wes Craven fan. It's interesting to see how he started out.",The Last House on the Left
187,craigboney,Scary disturbing and funny as hell,9,5 April 2001,"I knew nothing about this film before I saw it.  It starts amazingly well, with some rag-tag & bobtail acting in the early scenes which familiarise us with Mari.  Her father (played brilliantly in a one off film appearance by Gaylord St.James) fantastically portrays the inate potential for psychosis by manically observing his wife making a 17th Birthday cake for Mari.
I won't spoil anymore for anyone, because this is definitely a film where the less you know the better.  But suffice to say, the violence is done menacingly, but the whole film has a tremendous black humour to it which juxtaposes edgily in places with horrific scenes of rape and humiliation.Considering the tiny budget and limited resources, this is an absolute classic and a true gem.  The inept slapstick police are a comedy joy (including a future Karate Kid & Cagney+Lacey star in their midst), the music, which was done by the geezer who played the head psycho Krug is hippie period joy(especially the 'Road to Nowhere' song that pops up at opportune moments) and the film is short enough not to outstay its welcome.9/10 :)",The Last House on the Left

That's what makes it more terrifying.The Last House on the Left is a really interesting movie because its a rape movie, then it becomes a revenge movie.It wasn't as gory as people said it was, but it was very disturbing. The remake is gory and disturbing, and it's not as scary. This is one of Wes Craven's early movies, and he is really good at making horror very realistic-looking, especially A Nightmare on Elm Street, which is more supernatural. Overall, if you are craving an old style horror flick, then this is definitely one to check out because it has an indie feel to it, if you are looking for a cheesy gory slasher flick with not much of a plot, then look elsewhere.",The Last House on the Left
189,mario-rad,shock but not THE shock,8,1 April 2003,"O.K. So this suppose to be gore version of Bergman´s immortal master piece ""Virgin´s Spring"". Someone said that this is like one of the most shocking cinema experiences of all time. Yes, it´s shocking, but far from that status. For me, the acting in ""Last House on the left"" is so bad and laughable, that it ruined almost every possibility to consider this film ""the shock of the century"". And, I really couldn´t see the point of making a horror remake out of such a unique film, when the original itself was strong, frightening and powerful enough without a single blood spilled. But still, this one can hold on its own and, no matter that Craven is no Ingmar Bergman, ""Last House on the Left"" stands as a inspirational, disturbing achievement and a genuine dark satire of the 70´s. And its recommendable without any doubt.",The Last House on the Left
190,theeintolerablekidd,Horrific? Yes. A horrific waste of time...,2,17 May 2009,"Speechless... No... Let me gather my thoughts.... This was one of the worst films I've ever wasted my time on. My journey towards this film started with the remake of The Hills Have Eyes, I then watched the original which was worse, and then this. I was told by a friend it was pretty horrific and then after reading the same on here I thought twice about watching. I didn't really want to watch ""the most disturbing film I've ever seen"" as one reviewer called it, but I thought I'd watch it with a cultural viewpoint and braced myself.Two girls, Mari and Phyllis, set out from their suburban countryside home to travel to New York to see the band Blood Lust in concert. It's all very coming of age, hippyish, and lovely. Mari talks about her breasts getting fuller, she feels like a women. Great stuff... Here I guess Craven is trying to set the mood of innocence but instead what we get is an incredibly boring and annoying first 30mins flicking between the two girls and Mari's parents at home, some really f**king cringey irritating dross. What really ruined this for me is the Music. The soundtrack to this film was absolutely dreadful. We then get Mari and Phyllis arriving in NY were they decide they want to buy some weed and quickly get taken hostage by three deadly rapist murders and their moronic female accomplice. They are taunted, threatened with knives, knocked around, and then stuffed into the boat of a car, all the while to the most abysmal inappropriately placed slapstick comedy music ever. The film continues in the same manner.There were so many awful scenes I can't go thru them all, but one that really stood out is where they are in the woods and Phyllis tries to escape. She has a chance to leg it, and instead of running across the road to what happens to be Mari's parents house she runs in the opposite direction deeper into the forest!! We even have a frame where a road is clearly visible but instead of running for it she runs towards the river!!! All the while cutting back and forth between the girl's attempt to escape and the two bumping idiots, the Laurel and Hardy of the police force, the two most annoying cops ever to grace the silver screen, as they realise they've missed the chance to catch the murderers in some really pathetic comedic scenes. I don't know what Craven was aiming for here. It is beyond me. Is he trying to make us laugh, lighten up the mood? You sicko. I think the scenes with the cops are genuinely supposed to be funny, but they're not, they're just more crap layered on top of the crap we've already been given. I am talking about the scene with the chicken woman here... I could go on, there are so many idiotic lame scenes but I don't want to waste any more of my time.The whole thing is like a farce. I don't know if it is based on a true story as it claims at the beginning, I can not really be bothered to find out now. I don't want to waste any more of my life on this piece of s**t. If it is then shame on you Wes Craven, if it isn't then you should have spent longer on the script.The acting is appalling. Worse than Tromo, and they're not even trying to act seriously. Watch Phyllis as she Ohhs and Ahhs as her friend is cut up and raped.This violence in this film is not horrific, not by today's standards. I'm sure it probably was by early 70s standards but not by today's. Disturbing? No, we've seen worse. Horrifying? Yes, horrifying that anyone could call it a good movie. The beginning was dreadful, the middle was dreadful, and the end was dreadful. Clockwork Orange it ain't. Thanks",The Last House on the Left
191,latakiahaze,The Brady Bunch on acid,4,21 May 2010,"I really wanted to like this movie. Strangely, this was one of the infamous ""nasties"" of the 70s/80s which passed me by. Unusually too, I watched the sequel before seeing the original.I hate to say it but the sequel is a much better film: taut, brutal, full of suspense and downright unnerving. What can you say about this one? In a word - Amateur.The film simply doesn't know how to pitch itself. Yes, the violence is upsetting, and yes, the villains are suitably nasty lowlife scum. However, the movie refuses to engage the viewer on any coherent emotional level. Is this down to the poor acting, the cheesy soundtrack, or is it that Wes Craven hadn't really figured out what this film was supposed to be. It's really nothing like The Virgin Spring. Is it a satire on hometown America? Is it a dark allegory of the Vietnam war? Or is it, as I sadly suspect, a bit of a plodding mess? Last House can't even satiate the gorehounds. When the chainsaw comes out at the end I thought, at least we're going to see the chief protagonist get his suitably grisly comeuppance. I suspect the only reason the camera cut away was not due to any sense of taste or restraint but simply that the filmmakers knew that the special effects budget would simply make the scene absurd.But what really ruined the film for me was the ludicrous ""keystone cops"" sub-plot in which two inept lawmen attempt to hitch a ride on a overloaded poultry truck, slip and fall and throw their hats on the ground like something out of a Lauel & Hardy film. Was this banal attempt at humour an ironic juxtaposition, a dig at authority figures, or what??? You tell me.If The Devil made ""The Brady Bunch"" this would be it. The film falls woefully short of its promise (and its reputation). Go see the films that really deliver the goods: The Manson Family, The Devils Rejects et al.

192,baileygiannini,NOT TERRIBLE BUT NOT WES'S BEST.......,5,28 June 2018,"MOVIE REVIEWWes Craven has been and still is one of my favorite horror film writers and directors in the film industry. However, The Last House On The Last looked like he was in film school. Very amateur style and the one part that was great, was Wes's ability to tell a great story from his past literary writing experience. The film is dark and very serious. It lives up to its' R rating and I wonder at times how much they had to either cut out or tame down to avoid getting the X rating back them. It's not a horrible film by any means, but if you compare it to his other films, such: A Nightmare On Elm Street, Scream and The People Under The Stairs. Comparing Last House to his horror film in the 1980s, Shocker, Last House beats it by one hundred percent. If it was possible Shocker would get a half star from me. All in all Wes Craven's Last House On The Left does show that there was filmmaking talent inside of him. It was an amazing start for him. Lastly the cast wasn't really spectacular. It seems like the only way the acting was good, was that since this was Wes's first film both written and directed, Sean Cunningham probably had to help him out with the directing part a lot.

This pile of feces suddenly turns into a snuff film. Don't be fooled. This is a rapist fantasy for ugly men who hate women disguised as something of artistic merit.

194,djjimmyvespa,Sly social commentary on the absurdity of life,9,10 April 2006,"Last House On The Left is one of the most disturbing, bleak and harrowing films I've ever seen, largely thanks to the slow build-up. For the first half hour or so, Craven's film deals largely in stereotypes - the 'nice' family, the 'bad' girl, the sleazy villains who are blacker than black, the clumsy comic relief. You have no problems convincing yourself that it's only a movie. But when the thugs get those girls into the woods, Craven pulls the rug from under your feet. The going gets incredibly rough. The villains lose control in the worst way and try to pull it back by indulging in degenerate behaviour that shocks even themselves. When their playthings wind up dead, they react with a queasy combination of sorrow, regret and confusion, like children who've just dropped an ice-cream on the road. It's this middle section that provides the film with its formidable reputation. But there's more to it than that - as David Hess (who plays the ringleader of the thugs with chilling authority) has pointed out, Last House also points to the absurdity of the human condition. The only cops in town are lamebrained incompetents. The villains are amateur-night goons who resort to sickening violence when the slightest hindrance to their plans comes to light. The victims are helpless innocents whose suffering is magnified by the fact that it's all happening practically in their own back yard. The revenge - taken by one girl's whitecollar parents - is a clumsy, slipshod affair that succeeds more by accident than design. Everything in this film's moral universe is hopelessly askew, and Craven never misses a trick in showing us how and why it's the way it is, or in providing a window of understanding into how acts of callous violence occur. The film's shoddy technical credits only add to the convincing, documentary feel. If you like slick horror films that place awesome effects and cheap shocks above skin-crawling tension and food for thought, you'll hate Last House. If you're prepared for a dark night of the soul that'll haunt you for weeks to come, then you should go out and buy this film at once.",The Last House on the Left
195,NonSequiturL,A rough classic,6,16 September 2015,"Anyone reading this knows how much of an impact Wes Craven had on the world of horror. He was a legend, spawning not one but two genre icons in the form of Freddy Krueger and Ghostface. But many years before he terrified mainstream audiences, he hit it big with a nasty little piece of work known as Last House on the Left. This was Craven's first film, and was a collaboration with Sean S. Cunningham - the man who went on to create the Friday The 13th franchise.Made in a time when cinema was breaking all sorts of boundaries, Last House was originally intended as a hardcore film. During early production, Craven and Cunningham came to believe the project would be able to stand on its own legs without needing the support of adult cinemas, and they toned down its content before they began filming.While they may have toned down the sexual content, they certainly didn't shy away from nasty torturous violence. Many films lose their shock value over time as standards shift and audiences become more jaded. This phenomenon doesn't affect Last House at all. It's still just as grimy and unpleasant as it was back on release. The old adage applies here: they just don't make 'em like they used to.The film as a whole is amateurish, but there are shining moments of real terror here, and that's why it's had such a lasting effect and influence on everything that followed in its footsteps. The grainy film stock and cinéma vérité style lend to the filthy atmosphere in a way that slick, modern digital simply can't replicate. David Hess is excellent as Krug. Chillingly cold and intimidating. His cohorts played by Fred Lincoln and Jeramie Rain are equally unsettling, and their performances are good enough to make us forget they're not actual sadist criminals. But even with all of that praise, it's hard to call it genuinely ""good"". It wasn't exactly made with noble intentions. It's an exploitation film, and not a fantastically well made one. It has many of the same drawbacks as other low budget movies of the time. The writing isn't particularly good, and there's a completely out of place subplot featuring bumbling cops that could have been transplanted from a goofball comedy. The bizarre folk-ish music (written and performed by David Hess) is odd and distracting, even though it's certainly unique and is part of its time. It just doesn't gel with the film's brutality.It doesn't really feel fair to criticize it on its technical merits. It is what it is, and its modern day audience will appreciate it for that. If nothing else, Last House on The Left can be thanked for introducing the world to both Craven and Cunningham - men who went on to essentially run the slasher genre throughout the 1980s alongside fellow horror alumnus John Carpenter. It's an incredibly important classic, but it's a rough one in every single way.",The Last House on the Left

197,UlrikSander,A masterpiece exploration of violence,9,14 December 2007,"Wes Craven's ""The Last House on the Left"" is a masterpiece exploration of violence, and what it does to the human soul.This movie contains many a classic scene. The Krug-orders-Phillis-to-urinate-scene. The messing-with-organs-scene. The Mari-walks-into-the-water-and-gets-shot-scene. Not for the faint of heart! This movie is all about animal instinct. It could be argued that Krug, 'Weasel', and Sadie just follow their natural instincts. Killing, hunting, and playing with the victim are human instincts that are largely neglected in civilization today. All civilized thought patterns aside, is it healthy to neglect this side of ourselves.Craven does fail in the largely unnecessary comedic scenes, which seem hopelessly out of place. Most likely in the movie to counterweight for the violence scenes, their only success is tearing apart some of the terrifying atmosphere established by the aforementioned scenes.This is, however, not enough to destroy an otherwise fantastic movie. ""The Last House on the Left"" was probably the first movie to seriously explore the depths of the human soul via violence. Perhaps this is the success of the movie.

It certainly reflects the darkness and cynicism that is a huge part of the socio-political ""myth of the American seventies"". I actually wish that filmmakers these days would (perhaps) be allowed to be a fraction un-p.c., and also not take themselves too seriously; the people who made this film, pretensions aside, obviously did not.

200,Robin-97,The most flawed masterpiece of all time,10,7 September 1999,"""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" are two films that received a unanimous critical bashing when they were first released, but are now looked upon as ground-breaking horror masterpieces. That is also a classification that could be used to describe Wes Craven's ""Last House on the Left"", but after 27 years, the film still hasn't quite gotten the respect it deserves, and its greatness only seems to be recognized primarily among horror fans. While it is certainly not Craven's most polished film, I still consider it to be his best, and indeed, Craven has acknowledged many times that he doesn't even want to ATTEMPT to equal it. ""Last House"" was the first movie that aimed to show an audience what the REAL effects of violence were and the low-budget, documentary-like realism that Craven brought to the proceedings allows it to pack a bigger punch than a thousand professional studio films ever could. Yes, the movie has more than its fair share of flaws, but it is a measure of the film's power that one can easily overlook them. The most flawed masterpiece of all time may be a strange way to describe a film, but that would be an accurate way to describe ""Last House on the Left"".As virtually everyone knows, the basic plotline is a reworking of Ingmar Bergman's ""Virgin Spring"", but Craven does a superb job of translating the story's details to a 1970s setting. Two teenage girls, Mari (Sandra Cassel) and Phyllis (Lucy Grantham) go into the big city for a rock concert, only to encounter three of the most memorable villiains in film history: Krug (David Hess), Weasel (Fred Lincoln) and Sadie (Jeramie Rain), who are also accompanied by Krug's heroin-addicted, guilt-ridden son, Junior (Marc Sheffler). The gang of escaped convicts kidnap the girls and proceed to rape and murder them, but when they seek shelter at the nearest house, they are stunned to find that their hosts just happen to be Mari's parents - who unleash violent tendencies that they would have never thought possible once they discover that they are housing their daughter's killers.The long, painful section of the film where the killers torture and murder the girls is where ""Last House on the Left"" impresses the most. Before these scenes, the villains have been presented as normal, funny, almost likable individuals, which makes their despicable actions all the more shocking. Craven shoots the scenes of degradation with the raw feel of a documentary, and while this is mostly due to his minuscule budget and lack of filmmaking experience, it lends an uncomfortable air of authenticity to the events. He also demonstrates his ability to toy with the audience's emotions by intercutting the horror with slapstick scenes involving two inept cops who run into all sorts of misadventures while searching for Krug and his gang. While the idea of mixing the violence with humour is an effective one (and works well during some of his climactic scenes), the cop scenes are done in such broad, over-the-top fashion that they provide way too much of a contrast with the film's disturbing moments. However, when the girls' death scenes do occur, they are protracted and extremely intense, and during the rape and murder of Mari, the killers actually give off expressions of shock and remorse for what they have done. Back in 1972, this approach to screen violence was unheard-of.The outstanding work of the unknown cast is what makes the film as effective as it is. Cassel and Grantham make extremely believable and sympathetic victims, though the real acting honours go to the villains. Hess (who also composed the film's dated but often effective score) is truly remarkable in his role, making Krug into one of the most unforgettable screen psychopaths, and he is almost matched by veteran porn director Lincoln's surprisingly effective turn as Weasel, presenting him as a humorous, laid-back character that is capable of shocking, cold-blooded violence. But while the film is often quite disturbing, it also has plenty of entertainment value. When the violence is not being displayed, the tone is very tongue-in-cheek, as Craven provides plenty of sharp dialogue and effective bits of black humour. In particular, the infamous scene where Weasel meets his painful revenge from Mari's mother, and the dynamite dream sequence that precedes it, manage to be both shocking and oddly entertaining at the same time. But it is the film's anti-violence statement that makes ""Last House"" so memorable, as Craven does not allow his characters to feel any satisfaction for their vicious actions. This is easily one of the ten most important horror films of all time, and a real personal favourite of mine. It demands to finally be recognized as the true groundbreaking achievement that it is.",The Last House on the Left

Yes, it stretched the boundaries and paved the way for scenes in later movies, but it is not necessarily a masterpiece. Unfortunately, it suffered quite a bit from the era it was made in... the early 70's. This is seen in the often poor and strange soundtrack and the really horrible audio (although those problems are still often problems today).What this movie does very, very well is create suspense throughout. There are moments of relief, but they are few and far between. The suspense in this film is masterful.The comic relief provided by the sheriff and his deputy are often cartoonish and dumb, but fortunately, they are not seen much.This is probably not a movie I will watch again... just because there's better things I want to do with my time and more movies I would rather see... but I do appreciate the suspense this film brought me and the way it opened the doors for other films to come.",The Last House on the Left

203,mlwitvliet,You have to view this film in a certain way,8,18 October 2010,"I have seen a lot of comments on this movie so we wont have to tell the storyline anymore.I watched this movie and the first half of the movie disgusted me enormously. It shows there were sick people back in the seventies too so maybe this is given hope for the future. From the part that the parents found there daughter, it became shockingly unrealistic and it helped to get over the shocking scenes you get to see in the violence and rape scenes. It satisfies your revenge feelings against the three violators but nothing more than that and I question myself what the film would have become if it went like the first half to the end with the bad guys winning, which is normal to see in horror-movies.If I see the commentary here I don't think much people below thirty can understand why this film has become a cult classic. it was probably the first movie which showed twisted people, sex and violence so open and realistically so who cares about bad acting by some of the actors. You got something to see that was never shown before and I may only hope that it gave a lot of people an insight how sick some people can be. Now we are living in times that there is nothing new under the sun and it's almost impossible to impress people anymore because everything is pretty much done. I haven't seen the 2009 version yet, but seeing the trailer I think it's a better ENTERTAINMENT-movie to watch, with much better filming, acting and entertainment-music but it will never equal the realism shown in this movie because it looks like a home-made video.For closure; I really can't believe that there are people saying that they found the rape and violence scenes to boring for words. I personally think that if you can see a girl get raped and murdered like that without any emotion at all there is something seriously wrong with you and you need to taste something more of the real life instead of the movie-world with buckets of bloods and guts flying all over the screen.Giving this movie a vote is difficult because of the double message. You shouldn't like movies where people are raping and killing for fun, but as for the shock and gore way back in the seventies it gets 8 out of 10 from me",The Last House on the Left
204,gibbog,"Another ""shocking"" movie that was a let down....",6,1 March 2005,"***Spoilers contained in review*** With all the fuss surrounding ""The Last House On The Left"" I figured I'd better check it out. Well, while it was not a bad movie, I was terribly disappointed in the final result. Much the same with the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". I can see how both films were shocking for the time, and I guess siting here 30 years later it's easy to say I am not at all shocked by the content in either of these films. But I am not at all shocked. I guess that's a sad statement on today's society.LHOTL was a grainy, dirty movie. The characters of Krug, Weasel and Junior were slimy looking as well as being scummy people. I did find Krug to be a genuinely creepy character, but the character of Weasel came off more as a wanna-be henchman as opposed to a cold blooded maniac. The role of Junior was played rather effectively as well.As Wes Craven and Sean Cunningham say on the DVD commentary, they wanted to make a movie like no one had seen before. Back in 1972 I think they certainly accomplished that. But in the 33 years since LHOTL, it has lost a lot of it's shock value. Not to say that I condone rape, torture or any other type of abuse. I think even in movies that sometimes can be carried way too far.I couldn't help but feel that the two victims were not truly terrified. After a while it seemed they were becoming aware of their predicament, but I felt it took far too long for both of them to realize what their fate would be. It's as if they were just accepting the circumstances, even though they both tried escaping.Overall an interesting look at the darker side of humanity, but I felt that it could have used some fine tuning to make it even better.Rating: 6 out of 10",The Last House on the Left
205,ddfcmp8,Sheer Poetry of the GUT-CHURNING persuasion.,10,10 June 2006,"Now THIS is a real chiller that deserves the high recommendations it has acquired over the years. I am deeply surprised, and touched, that every generation seems to comprehend the film, and it's seriousness. Some people will not like it, most will wonder how, and why it was made. It is an ART film, an expression! Wes Craven said it himself. He was partially inspired by the violence of that time, what with Manson, Vietnam, and all other cases involving publicly viewed disturbance. He simply took the inspirations, and blended them with the makings of a good ol-fashioned revenge film, as those type of films were very popular in that day and age. You know what? Another thing he touches on, is the fact that a lot of the violence happened around people who were younger, and wanted to stand for peace: The ""Love Generation"", as character Estelle Collingwood says it. Still, the world was then, as is now, corrupt with violence, and violence only leads to more violence. This film cleverly shows us despair, humiliation, torture, and revenge, in an entire blood bath of ways. There is symbolism behind many of the moments. Parallelism between the two sides, good and bad. I look at this film as sheer poetry of the GUT-CHURNING persuasion, a very dark, but non-the-less real nightmare about the subject which parents fear, and the youth of America are oblivious to. Great film...GREAT film Mr Craven!",The Last House on the Left
206,ELB-6,What's the big deal?,1,8 January 2009,"I remember when Last House on the Left came out and the commercials urging audience members to repeat 'It's only a movie ... it's only a movie.' Back then I was not inclined to see horror films, and the movie looked far too bloody, dark and disturbing for my taste. So I avoided seeing it until last night. Maybe it was the years of build-up, or horror fan friends of mine saying this was the 'best horror movie EVER.' Maybe it's the fact that I've seen a lot of horror films in the past few years. But I found LHotL to be one of the dumbest things I've ever seen. Okay, okay, I know. It was 'seminal' in a lot of ways, and Wes Craven 'went on to do great things' (debatable) after this one. I know that the zeitgeist has changed dramatically since 1972, as has film technique/technology, acting styles and everything that goes along with and into making a film. I know that it was difficult to get funding and good actors for a film that was horror and showed bare breasts (two things that have been oddly paired in this kind of movie) back then. But come on. The acting is ridiculous, even when it's supposed to be 'real.' The script reads like something straight out of an 8th grader's English project. Two things I enjoyed: the songs in the soundtrack and the fact that it seems a real chainsaw is being used toward the end (you can see actual cuts on the chair and desk). I would recommend other movies far, far above this one if one wants to see 'the most disturbing horror film ever.' Into that category I would have to place 'Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer,' a movie that disturbed and haunted me for months after I'd seen it. I actually regret seeing it - it is that bleak and nihilistic. For a movie that blends comedy and horror one can not do better than Jodorowski's Santa Sangre, a gleeful, bloody, horrifying, hilarious Fellini-esquire take on the Psycho tale. For a dissolution of 'family values' done up in bloody horror one is much better off with Miike's 'Visitor Q.' (Be prepared if you rent and watch this one - there is virtually no social taboo not exploited in Visitor Q) For a similar (although much milder) and far superior movie from the same era, I recommend 'Homebodies.' But I have to say, all the comments praising Last House on the Left as being some sort of work of genius truly have me scratching my head. I found it hard to watch - not because it was disturbing, but because it was so darned bad.",The Last House on the Left

This work, however, seems not to be a horror film but an excessive portrayal of sickness and violence. It is a serious film of depravity which, if not art, should obviously be labeled as pornography. However, this is a fine line and I am not prepared to say which it is.I can say I was truly disgusted watching the scenes in this movie. This is obviously Craven's intent, and he has met his goal better than any other I know of. The problem is, I don't really like to be disgusted or sickened. Watching brutal murders and senseless violence should not appeal to anyone.

212,mikedonn71,"Like everything else in 1972, this film was politically charged - Spoilers below",9,11 March 2011,"I have a love hate relationship with LHOTL (1972). In some ways, it is an iconic film on par with the Exorcist (1973) and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) Oddly it's clear that Wes Craven was affected by the nascent feminism of the time. LHOTL works as polemic, because it makes the rapes seem at first titillating (bondage, lesbianism, etc.) and then excessively cruel. It plays on the sexism of the mostly hormonal demographic that watched grindhouse films.In the early 70s, everything had sociopolitical and cultural significance. Craven by amplifying the sexism, drugs, irresponsibility, anarchism, criminality (Manson family parallels in Krug Stillo's ""family"") and violence of the 1960s counterculture actually subverts the 60s. Clearly the Woodstock nation was a carcass by 1972 like Mari on her 17th birthday. The curse follows her peace necklace to Junior Stillo.The Exorcist (a critique of organized religion) and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (a vegan polemic) are both better films, but LHOTL came first.Things to expect that may cause you to want to avoid LHOTL: 1) slow, drawn out, graphic rape, torture and mutilation of two young (as in jail bait) teen girls; 2) two disembowelments: one by hand; the other by chainsaw; 3)castration by mastication (the 1st in cinema); 4) the first horror film where someone is dispatched with a chainsaw. LHOTL is one of those experiences that you have to witness yourself in order to judge.Don't be surprised if just the first couple of scenes make you want to take a long shower with Lava soap and a scrub brush. Even the film stock is grimy. Apparently people in the 70s didn't bathe or wash their clothes much.",The Last House on the Left

About 30 minutes of this movie puts any other slasher/goreflick to shame. Nothing about that forest scene says good cinema or will leave you with any feelings besides a piece of your soul leaving. It puts the incredibly painful, once in a life, watching of the squeal like a pig scene from Deliverance to shame. Besides that large chunk of the movie. Wes Craven tells a good story. Except he wanted to sicken people just to see how far he could go. He may have used some bull reason that it was an allegory for Vietnam. That's bull though. This was just schlock gore trying to see how far he could get away with. Finding a cut version (there are tons out there...

I watched the film and was bitterly disappointed at the reduction of quality compared to the 1985 Vestron Video I already owned. The new video was inferior, and was not only formatted to fit your TV, it was out of focus and left a great deal of the picture out of frame. The film itself is campy, with hokey country background score put the beat of an amateur production. There's two girls looking for pot that end up in the hands of four psychotic kidnaping perverts. Coincidentally, they are led to woods where the main girl lives, humiliated, and then led to their fates by the hands of disgusting criminals. The movie isn't as disturbing as ""Chainsaw Massacre"", or as gruesome as ""Henry: Portrait Of A Serial Killer"", but has a couple scenes that one might find rather unsettling.

216,cherootvendors,One great scene in search of a movie... One great scene in search of a movie... One great....,5,7 May 2011,"Every time I watch this movie (which is not often, I promise...) I want it to be so much better. But that one outstanding mid-section – the kidnapping, rape and murder of two teenage girls – is the whole basis for this film's entire reputation. And deservedly so: it is a sequence of undeniable skill and raw power. The rest of the film, however, is just not very good. Badly shot, badly written and with head-shakingly bad use of 'comic' relief, the film betrays the lack of experience in first time writer-director Wes Craven. Had the rest of the film been made in the style of that unforgettable midsection, we would probably be looking at a five-star rating now. Alas, it is never to be...The torture-rape-murder sequence certainly justifies that memorable tagline. The rough, grainy cinéma vérité style and that incredible 'performance' by Sandra Cassell really do give this the appearance of reality. I use inverted commas around the word performance since, if the stories are to be believed, Cassell was genuinely frightened and upset in that scene and it certainly shows. The moment when Grantham (the actress) calms and comforts Cassell (the actress) during their humiliation is heartrending and utterly harrowing, lending this scene an almost unbearable sense of tragedy and horror. Craven's use of a lachrymose ballad (penned by star Hess) merely adds to the effect, as does Hess's startling performance as sadistic thug Krug. (In fact, all of the principal actors with the exception of Sheffler are excellent.) Overall, this is a sequence that just gels, in spite of Craven's inexperience, and one that lingers in the mind long after watching it. Craven then (amazingly) tops this moment with a protracted and painful murder sequence in which Grantham is mutilated and disembowelled by the Manson-like group. Again, the realism of the scene hits you at gut level: raw, hand-held camera-work, ugly, messy special effects and convincing acting all round gives the moment an incredible punch.But from then on it's sadly downhill. Had Craven been allowed to have his scalpel-torture finale instead of the more Grand Guignol chainsaw one, then maybe this would have been a slightly more effective film. But as it is, The Last House on the Left is one truly great sequence surrounded by amateurish crap, albeit still preferable to the recent, crappier remake.Film: *** Nastiness: ****",The Last House on the Left
217,JRodFilms,One of the best,9,2 November 2006,"""Last House on the Left"" is one of the best and one of the very first horror movies. Taking a realistic approach, this film is about 2 teenage females looking to buy some grass before heading to a concert. Not using their judgement correctly, they are taken hostage, raped and murdered by a gang of escaped convicts. I don't want to spoil the rest of the story, but it takes an interesting turn after another. This film is dark and gritty, with a classic soundtrack, and believable performances. This film is also very ironic. Taking place during the peace and love generation, there is an evident battle between good and evil and who will reign. But most viewers wont even see this, but they will notice the dated look of the film. The only complaint is the during some sadistic parts, it is intercut with slapstick comedy. It may be confusing, and unsettling to some viewers, but it is one of the ironic moments this film takes.",The Last House on the Left
218,streetsofla,Craven's finest film to date.,10,27 February 2001,"This is without doubt Craven's finest film to date and its unlikely he will ever make a better film. Shot on a shoe string budget Craven and his partner Sean S Cunningham, the man behind Friday the 13th, have created an Ugly, disturbing but brilliantly made film. The Plot is loosely based upon an earlier film by a man named Ingmar Bergman called `the Virgin Spring', and that film is in turn based upon an old, Swedish legend about a girl who is on her way to church when a group of shepherds rape and kill her. Her parents soon hear about this and decide to take bloody revenge upon her killers. This is basically what `last house' is about. But once you scrape away the cheap looking surface you will find a film which underneath is a whole lot more complex and much more meaningful. Craven made this film as a metaphor for the recent war in Vietnam, and after the killing spree of infamous killer Charles Manson. The Vietnam symbolism can be seen with the girls parents, happy ordinary Americans, moving into uncharacteristic bouts of extreme violence in order to avenge their daughters death. Also after all the blood shed and carnage the parents have achieved nothing as their daughter is still dead. The film is also a complex study of serial killers, possibly the best(a long side ""Henry:Portrait of a serial killer""). Craven never for once lets the audience sympathise with the serial killers but does open a window of insight into how they have the power to kill. In one particularly, and possibly best in the whole film, scene the serial killers toy with the girls as if playing with a favourite toy but once the game gets out of hand the killers look down upon the carnage with sadden confusion as if their favourite toy has become broken. This film is also a very important one in the genre of horror, if that's what genre this incredibly complex film can be pigeon holed into. Before it there was only one horror film which dealt with serial killers and that was `Psycho', which came nearly 12 years before it. If you compare the two films together `Last House on the Left' is by far the scarier and, in my opinion, the best. `Psycho's' main killer, Norman Bates, lives along in a run down motel which no one ever visits. The killers in `Last House on the Left' don't live outside of society. These are people who could live just down the road from you, who on the surface seem like nice ordinary people but, without warning, are capable of lashing out in to such acts as torture, rape and murder. This is where the films true element of horror comes from, the people with in it who are out of control but are accepted by society, as Mari's parents accept the killers into their home, with open arms. To be fair this film does have it's faults. Krug, played by David Hess and Mari, played by Sandra Cassel turn in excellent performances. Mari's friend, Phyllis Stone and the other two serial killers turn in average performances. Mari's parents came straight from doing T.V soaps, and it shows. And the police men, well the less which is said about them the better is all I can say. The sound and picture quality are slightly poor, but which can be forgiven due to the films budget. And the sound track , written by lead actor David Hess, although good in parts, the song `The road leads to no-where' comes to mind, is generally too happy and for that reason unsuitable for the films content. But these are minor quibbles for an otherwise brilliant film which should be seen by all who is interested by the horror genre. But it is rather violent and disturbing film as the tag line suggests ` To avoid fainting keep repeating, it's only a movie, only a movie, only a movie'.",The Last House on the Left
219,Genevieve_X,Not a nice experience ... but art isn't always nice,10,30 July 2001,"I had heard a lot about this film before I saw it being a fan of horror, and also a film student who had spent significant time studying horror films. In Australia 'Last House on the Left' is not available - it was banned on release and this ban has never (to my knowledge) been lifted, so I obtained it though a mail-order pirate (sorry to Wes Craven for missing out on the royalties ... but you can blame the Australian censor for that).  It is not a nice film to watch.  It is violent, cruel and relentless - but it is important.  I recently saw 'American Nightmare', a documentary on American horror in the 60s and 70s and Wes Craven spoke about his feelings when he made 'Last House on the Left'.  He said that when it was made he was a very angry young man.  Scenes from the film were spliced together with a montage of scenes from the Vietnam war, the shooting of students at Penn State, the burning of blacks in the South of the US, and other horrific scenes.  Wes' anger at the society that he was living in, manifested itself into a violent and cruel film where two teenagers, who are going to see a rock band and trying to score pot (hippies?) are killed by a gang of psychotics.  A simple metaphor is that of the violent death of the sixties flower children ... and a death to innocence.  The second part of the film where we see average people, do violent things, is perhaps not so unlike taking an average American kid and sending him off to slaughter a bunch of Vietnamese. There really are countless metaphors in this film especially within the context of its time.  I don't recommend it for the faint hearted ...

You could watch it on mute and you wouldn't miss very much in terms of story. The plot is so simple that it just seems like the movie is dragging on and on. There are also a few story lines in the movie that are totally pointless and could easily be removed and the story wouldn't change: Mari's birthday, the cops, Ada (even though she is my favorite part), Mari and Phyllis' wander around town montage and probably we could spend less time with the badies and we would still understand their story via other sources (radio being one that was used). The characters are one dimensional and many of them appear once and in an almost comedic way. Which brings me to the tone....it's weird. It's filmed to be taken VERY seriously; the acting is very serious and the plot of the film is very serious. But then you have weird jovial music through the whole movie and you have plundering idiots for cops, and that awesome Ada lady with the chickens.

So many things have been said and written about this film and I know it has many fans who will defend till the end, but the acting is plain BAD. Krug is such a bad guy, it's almost laughable (I love the scene with the wee boy and the balloon!) and (I know it has been mentioned in earlier reviews...) what about these stupid cops!I've heard the new DVD edition comes with a commentary by Wes Craven and Sean S. Cunningham and I would love to hear them responding to some bizarre scenes. For example, The daughter is moving when her parents find her, and I was surprised to see that she was still alive (she is moving her head and her eyes). However, one second later her father says something like ""she's dead, there's nothing more we can do"".

While the idea of the film is unsettling in the abstract, the execution is dreadful.   The script is unconvincing and more than a little silly. 
There are  awful gaps in logic in the story. The events could, in theory, take place -- there are none of the supernatural hijinks that are so commonplace in other horror films --yet this one still requires almost total suspension of disbelief!The only thing that saves LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT from being a complete washout are a few deft touches; unsettling electronic music overtures and a handful of arty, evocative camera shots that settle over the inevitable carnage.Otherwise this is an average cheap-o slasher flick.

The film is strictly speaking a thriller, although people might be fooled into thinking it is a horror due to its association with director Wes Craven, and it's title which somehow implies something sinister (but the house actually has nothing to do with what transpires during the film).The scenes of violence are surprisingly unmoving - including rape scenes, and brutal cold-blooded executions. A chainsaw even makes an appearance. But it's all decidedly ho hum, and it shouldn't be. The terrible music doesn't help. One could also argue that the film was made in a much more conservative time, where the horror of death transpires off screen rather than in your face. There's nothing wrong with that (e.g. Blair Witch Project) - but it doesn't seem to work here. The character building scenes are also non-functional, and I found myself not caring what happened to any of the lead characters (good or bad).This film fails really to work at any level.

232,Allentoker,Wes Craven's best and most twisted movie,10,13 March 2007,"This is the most f@#$ed up American film ever made.Young Wes Craven must've had a lot of anger built up in him when he made this,either that or a lot of balls.And seeing that this is his first movie,I think that he has a lot of f@#$in guts.It's about two teenage girls trying to score some weed before a concert and end up being kidnapped by four whackos(one of them brilliantly played by David Hess)who take them out to the woods and systematically rape,torture,mutilate,and murder them. A nasty disembowelment scene is quite extreme.Then the whackos,who are on the run from the law,take refuge(accidentally) in one of the girls' house.And when the parents find out what happened they wreak bloody vengeance on them.David Hess Gets it with a f$#@ing chainsaw,and another whacko gets his penis bit off by the mother.What really makes this a disturbing movie,is not just the squeamish violence or the nasty rape and humiliation scenes,but the acting by both the victims and the whackos.Put that together with the gritty,documentary style film-making, and it makes you feel like your watching something real.One of my favorite things about this movie is the subtext of how sometimes normal people have to become as f@#$ed up and crazy as the whackos to survive. Watch out for the scene where David Hess makes one of the girls pee herself.Hess is extremely cold and especially evil in that specific scene.People who are used to the new,Hollywood style,pussified version of Wes Craven will be very put off.This(along with his second movie The Hills Have Eyes) is a very raw,bestial,primordial Wes Craven movie.It gets down to the real terrors that are out there in America today.It's a hard movie to watch,but if you can stomach it,it's also a very beautiful movie.Fans of Hostel:don't watch cause it'll make you cry.Everybody else:watch this f@#$ing movie,it's f#$%ing awesome.",The Last House on the Left
233,apres_vague,Keep repeating... It's only a masterpiece,10,20 February 2019,"Bergman's The Virgin Spring gets a makeover for the 70's, both in hairstyles and explicit content. The result is this raw and unapologetic slice of cinema nastiness.
The Last House on the Left has always been more of a black comedy at heart than a Horror film. With brilliant tongue-in-cheek humour running through it; underlined with David Hess' melodic songs and sarcastic use of nature shots.
A pair of teenage girls are trying to score weed but are captured by Krug (David Hess) and his Manson type family who torture, rape and eventually kill them in the forest. After leaving the girls for dead they move on and only by accident end up at one of the girl's parent's house.
Sadie (Jeramie Rain) is an iconic Horror chick, defying all cliché (she is neither a manipulated victim nor cold femme fatale) She's is just one of the boys.
People often complain about the slapstick subplot with the two cops; as a pointless comic relief that only interrupts the real happenings. And that is the point; the silly humour only deepens the sadistic edge to the violent scenes of rape and murder we have just witnessed. (It also reminds me about the two Cops gag in Edgar G. Ulmer's Horror classic The Black Cat.)
This might just be Wes Craven's finest film and I re-watch it at least once a year. The 2009 remake is absolutely terrible and has none of the charm the original has to offer. The same goes for all the other copycats over the years.",The Last House on the Left

But that's nothing compared to what happens when one of the girl's parents gets wind of this.While the technical side of this film is hard to praise, the story itself is fascinating and keeps you on your toes. It's incredibly disturbing, but it's hard to turn away except when the filmmakers feel the need to add poorly devised comedic relief in between the scenes of savagery. It's easy to see where they're coming from, but it's such a hard left turn in tone that it doesn't work and brings the quality of the film down.",The Last House on the Left
235,messin18,Horrible first half....Pretty good Last half.,5,14 December 2006,"This movie has horrible acting, it's cut poorly, and several scenes don't make sense. But the last half of the movie is uniquely creepy.Horrible Acting: Almost all of the performances are just plain bad. I've seen plenty of low budget horror movies with good acting so that is no excuse.Cut Poorly: There are several parts of the movie that should have been cut. There are three separate mentions to ""The phone is working now, glad you're phone is working now"" Without any back story to the phone ever not working in the first place.Also one of the scenes where a girl get stabs they cut back and suddenly she's in the middle of the woods by a tree... just a bad cut.Bad pacing: The first half of the movie builds NO atmosphere or creepiness. They keep cutting to doofy music. After a brutal rape and murder (that was acted so poorly didn't seem very brutal at all) they cut to some comedic goofy scene of two cops trying to ride in a truck full of chickens... talk about killing any sort of atmosphere.The last half: The last half of the movie actually gets better. The killers are staying with the parents of one of their victims. From this point on they atmosphere starts to build and it gets fairly creepy. They stop cutting to doofy music and it's actually pretty good.Overall it's a great idea for a movie. This is one that should be re-made with better actors and a better editor. I'd only recommend it for horror fans that are digging deep to find horror",The Last House on the Left

Even now the UK Censors will not give the film it's original uncut release and to be honest it may be just as well as it's pretty nasty stuff.The film has similarities with the likes of I Spit On Your Grave and Straw Dogs so you can imagine the sort of atmosphere you're in for.It's hard to comment on the acting skills of the amateurs that starred in this movie, it all seemed very real so i guess they pulled it off!",The Last House on the Left

There are plenty of things wrong with the movie: the low budget, the subpar acting, bad editing, etc. But I still find it shocking and effective. When I was a teenager, the local video store carried the film, but it was located with all the other cheesy horror films, so i never rented it. Plus the fact that my mom watched the movies with me.

They're right, but I think it is that way intentionally. Basically the story revolves around a bunch of cartoonish escaped convicts who suddenly become viciously cruel and kidnap two girls on their way to a concert. No film had really gone as far in its depiction of violence as this one when it was released, and by the time the credits rolled, I for one had a hard time shaking off the images. More jaded viewers may be disappointed by the lack of gore, or the absence of a masked killer (Last House is frequently compared to Texas Chainsaw...it is nothing like it).  A lot of people criticize the music in the film as being out of place. I thought it worked nicely as a counterpoint. I think what Wes Craven was going for in this film was kind of the shocking humor/horror vibe that Tarantino has sort of mastered in later years. It is an experiment that doesn't always work, but the violent scenes are so shocking that the flat humor won't really detract from the effect of the film. I thought Hess's music was great, and really captured the disillusion of the era. I'm also surprised I haven't seen the actress who played Mari Collingwood in any other films, she is really talented. In fact, her performance is what anchors the film in reality.",The Last House on the Left

Obviously Wes and his cronies were out to make a movie that did nothing but shock people.  Oh boy, there's creativity at it's finest!  (That was sarcasm.) No real thought in this movie at all.

241,Magnum-9,"Undeniably Disturbing, If Not Always Convincing(**SPOILERS**)",7,1 September 1999,"""Last House on the Left"" is just one of those films that is strictly an acquired taste.  95% of people who view this film downright hate it.  Well, those people are entitled, but you have to realize that 90% of the people who hate it still think it is sick, disturbing, and brutal.  Some people even find it upsetting.  And bearing in mind that it is STILL banned in many countries today, and STILL has the effect to disturb people that much, it must be a powerful picture.  But don't take my word for it.So I'm sure you've heard all kinds of messed up rumors about this movie. I'm sure you've been warned by a lot of people to stay away from it.  I'm sure you've probably even had the desire and curiosity to at least view this film, but couldn't find it anywhere.  Well, you're not in the minority.  The truth is that this film has such a bad reputation that it is inclined to be dumped on immediately, over and over again.  ""I Spit on Your Grave"" is another prime example of an underrated flick with a horrible rep, yet it is still highly watchable.  I don't agree with reviews from people who immediately jump to biased conclusions, or bite off of other people's reviews (an example: the phrase ""technically inept"", which was originally stated by Leonard Maltin, is repeated on numerous occasions by other reviewers on the Net).  When you read a review like that, your best bet would be to ignore it.So my feelings on this film are mixed in the extreme.  I'm not saying this is a great movie, I'm not saying you will enjoy this movie, I'm simply saying that this is one hell of a disturbing picture.  The first time is the most effective time to watch it.  It loses much of it's power with repeat viewings.  I must also warn you that some of the aspects of this film are extremely hokey.  The dialogue is horrible, the acting styles are none too admirable, and the character of Sadie is just plain ludicrous.  She was referred to as ""animal-like"", but the only animal that comes to mind is a kitty cat.  She's not the least bit threatening and she is the epitome of bad acting.  Ignore the flaws of her character and you'll roll with it just fine.  The story basically begins with the birthday of our main character Mari Collingwood, a pretty, innocent little teenager who is just turning seventeen.  Her parents are setting everything up for her party and everybody's all excited.  Mari decides that she is going to a Bloodlust concert with her pal Phyllis Stone, another pretty teenager who is unknown to the Collingwood family.  After the parents meet Phyllis, she and Mari leave briskly for the concert, having girl to girl chats along the way. This is Craven's way of making us feel for these two girls.  Mari talks of changing and her breasts filling out, so later on when the two are meeting their fates, this has a great effect on the audience, who is being bludgeoned with emotions.The two decide to try and score some pot from a guy on the street.  At first, he declines, but then it comes to him that his chance has arrived, so he invites the two into his corridor where his three colleagues are waiting in vain.  Now we know:  These are the vicious prison escapees we heard about earlier over the radio.  The guy ""with the pot"" is the meekly Junior, son of the other guy, the barbaric Krug, who got Junior hooked on heroine to control him.  The lady with the messed up hair is Sadie and the mean-looking fellow is Weasel, a mild-mannered lunatic.  The girls now realize that they are trapped.  Several of them put their hold on Phyllis, ripping her shirt off to expose her breasts, ready to ""have some fun"" with her.  Krug decides to punch her in the gut, causing her to fall to the floor where she is brutally gang raped off camera.  Mari has a (artificial) look of fright on her face as she watches in the corner.     So the next day the girls are placed in the killers' car trunk and driven away.  Once the car breaks down, the murderers decide to take them into the woods and ""have some fun"".  Mari quickly notices that these are the woods right outside her house.The killers quickly immerse themselves into self-gratification, asking Phyllis to urinate in her jeans or they'll cut Mari with a switchblade.  At first, she refuses, but once Krug cuts Mari, Phyllis calmly answers the order, making a point to call them ""sick mothers"".  Krug then orders her to remove her pants.  Laughing their asses off, the killers grow more sadistic. Krug gets the two together and orders Phyllis to punch Mari as hard as she can in the stomach.  They start to plead and Krug gets angry, but Junior steps in to save the day, stating that they should just ""make it with each other"" instead.  So the two are stripped down totally nude and forced to embarrass themselves in front of twisted psychopaths.  After that, Krug goes to the car to ""get something to cut firewood with"" and Phyllis nicely asks Weasel, smothered in ecstacy that he's now in charge, if she can put her clothes back on.  He says yes, she does and then bends down to whisper her escape plan to Mari.  Mari is crying heavily because Sadie is orally raping her (off camera).  That's all I have room to explain, since only 1000 words are permitted.  I wrote a complete review that will be posted on my incomplete web site (SEARCH: .44 Magnum Productions).  My advice is to quickly pick up a copy of this film and view it to make your own judgment.  Chances are that you'll hate it, but still be disturbed by it. *** outta ****",The Last House on the Left

The film does have 'difficult' subject matter, being rape, and the eventual revenge of her parents. But it doesn't really examine those issues. I found the wierdest thing about the film to be the odd soundtrack, and the comic relief of the two cops. These two elements should have been in a different film, as they never shared scenes with the girls story. The film uses a sentimental set-up, in as that the girls parents are home making a birthday cake for their little girl, whilst she is scoring dope before a rock concert. This is not presented in judgemental terms, she's a nice girl, full of life, likeable. The dope dealers are actually escaped con sadists. The girls are raped, tortured, killed. There is no gratuitous nudity, the rapes happen with a 'subtle' fadeout even. THAT shocked me, this is a video nasty! Still banned in Australia!

Giggled to myself at the music that did absolutely nothing to add to the horror of what was going on on the screen, in fact, it made it seem like I was watching a commercial for a banjo. Yes, I'll buy the banjo but the rest of the joke of a movie and joke of a horror atmosphere and joke of actors can stay in the dollar bargain bin thanks. Terrible soundtrack. Riled up zero emotions in me besides annoyance. Felt absolutely no pity for the two girls. No anger towards the group of misfits that commit the crimes towards the girls. No pity or sympathy towards the parents of one of the girls. I just did not care. Did not feel it. The acting was so bad, I was actually laughing throughout all the scenes that are supposed to horrify you, and the only horror I found with the whole thing was the pathetic acting and even more pathetic circus music that went with it. I don't care when it was made, I have seen movies from that same decade that are well done, so the age is no excuse for such a terrible movie.

The true horror of this film is Krug, played by David Hess.Another traumatic film experience that comes close to matching this one is the boat scene on Cape Fear. What makes all of these scenes so much more than horror is the plausibility factor: It could happen to you or to a woman you love. Another parallel to Cape Fear is the degree to which a horrible person can enter your own safety zone so easily.The 'Keystone Kops' aspect of the chase is the one flaw in the film.

Wes Craven's first film is interesting, but only to a horror fan-- or rather, those who enjoy the slasher films of the late 70s and 80s. Anyone else should avoid this movie, because you'll be wasting your time.The story revolves around two teenage friends, Mari and Phyllis, that run off to New York to see a concert. Unfortunately, while trying to score some drugs, the pair run into a gang of recently escaped criminals. Things go south from there... and eventually, through amazing coincidence, lead back to where the movie began-- then things start to get interesting.Before seeing this movie I had read the other comments here about the film being shocking; and up until about the last half hour, I thought most were overreacting. True, viewers are more jaded now and can handle more than they could back in 1972, but still, weaker viewers will find the climax of this film very unsettling. Things get a bit crazy that last half hour, and make the movie worth sitting through. I must admit, however, the events at the end of the film seemed a bit too coincidental and unbelievable, which took away from some of my enjoyment (but this is based on a true story?).The acting is horrible and you may sometimes wonder why you are watching this film, but, somehow, Craven keeps the film moving forward (with the possible exception of the scenes in the woods) towards its climax.

But when a movie like The Last House on the Left leaves you wondering if there's still any hope in humanity, then you have to read through its lines, bear its unbelievable dehumanization, and thank God that the second half of the movie is less than average, consisting of only cheap scenes of gore and violence. The first half however, especially at its end, is one of the most disturbing, depressing, and melancholic scenes in film history. Prepare yourself. And if you don't have a strong stomach to handle not only the gore but also the animalistic rape and torture of the two girls, Mari (Sandra Cassel) and Phyllis (Lucy Grantham), do yourself a favor and go watch Scream.Mari is a young girl, full of life. She has a friend, Phyllis, whom she admires and like your typical best of friends, they like to have a little fun, a little adventure perhaps.

Every last person from the school teacher to the garbage man is exceptionally good-looking, truck stop waitresses have nicer clothes and apartments and better teeth than you do, and people get the crap beat out of them without messing up their hair or tearing their designer threads. People even look great when when they're lying in their hospital deathbed or bleeding by the gallon in an alley. What's to be scared of? We know this isn't our world.That's why looking back at 'Last House on the Left' is such an excruciating shock, especially comparing it to any one of Wes Craven's latter films. It is alternately graphic and discreet, perfect in it's imperfection. When Phyllis Stone (Lucy Grantham)is beset from all sides getting stabbed by Krug and his cronies, her mouth drops open, her eyes roll back in her head, her knees give out; it is only her attackers holding her up that keeps her from crumbling.Stabbed repeatedly in the abdomen,her pants start to fall off; her goofy-looking underwear are a droopy fit, and you can see a faint trace of an unshaved bikini area. Her body is every bit as realistic as her response. It also isn't clear at what point she actually dies, and it seems like you can almost feel her pain. The whole way through, it all seems very much like what really happens in a crime of this sort, and how it would feel to actually be there.Part of this effect is due to the camera angle; not enough credit is given to how much cinematography dictates the narrative. Most movies have either an omniscient viewpoint, where the viewer seems to be on the inside looking out, or from the vantage point of one particular character, or alternating between different character's eye view. LHOL positions you on the outside looking in, like an unnoticed interloper. You can see what's happening and yet are helpless to act.Another element that makes the film so tremblingly smart is the characterization of the killers themselves- as normal people who just happen to be extremely violent, and you have no idea why. If you were to meet them, it seems, you wouldn't like them, but it probably wouldn't occur to you to be scared of them, either;they just seem like a bunch of goofy punks. That is, except, for David A. Hess's Krug Stillo, who comes of as just about the nastiest, most vile- and undoubtedly REAL- villain ever, with a certain crude, smirking animal sexiness that only serves to make him that much more threatening. (Hess, in fact, probably makes the movie).Although this film could have been done better- get rid of some of the cornier tunes and the lame comedy sequences with the bumbling, stupidly unfunny cops- it still manages to accomplish exactly what it was going for, which is more than can be said for about 80% of the films that have ever been made. Lets just hope that some starved-for-original-ideas horror pimp doesn't ruin a good thing by trying to remake it; cross your fingers.",The Last House on the Left
258,zoegraham-85551,one of the best films I will never watch again,7,6 September 2015,"I had put off watching this film despite hearing good things about until the death of horror maestro Wes Craven last week. Having read aspects of the plot online I wasn't sure, even after watching Gaspar Noe's Irreversible that I could handle The Last House on the Left. However after deciding I could not claim to be a Wes Craven fan without watching it I mentally prepared myself and put the film on. For starters I recommend that you avoid reading about the plot of this film before watching it, difficult as that may be due to its age and notoriety. This review does not contain huge spoilers but will cover some key plot points. So, the film begins. It is the most seventies thing I have ever seen, but not in a negative way. The cinematography is great and the characters are believable and likable. The film benefits from being made in this time period as it allows the film to take its time making the audience really get to know the characters - and had one not had prior knowledge of the film, it would be possible to believe it is a merry little film about two hippie friends having a great time going to a concert. We are also however introduced to the antagonists - radios in the background of scenes clueing us in to the escape of psychopathic criminal Krug and his family. We also see the family themselves lounging around in their home, which will later become the location for the disequilibrium in the film and the site at which Phyllis and Mari are taken hostage. Now to the infamous crux of the film, the rape scenes. Yes, they are uncomfortable, as they should be, however, Craven is careful to toe the line and never cross into sleaze or eroticism of the acts portrayed, in fact he even cut some of the forced lesbian scene after the film was finished as he believed he had gone too far. This is supposed to be horrible, and it is. These senses are long and painstaking to watch but necessary to sit through in order to appreciate the second act of the film. This is where I believe the film lets itself down a little, something I am not sure whether has been changed in the 2009 version. Maybe after watching the first half was too bloodthirsty, but personally I think that Krug and his gang did not suffer enough. The realisation my Mari's mother was not done particularly well and I didn't find their revenge to be equal to the crimes committed to their daughter and her friend. Having said that the idea was unique and brilliant to have the criminals end up at the parents house. Perhaps my view that the ending is not horrible enough shows that Wes Craven has made a film that garners such strong feelings in those that watch it that during the end scenes we are yelling for the dad to just starting chopping bits of of Krug with the chainsaw already. For some horror fans who have grown up on Saw and Hostel this may not seem like a typical 'horror' film, however it is a classic and it deserves to be revered as one. It is dated, (the music and shooting style, clothing, acting) but this does not detract from the horror and I can only imagine how shocking it was to audiences at the time. Well worth a watch if you are a fan of the genre, rape revenge films in general (Straw Dogs, I Spit on Your Grave...) or the director. It is one of the best films I will never watch again, and remember keep telling yourself ""It's only a movie"".",The Last House on the Left
259,DirtyGrainius,Dated Product Strongly Shows The Roots Of Terror..,6,20 September 2005,"Let me start by saying that this movie is a lot scarier to people over 30. Thats not saying it can't scare or disturb younger viewers, just that they have so much more to material to judge against. I'm 31, and I have just seen TLHOTL for the first time. Now, I can't say that it was bad, but I can say that it was different than I expected. It's not a horror movie, it's a terror movie. The soundtrack is dated, the film quality is weak, the acting is pretty corny. However, this is a low-budget affair, and at times the acting is fantastic, and the soundtrack does a lot to develop atmosphere, and also show contrast. Watching this movie, you can so see where where others in the terror genealogy come from from and fit in. You can definitely see shades of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", and ""Friday The 13th"" in this movie, and on those accounts alone it deserves respect. I have not seen ""I Spit On Your Grave"", or ""The House at The Edge of The Park"", or ""The Hills Have Eyes""(part 1), and would love to see them just to see where they fit in , in the scheme of things so to speak. I read or heard that Craven and Cunningham were told to gun for something that could rival and be ""exploited"", like Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"". Well, what they did was much more. They opened the door to movies where ""normal"" humans were the monsters, not zombies(Which are my favorite), or space creatures, or humans controlled by supernatural or extraordinary means. No matter how critical one can be about the production of TLHOTL, it is definitely a classic if even based on that fact alone.Now I know that some people will say that there were other foreign films that were predecessors and blah blah blah. Let me ask you, how available were they in 1972? Are you only even able to ask that question because this is 2005? Exactly. All this leads back to this being scarier and more disturbing for older viewers. J-Horror, Internet Porn, changes in social norms have rendered some of the themes in the movies, not so brazen and bizarre in present times. A movie like ""Audition""(""Odishon""-J) has a much more disturbing type of violence, not to mention isolation. Which, as my next point, is something done better by G.A. Romero, and especially John Carpenter(who can create a sense of isolation in the middle of a major city). And we have easier access to all types of films and media from all different types of places in general. That all being said,l TLHOTL is still a grass roots classic of this style of cinema which has impact and influence thirty years later.",The Last House on the Left
260,anticaria,disappointing,4,20 August 2005,"first, let me say that i truly had high hopes for this movie. having said that, i was primarily disappointed with what i saw. i expected to see a landmark horror film along the same historic lines as 'the Texas chainsaw massacre,' yet the movie i saw was not only not shocking by today's standards, it was also much too amateurishly executed to be effective. and again, let me admit right up front that i was perfectly willing to not look at it with overtly critical eyes, but rather with an eye for the 'overall effect' as it were. still i came away feeling i had been taken for a very foolish ride. so much so that i ultimately began to wonder whether mr craven had originally intended to actually film a darkly humorous 'parody' of a horror film or a horror film proper. i tend to think mr craven was merely aiming to amuse us with parody, not so much shock us. i concur with another reviewer who found the music and the sheriff and deputy's antics way too pointlessly corny and irrelevant to the overall effect. in terms of actual 'shock value,' i found the movie severely lacking once again, and i must conclude that if a film claims to be hailed as a horror classic, it must manage to at least shock the audience to some degree. the shock value in this film, while minuscule, was rendered even more laughable by the amateurish direction. a horror classic should be timelessly classic; meaning it should stand the test of time, such as 'texas chainsaw massacre' still manages to do this many years after it was filmed. in the case of 'last house,' the shock value only begins to raise an unwilling eyebrow IF one puts it in the context of the time period in which it was filmed. again, that is a huge flaw of the film: it does not stand the test of time. now, having said that, i am willing to concede that this movie must be viewed as historically daring in the way it attempted to create something innovative and fresh within the horror genre. too bad the end result couldn't be scary. i think we do the film justice if we view it merely as a parody of a horror film, and not as a horror film proper.",The Last House on the Left

Had to pause and walk away, like the stabbing scene at pond, it was kinda sick, not my style of horror, too real and graphic. Although payback was achieved by mom & dad after finding bloody clothes. Based off a true crime in NYC by hypes and degenerates. It made headlines. Better than remake as originals mostly are. If being scared and shocked is your thing you might consider this ultra violent film. There's no dull moments or filler. Just in your face brutal violence and sadness for the two young innocent girls who get duped thinking they are buying some weed. Classic Early 1970s Shock Horror !",The Last House on the Left
262,Paul-116,An MGM hatchet job,7,18 January 2001,"Just seen the latest video version of the film. What a mess. Most of the good stuff was cut out. OK, it's not a very good film anyway, but this MGM watered down version didn't even give it a chance. What good is an exploitation movie without the exploitation? Avoid this R rated version and see the un-cut version instead. There's a French Region 2 DVD version out there somewhere (French sub-titles).",The Last House on the Left
263,oldskool84,A very disturbing film but not that scary,6,11 September 2003,"Last House on the Left is Wes Craven's directorial debut and hailed as one of the scariest horror films ever made. It's a very disturbing film but not as scary as I expected. The subplot about the cops is really uninteresting and the dialogue is very bad at times. I'm not too sure about the acting of the criminals, they fit the profile but I never feel they're that menacing. I don't even want to comment on the performances of the parents, it's that bad. The best performance (if you want to call it that) of the film is by Sandra Cassel who plays Mari. You can tell she is truly scared out of her mind. As they said in the DVD documentary, ""she takes method acting to another level.""   What I admirer about the movie is that it never pulls back, it takes it story all the way. Some may call it exploitive but the violence is never glamorized. I like the fact that the criminals are portrayed as still having some humanity and that Mari's parents are shown as having an evil side. I hate it when a revenge picture celebrates the victim's vengeance. I think when a human being succumbs to that evil side it should never be treated as a good thing but a sad and unfortunate event. The parent's killing of the murderers is the most frightening moment and most compelling aspect of Last House on the Left.",The Last House on the Left
264,pizzapooch-2,"Possibly the most pointless ""Nasty"" ever made!",2,9 December 2000,"Having heard all about this classic ""Video Nasty"", I got hold of it on DVD. Yet, after the 81 minute run time, I was left with only one question: ""Why?"". Why was this labelled a ""Nasty"", when so little is shown, even in comparison to some modern-day horror films? Why does everyone else call it a genre classic, when it is so ineptly acted, with such a dire script and such lame effects? Well, I guess only Wes Craven and Sean Cunningham can answer those. What this movie is, is pointless, crass and simply downright pathetic. The gore is limited, and what little you can see through the ""raw"" photography, is obviously fake. David Hess looks less like a psychopath, and more like a slightly-mad drugged-up hippie! And the finale, is simply lame! Forget this dire movie, and let it be consigned to history forever. I can't even say that this movie has the exploitation factor, going in its favour, as there is simply nothing exceptionally exploitive that is shown, that hasn't appeared so many times before in other ""Nasties""! For those of you who want to see something at least remotely plausable, and even genuinely unsettling, go for Meir Zarchi's much-reviled ""I Spit On Your Grave"". At least that film has the redeeming factor of being worth discussing for its pro-woman or anti-woman viewpoint!

I clearly remember the eerie feeling I got when I saw the ads, either televised or printed.  Yet, as eerie as they were, nothing in the ads ever prepared me for this movie. I felt helpless during the film because nothing I could do would help the characters on-screen.  I was terrified by man's cruelty to man.  I still continue to be haunted by this film.  The feeling one experiences viewing this film can only be compared to what a jury feels when video evidence is presented.  With that said, I have to admit this is a great film.  To evoke such feelings in an audience using actors and actresses is a work of great talent.

267,rml530,cool movie,8,27 April 2001,"This is a very effective little movie for those who can handle it.  I personally find the movie more funny than I do scary though.  To really get the feel for this movie, try to find the uncut version which has some major differences from the toned down version.SPOLIERS:This movie starts off with Mari Collingwood taking a shower.  We hear from the mailman that today is her 17th birthday.  Afterwards we find she is going to a concert with her friend Phyliss, who comes from the neighborhood where the concert is taking place. Phyliss is from that side of town and is used to the wicked ways of the world, while Mari is the innocent one. While on their way to the concert, they hear on the radio that convict Krug Stillo has escaped custody with some other people including ""an animal like woman who kicked a dog death when it was deployed to try and capture them"". It's these things that make up this movie. So anyways, they go to the concert and afterwards decided to get some ""grass"".  Meanwhile, Krug and his gang (Weasel, a sex offender, Saide, the animal-like woman, and Junior Stillo, Krug's son whom he has hooked on herion) are hiding out, and Saide has refused to have sex with either Krug or Weasel until they get some more women.  So off Junior goes, jonesin to get his fix, out on the street. Marie and Phyliss decide to talk to him about getting some grass.  They end back up at the hideout where Phyliss is raped by the gang, with the exception of Junior.The next day they put the girls in the trunk of their car, and off they go, joyriding to some hippie music.  Listen closely to this happy-go-lucky toon. It has to be one of the funniest songs ever in the context it is used.  It talks about the Stillo gang driving around with nothing do and how they are going to have fun with these two little children.  Another example of the humor in this film.   Anyways, the girls are humilated and raped, and killed.  In these scenes, the music that is played is very effecitve.  And the part where Mari is killed is very sad.  After her rape, her innoncense is gone.  Look closely during this scene, the killers are remorseful about what they have done to her.  ANd so she is mercifully killed in a gut-wrenching scene, not because of it's violence, but because of it's melancholy.Now on to ACT III.  Here the killers ask the parents of Mari to let them spend the night, unware of them being Mari's parents.  Weasel immeadetly takes a liking to Mari's mother.  Watch the part where he stands up in front of her, and she looks to the side, like ""what the hell is that all about?"", another classic humorous moment in the film.  Soon after all this comes a very funny dinner scene where Sadie is drinking wine like it was beer. After dinner, Ms. Collingwood sees that Junior is wearing a necklace given to Mari for her b-day.  At this point in the film Mr. and Mrs. Collingwood use their psychic powers to determine that Mari's body is at the lake. They go to her still breathing, moving body (which is one of the film's flaws) and take her body back to their house.  Then they kill off the Stillo gang. The part where Weasel gets his is one of the all time great scenes in movie history.Now where it sounds like I was bashing this film in some parts, I was. But I do love this movie and think that it is very effective.  I know I didn't mention the parts about the sheriff b\c I 'msure you've  seen enough dumb cops in movies to last you a lifetime, and I'm trying to get the horrifying site of the chicken truck driver out of my mind.  Anyways, it's a very good, above average horror movie because the characters of the villians are very well done, especially Weasel.  Poor Weasel.I give LHOTL 8 out of 10.",The Last House on the Left

269,precordsp,Scary?NO. Silly? YES!,4,31 October 2008,"''The Last House on the Left'' was one of those movie that embarked on the screens after fuss in Vietnam, in time when American were still in some sort of trauma after the war, so, this movie can be considered as something disturbing and let's say obscene for that time, but generally, this movie is just another of USA's mediocre thrillers from '70's. This is not a horror, there aren't vampires, zombies, what we have here is a bunch of junkies, two dull girl, two stupid cops and too much ''clever and smart'' wife and husband, actually father and mother of one of the dull girls.Scenes of horror, have morbid atmosphere, but nothing more, there aren't any scary or too much perverted scenes as some people would say, there is nothing to be afraid of, really. The guys which plays those of the Krug's gang are silly, dull and hilarious.David A. Hess, who plays the leader of the gang have so much warm and kind face, that even when he slaughter's his victim, he look positive. Taking him for the leading role of the leading gang member is a miss big time.Character of Weasel, played by Fred J. Lincoln is also the dumb selection for that role. His look is so inconclusive and lazy, that there's no any spot in which you can find this character psychotic and mean as movie wants to show him.Again, there is Marc Sheffler who plays Junior Stillo, son of Krug Stillo. His character may be the funniest of all. With his dull and idiotic lines who looks like he was jumped up from some Woodie Allen movies.Gee.Okay, enough with characters, let's say something about the movie. Even that this movie contains violence and some little amount of gore, there are lots of cheap comedy elements, cartoon like situations, and silly songs played in the background of the scenes.

I was recommended this movie and was deeply disappointed. I did finish it, but it took real self control to make myself sit through this terribly outdated movie that was probably less that average in its day. I am not sure it would need more than eight or ten minutes cut out to be ready for non-cable television.It does however have a great storyline. I do recommend it for a remake. Look at the comparison between ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" of 1974 and the more current 2003 remake and the same for ""Night of the Living Dead"" from 1968 vs. the later more modern 1990 version.

(Went with some teenagers to a drive in, hid under some coats to get in). The one thing I claim is a photographic memory, so I recall a lot which was not in the 84 minute DVD I just previewed.That seven minutes or so of cut footage mainly came from the scenes in the woods, and had a big impact on the film's violence content. I won't go into that, since there is apparently no way to prove what I saw, so I will have to review the version most of us have seen. I will curse the censors who carved this film up, as those missing scenes take a lot of the impact away.Many have excoriated the acting, but I was impressed by David Hess and the rest of the ""gang"". I felt they played their parts to perfection, and one must remember, even in high budget films of the '70's, there was a certain cheesiness to most films of that era. (Deliverance being a notable exception.) The musical score worked for me; The tracks ""Wait for the Rain"" and ""Now you're all alone"" in particular were very despondent, and fit the hopeless theme very well.The low budget, documentary style actually helped the movie. After all, it's a snuff flick at heart. Hard for some to watch maybe, but I appreciate films that allow me to explore my dark side. There's plenty of dark side to view here.

Personally, I found that dinner scene of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre far more disturbing. I found the violence in Natural Born Killers much more distressing. To me, this film has been hyped up far too much.In reality, this film is a reasonably gory, unpleasant, yet bland kidnapping movie. You never actually see a knife enter the skin (like you do in quite a few films these days), most of the acting is laughable, and there are very few scary moments.Some of the scenes of a sexual nature are indeed unpleasant, but there are much more graphic films than that out there!I can't see why this film has been banned for as long as it has.

Disappointing for a Wes Craven film.  Trust me-- from a guy who always seems to enjoy a movie in some way, don't rent this piece of junk.  You're better off with the direct-to-video bad horror ""Uncle Sam.""  At least it's got Isaac Hayes.",The Last House on the Left
281,juanito306,excellent movie,8,15 April 2003,"My interest for The Last House On The Left began when I was reading some thematic books about the best and worst horror movies. Just the name of the film caught my attention, and what there was said about it really impressed me: kidnapping, torture, humiliation , rape, and murder. And all that in 1972, even before the first great horror movie: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre!So I started to investigate how to find it. But in my country it's impossible to find the movie in regular video stores, and there is no DVD edition or something. After a couple months after, I gave up. There was impossible. But looking through on-line stores for a copy of William Lustig's 'Maniac', I founded that TLHOTL had VHS edition (Manga Films), so I ordered it, sit and waited for the great movie, the one that you better repeat yourself that was just 'only a movie, only a movie' to avoid fainting. The VHS finally arrived. It was midnight when I plugged in the TV and hold strong to my chair: I was going to see almost a 'snuff movie'!! (that's what some people said here in IMDb). Oh my God, I was scared even before I push play.80 minutes after. The best word that my short English could find is 'disappointed'. I started to think why you always expect something you never finally get? That's how I felt. But that was the first impression.Someone said here before: this movie stays with you days and days. This was true, and the real and complete opinion of the film came to me after hours of cold sweat provoked by... some band of murderers? The film is excellent. Yes, yes, I've read every one of the opinions here in IMDb and in other film forums, and almost all the people who has seen it says the same: 'bad acting, ridicule plot, impossible situations and coincidences, horrible music...' That's all true. So, why do I say that this 'piece of c**p' is 'excellent'? It's almost irrational, unexplainable, because all the negative critics are right, the most part of the movie is just bad, but if we always judge a film in terms of quality and delicate perfection, I think we'll see movies very beautiful in form but empty in contents. The most important thing here is that this movie goes further in terms of brutality or deprivations that almost all movies I've seen before. I mean, could you name 5 more disturbing movies? Maybe I could say just two or three. And it's 31 years old!! Now in 2003 I cannot even find a movie that scares, or disturbs, or just impress. This movie does. So it's clear that if we get sick with this movie now, just imagine it 31 years ago. That's enough to consider it an important horror movie. And if you, who read this, don't like the movie, don't worry: almost nobody does. Maybe that's part of it's charm.",The Last House on the Left

I rented this today as I am on a Wes Craven kick having watched Hills Have Eyes this past weekend.This film is disturbing and it looks like Rob Zombie's DEVILS REJECTS will be in the same tradition as this film was back in the 70's. I love the grittiness of the film and also the soundtrack.NOW SOME SPOILERS Things that bothered me while I watched it again is that one of the girls had a chance to escape but instead wasted her time talking to Junior.Also the mother giving one of the sickos fellatio made absolutely no sense. Why would she do that? I was expecting her to rip it off with the zipper but she actually went down on him - now that is just stupid.Overall this movie is good for what it was in this time period. Most disturbing movie I have ever seen? No. Check out THE UNTOLD STORY to see some sick flick - if you are into that. I stomached it once - that was it.,The Last House on the Left

Also if the killers were murderers who escaped prison, every law enforcement official in the country would be looking for them...that being the case, why would they waste all this time torturing and killing a couple of teenage bimbos?...What would be the point?...i think in real life, the killers would either be hiding or trying desperately to get out of the country.....Lastly, why were there so many movies made in the 70s like this one, which portray the police as stupid, bumbling, clumsy, redneck, keystone-type cops?..is that really how people saw law enforcement as being back then?...the problems with this movie are never ending....it obviously is NOT well written and the story was NOT very well thought out....",The Last House on the Left
284,cliffo88,"A sadistic, vile and primal piece of filmmaking",8,30 April 2011,"""To avoid fainting keep repeating, it's only a movie (add infinity)"", so reads the tagline of this grim, gruesome and extremely notorious of B seventies horrors. Dreamt up by now legendary screen shock veterans Wes Craven and Sean S. Cunningham Last House on the Left (cool title) is a sick little tale, shot with documentarian realism, of rape, mutilation and bloody revenge set in a rural American countryside. The blood splatters just like in any decent horror then or now but, for me, the torture and humiliation inflicted on two young girls on the cusp of womanhood by Krug & Company are what sickens the most about this film (although the penis munching scene makes me want to cross my legs each time I 'see it' - nothing is actually shown; the imagination making up the rest). As mentioned, the film is shot using a documentary style approach, making the viewer (voyeur?) watch on, close enough for the blood to splash the face but powerless to stop the violence being witnessed on screen. Craven actually takes the central idea from Ingmar Bergman's The Virgin Spring (without the divine miracle ending) and so exposes a terrifying sub-strata of life that society at the time was not used, or ready to be exposed to but was lurking beneath the surface and occasionally reared it's ugly head (there's a bit of the Manson family in Krug's lot, dontcha think?) much like Tobe Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre – the only contemporary of this film. Last House caused incredible controversy, reaching fever pitch over here in the UK where it was banned by the brainless buffoons of the BBFC – it being one of the more high profile 'Video Nasties'. Despite the hysteria dying down over the years, the dark cloud of censorship (which still refuses to relent even as I write this in 2011!) hung over Last House on the Left for many years. The film did see release but with cuts until just recently when it was released fully uncut and uncensored (finally). It remains a cult classic of modern horror cinema and remains a sadistic, vile and primal piece of filmmaking. Hard to believe now that this was the debut feature of Craven, the darling of mainstream horror in the '90s with the Scream trilogy but I guess we all gotta start at the bottom. Joking aside, I hold a deep fascination with underground horrors of the '60s and '70s and Last House does more for me than any Hostel or Saw big budget, glossy, 'torture porn' movie ever will. Trivia note: the score in this film is performed by none other than Krug himself, David Hess. Bonus: The new 3 Disc Ultimate Edition DVD features the whole movie uncut and contains over five hours of special features including the documentary Going To Pieces: The Rise & Fall Of The Slasher Film which is really cool but has nothing to do with Last House on the Left!",The Last House on the Left

I have a great ability to wipe the figurative ""slate"" clean before watching any film, despite what i have read or seen. With this film, I had read all sorts of conflicting reviews. Some claim they could barely finish the film due to its graphic nature, some claim that while being over-hyped in that area, it is still a solid film that has historical significance in film-making. I understand the parallel that the director was attempting to draw between the light-hearted nature of television juxtaposed to the violent images on the news of Vietnam. All that aside, this movie is just plain awful and doesn't deliver on any level. The acting is roundly awful. Krugs gang is not frightening, intimidating or believable in any way. The movie plods along giving you a constant feeling that you are on the verge of seeing something shocking, but it never comes. They make one of their captors pee her pants, then they make them kiss, they rape them in a poorly done scene and then shoot one of them in a swamp. This is the first rape scene i have ever scene i have ever seen that didn't stir any emotion in me. The gang seems indifferent about everything they do. I don't mean indifferent in the ""Wow, these crazy bastards don't care 'bout nothing'!"" way, but more in the ""Do these actors know that the cameras are rolling right now?"" way. It's as if the whole film is a lighting rehearsal that was filmed and released. I'm baffled that this movie has achieved any status as an important or disturbing film. I'm a big fan of cult film and am still at a loss to see the interest in this film. I strongly suggest that you do not waste any of your precious time on this tripe.

293,Quincy-8,Recommended Highly,8,19 January 2002,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I saw this film years ago, when i lent a pirated copy off a friend of a friend. The quality of it was almost non exsistent, but the film struck a nerve with me. It was the most uncomfortable 90 minutes of my life.If you can get past the dodgy acting, and the ridiculous soundtrack, you find a horror film that could actually happen. The bad guys are not invincible, Unlike Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees, these people are flesh and blood, but they are evil. They have no particular problem with the two girls, and just do what they do for a cheap laugh.This film has been unfairly put into the exploitation category. It is not. It is a hard hitting crime film, which rightly carries a warning on the box. If you are easily offended don't watch it as the rape scenes are very disturbing, and when Mari is finally killed she just walks towards the lake with nowhere to go. It is very disturbing to watch as Mari seems to think, you're not going to torture me anymore, I either swim away or you shoot me and end my suffering.Do not compare this film to I Spit on your grave, which is just abysmal and pointless. It is an unearthed Jewell, while not everybody's taste, is a very good film.If you are interested in this, it has been announced it will be re-released in England very soon, although it will be heavilly cut, so I recommend you do what I did and get a copy from America (Sorry Mr Customs Man).",The Last House on the Left

From 'The hills have eyes' to 'Signs' and 'White noise' and nothing yet has managed to really chill me to the bone. Until now, this film is brilliant, it maintains typical Hollywood traits in a subtle way and yet presents scenes, that as an 18 year old girl, reflects my worst nightmare. Despite the fact that the film is rather poorly made and has some of the worst acting I've ever seen, it manages to present serial killers and cold blooded murderers in an unglamourous and truthful way. It has an element of humour that is laced in with the film in a way that makes people think 'What the hell am I watching?' but it somehow works to keep the audience watching and takes the edge off the seriousness of the film. The slapstick that purposefully or not seems like a send up of British humour in the 70s like the 'Carry on' films is another reason why this film is extremely out of the ordinary and different to any film I've ever seen. It even comes with a moral to the story! Don't do drugs! contradictory to the fun loving nature of the 70s! All in all this strange, almost forgotten film which was once banned in a few places for its stark and blunt approach to murder is brilliant. Wes Craven is fantastic, although this film seems like a failure at first, look past the terrible filming and the lack of SPFX and remember it was made in the 70s so be realistic in your expectations and enjoy it for what it is, a disturbing but playful 70s thriller flick!",The Last House on the Left

Furthermore the kidnappers somehow cross paths with one of the kidnapped girls parents and suffer ridiculous vigilante justice from the disgruntled parents.It's amazing that this film is even on DVD or VHS, or that Wes Craven ever got another movie contract!

Some of the actors may be better than others. Fortunatly, the villains are made up of the best actors in the movie, David Hess especially. David Hess made this movie feel brutally real and violent.The rape scenes in this movie may not be explicit, but everything is still as powerful as the violence of life. Last House on the Left is truly one of the most powerful exploitation film because it exploits the power of real life violence. This movie doesn't encourage violence towards women, it encourages the exact opposite.The movie also has a haunting soundtrack which can make you shed tears while watching the movie.

297,RIOTonSUNSET,"Disturbing for it's time, remains so today.",7,25 May 2003,"I can remember renting this film years ago (1998) with Nightmare/Elm ST. 3.  The movie, back then, was really just to waste the weekend for me.  I never really got into it.  Then I bought a used rental copy 2 years later, and after viewing it told myself that I would NEVER watch this movie again. I lied to myself.  Buying the uncut (More 'bout this later) movie just days ago, I felt like most others do after watching it...sick.  This movie is not pleasent.  The two girls that played the parts were amazing with what they had to do.  Last House is a lot to stomach, and both Wes and Sean do great with building sympathy for the girls.  No film has ever been done like this up to that point.  The Exorcist and Texas Chainsaw Massacre still had 2 years before they were viewed.  Now, to call this film uncut is just not true.the original film ran 91 minutes, and the latest edition runs at 84. The other 7 minutes were sliced by the projectionists at the drive-thrus. Although these 7 minutes are gone, and for people who would like to see the truly complete film, are out of luck.  Part of me is curious about what lied in those 7 minutes.  The other part is glad they were cut.  84 minutes is enough to get the point out there.  Anyways, this film is truly disturbing and should only be viewed by mature adults.  Basically Last House is too real for me, and it makes me aware of the problems that we are facing with nowadays, and to think it's gotten worse in 30 years really gets me concerned with where society is heading.  For being an eye-opener for that generation, and truly powerful, it's gets a 10.  For being watchable, 2.

Last House on the Left one-ups just about every other horror movie I've seen in regards to the depravity and intensity the scenes convey; however, what makes the film artful is the fact that there are no ""action shot"" (in other words, you see weapons, you see blood, you see nudity and in some instances you see the aftermath, but you're never shown the act itself) which is first an artistic choice and second an indication of the film's age, as special effects weren't prevalent in this era of film-making. Ultimately this is a film designed to elicit a visceral response from the audience and for those who are genuinely disturbed from viewing it might benefit by reciting the film's tag-line, which is, ""It's only a movie...it's only a movie...it's only a movie..."" The only gripe I have about the film is the sheriff and his deputy's incompetence interspersed throughout the film as a sort of ""comedic"" break, which puts the film in an even more bizarre context. Fan's of Rob Zombie may also notice that the title-card music for the film's trailer serves as the intro for the song ""Living Dead Girl"" which is ironic to say the least.",The Last House on the Left

301,erikbbergstrom,Amateur and Overrated,4,19 July 2011,"A reviewer here said that the Last House on the Left is a film that will either draw awe or ire depending on the viewer's sentiments towards shocking horror. I had neither. Viewing the movie for the first time as a 26-year-old male, I was able to see it in an objective light for what it really was -- an amateur trying his best to be one of his idols.Not to knock Craven too much for his attempt (we all want to mirror our idols some way or another), but this film isn't all that it's been cracked up to be over the past...almost 40 years now? There are no sympathetic characters, no sense of establishing mood or environment, no cohesive plot...just, as I said, an amateur trying to be an icon.While Wes Craven has now established himself as a ""Master of Horror"", his first film as a director isn't and shouldn't be marked as the highlight of his career. In fact, it would be sad if it truly was. He made many mistakes in this film, from the decisions on music (schlocky, distracting ballads to excruciating sing-along folk songs...sung by the main baddie 'Krug' himself!) to an ending that falls flat due to no proper build-up...although this may have been due to the lack of a decent budget in the first place.All in all, if you are like myself, 26 years old and still haven't seen this movie despite all the word of mouth and hype, I'd say skip it for better movies of that era. If you are younger, maybe just getting into the horror genre, I'd say give it a chance and form your own opinion...in fact, I'd say 99% of the film's apologists are those who saw it when they were 12 years old and found it to be very much unlike most of the cheesy slasher fare that they were used to. It's okay for what it is, basically a student film from a desperate director, but as far as an influential study of revenge and violence in horror, it's far from perfect or original.",The Last House on the Left

Is « The last house on the left » a disturbing film ? Yes, it is. BUT ! What makes it bad for a lot of people is, in my opinion, the music. The soundtrack is... well, bad ! It just doesn't fit at all with the pictures on screen. The movie as guts, it shows reel horror. It has an ambiance full of pain and the ending is just incredible. There's a rape scene, a suicide, guns, knifes, blood and murders. Everything in this movie is scary and shocking. The funny music ruins it all. During one scene, two cops are going after the bad guys, but the music in this scene makes it look like a scene from a comedy. It's not a good thing when you've just saw something really shocking happening 2 seconds earlier and then you see two cops acting like old actors from silent comedy of the 20's, it ruins the ambiance.To be honest, the movie is great. It's a horror classic for sure. One thing the remake as over the original is, again, the soundtrack. For me the remake is superior in the way that it's done (good acting, great ambiance) but fails with the ending though, the one in the original is way better. But anyway, what I wanted to say about this film, is that it has a great horror picture to offer, but (sadly) it covers it with a bad soundtrack. If music is not important for you, or like me you can (with some efforts) forget it when it's bad, you'll enjoy this film like I did.",The Last House on the Left

It was more violent than a lot of other movies, and even included a very, very mild rape scene. But over 30 years later, reading the reviews of it, hearing other people talking about it, you would get the impression that the movie is non-stop violence, non-stop tension, brutal, unrelenting aggression and rapes galore. You would think that it shows things that no other movie since then has shown. You would think that no other movie has come close to being as disturbing or intense as this. You'd be completely wrong. This movie, despite what anyone says, is not still as shocking and dirty and crazy and insane today as it was back then. Its intensity back then has inspired legions and legions of other, far more over the top movies.On the scale of disturbing and intense movies, with 1 being a Sesame Street movie and 10 being something that completely shocks me and gives me nightmares, Last House on the Left would get, maybe, a 4.It is labeled as a horror movie. Said by many to be one of, if not absolutely, Wes Craven's best. People have even gone so far as to say that it makes movies like Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, Halloween, and other movies look tame and like jokes. This couldn't be further from the truth. The horror elements of this movie take a back seat. It doesn't contain enough of anything that makes a good horror movie for me to call it horror at all. This is not horror. Slasher, maybe. Suspense, perhaps. Crime, indeed. A fake, sort of tamer version of a snuff film, sure. In horror you experience a sense of darkness and dread and uncertainty. This movie does not thrive on a successful portrayal of any of these emotions. With the constant cut scenes to the idiot, comic relief police officers, and the zany music, there is no time for suspense or fear to build. There is no appropriate setting for terror. No overwhelming sense of anything that a good horror movie creates is created. There are many movies out there that develop the same kind of tension that this movie builds, and they are not horror movies.The movie builds slight tension and leads to some short lived and not-so-shocking moments of violence and ""brutality"". This brutality is a stabbing similar to a stabbing seen in millions of other movies, and a rape that can hardly even be considered shocking considering that no actions are shown and the reactions are rather unbelievable. Oh, and then there's a shooting. Again, not something far out.The killer/rapist and his gang make their way to the house of the parents of one of the girls, where they ultimately meet their demise. I suppose that the methods of these people dying has also been mentioned as some of the ""over the top"" brutality. This is again, not the case. There is brutality, sure. But it is not shown visually, nor is it something that hasn't been shown in other movies. A man gets killed with a chainsaw, but you see nothing. A man gets his penis bitten (maybe bitten off?), which I suppose is the most brutal thing in the movie. But again, you see nothing. A movie can create all kinds of brutal and unimaginably crazy things if they will not even be shown on the screen. Considering this, there wasn't anything too extreme in this. If they're not going to show the actions, why not do something even crazier? You can get away with anything. If you're not limited by technology or props or even the actions, the only limit is the imagination. Taken like this, the acts are not so extreme at all.Even a ""remake"" 8 years later, by the name of House on the Edge of the Park, was far more shocking and intense than this and showed a lot more. It wasn't really a remake, but had the same premise and even starred David Hess in the exact same role, with a loser, idiot friend similar to Junior from this movie. It was a total rip-off/homage to Last House on the Left, and was light years ahead of it in terms of being shocking and over the top. But again, that wasn't a horror movie either. There's nothing terrifying about Last House on the Left, nor is there anything that can still be called remotely over the top, but it still remains a good movie that is watchable at any time. But it really does not deserve to be called the many things it's been called. But watch it for its plot and characters and the events that unfold, taking them as they are. Taken as it is, it's an above average movie.",The Last House on the Left
306,giallanza,Changed my mind on this one,7,19 December 2005,"During its first run in the early 70s this was the only movie I ever walked out on (until Alien vs. Predator last year), and the only one I rated 1 out of 10. However, I watched it recently and I've changed my mind. Certainly there have been many more explicitly violent films in the 30 odd years since Last House on the Left debuted, but this movie still stands up for pure psychological impact. Despite the sometimes over the top banter among the criminals it still has a kind of realism that makes its ""its only a movie"" tag line particularly appropriate. This is not a great film (and it is still uncomfortable viewing), but it is a good film. Unless you're a sociopath yourself you won't enjoy the violence any more than the violence in the opening of ""Saving Private Ryan"", but you won't forget it. I never did.Wes Craven has nothing to be ashamed of here.I give it 7 of out 10.",The Last House on the Left
307,atmosphere21,HIGHLY HIGHLY OVERRATED!!!!,2,24 June 2001,I rented this movie for the first time about a year ago and must say that I was heavily heavily disappointed.  I had been lead to believe for all these years that this is one of the scariest movies of all time.  Maybe you had to see it when it was initially released to appreciate the movie.  I just wasn't impressed.  To me the scariest aspect of the movie was the acting. It was pretty sad.  Take it from a true horror fanatic....Stay away from this movie.,The Last House on the Left
308,tem164,darkest humor,4,24 January 2002,"LHotL is one of the more disturbing movies I've seen and contains some very, very dark humor.  At the same time that the young girls are getting raped, tortured, beaten, and shot, the stereotypical bumbling sheriff and his young deputy, who are attempting to arrive to find the psychotics who have broken out of prison, fall into a series of misadventures, including one with a freakishly gap-toothed black woman talking about chickens and how she can't carry the civil officers.Huh?Exactly what I was thinking.  This movie contains some other strange sequences that were obviously intended for comic relief, but basically end up completely destroying some facets of the plot. Odd music is heard when Krug has sex with Sadie in the back seat of the convertible, almost a theme-song for the young, excessively violent and maniacal attackers.  Sadie talks about ""Sigmund Frood"".The evil characters themselves are somewhat interesting when actually portrayed, but it was as though their parts were stereotypically written as tremendously evil.  Krug was in jail for killing ""a priest and two nuns"" and his son got hooked on heroin from good ol' Pops.A particularly bizarre moment is when the parents discover their child's body and you can clearly see her eyes open, and she even moves around a little bit.But the greatest part is of course, what happens to poor Weasel.4/10",The Last House on the Left

I have to say I enjoyed it very much, having seen almost every horror film ever made, this one stood out. It is raw and gritty and makes you cringe. The part that makes it the scariest is how real it is! Movies like Friday the 13th can't freak you that much because real people cannot keep coming back to get you!
The plot of this movie, if there is a plot, two girls get picked up by 3/4 escaped convicts, and the rest of the movie is basically them trying to get away, and being down right tortured. The twisted ending is reason enough to watch this film.",The Last House on the Left
311,eyeball2055-250-531978,Great Horror for IT'S TIME... but the Music Score was Terrible!,5,15 December 2018,"I just watched this again after nearly 40 years... having seen and enjoyed the remake immensely. I wanted my 18 year-old Grandson to see it as we watch many Movies of different types often. I was a Projectionist at a Drive-in and two walk-in Theaters between 16-18 years old and I Showed this and thought it was one of the most disturbing Murder-Horror type films I had ever seen. After watching it again I can say it was great for it's time but whoever thought the Music score added to this was appropriate had to be Mental themselves!It was a shocking Movie in those days because the World was a smaller place... no internet, no cellphones... no video games... no actual input about the 'Real' World except what we were told by the two or three News sources we had. CGI did not exist... only creative technicians who figured out how to mix things to look like Blood, internal organs and other gross effects.The special effects for this Movie were cheap but effective if the goal was to make the audience's stomachs queasy...then. The acting was mediocre at best and terrible at times... but then... that was all we had to judge by those days when it came to horror. The TRUE 'shock Value in this film was NOT the Special effects, idiotic Music that distracted from any serious viewing... but the cold... callous... vicious acts these Criminals perpetrated on Two Innocent Teens. Sadly these types of acts are still among us every day in REAL Life.
The Reaction of the one Teen's Parents was expected but very badly portrayed with the exception of the 'Mom's Revenge' by the Pond... Cringeworthy for sure! Dad's fight with the Main Villain was tedious at best although with at least satisfying results!The Two Bumbling Policemen parts were just ridiculous and could easily have been eliminated to at least TRY to maintain a serious theme... but again... the Music ruined that altogether by itself. Maybe turn the sound off and use the subtitles!?Is it worth watching?... yes... if you have some free time and take into account the limitations of those days... Keep your expectations low and the Popcorn Bowl filled and you may get some enjoyment !But the Remake is MUCH more what I expected from this first!",The Last House on the Left
312,mansour8687,Not as Disturbing by 2007's standards....,5,8 November 2007,"Last House on the Left by Wes Craven was not disturbing by modern standards,although it must have been in 1972. Too many wars and mass murders have happened, in fact too many horror movies, have desensitized me to the cheap special effects employed in this film. Granted that the death scenes for the two main characters are beautifully acted and convincingly portrayed; the felon crew are hedonistic and ephemeral, darker versions of the lost boys who feel empowered and gratified by the power evil itself can bestow on its followers. Or for that matter,the madness that clouds the mind when we indulge our fantasies, however vile and wicked, and become addicted to the pursuit of our own pleasure at the expense of our fellow humans. More shocking is the methodical revenge planned by Mari's parents, including the infamous genitalia mutilation scene in which one felon member is attacked in retaliation for Mari's murder. The actions of Mari's parents remind us that the greatest temptation of evil lies in avenging the wrongs that have been done with us, and losing ourselves as it were, to the Devil's ultimate temptation: an eye for an eye, one evil in return for another.While the movie's greatest strength lies in its frank portrayal of the thin line between innocence and experience, between sexual liberty and psychotic hedonistic fantasy, it has been far outclassed by films such as High Tension, Funny Games, and Hostel II. It seems Hollywood plays up on the brutalization of girls and women by psychotic men (and psychotic women) and one wonders if this is, in some way, encouraging the Ted Bundys of the world. I've seen more blood and guts in Dario Argento's Suspiria and The Card Player. Perhaps in 1972 this was a shocker, but not so today. Hostel II is ripe with women's victimization; one girl is mutilated with a chainsaw, another hung upside down and carved into pieces. I've come to see the murderers in Last House as a group of fallen lost boys, who choose to empower themselves by doing evil and become lost in the dark hedonistic obsessions they indulge in. Instead of offering innocent pleasure, fraternity and happiness, they inflict misery and anguish and deify themselves as the masters of life and death who can inflict rape and murder at a whim. The felon crew is an example suggesting that the road to evil begins when one isolates oneself from human morality. They contrast with the emerging sexuality of the young girls, who while no longer innocent children, remain untainted by evil's embrace. We were always preoccupied with our Dark side and the implications of a fall from grace, not only in a Judeo-Christian sense, but in an evolutionary one. A primitive band of humans, who could not be expected to understand murder and the implications of evil, evolved into an allegedly civilized race, the difference being we left the good old cave and traded it for Manhattan or at one time, Ancient Rome. I think Nathaniel Hawthorne's ""Young Goodman Brown"" is a prime example of this. Primitive humans did unspeakable things, like cannibalism and human sacrifice, for both ritual needs and, at times, personal gratification. Joseph Conrad, in Heart of Darkness, suggested that the primitive man can be forgiven his crimes because he is primitive and does not 'know better'. For the early man, morality does not exist. Surely he came to know the horror of his deeds, but primitive man could not be expected to realize that evil is not the true nature of the world.I think we sometimes forget that horror is a mirror, a simulation of our darker selves and the forces that drive us to bond with our Shadow. It shows that for all our vaunted goodness and civility, we still function on that primitive social level. The difference being we are expected to know better because we ought to have a better understanding of morality and compassion. This movie, Last House on the Left, like any other horror, reminds us of our Shadow's presence and that it cannot be ignored or fully understood. He dwells inside each one of us.On the other hand, horror can still be great fun. It can make us laugh at our own frailty, or shock us at our own cruelties. It is a great moneymaker. However, it is still powerful and disturbing material. What is has to present is not easily digested, hence not particularly ""user friendly"". Horror is great when you have a clear conscience and a talent or ability to know instinctively that is only a simulation of a false reality. If you can't do that, you'd best find another entertainment.",The Last House on the Left

I had no idea what I was in for. The plot is simple, shot like a Docu-drama, but holy hell, this thing requires 3 showers afterword and you'll still feel dirty! Nasty, nasty degradation, some vile, ruthless thugs, virginal Mari, tough Phyllis, ""I live right there!"" Sick, sick, sick. I don't want to rehash the movie (I hate when people do that)but this makes ""I Spit on your Grave"", ""Texas Chainsaw"" & ""Halloween"" (horribly overrated movie) all look like 90210.

By the various comments I have seen on the message boards, I must say I was expecting something quite powerful. To my surprise, it just happened,in my opinion,to be one of the most crappy and awful movie I have ever seen. I'm sorry but I actually didn't find ANYTHING good about this movie.The acting was horrible, the music was simply purely irritating and the plot was actually very, very weak I thought. I mean, yes, it's maybe disturbing, but it would have been incredibly much more disturbing and scary if the actors weren't actually so freaking bad.The basic plot was maybe interesting at the beginning but it turned out that the characters were so under-developed that I just truly didn't care anymore about them in the end. I'm sorry to say that but this movie was, for me, only pure exploitative crap. It's disgusting but for absolutely nothing. For those of you who want to see true and genuine horror movies, I would suggest the remakes of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or ""Amytiville Horror"" any day instead of this truly disappointing movie.

Last House on the Left, however is in a class of its own, nothing before or since can compare to the surreal nature of this film. I can't imagine how it ever made it to the screen, and even now I have a hard time dealing with the memories of the scenes that were presented.

In scenes that were supposed to be intense, like the runaway part they put songs that seemed to have been taken out of a cartoon or a cowboy movie or something. Even the rape scene, which in the new one is one of the most intense scenes, did absolutely nothing for me on this one.

320,milesihamerimdb,It's Barely a Movie,3,5 October 2006,"This is a shocking film on many levels. Yes, there's the violence, the sadism and the indifference with which the majority of the 'action' is shot. But it's also shocking for its sheer ineptitude by a director who would improve considerably for his later releases (Hills Have Eyes, A Nightmare on Elm Street & Scream most notably).The amateur performances by the leads -David Hess' Krug a notable exception- to the intrusive folk jangles of Hess' strumming jar uncomfortably with the broad comedy pairing of the cops in pursuit. The heroine victims manage to elicit the sympathy deserved of such characters in their situation  something of a miracle given the sub-standard acting involved.The unpleasant casual nature of the torture inflicted is perhaps where the film becomes less than bearable and it was at this point I began to wonder quite why I had been so keen to view it. Certainly on a film such as the superlative Texas Chainsaw Massacre there is satisfaction beyond the torture; there is an expert behind the camera and tension raised in sympathy for the lead. Last House has a camera clumsily pointed at violence for its own sake. Even bitterer is the pill to swallow that the film-makers were less than generous to the cast members playing the victims. Apparently the girl playing Mari was deliberately frightened on set by her fellow actors.A remake of a Bergman it may be but this film has no truck with art.

I was not going to comment on this movie, but after reading so many favorable reviews from other viewers on this site, I had to set the record straight. This movie is terrible! I mean this movie is bad! It does not deserve some hallowed place in the horror movie hall of fame. It deserves to sit on your local video store shelf, collecting dust. The tagline for this movie says to keep repeating, ""it's only a movie, it's only a movie.."" well guess what? It's not. It is just a big mess.

According to one song in the movie, the road leads to nowhere. Apparently, so does this movie. People like to say this movie paved the way for such classics as Halloween. I say that is ridiculous. Halloween used lighting, camera angles, music and story to create suspense and action. Last House on the Left misuses these same things to create NOTHING!!! A friend of mine and I usually rent two or more horror movies per week, in search of truly bad movies. We are working on a book rating all the horror movies we can get our hands on. As a result of this, we have found many movies that are bad, but some are still entertaining. Unfortunately, Last House on the Left is on par with such uninteresting drivel as The Howling: New Moon Rising, perhaps the worst movie ever made, regardless of genre. Wes Craven is a wildly erratic filmmaker who got lucky with Nightmare on Elm Street and the Scream movies.

It was an okay flick. 2 girls get raped and murdered, big deal. It wasn't even that graphic and I got the UNCUT version. This movie does not even compare to Halloween, The Changeling and Texas Chainsaw massacre (which I thought was much more disturbing than LHOTL). Plus the revenge scene at the end was just totally unrealistic. I am not saying it was a bad movie.

I watched it a few more times over several months and started to appreciate the film for some storyline and plot elements.Later I acquired a US unrated release - stating that it was 3 minutes longer, I watched and saw no difference, being very curious, I setup 2 videos and played the film side by side.  I soon realised it was frame rates that made the 3 minute difference, but also notice something else, some of the scenes were edited differently and hence had a different impact - the one I noticed most was the scene where Mari is raped and Krug cuts his name on her neck - in the Dutch release, this is one long scene, but in the US release this scene is split in two with the scene of the blundering policemen - making the US version seem a lot less harsh and nasty than the Dutch.Later I bought a comprehensive book on the film, read it cover to cover, then watched the film again, with all this new information in my head, I enjoyed the film much much more, so now it's one of my favourites.Krug scares the hell out of me though.",The Last House on the Left

How many movies did you see back then where a guy gets his penis bit off while being blindfolded with his tie? Answer: None. It was a low budget movie absolutely, but it was definitely pushing the envelope as you just didn't see this stuff in a movie back then. Movies that are rated R now were rated X back then.

How ANYONE could be haunted by this movie, (other than by the fact that Wes Craven ever got to make another film after this garbage) is completely beyond me. His later films have much more graphic violence than this movie.

I agree with some of the other comments that it's right up there with the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre in the way it messes with your mind.Now, I know that many horror movies have flimsy plot lines/stories, and that's part of the fun, but I really think Craven missed a chance to make this movie a truly great horror classic. If just a few things were done differently I think it would have made a big difference... The biggest example is the decision made by the parents to exact revenge on their daughter's murderers. How did these square, conservative country folks suddenly morph into torturers in their own right? The father setting up Home Alone-style traps for the killers around the home? The mother giving oral sex to her daughter's murderer, only to bite off the guy's you-know-what? I think there should have been a scene in which the parents sit and decide what to do, possibly even after hearing from Mari about all the disgusting torture that the killers inflicted upon her (apparently it was Craven's original plan to keep her alive long enough to do so). This would have explained the parents' motivation to not only kill, but also torture the convicts... At least a scene where they show that a switch has been flipped in the parents' minds which allows them to suddenly become the killers themselves. I'm picturing a breakfast scene taking place after the parents have been up all night plotting and becoming more and more crazily distraught, while the killers still have no idea they're onto them...",The Last House on the Left

It brought back terrible memories of the time I saw it. Two male friends and I were looking for something to do when we were in high school - and ended up just going to the local drive in theater. We didn't know or care what was playing. It just happened to be Last House on the Left. I sat in the front seat in between my two male friends. The movie was watch-able at first. We laughed at the poor acting and storyline. We had no idea what we had in store for use. The final 45 minutes was one of the most sadistic and de-humanizing movie I have ever seen. Even the two high school senior boys on either side on me groaned in horror and psychic disturbance. I have no idea why people like Wes Craven has a need to use the film medium to act out their own sadistic tendencies - leaving lasting nausea and nightmare=producing images with their viewers.

347,ZenChild,A few diamonds in the rough,7,27 August 2003,"It is hard to imagine now quite how shocking this film would have been on it's release,  although by modern standards it is (in my opinion) now relatively tame.On the whole I thought the film was OK, if heavily flawed, but even so it is a remarkable first film for Wes Craven.There are many reviews which provide a synopsis of the file, so I do not feel the need to go over old ground. However,  anyone who says this is a poor or perverse film must have been watching a different film to me.
Although gratuitous and disturbing I did not feel that any of the scenes eroticised the treatment of the two victims, and I felt the degradation actually made me feel like a grubby voyeur placing the viewer in the helpless position of Jnr.In amongst the many poorly handled scenes there are a few striking moments that for me are some of the best in any film I have seen. The often cited `Hammer and Chisel' scene made me squirm in my seat, and my favourite scene was immediately after Mari's rape as we see the reaction of the gang to their acts of violence.Is this a great film, No, does it contain moments of greatness, yes indeed. This is a better film than I had expected, and although I can see why many people (including fans of extreme cinema) would not enjoy it.

The characters are great, the music is at some point appropriate, but over all it has no jumps or bumps or any quality that so ever that is scary. I know a lot of people on here will use the age factor to diminish my opinions. BUT it is no ten star movie. I gave it a five out of ten because it is a classic and I loved the scene when the villains stop and think about what they have done. You can almost see that they actually feel sorry for what they did. That was what made the movie.It is a must see for people like me that are movie enthusiasts, but don't expect to be scared.

352,mikehammer-1,"Not as good as some say, not as bad as many say",7,3 May 2004,"Spoilers!! ""Last House On The Left"" is best described as inconsistent. The movie is based on an incredibly ambitious and intellectual idea (which is quite amazing if you consider the background of it) but it can't quite deliver on that promise. I think in many ways it has more in common with psychological drama than horror movies and if I had to think of a movie ""The Last House On The Left"" reminds me of I have to say Clockwork Orange comes up in my mind, not ""Nightmare On Elm Street"" or other famous horror movies. Alex and his gang never got up to acts of violence quite as depraved as those acted out by Krug and his gang but both gangs share this anarchic sense of vicious brutality for the sake of it. Of course TLHOTL is not nearly as good a movie as the Clockwork Orange, in fact, TLHOTL is a rather badly crafted movie. But nevertheless both are pieces of the very specific ""Zeitgeist"" of the early 70s.The movie is not nearly as good as it could or maybe even should be though. Mainly because it is, as said at the beginning, quite inconsistent.The movie can be easily divided into three sections, the beginning which sets up the events to follow by displaying the ""peaceful suburban lives"" of the victims and also the crude existences of Krug and his gang. The beginning is unfortunately marred by bad editing and a bad script which leads to two things: 1) you dont really get to know the girls and the family of Mari well enough to really create conventional drama in the rest of the movie 2)it actually does help in setting up the criminals to be quite weird oddballs which is in my view helping the realism of the movie's middle part quite a bit.The middle part is the strong point of the movie and it's here where the movie earns its accolades. This middle part begins with the two girls falling into the hands of the Krug gang in New York City and depicts the humiliation, psychological and physical torture, raping and eventual killing and mutilating of the girls in woods which are located near the house of one of the victims. This part is quite disturbing to watch as it lets you take a rather good peek into the abyss of human cruelty. Even the often maligned score can be creepily effective here as the soft sound of an acoustic guitar accompanies scenes of human tragedy. I have to say this part is by far the most chilling depiction of sex crimes I have seen yet in movies.The thugs arent in any way depicted as special, clever, tough or crafty, they are shown as lowlife failures, clumsy and simple, their viciousness shown only by their actions not their pose. The movie spends quite a lot of time with them, the focus is as much on them as it is on the victims which gives us a sense of disgusting intimacy with the killers. The movie offers us no real motivation for the acts of the killers, their crimes are commited for no specific reason or rather reasons deeply embedded in their disturbed psyches  which arent shared with the viewers. This look on the killers is more realistic and more disturbing than the super killers we usually are confronted with in horror movies and thrillers. The victims are portrayed fairly well too. Phylis is the ""rough girl"" of the two and consequently follows one path possible to victims of such a crime - defiance and resistance. Mari, the daughter of our avengers-to-be, is the ""soft innocent girl"" and generally acts more submissively and mostly pleads to the criminals. The victims arent particularly smart or strong, they arent depicted as overly weak or stupid either, they just act as one could reasonably expect normal girls to act in such a terrible situation. The suffering of the victims is depicted as intimately and harshly as the behavior of the killer. Everything here feels very immediate and I think it's that and the realism provided by the banal way in which both killers and victims are portrayed what makes this part so disturbing to watch. Dont expect cinematography at its best here either though, it's a sloppily made movie throughout and while interestingly and possibly unintentionally it adds a lot to this part, it also subtracts a lot from the movie as a whole.The end depicts the gang of killers ending up at the home of Mari's parents who unsuspectingly let them in thinking they are salespeople. The parents discover what happened to their daughter and her friend and extract revenge on the killers and kill them in grotesque fashion (one gang member has his penis bitten off by the mother of the victim, Krug is killed by the father with a chainsaw, the female gang member's throat is slit by the mother,the demented junior member of the gang is forced to commit suicide by Krug in a rather bizarre twist). Being the ending this obviously is a core of the supposed message of the movie but one has to admit that it's butchered by a horrible script and it has to be said that this movie would probably make a better impression if it ended once Mari has been killed. The actions of the parents and their motivations are badly explained and generally the movie is just going through the motions here to get to an end, there is little drama, little psychology and, as a total contrast to the middle part, very little intimacy in this part. This is a part of the movie where a better script could've worked wonders and you can see that Craven didnt really think of it as a potential masterpiece or even a proper drama at any point (or else he would have given this part more attention when writing the script). This ending however is at least honest to its intentions as it does not glorify these revenge killings in any way, the viewer is not inclined at all to cheer for the parents on their revenge killing spree. However it also totally fails in depicting the process of law-abiding good-natured citizens turning into brutal killers which is somewhat essential to make the story work.Before I come to a conclusion I may add that there are parts throughout this movie which show two bumbling cops blundering their way through the countryside. These parts are embarrassingly trying to be funny and it's incredibly difficult to see why they are in this movie at all. I do think the idea of depicting incompetent cops does have a potential role in the story. When cops are shown to be idiots then one layer of our traditional sense of security is removed, we realize that law and order are not factors we can count on in this scenario. However these cops here are portrayed in such a corny over the top way, one feels reminded of bad British slapstick comedy of the 60s which removes any sort of serious purpose these scenes could have and since they arent funny they dont work as ""comic relief"" either.I shall conclude that ""The Last House On The Left"" supposedly tells us a story about the futility of violence and how violence itself has a dehumanizing effect on those who exert it. But I have to say that it fails in bringing that point across consistently and that's probably why you have to say the movie falls short of its ambitions. Much of the movie is incredibly corny, there is bad acting and a bad script. As a low-budget movie it's not overly well shot either. One has to say that as a ""rape revenge"" drama it is a failure as the revenge part is just bad. It works much better as a rape drama and indeed it is the disturbingly realistic depiction of the victims' humiliating ordeal starting with their apprehension in NYC and their brutal deaths in those woods which redeems this movie. It's a harsh and blunt look at the human abyss and as such it is not only disturbing but also valuable to those fascinated by human depravation (and I suppose judging by the popularity of books, shows and movies relating to serial killers and other psychopaths that basically means all of us).",The Last House on the Left

354,tony_flyboy,Wes Craven's seminal classic *Contains Spoilers*,10,4 September 2004,"On the 2nd of October 1971, Westport Connecticut. Wes Craven began filming a low- budget shocker with producer Sean S Cunningham under the title ""Night of Vengeance"". That film became the cult horror classic The Last House On The Left. Last House tells the gritty story of two teenage girls who head into New York City to see a band called ""Blood Lust""; they make a quick stop to try and score Grass. Things don't go to plan, they end up being abducted, raped and killed by a family of fugitive killers. This film certainly isn't for everyone! Fans of Wes Craven's mainstream work such as A Nightmare on Elm Street and The Scream movies might want to stay clear unless you're up for this! There are many different views on this film. Some see a modern classic. (Me) Others see cruel exploitation and some even see a dated cheese movie.The films strongest moments take place during the scenes in the woods, Where the two girls Mari and Phyllis are forced to strip and ""make it with each other"" at knife point by Krug, Weasel and Sadie. It's quite horrible to watch the first time. The rape and murders are mostly one shot, hand held and very gritty. If you don't already know the story then you'll be in for a shock because the film doesn't end there. The killers disgusted by their actions seek refuge in a near by house which turns out to be the house of the rape victim Mari! The parents discover what has happened to their daughter and want revenge. The killers meet a violent death. Death by Chain saw, fellatio castration! - One hell of a Freudian Nightmare! & not forgetting suicide. It's not exactly the Christmas family movie. But to Fans of true cult horror it's Citizen Kane! Just for the record this is one of my favorite films! Along with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Dawn of the Dead, Night of The living Dead, The Evil Dead, Suspiria, Blue Velvet, Martin, The Hills Have Eyes and many more! One other thing to note is that this movie has been cut banned in just about every country in the world. Its original running time was 92mins. The longest version now is about 84mins. This is due to the fact that cinemas, local councils, the censors, the producer etc have cut the prints so many damn times! I actually own the UK anchor bay DVD. A special 2disc set full of extras. OK it has 31seconds deleted from it but even the BBFC can't destroy the power of this picture. The US version is longer but the UK has more extras. One other thing to note he UK has an Easter egg which gives you a link to view the bbfc cuts & and stills of the cuts. So there you have. The movie came out of a time of repression, War, Student Riots and censorship. Very few directors were brave enough to challenge the politics of the time. George Romero with Night of The Living Dead, Tobe Hooper with Texas Chainsaw and finally Craven with Last House. These Films are a big F**k you to right- wing middle class values!

Not to pick on these movies,they have their place, but ""Last House on The Left"" is not your typical horror movie. It is more disturbing than 'jump out of your seat scary'. To reap the full impact of this movie you should place yourself in the position of the two girls. You couldn't tell by looking at them that the creeps in this movie are capable of what they did. Unlike most horror movies, this is something that could probably happen, and similar things have happened maybe not moment for moment or action for action but they have. Young girls, women, and even children, have been abducted, raped and murdered unfortunately. Furthermore, I bet their parents or other family members would love to have the opportunity of revenge. Perhaps, the subject matter may even be a little too realistic and intense for some viewers.Rather than hiding under the blankets, or jumping at every single noise like other movies, after this movie, I felt like crying. The girls seemed so ordinary like they could have been almost any teenage girls. There were things that I didn't like about the movie, such as, the soundtrack was very corny at points, and the camera work left something to be desired. However, I do not think that this movie should be just tossed aside for being 'not scary', so, not a worthwhile horror movie.

I hate this movie. I loathe this movie. I wish it had not been made. After I saw it, I puked. ------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------",The Last House on the Left
360,ThomasKrome,Masterpiece !,10,13 February 2005,"As I had seen Tlhotl. the first time, I was confused and not sure what to think about the movie. On the one hand, it seemed to be a stupid movie that enjoys violence, but on the other hand there was somehow more about it. After a week, I watched it the second time, and I slowly began to realize the genius that's behind this work. It's a low-budget movie, which tops every 50-million dollar thriller/horror-movie that exists in the way of directing, screening, acting and how it really touches the viewer, also by the sarcastic trick of putting the horrible events in contrast to a lovable, sweet blues/country-soundtrack made by genius David Hess. One argument, so many people hate the movie is its extremely realistic violence (mentally and physically) but thats kind of a weird double morality, as the movie makes quite experience-able, what violence means, and what crimes do to families. I think in a radical way, the film must be seen as a statement against violence, quite longsighted for the time it was made as nowadays we have come to a culture, in which violence and crimes, tragedy's of humans are pure consumable entertainment, a trend which (as so often bad trends do) started up in the U.S.A. and came over to Europe the last years (reality serials that ""entertain"" by endlessly presenting homicides and sexual crimes, using the victims families in a voyeuristic way). This trend is disgusting, and not The last house on the left !!! Thanks to Wes Craven, and his encouraged, extremely talented cast (one name: David Hess, a man that with better luck could have played the same roles like Robert De Niro) with L.h.o.t.l. the so called horror-genre (I wouldn't call it a horror movie, but its seen as one) has become one of its really view masterpieces. Its in a way pure irony, that this ""worst movie of all times"" can only be completely understood by consumers with a high intellect, a gore freak that doesn't want to think will probably not like it. Anyway, anyone who got strong nerves and is willing to understand this movie, should really see it, as its one of the most worth-full movies ever made !!",The Last House on the Left
361,artsmyth,Still Shocking After All These Years,6,14 February 2005,"Another reviewer (see Dan Grant, below) has already vividly described the effect of seeing this film for the first time. There is no doubt that Last House on the Left is one of the most affecting films I have ever seen. However, integrity demands I shave off a number of points simply because the film doesn't entirely overcome the obstacles presented by a very low budget and a callow director.I saw this exploitation flick while working the graveyard shift in a home for retarded adults. I'm not sure why I watched it all the way through since splatter movies are not my cup of tea -- maybe I was ready for a change from late-80s MTV or maybe something in the film itself held me, but for most of the time I was watching it, I was thinking: this is the worst film I've ever seen (hadn't yet seen Plan 9).Then, when the action came to its climax it hit me that this movie is actually a re-make of one of Ingmar Bergman's black-and white religious films. I was stunned! I found it hard to believe Craven had even seen any film before, let alone based one on a work by perhaps the greatest master of world cinema.But Last House stayed with me. Not a year goes by that some unbidden image doesn't pop into my head while I'm driving or trying to fall asleep. Wes Craven, despite having made this movie with little money and less experience, hit on some awful truth that for the longest time was nameless for me.Now, of course, I realize that the truth is simply one of Evil, American style. While Bergman spent perhaps three minutes total screen time on the violence in his narrative, with the rest of the movie involving the characters' inner landscapes, Craven spends MOST of the film on acts of violence (both physical and psychical, to quote Bergman) using them as windows into his characters' interiors.And the evil we see, especially that of the film's sociopaths, is pure.Yes, we know there are folks out there without a shred of mercy, who would do to us or our children the things done in the film, just for a lark. We read about them in the newspaper. But knowing something and seeing exactly what it would look like are two different things entirely.That is why I was wrong at first about this movie. More than any other film I've seen, this one brought home to me the vulnerability of my all-too-human flesh and civilized thought-patterns. I (and probably you) would be no match for the life-sized evil encountered in this film -- evil that's so much easier to believe in than the over-blown monsters Craven served up to us later.If you like horror flicks, don't miss this one. If you don't, check out the Bergman inspiration (look it up -- I promised no spoilers). Either way, you'll be hit with a truth you need to know about.",The Last House on the Left
362,annamae3,Disturbing. . .but is it horror?,9,19 August 2005,"An early effort from future horror-meisters Wes Craven (A Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream) and Sean Cunningham (Friday the 13th), The Last House on the Left is a disturbing, unsettling, and gritty film. Taking its cues from Bergman's The Virgin Spring, Craven's film tells the tale of two young girls on their way to a concert. On the way back, they try to ""score some pot"" from a young man. He takes them to his apartment, which doubles as the hangout for his father's gang (more on that in a moment). The rest of the plot is incidental, and everyone is more or less familiar with it. We all know the ending of the film, as well--the parents of one of the young girls discover that the travelers they are playing host to are the same people who brutalized their daughter, so they exact their equally brutal revenge.What matters here is not the story, nor the gore, nor the sorry excuse for comic relief (a pair of bumbling cops); nor is it the hokey music (composed by David Hess, who plays the gang's leader Krug) and terrible dialogue. It's the subtext: the horrors of Vietnam, of Kent State, of the napalm attacks at My Lai--they are all played and replayed out before our eyes. It's the thought of people suddenly and almost inexplicably snapping, their mental facilities broken by some tragedy.It's the feeling that this could happen to you. Or me.If this is a horror film, it's nothing like the horror films we're used to. There is no masked boogeyman with a knife. There is no supernatural element to haunt us. There is only us. Humans. People with emotions who make rash decisions and either regret them, or have second thoughts about them (as the gang seem to do in this film more than once), or try to get out of the situations based on their decisions. It's a heartless film. It's hard to watch. It's painful and gruesome and pretty damn awful.Is it a true horror film? You decide.",The Last House on the Left
363,silenthill3isgod-1,Interesting yet very disturbing,6,18 April 2005,"Alright, I don't know if it's just because I am a teenager in todays time, but i saw this movie the other night and I have many things to say on this. First of all, it's creepy. I liked that it was very strange, but it was still creepy. The scenes of rape and killing almost looked real and sent shivers down my spine. It was good acting, but in some parts you wonder about it because people in the movie act like they are just trying to remember their lines. I wouldn't want to watch it again, but I would recommend it for people who haven't seen it. It's one of those movies that you should see in your lifetime. But, only if you have the stomach for it because the blood does look very real in the film.",The Last House on the Left
364,thanosk_doc,Cheap-made cult non-horror movie,2,5 January 2019,"I usually avoid watching movies with score below 5/10. This one was at 6/10, I said why not? I scrolled through the user reviews declaring this film as a ""classic disturbing horror"" one. I was totally fooled. All the bad things that can exist on a movie can be found here: horrible actors (the two cops that make the Dumb and Dumber seem like geniuses? the father? the junkie son? the grey-haired villain? the girl Mari?), terrible music that makes you feel like watching a parody, bad spoken lines, bad photography, bad built plot (story is based on true incidents but there was zero creativity to make all this feel like a film story). All bad, bad, bad. Last but not least,it was no disturbing at all (horror-ish is out of the question by miles). The music and acting and all amateurish things make you rarely laugh and mostly bore you to death.",The Last House on the Left
365,dantc-1,A movie you wont forget,8,18 March 2006,"If I had to describe this movie in one word it would be ""Disturbing"". THIS IS NOT A ""FEEL GOOD"" MOVIE.I saw it when it came out in theatre's with my mother and sister. I was nine and my sister was fourteen. I suspect my mother was hoping to instill a healthy caution of strangers in us by teaching us what evil some people are capable of. If so, it worked.It's a unique movie (especially for it's day) in that the story takes you step by sickening step from the abduction of a minor(s) for sexual pleasures through murdering the victim(s). The graphics were every bit as telling as the story line was.Unfortunateley it's not a unique subject in reality but hearing these stories on the news when they happen don't reveal the horrer some of the victims endure whereas the movie brings you as close to the victims perspective as you'd care to get, maybe closer. The movie does deal some payback to the ""Bad Guys"" towards the end but hardly enough to make you get up and cheer after what you've seen to that point.I think it's a bit over the top as a life lesson for a child because while it would persuade a child to excersize caution, it also gives you a general bad feeling about people and what life could deal to anyone at random.One thing's for certain, you'll never forget it. For good or bad it leaves quite the lasting impression.I've never heard mention of it as playing on T.V., cable or otherwise. I thought maybe it was banned from the U.S. for it's intense content but I find no mention of that on the internet. I wonder why it fell into obscurity like it did.",The Last House on the Left
366,marlashu,It was on my bucket list,7,29 August 2018,"This film has been on my horror bucket list for years and I finally sat down to watch it. Intentionally funnier than expected, not really a horror movie. More of a sick, twisted and sad story, but I can see how it paved the way for the slasher film.",The Last House on the Left
