0,TheLittleSongbird,Lacklsutre but it does have its decent assets,5,25 September 2010,"PROS: The cinematography is beautiful, and the special effects are above average. The score is still rousing, and Christopher Reeve is likable enough as Superman. The film is decently paced and there are one or neat touches such as when Superman turns nasty.CONS: The storytelling is very clunky for me, while the script is awful. Margot Kidder apparently wanted little to do with this film and if true I'm afraid it does show, while Robert Vaughan is a pretty poor replacement for Gene Hackman and the less said about Pamela Stephenson the better. Also the direction is rather heartless and using Richard Pryor as the source of the laughs just didn't work.Overall, it is disappointing and lacklustre but it is watchable unlike the fourth. Anyway that is another story. 5/10 Bethany Cox",Superman III
1,Leofwine_draca,Drivel,2,11 March 2011,"I'd heard this film was bad, but ye gods! I had no idea it would be this awful. Turning the whole epic superhero movie into a silly, superficial comedy was definitely a big mistake, and you know this is going to be a chore to sit through right from the diabolical opening sequence (which seems to go on forever). An embarrassed-looking Robert Vaughn takes over chief villain duties as a rich businessman who harnesses the power of computer technology to rule the world (and kill Superman at the same time). Much of the focus is on Richard Pryor as a supposedly amusing computer programmer but I could barely bring myself to look at the screen, so badly was his character written.There's some minor amusement to be had from the dated technology and it's a relief that the awful Margot Kidder has barely any screen time, but the film's so poorly made it's difficult to watch. The idea of an ""evil Superman"" is a good one but underdeveloped, although it does set up a fun action scene in a scrapyard later on. Annette O'Toole is a far more charming love interest than Kidder ever was, but even her sub-plot is sidetracked in favour of more relentless inanity. Could it get any worse than this? I doubt it, somehow...",Superman III
2,SnoopyStyle,Richard Pryer makes up for some of its deficiencies,6,23 March 2014,"Gus Gorman (Richard Pryor) is thrown off unemployment after 36 weeks. He discovers that he's naturally gifted as a computer genius. Wealthy businessman Ross Webster (Robert Vaughn) finds Gorman's scheme stealing his money and uses Gorman's skills for his own corrupt gains. Meanwhile Clark (Christopher Reeve) goes back to Smallville and reconnects with Lana Lang (Annette O'Toole). Webster sends Gorman to Smallville to take over a satellite. Eventually he creates a synthetic Kryptonite that turns Superman dark.This is the much maligned follow up to the original two. I seem to like it more than most people. Whereas the comedy in this franchise is often campy, at least Richard Pryor provides a real comedian to direct the jokes. What this one lacks that was in Superman II is the great villain Zod. It becomes a series of rescues like firemen rescuing treed cats. The introduction of Lana Lang could have led to some good romantic entanglements. However the general public, still pulling for Lois Lane, was probably put off by his change of heart. They probably still pine for the missing Lois Lane and Lex Luthor days. And I actually like the supercomputer set. For all of its problems, Richard Pryer's likability makes up for much of its deficiencies.",Superman III
3,classicsoncall,"""Superman, you're just in a slump.""",4,15 July 2012,"If I were the Salkind's or Richard Lester, or quite frankly anyone who had anything to do with this movie I'd be embarrassed, up to and including Christopher Reeve. I mention Reeve with all due respect because he's not around to have his say about it anymore. But this was simply terrible. In fact it's terrible right from the start with the contrived attempt at slapstick comedy with the opening scene that just doesn't work for an iconic character like Superman. If you wanted to put the Man of Steel into this kind of universe, than make it totally Bizarro World, or better yet, bring in Mr. Mxyzptlk so you could blame the nonsense on an other-dimensional character.In terms of story continuity I was left baffled time and time again. How is it for example that Clark/Superman at one moment is attending his Smallville High School reunion, and then suddenly is straightening out the Leaning Tower of Pisa? What's the connection? Or sitting on a bar stool in St. Louis getting wasted as the alter-ego 'villain' Superman? As if alcohol could affect Superman, but that's another issue. The elements of this story are so contrived and haphazard that it appears to have been made on the fly.As for the inclusion of Richard Pryor, had this picture any kind of sensibility his presence might have been a useful one. As it is, he uses the typical mannerisms he's known for in films like ""Stir Crazy"", but here he's just not funny at all. Nor is Robert Vaughn an effective villain; his character as far as I can determine didn't even exist in the comics, so there's no back story a comic book fan can relate to.As awful as some of the half hour Superman TV shows of the Fifties were, I'd be inclined to recommend any one of them over this sequel. I guess the best way I can put this is to refer to Gus Gorman's (Pryor) scheme to take all those half cents and divert them into his own personal payroll account. Take all the story elements involved in this picture, mix them up at random, and you wind up with something that only makes half sense.",Superman III
4,gavin6942,Like Office Space With a Super Hero,6,17 September 2006,"After making two fairly decent Superman movies, things took a slightly different turn with Superman III. Gene Hackman was nowhere to be found, Lois Lane has such a small part that she's essentially not even in the continuity anymore (Clark apparently forgets all about his love of Lois when he re-meets Lana Lang). And things became really funny, or were at least supposed to be. If you consider ""campy"" to be funny.Superman faces off against himself, after being exposed to a new form of kryptonite that has tobacco tar mixed in. Can the world trust a Superman who destroys oil tankers and sleeps with random women on top of the Statue of Liberty? The best part of the ""Evil Superman"" sequence is when we see Superman drunk, if for no other reason than the thought of Superman getting drunk (or even having the ability to become intoxicated) is a most unusual thought. Good thing Superman doesn't drive a car.I really enjoyed the entrance of Lana Lang into the film. Lana, in my opinion, was always the more appropriate match for Superman and there is no exception in this movie. She shares a history with him, is more caring than Lois and less dominant. I'm curious where the Lois/Lana thing will go in Part 4, if it goes anywhere. (I am not suggesting dominant women are bad, by the way. But the fact of the matter is anyone dating Superman is going to have to be comfortable with being second fiddle.) What sold me on this movie (and almost scored it a 7 instead of a 6) is the tie-in with ""Office Space"". In Office Space, Superman III is referenced for a computer program that takes fractions of a cent and puts them in a bank account. The scene in this film was great, and really made me appreciate the way Mike Judge used it many years later.With nicotine and tar being the secret ingredients in the new kryptonite, was there some message being sent? Richard Pryor was great. He was funny and made the entire film more of a comedy with kitsch than the serious films we had seen before. Many people really didn't like the campiness, I guess, but I thought it was enjoyable for the most part (though they did go over the top just a bit). In my mind, Superman was the light story and Batman the dark story, so I'd rather see a silly Superman than a silly Batman.The new villain to replace Lex Luthor was okay, but why bother making a new villain if he's going to be the exact same character? I would hope after fifty years of comic books, there would have been at least one other super villain they could have chosen (although the new ""Superman Returns"" focuses on Luthor again, so I guess creativity is minimal in the Superman world).If you've seen parts one and two, you may as well see this. But do keep in mind that the world of Superman turns a little ""bizarro"" for the next two hours of film time...",Superman III
5,jboothmillard,Superman III,3,10 March 2011,"The first film was a huge success, the sequel was almost as good, but sadly this third film is when the series completely sags and it is obvious it was the beginning of the end, from director Richard Lester (A Hard Day's Night, Robin and Marian). Basically Superman aka Clark Kent (Christopher Reeve) is still busy and popular saving the lives of everyone in the city of Metropolis, and no mortal or from other planet enemies have managed to defeat him. Meanwhile we see computer genius Gus Gorman (Razzie nominated Richard Pryor) being a bit villainous, working out a way to steal thousands from the company he gets a job in. His skills attract the attention of wealthy business Ross Webster (Robert Vaughn), and decides to exploit his talent to help his plans to for economical control, starting of course with the ridding of Superman. They know that the only that can stop the Man of Steel, his only weakness, is Kryptonite, so with the help of Gus he works out the ingredients needed to create a piece of the substance, but with an unknown ingredient identified, he improvises and puts tar in the mixture. It should be mentioned that since he reversed the memory of Lois Lane Margot Kidder, who wanted nothing to do with this sequel, due to director Richard Donner being fired), Clark is spending time with his old flame from Smallville High School, Lana Lang (Annette O'Toole). At an event Gus gives Superman this piece of new ""Kryptonite"", which he accepts and seems to have no reaction to, but slowly it turns out it did have an effect, he is slowly turning, becoming selfish, angry and depressed. His darker side has pretty much completely taken over, but in a junkyard his true self is pushed out, so the dark Superman and Clark Kent are two halves, and they fight each other until the darker side is strangled to death and disappears into thin air. Restored, Superman goes to beat Webster, who with Gus has managed to find the true ingredients to create the real Kryptonite to weaken the superhero, but in the end of course he is strong enough to defeat the villains, while letting Gus go. Also starring Annie Ross as Vera Webster, Pamela Stephenson as Lorelei Ambrosia, Jackie Cooper as Perry White, Marc McClure as Jimmy Olsen and Larry Lamb as Miner. It was in the first few minutes with characters in the street being dumb and stupid with mishaps that I knew this was going to be terrible with rubbish attempts to make the audience laugh. Reeve is still a good as the superhero, and also makes a reasonable turn becoming an evil side, the fight between the two Superman sides is pretty good, Pryor is almost completely out of place, Vaughn is indeed no real replacement for Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor, and Stephenson is silly as the dumb villain's girlfriend. The special effects in most moments are unintentionally laughable, the story is wonky and not all interesting, and the attempted comedy streak just doesn't work, a rather disappointing fantasy action adventure sequel. It was nominated the Razzie for Worst Musical Score for Giorgio Moroder. Superman was number 26 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, and he was number 72 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Pretty poor!",Superman III
6,ma-cortes,Third fun adventure with physical comedy and predictable comic-strip action,7,12 May 2020,"A fun and thrilling follow-up in which Superman : Christopher Reeve falls temporarily in distress when is poisoned by synthetic kryptonite containing nicotine tar. As villainous Ross Rob Webster : Robert Vaughn attempts to defeat Superman via the expertise of bumbling computer wizz Gus Gorman : Richard Pryor and the judicious use of an artificial mineral, it results in some impresive and amusing scenes in which Superman battles his doppleganger. Along the way Superman carries out some botchers as blowing up the olympic torch, breaks a petrol ship resulting in polluting the ocean with oil and straightens up the Tower of Pisa, among others . However, absence of Lois Lane : Margot Kidder as main role , exception for some brief final scenes, instead the big guy takes up with former flame Lana Lang : Annette O'Toole.The most refreshing and by some the best of the three Superman main entries. The film is fast-moving, enjoyable and amusing, apart from the expendable romantic interludes when Superman falls again for an old flame, being an agreeable piece of first-class entertainment . Funny and clever screenplay by David Newman with a promising satiric start that is uneven developed through the movie, though providing a good sprinkly of funny lines. The film contains thrills, abundant special effects, and noisy action that boasts both a wickest sense of humour and a joyous zing. Here Superman explores his darkest aspect after undertaking a deep tranformation into sleaze side. Fine cast with Christopher Reeve who is pretty good and excels in the between good and bad Superman. As well as Richard Pryor as a true showman playing a crooked computer genius, at his best. Fx are well up to the mark, though including a dated matte painting, at times. As there are enough over-the-top traditional as well as modern digital effects to satisfy the most avid Science Fiction and Fantasy fans. Along with two main starring : Christopher Reeve, Richar Pryor there are other charming secondaries delivering sympathetic interpretations, such as : Robert Vaughn, Pamela Stephenson, Annette O'Toole, Annie Ross, Jackie Cooper, Marc McClure, Gavan O'Herlihy, Graham Stark, and many others.Sparkling technicolor cinematography by Robert Paynter lends the top-dressing to the proceedings. And, of course, nice soundtrack by Ken Thorne based on the great and prolific composer John Williams, including the classic leitmotif. The picture was inventive and professionally directed by Richard Lester giving a witty approach, outstanding an intelligent dual characterization on Superman . Lester is a good filmmaker working from the Sixties and with penchant for comedy, as he directed the following ones : Petulia, A hard day's night, Help, A funny thing happened on the way to the Forum, The Ritz, The mouse on the moon, Royal Flash, Finders keepers, The bed sitting room, Juggernaut, Butch and Sundance the early days, Three musketeers, Four musketeers, The return of musketeers.This high-flying series about Superman produced by Alexander, Yla Salkind are as follows : Superman 1978 by Richard Donner with Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, Gene Hackman, Ned Beatty, Jackie Cooper, Trevor Howard, Marlon Brando, Terence Stamp, Maria Schell, Marc McClure . Superman 2 , 1980, by Richard Lester with Reeve, Kidder, Terence Stamp, Sarah Douglas. Superman, the quest for peace 1987 by Sidney J Fury with Reeve, Sam Wanamaker, John Cryer , Gene Hackman, Margot Kidder, Marc Pillow. And in similar style Supergirl 1984 by Jeannot Szwarc with Helen Slater, Faye Dunaway, Peter Cook, Mia Farrow.",Superman III
7,Quinoa1984,That is a bad script-fit!,5,19 June 2021,"First question on Superman 3: How does Gus Gorman do ANYTHING he is doing in this? Where does he come from? Why is Gus Gorman? Like... he just stumbled on to this computer gig and manages to have the capabilities of the guy in Die Hard who hacks into the Nakatomi tower times 100. It is just so so wild how this plot stumbles along like a drunkard - or more precisely someone on coke riding an elevator up and down to hell - and Superman gets stuck in the middle with some good scenes with Lana Lang (Annette O'Toole innocent) and then be becomes Bad Superman from handling some Kryptonite that is not the usual Kryptonite and does a series of things like fixing the tower of Piza from leaning and like spraying an oil tanker all over the ocean and... WHAT IS THIS?!Superman III is less a movie than a collection of scenes stuck together from a not convoluted but just bizarre plot by Robert Vaughan to control the world's oil and Lex Luthor would look at this mishegas and be like ""Calm down, sir!"" There's no narrative momentum because it's moreso Gus Gorman's story and we don't really know on a basic level what he *wants* except that he's kind of being blackmailed because of his thievery early on and he wants to use his unexplained computer genius to do a whole lot more than we think he can do and... huh?It hit me late in the film by the time we get to that super computer in the mountain: this is a series of comic books from a run stuck together, yet it's a run where different writers and artists came and went without a clear plan and at the same time you can see certain ideas that got laughs and pats on the back in the room. While the movie is still lurching forward after that spectacular comic-action junkyard fight, it has these little nuggets like the one character who becomes a robot and how that creates some memorable mania even as the bulk of the action in this scene is poor.All the while, I like how the Evil Superman is still a dork - sorry/not sorry, I also enjoy the ""Bad"" Peter Parker stuff in Spiderman 3 (a better movie than this, fight me) so this worked for me - and Christopher Reeve is still so astonishing as a fully endearing being as Sups and Kent, and moreover makes the bad Superman different than how he has been, and he's giving the character 10,000% every scene (yes, that horror drunk bar gif included), and I admire the uncanny comic swagger Lester has with the garbage dump scene. I don't think this has, what the word I'm looking for ah yes, stakes that the movie could ever earn (like, why does Superman going bad matter for *this* movie), but divorced from any context it's a memorable sequence in and of itself.In other words, what 80s All Over said years ago holds true. WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT? WHAT ARE WE WATCHING? Oh, and Pryor looks so adrift here, like Anything for a Paycheck mode (an interesting thought given Gorman himself). A totally fascinating mess of a movie that I'm sure I'd have stronger feelings on had I see it at 7 instead of 37 but here we all are.PS: A simple fix for this story - Gus Gorman isn't some unfortunate dude without a job at the start who joins this company with this hackneyed plot (gee where did that get reused again, #stapler), but he has been working for years for Vaughan and has gone disgruntled. In other words, Batman Forever with Nygma is a better version of this basic antagonist plot - and if Lester had more balls he would've just cast Pryor as a villain instead of someone stuck in the middle.",Superman III
8,sunwarrior13,"Without Donner and Hackman,Superman III Becomes A Disaster",6,24 October 2011,"The third Superman film departs from the first two films and it becomes a slapstick comedy and a joke with less interest on the complexities of the characters and adventures.In fact,Superman himself becomes two characters - one good and other other a villain which makes it even more funny.Superman III is the third film in the Superman film series based upon the long-running DC Comics superhero.It stars Christopher Reeve and Richard Pryor together with Jackie Cooper, Marc McClure and Margot Kidder are joined by new cast members Annette O'Toole, Annie Ross, Pamela Stephenson, Robert Vaughn.It was directed by Richard Lester.When the movie starts,Gus Gorman,played by comedian Richard Pryor, and a subsequent slapstick sequence upstage Superman, who later develops an identity crisis. Gorman, newly trained as a computer whiz, starts working for a conglomerate run by the corporate nemesis Ross Webster,played by Robert Vaughn,intent on world domination. Gorman is sent to Superman's small town of Smallville to wipe out Columbia's coffee crop by fiddling with the computer side of a weather satellite. Clark Kent is in town for his class reunion, leading Superman to clash with Gorman, which in turn, leads Gorman to develop a hybrid red Kryptonite. Unwittingly, the Red Kryptonite causes Superman to split into a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde schizophrenia -- but in two separate bodies. As the evil Superman swaggers around town, megalomaniac Ross Webster has other tricks in mind -- and in one of the more memorable action scenes, Superman is chased through the Grand Canyon by a fast-flying, very determined missile. Lana Lang is on hand for romantic interest.The third film becomes a big joke!!!!It diminished everything that the first two films stood for in exchange for comedy especially with Pryor's presence.Aside from that,Vaughn's villainous portrayal of Ross Webster was an uninspired fill-in for Lex Luthor or the Supervillains.Of course,the big blame goes for Richard Lester,a director who more into comedy rather adventure films like Superman.It would have been better that they have retained Richard Donner for the Superman franchise,who could have done a better job with it.Added to that,the absence of Gene Hackman and the near-absence of Margot Kidder,who was limited to 5 minutes of screen time by Salkinds for expressing her disgust on the firing of Donner,proved disastrous to the film. Obviously,the love story between Lana Lang and Clark Kent isn't as interesting as compared to Lois Lane and Superman/Clark Kent after what they have gone through in the first two films.The only good thing about it is the performance of Christopher Reeve,who proved himself to be have great acting skills when portraying the good and evil Superman. Overall,if you are looking for some laughs,the Superman III is the film to watch!!!!!!!!",Superman III

10,hitchcockthelegend,Never underestimate the power of computers.,6,10 May 2009,"After being caught for a money making computer scam, Gus Gorman (Richard Pryor - wonderful) is recruited by unscrupulous multimillionaire Ross Webster (Robert Vaughn). With Gorman's computer expertise, Webster plans to take complete economic control. But first there is the considerable issue of eradicating Superman first...Richard Lester, as everyone now knows, inherited Superman 2 from the jettisoned Richard Donner. Here we have a complete Richard Lester Superman film, and from the extended slapstick opening we are aware that this is far lighter in tone than the previous two films. Lester's credits are steeped in comedy traditions, so it's no real surprise that Superman 3 is more airy comic book than troubled caped crusader. This is something that many franchise fans are completely unforgiving about. Which is a shame, because viewed as a comic book bit of nonsense it's a rather enjoyable film, certainly it's the one with the most fun approach.The action is very well put together, with a franchise highlight as Clark Kent (Christopher Reeve) gets to fight a clearly off kilter Superman (erm, Reeve again), and the comedy, if accepted on its own terms, is very rewarding. Annette O'Toole (adorable) takes the lead love interest role for this one, with Margo Kidder only along for cameo duties. Pamela Stephenson is on hand for some sex bomb side-kick to Vaughn work, and Annie Ross gest the annoying domineering sibling role and gets her teeth and ""wires"" into it.All told, it's not a ground shaking superhero film, but it does work as entertainment if one can cast off the mythology of Superman and his fantastical complexities. To do so is not a crime against ones superhero beliefs, it's just an acceptance that this is a different approach, and that Superman 3's only real crime is not being as good as the two film's that preceded it. Hey, just think, ""Quest For Peace"" was around the corner... 6/10",Superman III
11,Theo Robertson,Wasn't Well Written Was It ?,5,30 May 2005,"It's obvious as soon as SUPERMAN 3 starts that not a lot of thought has gone into the screenplay of this movie , I mean the opening sequence is taken up by an unlikely sketch of someone paying attention to a sexy blond , not looking where they're going then BANG all sorts of mayhem ensues . It's like watching a very tired episode of THE BENNY HILL SHOW and seeing Bob Todd in a walk on part does nothing to help this feelingYou could claim that the producers are more to blame than the screenwriters David and Leslie Newman because the previous two entries were somewhat disjointed plot wise and those previous movies were written by that guy who wrote THE GODFATHER but even so this sequel is the worst written of the first three movies in the series where we get two different plots competing for screen time and needless disasters that call for Superman to save the day every ten minutes . Notice too that main villain Robert Webster has cruel put downs involving innuendo like "" Get a hold of your self - because no one else will "" . Very witty , except all the characters in this movie seem to be able to spout these type of crude witticisms indicating that the writers are incapable of writing idiosyncratic dialogue for the characters in this movie",Superman III
12,zardoz-13,Superman Versus Richard Pryor,7,17 April 2014,"The ambitious but uneven ""Superman III"" underlines comedy and slights drama. ""A Hard Day's Night"" director Richard Lester and ""What's Up, Doc?""scenarists David and Leslie Newman allow Richard Pryor to indulge himself as villainous but accommodating Gus Gorman. Pryor imitates Superman in one scene with a pink tablecloth. In other scenes, he dresses a fast-talking, chummy, rube in a suit liquor salesman and later masquerades as General George Patton. Most of the time, Pryor amuses us with his crazy antics, but the comic approach seems out of place in what should have been a straightforward ""Superman"" saga like the original and its sequel. The opening credit sequence depicts chaos forged by a babe whose sexy demeanor triggers a Rube Goldberg series of accidents. Meantime, the Man of Steel is appropriately heroic, while Clark Kent is hopelessly goofy. At one point, Kal-El freezes a lake to douse a chemical fire. He uses his sensitive hearing to locate a whining dog beside its fallen master in a hay field with harvesters bearing down on them. He rescues a man who is drowning inside his own car. He blows an oil spill back into the tanker ship! Tycoon Ross Webster (Robert Vaughn of ""The Magnificent Seven"") replaces Lex Luthor from the previous two outings. The dastardly Webster wallows in so much dough that he never has to wear the same pair of socks twice. He is wealthy enough to have a ski slope built atop his skyscraper apartment. Webster persuades computer embezzler August Gorman (Richard Pryor) to carry out his schemes of economic world conquest by manipulating computers to change things. Warner Brothers should have called this epic ""Superman Vs. Richard Pryor. Essentially, Pryor plays an unemployed African-American computer genius. He isn't the chief villain, but a henchman who gets in over his head with Ross. Gus is the lynchpin character and seems more interesting than Superman.""Superman III"" opens with August Gorman (Richard Pryor of ""Car Wash"") awaiting his weekly unemployment check. Sadly, Gus hasn't been able to find stable employment after 36 weeks of searching for work so the city cuts off his benefits. As he is about to leave the employment office, he borrows a book of matches from a brother and sees on the match book that he can earn big money as a computer programmer. Later, Gus winds up taking computer classes at Archibald School of Data Processing. The opening credits occur in downtown Metropolis as all Hell breaks loose. Lorelei Ambrosia sets off the chaos with her clingy white dress covered with strawberries. She totes a strawberry shaped purse, too. A robber holds up a bank, and the police blast away at him as he flees. The cop's bullet strikes a motorist's car and he smashes into a water hydrant. Clark Kent has already blown out a flaming penguin when he spots the motorist drowning in his own automobile. Our hero ducks into a photo booth, tears off three photos of him as Clark Kent, hands his Superman picture to a kid, and then rips the sun roof off the car to save the motorist. Afterward, Kent convinces Perry White to let him attend his high school reunion and turn it into a story. Lois sets off on her vacation to Bermuda and we don't see her again until the last ten minutes. Anyhow, Clark encounters a chemical fire along the way, and Superman puts it out in the most singular fashion. Meanwhile, greedy Gus embezzles over $85-thousand by funneling off the half-cents into his expense account. Ross is impressed with Gus' computer skills, and he persuades Gus to do his dirty work for him. It seems that Webster has been looking for a computer genius. Eventually, Gus convinces Webster to build the ultimate computer. This computer is comparable to HAL in ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" Not only is it the biggest computer in the world, but also this computer can defend itself against attack.The original 1978 ""Superman"" had its share of comedy, but humor pervades ""Superman III."" The dry humor at the beginning looks like something that Blake Edwards might have staged for one of his comedies. Of course, Pryor is always a pleasure, and Christopher Reeve gives Superman greater depth. Tricked into accepting fake kryptonite from Gus as General Patton, Superman splits up into a good and a bad Superman. Lester gives us a glimpse of the Man of Steel as we have never seen him. We see Superman blow out a torch at an athletic event and get drunk at a bar. Moreover, Superman makes time with Lana while a trucker dies that he could have saved. Robert Vaughn has some memorable moments as Ross Webster. He has about three ironic lines. ""I ask you to kill Superman, and you're telling me you couldn't even do that one, simple thing."" Even earlier, with a hint of irony, Webster says, ""Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed. Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed."" Superman battles with the computer and the villains challenge him with their technology. When he isn't tangling with Webster and Gus, Clark Kent rekindles a romance with Lana Lang (Annette O'Toole) who has a son. Unfortunately, her son Ricky has no father to play with.""Superman III"" qualifies as ambitious but uneven. Richard Pryor steals the show, but Christopher Reeves embellishes his performance.",Superman III
13,Boba_Fett1138,More campy fun with Superman.,5,12 December 2005,"""Superman III"" isn't really a terrible movie but it's more a movie that has some flaws in it, which causes the movie to be a below average one to watch.The story really isn't that bad and works fine as a campy-comedy. The way the story is however told at times make the movie look lame and silly. So good moments in the story are ruined and not executed correctly by director Richard Lester, who just isn't Richard Donner, no matter how hard he tries.Of course the charm and atmosphere of the first movie is longtime gone. Only thing that is left is the typical humor of the first movie. This movie is quite honestly more a comedy than it is an action movie. It makes the movie fun to watch as long as you don't take it all too seriously. The atmosphere and story is even more campy as it was in ""Superman II"".The movie really misses Lois Lane and Lex Luthor. Lois Lane has been extremely limited done in this movie and the main villain is this time portrayed by Robert Vaughn. He is a great actor but he just is no Gene Hackman. Hackman made the first two movies extremely likable and watchable and at the same time gave the movie some extra style and sense of profession. This time the love interested for Clark Kent is Lana Lang who simply is no Lois Lane. There isn't really any chemistry on screen and their love-story isn't worked out good enough.I was actually watching this movie when I heard the news that Richard Pryor had passed away, that was a pretty weird and freaky experience and caused the news to be extra shocking. I knew his health was declining rapidly the last couple of years but still his death came as unexpected. He was excellent in this movie and made it great as a comedy. There are some hilarious comical moments that involves his character. He was truly one of the highlights of this movie and prevented this movie from being completely lame and ridicules.The movie is extremely simple executed which wasn't always good for the story. Yes, there are some good scene's such as the Clark Kent versus Superman thing that was thought up pretty well and there most certainly were some hilarious comical moments that were truly fun, B-movie, campy like, at times. But most of the good moments are ruined by the poor execution of the movie in general.Still it can be a very fun movie to watch as long as you don't take it all too serious.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Superman III
14,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Superman is about as confused as the audience,5,12 August 2006,"Christoper Reeves' biography page contains a quote explaining that Richard Lester, who re-(and, some would say, mis-)directed most of Donner's footage in the second movie and did all of this, was ""always looking for a gag"". This film proves that beyond any doubt. Following a hard-to-read title sequence over a scene of slapstick that would have had(and quite possibly did have) Benny Hill shaking his head and averting his eyes(featuring none other than Bob Todd, who often appeared with Hill), the entire film is a long line of attempted jokes. I say attempted because Lester has little respect for or understanding of comedy(nor the character of mythology of Superman, as has been firmly established); any joke needs proper setup for the punchline to have any effect, and no joke should be *immediately* followed by another, with no room to laugh in-between. This is similar to a recent and unfortunate development in the genre of action films, where a director who doesn't understand the need for the slow-down in-between the major action sequences, to allow the audience to breathe, to take in what they've just seen. Now, without these much-needed breaks in-between, the film basically becomes one very long sketch. Had this been a TV-special with a fraction of the running time and the title ""Silly Superman"", perhaps it would have been tolerable. I don't care much for Pryor. Maybe fans of him will enjoy his performance. The acting is all overplayed... even in the case of newly added Annette O'Toole, who's definitely displayed her talent on Smallville. Clark continues to be a fish-out-of-water and more there for comic relief than anything else. The dialog and various actions of the characters are rarely too credible, and most of the film is marred by the overly comic-book-like tone. The humor has taken what must be the last leap downwards, not only reaching the very bottom but going through it. While the conflict seen at one point in the film, between the good-natured Clark Kent and the now-evil Superman could have proved to be interesting, it isn't used for anything, and ends up simply being an action scene. Near the very end of the film, the quality of the writing takes a solid dive... and yes, I, too, was surprised that it could manage to go any lower. Wasting the potential of an excellent science fiction idea put forth many, many years back and using it just to throw more adversity into our hero's path, the plot twist is unexpected and without any grounds in logic or any remainder of proper storytelling. As if the writer had no actual ideas left, and just threw in whatever sprung to mind. Then again, the film itself seems like one big case of that. The pacing is consistently off. The cinematography retains its comic-book look and feel. The special effects are of slightly lesser quality than the former efforts... easier to tell, less convincing. Margot Kidder, who portrays Lois Lane, confronted the producers of the film to complain about the firing of Donner on the second film... with the result that her part was cut down to an absolute minimum(though so unusually(for this film, and the other by Lester) well-explained that you wouldn't notice it unless you thought hard). To me, that seems like a juvenile act, and an abuse of power(though I will admit, I can't say for sure that I missed the character in this... Lana Lang certainly provided an interesting new development, if one of the only good things in this at all). All in all... this is probably a good place to skip this attempt at making a film series out of the character. This is not a good film at all... and from what I've heard, it only gets worse in the next one. I recommend this to those fans who *must* see every piece of film regarding the hero... and I urge you to save some episodes of Smallville, or perhaps the Singer film(soon to be plural) for after, to see a better representation as well as a more skilled execution of him. 5/10",Superman III
15,neil-476,Welcome to Superman III: Richard Pryor,6,1 November 2009,"Superman III is a curate's egg. There is much in it which is very good - the good/bad Superman fight topping that particular list, giving Chris Reeve the opportunity to add a third characterisation to Superman and Clark.Yet there is much more in it which isn't good than was the case in the previous two movies. From a technical point of view, there are noticeably fewer effects, and they are noticeably shoddier (there is some appalling colour work on matted elements: one would have thought they would have been aware that Superman's costume is blue, not green!) But by far the worst element is Richard Pryor. Don't get me wrong - I like Richard Pryor, and the story (and Gus Gorman's part in it) was fine. But Pryor was allowed - possibly even encouraged - to overpower the film. Just as happened with the Burton run of Batman films, the focus moved away from the titular character to someone who should have been secondary. This is at its very worst in the truly dreadful sequence when Pryor is explaining Superman's feats in a sequence which should have centred on those feats instead of a verbal recounting of them.Potential - 9 out of 10, but delivery falls far short of this.",Superman III
16,AlsExGal,They really should have stopped with the second one...,4,4 April 2016,"...because this is a terrible sequel that nearly undoes all of the goodwill created by the first two films. Christopher Reeve returns as Superman, who, in his alter ego of Clark Kent, travels back to his hometown of Smallville to attend his high school reunion. While there, he crosses path with an evil business magnate (Robert Vaughn), his equally evil sister (Annie Ross), and Vaughn's ditzy assistant (Pamela Stephenson). They've hired a computer genius (Richard Pryor) to help develop a super computer to help in their plan for global domination. They also develop artificial kryptonite that turns Superman evil. You know he's evil because he quits shaving, has dingy clothes, and straightens the Leaning Tower of Pisa.Margot Kidder was fighting with the producers at this point, so her role as Lois Lane is reduced to short cameos at the beginning and end of the film. Jackie Cooper returns as Daily Planet editor Perry White, and Marc McClure as junior reporter Jimmy Olsen. Annette O'Toole appears as Kent's high school crush Lana Lang, and Gavan (Son of Dan) O'Herlihy as a drunken high school bully.Director Richard Lester tries to accentuate the comedy in this, but the script is so awful that nothing can save it. The effects are bargain basement as well, with some really shoddy miniature and matte work.THis film has one of the zaniest rather stand-alone moments in any film ever- near the end when the Super Computer the villains build starts malfunctioning and they try to flee. The villain's sister- who up to now really has served zero purpose in the story- is sucked into a claustrophobic compartment of the computer and- in one of the most disturbing moments that I can recall in what is supposed to be a relatively family friendly film - she screams in agony as the computer strangles her with wires and staples metal all over her face. She then emerges as the most ridiculous looking robot ever, by which I mean even Robbie the Robot would laugh at this thing.The director of this film had to have had some serious issues with his mother (or maybe his sister?).i just cannot fathom how it was felt by the writers that this was necessary or appropriate in a movie that children were going to want to see. Annie Ross is actually an accomplished jazz and standard vocalist who, i can only assume, was being blackmailed into appearing in this or really needed to pay off a loan or something.So this was the end of WB's relationship with the Christopher Reeve franchise of Superman. Given the goofiness of it all the fourth one was taken on by The Cannon Group, which was such a goofy production company that it was worthy of a documentary all of its own, and actually HAS a documentary all of its own.",Superman III
17,Uriah43,Superman Faces an Identity Crisis,5,28 August 2016,"Although he seems to be a nice guy ""Gus Gorman"" (Richard Pryor) is essentially a bum. He manages to scrape by on unemployment and when he does get a job he doesn't keep it for very long. Then one day he notices an ad offering training for computer programming and he discovers that he is a natural at it. Soon he finds low-level employment working for a multi-national conglomerate and becomes dismayed when he gets his first paycheck. However, his income changes dramatically when he ingeniously comes up with a plan to acquire the small percentages normally rounded up by the computer and subsequently transfers them to his payroll account. Unfortunately, this penny shaving technique is caught by the accountants who immediately inform the CEO by the name of ""Ross Webster"" (Robert Vaughn). Yet, rather than being angry, Ross is so impressed with Gus' ability that he talks him into a scheme to hack into other computers in order make a fortune for him and his small group of conspirators. While all of this is going on, ""Superman"" (Christopher Reeve) has assumed his alternate identity as ""Clark Kent"" and gone back to Smallville to attend a high school reunion and while there he gets caught up in a relationship with ""Lana Lang"" (Annette O'Toole). Now, initially I had high hopes for this movie. Unfortunately, film seemed to get side-tracked by repeated (and mostly unsuccessful) attempts at humor and numerous sub-plots which only served to detract from the movie as a whole. On that note, at times it seemed like Gus Gorman was the main character rather than Superman. But that's just my opinion. In any case, while I don't consider this movie to be necessarily bad, I must admit I was somewhat disappointed and because of that I have rated it accordingly. Average.",Superman III

Only good sequence has Clark Kent returning to Smallville for his High School reunion(Where he meets up with Lana Lang, played by the beautiful Annette O'Toole), but the rest of the film is so bad, that it makes little difference.Robert Vaughn plays an evil industrialist who discovers some krypton, and uses Pryor to make it kill Superman, but things don't go according to plan. Absurd climax further sinks this mess into an utter farrago.Christopher Reeve is still appealing, but wasted with such inferior material.",Superman III

Ross decides to abuse his talents, in a way to help Webster with his plans for economic control. When the man of steel interferes, something must be done about him. When Gus' synthetic Kryptonite fails to kill Superman, it turns him in an evil incarnation of his former self. The tar-laced Kryptonite pits man against himself, setting up a Superman vs. Superman battle.....In terms of franchises, Superman is one of the strangest ones going. The first two defined the comic book movie, and were two of the best hero movies made until the advent of Marvel and the releasing of a comic book movies almost every week.Then the this and four were released, and killed the franchise, and then Singer made another, which was arguably a little bit boring.There are some good things about this movie though, and the pivotal point of this movie was the bad Superman sub-plot. Its not just the best part of the movie, it's one of the stand out scenes of the whole five movies.Seeing Reeve let himself go a bit is wonderful, and it's a nice change from all the niceness that oozes from the hero.Pryor is good, but is very out of place in a film like this. A little humour is good, but when a film turns to almost parody on the strength of a stand up comedian, it doesn't have faith in the movie, hence the audience losing faith.Vaughn is a weak substitute for Hackman, and acts more like a child than a megalomaniac.But there is still fun to have, the opening montage is genuinely funny, and the final scene with the robot lady still freaks me out a bit today, but as a sequel to two wonderful movies, it stinks...",Superman III
20,Aaron1375,It has its moments.,6,3 February 2003,"I sort of like this film...definately better than 4, it amazes me how many people say they actually think 4 is better.  This movie is almost a pure comedy except for some scenes.  Reeve is tolerable in this one...another thing I can't believe is how many people think Reeves was so great as Superman.  I know a bunch of people who could have done better, just cause the man had a terrible accident doesn't mean you have to praise his acting ability (other than Superman he has basically done nothing).  Reeve does his best when he plays the dark superman.  Richard Pyror steals the show though and is the main reason I like this one.  Blessedly gone is Margot Kidder who only has a brief cameo.  Like I said this one is more of a comedy and it isn't trying to take itself to seriously...to bad the same can't be said for 4.",Superman III
21,Wuchakk,More than what it first appears,6,4 February 2013,"""Superman III"" (1983) gets a lot of flack because of the inclusion of slapstick, a parody tone and Richard Pryor, but it is entertaining once you get used to the tone and the presence of Pryor.Christopher Reeve as Superman is good, of course, but you also have Robert Vaughn as the Luthor-like villain and Pamela Stephenson as his attractive female assistant a la Miss Teschmacher. The cast really excels with the inclusion of the beautiful Annette O'Toole as Lana Lang, a sort of replacement for Lois Lane, who barely appears. Annette is a pleasure to behold throughout.Once you get used to the too-goofy approach the film really takes off in the second half with Superman fighting his dark side, an obvious type of the inner conflict of flesh & spirit within us all. Even more, there's the satisfying redemption of a certain character that illustrates how a person can make a huge mistake and still be applicable for redemption, as long as he or she is willing. The film just leaves you with a good feeling.BOTTOM LINE: It's not great like the first two, but ""Superman III"" delivers if you overlook all the bashing and give it a chance. Richard Pryor is goofy, but likable while Annette O'Toole shines. Most of all, the movie is deeper than what meets the eye and effectively conveys powerful truths about the human condition and potential.The film runs 2 hours, 4 minutes.GRADE: B-/B.",Superman III
22,Mr-Fusion,"The Richard Pryor Movie, co-starring Superman!",2,27 January 2012,"There's an interesting subplot in ""Superman III"" in which Superman goes bad (complete with 5 o'clock shadow and dark colors). Beyond that point of interest, this film is a disaster.For no discernible reason, the powers-that-be decided to turn Superman into a comedy. Central to that is the casting of Richard Pryor as the bum-turned-hacker-supreme who creates trouble for the Man of Steel (but he's just the stooge, not a villain). Also central is an overall comedic tone that turns everything (read: everything) into a ha-ha. The opening credits sequence is a series of sight gags, pratfalls and comic mischief, turning the citizens of Metropolis into hapless buffoons. It's this general attitude that threads through the duration of the movie, turning the sequel to arguably the greatest Superman film ever made (II) into a grueling slog of cheap laughs. Not cool.To his credit, Reeve plays the character straight as always, making the big ""save the day"" setpieces welcoming respites from the film's idea of comedy. But it was a sinking ship at the script stage. Fraught with pacing issues, ""Superman III"" has a two-hour runtime that feels like three. And there's not really a bad guy. Sure, there's Robert Vaughn playing a poor Lex Luthor imitation, but he's just a money-hungry tycoon. He's no threat to Superman. And the majority of Pryor's presence is just uncomfortable to watch. Young 'uns should take heed that the man's comedic charms are best seen in his stand-up routine. Not here.It's unfortunate the Salkinds decided to go in this direction with the series. It didn't have to be a gagfest written around the star presence of Pryor, and it didn't have to feel so cheap. What's most upsetting about watching ""Superman III"" (aside from waiting for something to happen) is that Lester and Co. delivered a pie-in-the-face to the heart and verisimilitude of the Donner film. For that reason, this is the worst of the series, for me. Even ""Quest for Peace"" had good intentions. This was just a cheap shot.2/10",Superman III

24,StevePulaski,Would be great if the title character wasn't practically a supporting character,4,22 July 2013,"If there were ever a film to bleed early-eighties, cinematic camp it's, unfortunately, the third sequel to the original Superman franchise. It's no doubt certain pictures can pull off the aforementioned camp to great effect, but after two serious (well, somewhat straight-forward) films centered around the Man of Steel, here is the third installment, which can't even take itself seriously, leading to the audience not being able to take it seriously. What happened? Were the filmmakers shocked they got this far? If you were a die-hard fan of the first two Superman films, Superman III is at least something of a significant disappointment. Director Richard Lester returns using the one great thing him and the three writers brought to Superman II in extreme excess, which was providing light-hearted comedy and borderline satirical elements of the superhero genre. Here, his direction feels flatter than before and the Newmans, David and Leslie, write the film with a comedic tone that feels out of place.Most notably, the film features a watchable, but often half-baked performance by Richard Pryor who, despite enormous comedic talent and mainstream recognition, feels simultaneously overused and underused here. Overused in the regard that he seems to be the main star, where Superman is the supporting role in his own film, and underused because Pryor is never given much funny to do. He plays Gus Gorman, who goes from collecting unemployment checks to being a talented computer programmer, whose acts of embezzlement attract Ross Webster (Robert Vaughn). Webster wants to hack the computers of the world and create a financial monopoly on the wealth. Or something like that. In the process, he wants to effectively transform Superman (role reprised by Christopher Reeve) from the caped-do-gooder he is known to be to an evil brute with no compassion or morality at all.On top of this, Lois Lane is away covering a story in Bermuda (actress Margot Kidder probably found better things to occupy her time with), and Clark Kent goes to his high school reunion alone, only to reconnect with Lana Lang (Annette O'Toole), an old friend.This is all well and good, but where is the sly wit from the third film's predecessor that was presented very conservatively in the trailers? Where is the agony that Kent experienced as living two completely different lives? Where are the touching scenes with Lois and Clark? Everything that made the first two films likable and functional is omitted and what we're left with is a film that feels tired and obligatory. There is no longer the excitement there was in the first two installments. While some parts felt as if they were plastic and kind of cheesy, this entire effort feels plastic and cheesy. And when you have a sequel to a Superman film headlined by Richard Pryor, that's the last thing the project should feel.Superman III, as a whole, simply doesn't work. There's too little energy, not enough drama to care about, too much emphasis on a campy personality, Ross Webster as an archetypal villain doesn't invite much suspense as a whole, and Reeve, once again, does his best, although he is trying to humanize a rather bland hero and the only thing he is given interesting to do is to show Superman's evil side when the time comes. If Richard Pryor would've pulled something like he did in See No Evil, Hear No Evil - perhaps that scene when him and Gene Wilder are pulling out their car from the river - we'd have a movie. Or, you know, if the title character wasn't practically a supporting character.Starring: Christopher Reeve, Richard Pryor, Robert Vaughn, Jackie Cooper, Marc McClure, Annette O'Toole, Annie Ross, Pamela Stephenson, and Margot Kidder.

25,Smells_Like_Cheese,Superman vs. Richard Pryor... who will win the power of the silver screen?,4,2 November 2006,"I just watched Superman III and was excited to see Richard Pryor on the cover, but then I even thought as I was paying for the rental ""wait, why am I excited to see Richard Pryor more than Christopher Reeve?"", it was an interesting thought. But I was thinking maybe it's just because I was just more used to being excited about some kind of comedy, but the problem was that it seemed like the comedy took over what could've been a great super hero story.Superman/Clark Kent is now invited to his high school reunion where he sees his old high school crush and they hit it off. Gus, played by Pryor, is a computer worker, he is asked by a big boss to play with the computers and control the weather and more! But when Superman interferes with that, they decide to throw some kryptonite at him, but it fails, but turns Superman into a bad guy! Hence the alternate title of ""Superman vs. Superman"".Like I said, it just didn't seem to balance right with these two huge movie stars. In the 70's and 80's, Richard Pryor could do no wrong, he was so popular, and I think that overshadowed Christopher's presence on the screen. The comedy and drama didn't mesch well, I just think that this could've been a great sequel, but just didn't excel to what it could'v been.4/10",Superman III

The two alter-egos end up batting each other in a pretty captivating story and plot with some neat special effects. However, the more dramatic and suspenseful elements from the previous two films is replaced with more comedic elements in this sequel, especially surrounding Richard Pryor's Gus Gorman character.The acting, nonetheless, is pretty good. Reeve is amazing as Superman/Clark Kent as always and Pryor delivered some nice comedy and laughable moments. Annette O'Tootle gave a refreshing role as Lana Lang and had good on-screen chemistry with Clark Kent.This sequel, though, does have that lack of ""superhero"" feel to it probably do to its slapstick comedy elements.

30,thesar-2,Forget Tyson VS Ali. I want to see Superman VS Clark Kent!,5,19 July 2009,"Here is my essay on why 'Superman III' is actually better than **both** versions of 'Superman II.' I would never have agreed to that statement growing up – I really liked 'Superman II' and it wouldn't be decades later before the Richard Donner version is released. However, after watching with a closer eye, as an adult, the good actually outweighs the bad in all three movies ('II,' 'IIb' and 'III.')Still, 'III' wasn't that great of a movie. Pryor can play a drunk – he certainly seems drunk for most of this movie, but he was thoroughly unconvincing (even as slapstick) as an accidental computer hacker. Sure we're dealing with 1983, just shortly after computers the size of apartments were being reduced for everyday use. And I understand the whole use of a farce/fantasy, but the bubble gummed supercomputer was a bit much. (Although, it was a plausible foe for Superman, when there was an absolute absence of any real super-villain here.)In addition to suspending your disbelief for Pryor as Bill Gates, we also have: shameless walk-ons by series regulars, Kidder and Cooper, the upside down tornado (??), the campiness is in over-excess (I used to like the opening, but wow – this really is going to the juvenile extreme) and some of the special effects, or lazy effects see ""Superman: The 1983 Video Game!"" in closing), but I have always loved a lot of this movie. And here are 5 good reasons to actually watch what could've been a below-the-belt mediocre movie:#1 No Lex. Of the 5 'Superman' films, 4 have Lex as the villain; kudos to Batman for his variety on villains.#2 Though Kryptonite is overused in the series, at least they introduced ""Red Kryptonite,"" well, sorta. It's still green, but Superman fans will know the difference.And this brings up a good #3: We finally get to see a different Superman, the one Batman's always concerned about: sick Superman as a weapon vs. hero. Batman's concerned eventually Supe's going to unwillingly and uncontrollably turn on Earth, and 'III' finally explores this. (Minus Batman, that is.)#4 The score and music were very good – for the time, and the performances were better. Pryor was funny and had some decent lines, the blonde femme fetal, Stephenson, was hilarious when she thinks she's alone and they did an excellent job introducing the Lana Lang (O'Toole) character. She had great chemistry and lines with Clark, and paved the way eventually with the 'Smallville' TV series.#5 Though, I did like the chemical rescue scene, we get a much better Superman action sequence. Finally! Superman Vs. Clark Kent! Despite not being perfect (they seriously leave a pool of acid around for someone to fall into?) it was great seeing them go at it and good triumphant over evil. And the darken suit, Supe's messed up hair and attitude/disruption at the bar was a great new twist.Unfortunately, I still give it ***/5 stars. Because, despite its achievements, it really falters in comparison to any superhero movie, namely, 'Superman: The Movie' or later, 'Superman Returns.'Side note: I love all the little mannerisms Reeve showed in this one, he showed he thoroughly enjoyed playing Kent/Superman by this sequel and possibly the best acting range he's had in the series. One of the best he had was on the bus with Jimmy, when Jimmy droned on about his family. After seeing his ""sure, I'm paying attention on the outside, but I'm severely rolling my eyes inside"" scene as a kid, for some reason it stuck with me. (Almost the same scene goes on for a few segments in 'Airplane!' when Hays tells his neighbor a story of love lost.) I still use this, especially at break at work when almost everyone I come in contact with goes on and on with either boring stories or high drama. Though, it does get hard to keep that ""rolling eyes"" inside of me at times. For those times, I love sunglasses.",Superman III

This movie looks more like a lousy attempt of Marvel than DC. ""Superman III"" seems like a parody on its two prequels. It has too much humor and mostly lousy one for a decent superhero movie, so it reminds of mediocre B production 80's comedies. Reeve and Pryor are great, but it's not enough to cover for the lousy story. The plot is too cluttered and banal for a superhero movie and not funny enough for a comedy. If it was under 90 minutes it could be entertaining, but with over two hours length it becomes tiresome and boring, and it lost my attention somewhere around the middle. The only really awesome thing in this movie is Evil Superman vs. Clark Kent fight scene. I just want to add one interesting fact.

But that doesn't mean it's all bad.After replacing Richard Donner on directing duties during ""Superman 2"" Richard Lester is given full control this time around and boy does it show. The movie is a bit of a misconception, it's more of a Richard Pryor comedy that featured Superman than an actual Superman movie. All the worst elements that Lester added to ""Superman 2"" are back, all the slapstick comedy and lots of plugs for KFC again too.The problems start from the off, we get a Richard Pryor sketch that features him being refused his benefits and then the credits start. It's no longer in space and instead we get a series of comedy sketches that show men literally falling over themselves ogling Pamela Stephenson. And making matters worse Ken Thorne has replaced the brilliant John Williams. We do see Superman briefly when he saves a guy following a botched robbery. A lot of the dialogue is often cringeworthy (calling Metropolis ""The Big Apricot"" is dire"") and Robert Vaughn is a weak bad guy. AThere are some things to enjoy here, Reeve as always is brilliant, Anette O'Toole is effective as Lana Lang, the ending is enjoyable, and the video game is fun whilst the fire at the chemical plant and the junk yard fight between Superman and Clark Kent are the two obvious highlights of the movie for this reviewer.",Superman III
37,Movie Nuttball,A good sequel to Superman!,8,9 September 2002,"Superman III is good but very different. As always Christopher Reeves is great in this as the Man Of Steel.The story is good but I would have stuck with big bad villains instead of what the film is about. This is my least favorite film of the series but its a good film,it just doesn't match up to the two previous movies of Superman!",Superman III
38,zkonedog,How Terrible Is This Film? Let Me Count The Ways...,1,11 March 2017,"Despite the directorial struggles that plagued the simultaneous shooting of Superman I and II (Richard Donner being ousted in favor of Richard Lester), the films did very well financially, prompting a third effort. However, instead of the epic feel and formula of the first two films, this one falls completely flat for numerous reasons:-First, the direction of Lester. After watching this film, I am now convinced that Richard Donner really was the mastermind behind the success of the Superman film franchise, as Lester's ""Superman III"" is riddled with stupid humor and sight gags that do nothing to enhance the film viewing experience. Ironically enough, Donner was supposedly booted from the director's seat of Superman II due to too much farcical humor, but Lester is much worse in that department in this film.-The actors also seem to be sleep-walking through their roles, or were completely miscast in the first place. The new villain is wooden and doesn't hold a candle to Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor, while Richard Pryor's ""funny"" antics only make the whole film seem like a farce. Even Christopher Reeve, the centerpiece of the Superman franchise, turns in a sub-par performance both as the ""heroic"" and ""bad"" Superman. Not until the last few moments of the film does he seem to snap out of his acting doldrums and become the heroic character I remembered from the first two films.-The special effects are also a big step down from the previous efforts. At one point, the wires holding Reeve in the air can be clearly seen, while Superman's landings at times are not as smooth as they were in the earlier films. Once again, in this area ""Superman III"" could not recapture the greatest of the majestic special effects of the first two movies.-Finally, the two main plots in the film fall as flat as the acting, casting, and special effects. The ""bad Supes"" thread could have been done much more effectively (think of the good Kirk/bad Kirk in the old Star Trek: Original Series), and the same can be said for the ""supercomputer"" angle (Captain Kirk talking a computer into submission is much more compelling by comparison).Sadly, then, this film fails in nearly ever aspect of filmmaking. Instead of sticking with the lofty ideals and walking the fine line between heroic and cheesy that Donner did in the first two films, Lester tried to make a campier version of Superman and failed miserably. The only reason I would ""recommend"" this film to anyone is to show them how horribly wrong a film franchise can turn. Hard-core Supes fans will watch this film regardless of what I say, but to the casual fan I say that you can EASILY skip these two hours of boredom and not miss a beat in your Superman viewing experience.",Superman III
39,filipemanuelneto,Superman reaches his lowest point.,2,11 November 2021,"After seeing ""Superman II"", I thought the franchise couldn't get any worse... I was wrong. Despite retaining some small merits, this film is far worse and really shouldn't have been missed by those involved, especially Christopher Reeve. In fact, the actor even considered not acting in the film, and his participation was only guaranteed at the last minute, as I found out after some reading, which I did after seeing the film.For me, this movie has the worst script conception I've seen, within the Superman movies. In practice, it is a duel between the hero and a wealthy villain, called Webster. Initially, he wants to ward off competition from Colombian coffee by influencing the region's climate through a satellite, commanded by him thanks to a hacker he discovered in his own companies. When the superhero ruins his plans, he starts chasing him to kill him and get out of his way. Amidst this, the hero still has time to go to an alumni meeting of his old high school, where he meets an old flame, the former prom queen, Lana.The franchise lost its footing after the departure of Richard Donner, and there is nothing that can save the film from being considered terribly bad. The plot is surreal because it is so bad, unrealistic and false. The hero, until now seen as a well of integrity, and in theory in love with Lois Lane (who in this film virtually disappears), is almost put in the bed of two other women, in what we might consider a huge moral flaw. I could give lots of examples of other situations and moments without logic or meaning, but it would be redundant.Reeve does what he can in the role of Superman, but the actor made little effort, he wasn't really in the project with body and soul and his performance reflects that lack of will to be there. It sticks to the basics and doesn't shine. Annette O'Toole also manages to honor the basics, but she can't give us much more. Richard Pryor is moderately funny, but barely succeeds at making us laugh. Jackie Cooper and Robert Vaughan also don't bring any spark or charisma to the film. Pamela Stephenson is irritating, and Margot Kidder was almost relegated to the trailer, as she only appears for about five minutes.Technically, the film has some (few) redeeming virtues, such as the rather well-conceived cinematography, the satisfactorily conducted editing, and the light, relatively fast pace of the film, which avoids tiring the audience with an excessively long duration. Also, the soundtrack did reasonably well, even though the most famous pieces of music I've heard are pretty much the same as in every Superman movie. There are also one or two scenes worthy of anthology for their impact and notoriety, such as the fight between Superman's ego and alter-ego. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't go much further: the sets aren't very well done, there are a lot of cheap and unbelievable visuals and specials, and the movie generally looks cheaper and more fake than its predecessors.",Superman III
40,leplatypus,Not a super-script but a super-movie anyway (dad),10,14 October 2017,"Maybe at its release, the movie didn't seem good: indeed, the story is so ridiculous and repetitive from the 1st movie than we can be disappointed (thus Donner was right when he wanted rewrites from this same team!) However, today, it has become really good: first of all, I don't know any funny guy in the new generation and this late Richard Pryor at last makes me laugh! He is maybe a clone of Eddie Murphy but their wit and tongue were cool and not dirty! Next, the movie happens at the start of the computer era: now it's funny to discover the look of the elders and the naive way they were considered (change climate, drive boats, living organism). Here, the capacities are so unbelievable and geek (the computer game against Supe) that it ends funny! Next, if I missed badly Lois, at least Christopher proved one more time how he was talented and I really like the different attitudes he shows His return to Smallville and the introduction of Lana is interesting to the myth. At last, it's a American movie that feels good: the violence is very light and all the family can watch the movie; you see American people working, meeting together to have fun so it's very different of today productions when we wonder when people earns their life and it was a world free of digital relationships! In addition, all along the movie, there is moments when the movie goes totally nuts (the beginning, the electronic jam) and thus, this simple, cheaper candid America was really enjoyable to come back today!",Superman III

43,gwnightscream,"""Ok, But Could've Been Better!""",4,22 June 2012,"Christopher Reeve, Richard Pryor, Robert Vaughn, Annette O'Toole and Margot Kidder star in this 1983 action sequel. In this sequel, Clark Kent/Superman (Reeve) reunites with his Smallville high school crush, Lana Lang (O'Toole) and deals with ruthless wealthy businessman, Ross Webster (Vaughn). Pryor plays Gus Gorman, a computer expert who works for Webster and is persuaded by him to build a super computer to harm the Man of Steel. He starts by making synthetic Kryptonite laced with tobacco tar which makes Superman bad. Soon, Clark/Superman fights his evil alter ego and faces Webster. This sequel is OK, but could've been better. I think one of the problems is it focused too much on Pryor. Vaughn isn't bad as Webster, but I missed Lex Luthor and Kidder isn't in this long as Lois Lane. O'Toole is great as usual and the bad Superman thing is kind of good. I still recommend this.",Superman III
44,FiendishDramaturgy,It's better than the other 2!!,9,24 October 2003,"I adore Richard Pryor. While I'm not as fond of his raunchier performances, he is very endearing, otherwise, and this movie is no exception. While some have expressed dismay at his participation in this endeavor, I found his performance very refreshing as the comedic involvement, rather than Ned Beaty's whiny, unintelligible gibberings. The plot is much better than the first two installments, and actually raises this endeavor above the originals.Also, the part of Jimmy Olsen was expanded, giving Marc McClure a chance to better demonstrate his talents. Unfortunately, no one seemed to be noticing, as his movie credits are few and the parts rather obscure. And while Annette O'Toole's list of credits is much longer, her career has also been riddled with obscure, little-known parts. That is truly unfortunate, as she is a very talented and much under-rated actress. You may remember her from Stephen King's TV movie ""IT;"" she portrayed the adult character of Beverly Marsh. While this is by far my favorite of the ""Superman"" series, I am of a split mind about this movie in that the idea of a ""bad"" Superman just does not ""do it"" for me.Premise: The bad guy has created a synthetic form of kryptonite, but has replaced the ""unknown"" element in the chemical make-up with tobacco tar. Okay, fine. Tobacco's bad. Got it. But it causes a ""split"" between the Lighter side of Kent and the Dark half/Steely side of Superman and the steely side has no conscience, morals, nor empathy for anyone but himself. I found that whole episode to be rather distasteful. Yes, I understand the situation is a metaphor for the blackness/sickness of cancer caused by tobacco, but it was still distasteful, and I was very unhappy with the whole idea.But in support of the premise, it was not exactly the fake kryptonite which split him into two distinct halves. It changed him, but it was not what divided him. That, too was a metaphor for the battle raging inside him; his better side trying to ""exorcise"" the evil side brought to light by the kryptonite. Quite intelligent, actually. I just hated seeing Christopher Reeve's character being drug through the mud like that. Aaaaand, the battle between the two was quite lame, but effective in ridding him of the dark half of himself.Meanwhile, Gus (Pryor) and the bad guy are creating a super computer in order to better utilize Gus's computer skills, to assure Ross Webster's (the bad guy's-Robert Vaughn's) success in his financial domination of the world. What? You didn't expect a world domination ploy? It's Superman! Of course there is a world domination ploy!""Why, the same thing we do every day, Pinky! Try to take over the world!"" the Brain.I even loved the ""Demon Seed"" homage factor towards the end of the movie involving Webster's sister. Absolutely wonderful. The effects of this production are at least decent enough. This movie is a fun movie. Take off your thinking cap and just enjoy it.Fortunately, the evil twin part is over soon enough, and there are enough of the better parts of the movie to lift it above the sub-plot; ie: Reeve, Kidder, and Pryor. In my opinion, this was the best Superman yet, for the inclusion of Richard Pryor! I didn't get enough of Margot, though. But in all fairness, she was also filming ""Trenchcoat"" and ""Pygmalion"" at the same time. There just was not enough of her to go around, it seems. Luckily, she is back full steam in Superman IV, and is one of the few bright spots in that installment of this series.It rates a 9.0/10 from...the Fiend :.",Superman III
45,freemantle_uk,The comedic adventures of Superman,5,13 February 2021,"Superman III was the Superman remembered being on the most when I was a kid and looking back at it as an adult it was a hot mess. This film threw lots of ideas onto the screen without much focus on any of them, Richard Lester turned the story into more of a broad and slapstick comedy, and Richard Pryor had lot of free reign to ad-lib. There were some good set pieces like when Superman saved the Chemical Plant and Robert Vaughn's Lex Luthor stand in felt more of threat then Gene Hackman ever was. Despite the issues Christopher Reeve was at his best playing the titular character, especially when Superman turned to the dark side and both sides of his ego had to fight each other.",Superman III

Superman has long had a cheesy side to him, it's no secret, but in trying to uber-emphasize that aspect of the character above all else, this stretches itself way, way too thin. If one were to remove the rich, interesting back-story from the first two films, cram every forced, campy slapstick pun into one long reel and inexplicably insert Richard Pryor at his mainstream worst, the final product would look startlingly similar to Superman III. The shameless Luthor stand-in's villainous plot is vacant and nonsensical, Lois Lane is written out after twelve lines, The Man of Steel himself is basically a supporting character, and both the central plot vehicle and the final battle are so far over the top they've lost sight of the Earth. The Superman-gone-bad scenes are good for a laugh, if just in a ""wow, they actually filmed and released this"" manner, but otherwise it's catastrophic, toilet bowl stinker.",Superman III
47,MaxBorg89,Is this actually a Superman movie?,6,21 July 2006,"After two excellent Superman films, the franchise deteriorated. Superman IV (1987) was awful, but this third outing from 1983 isn't that great either.The main problem lies in the fact that the director, Richard Lester, sees the movie as a comedy, and therefore tries to make it as funny as possible. Proof? He cast Richard Pryor as Gus Gorman, a dishonest worker who teams up with Robert Vaughn's Luthor copycat, Ross Webster, to dominate the world through a computer. But first they need to get rid of Superman (Christopher Reeve), who's visiting his childhood town Smallville and reuniting (under his Clark Kent identity) with old friends, particularly Lana Lang (Annette O'Toole, currently playing Supes'mom in the Smallville TV series).Their ""lethal"" weapon? Synthetic kryptonite which splits our hero in two, Good Superman vs. Evil Superman.Now, this movie has its good moments: the two Supermen fighting each other is an awesome sequence, and Reeve (who finally received top billing in the credits) is as good as ever. However, the rest is a mess: Lois Lane is quickly sidelined (due to an argument between actress Margot Kidder and the movie's producers), and 90% of the script is based on utterly silly set-pieces involving Richard Pryor, who could have been a good villain hadn't his dialogue been so dire. Vaughn, on the other hand, does a good job, but it's kind of obvious he can't successfully replace Gene Hackman as a power-obsessed millionaire.All in all, Superman III is watchable (once or twice), but it's absolutely not what a Superman film should be like. It sort of looks like a Supes version of the '60s Batman show (the one with Adam West), and that's not an entirely good thing.5,5/10",Superman III
48,iquine,Superman Battles Himself,4,17 July 2017,(Flash Review)I don't understand the script decisions made in this movie. Lois Lane is literally on vacation the whole film and Clark and some new secretary gal from his hometown get cozy together. What happened with the charming romance between Clark and Lois from the last movie?!?! Richard Pryor's character was comic relief but never made me chuckle and he is also a computer geek that the villain uses to stop Superman. And that villain is the most forgettable character in memory. Pryor was on screen much more yet it was oddly funnier to watch Superman drinking at a bar and spoiling the Olympic torch lighting. Superman gets hampered by a manufactured piece of Kryptonite and has a very interesting battle as this isn't typical Kryptonite. The movie had some OK effects but the tone and script missed the mark for me in comparison with the first two.,Superman III
49,drystyx,"Yes, this was pretty dull for a Superman movie",3,30 January 2011,"It's really too bad. There were a lot of talented actors from top to bottom in this, but the writing was an atrocity.One imagines most reviews of this movie will begin with the overused phrase ""The trouble with this is..."" But here the phrase fits.The movie strives for humor way too much. And from top to bottom, the abilities of the performers was there for humor, but the trouble here is in the writing.We begin with a very ridiculous street scene, written to showcase performers, but horribly written. There is no purpose, and there is no freshness. It is completely flat. It would've been flat in 1935.The production crew tried too hard to make this a comic effort. There was a little bit of the old time home town charm of Superman, but it wasn't captured hard enough. It's as though director and staff couldn't agree on what to make of the movie, and it became a muddled mess.The worship of blonde women by men makes one wonder if the Nazi party funded this movie. It's one of those myths that women want to be true, but sorry, it isn't. It was goofy when the opening scene had men agape at a blonde woman and totally ignoring a super hot brunette on skates. Wishful thinking by women. It looks phony to men. Obviously, the women involved had the biggest say in how this movie was made.The comic book appeal is lacking, too. It isn't important that the Eiffel Tower looks like a drawing. No one cares about that. What is important is that the atmosphere isn't there. There is no warmth, nor is there any style. The humor isn't natural. Neither is the action. The lack of style and atmosphere is what truly brings this movie down. There is no atmosphere at all. It is too cold for Smallville, too urban for comic book appeal.This was a disaster on the drawing board. It wasn't the worst movie ever made. It was just a disappointing movie.",Superman III

53,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,"Is by far less enjoyable than Superman (1978) and Superman II (1980), but also isn't that bad either",6,18 June 2015,"After witnessing unknown actor Christopher Reeve successfully fill the enormous shoes of Superman in Superman (1978) and then do it again in Superman II (1980), it would seem doing it a third time would be no problem. The question however, that many fans of the first two films can't seem to get a clear answer to, is why was this the turning point for everything else? For most, this entry would mark the point where fans became baffled and disappointed with the lack of care that went into later Superman productions. It's not to say that this film is awful, no it's not unwatchable. However for those who loved how the first two movies complimented each other, this time the experience will feel quite different. After defeating Lex Luthor with Zod & Co. in Superman II (1980), Clark Kent / Superman (Christopher Reeve) runs into his next villain who looks to control the world via global satellite.This greedy manipulator known as Ross Webster and his sister Vera are played by Robert Vaughn and Annie Ross respectively. There they convince a self-discovered computer whiz named August Gorman (Richard Pryor) to help them acquire their demands by hacking into a global satellite to control the weather. This plot isn't exactly plausible in any respect but, to at least enjoy the positives of this entry, the concept of belief can be suspended (mostly). Unfortunately what really hurts this installment is its writing, which shockingly is written by the same duo (Leslie & David Newman) that penned the first two movies. One big change that is strongly noticeable is its tone. This might be due to director Richard Lester who worked on more comedies than anything else. But here, the comedic bits feel weird, forced and sometimes out of place. This is more for the last half of the running time. There's also a very abrupt change in genre for a small time too. It feels like a totally different movie.An example of this is always happening when Clark Kent is talking with an old school friend named Lana Lang (Annette O'Toole). Every time they exchange lines, one's asking about one thing while the other answers that question but is talking about something else. It's always a conversation where one ends up getting confused about who's talking about what. Along with that are unexplained problems and resolutions to those problems. When something occurs and people make assumptions about it without any proof, then it's not credible. So how does an audience accept that if the characters themselves don't even truly know? You can't really, that's the whole point. The other component that did not fit this entry were the villains. For one thing, Richard Pryor as a sniveling computer hack was not convincing or funny. He was just obnoxious. Even more annoying however was Ross Webster, Vera and some other female that hung around them named Lorelei (Pamela Stephenson). Stephenson was absolutely useless.Be that as it may, these parts don't drag down the whole movie entirely. Aside from the writing, the rest of the parts that make up a movie remain well put together. Although the last half of the film feels odd, the first half however reminisces more of the traditional tone. That means more of what everyone was originally used to with scenes like Daily Planet with Perry White (Jackie Cooper), Jimmy Olsen (Marc McClure) and a cameo of Lois Lane (Margot Kidder). Even with Margot Kidder having a reduced role and Annette O'Toole taking her spot wasn't that disappointing. Lana Lang had a different backstory involving a drunk named Brad (Gavan O'Herlihy) who was once a football jock from Smallville. These relationships are acceptable and feel worthy of a subplot. Heck, even the infamous Good Vs Evil Superman subplot entertained at a decent level. Seeing an evil Superman was certainly something Reeve had never played before.Speaking of which, Christopher Reeve again verified to his fans in this film, that even with an uneven script he still can play the man of steel with ease. Reeve was undoubtedly still the best part. The cinematography provided by Robert Paynter, who also shot for Superman II (1980) maintained the ability to include great scanning POVs and capture unique set pieces. This blended nicely with the special effects as well, which also had practical areas included. And here I was thinking its effects budget wasn't going to be good for all the negative responses about it before viewing. I was impressed however. Finally for the music, although harder to find an actual copy, composer Ken Thorne returned to score the film. Just like before, Thorne held onto Superman's theme from the last two films and does include new tracks. These themes are mostly for evil Superman. If the script was handled better, it probably would've been easily another enjoyable follow-up. But the attention isn't there.For what people say for it to be, it isn't THAT bad. If you can suspend your belief, it will be easier to accept because half of it is decently written. It's just the other half involving its annoying antagonists and forced comedic tone that don't work. Its special effects, music, camera-work and cast of actors from the first two however still remain the best parts, especially Christopher Reeve.",Superman III

That movie didn't even come out in 1979 but was released overseas during the 1980 thanksgiving season before it was released to North America the following summer to big records and a huge hit directed by Lester, who took over for Donner when it ran over budget and Richard was fired (the donner cut came out in 2006 to better reception). He would go on to direct Superman III and cast Richard Pryor, known for comedy schlock, as second billing to Chistopher Reeve. It was a hit, but not the hit that WB needed during a year when its Atari division suffered losses after the failure of ET and the struggling Pirates of MLB. It was the third highest grossing film of the reeve era, but the second lowest grossing, as Superman IV was made on a cheaper budget and released by Cannon and became a super turd. 35 years later, Superman III feels more like a comedy than a serious movie, and it shows.",Superman III
55,lemon_magic,Stabs the franchise through the heart with badly misjudged change in tone and questionable casting,3,17 April 2005,"The opening sequence to the film, kind of a Rube-Goldberg type slapstick thing which ends with a man almost getting drowned in his car, is a dead giveaway to the audience that this film is not going to be in the same league as the first two Supermans. It's supposed to be funny, but it just clunks along like a tank with lead caterpillar treads, and it goes nowhere fast. Apparently Lester and the Salkinds really didn't understand how slapstick stunts work, and they should have been locked in a room with a copy of ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" until they got it right.The movie does pick up a little bit from there, and there are a few good bits that save it from being utter crap: the fight between 'good' and 'bad' Superman in the junkyard, with its denouement where Clark undoes his shirt to reveal the original hue of the costume, is quite nice. Some of the moments with Annette O'Toole as Lana Lang are decent, too - I'm not her biggest fan, but she suits the role of the small town girl that Clark left behind and fleshes it out well.Everything else until the very end is, well, bad. Going from Terence Stamp and Gene Hackman to people like Robert Vaughn and Richard Pryor is a terrible, terrible decision and completely undercuts any sense of real portent or menace that a decent villain is meant to have in a film like this. You can't believe for a moment that Vaughn's lightweight character and his nitwit entourage would be any kind of match for the Man Of Steel, and Pryor's role, even as an innocent dupe, just isn't what this film needs - he is completely out of place here. Give me the Pryor from ""BiCentennial ******"" instead; THAT character belongs in a Superman film. There is just a bit of style and flair in the final showdown scene with the Super Computer where the villains are transformed into nightmarish robot slaves and then Superman is lashed repeatedly with huge energy bolts and pulled helplessly inside the guts of the computer - you actually get a sense of conflict and drama, and the clever way Supes saves the day by using his smarts and cunning almost saves the film.But it's not enough. 75% of the film has the same problems as the opening sequence - it just doesn't work or hold together. Unlike the first two films, the stuff that is supposed to be funny simply isn't, and most of the stuff that is supposed to be dramatic is spoiled by bad timing or misjudged performances that ruin any sense of involvement in the film.Rent the tape or DVD once so you can fast-forward to one or two of the scenes with O'Toole, the fight in the junkyard, and the fight with the Super Computer.

The latter film doesn't have much in its favour. Robert Vaughn - not a bad actor - was the wrong choice for the role of main villain. Where was Gene Hackman when he was needed? There was too much emphasis on Richard Pryor (he looks as high as Superman whilst in flight most of the time) and the humour was largely misplaced.
The one scene that works from beginning to end, is when Superman engages in a one-on-one battle with his evil alter ego. I thoroughly enjoyed watching them duking it out. A bonus that the fight sequence was filmed in London!
The climax is so bloody stupid! Superman coming up against a sophisticated computer! I ask you, why couldn't the writers have been a bit more imaginative??

Probably the best idea in the movie and indeed the most entertaining was the development of the ""evil"" superman. The junkyard scene was easily the most memorable as Reeves shines and pretty much holds down the movie from completely sinking. Alas that whole subplot only lasted a scant 30 min or so of the movie's runtime. Richard Pryor creates a few scenes worthy of a chuckle, but along with the clunky story, the film is badly devoid of a villain. The 2 sisters and Robert Vaughn seem poorly inadequate.

58,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,What a downer.,3,6 April 2016,"Richard Lestet returned for another pay cheque film, upping the slapstick, and lessening nearly everything else.The production design is good, the cinematography and acting is good, Christopher Reeve is in top form, as usual, this time in three roles: Clark Kent, Superman, and Evil Superman, and he pulls off all of them quite well. As far as the villain goes, we go from excellent General Zod and his goons in Part II to Robert Vaughn playing Robert Vaughn, and Richard Pryor, who looks either unsure of what he is doing here, or just bored to be here, as he is forced to create synthetic Kryptonite by Lex Luthor's replacement, Robert Vaughn, to try to kill Superman.The film seems unsure what it wants to be, as it veers wildly from zany slapstick, to dark scifi, and action, to horror, as Vera's transformation scene is creepy as hell, and I don't mean that in a good way. The fantasy of the first two films has been replaced with completely out of place horror elements at the climax, which makes it a downer, followed by more silly slapstick in its closing moments, to try to raise the audiences' spirits, unsuccessfully.",Superman III
59,brando647,Superman vs. the Evils of Technology: Or How I Learned to Conquer the World from a Computer in a Wheat Harvesting Co.,5,16 August 2013,"I am no more than a casual fan of the original Christopher Reeve SUPERMAN films. I appreciate the films for what they are but, having been raised in an era where CGI was constantly improving and cynicism became prevalent, I'm not as amazed by the dated effects or as drawn in to the gee-whiz mentality of the films' whimsical natures. Still, SUPERMAN and it's sequel (well, primarily the Donner-directed version) were pretty good movies. But by the third film, any element of Richard Donner's involvement had faded and we were left with a total Richard Lester goofball-fest with a ridiculous script from David and Leslie Newman. The series takes a definitive turn here, dropping any fantastic action/adventure vibes for a more comedic approach that vaguely reminds me of the Adam West/Batman television series from the '60s. In SUPERMAN III, the hero faces his more heinous villain yet: technology! Cue the dramatic music. I suppose there must have been some sort of technophobe phase in the early '80s and the filmmakers were attempting to tap into that vein with Superman versus a self-aware super-computer. Gus Gorman (Richard Pryor) is a perpetually unemployed loser who discovers one afternoon that he's a computer genius and had never realized it before. His talents come to the attention of evil business mogul Ross Webster (Robert Vaughn) and his sister Vera (Annie Ross). Gorman's skills are employed in hacking into satellites to manipulate weather and, ultimately, the world before eventually constructing a massive computer designed to accomplish the impossible: kill Superman.There might be a fun superhero movie in there somewhere. Maybe. In the hands of Richard Lester, we get a campy adventure filled with sight gags and cheese performances. You know we're in for a rough ride when the opening credits, once presented to the score of John Williams over a field of stars, now come at you in a weird blur over a series of slapstick gags in the streets of Metropolis. Imagine the scene in SUPERMAN II where the villain uses his super-breath to create a bunch of jokes with people being blown around in bizarre scenarios, but expanded to fill a two-hour film. That is SUPERMAN III. Most of the goofiness comes from Richard Pryor and his bumbling Gus Gorman. Pryor is a funny dude and all, but I just don't see how they ever expected his brand of humor to fit into a proper Superman movie. Or maybe it wasn't so much that Pryor didn't fit. After all, we had Gene Hackman's eccentric performances as Lex Luthor and*sigh*Ned Beatty as Otis in the first two films. The problem is that the comedy is the focus of the movie. Pryor's antics are just the tip of the iceberg. At one point in the movie, Superman is corrupted by some impure kryptonite and becomes evil. His evil agenda: practical jokes such as straightening the leaning tower of Pisa and blowing out the Olympic torch. If the movie had taken itself a little more seriously and not embraced the ""comic"" in comic book, the movie might've been a little stronger. Well, except foryou knowthe stupid.Seriously, this movie is stupid. There have been countless articles about how Hollywood just doesn't understand technology and SUPERMAN III is the epitome of it all. To start, there's the laughable thought that average unemployed bum Gorman can sit in front of a computer and suddenly program at a genius level without any prior experience/trainingto his own surprise as much as the audience's. Then we're expected to believe Gorman can hack into a satellite and use it to control the weather. Why? Because it's a COMPUTER! Duh! Computers can do anything! The same satellite is later used to locate Krypton's remains and scan the debris for its elemental structure from light years awaybecause COMPUTERS! The whole thing really is so unbelievably stupid that it's hilarious. And this is why I can't outright hate this movie, even if it deserves it. It's so dumb that it sort of redeems itself. What it lacks in action/adventure or fantasy, it makes up for in full-on stupid and I laugh just enough that I can't come down on it too hard. If the movie didn't try too hard to find a sensitive side with a side plot involving Clark Kent finding love with high school sweetheart Lana Lang (Annette O'Toole) in Smallville and bog the movie down in the mid-section, I'd enjoy SUPERMAN III even more. It's so off-kilter that it almost works as a parody of the franchise itself.So I guess, on some level, SUPERMAN III almost works. 'Almost' being the operative word. In no sense does it actually work as the next chapter in the Superman saga started by Richard Donner with the original two far superior films, but it can still be good for some laughs, whether they be intentional (from Lester's comic leanings) or unintentional (the evils of technology!). In the end, it all sort of balances out to a tolerable medium and a less disappointing stain on the Man of Steel than the final nail in the coffin that would come four years later: SUPERMAN IV.",Superman III

61,mike48128,A Strange Movie: Great yet Stupid,8,4 May 2013,"Why an 8? Because ""Superman IV"" is so bad. That film looks half-finished and has plot-holes you can drive a bus through. (You can't cut Superman's hair and humans can't breathe in space.) So on to what's wrong and right about III: Director Richard Lester basically filmed a comic book adventure of Superman. The comedy is too broad here, and Richard Pryor (Gus) plays it way over the top. A bumbling fool as a software genius? British spelling and ""received"" spelled wrong? ""The St. Louis Bar"" is obviously in Canada-It's a ""licensed"" tavern. Designing a super-computer by doodling on matchbook covers? What's with ""Gus"" wearing that giant cowboy hat at the computer terminal in Smallville? All the alcohol, tobacco and fast-food plugs? Handing Superman a trophy that looks exactly like a Kryptonite chunk? Touches on a lot of good themes that should have been handled better: A ""Jekyll and Hyde"" Superman. Nothing original: Renegade computers and satellites trying to take over the world. It's been done before. Robert Vaughn is so terrible as the villain. His evil ugly sister changed into a rampaging cyborg? Good idea, bad execution. I bet this all looked great on paper. The sets just don't seem to work, too elaborate or too cheap-looking. Too many British accents including Lana Lang's son! So was Clark engaged to Lana Lang? We will never know, will we? I wish I could recut this film and shorten a few scenes, so it didn't come across as such a silly comedy. This will forever be known as the movie that almost ""killed"" Superman's ""career"". I can't explain why it is still fun to watch, in spite of all it's faults. Annette O'Toole and Reeve give good performances in an otherwise bad movie with good intentions. If not for the better ""sequels"" such as ""Lois and Clark"" and ""Smallville"" poor Superman would have been gone forever, after this film.",Superman III
62,dunmore_ego,The Last Gasp of the Last Son of Krypton.,3,8 August 2011,"It's a Richard Pryor movie starring Superman. No, it's a Superman movie starring Richard Pryor. Whatever it is, no one's taking SUPERMAN III seriously.Richard Pryor's performance is the only credible meat in this debacle, which features the relatively new concept of ""computers"" being utilized for eeeevil, and with a subplot of Superman affected by hybrid kryptonite which doesn't kill him but makes him do really bad things like get drunk and flick peanuts at mirrors. (See what I mean about taking it seriously?) Though Pryor is surrounded by now-veteran SUPERMAN co-stars, Doug McClure (as Jimmy Olsen), Margot Kidder (as Lois Lane), Jackie Cooper (as Perry White) and A-Listers Robert Vaughn (as the villain) and talented comedienne Pamela Stephenson (as the villain's T&A, who does nothing more than minimally expose her T&A), he alone saves the movie from descending to the Ninth Level of Hell with his inimitable patsy turn as a computer hacker hired by Vaughn for evil ends.Christopher Reeve is once again the Man of Steel and is given such an abominable script to work with - coupled with the worst and cheapest flying effects you will ever see - that wearing his neon blue and red duds out in public is starting to look exceptionally gay.Gone is the slick production value; gone is the tagline ""You'll believe a man can fly"" because when you watch SUPERMAN III, you're pretty sure a man can't fly and that he's being levitated by guy wires attached to a crane. Gone is the majestic music - Ken Thorne is only allowed minimal snatches of John Williams's grand theme, the rest of the soundtrack consisting of slapstick toodles to accompany director Richard Lester's supposedly uproarious slapstick action. To call the opening credit sequence a third grader's idea of comedy is a compliment.The references to ""computers"" (in their boxy housings with big qwerty keyboards and green text on black screens) will look especially dated to youngsters; the acting will make you want to kill your pet, the audio looping will make you want to slap your child, and when Superman ""goes bad"" we see that his idea of badness is as juvenile as his idea of goodness...I've said this before: with the powers that Superman possesses, he shouldn't even THINK about ""bank robbers"" or ""people falling down and hurting themselves"" - this guy should be dealing with crime at the highest corporate levels, the ""white collar"" crime that CREATES low level crime by creating economic social rifts.But who is really paying attention when his undies are so bright and tight? By the mid-1980s, Superman comicbooks had been developing story lines and character over 50 years - yet this third modern SUPERMAN movie still retains the provincial mentality of the 1950s.Superman is handed pseudo-kryptonite by Richard Pryor (doing his best General Patton - one of the films three great laughs) which doesn't kill him, but makes him do bad things: straightens out the Leaning Tower of Pisa, blows out the Olympic torch, punctures an oil tanker, and gets drunk. You know, true evil. Oh, and he almost grows a three-day shadow, the universal stamp of sexy Euro villains. And when he has the opportunity to slam Pamela Stephenson atop the Statue of Liberty, he accedes to doing her a favor first in return for her sexual favors! Yeah, badness like Mister Rogers.It takes an hour for the film to reach this semi-interesting point - and then it goes nowhere with the concept. Superman merely splits into two people - himself and Clark Kent - and battles soporifically with himself in a junkyard, raising the film almost to the level of boring. Clark Kent triumphs. Hooray for dorks! Another subplot involves Clark Kent returning to Smallville for a school reunion and hitting the picnic blanket hard with Lana Lang (Annette O'Toole) and her son. A plot strand - like the factory fire or the dual personality bit or the fat couple vacationing in South America - that goes nowhere at super speed.One would think that director Richard Lester, after making such a hash of SUPERMAN 2, would have been issued a restraining order against any Superman product. Instead, producer Alexander Salkind re-hires the insipid comedy director to make a hash of SUPERMAN III as well.And Lester succeeds beyond anyone's wildest expectations.",Superman III
63,Maciste_Brother,As bad as a movie can get,1,30 March 2004,"This Superman movie, along with the following sequel, is one of the sorriest excuses for a movie ever conceived by producers. The whole thing just reeks. It's as bad as a movie can get. And the folks responsible for this sloppy, junky, stupid movie clearly had no respect for moviegoers. It's a total embarrassment for everyone involved. It seems that they tried to go in the BATMAN TV series route (notice how the super computer in SUPERMAN III looks like the Batcave in the TV series) but at least the TV show, as cheesy as it was, was fun to watch. This is just painful from beginning to end.Avoid at all cost!!!!",Superman III
64,brchthethird,"Special effects as good as ever; the story, not so much",5,11 June 2015,"Despite this being my first time going through the Christopher Reeve Superman movies, I am keenly aware of the general public attitude toward them. So, I knowingly lowered my expectations for this third entry in the series. Even with those lowered expectations, I still wasn't prepared for how insipidly stupid it would be. Yes, there was plenty of Superman action. Yes, the special effects were as good as ever. The acting was fine. But the story? Oh my god! Richard Lester was merely a hired gun on SUPERMAN II, due to Richard Donner being fired. Here he was in charge the whole time, and the sillier aspects of that film were given too much free reign here.The plot this time around is certainly one of the weakest aspects of the whole film. In short, an evil corporation that has ambitions for economic domination taints Superman with synthetic kryptonite (laced with tobacco tar), and this splits him into evil Superman and good Clark Kent. All of the best parts of the first two films are either shoved to the side or left out entirely. This means hardly any Daily Planet, and Lex Luthor is nowhere to be found. The replacement just doesn't compare favorably, no matter how much I didn't like Lex Luthor's characterization before. That being said, Superman having an identity crisis was an intriguing idea, but the way it's executed is so hamfistedly literal that it kills whatever impact it could have had.However, in the interest of not coming off like I absolutely hated the film, I will say that the technical aspects of the film were really good. All of the special effects were handled well, and the flying sequences were deftly handled, even if it's fairly apparent now how they were achieved (front projection). I also thought the cinematography was excellent, with a number of beautiful shots of landscapes and scenery. As previously stated, the acting was fine. In the TV special on the making of SUPERMAN II, Christpher Reeve talked about how he preferred playing Clark Kent because he was more relatable as a person. Here, the plot allowed for him to explore a darker side to Superman's personality, which I'm certain he had a hand in seeing as he's the film's star and it probably gets tiresome playing the same character over and over again. That one aspect of the plot is something I'll give the writers kudos for. If only they (and the director) hadn't made the film so silly...What's wrong with the film is nearly everything else. Richard Pryor plays an opportunistic con man and computer genius (who discovers his talent in a computer programming course). There is absolutely nothing wrong with Richard Pryor. I quite like his standup act. However, he seemed extremely out of place here. In general, the silly tone just rubbed me the wrong way and there was too much reliance on slapstick for laughs. A perfect example of this is the opening scene which just went on far too long. At some point, it felt like I was watching a Keystone Kops movie than a Superman film. Beyond that, some elements of the story were nonsensical and just plain stupid. First of all, is this the same Clark Kent/Superman who reversed time to save Lois Lane and gave up his power to be with her (temporarily, at least)? If so, then why does he go back to Smallville and almost immediately hook up with childhood friend Lana Lang? Also, compared to the villains' schemes in the previous two films, the plot to turn Superman into a jerk (so that they can dominate the coffee industry?) seems like a step back. Not only that, but they bungle the one clever plot element by having Superman literally fight Clark Kent, and then having the ""evil"" side just disappear when Clark Kent puts a choke hold on him. And when you think about it, kryptonite is pretty stupid as it is. I could go on, but hopefully I've made my point.Overall, SUPERMAN III feels like a huge step back in storytelling when compared to the previous two, which I didn't exactly love to begin with. Entertaining? Yes, in some respects, but this one was borderline painful to watch. The idiocy displayed on screen was barely tolerable. Richard Lester was allowed to indulge in his slapstick tendencies to a degree which wasn't possible in SUPERMAN II (since he had to use stuff that Richard Donner shot), and the result was rather unflattering. Having watched nine of the original Superman cartoon shorts, at times this felt like a return to that style, which I was not a fan of. I'll give the filmmakers credit for making a visually appealing film that displays some technical prowess. I also still get goosebumps when I hear John Williams' iconic theme. But literally everything else works against that to make an unfortunately sub-par film.",Superman III
65,sarastro7,Superman III is actually really good,9,10 January 2008,"I find it hard to explain that Superman III has such a bad rep. From the moment I originally saw it in the theater in 1983 or '84 at the age of 12 or 13, I loved it. During the 1990s, as far as I remember, I only watched it once, and wasn't too impressed with it, although I read the comic book adaption several times. Recently I developed a new interest in the Supes movies (largely due to the release, of course, of the Donner Cut of Superman II), and watched them all again, this time on DVD. And I was pretty blown away by all of the three first movies. Christopher Reeve is seminal, no, *epochal*, as Superman/Clark Kent!I don't see what's not to like about III. I have nothing against Pryor, nor the comedy (it reflects the comics well), and I think the 125 minutes are absolutely packed with good story and great adventure. There's so much going on here that one is pretty breathless at the end! The dark Superman and the whole fight between Supes and Clark was great stuff. I loved the Lana Lang subplot, I loved the super-computer, I loved Ross and Lorelei and even Vera - deliciously campy characters, depicted with the right amount of irony and parody. I Am Im-Pressed!Nay-sayers, begone! You wouldn't know quality if it took a big bite outta your butt!My ratings of the Superman movies:Superman I (2000 Expanded Edition): 8/10Superman II (2006 Donner Cut): 10/10Superman III: 9/10Superman IV: 5/10",Superman III
66,ODDBear,A lot less humor needed,6,16 October 2006,"If you're a fan of Superman you'll find plenty to enjoy in this third installment in the series. I do, but it must be admitted that this film is much inferior to the first two.This has Richard Lester written all over it. Superman II was Richard Donner's creation and Lester simply took over and wisely kept the tone of the film but with some added humor. This time around the humor steers the film as it's mostly a Richard Pryor vehicle. It doesn't come as much of a surprise that the film fares best when focusing on the Man of Steel, whether he's romancing an old flame in Smallville or in high flying action.This is also the film where Superman goes bad and fights his alter ego to the death. Those scenes are the best in the film. Some set pieces are pretty good and special effects are decent. However, the finale has to be deemed utterly ridiculous when Superman battles a ""sophisticated"" computer! Reeve is amazing as Superman/Clark Kent. Effortlessly switching to playing a meaner version of himself, he's simply perfect. Richard Pryor is always the same, so if you're a fan of his work you'll love him here. Everyone else is decent except those three villains; they're a little too much, especially Vaughn.A lot less humor and more seriousness would have made the film very good.",Superman III
67,Beta_Gallinger,"An inferior third installment with usually unfunny humour, though the film is definitely not as bad as I believed it would be",6,14 January 2011,"This is the third of the four ""Superman"" movies starring Christopher Reeve, in a role which the actor was very famous for. It was directed by Richard Lester, who also directed the final cut of ""Superman II"", and before seeing his contributions to this franchise, I saw ""A Hard Day's Night"" and ""Help!"", two 60's comedies which Lester also directed, starring the Beatles as themselves. Having seen the first two installments in the ""Superman"" franchise within the past few weeks and being impressed with both of them (though slightly more with the first one than the second, unsurprisingly), I intended to watch this one next, since I have been planning on watching them all. I was expecting ""Superman III"" to be far inferior to its two predecessors, as it was clearly much less popular, but to me, it seemed to be only slightly inferior.Gus Gorman is a man in Metropolis who can't seem to get a job and is informed that he is not eligible for unemployment. He then comes across a computer training ad and decides to enroll. His amazing computer skills catch the attention of Ross Webster, a wealthy businessman who intends to use Gus's skills to help him take over the world economy! Gus ends up joining the scheming businessman, his sister Vera, and assistant Lorelei Ambrosia in their evil plans! Superman/Clark Kent is unaware of this activity while he is away from the city and back in Smallville for a high school reunion. Ross forces Gorman to take control of a weather satellite and create a hurricane to destroy the coffee crop of Colombia, a country which has refused to do business with him! After Superman comes and stops this disaster, the evil businessman realizes he must kill the renowned hero in order for his schemes to work! Kryptonite is the only thing that can kill Superman, so Gus uses his computer skills to find the elements of the substance, and finds all but one. The kryptonite with one missing element replaced by tar does not kill Superman, but it does make him turn evil! The first segment of this second sequel shows Gus, played by groundbreaking comedian Richard Pryor, in the unemployment office. This part basically shows what the humour is like throughout the film, sometimes just a little funny, but not usually even that. This part is followed by the opening credits sequence, featuring a series of pointless and usually very straight-faced sight gags. This might be the worst attempt at humour in the entire movie, which is certainly saying something! For a long time, most of ""Superman III"" seemed basically mediocre to me. There are times early on when it does get intense, such as Superman trying to save a chemical plant from a fire, but the high school reunion and the scenes involving Clark Kent and Lana Lang reunited in Smallville usually didn't grab me. Also, Lorelei Ambrosia, played by Pamela Stephenson, is borderline annoying. However, during the second hour, it finally became clear to me that the movie was above average in my book, as it gets more exciting at this point, starting with the evil Superman and the good Clark Kent getting into a fight! I can understand why this third installment in the famous ""Superman"" film adaptation franchise is less popular than its two predecessors, due to the usually unsuccessful attempts at humour and maybe an inferior main villain, but after watching the whole film, I don't quite get what makes it a REALLY bad film to many people. It did look like I would by rating ""Superman III"" 5/10 for quite a while into it, but with the sequence showing Superman's fight with himself, I knew that I would not be able to rate the film any lower than 6/10, and what I saw after that didn't change my mind, even if it is a little overlong. It helps that Christopher Reeve's portrayal of the protagonist still has the same charm. Criticism for this particular installment in the franchise turned out to be very high, but it does seem to have a following, and it definitely turned out to be better than Joel Schumacher's contributions to the ""Batman"" movie franchise when he took over as the director for the third and fourth installments, so I won't call ""Superman III"" a must-see, but also won't urge people to avoid it at all costs.",Superman III
68,vip_ebriega,More comic-book than the first two.,5,14 February 2007,"My Take: It never reaches the heights of its predecessors with its sillier story and ridiculous villains. Many consider this a weak entry in the Superman film series. Well, I thought it was at first. But when I watched it in numerous reruns, I began to like this. Christopher Reeve excellently reprises his role, alongside comedy favorite Richard Pryor, as a computer-whiz, who is hired by his boss to help fulfill his plans for world domination. Pryor may not do it right sometimes, but he's admittedly hilarious in spots. But painfully ridiculous in some. Among the things that make it a bit unsatisfying for critics is the lack of the characters from the originals. Lois lane had to go on vacation, so Lana Lang (played well by Annette O'Toole)is Superman's/Clark Kent's love interest. Robert Vaughn plays a sinister mastermind, an okay replacement for the famous villain Lex Luther. What some viewers don't understand is that director Richard Lester wants it to be more of a comic book adventure rather than what scriptwriter Mario Puzo did in the first two.

69,fmarkland32,Man of steel justice..,6,30 June 2006,"This time the man of steel takes on a computer genius and due to kryptonite gelled with tar, makes Superman split in two personalities, good guy Clark Kent and bad guy Superman. Superman III's hands down highlight goes to the sequence where Superman fights Clark Kent, this sequence is amusing and fits with the overall comic-book feel. Aside from that however this movie is too silly and relies to heavily on comic set pieces, when Superman isn't a premise that needs to be done with much comedy. Still I did enjoy a lot of the movie and it's a perfect example of guilty pleasure, if there ever was one.* *1/2 out of 4-(Pretty good)",Superman III
70,ivo-cobra8,A very underreted solid decent third Superman sequel and that not a bad one,8,7 October 2016,"Superman III (1983) is very extremely underrated bashed hated film and I am going to defend this film today! It is one of my personal favorite Superman movies of all time. Yes you read the title I love Superman III it is my childhood movie, I grew up watching this film and it was the first film I saw as a kid. Since I saw half of the second film Richard Lester version. Christopher Reeve will always be Clark Kent Superman for me no one else can replace him I don't care what anyone says. I kept wining to my parents that I want to see Superman movie and in the video store a lady video store owner gave me Superman III on VHS when I was a kid and it was the only movie she had. Superman III is MILES way better than crappy lame Zack Snyder's Man of Steel and Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice I hate those movies. I find this film enjoyable, well-done, and extremely underrated. The effects & technology are extremely dated (especially the computers), but this is still a decent, well-done film. Plot: Synthetic kryptonite laced with tobacco tar splits Superman in two: good Clark Kent and bad Man of Steel. Thing's I love in this movie, why I gave the most highest rating in this film and why I am defending it:Christopher Reeve is and always will be the only SUPERMAN! No one could play Clark Kent/Superman like Christopher Reeve, If anyone could be Superman, It is Christopher Reeve! The opening sequence with the ""fools of Metropolis"" was amusing, in a slap-stick way; this intentionally reminded me of some of the old slap-stick routines from years before (Laurel & Hardy; Three Stooges; etc.). And, sure, a lot of Superman III was comedic, but a lot of this was just in line with the Gus Gorman (Richard Pryor) character. Superman/Clark going back to Smallville for his high school reunion & running into Lana Lang (Annette O'Toole), etc. Very cool sequence, and I liked seeing Superman return to his ""roots"". Also, based on the reunion you get an idea of the character's ages - i.e., the reunion said ""Class of 1965"" & since the film came out in 1983 (and supposedly was set in ""real time), then Clark & his class-mates were all around 36 years old at that point.This film focus more on Lana Lang, Clark's first love, Lois was Clark's eternal Love but Lana was his first love. Annette O'Toole was perfectly as Lana Lang after long 18 years Annette was cast as Martha Kent in Smallville. In Superman: The Movie Lana Lang was played by actress Diane Sherry and she only had a cameo scene and than she disappeared from the rest of the film. Here we find out more about Clark and Lana's love! I saw Clark and Lois in the first two films but now we see more Clark and Lana's love story. Superman save's Ricky (Paul Kaethler) Lana's son in the corn filed from the tractor that scene was really serious, the kid could have been seriously crushed, it that could have happened in real life. This film was filmed and released in year of 1983 the year that I was born. This was my first Superman movie and it is my childhood film, I love it to death and I will always cherished. The whole sequence where Superman was exposed to the ""Red Kryptonite"" (though they didn't call it that in the episode) and became dark/somewhat evil. They did a great job of transforming Superman/Clark to look dirty/unshaven/burned out (even his costume was darker!), and not only disinterested in helping others - but also being somewhat malicious as well. I especially liked the battle that Superman had with his good & bad selves in the junkyard; I'm guessing this battle may have been metaphorical. It was also interesting on another level, because we saw what would happen if Superman had been evil instead of good. That scene was also used in Smallville Season 2 Episode 4: Red Clark was exposed to Red kryptonite and he evil. Richard Pryor as the scam artist Gus Gorman was good and hilarious the same time - obviously, because of his inclusion many fans probably dismissed the film as a comedy; however, his presence brought a light-heartiness to the film that was reminiscent of the comedic Ned Beatty character from Superman I & II. Christopher Reeve was perfect as Clark Kent/Superman he acted brilliant his character, he is the only Superman and superhero for me.This is Richard Lester original version film and he didn't had to re shot scenes from Richard Donner. The rest of the actors did a solid job and I really didn't had any problems with them. Robert Vaughn was a great villain I am glad the franchise had a new villain in all films Lex Luthor was five time the villain in all Superman franchise movies.Ross Webster was a great villain and the scene where Vera (Annie Ross) becomes a robot and she becomes evil really scares me. Brad Wilson played by Gavan O'Herlihy: Lana's former boyfriend, the character from the first film also returns in the first film he was played by Brad Flock.Superman III is a 1983 British superhero film directed by Richard Lester, based on the DC Comics character Superman. It is the third film in the Superman film series and the last Superman film to be produced by Alexander Salkind and Ilya Salkind. I love this film to death and it is my second favorite and the last good Superman film.",Superman III
71,Ruskington,"Lazy, unnecessary and poorly edited. A huge shame that Christopher Reeve had to be involved with this fiasco",3,13 April 2020,"Why oh why would they go and make this movie? The first two Superman films, while far from perfect, were charming, entertaining and well-received. The performances by Christopher Reeve were exceptional and the music was iconic and inspiring. Superman II ended well with no loose ends to tie up. And yet, here we are with a completely unnecessary and downright awful second sequel.There are a few small positives in this film. The scenes back in Smallville with Clark and Lana are charming and nostalgic. Annette O'Toole is really likeable in the role as Lana and has all the warmth and gentleness that Margot Kidder lacked. Richard Pryor's inclusion appears to be quite polarising amongst viewers, but personally I enjoyed watching his lightly slapstick performance. And the development of 'Bad Superman' leading to the schizophrenia scrapyard showdown was a fun subplot and a good mix-up for Reeve.Overall though, this is a really lazy effort from all involved. The storyline starts off reasonably well but the last 30-40 minutes are a complete train-wreck. The special effects are laughable, showing a clear regression from the first two movies. And while it was good to see the end of Gene Hackman, his replacements, Robert Vaughn and Annie Ross, are completely inept in every way.It's such a shame to see Christopher Reeve and the Superman story mistreated so badly. While this film isn't as bad as it's ill-fated successor, it nevertheless goes down as a huge failure.",Superman III
72,russem31,"What happened, Superman?",5,27 December 2005,"After watching Superman 3 for the first time, I had to say to myself, what happened? I mean, the first two films were true to the spirit of Superman but this one takes Superman down the comedic route. The entire beginning slapstick sequence is funny enough but doesn't work whatsoever in a Superman film. And although the bad Superman angle was well done, Lex Luthor is sorely missed (with Vince Vaughn and the late Richard Pryor - RIP - not up for the acting task). I mean, Superman fighting an AI computer (which they built in what, a few weeks it seems?) - the logic has completely been thrown out the window here. And how could they make Lois Lane's character completely unimportant in this film? It's no surprise that Byran Singer wants to make Superman Returns a sequel to Superman 1 and 2 ONLY (discounting Superman 3 especially). A poorly done 5 out of 10.",Superman III

The film even had a good history if ownership for a comic strip and not for a movie; The film had lousy special effects, a little nonsense story, uninstructed villain and rather childish comments for a superhero movie. But even so, the film even has scenes that take advantage; It had a great soundtrack, a good mix of sound, a good editing (taking the special effects) and good actors. I recommend (although there are better movies to watch).",Superman III

To me, I thought it was OK. Nothing terrible or anything, but certainly not that good. Just an example of a mediocre sequel to a successful franchise.Let me start off with the positive assets, first. It does have some nice cinematography as is the beautiful scenery. The special effects are decent, score is good, Christopher Reeves did a fine job as the Man of Steel once again and the Junkyard scene is by far the best action sequence in a superhero franchise. There are also some comedic bits that got me a chuckle or two.Sadly, there are some flaws that ruined the entire movie for me. The storytelling is pretty lackluster, the direction from Richard Lester is disappointing (it's a shame since he did a fine job with his directing in the previous film), the story (aside from a decent subplot where Superman turns evil after getting affected by tobacco kryptonite), is thin and lacks the heart and charm that made the previous two so endearing, the script is awful, and aside from Christopher Reeves, the rest of the acting is a mixed bag. Margot Kidder isn't given much to do other than a cameo, Robert Vaugn's role as the villain is a poor replacement for Gene Hackman and using Richard Lester as the source of comedy doesn't work.Superman III, on it's own, is a mediocre entry to a successful franchise aside from the junkyard action sequence, which in my opinion makes it worth-watching. Besides, it isn't as terrible as Joel Schumacher's trite to the Batman franchise (I'm looking at you, Batman & Robin). It's pretty much worth-watching to those who haven't seen it, but to those who grew up with Superman might want to avoid it.",Superman III

So can the world trust a Superman who now destroys oil tankers? The movie has enough to keep you entertained and the directing and cinematography are well done. A little too slow-paced for a film. The urge to just walk away almost got me a couple of times. But, in the end, this is an excellent character study. I really like this type of series, as it reminds me of French movies where it's more about the characters and their environment. This is one of those movies that Reeves isn't only in for the paycheck.

One common critique of the film is that it side-lined Louis Lane in favour of Lana Lang and it had too much corny humour, well I agree that Louis was moved over, which is a shame after she was shown to be a romantic interest in Superman 2 but Lana isn't a bad character at all.I didn't find the action as compelling as in the previous films or with as much peril, but at least the special effects were better this time round and the evil Superman is a fantastic character, showing Reeve's range and really is the highlight of the film.6/10: Very entertaining and has just enough plot and good characters to keep it afloat",Superman III

You can tell Superman III is a lot different. I think that's a good thing. It means the movie is watchable. Superman is the most popular superhero. He's the greatest superhero from DC Comics. More greater than Batman and Wonder Woman. You get to see him in action in Superman III. Superman has another new enemy who plans to destroy him in Superman III. Can Superman stop him? Can Superman save the world? Superman and Superman II are the better movies, but Superman III is still a decent movie. Let's not forget Richard Pryor. He was the real hero in this movie. You need to see the movie what I mean by that. He made the movie fun to watch. Superman III is probably the funniest of all the Superman movies.

Clark Kent revisits his old boyhood town called Smallville, where he is reunited with an old flame named Lana Lang (Annette O'Toole) at a high school reunion during his visit. Gus comes up with a scheme to make a special kryptonite with tobacco tar to make Superman evil including splitting up with his personality so that way Gus and Webster can make their supercomputer that can control the world's energy, can Superman come back to normal or will the computer take over mankind? Enjoyable sequel but not as awesome as the first two movies, Richard Lester who did his version of ""Superman II"" just added some unnecessary comedy relief such as the ""Three Stooges""-esquire opening sequence that didn't help or that ludicrous video game footage but there was some good special effects and memorable moments like Clark Kent vs. Superman in the junkyard sequence or the part where Vera becomes a Dot Matrix from Spaceballs-like android, although Ms. Stephenson was pretty cute.All in all it's that bad folks, just relax, enjoy and suspend your disbelief.",Superman III
81,dr_foreman,"Wow, that's terrible...",4,30 December 2006,"Prior to watching Superman III, I had heard many people brand it a complete turkey, but I was willing to give it a chance anyway because I'm a fan of several ""underdog"" movies in long-running franchises (e.g. Alien 3, Star Trek V, Rocky V...) But this movie really is bad. The plot feels very random and cobbled together. The villains chuck all kinds of obstacles into Superman's path - including a weather-manipulating satellite, artificially engineered Kryponite, oodles of missiles, and a malicious supercomputer - but most of these threats are underdeveloped, impersonal and dull.The only sort-of-interesting sequence involves Superman splitting into ""good"" and ""evil"" doubles, who get in a fistfight in a junkyard. It's a somewhat surreal and effective bit of spectacle. But, on the other hand, the scene doesn't make much sense, and since it's merely a fight it can't really qualify as an intelligent exploration of the character's duality.Richard Pryor, meanwhile, fails to make any kind of impression whatsoever. He's amusing in some scenes, but on the whole his jokes - and the movie's overall sense of humor - come across as dated and ""precious"" (read: annoying). Take, for example, the scene when Pryor slings a tablecloth around his shoulders like a ""cape"" and tries to imitate Superman. It ain't funny, it just looks stupid.The special effects are another disappointing aspect. The missiles seem like something out of a Godzilla movie, while the various ray-beams look like they come from Forbidden Planet (I mean no disrespect to that movie - only to the much later Superman III!) One good thing about Superman III is that it helped me to appreciate director Richard Donner's take on the character more. The first Superman film does feature some silly comedy moments, but it also has some dignity and genuine drama. Superman III, on the only hand, is just two hours of silliness and stupidity. It's not witty, it's a condescending bore.",Superman III

84,raypdaley182,Only good in places,4,18 September 2006,"The sequence of accidents at the start is garbage. The guy hitting the metal post would fall right back, not to his right. The girl on skates could easily avoid him and not hit the cart.What are the little flaming things that catch the penguin on fire? If they are road hazard markings, surely a reflective one would be used or a battery powered light, NOT a naked flame. The guide-dog would not run after the other dog, they are specifically trained not to.Why don't the people in front of Clark notice the burning penguin or put it out and why doesn't Clark take his paper of the pile thats very visible.No bank guard would fire in a crowded street and the guy in the car had plenty of time to open a window/door and get free. None of the bystanders try to break any of the windows either, which is easy.The photo-booth would not take pictures so quickly after having money put in and most take money from the inside of the booth anyway. The guy with the bucket on his head could easily have taken it off. The 2 men who fall over are actors but the public walk over the slippery gum-balls easily.The pie man could have stepped over the gum-balls easily also. Why is the Daily Planet in the same street as the Empire State Building? (visible from the front on the street).The ""hacking"" that Gus does is impossible. He uses his employee number to hack into the company system. He's a data processor, he'd have little to limited system access. His terminal would be limited to the task he was doing and nothing else at that time. And any hack would be traced back to his employee number. Being a data processor certainly wouldn't involve a light-pen in any way. And it's unlikely the Webscoe system would accept commands typed in plain English. There was plenty of space on the road by the chemical plant for the bus to get past if the police car had moved.Inflammable? Doesn't that mean won't catch fire? Why didn't Superman freeze the acid when he was talking to the scientist. Now it's clearly stated that no-one knows where the half cents are going and aren't accounted for so how do they work out they are being defrauded?And how does Gus whose only just learned to be a data processor learn so much about hacking so quickly? (like he was taught it when he was taught DP). And Gus ""hacking"" a weather computer would NOT effect a bank ATM, or Bloomingdales Billing Department, or traffic control (they are totally independent systems). Traffic lights are very basic circuits built into the light itself.Vulcan can only monitor weather, that's all it's designed for, it would never make weather. This is totally beyond belief, that a novice hacker could reprogram a weather monitor system to actually create weather.And Gus would have smashed right through the window he landed on when he fell down the building. How can a satellite designed to predict and monitor weather analyze chemicals from an asteroid?Ricky only told his friends that Superman was coming (who wouldn't believe him anyway), so how did the whole town find out Superman was coming? And more to the point how did Gus, who isn't even in Smallville find out? Superman knows Kryptonite is green, why didn't he suspect the gift from Gus right away? Why do Lana and Ricky live in such a big house? No wonder her rent costs so much.Superman blowing out the Olympic flame is no big deal, it could easily be re-lit when he left. Oil ship steering isn't computer controlled. They might get instructions by computer but they are steered by humans as the sea is too unpredictable. No ships captain is going to take notice of orders to go to the middle of the sea and stay there. They know the lack of oil would cause chaos. Oh, and why isn't the British Reliance flying either the Union Flag or The White Ensign which she would do if she was British registered.How did Gus design a computer? He was only ever trained in data processing, Not like he learned computer architecture there. And once again we see The Statue Of Liberty (In New York) but heavily featured as near Metropolis.Am I the only one who thought the tanker should explode when Superman is welding the side closed? And how DO the Websters balloons stay inflated when they have no heat source inflating them?The instructions Websters sister gives are useless unless the people she's giving them to designed the computer. And she would have no idea how to operate the computer seeing as she's never seen it before and Gus designed it to his specifications. The screens attacking Superman are from the Atari 2600 Superman game, the sound effects are from Pac-man.Superman in a bubble with no air is no big deal, he can fly in space in a vacuum. Oh, and the string of a yo-yo would not support the weight of a fully grown man. Why didn't Gus just throw the power switch that Lorilei used to activate the computer at the cave entrance?The end for this is weak and the whole film hasn't lasted well under the passing of time.",Superman III
85,richieandsam,I love this one too!,7,4 May 2013,"SUPERMAN IIIAnother classic film.I read Still Me earlier this year. Still Me is the autobiography of Christopher Reeve. It is such a good book. But he did not like this film very much. He said that there were bits about this movie he did like, but in general it just was a bit ridiculous.I thought it was slightly ridiculous, but it is still a great film. I love the scenes where he goes to his school reunion. I think the relationship he has with Lana is so much nicer than the relationship he has with Lois. I actually wished Clark got together with Lana.The other classic scenes are the ones where Superman turns bad. I loved bad Superman. He was evil! Then the big fight where Superman was fighting Clark in the scrap yard... such a great, action packed sequence.The acting is not too bad in this one... Christopher Reeve as always does a brilliant job. The villain, Ross, is played by Robert Vaughn. He is another classic actor. But I think the star of this film (apart from Reeve) has to be Richard Pryor. I love Richard Pryor. The man was a legend. So funny and such a character in all the films he was in. When I was reading Christopher Reeves book, he said that they wrote Gus' character especially for Richard because Richard mentioned in an interview that he would love to be in a Superman movie.The effects were not bad, but you did see the strings that helped Chris Reeve fly a few times.

86,Al_The_Strange,"""Computers rule the world today. And the fellow that can fool the computers, can rule the world himself.""",5,12 June 2013,"The first two Superman films with Christopher Reeve were enjoyable and imaginative romps. Without Richard Donner behind the wheel, however, the task fell upon Richard Lester to continue the series. The man previously touched up Superman II for its release, so why not? The problem is, Superman III cranks up the camp and cheese so much that all sincerity is stripped away. Even the film's opening credit scenes are a long-running joke...literally, it's one comedic slapstick gag after another, strung together in an almost Vaudeville fashion. The rest of the film is littered with similar gags, and they often aren't that funny. At the center of it all is Richard Pryor, for some odd reason; the man seems totally out-of-place in this picture, with all his bumbling, mumbling, and unfunny antics. Oh, there is action as well, but it is of an absurd nature. The climax is a series of cheesy and unlikely events that pushes this film into bad B-movie sci-fi territory.To be fair, the story has its merits. It does touch upon some interesting ground, first by taking Superman back to Smallville for a while, and secondly be having him literally battle himself. The film also touches upon a few clever ideas, regarding oil dependency, the advent of computers, and the notion that a computer could become self-aware (I think having Superman battling a powerful AI is an inherently cool idea, but the film plays it out so cheesily that it falls way short). Otherwise, the film's story is strangely unremarkable; most of the side characters are shoved to the side, in favor of a new cast of rather uninteresting people, and most of the story is displaced by the comedy and camp.The film has its share of decent photography and editing. Christopher Reeve offers the most earnest performance here, while the rest of the cast really hams it up. Writing is pretty bad. This production seems to use a lot of ambitious sets, props, and costumes, but a lot of it hasn't aged well, and parts of it look cheap and gaudy. Music is not all that great either, despite the usual reprise of John Williams' original theme.Good for a laugh or two, but ultimately weak in so many ways, Superman III earns a marginal score from me, and represents a steep decline in quality from its predecessors.2.5/5 (Entertainment: Average | Story: Poor | Film: Poor)",Superman III

89,johnnymacbest,Surprised!!!,1,20 May 2007,"I'm surprised. No, really, I am. How can people claim that Superman 3 is better than the first 2? Amazing. Truly Amazing, considering the great talents of Richard Donner who brought one of the most beloved superheroes to life in the first film. These ""people"" obviously have no exposure to engaging and epic storytelling; that sense of wonder and genuine awe, something that this POS NEVER HAD!!! To be frank, the only redeeming qualities of this film are Ol' Supes fighting his evil twin (also known as Bizzaro) and the first appearance of Lana Lang, played by a young Annette O Toole who is much better in Smallville than she is in Superman 3. Don't even get me started on the plot because quite frankly, Superman fans and true believers, THERE IS NONE!!! The appearance of Lana Lang is for lack of a better term ""phoned in"". In short, Lana Lang was a wimp compared to Lois Lane. She's nothing more than a mere stand in than an actual love interest. The concept of Superman fighting his evil twin is a nice idea, but ultimately falls flat on its a**. As with Richard Pryor, this movie's idea of comedy relief is easily rivaled by the act of trying to scrape a used condom off the floor.This review goes out to those with an IQ of a 10 year old. Trust me because after seeing this ""film"" you may want to seek remedial attention.",Superman III
90,theshadow908,"This movie is about Richard Pryor, not Superman.",4,2 July 2006,"In Superman III, a computer genius named Gus Gorman teams up with the evil president of a big company to take Superman down using the latest computer technology. Superman ends up being exposed to synthetic kryptonite, and instead of getting hurt, he turns evil. Now the good in him must fight away the bad and destroy the evil supercomputer once and for all. Due to its lazy plot and acting, this just isn't the same as Superman's first 2 adventures.The first two Superman movies had a certain style to them that made them epic. Now, with a new director, that style is completely lost. Everything that made the first movie so good is taken away. Lex Luthor is gone, and Lois Lane's role has been shrunk down to supporting cameo. The new love interest in this film is Lana Lang, Clark's childhood sweetheart. Whereas the first movie was a great mix of action, drama, and humour, this movie is mostly humour, and a little action, because this movie is mainly meant to show off Richard Pryor's comedy skills. The plot in general is a little weak, and the villain in this is no Lex Luthor.The acting is especially weak. Christopher Reeve doesn't do such a great job as the man of steel in this entry. It seems he's getting bored. Of course, Richard Pryor completely ruins the mood of the movie with his over the top acting.Overall, this movie is a joke, not really meant to be anything otherwise, and I suggest people just ignore parts III and IV and skip right on to Superman Returns.4/10",Superman III

Contrary to popular belief, Gene Hackman is replaced not by Richard Pryor, but by Robert Vaughn as the scheming industrialist who puts Pryor to work destroying coffee crops and stopping oil pumps. Vaughn is an okay villain, but the real strength of his storyline comes from the neverending bickering between his scary sister Vera (Annie Ross) and his ""psychic nutritionist,"" Lorelei Ambrosia (Pamela Stephenson of ""History of the World, Part I""), who have some moments of true campy greatness together (""Watch closely, people, I'm about to take a human life!"") Also, Lana Lang (Annette O'Toole) is a much better love interest for Clark than Lois Lane. Lois only cares about Superman, but Lana is a real three-dimensional character as opposed to some starry-eyed girl with a crush. And while the movie does feature Superman straightening the Leaning Tower of Pisa, blowing out the Olympic Torch, and freezing a lake to drop on a chemical plant fire, it still beats his little time-turning trick.The movie works not only as a superhero flick, but a comedy.",Superman III
92,mmallon4,Clark v Superman,8,24 March 2016,"I don't deny Superman III is a flawed movie but damned if I didn't have fun with it! Even during the opening scene prior to the credits I already found myself relating to Richard Pryor's character of August 'Gus' Gorman and I thought this was supposed to be a bad movie? The monotony of a Benefits office and the employees who don't want to be there and that they probably don't like you as evident through their body language. Then Gus complains about his experience being employed by a fast food restaurant and how ""they expect you to learn that stuff in one day"". Let's just say I've had some similar real-life experiences followed by yet another one of Gus' frustrations - having your pay undercut by taxes. Ah Gus, you are my spirit animal. Ultimately I can to have no issue with Gorman sharing the spotlight with Superman in terms of screen time.The opening credits do look like they were done on Windows Movie Maker (or whatever the 1980's equivalent was) but I won't lie if I didn't say the slapstick comedy in the opening credits doesn't amuse me. The slapstick is at least done a director who understands and knows how to do physical comedy but how do I justify the use of slapstick in a movie which likely didn't need it to be used to such a degree? I could say it ties in with the fact that Clark Kent is a bumbling fool, plus the series is light-hearted and campy as a whole, so there are other movies in which the inclusion of widespread slapstick comedy could feel more out of place. Regardless, it gets a few laughs out of me. Not all of the comedy is successful in my eyes; the scene in which Gus explains Superman's exploits in Columbia is really head scratching-ly bizarre (just an odd way of progressing the plot) plus the green man and the red man in the pedestrian traffic light was going too far but I do enjoy the gags which use Superman's powers for comedic effect such as his altering of the Leaning Tower of Pisa and the blowing out of the Olympic Torch.The villain Ross Webster comes off as a lesser Lex Luthor. I still quite like Robert Vaughn's charismatic performance but I wish they could have taken the villain in a different direction rather than just being another evil business mogul. Also, why does the villain's view of Superman flying through the canyon look like a video game? It doesn't make sense but is fun to watch. By the time Vera turns into a cyborg you're better just embracing whatever crazy stuff Superman III brings along and enjoy the 80's special effects. The film's action scenes are fantastic, full of creative old-school practical effects; the highlight being Evil Superman vs. Clark Kent (a sequence which really shows of what a great and versatile actor Christopher Reeve was). Is it ironic in relation to today's needlessly dark and gritty superhero movies that Evil Superman's appearance is similar to Henry Cavill's Superman in Man of Steel, right down to the darkened colours - Forget Batman v Superman, this is where it's really at!Like Superman II, the element of the movie I found myself enjoying the most was the character relationships. I was surprised I liked Lana Lang almost as much as I do Lois Lane. Just look at the scene in which Clark and Lana are cleaning up the gym together and she tells him about her ambitions and how she wants to leave Smallville as Clark plays an instrumental rendition of Earth Angel. At this point in the movie, I thought to myself how can people dismiss this movie as much as they do? Yes, it is flawed but when you have brilliant intimate moments like this then how can you not see it isn't without merit.",Superman III

But really, why did Reeve's go along with this and I love Richard Pryor, but why is he in this? It's the most ludicrous idea ever. Everything about this movie is a running gag and props to Gene Hackman, who obviously had no trust in the script and sensibly kept away from it. There may be a minor audience for this, but I really just don't get this movie. I will never understand who sat down and read this script, then green lighted this picture.Final Verdict: It's funny because both the Batman & Superman franchises just seemed to replicate one another. A great first movie, a decent follow up then two horrendous instalments that just doesn't do the characters justice whatsoever and this has evil Superman in it!

Yet I enjoyed this movie despite its faults.  Christopher Reeve saves this movie with his good performance as Superman.  Annette O'Toole is very good as Lana Lang.  Unfortunately, Margot Kidder makes an all too brief appearance as Lois Lane.  I think if there were more scenes between Lois Lane and Lana Lang, this might have worked more.  The action scenes are very good especially between Superman and Clark Kent.  However, they pale in comparison to the fight between Superman and the three super villains in Superman II.  This movie lacks the magic the first two movies have.  If you take it on its own, you will enjoy it.

97,illbebackreviews,"Absolutely.....DIGUSTING.....how this film is considered remotely 'good""",2,27 May 2013,"Whilst I was initially disappointed watching 'Superman: The Movie' mainly in terms of having Lex Luthor as a villain, I fell in love with 'Superman II' and I somewhat hoped that 'Superman III' could in some ways attempt to resemble and continue a film that had a great story and some brilliant characters. What I got was a complete cash grab, an unintelligently written sloppy mess that provides a terrible story, poor characters, no excitement and tension and relies far too heavily on goofiness in order to pass the time and attempt to match the brilliant comedy of the first two.Superman III is based around a genius inventor named Gus who is recruited by his boss in many of his evil schemes including one of destroying Superman using Kryptonite whilst Clark Kent leaves for a high school reunion party where he meets a former friend, Lana Lang with whom he has an affair for.Next to Marlon Brando, Christopher Reeve was always the second best actor of this franchise and once more, delivers a fantastic performance in this film, generally bringing the same wit and charm to his character. Further brilliant acting by Reeve is shown during Superman's time of being evil whilst under the influence of Kryptonite. His performance is so brilliant that it is the only thing that is truly fantastic about this film. The rest is all either mediocre or downright terribleJohn Williams is my favourite composer of all time and Superman is my second favourite movie score of all time and so, his classic Superman theme is such a memorable one that I happen to love so much. The very start of Superman III was completely wrong and I knew I was in for something bad. The way the cheap looking titles crawl in did not resemble the brilliance of the original and the fact that it wasn't the classic theme playing was downright frustrating. However, when you do get to hear the classic theme play early on when Superman is trying to save the man drowning in his car (in the most ridiculous fashion), I was relieved but later disappointed considering most of the film has an uninteresting musical score that certainly doesn't make the Superman films seem that much better.There were definitely some great Superman moments, particularly early on when he is saving the man from drowning and the short scene in the photograph booth. That was somewhat of a classic Superman moment but the best moment of the film is most definitely when Superman bad is defeated and the bombastic theme song starts playing. This is brilliant for many reasons and not just because of the music but because of the character of Superman and his determination and love for his country. However, when the film is viewed as a whole, the few great Superman moments really fade considering the film heavily relies on overly goofy scenes, especially with Richard Prior's GusRichard Prior's performance in this film is most definitely not a great one but more so, an annoying one. His character is particularly uninteresting and Richard Lester and crew thought it would be appropriate to shove as much lame and unoriginal comedy to his character as possible to the point that he could never be taken seriously, even when he is afraid that Superman may be killed due to his inventions. Not only is Prior's performance ineffective but the story given to Gus is completely ridiculous that it betrays the tone of the first two Superman films. The worst thing about the film, believe it or not, is not the overuse of comedy which at times seems like a warm welcome when compared to the overall story told in this 2 hour waste of time. Much of the film deals with Gus going to Vulcan Weather Satellite and altering the weather, then building a computer to help rule everything and even steal cheques for himself. The story told in its entirety is more awful than in separate pieces and whilst the Superman story may seem great early on, by the end of the film it most definitely becomes laughable. The first two Superman films exceeded because they had great characters. Part of the reason of Superman III's failure is with all the new characters and how old characters are replaced with much worse characters. This is definitely true as Lana takes over Lois, who was a lovely woman to be around. Lex Luthor, Superman's nemesis is replaced by a man with absurd plans, Webbster. Superman III is full of clichéd new characters that add nothing good to the story.Whilst Superman: The Movie is a classic and Superman II is a great sequel, Superman III is an utter failure in all aspects suffering from poor writing and directing, overuse of recycled jokes, characters that are NOT endearing, a story that is uninteresting. This brings the film down to a joke which is pretty much the tone of the film, throwing aside the cleverness of the first two and making it a complete comedy film instead of a Superman film. Whilst there were a few Superman like moments, this is soon forgotten under the horrible mess of everything else in this awful picture.",Superman III
98,Olicosmic,A huge turn for the once iconic series,3,12 May 2019,"After the fantastic first 2 Superman films, hearing about this was exciting, as I was interested in more heroic goodness, especially after experiencing just that and more with the aforementioned films. Unfortunately, this film is where everything starts to crumble for Superman. This film is an overwhelming nosedive in quality in the series, as there's only a few redeeming qualities to be found here, unlike the infinite number in the first 2 films. The redeeming qualities, here, being the performances and presentation, as they're both almost to the standard of the first 2 films. Christopher Reeve is fantastic as always, and he really shines in a few scenes. Richard Pryor isn't too bad either, and he also offers some humor that is sometimes effective. The setup and special effects are decent for the time, meaning that this film at least looks good. But, don't be fooled. While all of that sounds well and good, everything else is just bad. The story is stupid and padded with rehashes and cliches, the overabundance of slapstick comedy doesn't work well with the tone of this type of film, the script is pretty poor, the pacing is sloppy, and the overall experience of watching this film makes you feel anything but super. This film is just annoying to watch, and compared to the 2 films prior, it's severely disappointing that this is the 3rd film we got. I understand that after 2 fantastic films back to back that a bad one was inevitable one way or another, but I didn't think it would be this depressing. With that said, I can't really recommend this film to anyone, especially to those who loved the first 2 Superman films like I did, because all this is is a tired, stupid, and annoying film that'll do nothing but disappoint. In other words, don't bother, as this is a huge turn for the once iconic series. The worst part of it all is that after this film, it gets so, so, so much worse.",Superman III
99,rparham,"Not very ""Super""",5,22 June 2006,"After two successful films, the Superman franchise was unable to sustain momentum with Superman III. Superman III continues the series slide that was slightly evident in the otherwise solid Superman II from a mix of drama, action and sly self-referential humor to more slapstick oriented, silly entries. Superman III almost wants to just be a comedy, and the film's dramatic elements are fairly lacking.As Superman III opens, Clark Kent (Christopher Reeve) is headed for a high school reunion in Smallville where he crosses paths with an old crush of his, Lana Lang (Annette O'Toole, who years later would essay the role of Martha Kent in the series Smallville), who is divorced and living in Smallville with her son Ricky (Paul Kaethler). Clark rediscovers his attraction to her and they begin what seems to be the road to a relationship. At the same time, Gus Gorman (Richard Pryor), an unemployed man who discovers he has a knack for computer programming, gets a job with Webscoe Industries and performs some hacking to inflate his paycheck. The company's head, Ross Webster (Robert Vaughan), discovers Gus' ""creative accounting"" but instead of firing him, decides to use his abilities to attempt to take control of the world's energy supplies. When Superman thwarts' Ross' plans, he has Gus use satellites to analyze the location of Krypton and determine the elements that make up Kryptonite, Superman's weakness, and plans to synthesize a version of it.Gus is unable to replicate all the elements and substitutes tar was the missing item, which produces Kryptonite that doesn't kill Superman, but instead alters his personality, causing him to be come evil and selfish. With Superman no longer helping people, Ross' plans go forward and Gus makes a request: he has designed a supercomputer that he wants Ross to build for him that will allow him to control all the computers in the world.With the presence of Richard Pryor, it is unsurprising that Superman III has a more strictly comedy directed bent, but frankly, turning the Superman series into a much more campy variety of film just doesn't work. After the first two films were able to be somewhat tongue in cheek without losing their dramatic strength, Superman III doesn't even really try to match those films. Almost everything in Superman III is played for laughs, and not even good laughs. A majority of the humor falls flat, and the whole experience proves relatively lame.A significant loss is the virtual removal of Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) from the film. She makes a brief appearance at the very beginning of the film and the very end, but is missing from the rest. She had a disagreement with the producers over the firing of Superman director Richard Donner on Superman II and so they all but removed her from Superman III. In her place they introduced Lana Lang, and Annette O'Toole is capable in the role, but the Clark/Lana relationship doesn't have the chemistry of the Clark/Lois relationship in Superman and Superman II.Superman III also suffers from lackluster villains. Ross Webster is a rather bland adversary, with Robert Vaughan attempting to channel Gene Hackman but coming up a bit short. His performance isn't terrible, but it's not great either. Gus Gorman isn't a villain, per se, more of a misguided soul, so the film somewhat vacillates between making him a bad guy and thus sucks any possible menace from him. That plus he is portrayed by Richard Pryor, who is a capable comedian, but has absolutely no ability to play a villain. He's just too nice a guy.About the only places Superman III still hits are with the still solid performance of Christopher Reeve as Superman, who manages to mostly escape unscathed, and the film's visual effects are still up to par. Otherwise, Superman III under whelms on almost every level. Not so Super, indeed.",Superman III
100,Old Joe,"The world's superhero in his toughest adventure, but not his best!",6,2 February 2001,"I can understand why people hate this movie. It is a corny comedy, which ruins the genre of Superman. But I can also understand why some people would like it. Considering it was made five years after the original blockbuster, it was never going live up to the same sort of expectation. As a movie critic who cringes at some scenes in Superman III, I can also take away something from this mediocre sequel.Superman III follows Clark Kent as he ventures back to his hometown of Smallville, to attend his high school reunion and meet up with high school sweetheart, Lana Lang. Meanwhile, billionaire businessman, Ross Webster, wants to be that little bit richer and asks for the assistance of computer genius, Gus Gorman. But to ruin the plans of Webster is Superman! So Gorman is asked to kill Superman with kryptonite. Yet the kryptonite Superman is given does not kill him, instead turns him into an evil mean creature. It's Superman fighting himself, Good verus Evil. Can Superman save himself and the world in time?The only real shining light amongst the cast again is Christopher Reeve. He is amazing. In this Superman, not only is he Superman and Clark Kent, yet he has the diverse role of being the not so super Superman. This really is the highlight of a dull shot at a third film in the Superman series. Scenes such as Superman straitening the leaning tower of Pisa and blowing out the flame to the Olympic opening ceremony were different to see from Reeve, yet he portrays this role like only he can. But the best scene in this one by far would have to be when Superman fights himself at the Car Junkyard. This scene is compelling, filled with tension and acted brilliantly by Reeve. I must say I did enjoy the direction the film took in letting us see the homeboy side of Clark Kent. Being involved at his high school reunion and the way he involved himself with his best friend, Lana Lang.
The other cast members that deserve a mention include Richard Pryor, who played the role of computer genius, Gus Gorman. It might not have been the funniest role he has done, but he was ok as the middleman in the evil money making scheme. The world has been robbed to not see the true talents of Richard Pryor. Unfortunately, Richard developed M.S. (Multiple Sclerosis) and in the last ten years or so he hasn't been on the big screen. The other role that deserves a mention here is that of Anne O'Toole. She was very attractive and portrayed the role of Lana Lang, just nicely.
But there are some bad characters in this film. Firstly that of Ross Webster, played by Robert Vaughan was not that great. Neither was that of his Sister (Anne Ross) or his personal assistant (Pamela Stephenson). There is a gap in the cast and I can explain why there is. Firstly, Margot Kidder might as well have not been scripted in this movie. She only appears in two scenes, which hold virtually no importance to the make-up of the film. Plus without Lex Luthor, the evil side of the film does suffer. Gene Hackman was brilliant in Superman I and II and could have helped bring this film up to scratch. Some of the special effects in this film were ok. Scenes like at the acid plant were pretty good. I love it when the area is in a cloud of fire and to help put out the fire, Superman just flies off to a near by lake, freezes it up and lifts a huge iceberg. This was excellent to watch. The other memorable scene with special effects would have to be at the end with the computer, it wasn't bad. I won't give it away, but trust me if you like this film you will enjoy the end.In summary, I have read the book to Superman III. It was better to read than it was too watch on screen. But at the time of it's release, this movie would have had created quite a commotion. But without brilliant director, Richard Donner, it was never going to be as good as the previous Superman films. I don't know whether to say I hate it or like, because I can flick this movie on and get involved in what it is on about. But it is nowhere near the quality and greatness that you would expect the Superman legend deserves. I must agree with the general consensus, that this film could have been much better.Rating: 3 out of 5 Stars or 6/10.",Superman III
101,dormesher-21565,Silly but still fun,7,20 January 2019,"Superman 3. Not the best sequel and not the best Superman at all but I still find it alot of fun with some great moments in it.
It does go for a more comedy style and in some moments is funny and in other moments is very goofy.Christopher Reeve again still plays a fantastic Superman and seeing Annette OTool play an older Lana was brilliant especially watching this After Smallville where she plays Martha Kent it's great seeing her have more history with the Superman legacy.Seeing an evil version of Superman in this movie was amazing and Christopher Reeve plays both versions to brilliantly and its easy the best part of this movie and the fight scene between the both versions is incredible and really well done.The score again is incredible like always and still makes me smile everytime I hear it even in a not so great movie.This movie is OK it's definitely worth watching and if you're Superman fan you will fine entertainment in it but it's not the best and does have silly moments and has more of a comedy style.Verdict 7/10 still.fun just silly but has some great action moment's",Superman III
102,axlrhodes,A Richard Pryor film that features Superman.,6,20 April 2008,"This is one of those films that you love as kid but as an adult experience it is hard to accept the choices made by the producers.Its been said countless times that this is a Richard Pryor film that happens to feature Superman.Director Richard Lester is much more interested in exploring the comic talents of Pryor than continuing the character of Superman.His style somehow merged quite well with Richard Donners when he finished the cut of Superman II but its obvious from this outing that he is not the man for the job.There are good elements such as Superman turning bad after an encounter with a dodgy dose of Kryptonite which,in truth,is largely thanks to Christopher Reeves performance.The rest of the film is messy and ill considered.An overlong slapstick introduction sequence replaces the inspirational opening credits of Donners film.Pryor seems to improvise his way through the film while Letser ignores any interesting character moments preferring silly gags which date the film and echo more in common with a British 'Carry On' movie than the epic heartfelt intentions set out for the character by original director Richard Donner.In short,a disappointment.",Superman III

104,kingofdanerds,The start of where every third film in a superhero film is bad (supposedly),4,14 June 2021,"Comedy legends typically have big hits and at times just as big misses. For Richard Pryor, Superman III was a big miss (or so it is said). After the success of the first two films, it seemed obvious that another Superman film should be made. The film was released in 1983 and was a mild box office success but was not well received at all. The film was directed by Richard Lester who previously directed Superman II. The film stars Christopher Reeve, Richard Pryor, Jackie Cooper, Marc McClure, Annette O'Toole, and Margot Kidder.A man named Gus Gorman (Richard Pryor) finds out he is a computer genius and is hired by a big and wealthy business man to use his (Gorman's) computer skills to do villainous things. But Superman is the only thing stopping him.Superman III is not a great film. That is a given. But is it truly as bad as people make it out to be? For me, no. Let's be honest, this film is nowhere near the previous two films. But, there is some good to be seen out of this film (along with some negatives). The whole intro to this film really sets the tone of this film. Gone is the epic credits in space and in is the slapstick that is not really that funny. It just does not belong in a Superman film. I welcome tone changes, but a comedic route (especially in the way executed here) is not a way. At least make the comedy funny. Speaking of which, this film gets a lot of negative reception because of Richard Pryor. Now, as stated, Richard Pryor is a comedy legend (or so it is said, I am not entirely familiar with his material). Now, seeing a supposed comedy legend not being funny in here is truly baffling. Now, I do not attribute Richard Pryor's performance to this film not performing as well. His performance, sure, it is not great. But, I also think that the people working on this film didn't allow Pryor to truly flash his comedy legend status. The comedy overall, is not very funny and I probably laughed a total of two times and probably not for the right reasons and to be honest it must not have been comedy gold because I hardly remember what I laughed at. Now, the film is mostly an unfunny comedy but there is an instance where the film does feel serious and it is probably the best scene in the movie which involves Superman's good and evil side. Which leads me to go on and say about how this film's true plot does not even get introduced until one is far into the film. Which leaves the viewer wondering where this film is even going in terms of story. I guess a lot of the scenes involving our main villain is to help establish the villain but that would mean that the villain would be one to be worth establishing. Let's be fair, the villain here sucks. I can understand why Lex Luthor is not in the film considering that Gene Hackman refused to return for this film and I would assume you could have done something with Zod and his minions. It would not be great but not nearly as bad as what we are given here. This guy wants to control the coffee production and change the weather. Lame. He is just a not so intimidating rich guy who uses money to just inconvenience the world. So, it seems that this film lacks what made the previous Superman films good, right? Yes and no. This film still has a good Reeves performance, especially when he plays the evil Superman, which, may I say, is an interesting idea. The special effects are not terrible. It is more or less the same type of effects that we have seen in the previous films with maybe an addition of (from what I remember seeing) a wire used for the flying effects. Now what is lacking is the romance. Sure, since Margot Kidder was punished (for speaking up for the treatment of Richard Donner by producers) by getting only five minutes of screen time. But fear not, we are given a romance but one that is ""just another romance"". It is not particularly interesting and lacks the substance of what made the romance in the previous movies good.Superman III is far from great but it is not nearly as bad (or at least from what I have heard) as people make it out to be. Completely watchable but do know that there are better (and far worse) Superman movies out there.",Superman III
105,David_Frames,"""This Super-man is nothing of the kind.""",5,11 November 2006,"""Quit while you're ahead"", that's what my old Mum used to say  of course this is the same woman that paid a man £200 not to install an oven with her new kitchen because she only tends to use the hob but nevertheless, good advice and what a shame that the Salkands didn't listen, but then listening isn't what they're good at is it? So what WERE they good at? Well initially ceding creative control of the Superman franchise to people who knew what they were going. Donner knew the right tone and conscious of David and Leslie Newman's shortcomings in the scripting department, the much heralded 'verisimilitude' approach substituted for camp, he'd hired Hollywood script doctor Tom Mackenwitz, to inject some box office saving self-importance into the proceedings. By the time the third instalment was gearing up Donner had been sapped of his powers but some producer slight of hand and tossed into the fortress of solitude's icy depths  his success coming at the expense of his relationship with the interfering money men. With Donner a goner, Mancewitcz went too, as did Gene Hacked off, leaving the third Superman looking a little like a beaten up Clarke Kent in a rundown diner before a single frame of film had been shot. The Salkinds, certain that their original, as yet untested, ideas about how Superman should be done would triumph over the tried and tested approach, moved quickly to undo the source of their success. In Donners place was Superman II's ""director"" Richard Lester. Anyone who'd seen a pure Lester movie would have had reason to fear this appointment  the man was a peddler of farce who liked things light and strewn with slapstick, The Three Musketeers anyone? Add to this an unrestrained David and Leslie Newman and you had the filmmaker's answer to the movie's tar infused synthetic kryptonite  it's not enough to kill Superman but it certainly going to do him some serious damage.Whether you like or loathe Superman III will depend on how seriously you take this kind of film. If, like Lester, you don't take it too seriously, then the movie's light, farcical approach dabbed with the occasional dramatic flourish will leave you with a big stupid smile on your face  the kind you used to get when someone flashed their genitals in class during a primary school maths lesson. Those who think the first two films, and we're including the second film despite Lester's involvement not because of it, got it right, have reason to feel genuinely angry  the golden goose was eviscerated here and never recovered. That it's a very different Super-outing is evident from the off with a long slapstick sequence giving us a taste of the jollies to follow. Richard Pryor, stunt cast here as the computer genius who falls in with Robert Vaughn's trio of villains, is the most obvious indication that comedy has edged out drama as the series' creative engine. The trouble is that Pryor isn't particularly good and nor is the script  the gags tending to clunk while the occasional sequence lapses into the kind of camp Donner tried so hard to avoid  the fighting green and red traffic crossing men been the most puerile example. When its good, its pretty watchable stuff - the Clarke/Lana story providing a much needed bit of grounding and Annette O'Toole, by and large replacing the exiled Kidder, is a much better catch for Supesand much easier on the eye. The Chemical plant save is pretty impressive, so too the junkyard fight between 'evil' Superman and his old self but the mirth has watered it down to tasteless proportions long before then and good leaning tower of Pisa joke aside, we're as relived as Gus when its finally all over. The Superman movie that proved Donner was right all along, it's a shame that the Salkinds took the opposite view and blamed the audience for its relative failure. When they say that nobody knows anything in the movie business here's the producers who set out to prove itand did.",Superman III
106,BrickNash,Wasted opportunity of some fantastic ideas!,6,13 April 2013,"This could of....should of been the best out of the 4 Superman films.It's not that it was bad, because it wasn't, it was just incredibly goofy.....in parts!The thing is the movie plays out like 2 different films. The Richard Pryor vehicle is pretty good in itself but unfortunately it totally marrs the great Superman film which is utterly bursting to come out from underneath!Removing the comedy Pryor parts, this film has a great story all in itself. Lana Lang, played by the beautiful Anette O' Toole is a fantastic slice of where Superman/Clark Kent came from and the scenes between O' Toole and Reeve are both revealing and very touching. Christopher Reeve is obviously enjoying this part of the romantic tale as it allows him to show a nostalgic and romantic side of Kent that he couldn't get with the more scratchy persona of Lois Lane.The best part of the film though is the most ignored segment which is the evil Suparman slice. This, combined with the Lana Lang story absolutely would have made an amazing film in itself. Far truer (at least by comparison)to the comics than the daft super computer part of the tale.Reeve positively glows with a rabid lust for being able to portray the ultimate good guy as an utter dick! The Scene where Superman gets drunk and trashes a bar with peanuts is probably worth watching the film alone!The ultimate scene has to be the junkyard battle. This would have been all the more mighty if it was evil Superman Vs Good Superman instead of evil Superman vs Clark Kent (Who obviously still has Supes powers)As a film, some aspects of it definitely are the best in the series. Reeves physical frame is the largest and most defined in the films thanks to pounding the weights and it's great to see a real dark side to the Man Of Steel.It's just a shame these aspects weren't explored deeper in the film and gave way to unnecessary comedy farce.A good, polished high budget and enjoyable film but an utter wasted opportunity to explore some well presented idea!",Superman III
107,RCWjr,The start of the end,6,26 June 2006,"This was the start of what would be a huge and sudden crash of the franchise in the theater. It is no fault of Chris Reeve, he again puts everything into Superman that was evident in the first film. We even get a nice subplot of Clark going back home and meeting up with Lana. But all of this is derailed by a absolutely ludicrous premise and the lack of any kind of true villain.We know things are going to be a lot different this go around when we are subjected to 7 minutes of pratfalls with absolutely horrendous music and credits playing in front. I don't know who decided on doing away with the famous opening credits, I am sure cost was a reason, but the opening credits are hideous. Richard Pryor was brought in and the script was tailored to his talents. Which is not a bad thing under normal circumstances. But when you are dealing with a character from an established comic mytho, having a character like Pryor's is totally out of place for the premise. Not only that, confining Pryor to a PG premise, one where he is playing a supposed computer genius, is just not smart casting. In the current DVD that details the history of Superman, Ila Salkind boasts that Superman III did really good at the box office and it was Superman IV that sunk the franchise. Well, all due respect to Salkind, but his Superman III put the iceberg in the way of the Superman ship that IV hit. This film lacked any of the charm of the first two, noticeably this was the first one that Donner had done zero work on. Further evidence that the producers sabotaged what could have been a great trio or more of films.",Superman III
108,rcolgan,Better than expected,6,27 May 2014,"Recently I finally got round to watching Superman 3. From everything I heard about it mixed with the major step down that Superman 2 was from the first Superman, I expected that downward slope to continue and for Superman 3 to be even worse. Though I was somewhat surprised by the film that it was. Whilst it was certainly nowhere near the standard of the first Superman and contained no real drama or imagination of the comics, it still remained surprisingly enjoyable and certainly a step up from Superman 2. It really surprises me to say this since I'm a comic book fanatic and I hate it when the films do not live up to their source material which this film ignores to almost it's entirety. Instead of choosing from the 45 years of the comics history of great stories, it instead follows Gus (Richard Pryor) who creates a piece of Kryptonite mixed with tar which splits Superman in two causing a good and evil version of himself to emerge to give him time to create an ultimate super computer. But just like the camp fun of the 60's Batman, this is a film that has a lot of fun with itself and embraces its own ridiculous nature. Seeing scenes like seeing an evil Superman push the Leaning Tower of Pisa up straight are absolutely ludicrous, but are still strangely enjoyable because it matches the ludicrous nature of the film. But throughout the film I couldn't help wondering why I found this funny and not Superman 2. Why could I laugh at the ridiculousness of Superman helping a small kid get a strike out in the most over the top manner and not his beating up a guy at a road café? I realised that ultimately Superman 2's attempts at drama were its downfall. By trying to keep the drama from the original Donner version and mixing with it the comedy of Lester the film failed at doing either because they counteract one another. The drama made the comedic moments feel out of place whilst the comedy meant that I could not become invested in the drama. But by focusing entirely on comedy the world loses any need for sense and allows the audience to fully embrace the comedy. Also the film does have some good action moments. Not all of these are well made with some awful effects where we're able to see the strings Superman flies on. But there is one great sequence where after Superman is split between Clarke Kent and and the evil version of Superman the two fight it out in a junkyard. It's an impressive brawl demonstrating the full extent of Superman's strength as he tries to beat himself to a pulp. It was mostly impressive seeing Reeve juggle the evil Superman with Clark Kent in an almost Jekyll and Hyde battle. Also I was very glad that Lois was not a major part of this film. She was the most irritating part of the first two films and this time her role was cut down to two scenes instead being replaced by Olsen as the damsel and Lana (Clarke's college sweetheart) as the love interest. This was a great improvement since she actually had character. She wasn't just constantly obsessed with Superman, if anything seemed to treat him more like a regular person. Through this she becomes an enjoyable character who we can become invested in. Though not all the additions to the film were good with the unfortunate choice of including Richard Pryor in the story. Whilst he can be one of the greatest stand ups at times, here he seems to only be annoying with all the jokes he tells falling flat. Also because of the awkward comedy, I'm never entirely sure how much of a villain he's supposed to be. One scene he'll be trying to take down Superman with Kryptonite and the next scene he'll be trying to stop the other villains from hurting him. Also no comedic take on Superman can ever be able to match the brilliance of the likes of Superman (1978). Superman is one of the all time iconic characters and because of this can be capable for some incredible cinematic outings. Thus it is a shame to waste such potential on only a comedy rather than attempting an all out drama for him. But for what it's intended to be Superman 3 is an enjoyable film with some good moments and whilst not anything special is still probably worth a watch.",Superman III
109,mattrochman,Great Superman sequel - underrated by traditionalists,9,3 July 2006,"This film is not worthy of the 9/10 I gave it. But I saw that the average was below 5 and I feel the need to ""corrupt"" the statistics. I want to increase this average so that score is a truer reflection of the quality and public's perception of this film.Many may think that this is unfair or unreasonable. But I regard it as a reflex reaction to traditionalists who gave it '1' because it strayed from the typical superman formula, irrespective of whether it was a good film in its own right... and it was! Since they are unfairly under-rating the film, I feel justified in over-rating the film..... DEAL WITH IT! The traditionalists want the love interest Lois Lane to feature prominently, along with the naive Jimmy Olsen, the ranting Perry White and the conniving and ruthless Lex Luthor.Well, Jimmy breaks his leg in the first 15 minutes and is (presumably) hospitalised for the rest of the film, Lois (kidder) makes a cameo appearance at the start of the film to let us know that she's going on holiday, Lex (& his numb-skull sidekick Otis) isn't even mentioned and it seems as if the Daily Planet doesn't mind if Clark Kent goes to his high school reunion and then takes the next few weeks off work. With all the plot devices removed, I was actually interested in where this movie would take me, rather than rolling my eyes before the film has even begun.First and foremost, the film opens better than any other of th0e Reeve Supermans. First, Superman saves a man from drowning in his car (wait till you see it!) and shortly after, there is a fire at a chemical factory (and superman arrives again to save the day). I felt that this opening was rather thrilling and the film makers stuck to the traditions of classic Superman.Then we move onto the story of Clark Kent rekindling a romance with a high school sweetheart, who is, at the same time, fending off an old alcoholic ex-boyfriend. This scenario gives rise to a number of funny scenes (the one at the bowling alley was side splitting). As per usual, Reeves played the part of the bumbling, geeky Clark Kent to perfection.Running along side is the story of Richard Prior. He's an unemployed bum (scenes in the welfare office are hysterical) who suddenly finds that he has a knack for computers. He commits a fraud using his extensive knowledge of computers (the fraud is later repeated - with acknowledgment - in the brilliant film ""Office Space"") and when he is caught, he assumes that he will be fired and arrested. However, his sinister boss has something else in mind for our comic computer whiz.However, their plans are thwarted by Superman and in response, Prior and his boss obtain kryptonite. However, the kryptonite is 'not quite right' and causes superman to become evil (rather than weaken him). In any case, superman is out of the way, which allows Prior and his boss go to work on a ""super computer"" that can control the world. Will Superman become good again and save the day in time? All in all, a very enjoyable film, even though there are short comings. The performances are very good and I couldn't imagine the computer whiz's part being played by anyone other than Prior. The villain was also terrific, as was his sister and co-conspirator.Yes - this does stray from the traditional Superman plot formulars. But it did so without dishonouring the Superman tradition if that makes sense. And besides, it's good to have a different villain than Lex Luthor and a break from the irritatingly unresolvable romance between Kent/Superman and Lois Lane.In closing, I found it rather amusing that the traditionalists put this effort down, but when the Reeve's series returned to it's old plot formulars (Luthor, Daily Planet, Lane...) in the woeful Superman IV - The Quest For Peace, the critics, traditionalists and general audiences all gave it a giant thumbs down!However, the film did lose a star for having this bizarre left-wing after-taste. Instead of a crazed criminal seeking world domination, the villain is a corporate boss who wants control of the coffee market and quotes Atilla the Hun. He is enraged by and destroys a small South American country that thinks it can dictate terms to the ""free market."" Clark Kent's high school crush is now a ""perfect single mother"" - see it's perfectly OK if Hollywood says so; and the film opens with poor old lovable Richard Pryor getting booted off welfare. Ironically, the villain goes for the oil towards the end of the film. But alas, Superman saved the day by ridding the world of this capitalist threat. Almost as laughable as the politically neutral ""truth, justice, and .... all that stuff"" in the recent Superman Returns. Get over it.",Superman III
110,jwpeel-1,Richard Pryor and Richard Lester and two Supermans... What else could a man want?,7,31 July 2004,"I love this movie, for those of you think it's really bad because it's too ridiculous, you must not read too many of the comics. The very first comics I never read were Superman comics, and that was when I hadn't even got into kindergarten, and let me tell you, they could be pretty silly but never boring.The same could be said for this movie. First of all, I love Richard Pryor and he has a field day in this movie. Secondly, I love Robert Vaughn, and he plays a really juicy villain in this one. And then there's this great fight scene between two Supermen... but I don't want to give away everything from those of you haven't seen the film yet.There is everything you should expect in this kind of movie. My only complaint was not enough Lois Lane (Margo Kidder) and maybe I'm nitpicking, but continuity with the other two films seems to be ignored completely. According to this entry in the series, Clark graduated from Smallville high in 1962. The problem with that is that in the first film, is clear that when Clark is in high school, it's the late 1940s by the vintage cars and trucks in the scenes. But hey, if we can believe that a man can come from another planet, fly, see through walls, burn through things with his eyes and lift trains into the air then why bitch about little things like continuity?Not only do I have this baby on video from cable TV, but I also taped the network version just for the outtakes and edited out every single commercial. (The beautifully choreographed opening credits with the blind man, some mechanical penguins on fire and more is even longer and better in the TV version.)So hate this one if you must, but I will take it over the second film any the day of the week. (That is, the Richard Lester version. I LOVED the Richard Donner cut which recently made it to DVD.)I give it a 7 out of 10.",Superman III
111,moviemattb,This is where the Superman franchise begins to fall,3,8 September 2015,"This has got to be one of the most painful, if not the most painful movie to sit through. First, you have the first one which I thought it was a classic. Second, you have the sequel where different directors have their own cut of the movie as Lester's cut did fine, but I much prefer Donner's cut. Now, we have the third movie that had just made this franchise go way overboard. I'm not happy with the direction for what this movie went, because like I said it is painful to watch. Here is my take on it: The movie centers mostly on Gus Gorman, who is nothing more but a bum as he looks for a job by working as a programmer on computers; while that is going on, CEO of the computer company, Ross Webster hires him to do on what he is being told but Superman foils his plan. So they try to make Kryptonite to kill Superman, but instead of that, his personalities has now change. On the other hand, Clark Kent returns to Smallville for a high school reunion with one of his best friends Lana Lang. So, that is what the movie is about. This plot for the third movie isn't as interesting as you thought it would. Heck, I didn't think it was that interesting either. This movie is not only having its camp factors like Lester's cut of ""Superman II,"" but having put too much comedy in it. There is nothing wrong for putting comedy in a superhero movie, but all jokes that were putted in the movie are being forced; its just trying too hard to make something on what is suppose to be funny. None of the jokes ever worked. I hated the opening scene, where instead of the tradition opening credits like the other ""Superman"" movies, they just show the city of Metropolis for becoming a madhouse as well as having the credits for making it look like the opening text crawl from the ""Star Wars"" movies. Richard Pryor is not funny in this movie, and doesn't belong here to be in this movie. I've read the movie's trivia on IMDb, where Pryor read the script and thought it was terrible, but agreed to do it for paycheck. I'll forgive Pryor for his involvement, but if he wants to be in this movie then have him play a villain or something, instead of being a comedic sidekick. The villains in this movie are uninspiring, because they couldn't used any villains from the comics but just have to be created for the movie. I honestly don't care for Ken Thorne's music or some of Giorgio Moroder's music that he created for the movie, which I find them nothing to be appealing. The acting is so-so for the cast, except for Christopher Reeve, Annette O'Toole and a small appearance from Margot Kidder. Margot Kidder's look for Lois Lane is okay, but miss the way she look in the first one and the second one in Donner's cut. Her acting is still good, but wish that she had more screen time. As for Annette O'Toole, her performance as Lana Lang is well done, but I don't find her chemistry with Christopher Reeve well enough as much as I enjoy the chemistry between Reeve and Kidder. Now for Christopher Reeve, he is still giving a great performance for playing Clark Kent and Superman, and there is nothing to dislike about him. I love him when he becomes corrupted by a fake Kryptonite as he turns to the dark side; he seems to have a blast for this role for playing such a bad superhero. I do like where evil Superman fights his ego Clark Kent as its pretty much a fight between Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. As Clark Kent finishes off his evil self, I love when the Superman theme comes in as he is now fully redeem, while he opens up his shirt by revealing his costume and fixed the damage that he caused. That is where I get the feel of that I'm watching a ""Superman"" movie, until it goes back to being painful. The child actor who plays Lana Lang's son Ricky is really annoying aside from Pryor's character. Even his acting is very wooden. The special effects are similar to Lester's cut of ""Superman II"" as there are parts that are good and bad. Lester's direction is terrible, and you still wish if the Salkinds have not fired Richard Donner for making ""Superman II"" as if this franchise would still be strong. This is not an easy movie to sit through, because at least when you have some bad movies like either ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III,"" ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine,"" or ""X-Men: The Last Stand;"" there are at least not as painful as ""Superman III."" Although, I do thought the third ""X-Men"" movie is okay, but still not good. I'm sure you're going to disagree with me on one of those movies, but that just me being bias about something. This movie sure does feel like Pryor's movie than Superman's, because Pryor really steals the show. This movie should have more scenes with Superman, than having more scenes with Pryor in it. I don't like ""Superman III,"" and I strongly don't recommend it. I give it a 3 out of 10.",Superman III
112,japamo,"Much Better the Second Time Around, But It Should Have Been ""Superman II"" in the Series,",8,6 March 2014,"After the stirring triumph of ""Superman - The Movie"" and ""Superman II"", a majority of people considered ""Superman III"" a bafflingly ignoble and comically disgraceful disappointment. At the time over 30 years ago, I was no exception. But yesterday afternoon on February 5, 2014 at about two-thirtieish P.M. I decided to watch ""Superman III"" on HBO to see if my opinion changed, especially since I had forgotten some movie scenes. You know, ""Superman"" III was much more palatable and enjoyable the second time, even though its overindulgence in slapstick and pratfalls keeps it from occupying the lofty perch of the first two Superman movies.""Superman III"" is preoccupied with the insidious threat of technology and computers, and tycoon Ross Webster's (Robert Vaughn)'s insatiable desire to exploit them, with the somewhat reluctant help of unexpected computer whiz Gus Gorman (Richard Pryor), to become still wealthier. Of course, only Superman (Christopher Reeve) can thwart this ambitiously global plan. However, three events complicate matters. One is the kindling of an unexpected romance (as Clark Kent) with Smallville High School prom queen Lana Lang (Annette O'Toole) at their high school reunion. A second, minor one is uncouth former high school football hero Brad Wilson (Gavan O'Herlihy), Lana's jealous ex-beau. The third and most formidable event is artificial, impure green kryptonite. Manufactured at Webster's bidding by Gus to kill Superman and thus stop his interference, instead it unleashes his darker, selfish impulses. Can Superman overcome these obstacles, plus a gigantic (and possibly sentient) supercomputer designed by Gus for out-and-out world domination? As I mentioned, ""Superman III"" goes overboard a bit with the physical comedy (and Pryor's hapless blundering and improvisational schtick as Gus) and seems poised to trivialize the kryptonian superhero. But Reeve, as both Kent and Superman, maintain things on a dignified but touching keel, handling sweet romance, outrageous disasters, and planetary threats with a nimble mixture of seriousness and self-deprecation. In other words, Superman never becomes a joke. Even when the ersatz kryptonite and the pleas of Lana's son Ricky force Superman to confront his malicious Hyde-like alter ego in an externalized, knockdown, junkyard battle for his soul, it somehow rises above absurdity to a gripping psychological revelation: even a Superman has his demons. Furthermore, Superman atones for his misdeeds (not really so much felonies as mischievous misdemeanors) like pushing the Tower of Pisa back to leaning position. Furthermore, besides the supercomputer, ""Superman III"" has its share of disasters for Superman to tackle, like an explosive chemical plant fire, tornado, missile assault, and female cyborg.Perhaps the only true flaw in ""Superman III"" is its position in the series. Maybe it should have been the second one, since the first movie does have its comedic pleasures and was just beginning to test Superman and ""Superman III"" could have been a more logical extension of the first, leading to a crescendo to ""Superman II"" where Superman's powers were tested to the limit. Entertaining as Richard Vaughn's greedy CEO was, it might have been better to retain Lex Luthor in the corporate role to keep the continuity going and employ a delectable teaming of Gene Hackman and Richard Pryor. While I'm making ""Monday morning quarterback"" suggestions, perhaps Brainiac and red kryptonite (which has unpredictable effects on Superman) could have found their way into the plot. It's just speculation.The simple point is is that ""Superman III"" is not quite ridiculous as it seems, mainly because Reeve believes in both his Clark Kent and Superman personas and helps both personas reasonably rise above the outlandish doings.",Superman III

114,phillafella,Where Are Lois Lane and Lex Luther When We Need Them?,3,23 June 2003,"SUPERMAN III is an interesting film, but it is very much a disappointment. It lacks everything the first two SUPERMAN movies had.  This time, there is no real villain since Gene Hackman's Lex Luther character is missing in action, and there is not much screen time for Margot Kidder's Lois Lane. Instead we get Richard Pryor, whom I say is one of the greatest comedians of all time, playing a computer hacker, but the problem is that Pryor is not fit for a role like this, and it's probably what killed his film career, and also what caused the likeable film series to go downhill.  I would still recommend SUPERMAN III for fans of the comic book superhero, though.2 out of 5",Superman III
115,Marx_Bros_Fan86,Wasted potential,5,31 July 2008,"Superman III has a few moments of greatness, but overall it is a failure. Contrary to popular belief, it did not bomb, but it is just not as endearing as the first two. Richard Pryor plays Gus Gorman, a computer hacker who ends up working for the millionaire Ross Webster (Robert Vaughn). Webster is really just a third rate Lex Luthor. It's sad that they had to copy Luthor in the only Superman film that he does not appear in! Gorman and Webster come up with some plan to control the weather with computers, and to get Superman out of the way, Gorman invents synthetic Kryptonite.In the mean time, Clark Kent goes back to Smallville for his High School Reunion, and reunites with his old girlfriend Lana Lang, who is now a single mother. Their romance is not as exciting as the Clark-Lois-Superman love triangle in the first two films, but it does present us with a Clark Kent that is more down to earth and less of a disguise. Unfortunately Gorman ruins everything for Superman when he presents the fake Kryptonite to him as a gift. The Kryptonite has an unexpected effect on Superman- it turns him evil, and he wreaks havoc all over the world.The most common criticism of Superman III is that it is not really a Superman movie, but a Richard Pryor film with Superman in it. I think this is definitely true. Richard Lester went far too overboard on the humor here. It is much more intrusive here than it ever was in the first two films. I think after making two films about one character, it is OK to focus more on a bad guy, but only when the bad guy is a good character. Gorman is some kind of bad sitcom character and feels out of place in a Superman film.What frustrates me the most about this film is the wasted potential. So many of the ideas in the script could have been executed better. The evil Superman story was a great idea, but it does not take up a considerable amount of time. Can you imagine a movie where Superman turns evil, and his human friends try to bring him back? That would have made for some great comic book melodrama! The scene where Superman fights Clark Kent ranks as one of the best moments of the series. It was a good metaphorical way to portray the good side of Clark Kent trying to take over his body again. Unfortunately the bad Superman story is played mostly for laughs, so it does not come close to saving the film.Lois Lane is also sorely missed. It is rumored that Margot Kidder hated the Salkinds so much for firing Richard Donner that she did not cooperate when Richard Lester took over Superman II, so the Salkinds decided to give her a 5 minute cameo in this movie. Her presence could have made the film so much more interesting. Lana Lang loves Clark Kent for who he is, whereas Lois Lane loves Superman. Having to choose between the two women would have been a very interesting dilemma for Superman. Who would he be happier with? It would be like deciding which side of himself is more important to him. They tried to do something like this in Superman IV, but it was played for laughs since Clark was not in love with Mariel Hemingway.While Superman III has good action scenes, the best special effects in the series, and a sincere performance from Christopher Reeve, I cannot recommend this film.",Superman III

117,brent_or,Weird...Why?,5,9 September 2012,"This is just a weird film. If you accept the fact that it is composed partly of light, throwaway comedic sketches interspersed with some interesting looks into Clark Kent's past, interspersed with some marginally compelling Superman action, then maybe it isn't that bad of a viewing experience. At least it makes no real pretensions of being a serious or dramatic take. But as for my personal opinion, I find it very disappointing that the creators of Superman III did not take it more seriously.Anyway, I enjoy Annette O'Toole's turn as Lana Lang; I feel that she has a good grounding effect on Clark Kent (as in real or down-to-earth). No disrespect to Margot Kidder's Lois Lane, but I found Lana to be a refreshing change of pace. I also like the utilization of computers as a plot device. It is too bad that Brainiac was not specifically figured into this story (I understand that to have been an abandoned part of the initial plan, or somesuch), but the more general ""supercomputer"" is a good, relevant threat for Superman to be up against. While this film does not feature the best depiction possible by any means, it is still a good concept.This, like some of the other more screwbally early superhero films, is a fun one for kids. It would also probably be a fun trip for Mystery Science Theater 3000 to take. For me, it is pretty far down towards the bottom of my superhero film list, but it is not the worst.",Superman III

Richard Pryor may be a great comedian, but here he's just an idiot who somehow goes from vagabond to computer genius, and villains are nothing threatening.

First, Ross forces Gus Gorman to alter the weather satellites on a computer mainframe system, so that the altering will cause a major tropical storm in Colombia that would destroy the country's coffee crop and terribly destroy the world markets that depend on that valuable crop.Gus does his evil deed but was informed that Superman countered this super-storm over Columbia by his common super-strengths (like turning a twister upside down or blowing strong winds with his mouth to dry up the flooded crops), which made Ross mad.Then, the second prong is to find Superman's chemical qualities, which included of course, Kryptonite, made of course from the planet Krypton, which detonated completely by the super-heating sun in the first Superman movie. Gus gets back to a mainframe computer station and does find the exact chemical qualities in the Krypton, and then, a Krypton rock is sent to Superman, and then, Superman becomes two parts--one angry and drunk--called ""bad Superman"", and the other part, called ""good Superman."" This leads to the final battle in a garbage dump between the two different Supermans...finally, a choke hold by the good Superman ends the bad Superman for good.The third prong attack on the good Superman (with the ""bad Superman"" now gone) focuses on Gus's design of a supercomputer somewhere in the desert Southwest. Ross then beckons Superman in the final conflict, and Superman knows that he has to be stopped before the supercomputer rules Ross's goal of world conquest that could lead to worldwide chaos and destruction.This third prong attack was in 2 stages. In stage 1, as Superman comes towards the location of the cave from the outside, he is greeted by plenty of surface-to-air rockets (part of the computer's exterior defense system) that aims toward him, but Superman does evade the destructive missiles as Ross, along with two lady assistants, uses the supercomputer as some time of video game as they were destined to kill Superman. When those regular missiles were ineffective, there was a call to fire the MX--a much bigger surface-to-air missile, which does hit Superman and he falls to the ground near the cave. At the same time, Gus Gorman goes into the cave and sees his computer creation come to life. Gus then is greeted graciously by Ross, to join in the computer's bells and whistles to try to finish off Superman.Superman does get up and go right into the supercomputer cave, and tells Ross that this game is over. This leads to Stage 2 of Ross's attack, when Ross then stops Superman with the computer's Krypton laser pulse--the chemical Gus made. As Superman is stunned in terrible pain and collapses, Gus then runs into the main power switch and pulls the plug, turning the whole computer off.This buys time for Superman, but suddenly, the computer goes on again, and Gus realizes that the computer wants to be something like a monster. It had gone completely mad, and one lady assistant is entrapped by the device and becomes an evil cyborg. Superman leaves the cave and comes back with a closed special acid canister that is inert. He then stops the cyborg, but then the mad computer was about the eat at Superman with shock hits and is about to fatally entrap him; at this point, he opens up the acid canister, and the acid does its work. It eats away and then destroys the whole supercomputer from the inside out--starting with small--and then big--explosions.The supercomputer is now rubble with twisted and bent steel, and Superman comes out from the destruction, was able to find Gus alive (he hid somewhere to evade the carnage), and takes Gus back alive, out of the cave, to his original workplace. Superman says that the other people will be brought to justice, including Ross.From all of the seriousness of this flick, there is a lighter part of this movie where Lois Lane is introduced to a brand new writer for the Daily Planet, Lana Lane.

122,Tyson14,Unnecessarily bad,2,16 August 2014,"Movies like this beg many questions. One prime question that was running through my mind during my viewing of ""Superman III"" was ""How could they screw this up so bad?"" Other questions, such as ""What were they thinking"" and ""Why didn't someone tell them this was a bad idea"" also popped up sporadically. When the two previous movies were a smash and had good stories going for them (despite limited special effects) you really wonder where things went so wrong. See, it's not that the third installment in the ""Superman"" movie franchise is bad...it's completely horrible!All the familiar cast members show up again -- from Superman himself, Christopher Reeve, to Jackie Cooper, Marc McClure, and even Margot Kidder, doing what can only be described as a ""brief cameo"" as Lois Lane. This time, Gene Hackman's brilliant Lex Luthor is substituted for a new villain (who is so forgettable, it's sad) as played by Robert Vaughn. The story itself is outright ridiculous, and I swear the script was written by an A.D.D. riddled eight-year old. Not only do we have Superman heading home for to Smallville for a class reunion, but he forgets his feelings for Lois Lane, and falls for hometown honey, Lana Lang (played by Annette O'Toole). In the midst of this, a Kryptonite substitute splits Kent in two -- one part good, one part evil -- which reduces to an admittedly amusing scene where Superman gets drunk in public and loses his temper. Eventually, he settles his differences in a Fight Club-esque manner -- which is more ridiculous than it sounds -- in order to make way for some more subplots that make absolutely no sense and go nowhere. From controlled weather changes, to a super-computer that merges itself with a woman, to a video-game being played by the villain against Superman, what happens in this movie is best forgotten. In fact, I'll be damned if I can sort any of it out. I started dipping into an insanity and boredom induced coma towards the end of it.Put quite simply: This movie makes no sense. When it's not being outright cheesy, it just betrays the spirit of the first two movies. What a surprise, since ""Superman II"" director Richard Lester was behind the lens. Which still begs the question: What went wrong here? This should have been a good movie. No wonder nearly twenty years went by after ""Superman IV"" before we got a new movie. Movies like this do no good. I only gave ""Superman III"" the two-stars because, for one thing, Richard Pryor was entertaining in every scene, and for another, because it was a thrill to see Superman burst into a drunken rage.

123,the_mysteriousx,A Pastiche of Superman's world according to Richard Lester,4,25 October 2004,"When you have talented actors like Christopher Reeve, Richard Pryor and Robert Vaughn, Director Lester clearly thinks it's easier to be cheesier and still come out with a consistent film. If we can agree that it's okay to betray the Superman mythos, then what's bad about this film is it's severely dated and it has the look of one-take Richard Lester. When you see the quality of the image and the framing in part 1 and see Lester's sort of shoot-on-the-go approach, it doesn't mean Lester's direction is worse, but it does show that he does not have the same feeling for image that Donner had. Lester's style is documentary-like.Superman 3 is a mess of a film. If you can be entertained by a PG Pryor and love completely absurd moments like him skiing off a skyscraper and landing perfectly unharmed on his feet hundreds of feet below, then god bless you. Even the best part of the film - the junkyard scene - makes no sense. Really, how are there two separated Supermans? We just have to follow along. I'll admit, if I'm looking for mindless, and I do mean mindless pleasure, like a bad b-movie from the 1940s, then that's what this film has to offer. It betrays true Superman fans, though, and doesn't mind smearing it in their faces either. Is this technically a bad film? Yeah, it's ugly. But, it has a style of ugly that can be pretty to some. 6 out of 7 days of the week I'll hate it. The other day I consider it mindless fun and I can be entertained by it.

Do we take on the move from the epic battle of good and evil displayed in the first two films, to the high camp, low comedy farce the Salkind's employ here? Or perhaps the fact this is clearly designed more as a vehicle for Richard Pryor than the eponymous Man of Steel himself? Or the actual story, a now hilariously outdated mesh of computer-based warfare that's about as low rent a source of villainy against Superman as you're likely to find? Lets just say that it's quite astounding Hollywood managed to later make a worse Superman movie than this one.It wants to be a comedy with elements of super heroism and comic book lore, but Richard Lester - taking the reins fully here - alienates immediately with a woeful opening farcical physical 'comedy' credit sequence that is more Benny Hill than DC (even Benny's long time stooge Bob Todd crops up!). It doesn't get much better than that, frankly - even with Pryor, who most would agree on his day was up there with the comic best, but he's saddled with a crutch of a character in Gus Gorman and a poorer script giving him little room to improvise, not helped by the fact he gets way way too much screen time (yet Margot Kidder gets two scenes as Lois Lane, mainly there to explain why she's not in the film! The real reason apparently was the Salkind's reduced her role after a spat). Throw in the dependable Robert Vaughn as a rent-a- smarm almost-Lex Luthor-but not, and Pamela Stephenson as a shrill bimbo henchwoman and you have a recipe for absolute annoyance. The biggest crime, beyond these characters, is the plot takes FOREVER to get moving and then goes almost nowhere - building to a hilariously contrived way of exploring 'Bizarro' and duplicating 'evil Superman'. The junk yard battle between Bizarro & Clark is probably the highlight, but its over before it begins and it's not zero in the way of real depth truly exploring what the darker side of Superman truly means (he spends most of it getting drunk and messing about, like the awful Pisa gag, which can quite frankly pisa-off).Does this one have any redeeming features? Well there's Reeve, the poor fella, making the best of what he must have known was bad - as ever charming and warm in the role, but despite a poor script he makes a decent go of the five@o'clock shadow Bizarro & it's a shame that darker element wasn't better explored, as Reeve gives it possibilities. Equally, his dynamic with Annette O'Toole (who just looks gorgeous throughout) as Lana Lang works, to some extent almost as well as his chemistry with Kidder, and its this relationship that keeps the piece just about on the rails - even if that too isn't explored to the depth it deserved. Beyond that, there's almost nothing to make sitting through this worthwhile.You sense Superman III was made not to truly advance or explore the character himself, but rather for other reasons - working with Richard Pryor, blending comic nonsense with 'new' technology - and it really does show. The era this was made is no excuse - even though we were years away from comic book movies on film truly growing up, there was no excuse for such a leaden, plot less, unfunny campathon as we are given here. The real tragedy? It gets worse from here...",Superman III
127,charlieoso,Series Staring to Show Cracks in Armour,5,30 January 2021,"Christopher Reeve is back once again as Superman/Clark Kent and does great in the blue and red adding much needed spark to really a lower quality Superman sequel.After being introduced to Gus Gorman (Richard Pryor) a man who can not seem to find a job that will stick with him and a mega-silly opening running during the credits we see Gorman ripping off Webscoe the company he works for by taking all the half cents that were not paid out to employers in a payout to himself. He is quickly caught by the big boss Ross Webster (Robert Vaughn) and his sister Vera (Annie Ross) where a plan is hatched for them to be much more involved in the price of coffee in Colombia. No really that's the plan. Only Superman is there to thwart their plans.Richard Lester returns as director in the third installment. It seems like he was wanting to direct a Richard Pryor comedy rather than a Superman film and they ain't the same thing. Plays much more like a comedy due to leaning on Pryor for laughs, lack of any real good action sequences early in the film and ongoing attempts to make the audience laugh. I did think Richard Pryor was in fact quite good in his role and grabbed a few good laughs out of me, but that type of character with that type of screen-time was unneeded in a Superman film. The other thing I did not like was compared to the previous two entries the villains in this film were very weak. They would be no fight for Superman, but most rely on a computer to battle Superman in the final scene.One thing that really does work and continues to work is Christoper Reeve as Superman. He adds a star to my rating due to his performance here. By the 3rd act the film evolves into some good elements only to slip in the final 10 minutes. I thought the idea of the darker Superman who throws away the basic goodness of Superman and the battle between the good and evil Superman was pretty cool and very well delivered by Reeve.Written by David and Leslie Newman who co-wrote parts 1 and 2. Also starring Annette O'Toole as Clark's old love interest Lana Lang. The whole idea of Clark returning to Smallville was a great idea, but in the end was actually kind of boring and did not spice up the film as it should have for me.",Superman III
128,superboy478,The Salkind's Have Done it Again!,9,27 February 2002,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Superman III is not an epic, but an awsome sci-fi thriller. What made it so great is that there are new characters, new story, new villians, new style. We'd seen the first two Superman movies and noticed that they were both epics. Well, be ready for something new.Gus Gorman (Richard Pryor) has been unemployed for 36 weeks and is looking for a job. Its discovered by a computer teacher, that Gorman is the best computer hacker on the face of the earth. So, Gorman is hired to work at a computer industry known as Webscoe Industries. After embezling money from the pay roll department, Ross Webster (Robert Vaughn) begins to notice what a genius Gorman is. So he and Gorman try and pull off a scam by destroying Colombia, South America with the weather. But, it's discovered on the news that Superman (Christopher Reeve) has saved Colombia from the scam. So, Gorman finds out that Superman's weakness is Kryptonite. That ends up giving Gorman the idea that he could splice tobacco tar with Kryptonite and it could turn Superman into a dangerous predator towards the earth. When Superman recieves the Kryptonite not knowing what it is, he does turn into an evil one. Gorman and Webster then talk about taking all the oil in the world so that nothing can run like ships and such.Later on, Superman (the evil version) finally cracks and has a battle with Clark Kent in a junkyard. It becomes a fight to the death when Clark Kent wins and finally turns good again. Now its a battle with Gus Gorman, which will be hard to win since Gorman personally had a special computer built in Alberta, Canada. This computer can destroy anything that trys to attack it. So the end is a battle between Superman and Gorman.I should also mention that Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) is in the movie, but only in two scenes. This time, Clark Kent goes to his high school reunion in Smallville and sees his high school crush, Lana Lang (Annette O' Toole) and immediatley falls in love with her all over again. He also develops a friendship with her son Ricky.Other stars in the movie are: Pamela Stephenson as the menacing Lorelie Ambrosia, Annie Ross as Vera Webster (Ross's Sister), and Gavin O' Herlihy as Lana Lang's ex-boyfriend Brad Wilson.Produced by Alexander & Ilya Salkind, Superman III is an awsome sequel with great special effects, great acting, great screen writing from David and Leslie Newman (Superman I & II). See it!",Superman III
129,brower8,It breaks the great rule of movie making,3,13 September 2004,"Film-making is one of the most comprehensive of artistic enterprises. Whatever other artistic activities it uses, the most essential component is story-telling. One can be subtle, but one dares not confuse the audience.Superman is supposed to be a good guy, but here he gets some ""kryptonite"" that instead of weakening him makes a villain of him. Yes, we can accept that Superman could weaken into a real Clark Kent if he so chooses, but turning into a bad guy whose vanity causes him to make travesties of human rituals and culture?It is not subtle; it is confusing, and confusing a mass audience is unforgivable. Movies are storytelling, and at that this movie fails badly.So here's how I see the tetralogy:Superman: the movie .... 7 -- good but not great.Superman II .... 6 -- entertaining, suitable for occasional watching, especially of one likes the genre.Superman III .... 3 -- clearly substandard, and best forgottenSuperman IV .... 2 -- What were they thinking? Better yet, were they thinking?",Superman III
130,jc1305us,"Good, but could have been so much better",6,26 March 2014,"They say the third time is the charm, but I might tend to think that this movie proves the law of diminishing returns. To be fair though, the first two Superman movies were SO good, with such great stories and talented casts, that even had all the elements come together for a third film with all the original cast and crew, it still might not measure up. Oh what could have been though! After being fired while directing Superman II, Richard Donner (Who directed the original) was replaced by British filmmaker Richard Lester, who, a competent director in his own right, was maybe not the right fit for the tone of the original Superman films. Out was the somewhat dark, serious film, and in was the overly slapstick style that began in the middle of Superman II. Returning to direct the third installment, Lester again throws sight gags at us as if it was his job. The opening montage starts out with a bank robbery then slides down the slope into pratfalls, and pie in the face routines. Richard Pryor as computer genius August 'Gus' Gorman, lays it on a bit thick, and is really wasted in what could have been a better part. But really, there lies the problem with Superman III. Instead of battling Lex Luthor, or Zod, Superman is set upon by Richard Pryor, a boring business tycoon and a supercomputer! Instead of a known villain, we get jobbed. As if the producers just didn't care to invest the time into really writing a strong story with a great conflict. What they do accomplish however, is staging some very good action sequences, whereby Superman saves the day in several different scenes. The most exciting in my opinion, being the fight between the 'Good' and 'Evil' Superman, a high point for the series. In addition, the back story of Clark's life in Smallville is brought to the fore as we are introduced to Lana, Clark's high school crush, (Annette O'Tool) in a fun trip back to where it all began for Clark on Earth. Kudos must go to Christopher Reeve for his portrayal of three characters, Clark Kent, Superman, and Bizzarro Superman. He was a wonderful talent and this movie really shows off his acting chops. The rest of the cast holds their own, but the script is not up to par, so you really can't blame them. What could have been a GREAT cap to the series is only a fair effort, a shame as this was the last gasp of a great series of films.",Superman III

133,Baldach,A Good Pryor movie with plot holes,6,10 June 2002,"I still think that Richard Pryor had more talent in this movie than Christopher Reeve. Pryor was comical acting as an out of work man (his last job was for 15 minutes as a dish washer :))who discovers he has a gift of computer programming. I really enjoyed the style that Gus (Pryor) used to make money for himself and his evil boss.  The other plot of Clark Kent (Reeves) going back to Smallville to reunite with Lana was all right but not thrilling.  The plot holes start when the evil boss decides to freeze Colombia, not more than a minute after the evil boss turns off the TV news, in comes Gus. Gus spends the next 3 minutes describing how the TV news showed Superman saving Colombia. The time factor does not fit.  The plot holes widening when Superman splits into an evil ego and his good Clark Kent ego. These two ego then fight each other in a confusing battle at a auto junkyard.  Overall Pryor saves this otherwise mediocre movie.",Superman III
134,k_g_barreto,"Not so bad, but still a disappointing Superman film",5,6 December 2019,"The third movie of the Reeve's era as Superman is not as good as the second film, and by far worse than the first one. No explanation at all, I mean, it's a Superman movie, it's not meant to be scientifically accurate, but why the kryptonite changed Superman like that, and how in hell did Clark Kent get out of his own body? It is what it is? No explanation in the movie and that's it. And here we have a forgettable villain, Ross or whatever, a generic Lex Luthor who have its own Teschmacher, a hot blonde with a strange voice, and that's as far as it goes. Richard Pryor's character is sometimes annoying, I'm not from US so I never heard of him, but looks like he's a famous comedian, unfortunely I didn't get a better first impression. I laughed sometimes, but it was because of how it was bad. So bad it was good, if that makes sense. And talking about laughs, the comedic tone of the movie didn't work to me sometimes, I understand it's a family (and what about that scene with Clark and Pamela?), but it was too much and infatile sometimes.And there's much more weaker points than its predecessors: a weaker soundtrack, weaker visual effects, Christopher Reeve wasn't good as he was, but it was still good, despite the script he have to work on, and a weaker screenplay after all. Ross is forgettable, not as good as Hackman's Luthor, and General Zod was a lote more fun and much more iconic. His siter, Vera, is just whatever. I didn't care and she was the center of one of the worts scenes in the movie, that is when she's become a cyborg. God, that was awful. And the only memorable are the bad ones. When Superman gets a and goes to almost destroy a ship just to smash Ross's lover, part of his plan, of course, but no worries, he was 'sick' because of the kryptonite, and the explanation was what? Oh, there isn't any in the film. Basically everything with Gus in it. And the fight between Clark and Superman. But that was cool at least, I give that.In the end, it was disappoiting, but still watchable, you can see it in a evening when there's nothing else to do, even with much better things to watch than this. Superman deserved more.",Superman III
135,The Spectacular Spider-Man,One of the better comicbook movies around,10,7 November 2003,"Cool things about Superman III: 
1. Reeve gives his best Superman performance; no messing about, kick ass and take names heroics. I love it. 2. The junkyard fight scene, the best superhero movie fight sequence ever, outside the Matrix trilogy. 3. When Clark becomes Superman again after that fight scene; the way he stands up, realises who he is and then rips his shirt open to reveal the clean, fresh, heroic S symbol is awesome, and is one of the most stirring and effective Superman moments ever. 4. Best special effects of the series. 5. Richard Pryor IS funny, even though he is clearly in the wrong flick. 6. That nasty Zelda-from-Terrahawks cyborg monster that woman gets turned into at the end - SCARY! 7. Lana Lang is so much better than Lois Lane, you can actually see why Clark would go for her. 8. The way Superman outwits the computer at the climax rather than just using his power to defeat it. Here's the ultimate cool thing: when most actors play evil versions of their characters, they just play them as 2D bad guys. But Reeve makes the evil Superman a convincingly bitter, currupted version of the Man of Steel, who realises how great he used to be and hates himself and everybody else for his fall from grace. He's a disgraced hero, a fallen angel. Ironically, he's the best villain of teh Superman series. The whole good/evil Superman thing is awesome and for me makes Superman III a very good film.

139,MovieBuffMarine,"Not bad, but not on par with the previous movies",5,24 October 2017,"I remember way back in fifth grade, my classmate saying he won't see Superman III because it has Richard Pryor in it and thought it will just be a comedy. Well the movie came and went. While this sequel was not as good as the previous two, Richard Pryor in my opinion, did NOT ruin it and had little to do with how it turned out.It is true that Pryor as Gus Gorman brought some comic relief for this movie, but it did not ""ruin"" it. All Mr. Pryor had was the script that he was provided and was limited to that. Mr. Pryor even thought the screenplay was terrible!Robert Vaughn played new villain, Ross Webster and it's hard to find a role of Vaughn to hate. But again, he was just as limited to the script.Superman getting effected by the synthetic Kryptonite was a good touch. It brought the needed conflict to a Superman story. This may have been the few qualities of this sequel as Superman always faces conflict.Unfortunately, Reeve reprising the iconic role and bringing in seasoned actors were not enough to boost the story. While again, in my opinion, this was totally watchable, you can see it didn't follow the last two films in quality.It seemed like the writers did a sleepy job of this sequel. Not only were the fans disappointed, but the players. This would be the end of the line for the producers (the Salkinds) for this iteration of Superman with no opportunity to redeem themselves. While this iteration of Superman continued for one more film, unfortunately everything went from mediocre to worse. While not the final film in the Christopher Reeve iteration, Superman III signaled the end of this era and without the quality that made it a hit five years earlier.",Superman III

Ross decides to use him, in a way to help Webster with his plans for economic control. When the man of steel interferes, Webster wants to get rid of him. When Gus' synthetic Kryptonite fails to kill Superman, it turns him in an evil incarnation of his former self.With returning director Richard Lester (Superman II) and comedian Richard Pryor added to the mix the film stumbles a lot with its comedic inconsistencies. If you didn't like the slapstick elements of Superman II you're in for a treat because Superman III is full of this sort of nonsense.The opening credits scene is just a prolonged slapstick sequence of people being clumsy. There are endless gags from robotic penguins turning on fire to a blind man causing chaos, it was a silly direction to go as it makes it feel like a spoof. Another annoying example later on involves Pryor jumping off a building with Skis and a pink table cloth. It's this sort of stuff that really weigh the film down.At the core of it all it's quite a serious storyline because it involves computer hacking and the collapse of the civilised world and on top of that Superman/Clark Kent turns bad. With him turning bad what do they do? Well aside from him not helping people, he does petty acts of vandalism like wreaking a bar, blowing out the Olympic Flame and straightening the leaning tower of pesa.With the computer hacking storyline characters hack a satellite and turn it into some sort of weather machine. They also use computers to stop oil coming into the country and its all about a millionaire who just wants to gain more money. He's basically the same egomaniac Lex Luther was and a lot less interesting. Superman III has some good ideas but it fails a lot in it's execution.There are a few good things to take away from it, as always Christopher Reeve does a great job as Superman and aside from some cheap green screen effects the majority of the special effects look great. Evil Superman fighting Clark Kent was a highlight and it was really intriguing to see this side of him. Richard Pryor was miscast as computer programmer Gus Gorman and all of his scenes feel forced for the sake of cheesy humour.Superman turning bad would have made for a great story alone, but the writers chose to add other storylines and characters that feel pointless. It was so unfocused to the point where you forget about certain characters who just randomly pop up later on and you'll be like 'oh yeah there's that person as well'.The climax was ridiculous because there was so much going on making very little sense - Superman is stunned by a Kryptonite beam and rather than move out of the way he just stays in plain view of it. One of the villains gets turned into a cyborg and there are just so many genuinely cheesy moments like Superman getting imprisoned in a plastic bubble.

We can't have a Superman movie without Lex Luthor!"" Get over it and stop being so dull. Familiarity breeds contempt. This movie had the balls to do something different. And it worked out just great.It's funny that a movie so scorned by 'uberfans' should contain one of the best sequences of all the movies: The Superman V's Clark Kent battle. The 'purists' must be feeling very sick that such a great scene was not included in Richard Donner's movie. Leave it to Richard Lester, the enemy of most Superman fans, to pull of such a great scene! Well done, Mr. Lester.People complain that Gus Gorman is just too comedic yet Richard Donner's movie gave us 'Otis' (Ned Beatty), a character that makes Gus Gorman look serious.There is never a dull moment in Superman III.

Nothing special, just a guilty pleasure.I know, I know, Super 1 and 2 (specially Donner version of 2) are great, wonderful films! But when I was little, I used to go to school, my mom was doing laundry, father working, back from school, it was the 80's, starts raining, couldn't get out of the house, finished homework from school, standing on our living room, playing with my action figures, reading my comics, listening to the vinyl records on our sound, and then I got bored and decided to turn on the TV and there it was, Superman III.And I used to watch this movie on TV a lot, so I just got nostalgic feelings by it. I didn't know any better, Richard Pryor always looked nice on the film for me and I used to laugh at him a lot. Of course I was little and unfamiliarized with his other films, specially the ones with Gene Wilder, so I just kept watching Super III.I mean, when you grow up, you tend to judge things a lot better, but for the time being, I used to have some mindless fun with this movie, and once it kept me from being bored on rainy days, I guess it did a good job on me.So I think it's not a terrible movie after all. Undeniably flawed, yes, weaker than its predecessors, no doubt! There is nothing epic or breathtaking about this one.

143,clh-1,Problems at the door...,8,1 May 2005,"Superman III is something of a mixed bag, it is quite clear that the producers/director chose to go for a comedic take on the film series, but this is quite common for the third entry in film series to try and play it for laughs, it also happened with Jaws, Batman, and even the Terminator series. Some people think that this went too far, but I don't it is a movie that is incredibly enjoyable, every actor does their best with their roles as written, any problems with the characters come from the scripts, not the actors. Of course Christopher Reeve is in top form here (I dare you to name a role he did where he wasn't). But of special note are Richard Pryor and Annette O'Toole. Pryor proves that he is a true comedic genius by abandoning his profane style and proving that he can be funny for the whole family. And O'Toole is the breakout new star of the movie, her Lana Lang is far superior to Margot Kidder's Lois Lane and the relationship that she has with Clark is far more believable and ""real"" than the relationship Lane has with Superman. She brings out a truly romantic aspect of Clark Kent, that given different circumstances ten years earlier, they would have married and lived happily ever after. Oh and she is by far the HOTTEST Lana Lang ever! This is not a bad movie, maybe not the great epic of the first film, or the non-stop action of the second, but it certainly has merits of its own. In 1983 Christopher Reeve gave and interview to OMNI magazine in which he said, ""I hope Superman III makes it - it's two hours where you can check your problems at the door."" And it succeeded.God Bless!",Superman III
144,Dock-Ock,Lesters Baby: The cleverest of the soar-away Superman movies,8,21 May 2001,"Making the third Superman movie something of a comedy works in my opinion. Because this way the movie is kept fresh. I cant understand why people have had a problem with the comedy elements, because Superman III does tell a very entertaining and exciting tale, and all credit must go to David and Leslie Newman, and first and for most the main man Richard Lester. The Film starts off well enough. A slapstick opening adds to the fun and sets the tone of what is to follow. This is refreshing in comparison with the openings of the other Superman movies, and unexpected. Anyhow if you miss the outer space  credits, the movie ends with them. Richard Pryor, is funny and likeable as Gus Gorman. This again is due to Lester, i would imagine. Robert Vaugn is no substitute for Gene Hackman, but does O.K. Annete O Toole is slightly cliched as Lana Lang, but again is acceptable. The real star of the show though, and this is obvious, is the man who keeps the whole thing together, Christopher Reeve as Superman. Anyone whoever plays the role in the future is going to be compared with him and rightly so. He is irreplaceable. The movies finest sequence is the junkyard battle between the good Superman and the evil Superman. Again straight out of a comic book and again all credit to Richard Lester. If you are apalled by Superhero movies that dont take themselves serious stay away from this movie [and dont read this review] otherwise enjoy what is the most fun of all the Superman movies.",Superman III
145,metzelmax,If you expect a comic book movie you might be disappointed but it is a nice comedy instead,7,1 April 2020,Recent comic book movies have gotten way to serious. People forget that a guy who flies around in his underwear is inherently a silly concept and should not be attempted to go dark and gritty.This movie is often hated because it doesn't take anything serious. Which is obvious from the start that is one prolonged slap stick gag.But that's why it is my favorite Superman movie. It remembers that you can have fun in movies rather then mope around all day.,Superman III
146,konover,Reeve makes yet another strong showing,8,22 February 2003,"Superman III is among the better black sheep super hero movie sequels.At has been mentioned many time, having Superman sharing the lead with Richard Pryor was just an excuse to cash in on Pryor's popularity and his desire to star in a Superman movie. Therefore, the story idea in general is definitely awkward and a misfire. But, the script, production values and good performances make the story work better than it should have.First of all, Christopher Reeve is yet again on target as Superman and Clark Kent. He looks great physically as the Man of Steel and gives the most mature portrayal in the series. Clark is still a bumbling reporter, but Kent's mild-mannered ways flow more smoothly than ever before. Superman is written a bit more cynically in this movie, (i.e. ""If I had a nickel for everytime a little kid asked me...""), which was a so-so decision. At the same time, it's refreshing to see Superman not smiling all the time. Watching him jump into the drama with furrowed eyebrows and ordering people around when a chemical plant is about to permeate the eastern U.S. is definitely cool.In addition, Reeve plays a frightening evil Superman during some of the film's more interesting segments. In short, nobody, to this day, has embodied a superhero more effectively than Reeve.Second, the Smallville sequences are marvelously well done and are probably the best written moments of the film. Third, the supporting cast fill their roles nicely. Now that ""Smallville"" has proven a great show, it's cool to see Annette O'Toole, who will eventually play Mrs. Kent in ""Smallville"", playing Lana Lang in this movie. Richard Pryor is fun to watch and he also made me laugh. True, his presence in the film was seemingly out of place, but he still won me over.
The regulars---Lois Lane, Perry White and Jimmy Olsen---are welcome as the returning trio in the Daily Planet. My main complaint is that I would've preferred to see Jimmy grow up a little since this is the third film.Fourth, although the script lacked the epic feel of the first two films, the dialogue accomplished what it wanted to and the flying effects never looked better. As a side note, the other cool thing about this movie is that it correctly predicted the domination of computers years before it proved true.About the one thing that really sticks out badly in this movie is the lack of a worthy Supervillain. They should've brought in Brainiac or Metallo, who are some of Superman's cooler enemies in the comics. I love Robert Vaughn, but his Ross Webster was too straight for the main villain in a superhero movie. For a main villain, he should've been written with more eccentric qualities, ala Lex Luthor. The supercomputer was not bad, but it would've worked better as a secondary villain or obstacle.
All in all, SIII is  flawed, but entertaining in its own right and is best viewed when not comparing it to its predecessors. I'll take Superman III over most of the Batman films, except maybe Batman Returns.",Superman III
147,TruPretender,Stupifyingly Awful film which shouldn't have been made.,1,8 April 2004,"No joke. this film was a piece of garbage. Trying to stray from what Donner wanted to a Superman image, the producers of the Superman films went with Richard Lester in this mish mash of a sequel that pits the man of steel against nimrods who want to take over the satellite that orbits the earth so they can control weather(!) Whilst the man of steel is caught up in trying to unite with his not so high school sweetie Lana Lang, portrayed horribly by Annette O Toole. Bad action sequences contribute to the pile of garbage this film has going for it-which begins in the first few minutes! The film starts with a stupid flap jack, slap stick sequence that has no business being in a Superman film, and goes on to bringing the audience to the Daily Planet, where the audience is SO CRUSHED to learn the truth: Margot Kidder will not be in this film! And then it is off to the heavens of insanity and away we go(Oh no!) Avoid this film like the plague! Thank fully, the Salkinds followed this film up with ""Supergirl"" a redeeming film that brought this series back to snuff for on more try. 0/10",Superman III
148,epatters-3,I think it is OK,6,6 June 2008,"Not the best superhero movie you will ever see. This movie, in some ways, it turns into a Richard Pryor comedy. If you are expecting a masterpiece, then you are going to be disappointed. The good: 1.Christopher Reeve does a good job. 2. Good special effects. 3.I like the Superman turning evil part, that was kinda cool. 4.I liked the fight scene with Clark and evil superman. 5.I thought that the scene where the woman turns into this robot was cool. 6.It did have a interesting premise. The Bad: 1.The dialogue is not very good. 2.It is not as good as the first 2 films. 3.Even though I thought the robot scene was cool, I thought that it made it seem like a horror movie and less like a superhero movie. Overall:It is an okay film. Not the best of the 5 movies but it is better then Superman 4:The quest for peace. It is my 4th favorite of the series. My overall rating for Richard Lester's Superman III is 6 out of 10 stars.",Superman III
149,zach-69,Third times a charm!,10,14 December 2006,"This third installment was hysterical, thanks to Richard Pryor and just flat out fun, thanks to Annette O' Toole who also plays Clark Kent's (Tom Welling) adoptive mother on the Superman t.v. series and MY favorite t.v. series, Smallville. I thought that the blonde was just flat out annoying! I liked the villains though. But, the best for me was being able to see Christopher Reeve and Annette O'Toole together back in 1983! Christopher Reeve cannot be replaced! Bryan Singer who directed Superman Returns which came out in 2006 didn't know what he was doing when he casted Brandon Routh who looks like Dean Cain from Lois and Clark: Then New Adventures of Superman as Clark Kent and Superman! He bares on resemblance to Reeve! Tom Welling who plays Clark Kent, and only Clark Kent right now on Smallville is the spitting image of Christopher Reeve, he should have been cast! Not only that but, like I said, Annette was Lana in Superman three with Chris, Terrence Stamp who played General Zod in Superman and Superman 2 provides the voice of Jor-El on Smallville and does a wonderful job at it.

150,thatsweetbird,Finally saw this for first time after all these years,3,12 April 2019,"For those rating this a ""10"" I have to wonder did they actually see this movie? HehNot unwatchable because you still have some charismatic actors in this,
But really what were they trying to accomplish with this other than spitting out a Superman movie?
As It made money so they were probably happy with this.I see some reviews defending this as more ""cartoonish"" and Yes it is,
But is that what this series needed?
I understand the""science"" in this can't be expected to be totally plausible-
But the ideas and""logic"" in this is what I'd expect from kids on a playground-
Not adults writing a movie for those kids and the rest of us.And Not that I'm traumatized heh
But I also did not see why we need to have it implied that Superman screws the heavy's girlfriend
While he's supposedly an evil version of himself-
Especially in the middle of such an as mentioned ""cartoonish"" movie.Some odd but not interestingly odd choices in this script. Heh",Superman III
151,gravity3,what were they thinking?,1,14 July 2003,"You know, Richard Pryor can be a very funny comedic actor. And Christopher Reeve is the definitive Superman actor in my book. I don't want to criticize either actor because they're both great in their own right. But what madman decided these 2 style concepts could go together? For years ""comic"" books adapted into films and TV usually had a high camp and rather cheesy look about them. I think this was largely due to the misunderstanding producers and screenwriters had for the medium, and the lack of respect for the art form.Then we got the first of this Superman series, and it changed everything. Someone actually came close to getting the writing style right, and put the grandeur comics always strove for into a movie. ""Superman 2"" largely continued this feel and look. But I guess someone got bored with the genre and decided to mix it up. Who knows, What we ended up with, is one of the worst sequels to anything, and certainly one of the worst films of the 80's. (I say this in context with how good the first 2 of the series were, and what comics in this style are supposed to be about.)I guess this is a common theme for sequels. By the third installment, you've gotten so far away from the concept it's unrecognizable (""Jaws 3-D"" comes to mind). It's just too bad so many talented people showed up to work on this waste of film. Come to think of it, the same fate befell the Batman franchise, the last of which (""Batman and Robin"") challenges Superman III for worst ever.Now I'm not going to say that someone couldn't possibly enjoy this movie in some context. Folks like all sorts of things (thank God). It just doesn't have anything to do with the previous films aside from some of the castmembers, and so on that level it completely fails. Let's hope the Spider-Man sequels do better - at least Mr. Raimi's a Spidey fan.",Superman III
152,KnightLander,The first of two extremely weak sequels,4,18 March 2006,"I'll be frank: SUPERMAN III is NOT a good film. Having heard both from people who loved the movie and hated the movie, I watched it with an open mind, but in the end it was clear to me that this movie is weak. Very weak.Half of the movie revolves around Gus Gorman (Richard Pryor!), a dim-witted computer programmer who becomes involved in crime when he begins working for millionaire Ross Webster (Robert Vaughn). The other half of the film revolves around Superman (Christopher Reeve), as he is reunited with high school sweetheart Lana Lang (Annette O'Toole) and becomes evil when exposed to synthetic kryptonite.One can't help but wonder what David and Leslie Newman, who co-wrote the previous two SUPERMAN films, were thinking when they wrote this film. It opens with a cringe-worthy slapstick sequence, and gets worse from there. Any and all scenes involving Richard Pryor are completely out of place in this film, making it seem more like an unfunny comedy than a superhero film. Director Richard Lester tries his best to make the movie work, but ultimately, it doesn't, thanks in part to the absence of Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor and the near-absence of Margot Kidder as Lois Lane (Kidder has a total of about three minutes on-screen). Christopher Reeve, however, is excellent as always, and Annette O'Toole is a good fit for the part of Lana Lang; interestingly, she portrayed Clark's mother, Martha Kent, on the hit Superman TV series SMALLVILLE.SUPERMAN III is mediocre at best, a failed attempt to continue an excellent series. While it couldn't hold my attention for the 125 minute runtime, I can think of worse movies to watch late at night with a bowl of popcorn and a Coke. Superman fans may want to check it out; all others, steer clear.",Superman III
153,jeopardyrobot-41055,Badness,4,27 December 2019,"It's terrible. Pryor is unlikable. The bad guy is lame and I'm still not sure what his deal is. When Superman goes bad it's kind of cool. Serve does a great job in those bits. Oh and the superman video game looks the biz, but overall it's just nonsense",Superman III
154,Lori S,A disappointment that makes you squirm,3,2 March 2001,"There are some redeeming qualities which saves this movie from being as awful as ""Superman IV"":  the Rube Goldberg-esque sequence in the beginning of the film (where one mishap causes another & things get worse); the charming courtship between Lana & Clark (for a change, Lana really likes Clark but doesn't care much for Superman); and when Superman's evil twin starts doing naughty things like flick peanuts at windows to break them, or straighten the Tower of Pisa, I think he even comes on to Lana!  But it's not enough to save the entire movie from being an embarrassment:  the writers & director have overemphasized the comedy, casting not only a lame Richard Pryor (who lost his sharp wit after he almost torched himself), but also a typical blonde bimbo as the villain's mistress, and the guy who plays Lana's drunk ex-husband. And Lana's kid is such a pain you wanna slap him! The production values are cheaper, due to a slashed budget.  Reeve and Annette O'Toole as Lana give nice performances, but the film is quite average, a far cry from ""Superman I"" and ""II"".  Too bad",Superman III
155,theojhyman,Christopher Reeve saves Superman III,8,22 March 2000,"The second sequel was directed entirely by Richard Lester, and it shows - it's all comedy, in fact almost a spoof. Richard Pryor's quite funny in it, Robert Vaughn's alright, but this time, Margot Kidder is left out (blame the producers again). Fortunately, Annette O'Toole is excellent as Lana Lang, and all the scenes with her and Reeve are the best. Both the romantic and serious parts of the movie are excellent, but the movie is overrun by farcical comedy, making it more of a Richard Pryor comedy than a Superman movie. Fortunately, the 'true' Superman (Christopher Reeve) saves this movie from destruction - he is so great, really adding dimension to both characters, whilst also successfully playing a third character - an evil Superman - in one of the best scenes of the film. Reeve saves this movie completely and makes it hugely enjoyable, although not half as good as the first (making $60 million in the USA in 1983, compared to Superman I's $135 million in 1978).",Superman III
156,supercygnus,Super-Underrated,8,29 November 2006,"In truth, although I personally enjoyed Superman III and I scored it an ""8"", it probably lies somewhere closer to 7.5. What has become the major criticism has been a focus not on what the film was, but what it could have been. This is truly unfair to the finished product as SUPERMAN III did have a lot to offer and remains quite entertaining today. Please read on as I qualify a statement that may be viewed a blasphemous among many fans.First let's get something straight. The film was not a ""bomb"". It made less than the first 2, however part II made less than part I, and yet is considered a strong film whatever cut of it you see. Part III made less, but was still very successful. Second, part III is attacked for 2 reasons. The first is of course the lack of DONNER and his influences (director Richard Donner of the first film and part of the second). Yes, it is indeed sad that we will never know how far he could taken the series had he not been so unceremoniously canned; however that is something we cannot change or know and Part III is it's own animal and should be judged thusly. True, it does suffer some major drawbacks. There is real lack of spark without Lois around and the humor is very overpowering in many spots (the opening for example is entertaining, but completely off tone for the franchise). It does however benefit from a wonderful Lana Lang (the still very beautiful and active Superman actress in the current Smallville series, Annette O'Toole), a fun and unpredictable battle with a supercomputer, the ever reliable Reeve as Superman once again, and a scene which should be considered one of the greatest scenes in ANY superhero film, good Supes vs. Bad. That scene alone warrants a viewing.The second complaint is with co-star Richard Pryor. Anyone who has seen BATMAN and Nicholson's dominance of screen time, or even the first SUPERMAN must acknowledge that SUPERMAN III is not the only film to focus at least as much on the villain (if not more so) as they do the hero. It is sometimes distracting the extent they focus on Pryor in the film, but he also brings both a lightly villainous but also strong sense of humanity to a part that could have simply have been just a forgettable henchman. There was a distinct overuse of his character, but he by no means sinks the film. It should also be pointed out that the first 2 films (I rank, as do many others as some of the best Superhero films ever made) also had their flaws both in continuity (if Krypton had been destroyed thousands of years earlier, how then does the education in the crystals on the way to Earth reference 20th Century information for example) and logic (so it's just mere coincidence that tossing a nuclear bomb/missile into the vastness of space would just happen to explode a phantom zone prison floating around from Kyrpton?) and even Donner's work was occasionally improved by the choices made by Lester (his contributions to the franchise are a real injustice on their own as he is also an immensely talented filmmaker). Of course the third is no where near the shear wonder of parts 1 and 2, but it does stand well on it's own as a side adventure outside the first two films' mythology and despite it's shortcomings features some truly memorable effects, action and of course legendary Christopher Reeve playing not just dual, but a trio of roles. Worth a watch for sure.",Superman III
157,darthquincunx,Goddamn awful!,1,30 May 2005,"Well I'm going to rip this film to pieces. 1)The Vulcan satellite: A satellite does not create weather! Also the satellite is sent out to outer space to look for kryptonite. There's no way a satellite can leave orbit just on the order of a computer instruction. 2) The analysis of the kryptonite showed plutonium, a man-made element and xenon which is a gas. The other elements in that list don't exist. Besides plutonium is radioactive and I can't see how some chemists could produce that crystal! They would instantly say it was dangerous! 3) The rocket defence system for the master computer. How on earth did they install that without the knowledge of the authorities? It would have taken months do install! 4) When the master computer draws power you see an overhead shot of North America largely in darkness as the lights go out. Yet where the master computer is it is still daylight and when Superman goes to the chemical plant to get a container of the corrosive acid it is still daylight 5) How can you turn a tornado from under the cloud to be above the cloud?

158,EJBaggaley,Superman vs. Clark Kent ?,8,5 November 2004,"When I first viewed this film as a child, I hated it, but when I saw the film years later I soon changed my mind. Although this film did go down-hill after the 'Clark Kent vs. Superman' scene in the junkyard, I thought this film had a good storyline to it. Not only the acting was good (especially by Christopher Reeve) for when he turned from 'good to evil' but I found this film humorous and exciting in every way as Richard Pryor contributed mostly towards the humour side. Although I liked this movie there were some aspects in it that didn't make sense, like why did Dennis Hopper and his crew tried to kill Superman after he turned evil as he wasn't a problem to them at that point. Also how they use the same actors in different roles thinking that the viewers wouldn't realise it.(ie. The weedy Policeman from Houston in Superman 2,was the same actor in Superman 3, who had cash spitting out at him at the cash-point machine in New York) but then again this has happened a few times in all the Superman films.Something else I figured out in this film that not all viewers may have noticed is that Lona's son Ricky mat have saved Supermans life. This is because after the scene when Superman left the pub drunk and little Ricky was shouting out to him saying how how he believed in him and how he'd be great again - as those words stuck in his mind when he was flying away, I think that somewhat softened the evil Superman which then forced Clark Kent - his remaining goodness within him to exit his body in the junkyard and thereafter battling one another. So if Ricky wasn't there to encourage the Superman, then Superman would have probably perished.As a film thats different from the other Superman films (ie. without Lois Lane, Perry whites Office and Lex Luthor) I thought this film carried itself quite well. The reason why this film may have had bad ratings is because the viewers are too narrow minded to accept a sequel thats different from what they're used to. Apart from this the scene in the junkyard with Superman vs. Clark Kent was probably one of the most spectacular scenes in the whole Superman trilogy which also says a lot for how good this film was. Despite a few minor errors in this film, I think this Superman sequel is a classic, for the acting was good, it special effects were okay and it had a great plot.",Superman III
159,firstruleofmethclub,"The first ""bad"" Superman film, but not the worst",2,17 April 2015,"The Superman franchise changed hands again with the release of III. A move which aggravated a lot of cast, crew, and fans. Christopher Reeve was disappointed in the series' new direction, but not so much as to turn down the paycheque of another role. Margot Kidder's negative reaction gained her a back seat in the film, and Gene Hackman left the piece altogether. Though there's plenty to be said about Christopher Reeve's acting ability, as he plays Clark Kent, Superman and a darker, uncaring version of Superman, all in the one film with vigour; this is essentially all Superman has going for it by this stage. Richard Pryor is out of place in the DC universe, making slapstick terror and taking up nearly as much screen time as the Man of Steel himself (much to my chagrin). Robert Vaughn's Ross Webster makes for a poor Luthor substitute. Lana Lang's insertion as a love interest was completely disrespectful to the effort that had been put in with the first two films, making Superman's sacrifices and emotions all but redundant. There's very little new material in the piece, and everything that is new, is for the worse. The end result is a cheap disappointment that should never have been made, whose only saving grace is it's titular character. which the film severely under uses in favour of boring sideline exposition and pointless, deranged silliness. 21%-Gimly",Superman III
160,blackcircles,Reeve's crowning moment. Too bad it's not a good movie.,5,7 July 2000,"The drastic drop in quality after the first two Superman films is a real shame. As a kid, I enjoyed the Superman films even more than the Star Wars movies, and about a year ago I took the time to view all four movies once again. Superman III is still a bad film, but that scene where Clark Kent battles the evil Superman is unforgettable! If anyone needs convincing that Christopher Reeve is a great actor, the only proof that is needed is that scene. Unfortunately it is surrounded on both sides by a lame film. If this scene were edited out and released as a short film, I'd rate it a 10. Superman's brutalization of Clark is incredibly frightening, but the way Clark gains more and more strength after every blow is incredibly inspiring and heroic. If you've never seen Superman III, it's worth checking out simply for this scene. Reeve has never been better.",Superman III
161,burbs82,"""I hope you don't expect me to save you...""",10,28 November 2006,"Despite the overwhelming hatred for Superman III, I gotta say that I think it's an excellent film. One of the two best of the whole Superman saga, actually. The other, of course, is the original film. But Superman III is so much fun, and a great example of how it's possible for Superman to have enemies OTHER than Lex Luthor. The guy's been the main villain in, how many is it, FOUR of the now FIVE Superman films? I liked Gene Hackman's Luthor (far superior to Kevin Spacey's), but you gotta take a break at some point. No, Superman III is a refreshing change of pace, not only in that respect, but in several ways.Most noticeable, and much to the chagrin of many people, is the slightly more comedic tone of the film, centered mainly around Richard Pryor's character, August 'Gus' Gorman. I thought Prior was great. He plays an over-the-top character in a movie series about an over-the-top character. I hear people complain all the time that they hate the comedy that Prior brought to the film because Superman is supposed to be, and these are actual quotes, ""gritty"" and ""realistic"". NO, he's not. Superman is not gritty, and he's not realistic. Never was, never will be. Richard Donner's original doesn't even come CLOSE to playing it straight. Just look at how he portrays Clark Kent. In the comic books and 1950's television series, the ""mild-mannered"" Clark Kent is treated with respect and professionalism. He basically co-exists amongst his peers at the Daily Planet. In ""Superman: The Movie"", Richard Donner has taken the character straight out of the old comics and TV series, with all the same mannerisms and morals, and placed him in a very modern 1978. This is a set-up for much of the films adequate amount of comedy relief. ""Superman: The Movie"" is not a comedy. Neither is ""Superman III"", but they both have comic relief. The Clark Kent character is slightly more serious in this one, thus, you have Gus. A funny little man, with an interesting power. A savant-like intellect that gives him complete control over any computer system.I especially like how Clark Kent, Superman's alterego, is fleshed out more as he returns home to Smallville. This is a great follow-up to Richard Donner's brief exploration to Superman's early years in Smallville. The inclusion of Lana Lang as Clark's high school crush was great, even better in that they chose the lovely Annette O'Toole to portray the character. I LOVE Margot Kidder, but I think Lana is a very important character in Superman's backstory.All the delving into Clark Kent's character and background leads us to one of the greatest scenes in motion picture history... Clark Kent vs. Evil Superman. I could sit here and expound on the scene's metaphoric implications all day long, but simply put, I found it jaw-dropping. Christopher Reeve was always perfect as Superman, but his best work is here in this scene. Evil Superman is a very physical representation of everything Clark/Superman has ever repressed, and obviously we're talking about a lot of repression here. It's great stuff. I still wanna cheer every time the victorious Clark Kent opens his shirt to reveal his famous insignia, which, by the way, is differentiated by Evil Superman's in that it's excessively bright, where as his was really dark and dingy looking. Having been a Superman fan since I was a kid way back in the day, that's one of those scenes I'll remember 'till the day I die. I remember it from my childhood, but it's actually more relateable for me now as an adult.Superman III is one of the greats. If you haven't seen it yet, I only ask that you watch it with an open mind and not look for grit or realism where it has no place being. Instead, just believe a man can fly... again.",Superman III

I was only 5 years old at the time, and thought Superman was the perfect gentleman until this. I watched the film from start to finish, and was more comfortable with the early moments of the movie. Parts like when Gus Gorman was pulling the drunken body of Brad to hook up the PC, knowing that Gus needed both hands simultaneously...funny. And also when Gus was making light chit-chat with the boss Ross Webster. One particular scene I thought was funny was when Ross' sister Vera came down to join her brother and Gus commented ""You didn't tell me your mother was gonna be here"" it got a big laugh from the audience. Other than that nothing else really enchanted me from this film. Moving on to the Superman versus a human-like Clark Kent was very tight and dramatic. The only real spark the film had to offer. Superman had become a womanizer or cad and through guilt created his alter ego and knew he had to destroy it. Note that during their battle, Superman became a bit weaker while Kent gained invicibility. Most people believed the ""Man of Steel"" changed because of some bogus chunk of kryptonite, however, if studied properly, Superman changed on his own free will. The fake green stuff was just an excuse to make him do it. Realizing that the stuff didn't kill him, Superman felt that nothing may be able to harm him anymore. He felt to be more potent than ever. Superman then decided to act up merely because he had nothing else better to do, and was feeling bored. Being the bad guy ""for once"" added some spice to his life...think about it and you will agree with me.",Superman III

169,ar87,"A great movie, very enjoyable",10,16 August 2001,"My rating - 4/5 stars CONTAINS SPOILERS Superman III was fully directed by Richard Lester. The script, written by David and Leslie Newman, focused more on comedy than any of the other Superman movies, hence the casting of comedian Richard Pryor, as computer genius Gus Gorman. Released in 1983, Superman III did pretty good in the box office, but received pretty lousy reviews, mostly because the reviewers tended to compare it to the first 2 superb films. Superman III doesn't exactly have a comedic tone (not counting the beginning credits) but it has a comedic person, Gus Gorman. Reviewers tended to only look at him campy humor (except for a few funny scenes) and judge the film solely on that. Superman III definitely had the best flying FX out of all four Super films, because of the large budget, and the technology advances at that point. The plot definitely relates to today's world more than any of the other movies. Although some of the commands Gus Gorman types in the computer are pretty silly (like override all security).A major highlight of the film is the evil Superman: Gus Gorman uses the Vulcan satellite to examine various pieces of Kryptonite debris floating in space. The chemical analysis shows that there is one unknown element in the kryptonite. The ""genius"" Gus Gorman types in tar as the unknown, not realizing that it is UNKNOWN because there is no element known to Earth like that, and obviously tar IS known. The kryptonite is created, and Gorman manages to plant it on Superman. To Gus' dismay, the kryptonite seems to have no effect on Superman. Later, however, a truck is teetering off of a bridge. Superman doesn't save it, figuring that he always gets there in time anyway, and asks Lana Lang to sit down with him. He comes back to his senses later, but it too late - the truck has already fallen. Superman goes on an ""evil"" streak, putting the Leaning Tower of Pisa straight, blowing out the Olympic torch, that just happens to be being passed on that very day.  He breaks open an oil tanker, gets drunk at a bar, and then finally looses it in a junkyard, where a huge imaginary battle occurs between ""the evil Superman"" and Clark Kent. Clark wins of course, and fixes everything again.The Lana Lang/Clark Kent scenes are great, with good chemistry between the two. Unfortunately, due to the firing of Richard Donner, Margot Kidder was only onscreen in what could be considered a cameo.Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) left, and was replaced by the evil Ross Webster (Robert Vaughn). Webster plans to use Gus Gorman, computer genius, to do his dirty work for him. Webster controls the price of coffee beans in various countries, but apparently Columbia won't give in to him. Gorman uses the Vulcan weather satellite to create huge rain storms and tornadoes, in an effort to wipe away Columbia's coffee. Superman foils their plan. Webster's new plan is to kill Superman, so that he can go about his other plans, like stopping people from getting oil. Gorman proposes that they build a computer, that will do anything that he tells it to do, and that can find anybody's weakness, and destroy them. In the end, Superman manages to destroy the computer. Gorman was let off, and Webster, Vera Webster, and Lorelei Ambrosia were thrown in jail.The end was nice, with Superman crushing a piece of coal into a diamond, and then giving Lana the diamond as Clark (but saying that it was from Superman), because she had to pawn her last diamond ring to pay for her heating bill. After that, Lana gets a job in the Daily Planet as a secretary (but is missing from the IVth installment) and Superman pushes the now not Leaning Tower of Pisa back into shape.This was a great sequel, and although some may say it revolves around comedy, they're only thinking of about 15 minutes out of the entire 125 minutes (theatrical version) of the movie. 4 stars!",Superman III

172,timcarter152,A Super-mixed bag,5,7 November 2007,"To follow up my lambasting of ""Superman 4: The Quest for Peace"", I'll write a review, my 17th for IMDb, of the third installment in the franchise. The Positives: -Christopher Reeve is still fantastic as both Clark Kent and Superman, and he still seems to have a lot of the charm and respectability that he had in the first two movies. Also, he manages to pull off the new ""evil Superman"", which gives him something new to do acting-wise. -Annette 'O Toole, while no Lois Lane replacement, is still very good, and she gives Lana Lang a sweetness and genuine likability that is very beneficial to the film. -Richard Pryor is funny... sometimes. -The visual effects are still very impressive, and are on par with the first two films (it fluctuates between the two). -The junkyard fight between Clark and the evil Superman is great, and is the best action sequence in the film, and the question of whether it's a real fight or a battle in Superman's makes it interesting.The Negatives: -Unfortunately, the junkyard fight is also the only good action sequence in the film. The rest of them, despite the presence of solid visual effects, were only average and dutiful at best, and struggled to hold my interest. The climactic battle, on the other hand, was terrible, with most of what was happening on screen being incredibly stupid (especially Vera being turned into a robot). -Speaking of the villains again, who were they? To be blunt, Ross Webster is barely even a second-rate Lex Luthor replacement, and his sister Vera was simply bland. And that curly blonde-haired assistant of his... god, her high pitched voice made her sound even worse than one of the chipmunks! -Richard Pryor isn't funny... sometimes. Also, the film seems to give equal screen time to Gus Gorman and Superman, and the whole film feels like an odd blend of so-so Superman movie with so-so Richard Pryor comedy. Look kids, it's Richard Pryor! On skis! Sliding down a mountain! And he can't ski! (I have the odd thought that the remake of ""Last Holiday"" with Queen Latifah ripped off this scene) -If I find the knucklehead who replaced the John Williams ""Superman"" score with bad '70s music... HULK SMASH!My 3 choice words: Okay, Supertoole, Chipmunkwoman",Superman III
173,jo007r,Watered down Man of Steel sequel.,6,21 August 2000,"Either way you look at it, this film fails to live up to its expectations. If you are wanting to watch an epic Superman adventure, you will be disappointed, if you are wanting to watch a comedy/adventure, you will also be disappointed.Superman II had enough balance of comedy, most of it funny, and action, most of it exciting, to entertain its audience members.  Yet for some reason the producers decided to go overboard on comedy in Superman III.Richard Pryor does his best to entertain audiences with all of his antics, and some of them are funny; the best is when he falls off the top of a skyscraper and lands in the street unharmed.  However the rest of the film suffers from the over abundance of the painfully misplaced comedy.  The opening sequence is the best example of this.Christopher Reeve is wonderful as Superman/Clark Kent, like always!  Here in this movie he gives his best job at portraying Clark Kent.  The scenes with him and his old girl-friend from high school, Lana Lang, are nicely executed and show the evolution of Clark Kent's character, by adding more depth and dimension, especially when the audience realizes she falls for Clark and not his alter ego.Some of the scenes are moderately entertaining, the scene with Superman taking on the chemical plant fire is amusing, but pales in comparison with his other two previous outings.  Rescuing Ricky from the combines is also another example, it almost seems that the producers decided to quit inventing ways for Superman to 'save the day' and just rehash old ideas.There is hardly any plot to this movie, viewers will eventually stumble across one about 2/3s of the way through it, and will yawn at the lack of creativity and excitement of it.  There is only one scene that will place viewers on the edge of their seats...The scene when Superman is split into two different personalities, one evil and one good, is actually very interesting to watch.  When I first saw this movie back in 1983 I was actually scared of the evil Superman!  The scene where the moral side of Superman, Clark Kent, and the evil side of Superman, the tar infected Superman, do a fight to the death in an automobile grave yard, generates lots of excitement as well as goose bumps when Clark prevails.  This scene stands alone, and the contrast Christopher Reeve gives between the two Supermen is incredible, his contributions to the scene and the movie can not be overstated.As for the rest of the movie, Robert Vaughn does well for a villain, but is no Gene Hackman.  And the finale with the 'Ultimate Computer' is rather lame.  It can be argued that the climax of Superman III is the battle between the two Supermen.The special effects are not so stunning this time around, and the wires that hold Reeve and make him fly are visible in nearly every scene!  The bluescreens are not executed so well either, one can tell that Superman is flying in front of screen rather than appear to be flying in the actual location.This film could have been so much more, even with Pryor in it.  However, poor writing and directing plague this sequel in nearly every faucet of it. It is such a shame that Christopher Reeve give an incredible performance in such a weak film.  Had this film been up to par with the other two Superman films, chances are the Superman series would not have died a slow quiet death.",Superman III
174,MARVMOOCOW,Superman III suffers from an Identity Crisis,5,19 July 2006,"When I look back at this film I truly think that a grave injustice was done with DCs biggest hero.Imagine what this film series would've been like under the direction of Richard Donner?I shudder to think what the Spiderman films will be like without Sam Raimi. By now we all know about the Superman II director swap etc so I won't go into that only to say I can't wait to see the Donner version of Superman II when its finally released. Now let's get into Superman 3.It doesn't know whether to be a comedy (the slapstick opening sequence) or a serious action film (the chemical plant)the inclusion of the late Richard Pryor doesn't help either and while I am a fan of Pryors work I think he's out of place in this film it's not that he doesn't put in a good performance its just that this film was not the right vehicle to showcase his talents. Like many previous reviewers have said this film sorely lacks the presence of a strong villain and you wonder what it would've been had Hackman returned as Lex Luthor and the character of Lois Lane had returned longer than a 5 minute cameo,even if they had recast the role it would've been better.Don't get me wrong Lana Lang is a big part of the Superman mythos and deserves to be in the film series somewhere.I don't know I just think that the producers and studios thinking people would go see this film no matter what decided to rush it through development. The film does have its good points though. Christopher Reeve will always be Superman to me(although George Reeves is also great in the role)and once again puts in a great performance despite a poor script. The Superman turned bad plot showed some promise and the whole Smallville thing was good,it shows the contrasts between Clark and Supes,Lois loves Superman Lana loves Clark. Its still an enjoyable flick to pass the time and well worth the watch.",Superman III
175,webslinger-00280,A Spit In the Face of Christopher Reeve's Legacy,3,22 June 2021,"I found this movie to be a completely atrocious embarrassment of a film. It was overly comical in all the wrong ways, had so many unrelated storylines that made it feel like I was watching multiple films and made my head spin, and did nothing but poorly copy the first film. If you're a fan of Superman and are interested in watching Christopher Reeve's films, I highly suggest that you skip this one and treat it like it doesn't exist. It not only disrespects you as a viewer, but also Reeve as an actor. You have been warned.",Superman III
176,col_rutherford,The Man of Steel Gets Rusty,2,14 June 2003,"At some point during ""Superman III"", a little boy tells a strangely out of character Superman that he's ""just in a slump"". Audiences will probably say the same thing. After really enjoying the first two ""Superman"" movies, ""Superman III"" comes as a big disappointment. As directed by ""Superman II's"" Richard Lester, it makes a misguided turn towards campy comedy, while the screenplay by David and Leslie Newman simply serves as a vehicle for two popular icons of the early 1980s: comedian Richard Pryor and the computer.Pryor plays an otherwise ordinary man who discovers an uncanny talent for computer programming. He's recruited by an unscrupulous industrialist (Robert Vaughn) to aid plans to dominate the world's economy. At the same time, Clark Kent (Christopher Reeve) visits his hometown of Smallville and is reunited with his high school crush Lana Lang (Annette O'Toole). When Superman interferes in the bad guys' schemes, they attempt to synthesize Kryptonite to destroy him, but they get the formula wrong and the resulting compound instead alters the Man of Steel's personality (much like the Red Kryptonite from the old comic books did).""Superman III"" goes wrong on many different levels. Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor is absent and Margot Kidder's Lois Lane only has a cameo. Vaughn's okay, but Annie Ross is one dimensional as his haggish sister and Pamela Stephenson is annoying as a ""psychic nutritionist"" who may not be the blonde bimbo she appears to be. As for Pryor, he's simply miscast and has no place being in a ""Superman"" picture. Pryor's racy stand up act usually gets toned down for film and here he's reduced to silly pratfalls. I wouldn't have minded the greater emphasis on comedy if most of the jokes were funny (watch ""Star Trek IV"" as an example of how to do it right), but much of the humour in ""Superman III"" is forced and out of place. An opening sequence involving a slapstick chain of accidents belongs in a ""Keystone Kops"" episode.""Superman III"" does have a few saving graces. Christopher Reeve gives another good performance as the title character, even when the script lets him down. Reeve is also convincing portraying Superman's evil split personality. I don't want to give the movie's high point away, but there's a technically impressive fight sequence in a junkyard that brings a touch of darkness and psychological complexity to a movie otherwise lacking in it. O'Toole also provides a pleasant alternative love interest for the Man of Steel. Just like in the comics, Lana prefers Clark as he is while Lois only had eyes for Superman. There are also some decent action sequences, like when Superman puts out a chemical plant fire, but I found the climactic fight against the villains' giant super-computer to be nothing more than an ad for an Atari video game. Unfortunately for all, ""Superman III"" marked the beginning of the end for a once great movie franchise.3 out of 10.",Superman III
177,guyhayder,A strange movie,6,25 August 2020,This was a different type of Superman movie.The most thing that wasn't right was Superman having a dark side and doing bad things.

178,GreenGoblinsOckVenom86,Horrible excuse for a Superman movie!,1,18 July 2015,What were they thinking when they made this? This movie barely focuses on Superman and mainly focuses on Richard Pryor acting like an unfunny idiot. Also even though Richard Pryor seems to have no experience using a computer he somehow gets hired to do payroll on a computer. Not only that but he intentionally does it wrong and gives everyone more money than he should. Instead of being angry about this his boss actually likes that he did this. Seriously? That is dumb! Also who the heck wants to see a Superman movie with a plot point about someone doing payroll? There are maybe a few scenes with Superman that are entertaining but Superman/Clark Kent is not focused on enough. This movie spends way more time on comedian Richard Pryor than it does on Superman. The villains in this movie are not even from the comics. Some say the giant robot at the end is supposed to be Braniac but having read old comics with him that is a bunch of bolony. Frankly this whole movie feels like it was originally supposed to be a Richard Pryor comedy and then they added in Superman at the last second. Some might like the scene of Superman turning bad then turning into 2 different people but frankly I think that's really confusing and don't care for it. Anyway this movie is awful and I don't get how any sane person could like it.,Superman III
179,JimmyG100,"Campy, but fun",5,6 July 2005,"Superman and Superman II were two excellent examples of how a superhero movie should be. Excellent story, true drama, great performances. Superman III, however, takes a different approach to the legendary character. Not necessarily bad, but a little less serious than the Donner films and more of a focus on fun. Try to think of this film as kind of the story of an actual comic of Superman out of the 1960's. It isn't anything deep about Supes Kryptonian origins or furthering his love with Lois, it's just Superman off on another adventure facing a new evil villain along with Richard Pryor. It's pure meaningless fun that works pretty well and it is a definite recommendation to complete the Supes trilogy (but word of advise, stop at III, don't bother with IV or you'll just be disappointed)",Superman III
180,IrishWriter34,"Forget kryptonite, you can kill Superman with a bad movie!",2,23 May 2002,"Not long ago, I wrote my ideas as to what SUPERMANs III and IV should have been for Superman Cinema's fan-fic section. My version of SUPERMAN III picked up where the last film left off, with the relationship between Lois and Clark/Superman dead and gone. In it, Lana Lang returns to rekindle her relationship with Clark while a pair of insane government scientists mass-produce Bizarros for use as a disposable army. Spurned on the basis that such an army would violate human rights, the scientists use the Bizarros to wreak havoc upon Washington and end up in direct conflict with Superman.Why am I telling you this? Because what I came up with was way better than the actual SUPERMAN III. It's no secret that the Salkinds originally intended the SUPERMAN films to be camp comedies, a plan that Richard Donner and Tom Mankiewicz undid when they made SUPERMAN as a dramatic film. Even though both men had been fired from SUPERMAN II after filming 80% of the picture and replaced by Richard Lester and the Newmans (who rewrote and reshot much of the final film, and are the ""masterminds"" behind III), enough of Donner and Mankiewicz's influence was stamped into the film to keep it from being totally screwed up. With SUPERMAN III, Donner and Mankiewicz's influence is completely absent, and we finally see what the Salkinds intended the SUPERMAN series to be all along. And what we get is a campy, dumb, and unfunny insult to the mythos. Not even the superb FX work, a good rescue scene at a chemical plant, and Robert Paynter's comic book-panel photography can make this film feel like genuine Superman.It's not the idea of having Richard Pryor in a Superman film that makes this film bad, or using Lana Lang. It's not even the idea of using new villains. What makes this film bad is the sheer carelessness and idiocy of it all. For a film that revolves around computers as a menace, the villain should have been Brainiac, the genocidal AI of the comic books. Instead we get Robert Vaughn and Annie Ross as greedy tycoons who sucker a computer wiz into helping them corner the commodities market. Not very exciting. Instead of giving Pryor a meaty, serious role that would have tested him as an actor and have fit into the tone of the Superman mythos, we get Pryor as Gus Gorman doing standard Pryor shtick and not being funny at all. Instead of Lana Lang having some zest and excitement to her, we get a very bland and dull character played by a very boring Annette O'Toole. It also doesn't help that Pamela Stephenson's Lorelai character is beyond annoying, that Lois Lane barely appears in this movie at all (the Salkinds were punishing Margot Kidder for openly sticking up for Donner), that none of the plot threads are remotely satisfying, that Superman is now a bit player in his own movie, that Ken Thorne's abysmal and boring score continues to reduce John Williams' powerful fanfares to shrill and campy disgraces, that Richard Lester's disdain for Superman shows in his indifferent direction, and that the acting is all-around awful. Even when Superman ISN'T evil (and the ""Superman goes evil and fights himself"" scene is the lowest point in the film), Christopher Reeve comes off as smarmy and insincere (probably because he realizes the film sucks). And let's not forget the horrible slapstick gags, which are totally out of place here. And why does Metropolis have such a strongly British feel to it in the opening sequence? Shouldn't it be more American? Shades of SUPERMAN II's Idaho residents with British accents....I can't say that this is as low as the SUPERMAN films can sink; the upcoming Jon Peters-produced SUPERMAN movie promises to be even worse. But of the Christopher Reeve cycle, this is by far the worst of the four. To those who assert that this film is truer to the comic books than the first two, I beg to differ. The first two films are kin to the best Superman comic stories. III is kin to the absolute worst.",Superman III
181,tomfarrellmedia,Look Up.....Is it a Bore? Is it a Pain? Yes it's all those and worse....,1,6 September 2007,"Picture this: The year is 1983. Girls Just Wanna Have Fun is drifting from the radio and Dynasty is on the TV. A wide-eyed child sits in the cinema, having been vowed by the two Superman epics of 1978 and 1980...the apocalyptic death of Krypton, the baby lifting the truck in Smallville, Clark's bumbling crush on Lois, General Zod's defiant screams at an emasculated Son of Jor-El, Metropolis a battleground...ahhhh, it was going to take some doing to top all that. But that child had faith in the people who made I and II. And then along comes a camp slapstick comedy to make a particularly corny episode of the Batman circa 1968 look like the work of an auteur. Yes, I was that child and this review is turning into a rant but by God, I was only one of many many wide eyed children. The first two movies made $100 million each, compared with around $59 million for this one. And yes, Superman IV probably grossed about $19.99 (about twice its budget) but the idea of Superman breaking his rule of non-interference in human history is a good premise, spoiled by lack of money and talent. Superman III, conceived as a comedy vehicle for Richard Pryor, was a bad idea that exactly lived up to its promise. Pryor plays Gus Gorman a man whose IQ is supposedly high enough for him to be able to do ridiculous like make the green and red man brawl on the traffic lights but exposes his wealth to the villain Ross (Vaughun) and shoots off the edge of the villains's skyscraper penthouse on skis (which he survives). Gus; computer skills get him in with Ross and his lover and sister who are plotting to use computers to control the world's wealth, something that Superman is constantly thwarting. For example, he puts out a fire in a chemical factory but blowing cold on a lake, lifting the huge chunk of ice and laying it down on the scene of the blaze...we can't imagine that doing good for the community that's been robbed of its lake. Using a shard of radioactive kryptonite, they manage to create an evil superman. ""I hope you don't expect me to save you...cos I don't do that any more!"" he tells the blonde bimbo sitting atop Liberty's crown. Never mind, he will have his way with her later on (I thought in SM II he had to be divested of his powers by the red rays of Krypton before an erection was possible?) Still we would imagine that an evil superman would do something like lazer ray the waste tanks open on a nuclear power plant and irradiate the whole west coast of America. Instead he goes into a bar and fires peanuts at the mirror...""What ya lookin' at?!"" the drunk, dark-caped crusader, now sporting a jawline of stubble, slurs at the plebs in the street. He also does things like blow out the Olympic flame (whoa major league evilness here!) and beat up his goodie-goodie alter ego in a junkyard. As for Clark, he goes to Smallville and comes face to face with one time crush Lana and his bullying nemesis Brad, the movie's most bearable part. But at the end of the day, this is not so much Superman and Pryorman the Movie. And Pryor was always at his best when a foul-mouthed, taboo-busting stand up. No disrespect either to Robery Vaughun but as a screen villain, he has neither the wit of Gene 'Miss Tessmacher!' Hackman nor the menace of Terrence 'Kneel before Zod!' Stamp. Let us hope lessons have been learnt and we don't see Brandon Routh pared with Chris Rock next summer with the latter taking up half the movie...",Superman III
182,dmusucksdonkey,Best of the Lot,8,11 February 2008,"I do declare that the third instalment of the Superman series is the best by a mile. I know what you are thinking, this guy is out of his mind and that film was pants. But let me explain. The whole idea of Superman is ridiculous and he is the lamest of all the comic book heroes. It's such an unimaginative concept to say a bloke can fly, is really fast, nothing can hurt him, oh, except part of his home planet. Why was he not dying on Kypton as a baby?? Anyway, I digress. This movie has Richard Pryor in it, being generally goofy. He plays Gus Gorman, an unemployed man claiming benefits until he is told he won't be given anymore unless he finds a job. He gets a job at some computer company, and whilst having a chat with some bloke about how fractions of pennies are deducted off peoples salaries, he somehow knows exactly how to find these fractions, and also puts them into his wage packet. Eh?? You were unemployed last week, where did you get the training to be an expert computer hacker? So anyway, naturally the boss notices quite a bit of money has gone, then good oul Gus, the genius that he is, turns up in a Ferrari with loud music. Nice and conspicuous! Rather than just call the police and have him sent to jail, the bad guy reckons it'd be better to use his expert knowledge on computers to his advantage and start sending oil tankers into the middle of nowhere and stuff. He also somehow develops Kryptonite, but is missing an element of it's composition, so adds tar. When Superman receives this gift from Gus (posing as an army dude) he starts going bad for some reason. This is where I have a problem with this flick. surely it's not the chemical composition of Kryptonite that affects Superman?? Anyway, superman goes bad for a bit until some little wiener kid says you can do it superman, you're just in a slump, you'll be great again. He stops flying and fights with himself in a junkyard. Clark Kent jumps out of a car crushing machine and throttles the bad Superman til he disappears, then goes about redeeming himself for all the petty stuff he was doing, such as spilling oil all over the sea, and straighting the leaning tower of Pisa.Gus astounds us further with his knowledge of computers, and designs a super computer on the back of empty cigarette packets. And when it is built for him by the bad guy (who I can't remember the name of), they decide the best place to put it is in the Grand Canyon. Excellent location. Just popping out to check my emails dear, I'll be back in a month! The computer somehow has a beam of Kryptonite as one of it's weapons, and turns the bad guy's sister into a robot for a period of five minutes while she fights Superman. This film is absolutely ridiculous, but excellent to watch when you've had a few brewskis, or watching with your mates if they are similarly minded.Long live Gus Gorman!",Superman III
183,charlessmith702210-205-685220,Superman III Features New Supercomputer That Goes Wild,8,4 April 2021,"When I first saw this flick, Ross Webster now becomes sort of a offshoot of the evil Lex Luthor in the Superman and Superman II movie.With that, Ross in Superman III focuses on Gus Gorman (a computer expert played by Richard Pryor) to defeat the powers of Superman by modifying all of his regular behaviors of what Superman stands for--good, kindness, and sincerity.I then realized that the attack on Superman was three-prong. First, Ross forces Gus Gorman to alter the weather satellites on a computer mainframe system, so that the altering will cause a major tropical storm in Colombia that would destroy the country's coffee crop and terribly destroy the world markets that
depend on that valuable crop.I also see that Gus does his evil deed but was informed that Superman countered this super-storm over Columbia by his common super-strengths (like turning a twister upside down or blowing strong winds with his mouth to dry up the flooded crops), which made Ross mad.Then, the second prong is to find Superman's chemical qualities, which included of course, Kryptonite, made of course from the planet Krypton, which detonated completely by the super-heating sun in the first Superman movie. Gus gets back to a mainframe computer station and does find the exact chemical qualities in the Krypton, and then, that Krypton rock is sent to Superman, and then, Superman becomes two parts--one angry and drunk--called ""bad Superman"", and the other part, called ""good Superman.""
This leads to the final battle in a garbage dump between the two different Superman beings...finally, a choke hold by the good Superman ends the bad Superman for good. When I saw that happened-it was a sigh
of relief!The third prong attack on the good Superman (with the ""bad Superman"" now gone) focuses on Gus's design of a supercomputer somewhere in the desert Southwest. I then saw that Ross then beckons Superman in the final conflict, and Superman knows that he has to be stopped before the supercomputer
rules Ross's goal of world conquest that could lead to worldwide chaos and destruction.I found that this third prong attack was in 2 stages. In stage 1, as Superman comes towards the location of the cave from the outside, he is greeted by plenty of surface-to-air rockets (part of the computer's exterior defense system) that aims toward him, but Superman does evade the destructive
missiles as Ross, along with two lady assistants, uses the supercomputer as some type of video game as they were destined to kill Superman. When those regular missiles were ineffective, there was a call to fire the MX--a much bigger surface-to-air missile, which does hit Superman and he falls to the ground near
the cave. At the same time, Gus Gorman goes into the cave and sees his computer creation come to life.Gus then is greeted graciously by Ross, to join in the computer's bells and whistles to try to finish off Superman.Superman does get up and go right into the supercomputer cave, and tells Ross that this game is over. This leads to Stage 2 of Ross's attack, when Ross then stops Superman with the computer's Krypton laser pulse--the chemical Gus made. As Superman is stunned in terrible pain and collapses, Gus
then runs into the main power switch and pulls the plug, turning the whole computer off.This buys time for Superman, but suddenly, the computer goes on again, and Gus realizes that the computer wants to be something like a monster. It had gone completely mad, and one lady assistant is entrapped by the device and becomes an evil cyborg. Superman leaves the cave and comes back with a
closed special acid canister that is inert. And as he was about to attack the computer, the computer was counterattacks and stuns Superman with shock hits, and then with a backing laser magnet that forces Superman into the supercomputer's inner core to fatally entrap him; at this point, he opens up the acid canister, and the acid does its work. It eats away and then destroys the whole supercomputer from the inside out--starting with small--and then big--explosions.After all of the explosions were over, I now find that the supercomputer is now rubble with twisted and bent steel, and I then see that Superman comes out from the destruction, was able to find Gus alive (he hid somewhere to evade the carnage), and takes Gus back alive, out of the cave, to his original
workplace. Superman says that the other people will be brought to justice, including Ross.From all of the seriousness of this flick, there is a lighter part of this movie where Lois Lane is introduced to a brand new writer for the Daily Planet, Lana Lane. She appears brighter in appearance than the original Lois. The ending of the movie was, I thought, something that Superman had which was
a new trait--the ability to bring a historic structure back to its normal place, and that is what Superman did to bring the Tower of Pisa, which went straight up when Superman turned bad, back to its original leaning position. The Italian clay makers who saw Superman, as I see it, realize what happened and
decided to use a chisel to destroy a number of clay replicas of the straight Tower of Pisa.",Superman III

Stuff like this is why it took so long to get good comic book movies.There is no reason this had to suck. I've seen Superman the movie and its transcendent. Instead we get this terrible goofy opening of dumb gags that has nothing to do with anything and then a bunch of boring stuff about computers and unemployment and coffee and oil markets and then a super computer that makes people into killer robots and wants to live after its been unplugged and so on and so on.I guess it does resemble some the bad silver age comics dopiness.

185,Victory_Over_Trolls,Not as bad as everybody says.,8,13 March 2005,"Here we have a clear-cut example of a superhero film that, in the hands of another director, might have been amazing. It's a guilty pleasure for some and a nightmare for others. As is the case with BATMAN FOREVER, this film is lumped in with its bomby successor and not given a fair trial. As with the other Superman films, however, the cast (at-least the good guys) give the film a major boost.The opening salvo basically sets the tone for the rest of the movie. If you like the pre-credits scene, then you'll like the rest of the movie. If not, turn it off.The plot involves a man named Gus Voorman (Richard Pryor) who gets tangled up with his evil boss, Ross Webster (uh...), his mean sister (uh...) and his blonde kept-girl (uh...). These three villains make Lex n' co from part 1 look like Zod n' co from part 2. They could have made it ""about computers"" (you have to admit, it was ahead of its time in that) and had Brainiac be the bad guy or something. People always complain that Pryor wasn't ""at his best,"" during this film, but if he were that might have been inappropriate for a PG film.What makes this film better than people say (and what leads me to believe it could have been better) is the subplot involving Clark's return to Smallville. Annette O'Toole (who plays Clark's mother Martha Kent on SMALLVILLE) is fantastic as Lana Lang. She rivals Margot Kidder's Lois mainly because she added something new to the character. In the comics of the Silver Age, she was supposed to be Superboy's Lois. Then Lana began appearing in Superman stories and basically became Lois's red-headed counterpart. Here, she's the opposite of Lois: considerate, down to Earth and in love with Clark more than with Superman. This carried over into the comics when Superman's history was revamped in 1986, and his choosing Lois over her hints at a slight masochistic streak (understandable for an invulnerable man).SPOILER WARNING!!! The story takes a turn when Superman goes bad. It's a result of what is essentially red kryptonite (even though it's still green) and it starts with negligence, then he engages in pranks and acts surly. Aside from being seduced by the blonde chick into destroying an oil tanker or something, ""bad"" Superman doesn't do anything THAT bad. It's not like he kills someone. Whatever, he splits into two people. One, the bad one, is still in his Superman costume (albiet, he's unshaven and it's darker) and the other, the good one, is in the guise of Clark Kent. This hints at some really fascinating symbolism. Is it because Superman is a pretension that attracts women like Lois and Clark is who he really is deep down and he should be with Lana? Is it because Superman is a false idol who fights battles the human race should fight for themselves, and Clark is a reporter who gives people the knowledge to do that and is the part of him that makes an honest living? Is it because Superman is a jock and Clark is a nerd? Sadly, they're just Supes and Clark so you can tell them apart. They might as well have replaced him with the red-garbed ""player 2"" Superman from the arcade game.The special effects in this film are an improvement over the second one. Unless you're a kid, they won't knock your socks off, but they're mostly fairly convincing and they're more at-the-service of the actors. As a fight scene, the Supes vs Clark scene is surprisingly vibrant and Reeve and Lester pull it off well. There's also a sequence at a chemical plant (which does have a payoff at the end) that's very well done. Anyway, the villains are truly uninspired and that's really what hurts the film (although, Webster does prefigure the post-Crisis Lex). If Superman was given a more compelling antagonist and if they'd played on the strengths of the subplot more, it could have been the best in the whole series.",Superman III
186,tdkrbatmanfan,Where's the magic from the first two?,4,22 July 2012,"This is a terribly boring movie. It is uninteresting. No Lois Lane. The villains are weak, as Gus Gorman is just treated so terribly in my opinion. The first two were great. The climax of Superman was undoubtedly one of the best in history, but the rest of the movie drags, but is still great. Superman II is just amazing. Zod is a great villain, as are Ursa and Non. But Faora should'v been used. Then comes this insult to your intelligence. It took me 3 attempts to finish this pile of garbage.My main problem is that it takes more than an hour for something interesting to happen. Then when you think things are gonna pick up, all Superman does is straighten the leaning tower of pisa. Just awful. The end, while good, doesn't make up for the terrible lead in. All in all, this movie had high expectations for me, as i loved the first two. But it fell flat completely. This is just too much of a parody, and I couldn't stand it. In fact, it was so bad for me, that I find myself enjoying Superman IV: The Quest for Peace. Now that one doesn't deserve hate. It raised the bar a little after this mess.",Superman III
187,RobTheConqueror,The Beginning of the End,4,15 January 2016,"I wrote an almost essay long review on Superman II gushing about how great it was and how much it (along with the first movie) helped set the benchmark for what comic book movies should be like. The following two Superman movies on the other hand helped set the benchmark for what comic book movies *shouldn't* be like, and that's really all I feel like saying about Superman III in general (I'm not sure I have the strength to re-visit Superman IV: The Quest For Peace)It takes everything that was wonderful about the first two and strips them away, creating a brainless comedy that is almost a page by page adaption of a typical Superman comic book, which, as this movie proved, is NOT how you make a good comic book movie.All the emotion of the first two films? Gone, replaced by the ""comedy"" of Richard Pryor, who drags the movie down with his awful character and performance, ultimately being totally worthless to the plot.The compelling antagonists? Also gone, replaced by a typical evil businessman villain that seems like a cheap replacement for Lex Luthor due to the absence of Gene Hackman because of his loyalty to Richard Donner.Margot Kidder as Lois Lane is disappointingly absent, reduced to a cameoHell, even the small sense of plausibility is gone, replaced by a plot that drowns in silliness.The one thing the movie still has going in its favour is Christopher Reeve, who continues to play his iconic portrayal of Superman to perfection, and this time gets to stretch his acting muscles by also playing a brainwashed, evil Superman, which he pulls off superbly.Roger Ebert said ""Superman III is the movie I feared the original Superman would be"" and with that line he nailed more than I have in this entire review why the original film worked and this didn't.",Superman III
188,brandon-tyler-328-43902,The most underrated movie of all time.,10,7 February 2017,"Superman III is best watched on a Saturday night, with fizzy and sweets. It's such an entertaining flick that includes action, comedy, suspense, love and excellent stunts. Richard Pryor is great as the unlucky Gus Gorman, a man that can't quite find the right job. He soon becomes involved with the villains as his computer skills become abused for the evil plans of Mr.Webster. There are many interesting plots in Superman III, such as Superman's fall from grace and the relationship between Clark Kent and Lana Lang. Ken Thorne gives the film some style and Gorgio Moroder produces some decent synth songs that feature throughout the adventure. The special effects are well realised and the best of the series by a country mile. The junkyard fight is also a memorable sequence which ranks as my favourite moment from the Superman films. Superman III shouldn't be a 4.9; it's too good for that.",Superman III
189,bignastybastard,"Okay film, worth watching if your a Superman fan",6,8 June 2011,"This film takes more flack than what it deserves. The problem with this film is there's too many pointless characters, such as Gus Gorman don't get me wrong I absolutely love Richard Pryor but the character just served no purpose in the film whatsoever. Secondly there's Russ Webster, who in the absence of Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor basically just played the same kind of character, although I think Russ Webster is what Luthor should have been but less goofy, and then there's his sister who randomly gets turned into a cyborg robot thingy.Aside from all that there's some good things about the film, we see Clark Kent return to his roots in Smallville and reignite an old flame with Lana Lang. The best part of this film is Superman getting exposed to a type of Kryptonite that creates a dark Superman which leads to a classic showdown of Clark Kent vs Dark Superman.As a kid I used to love this film but now when I watch it it just appears to have no development or direction to it. One for a Superman fan no where near as good as Superman I&II. Definitely lots better than Superman IV though.",Superman III

191,ace531,Another underrated sequel,9,31 May 2001,"This is another example of how the third movie in a series is often the best but is over looked by so many.  It follows the same pattern as movies like Star Trek III, Nightmare on Elm Street III, and Rocky III.  Although the third installment of a series is often the best, it is most times the least shown and the most hated by many people.Richard Pryor gave a classic performance as the unemployed bum turned computer whiz.  Although many critics seem to hate much of his work, I don't think he made a single bad movie until Another You, which was a great Disappointment.  His antics make me laugh over and over no matter how many times I watch him.I do think that the scenes involving the chemical plant fire were unnecessary.  Do we really need that much of a reminder of what a super hero he is?  But other than that it was a spectacular film.It was a breath of fresh air to see Clark's love interests move beyond the tired old path of Lois Lane, and although Lex Luthor is your classic Bad Guy, it would be unbearably monotonous for him to be involved in EVERY attempt to take over the world.All in all I give it a 9 star, minus one for the unnecessary scenes that made some of the beginning drag more than needed.",Superman III
192,jacksenvy,Superman III: Ugh!!,4,27 December 2006,"I thought Superman III was one of the worst sequels of all time. From the start it veers in to Slapstick comedy. And what the hell is Richard Pryor doing in a Superman movie?!?!?! I thought the ""villians"" were useless, the blonde just sheer annoying, and the direction of the movie, its production values, the script, everything was below mediocre. It looks like the Salkinds aimed for the sidewalk, but couldn't get past the gutter. Lois Lane is all but cut from the film. Lois Lane! Just about the most important supporting character in the entire series/comic books. And all because she had the guts to tell the Salkinds the way it was. There were so many missed opportunities with this film. The return to Smallville and Clarks relationship with Lana could have been something special. And the ""evil Superman"" thread could have been an absolute barn stormer. But in the hands of those idiot producers and Richard Lester it amounts to nothing. Nothing. The ball was dropped so often on this picture you'd think it was smeared in baby oil. I really felt for Reeve as once again he rose above all mediocrity to put in a performance so honest, so regal, so Superman, that it is he and he alone who earns this picture any marks whatsoever. It is no wonder that when Singer made Superman Returns, he chose to pretend parts III and IV never happened. The producers and their best mate Lester - I am presuming that is how he got the job again! - almost destroyed a 20th century icon, and then for years after claim it ""wasn't their fault""!!! Yeah, right. In Donners/Singers hands this film could have been special. A continuance of a great saga of one of the movie worlds greatest hero's. Instead, we get Pryor, a nameless blonde, and an over tanned millionaire. Poor, poor film.",Superman III

It has fallen straight out of Salkind sphincter (the producer) but does serve to exemplify everything that can and should be avoided by future film makers.From the outset this film bombards the audience with its wit; this in particular seems to be directly related to the very real possibility that the producer may not have been a legally responsible adult.To Surmise; the producers and writers of this film should not be left unsupervised with potentially dangerous items, namely scissors, pens or cotton-wool.",Superman III
195,SecularTheocrat,Where this series starts to go downhill,5,28 August 2018,"This movie is in my opinion, not as bad as I often hear, it still has some enjoyable moments and stand out scenes, however when compared to the first 2 instalments it is of noticeably poorer quality.I will start of with some positives, because despite popular belief there are a few of note.The special effects, like the first 2 instalments were spectacular, or at least they are when you consider the context of the pre-CGI period when this movie was made.Christopher Reeve is once again outstanding and this time was not overshadowed by any villains as the villains in this movie were mostly dull and 1 dimensional (I'll get to this later).The Score is still good (Done again by Ken Thorne).I know i'm probably in the minority here, but I did find the Leaning Tower of Pisa jokes incredibly funny, I can't explain why though.Now that that's done with, I guess it's time for the bad stuff.The movie overdid it with the comedy, there was comedy in the first 2 instalments, however it was used appropriately and never detracted from any serious scenes. Many of the jokes (with the exception of the misfortune of the Italian stall owner) didn't land for me and came off as forced. This movie lacked a convincing and likeable villain like Zod or Lexy 
Richard Pryor was overly comedic and seemed to bumble his way through the movie (I attribute much of this to the writing rather than Pyror himself) and i'm not buying him being a computer genius. It seems completely out of place with the character that is established. The CEO guy was relatively one dimensional and was the generic evil industrial magnate with very generic motivations. The computer was like a disabled Hal 9000 or something. 
It was also to some extent unclear who the main villain was, in I it was Lex Luthor, in II it was Zod with luthor playing a secondary role. In this movie it starts out as Gus Gorman, then the CEO of the company he works at, then randomly in the last 20 minutes, the computer built by Gorman turned on everyone.Overall this movie is bad, but not terrible, it is till watchable and fairly entertaining, also compared to IV it is Citizen Kane. The movie is salvagable and the plot could have worked (Albeit with considerable changes).",Superman III
196,adriank1,The decline of the Superman in the Movies!,5,19 December 1999,"Firstly the highlight's of this film are for it's time a timely storyline about the threat of computers and those whom abuse the power of them,the sub-plot of Clark Kent's trip back to hometown Smallville rekindling relationship with former high-school love Lana Lang. The Smallville Chemical-plant fire-acid disaster that Superman fly's into action for and the split/personality confrontation between the good Clark and the evil Superman are standout's in a pretty abysmal slapstick slock of a comedy weakened by poorly written characterisation's and un-intentionally or not ludicrous humor. SPFX are less impressive, the film's budget was far less than the previous two and it shows production values in decline as a result. WONDERFUL performances by CHRIS REEVE and ANNETTE O'TOOLE and the under-used regular's JACKIE COOPER,MARC McCLURE and reduced to a breif-cameo this time around MARGOT KIDDER as Lois Lane. Nothing wrong with the guest-cast,as actors all are good but their respective roles in this film were dreadful. Not really a movie for repeated viewing's but recommended for small children who should enjoy fantasy and nonsense after all it's a Superman flick and despite as low as they got CHRIS REEVE kept the portrayal's top-knotch despite the behind the scenes creative difficulties that let soo many fan's down.",Superman III
197,GABaracus,Superman: The Comedy,5,26 March 2005,"For years, many fans wondered about what has become known as the ""hybrid version"" of Superman II, which was half directed by Richard Donner and half directed by Richard Lester after Donner was unceremoniously dumped from the project.Superman II was a very strong sequel despite all the production woes, but has not held up nearly as well as the first film, and now plays more like camp in many spots. Was this Lester's influence, or was the plan always to lighten the tone of the sequel to create more of a popcorn film? Well, we all got our answer in 1983, when Superman III debuted, this completely under the guiding hand of Richard Lester.From the film's opening credit sequence, a completely farcical series of events, you get that sinking feeling and realize that anything resembling cheese and slapstick in the second film was directly the influence of Lester. The first Superman was grounded in a sense of reality, even if it was a comic book one, which is noticeably absent from much of Superman II. In the first film, Metropolis always seemed like a real city with real people inhabiting it. The second recalled a city on a sound stage with only the vaguest sense of a distorted reality. Well, the filmmakers decided to distort reality further in Superman III by ignoring what made the franchise great and going with a hipper, more today approach. They accomplished this by centering the film around the casting of Richard Pryor. The problem with this approach is that there is absolutely no reason for Richard Pryor to appear in Superman III other than the fact that he's Richard Pryor.The idea behind Superman III is actually a fairly intriguing one, where a computer genius constructs a super-computer, which in a unique turn of events alters the mental stability of Superman, turning him away from his All-American persona. Suddenly, Superman is no longer the hope for all mankind, but the ""anti Superman"" intent on destroying us. It also contains one of the best moments in the series, as Clark Kent and the evil Superman actually battle each other. It's one of the highpoints of the entire series, yet still can't avoid being disappointing by the overall poor quality of the production.I Thank the heavens that a good 20 minutes of this movie was cut for theatrical release because it just made the pacing even worse!, most of the footage cut was more pointless forced comedy moments and the only high point of the footage being reinserted for the Extended TV Version shown numerous times in the late eighties were the newly created opening credits in space, rather then the credits appearing during the opening montage in the theatrical cut.So what went wrong? I would put the blame squarely at the feet of Lester and the Salkinds, who seemed to want to make a ""Richard Pryor"" Superman movie rather than a film that was true to the spirit of the characters and the original film. Pryor is given far too much screen time despite the fact that he's not even the main villain. The producers obviously figured that, if they're paying Richard Pryor, they may as well use him, whether it benefits the film or not. So what would I have done differently? Well, the plot about a super computer and an altered Superman is a fantastic direction for the film to go, but that's where they left it. I would have eliminated the character of Ross Webster, the ultimate corporate bad guy, and everyone around him in favor of Gus Gorman, the computer genius trying to dominate the world on his own. The Webster character is totally unnecessary and a more maniacal Gorman working in solitude would have been far more menacing But the catch is that with Pryor in the role of Gorman, the producers obviously felt a need to allow him to redeem himself in the end, so I say they should have removed Pryor, too. This could also have cut out much of the unnecessary comic drivel that ruins Superman III.Ultimately, Superman III is not the worst entry in the series, but not for a lack of trying. Richard Lester proved once and for all that he really didn't understand what a Superman movie should be, seemingly relying on British slapstick comedy that is taken right out of an episode of Monty Python's Flying Circus ""where it belongs!"" and a pathetic, poor script that he and probably only ten other people found amusing. He must have forgotten that Superman is aimed towards an American audience. The movie does actually start to get good from the moment supes becomes ""anti-supes"", Watching the dual between Clark and Superman really lets you see how the whole movie could have been made ""dark and serious"" and kept out of the silly comedy path ""even with Pryor and other factors etc"" If Superman III had been made this way it probably would have been better then II!. The Superman vs. Clark scene proves this, In Superman II where Zod and Superman battle it out, the end result is disappointing and nothing really happens other then Superman throwing Zod into a Coca-Cola sign, the confrontation in III is far far better!. With all the great characters and history that Superman has encountered, there were really limitless possibilities for this sequel. Unfortunately for fans, we happened to get stuck with filmmakers who obviously were limited in their abilities, talents and taste!. The last 35 minutes of this movie on a whole deserves a 6/10 rating. Why could the other 85 minutes of this movie not of been the same!, The rest of the movie deserves nothing more then a poor...3/10",Superman III

The humor' scenes, perhaps, aren't the best, but that is compensated with the excellent plot. The introduction of computers in the Superman's list of enemas and the creation of synthetic kryptonite give the movie a very interesting story. And the Evil Superman's appearance -with the later fight between him and Clark Kent- gives a turn to the situation. Perhaps, the final fight with the super computer elevates the quality of the film, showing us a super hero facing with an enemy who knows his weaknesses. The evils -like in cartoon movies- are stupid, but very ingenious at the time of creating devices to kill Superman. Definitively, SEE IT. You'll not loss your time.",Superman III
199,Colby6921,Superman and Pryor not the Greatest duo,2,8 August 2006,"Superman The Movie was the blockbuster of its time, an allstar cast, and a fresh new line of Special Effects, and awesome Storwriters. It is the best in the series, and has stood the test of time. Superman II was also very good, it lives up to the first one, and the new Richard Donner cut coming in November should be even better than the one we're all accustomed to! After the first seqel though, is where things began to change...At the end of the 2nd movie, ""COMING SOON SUPERMAN III!"" was the first sentence in the credits. Lets get our hopes up for the next one the First two were great! Audiences soon found that was not the case for the 1983 film starring Christopher Reeve and...Richard Pryor?!WHAT WAS WRONG?After I, and II Gene Hackman and Margot Kidder were openly angry at the Producers Ilya and Alexander Salkind for firing Richard Donner off the 2nd movie, he had filmed the 1st film, and most of the 2nd when this happened. So Hackman refused to show up in III. And Margot talked about the Salkinds or something publicly about the Salkinds firing Donner.So...They kept her pretty low profile in Superman III, saying she took a Vacation to Bermuda. This kinda killed off Clark Kent's original love life for the movie. The Salkinds also made some other choices that killed the movie. They decided to go with a campier movie this time. Completely diminishing the seriousness of Superman I and II. Richard Pryor wasn't too bad for the style of movie, but...he doesn't really seem like the best computer genius.Now to the point, Superman III suffered deeply from the aspects above. Being the only movie to fail to have Lex Luthor, and Lois Lane. It was a poor sequel to the 1st two. And I rate it a 3/10. The special effects as far as Superman flying, and using heat vision were at their best here, but still this wasn't enough to save the movie. The script was also way too Campy. Poor Job here Salkinds. So this movie failed to get good reviews, and lost popularity. The new November DVD Should be great though! The Best part of Superman III was the battle between Clark and Evil Superman. Christopher Reeve was a great actor, and showed a whole new role for himself in that small part of the movie where he is evil. But this was indeed a good performance by Reeve. (But without Lois Lane he had to start over again with the Lana in Smallvill, and Pryor also made too much of a competetor of all the attention)",Superman III

He was very funny in that one.  I love the scene when Superman split in to two.  Like good Clark Kent and bad Superman.  Then, they end up fighting.  And, good Clark Kent wins against bad Superman.  The best part with Richard Pryor, was when he flew with Superman at the near end of the movie.

201,davidadowns,Should have focused less on humor,4,24 April 2011,"The great debate amongst Superman film fans is whether this film or #4 is the worst of the series. I gave Superman 4 a 4 out of ten rating, and this one also gets a 4 out of ten. So, neither ones wins! Unlike my last review, I'll split this into pros and cons to make this speedier. Pros: Christopher Reeve is great in his trio of roles (good Superman, Clark Kent, and evil Superman). You really believe him in all three, and the battle in the junkyard is one of the best scenes (if not the best) in the entire series. His romance with Lana Lang (Annette O'Toole) is done solidly, and his efforts help overcome some of the flaws. The effects are also good (though not quite up to 1 & 2's level), the music is improved from #2, and some of the humor works.Cons: The main problem is that there's too much humor. Admittedly, that is director Richard Lester's forte, but there is such a thing as overkill. The much-lampooned opening sequence demonstrates this; instead of an epic space opening, we see the citizens of Metropolis bumble through one slapstick scene after another. From mimes to pies in the face to blind people running crazy to penguins on fire to a person drowning in their own car, you'd think this was the opening scene of Saturday Night Live instead of Superman!Another problem is the insertion of Richard Pryor into the film. By this point, Pryor's movie career was in a bit of a rut, and here the director tries too hard to make the film focus on him instead of Reeve. Pryor's character, Gus Gorman, is meek and a push-over, definitely not a character you'd expect Pryor to play. And some of his scenes (such as when he skis down a skyscraper) fail to produce laughs. So he's wasted somewhat in his role.The plot (where the antagonist Ross Webster, played by Robert Vaughn, tries to gain economic power by using Gorman's skill with computers) is hard to take seriously. How can you expect Gorman to be a computer whiz when he can't even land steady work prior to this? And the creation of synthetic Kryptonite by placing tar as the unknown ingredient? Genius! In seriousness, the plot would have been better had they created Brainiac (which was considered, but not done).The climatic ending looks like it was ripped directly from a low-budget 50s horror movie, complete with one of the worst movie robots of all time. It looks like the love child of C-3PO and Sharon Osborne! While it is somewhat scary (if you're a kid), adults won't find it anything but laughable.So, if you want to watch a Superman film that has a few good scenes but is plagued by abuse of humor, then 3 is your picture. If you want a film that has the right combination of pathos and humor, then get Superman 1. If only they had that junkyard scene in it...",Superman III
202,heybabyxxx,Unfairly underrated,8,24 November 2006,"This is, by far, my favorite feature film with Superman to this day. It gets better every time I watch it. Unfortunately, its qualities not always are recognized.It's a great comedy, an action film, a science fiction and a very bright observation of the changes that the popularization of computers brought in the early 80s.Also, brings the best performance of Christopher Reeve in the series and, possibly, in all his career. Margot Kidder, although doesn't appear much, is always OK, but the greatest surprise is Pamela Stephenson, fantastic as the false dumb blonde, questioning Kant when nobody is looking.There are a lot of unforgettable scenes, but the movie becomes really great after Superman is exposed to a fake piece of kryptonite and becomes bad, blowing out the torch of the Olympic Games, straightening the tower of Pisa and destroying a bar with peanuts after a shot of whisky.This movie is unfairly underrated (maybe because it's so daring and original) and it is yet to be rediscovered.

There is much that sucks about this film which will escape the kids (at least for me, kids raised on transformers may laugh at it for the wrong reasons) but Richard Pryor adds some redeeming comedy to it to make it a good film for all the family, if Richard Pryor is not your sort of thing you can always pick out the sometimes laughable errors to have your fun with, for me the nostalgia and Richard Pryor kept me there until the end and for this I would give it a 7, but if these doesn't appeal to you the film is more accurately a 4 or 5, 2 or 3 for anyone expecting the same as the two previous films, as it is more a comedy, the action in it is quite weak.",Superman III

I'm a big Chris Reeve fan, so I won't bash him. (God rest his soul...) The only thing that REALLY bugged me was that his hair was brown...with highlights! HELLO!?! Supes hair is jet black...or did no one look at the first two movies? The line ""Let's see how long he can live without air!"" What??? Are you kidding me? Ummm...didn't he just send a nuclear elevator from Paris into space a few years back? Get real! Lana's son...Tommy or Timmy or whatever. What an annoying little kid. He deserves to get beat up.Special effects. Did they fire the SFX people from the first two movies and hire some graduate of Devry? No offense Devry...Aghghhh!!! I was just so frustrated watching this movie. Oh but wait until I saw Superman IV: The Quest for Peace!",Superman III

209,sillybilly452,whatever,5,30 May 2005,"Not only did I feel that this wasn't a great movie, some people are going to hate me for saying this. I didn't like it as much as Superman IV. Now don't get me wrong, this was a descent movie but I just didn't feel it had as much magic as the 4th one.I missed the romance between Superman and Lois Lane, probably because Kidder only had a cameo. And the thing I missed most was Gene Hackman. For the first two movies, he was a great criminal and I think he got into it a little bit. But beyond that, I didn't like the idea of someone overnight being able to know everything about computers and do whatever he wanted.Finally the thing that bugged me was the opening scene. I loved seeing all the names fly by in the first two, now this just made me want to cry.",Superman III
210,biaggi1,Evil side of Superman you never thought you'd see,10,15 June 2005,"I've always associated Superman with being good but in this movie he turns BAD! The transformation to the evil Superman is most enjoyable as his suit becomes darker and he is unshaven, He looks cool and it really shows how good of an actor the late Christover Reeve was. He had great timing and showed that he can play more than just one role. I don't see why this movie has been slated by many, people take this movie too seriously and look at it negatively, maybe these people had a bad childhood or something as they seem to have a constant chip on their shoulder about this film. It may not be a masterpiece but it is still a very enjoyable film and much better than trash such as Hulk and Spiderman (First one)which pass as movies nowadays when all they are re doing are exploiting the franchise in order to sell merchandise. Long Live Superman!",Superman III
211,RomulusAurelius,Third Time's a Disaster!,3,17 December 2018,"Superman III stands as the black sheep of all the entries featuring the Man of Steel, it also shows us how bad comedy and camp can ruin a film.The producers wanted more comedy, because apparently the first one and the second one didn't have enough of that, therefore they got Richard Pryor for the price of 5 million dollars, even Pryor himself said the screenplay was terrible, but the money was surely too good to turn down.The idea in films, especially in superhero flicks, is to blend in comedy and a serious tone together, instead this film grabs whatever moment is given to make cheap gags for the audience, the lowest of all being when Pryor's character uses a tablecloth as a cape and ski's down a building to land safely in the streets of Metropolis, that's a good thing to show to your kids, right?But it doesn't end there! There's a scene where the Computer tampers with the Traffic Lights and the lights themselves fight each other!This, and Jaws 3-D, is an example of how to kill your franchise with the third entry,
I give it 3 out of 10, for it's Superman III.",Superman III
212,ultrapro_samuelgrimes,Superman III - Not your average Superman Movie!!,5,2 July 2005,"I saw this movie when I was very young and when I was older wanted to see it again but could not find it in any of the shops ( I don't think they sell it in Australia anymore ) So I ordered it from amazon.co.uk and got it for my birthday and watched it straight away. This movie when compared to the other Superman movies is a complete and utter load of crap. *WARNING:CONTAINS SPOILERS* For example the first 2 entries in the franchise opened big with wonderful intergalactic credits. However in this installment the credits are absolute rubbish. Instead of taking place in space accompanied by the Superman Theme as they should do they are instead put over some crappy slapstick sequence which has absolutely no place in a Superman Movie and is a disgrace to the name of Superman. On a high note however this movie has great special effects, A superb cast and some good scenes. Superman III has the best scene in the Superman Trilogy ( and yes before people remind me that there are 4 Superman movies I know this but I say trilogy because I think the 4th Movie is a disgrace to the name of movies and dhould be wiped off the face of the earth. which I'm sure it will once everyones forgotten about it in a few years.) Anyway back to the topic Superman III contains the best scene in all 3 oh alright 4 of the Superman Movies-The fight between Good Superman and Evil Superman. Best scene in the series and is the highpoint of this film. Also the Chemical Fire scenes are very enjoyable. However the climax I thought was absolutely crap and to campy and far fetched. So there you have it. I think Superman III is an average movie that although not nearly as good as number I and II is still a reasonably good movie and has great acting, good special effects and beats Superman IV : The Quest For Crap any day.",Superman III
213,ruxxell,by far one of the worst movies ive ever seen,1,31 October 1999,"I just rented superman 1 2 and 3 and watched them in succession. 1 and 2 rule of course.... but this piece of "" needs to be banished from video stores everywhere. not only is ot completely far-fetched with the whole ""uber computer"" who has more powers than the terminator and my pentium III combined, but the plot is WEAK, and the acting is HORRIBLE. check out the scenes where ""evil superman"" tries to act tough. oooh.. tough man he is. whatever. dont rent this.. its a 1.5 hour trip into a bad place. even worse than ""batman and robin""",Superman III
214,thecolclough,"A classic example of ""so bad it's great"".",3,14 November 2008,"If you're a connoisseur of bad film-making, then this is a must-have for your collection.To be fair, it has a few good bits - most of them being Reeve's scenes - but it spends a lot of time being plain silly, and throwing together a yarn which looks far-fetched even by comic-book-movie standards. The daftness of the plot and shallowness of many of the characters, combined with a significant number of poorly-executed effects shots, produces an end result so awful that you can spend two very enjoyable hours just laughing at how bad it is.Superman: the Movie begins on an epic note, and maintains a degree of gravitas throughout - but this second sequel starts off with a ridiculous piece of slapstick mayhem, and never really tries to be serious at all. Many films try to get their audience emotionally invested in what's happening during the finale, whereas this one, if anything, saves the daftest for last.Superman III also suffers from the fact that many of the main characters from the first two films are either absent, or reduced to minor parts, and most of the story focuses on people who weren't there in the previous instalments, which makes this feel less like a continuation of the existing story, and more like a completely separate entity which just happens to feature the same actor as Superman.I gave it 1 star for its few decent bits of acting and characterisation (yes, there are one or two), 1 for some half-decent set designs, and 1 for being amusing. It loses the other 7 for throwing away most of what it inherited from its two predecessors, and reducing the series to a cheap, cheesy comedy.This film can be enjoyed if you don't expect too much of it - it's best watched with your brain completely disengaged.",Superman III

This is not good and shame on your people who came up with this story line. This story line was offensive to me when I looked around in the theater and saw the little kids watching this as I did as a child. What is coming next? What is ""OUR"" world coming to? People please take a good hard look in the mirror and ask yourself ""what are we teaching our children?"" By the way, I have teenagers ages 16 and up. I fear with all the things on TV and in movies that they will not have a youth. They will just come out knowing it all. Our Christian values are in jeopardy.",Superman III
216,stevesadlerjr,Not a bad follow-up to the first two.,9,23 January 2007,"I bought the special edition DVD not too recently and the extras were very intriguing. Also I'm a big fan of Richard Pryor, so I know that this one stands out from the first two.The film overall is pretty impressive, although critics at the time the film was released thought it was awful. The films new villains are not that bad, considering the lack the charisma of Lex Luthor and Co.One important subplot: a man-made form of Kryptonite; instead of killing him, the Man of Steel was turned evil. The sudden change also has has a fling with one of the villains. The movie's climax was very awe-inspiring and pretty technical with a huge payoff.Overall this film has a real feel-good quality to it. It is highly recommended.",Superman III

Whatever. After half a dozen incoherent plot developments we get to the final ""battle"" -if you want to call it that- which is one of the most embarrassing debacles in all of action cinema. (The SISTER of the ""villian"" gets turned into a cyborg (?) by Pryor's (AI?) napkin-sketch Superman-killing-machine. Then her first act is to stick the ""villian's"" girlfriend to the ceiling with some stupid blue ray that comes out of her finger? Slop.) This movie was little more than a parody of a Superman film, but its half-hearted shifts from slapstick comedy to real action prevent it from even making onto my camp classic list. The beautiful Annette O'Toole is about the only reason to watch Superman III.",Superman III
218,iluvkelly007,Clark Kent vs. Superman!,8,5 April 2007,"Superman III isn't as good as Superman I or II, but there is still an epic inside waiting to get out. It's better than Superman Returns, and far better than Superman IV. So why does it get such a bad rap? The answer is Richard Pryor, a weird robot, slapstick comedy, and the absence of Gene Hackman. I wouldn't be bothered by Pryor's acting if he was actually funny! But there are still some elements that make this movie great. Like the bad Superman fighting against the good Clark Kent, Clark going back home to Smallville, Clark's relationship with Lana, Superman saving people from a fire, the best special effects in the series, and a fight against a supercomputer that can read Superman's weaknesses. Fans of the comic also don't like this movie because it doesn't really use the source material for villains. But if you look hard enough you will find that they are just different interpretations. Ross Webster is the Corporate Lex Luthor, not the underground criminal Gene Hackman portrayed, Evil Superman is a form of Bizarro, and the supercomputer is like Braniac.",Superman III

220,jamespilcher1,unappreciated gem,8,11 February 2007,"This film is not like the first two, and because the first two were such awesome masterpieces that alone is generally considered to be a grave and unforgivable sin.In my opinion, people let some very strong merits of Superman III get buried in the twin shadows of Superman I & II.Superman III is largely tongue in cheek and played for laughs. But that's not to say that it is throw away and silly. The acting is still superb, the effects are still well budgeted and convincing. The action scenes are exciting and well executed. It doesn't seem like a cheap half-assed sequel.Superman III is played more ""comic book"" than the first two, but it doesn't come off as cheesy, because whenever anything inane or implausible happens, the characters react with incredulity and have comical responses. You always laugh with it, not at it.In the midst of all this campy comic book fun there is however one of the most fascinating conceits and most powerful and iconic scenes in any of the superman films. (SPOILER) We see what happens when superman's sense of selflessness and duty is removed; we see a man who can do anything he wants but has always felt that he is duty bound to ignore his own desires and needs in lieu of the needs of everybody else in the world. With this sense of duty rapidly eroding, he becomes disinterested and neglectful, more interested in indulging himself, until eventually he becomes embittered and resentful in the face of public criticism, ultimately leading him to become consumed with anger, hate and self pity. He ""turns evil"". The rapid and artificially induced nature of this change of heart comes to a head when superman literally develops a split personality.The scene in the scrapyard where superman fights himself is absolutely definitive of Christopher Reeve's superman. This scene alone, in my view, promotes Superman III from throwaway sequel to a serious and essential companion to the first 2 films. The way the scene can be interpreted as either a visualisation of an internal struggle, or literally as some kind of Kryptonian sci-fi voodoo, is genius. It ranks as highly as any of the moments of genius in the first two films.Not only does the film contain such a powerful and deep exploration of superman's character but it is also genuinely funny and exciting. People need to cut it some slack.",Superman III

222,basssssss,Powerful Romantic and Moral Tale,8,31 May 2005,"I really enjoyed seeing this film again, twenty years after the first time. The romance between Lana Lang and Superman is very powerful and we see that Superman is fallible after all and that the unassuming, unacclaimed Clark Kent is the real hero of the piece. Some people talk of bad framing but the bit where bad Superman's crotch is framed alongside the face of the bad girl who seduces him is brilliant. The fight scene between bad superman and good clark is a very powerful moral tale that tells us again that the true hero is the boring, pacifist Clark (but even the Coward of the County sometimes has to fight to be a man).So I don't see why everyone slags this film..its a pure gem and hilarious to boot.I just watched Star Wars Return of The Sith and now there is a real turkey!",Superman III

Not as good as the first 2 but all out fun.",Superman III
224,thalleck,Why it wasn't all that bad.,6,27 February 2006,"This movie really wasn't all that bad.WB and the Salkinds totally dropped the ball on the Superman movies up by removing the two key elements of the first two -- Richard Donner and Mario Puzo.The first two, while not being perfect, had the essentials - a great Superman (Reeve), an OK Lois (Kidder), an amazing soundtrack (Williams), and a pretty good directorial/writing team.The Newmans, the two men who helped write the first two movies, took charge in Superman III. This makes it BLATANTLY obvious, that these were the jerks who are responsible for the Otis and Teschmacher characters. Now the charm of these tidbits of comic relief are not lost on me, you can see that in III they jump headlong into comic disaster.It's obvious that the best parts of Superman I and II were not the silly parts. It was not Reeves' silly portrayal of Clark Kent, nor was it Otis and Ms. Teschmacher's ineptitude.The good parts of the first two films were the dramatic, serious parts. The music by Williams, the death of Jonathan Kent, Reeves' portrayal of Superman, General Zod/Presidential scenes. These were the parts that made these movies kick ass.I know that Clark Kent WAS portrayed as humbly bumbly in the 30s an 40s, but I think that Superman as a character is a lot more deep if Kent was a lot less one-dimensional. Although I am not a huge fan of the show, Smallville is proof that a nerdy, stupid Clark Kent is less entertaining (although does help explain the fact that no one knows he's superman a lot better).The third movie attempts to turn Luthor into what he evolved into in the comics-- a savvy businessman. In fact, I think it's possible that in the original script, Webster WAS Luthor. It's pretty obvious, the Lorelei Ambrosia character is a close take on the Teschmacher character, and Webster talking down to his assistant is reminiscent of the Otis/Luthor relationship.And also Websco = Luthorcorp? Superman movie makers should have evolved the Luthor character into one that more closely followed the comics, especially if they are going to CONTINUE USING HIM in EVERY ONE! What Superman needs is a villain, like the real Braniac, who is scarier and deeper than the ""I'm so evil but I'm not even scary"" villain portrayed by Hackman. The fact that Luthor (even in the second movie) is egotistical, considers himself a criminal mastermind, but has no reasoning for it, is ridiculous. I'm angry at the fact that Luthor is such a stupid, one-dimensional character. He is given no reason to even dislike Superman, other than Supes foiling every stupid scheme Luthor has.Parasite, Braniac... even DOOMSDAY, please, if you're not going to do a villain right, at least get a new one.Although when I saw Singer's Superman trailer, I got chills, he is using tired, old cinematic-Superman mistakes-- the addition to a character that's not in the script (a child), and even the Lex Luthor character, I do worry also.If anyone hasn't read the Kevin Smith Superman script-- I HIGHLY recommend it. The drama of the Death and Return of Superman has the potential for an amazing movie... as does a Batman versus Superman, and in the Marvel Universe, an Earth X movie, but I doubt any of them would ever happen.The problem with bad comic book movies is that they take a character with a rich and vibrant history, and don't respect it properly. Comic movie makers need to take the source material VERY seriously, and respect it. Comics ARE modern mythology, they can be some of the most interesting and deep stories in society today, but not when they are considered ""funny"" books and taken as childish, pulp trash.",Superman III
225,serdarbmw,Better that I expected,6,19 August 2005,"I liked this movie for the bad Superman. Reeve looked more charismatic when he was the bad Superman, especially during the fight with Clark. There was unnecessary humor throughout the movie which I disliked. I am a fan of Smallville and one of the reasons I watched this movie was to see Annette O'Toole as Lana Lang. After Smallville it is quite interesting to see her as Lana Lang. You could see that Lois Lane felt jealous after meeting Lana in the office. I liked that! Poor Clark was at last getting some attention from Lana. I am eagerly waiting for the next Superman movie coming up in June 2006. From what I have seen that movie is going to be great.",Superman III

The story is unique, in 1983 computers were new and no one really knew what they were capable of. The main villain, Webster, was a better Lex Luthor than Lex Luthor was in the first two movies. And in this one they focused more on the humor, how could you not with Richard Pryor? And, it is 1983. Not a lot out there if you wanted to see a superhero movie. And I LOVE Brad.

228,warriors473,"Superman 3, brought to you by KFC",6,26 March 2007,"Don't get me wrong, it had its moments, but after seeing and reading the background of the Donner vs Lester thing with Superman 2, it is obvious that Lester was much more interested in the Comedy than the red cape. Its a slap stick comedy with a couple of scenes with Reeves in the blue tights to justify the name of the movie, and the money he was paid.The introduction credits are case in point, but I am more offended by the skit in which Gus is drunk and operating the computer. You know the scene, where the guy at the ATM keeps getting all that money and starts stuffing down his pants, the old dude stuffs an orange or a lemon or something into his wife's face (well she was annoying). However the worst part of this sequence was the part in which the lights go bung and the red (or stop) light man starts fighting the green (or walk) light.I swear on my left foot, and my right one as well if it helps,at this point in the movie, when I was watching this movie when I was 7 or 8, I thought I had accidentally changed the channel or dosed off for an hour and not noticed, because I was convinced I was not watching a Superman movie. I swear.As everyone else says, the bad guys sucked, the love story sucked, Reeve was great, the effects were the same, he story sucked, except for one part which was gold.The bad Superman idea was gold, GOLD. So good I consider the Superman vs Superman scene as the best in any of the Superman movies. I just wish the rest of this movie lived up to this one scene's goldness, yes thats right GOLDNESS.Hang on, don't forget the random scene where Superman blows out the Olympic Candle, a random skit that was made for cheap laughs. Did not exactly show him off as evil did it? Now, why I believe this movie was brought to us by KFC.First, it was placed in the hall way broom cupboard as Gus was walking to and from the computer room in Smallville.Second, 'You know that chicken in the bucket, nobody knows that secret recipe that makes it taste so good ' Third, and last, Ricky is eating a nice piece of plump chicken on his first night in the big city.",Superman III

Okay, as suggested by other reviewers, the story and script are not as strong as the first two films but this one is entertaining nonetheless. For me, it strikes a good balance between action & comedy, and suitably takes the story forward, albeit in a slightly different direction. Nothing wrong with it. Can't believe the average score on here, hence my review to nudge it in the right direction.",Superman III
