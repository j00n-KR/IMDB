Then Gracie goes missing. Abe grows up unable to solve the mystery. Then he gets his first murder case. A boy was stabbed 17 times. His girlfriend (Sophie Nélisse) of 3 months asks him to solve the case.Abe (Adam Brody) does unorthodox things like break into people's homes and snoop. He asks simple straight forward questions and solves cases without any theatrics. Simple and mildly enjoyable mystery.Guide: F-word. brief nudity.,The Kid Detective
1,deloudelouvain,Not bad at all.,7,12 August 2021,"The Kid Detective, not really a title that is very appealing, but the truth is that this movie is certainly entertaining. The humor is most of the time subtle. To me the mystery level is what makes this movie stand out. I don't know if the humor was really necessary to make this a good movie. But it's there, subtle and dark at times, it made me giggle a couple times, not rolling over from laughing but good enough to make me grin. The plot is well written, definitely the best thing about The Kid Detective. Nice twists, and an ending that will surprise more than one. The acting was good and that from the whole cast. Better than I expected to be honest.",The Kid Detective
2,cherold,interesting premise handled well,7,5 February 2021,"What if The Hardy Boys or Nancy Drew kept on detecting as adults? It's hard to imagine, simply because you never think of them as growing up, but The Kid Detective suggests a possible scenario.In this private detective dramedy, Abe Applebaum was a town celebrity; a whiz kid with a talent for detecting. Now he's 30 and is still pursuing the same penny-ante cases of his childhood - missing pets and digging up info on relatives. You just have to ignore the absurdity that the cases he handles would be enough to pay a secretary (amusing and dourly played by Veep's Sarah Sutherland).Then Abe gets a serious case; a girl's boyfriend was stabbed and the police are flummoxed. It's the first really important case he's had since a kid-era case that doesn't appear to have gone well, but he pursues it doggedly and often foolishly.This is a rather odd movie. It starts light and comedic but gets darker as it moves along. The end is actually downright grim, and that's not really what you're expecting at the beginning.I didn't really enjoy the last half hour as much as the rest, but it's hard for me to separate my feelings about the movie from the fact that an hour into the movie I got into a brief spat with my girlfriend that I expected to blow up when we had a chance to talk more, and I was very stressed after that. It's possible that if not for that I might have given the movie an 8.Anyway, if you like detective movies and find the premise appealing it's definitely worth checking out.",The Kid Detective
3,A_Different_Drummer,milestone for Morgan ********,8,20 December 2020,Morgan as writer and director announces himself to the world with the rare combination of tight script and masterful direction. What starts off as simply a single clever idea gradually becomes a unique story in its own right. In the same rarified air as Rian Johnson's BRICK.,The Kid Detective
4,westsideschl,Suppose to Be Humorous?,4,30 March 2021,"Pranks & petty crimes coupled with Sherlock level observational deductions results in our celebrity kid detective growing up coasting & declining to near homelessness, but still reliant on the community's good graces from his past exploits, e.g. Free ice cream for life. He finally solves the big one (not clear how) getting a confession from the stereotyped, least expected guilty one. Ending seemed forced/artificial.",The Kid Detective
5,ops-52535,im sure that...,4,15 December 2020,"There are kid detectives out there in the real world, that can deal with a worse case scenario than in this film. And do not think this is a childrens movie when reading the word ''kid'' in the filmtitle.Its a detective story, with hush hush crimodelia like storyline, with child abuse, kidnapping, suicide, crooked prominent members of society and lots of personal memorabilia and flashbacks. The acting just about average.Productionwise its a fine filmographic presentation, the story intricat and complex, but how its plotted in a very slow composure, make this film subjectively feel actually one hour longer than it is, and the enhanced soundleveled musical score is bad taste and earpinning in my tinnititious ears.So if your out for a kidsherlock flick there are at least 100 made since year 2000, see them first says the grumpy old man, it not a film i will revisit later on, because its dead slow and dull, its like a real jump off the turn of an anticlimax at a swinger party, therefore a no recommend.",The Kid Detective

Bored to freaking death!",1,11 February 2021,"This film start with a girl ""Gracie"" walking at the street, and a man ""Abe"" waking up scene! As turnout, this film is about Abe need to find out who kill Caroline's boyfriend, he eventually find out Principal Erwin killed Caroline's boyfriend, and kidnap Gracie! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the driving scene, overuse of the drinking scene, overuse of the taking pill scene, overuse of the eating scene, overuse of the song playing at the background scene, overuse of the watching TV scene, overuse of the walking scene, overuse of the searching things scene, and overuse of the staring scene!

8,henry8-3,The Kid Detective,7,18 August 2021,"A once famous child detective who solved hundreds of cases around town and in school grows up to be something of a failure as an adult (Brody), haunted by the disappearance years ago of a girl who helped him. One day a girl turns up (Nelisse) asking him to solve the murder of her boyfriend.Well executed comedy thriller with some genuinely funny scenes throughout as Brody does his best to investigate with little or no information and no support from family and friends. His somber, half drunken / stoned approach makes for an amusing character to be with. Interestingly about 30 minutes from the end it all gets very dark indeed as the fog clears for Brody. A really good effort.",The Kid Detective
9,aidanratesmovies,One of the Great Hidden Gems of 2020,10,27 May 2021,"I'm not gonna lie, this film took me completely by surprise. I have always liked Adam Brody as an actor, but it's in this film we truly see him able to prove himself in a leading role, and he does an absolutely fantastic job- in honestly one of my favorite performances from the films of 2020. The Kid Detective was largely swept under the rug by most moviegoers, as it was shortly dumped in theaters in the fall of last year. I had heard good things about it, but lacked much of a desire to see it. However, the movie eventually made its way to the library where I decided to give it a watch, and I was completely shook by the time it was over. Not only do I regret not seeing the film in theaters, but it's also inspired me a bit more about movies in general. That it may just be still possible to make a good original film with a major studio this day and age, among all the sequels, franchises, and remakes out there. The film is complex, dark, and quite funny- its script is well fleshed out and incredibly well edited and paced. It never feels like too much or too little. It never feels like it's holding your hand or stuffing its hardship down your throat, it simply is a brilliant and well done mystery- and I couldn't be more pleased with it if I tried. The cinematography is excellent, a nostalgic view of a small middle class american town, and its soundtrack is incredibly fitting- providing the audience with classic tunes that lend the film to a more nostalgic tone- incredibly well set for its classic mystery inspired setup. In the end, The Kid Detective is easily the best mystery/thriller i've seen in quite a long time, and easily one of the best films of 2020.My Rating: 10/10.",The Kid Detective
10,Sergiodave,Caught me by surprise,7,21 December 2020,"The Kid Detective starts out as a fairly run of the mill amateur sleuth movie, something not too distant from 'Murder She Wrote'. Luckily I didn't quit the film because it then turns very surprisingly dark. Well acted and directed with an ingenious plot , this movie will leave you thinking long after the credits have rolled.",The Kid Detective
11,blott2319-1,"Smart, darkly funny, and a good mystery to boot",9,18 February 2021,"The Kid Detective is a clever idea. Considering all the books and TV shows that have been made about young kids acting as detectives, it's kind of fun to explore what might become of one of those kids when they grow up. In this case it's a darkly comedic look at a man who never fully matured and failed to move on with his life, because of one particular mystery that he was never able to solve. I was able to connect quite well to the comedic tone of this film. It's not traditional jokes, but a subtle undertone of dark comedy, and I could see some people watching the movie without even sensing that it is intended to be funny. It plays on a number of the tropes that most of us know from when we were growing up reading/watching things like the Hardy Boys, Scooby-Doo, etc.Perhaps I wouldn't have as much fun with The Kid Detective if it weren't for the fact that there was also a solid mystery woven into the whole thing. It would have been easy for them to just play with the concept and then leave it there with a by-the-numbers story. However, I was genuinely puzzled by this film, and had trouble putting the pieces together, even though they do a decent job of slowly revealing clues along the way. It's a well-written whodunnit with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing. I also appreciate that there are layers to the mystery, and we are never completely sure if this kid was ever a good detective at all. Since the flashbacks are stylized in a way to make them feel like his own personal recollection of how he remembers things, we are left wondering if he was as good as his memories made him out to be.Adam Brody did a solid job in the lead role, and he sold all the emotion of The Kid Detective. There are a number of scenes where there isn't much going on, but you can sense the importance of those moments based on Brody's expression (or lack thereof.) Sophie Nélisse is his co-star, but she doesn't get quite enough to do in the film. I was hoping she would play a more active role in the investigation rather than just tagging along. It is vital that she not be around for some scenes, though, and her somewhat hands-off role as ""the client"" makes sense because this film is also emulating a classic film noir. All these genres meshed quite well, and made for a movie that I found surprisingly entertaining, and will definitely recommend to others.",The Kid Detective
12,0w0,A fairly good dark comedy,7,8 January 2021,"'The Kid Detective' isn't great or fantastic or anything like that, but it certainly isn't a bad movie. The acting is good, the story is intriguing and it does enough other things well to not be boring or stale throughout the entire movie. I would call it a dark comedy although I only laughed once throughout the entire movie, so don't expect a laugh-a-minute movie or anything like that, it's just humorous enough without actually making you laugh, since the entire movie is dark and somber due to the subject matter that it deals with plus the two main characters being very somber themselves. Overall it's a fine movie and worth watching at least once.",The Kid Detective
13,trinaboice,Dark humor and mystery that will leave you speechless,9,26 October 2020,"IN A NUTSHELL:
This quirky dramedy blends dark humor, mystery, sadness, intrigue, and profound insight. It's a detective story layered with a coming-of-age story and a surprise gut punch. The movie is written and directed by Evan Morgan. I'm now a fan and can't wait to see more from him. Its unconventional look at murder and humor reminded me of the movie Knives Out.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Talk of a ""concubine.""
Some profanity
You see a man snort lines of cocaine.
Talk of inappropriate behavior.
You see the naked backside of a man.
You see the front of a naked woman wearing a mask that covers her face.
You see a bloody suicide.
Murder
Lots of alcohol.THEMES:
Coming-of-age
Earning respect
How it feels when no one takes you seriously.
The theme I thought was the most interesting and compelling was one voiced by Adam Brody's character. He said, ""It's difficult to accept who you are in your head and who you really are.""
Balance
Everyone has secrets.
Is the truth worth knowing?THINGS I LIKED:
Adam Brody gives a stellar performance in this role.
I loved Sophie Nelisse in The Book Thief and haven't seen her in anything else since. She was perfect in her role in this movie too.
The subtle humor is hilarious.
Abe Applebaum's terrible receptionist was funny and should be fired.
Even the side characters are interesting.
Several surprising twists.
There is a fascinating juxtaposition of sweet, upbeat music and a terrible crime unfolding right before your eyes.
The ending gives you a chance to exhale and release your own feelings, along with the protagonist. It's powerful.
There is a film noir feel to it but with a more modern spin.
Effective editing.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
It starts off quickly, then starts to drag as you try to figure out how things are related.
A lot of people mumble, making it difficult to know what's going on.
The last 20 minutes of the movie are jaw-dropping and take the movie in a direction you don't quite expect, leaving you utterly speechless.You can watch my full review on my Movie Review Mom channel.",The Kid Detective

This movie is extremely slow paced and boring. The movie wasn't terrible I just thought it was very mediocre and didn't really go anywhere. Basic 5 star movie C-,The Kid Detective

17,whitemanfromtowne,Not bad at all.,6,17 December 2020,"This was a ver decent murder mystery. Not bad at all. A very decent story and easy to follow. No action, vulgarity, or gore. If you like sleuth storie, then you wont be disappointed. A definite recommended.",The Kid Detective
18,MogwaiMovieReviews,Nice Enough But Nothing New,5,16 April 2021,"A crime-solving child grows up, still haunted by the one case he never solved.There's an awful lot of films these days much like this, that feel as though they are cut and pasted from other creations. I don't know why that is, whether it is because of studio interference and too many test screenings, or just that the people making them have so little lived life of their own to put into their work that all they can do is refer to other movies. It was fun when Tarantino started doing it, but now it's as though the generation that followed just have no ideas of their own at all.I'm not saying The Kid Detective is in any way a really bad movie, only that it feels as though almost any film student could have knocked it up after watching Rushmore, Brick, and Magnolia with a notepad on their lap. It has no recognizable feel or voice of its own, and no real thrills or surprises of any kind. It's still a likeable-enough little film, and the mystery at the heart of it is solid enough, it's just I know I won't remember a single thing about it this time next year.",The Kid Detective
19,shashrvacai,Good film,6,5 May 2021,"Good film, detailed, wellmade, complete film Would recommend to atleast watch once.",The Kid Detective
20,FKDZ,Enjoyable but tedious at times,6,9 July 2021,"I'm kinda split on this movie. Personally my biggest gripe with it is it's pacing and runtime length. I think it really could've cut down and become a much more effective movie.The melancholy is heavy here, and I can't really call this a straight up comedy though maybe thats because the jokes just didn't really do it for me. It is very much a dry dark comedy dramaBut I love the character study, it's preformed great and just so gripping to watch. If anything this movie is about 1 main character. There really isn't much else. And it takes you in.The music, either intentional or unintentional was great it completely symbolized the uptrend and failure of his attempts, how his mentality changed after just a single setback. I do love the ending though. It fully completed the movie imo.Directing was good, some nice shots and in general a good looking film. Just felt a bit bland here and there.All in all though, its not something I would watch again, I don't know if I would have to patience to sit through it again.",The Kid Detective
21,scythertitus,Free Ice Cream,8,16 March 2021,"This movie is a great look at 'what happens next', holding true to this idea even at the end. There is a certain cynical tone that is self-reflective, both on what is real and why we hope. So it gives you a lot to unpack.At the same time there is a lot of fun to be had here, especially if you enjoy dark comedy. All the performances are great and everyone knows what they are doing. It's very much a self aware movie that has lots of things to say, but has fun with it at the same time.Overall I found this really enjoyable, and it's not even necessarily something I would be into otherwise. Has serious Brick vibes, so if you loved that you will probably love this, even though in some ways it is the exact opposite.",The Kid Detective
22,Harshithnagraj,Accidentally found,10,13 June 2021,One the most underrated movie of 2020. I sat down to watch this without any expectations but turned out to be a fabulous ride it worth the 2 hours spent by me. Without expectations it crossed my level. I don't judge this. Go and decide your self good or bad.,The Kid Detective
23,therealjaysmoke,"Ok movie, but very slow paced.",5,8 February 2021,"Dang, Sophie Nelissé is beautiful. The whole plot didn't really make sense, it was slooooow and I almost fell asleep several times. I loved the cinematography though, and with a pretty face like Sophie in almost every scene, you certainly won't get tired of watching. But it was rarely funny and I find it hard placing this movie in a category. And was that the worst ending to a movie ever or what???",The Kid Detective
24,witra_as,Adam Brody did wonder in this quirky murder mystery,7,17 August 2021,A quirky murder mystery by Evan Morgan had unconventional steps to reveal the truth.

25,chris_rowe-881-168820,Tale of two films,5,19 August 2021,"The first 50 minutes of this film are awful, rubbish characters, writing and so slow. It's all pretty idiotic and unfunny. I understand losing your sense of what's real in films but if your bf died and your 16 neither make you completely stupid or oblivious.The receptionist was stupid, the logic that the work he's done would land him with staff and an office and be able to rent is so ludicrous. Films a mess.If the second half didn't twist into quite an interesting who dunnit I'd have given the film 2, it got interesting to watch, the main character was just poor and not one you'd like, the only saving graces were the two twists.",The Kid Detective
26,traceytak,Just couldn't enjoy it,4,13 August 2021,I loved Sophie nelisse.in The Book Thief and thought the kid Detective would be good but even she couldn't save this film. It felt like the script was being read on an autocue with everyone determined to get their next line in as soon as they could. The last 15 minutes were the only time that this did not happen and had I not switched off due to boredom from the lead up i may have felt it was a good ending. If the speed of dialogue had been like it was in the ending I think I would have enjoyed it.,The Kid Detective
27,impressivesgirl-37857,A hidden gem!,9,24 April 2021,"I was expecting a Nancy Drew light hearted mistery/comedy that's good for both kids and adults but it was so much more! It was interesting, thrilling, witty and funny alongside dark and mysterious. I think the acting of the main carachters was completely on point - innocent, naive and pretty versus virtued, depressed and sarcastic. Adam Brody surprised me as I did not expect to see him in such a serious role. Very well directed - nice plot, nice ending, everything was perfectly crafted. I am dissappointed that no one is talking about it but it is unexpetedly good and fresh compared to the blockbuster movies nowadays. Recommended if you want to watch something kinda realistic, but captivating, yet youthful.",The Kid Detective

I'm glad I did because I loved this movie.From the beginning it was compelling in a charming, amusing, interesting kind of way.

31,PerryAtTheMovies,Not as fulfilling as I had hoped for.,4,8 November 2020,"Being a detective isn't always the most glamorous job in the world, but this film takes it too far in just how slow and boring it can be. Abe Applebaum, our story protagonist, hates his life and drinks it away as he doesn't have any real cases to work on. This film feels more of a documentary of how life sucks as an adult. Of the entirety of this film only the last 10-15 minutes was enjoyable. (Yes, that's typically how films work) However, there should at least feel like there's some build-up to an ending and this film just doesn't do it. We get minimal blips of life, but ultimately it goes from dead one moment to alive the next and then done, walking out the theatre.Honestly, I'm finding it hard to find words to write a meaningful review on this film. Just like the movie, I'm all over the place and wish I could give you more, but alas you're left thinking, ""What was that?"" Overall, I could only recommend watching this film on a streaming service. At least if you're going to fall asleep, you can do it at home.",The Kid Detective

The Radio Show All About the Movies"": Adam Brody was excellent.. and so were other actors.. but what a LET DOWN!! I hate the fact I watched this movie because if I watch a movie, I WANT an ending. If I want to ""write my own ending"" to a story, I'm not going to watch another person's movie. Whoever made this.. wrote the story, or produced it.. I want to ask WHY? WHY did you NOT finish what you started? You could have added as little as ONE minute of context.. maybe two, and made a GREAT movie! Instead you did NOT end it or explain WHY. Though this isn't a spoiler, I would suggest to others to keep your expectations LOW. I'm mad at the people who made this movie because they just wimped out. I gave it a 4 out of 10.

36,lusciousmuffins,Darker than you'd think,9,6 July 2021,"This showed up under comedies when I was searching for a movie to watch, which was about as far from what it is as you can get.This is actually much closer to a film noir, updated ever so slightly for the modern era.Most importantly, this is a well constructed story, albeit a very dark one.While there are a few points where this movie drags a little, it is well constructed overall.Extra credit should also go to the actors in this film who really did some outstanding work.Other than minor issues with pace, this really is an outstanding movie that deserves more attention and praise than it got.It's unfortunate that with so many god awful films being foisted upon the public that something that is as engaging as this does not get the recognition it deserves.One can only hope that the makers of this film are afforded more opportunities in the future to hone their skills and produce even more stories that challenge the audience the way this one did.",The Kid Detective
37,tlooknbill,"Encyclopedia Brown, boy detective, becomes Jeff Lebowski in Canadian suburbia.",9,29 October 2020,"Canadian made movies seem to create a dream like parallel ""more innocent"" American universe which is what I felt watching this ""Ghost World"" like indie film of a boy detective now attempting to solve his first murder mystery as a young man but in the same suburbs he grew up in as a boy solving minor issues and mysteries asked by his school mates which is hilarious if not endearing on its own as it's illustrated quite humorously in flashbacks.It is this localization of his connection and familiarity with the community that cleverly aids him in solving a missing person and recent stabbing of an Asian boy reminiscent of a Columbo episode but in a Napoleon Dynamite kind of droll community. It's clunky, slow paced and pretty sloppy as it slogs and meanders along eventually leading to the ultimate pay off but in the most disturbing scene considering its innocent suburbia setting.This is a smartly made movie and I thoroughly enjoyed it for its mix of humor and unusual methods of sleuthing by knowing the community better than the cops who were also solving the same missing persons and murder cases.The ending is a big surprise but not as usual surprise endings go in detective movies because it's as slow paced and unassuming as if you're watching someone clear the table after a potluck dinner making it just weird and disturbing but in a thought provoking way. I certainly didn't see it coming.",The Kid Detective

40,kaideneve,Was not expecting to love this,9,14 June 2021,"Came in expecting a Hardy Boys kind of experience with a few campy jokes and a formulaic teen mystery plot headlined by the guy from The OC. It was a lazy rainy Sunday and I had time.What I experienced was a superbly written dark comedy with some genuine laugh out loud moments and a tight, clean plot with no unnecessary fluff that ends in an unexpected way. Adam Brody was excellent as the main character who evolved from a genius kid detective to an apathetic burnout 30-something who took on cases like finding an old lady's missing cat.All aspects of this production are great, but I think my favorite part about it is that it doesn't try to be unnecessarily complicated despite technically being a murder mystery. The script is playful with just the right amount of serious emotion. Interesting and well-acted characters throughout. I think it would make an excellent mini-series.",The Kid Detective

44,ChrisInMiami,A perfectly balanced mystery and dark comedy. A must see.,8,20 June 2021,"Abe Applebaum grew up a boy genius, idolized in his small hometown for solving all manner of minor crimes. He's part Encyclopedia Brown part lost Hardy boy, but his bright future took a dark turn when he failed to locate a missing teenager. Flash forward 15 years, he can't find any respect from the town, his former clients, his Secretary or even his parents. His potential never realized, the only cases he can pick up are lost pets and kids spying on their parents. It affords him just enough for a Secretary and beer money but not enough for his own apartment or a car. When a murdered teenager's girlfriend 'hires' him to solve the crime, he just might find some redemption.Writer-director Evan Morgan has crafted one of the tightest scripts I've seen in years and finds the perfect balance of dark comedy and mystery. It's Chinatown on a budgetary diet and there's a mastery of dialogue/subtext and foreshadowing/payoff. He's created a cynical satire of the children's mysteries I grew up reading and it works on every level. Adam Brody as Abe proves once again he's not just the OC teenage heartthrob...he's got the skills that make Abe feel real and fun at the same time. The supporting cast are all great as well.Sadly this seems to be one of the gems that got lost in the Covid year of movie misery. I found it on Starz ((June 2021) and I don't think you'd be disappointed to hunt it out for yourself. In fact I'd love to see another Abe Applebaum mystery.Remember the days when you would wander around the video store looking for something independent you could tell your friends about? This is it.8/10.",The Kid Detective
45,themadcamel,"Starts of cute, gets clever, turns dark.",7,12 March 2021,"In a year riddled with average films this one floats to the top. It's a great premise, kid detective (cliche) becoming an alcoholic in adulthood; I think a lot could relate to the reality of that. And the comedy in that idea is sharp and works well. But what really makes this film shine is just how f$@king how real it gets. Worth a watch.",The Kid Detective
46,tenyearreunion,A melting pot of...well...who knows?,5,4 July 2021,"This isn't a bad movie. This isn't, in my opinion, a good movie. It is just, well, a bit of everything and nothing. I would love to sit the director down and ask a few questions as I have no idea who they made this movie for or what was intended. I need enlightenment.It is a drama, thriller, comedy, mystery? I'm watching the movie and wondering what am I supposed to be enjoying. I was neither finding it funny, enthralling, creepy or anything. Unfortunately I had literally no emotional connection to this story at all and it was sheer hope that kept me going.One could argue to create a movie that you couldn't 'pigeon hole' is a gift but surely, at least, I should be happy I spent the running time watching it?I've seen reviews that have praised this as being full of dark humour in appropriate places. Well, they must have completely gone over my head, however truth be told, this is entirely possible.If you are reading this, do not let it stop you watching it. Many on here have rated it favourably and it obviously hit the mark with some people. For me, nothing. Nothing at all. Maybe I should be a bit jealous of those that did enjoy it.

I had no idea what to expect and was so glad I had read nothing about it beforehand as I then had no expectations.It's a very well written and well acted indie dark comedy that didn't make me laugh out loud but I appreciated its overall quirky tone and subtle humor. It gets darker as it goes along and we realize that the formerly successful kid detective is actually trying to solve the case. He's had very little success as an adult detective and regrets that he didn't solve the case of a missing schoolgirl back in his early teens. It takes you in a surprising direction with an ending that I never saw coming. It was fairly lightweight but consistent in mood and tone, execution and dialog.....totally entertaining. The two leads were perfect together and everyone turned in stellar performances.",The Kid Detective

Very intelligent but kind of full of himself solve cases for kids and adults (small crimes). Suddenly a real case the missing girl Grace emerge. He could not solve it and he was not as certain of himself as he once was. Fast forward to him as a adult and he is depressed into substance abuse and still a detective of minor cases. Suddenly a real case again emerge. This time a kid has been stabbed to death 17 times and his girlfriend want to know who did it.This movie evoke a broad range of emotions.

The script is solid, the plot is entertaining, the acting is overall pretty decent, and the direction is discreet but spot on.The film starts out as a comedy, and it keeps its light tone for the most part, but then it slowly grows into something more intimate and deep.The last scene is so simple and true, I loved it. It manages to convey the whole sense of isolation, the solitude and the loss of purpose that Abe has been battling since he was a boy. He is loved, but he is not truly understood from his family or his city. Only Caroline knows how he feels, but she is too young and she is struggling with her own personal demons.",The Kid Detective

62,Holland_March,Far better than it has any right to be,10,20 January 2021,"I'm honestly shocked at how well this film turned out. Whatever I expected this to be, it turned out far better. Adam Brody gave an amazing performance, somewhat similar to a live action BoJack Horseman in this movie (obviously with detectives instead of actors). The comedy is really good too, the film knows how to make the audience laugh and when it's appropriate to do so. Not every line is hilarious, but a majority of the jokes tend to land. A sign of a good movie is, despite however much comedy it is, it's plot is well thought out, unpredictable, and possibly one of the most well done mysteries I've seen. It fits perfectly with the tone, plot, and characters. And the ending! The ending! Something so different from the rest of the movie, but something that works so well with it! When the film wraps, it leaves you wanting nothing but for Abe Applebaum's next mystery.",The Kid Detective

Adam Brody is one of those actors you cant help but like, well, for me at least. I remember him being touted for big things back in his OC days, but it never seemed to pan out that way. Wether or not that was by choice, I don't know, but he still has the goods and that's never been more evident as it is in The Kid Detective. Without giving anything away, Brody knocks it out of the park as a jaded ex-child detective who lost the respect of his hometown after failing to solve a single case years back. So much of his identity is tied up with this boy-genius detective persona that he struggles to make a meaningful adult life for himself years later and his failure still haunts him. There's lots of subtle, and not so subtle dark humour, great performances and a fairly big twist to look forward to. After his cameo in Shazam and now this, I can only hope we see more of Brody in the future.",The Kid Detective

I am close to 30 years old now with many responsibilities and I appreciated being able to relax at the end of a workday.My unwarranted guess is that if you are less than 20 years old, you're better off watching a more action-filled movie.A less-than-20-year-old may also rather like a movie which includes more virtue signalling and contemporary political opinions.

I have one nitpick is that there is big reveal in the movie which turns out to be red herring and I wish they explored it more because I think it went into the one of the themes of the movie. A big tragedy happens in the small town, Willowbrook, and it's viewed like the thing that took away the town's innocence. But the little peaks into Willowbrook show that it isn't case at all. The concept of balance is brought up, doing something good to make up for something bad. The resolution of the movie deconstructs this notion all together.",The Kid Detective

86,cos_i_cant,Everyone has secrets !,8,20 October 2021,"What a strange film with a disturbing plot that just pulls you down a rabbit hole,
Set between two main time lines the story unfolds about, you guessed it a kid detective who in small town America attempts to use his problem solving passion to help his little town.All goes array when a missing girl case hitts to close to home , cut to about 17 years later when a still active detective now in his early 30s and dissilusioned with his work and town is hired by a client with a murder to solve , life hasn't been easy and people seem to have lost there faith and love in there prodigal son what's worse he has lost it in himself cam a pure sole bring him back from the abbiss or is his self-destruction an inevitably.We follow th detective on a case that seems to to look like his last, in a town that doesn't care any more and trust was lost 17 years ago.I won't spoil the plot but it's definitely worth a watch not an easy subject but approached with tact and humour black though it may be and a story that will keep you guessing till the end. Feels strange to say I enjoyed the film but I lost track of time and didn't see the end comming which for a who done it is always a good sign will be interesting to see what other think of it.",The Kid Detective

92,nelupap,Not a movie for the average child,10,9 October 2021,"I do give 10/10 to movies I plan to rewatch. What movies one likes, are much more a matter of taste than of stylistic perfection. In my grading scheme, a movie is great if it's a satisfying experience. I would still appreciate the movie for its philosophy, message, style, acting performances, character and plot development, but I think all those matter only marginally compared to the overall experience, which is a really subjective factor.To get to the soulless part of the evaluation, I think the movie should get:
10/10 - message, subtext
10/10 character development
4/10 the villain
6/10 for murder mystery story
9/10 for the tight direction
9/10 for acting performances
7/10 for the sets
3/10 for the comedy...
You get the idea, technically it's above the average.But, overall, I rated the movie 10/10, in other words, awesome. Frankly, I didn't care so much about the murder-mystery part of the story, which is the skeleton upon which the movie is built. The most interesting to me was the main character, a still young man, stuck chasing his childhood dream. And while he's still stuck doing the same job he was doing as a child, the whole world around him has moved on, to other things.When someone finally trusts him to investigate a murder case, he sees it as a chance at redemption and dives into it with all his energy, despite the disapproval and embarrassment of the people around him.Maybe not many people are former child prodigies, who ended up living completely anonymous and uninteresting lives, in spite of the burden of expectations put on them by parents and educators. The movie is especially dedicated to those kind people, many of whom would give everything to relive that lost early life glory, if only for a fleeting moment.Most of the normal people go through phases, as they grow up to be adults. At 9, everyone wants to be an astronaut, a plane pilot, or a great athlete and later, they start thinking they could be doctors, teachers or musicians. But, after college, if one is lucky to afford it, people become accountants, insurance agents, bank tellers and all sorts of gray and boring things that life seems to offer. And they think it's all normal, as a part of growing up. In such a world, someone, who still loves doing what they loved doing at the age of 10, is seen as an anomaly, as someone who won't grow up, as a man-child, another word for pathetic loser.And this is what the kid detective really is, in the eyes of everyone, including his parents and former educators. As a result, the kid detective drowns his sadness in alcohol, and when he wakes up, he goes back to searching for lost cats or keys or whatever his community thinks a kid detective should be qualified for.Apart from the great character angle, there is a lot of subtext to the movie. I think the message is that staying true to oneself, chasing one's dreams is quite an expensive hobby. The price for it is losing one's standing in society. Yet, the price for selling out one's dream is one's soul, and hence the dilemma of the movie's hero.Anyway, my recommendation is to go see it, and think about it, as the lack of explosions will allow it. If you have a smart kid, watch it with them.",The Kid Detective

There were a lot more interesting routes the writer/director could have took to make the reveal of the climax more suspenseful visually.

Why create emotional agony when there is enough of it in the real world, where everything seems to end in tears as this film did? Why mirror bitter reality with fiction? A documentary can do that.

104,flynnjo1970,Entertaining...,6,6 June 2021,"I wasn't expecting much going into this film but was pleasantly surprised. The mystery is not bad, not complex by any stretch of the imagination but compelling enough to keep you interested on a Sunday or rainy afternoon. Technically it is a by the numbers mystery and plays on most of those classic tropes. One thing that it does fairly well - as long as you are ok with suspending some reality - is creating a good relationship between Abe (the kid detective now a 31 yr. Old) and his teenage client, Caroline. I am not going to give a synopsis since the IMDB gives all the necessary info; I will say that the chemistry among the leads is engaging. The direction is a little maudlin but again, for what it is it's not bad, but definitely not stellar nor innovative . The concept is definitely a strong draw, at least to me, and the primary reason I decided to give it a chance. I think of it as Encyclopedia Brown grows up an unfulfilled prodigy, stumped by a case from his childhood. The resolution of the case unfolds nicely (if you're paying attention it's pretty easy to figure out). So again, it's fun, but to put it in perspective it is no Brick (Rian Johnson., 2005), neither in storytelling, filmmaking, nor performance. Adam Brody (as Abe) carries the role well, but again, he doesn't pop off the screen the way JG Levitt does as Brendan in Brick. If you are a teen and just getting into gumshoe type mysteries it's a good place to start but again Brick is far superior. I would watch it again if I'm lazing around on a Sunday.",The Kid Detective

107,astroluc1,Oh my god... superb.,9,26 July 2021,"I've always been a fan of dark comedies, existential comedies, anyting a little more left-of-center than the norm. That being said a lot of movies that try to be different tend to be either too on the nose, to random just for the sake of Randomness, or somebody else's idea of funny... That I totally don't agree with. But this movie...
... this is more of a no spoiler reaction rather than a review, as I am not a Critic. However I will say that this movie is incredibly nuanced, incredibly well acted, and simultaneously funny, heartwarming, horrifying, and a real exploration into the main character's psyche. Taking a step back from the actual content of the material, it can be metaphorical to how so many of us approach the realities of existence.This will either sound like a glowing recommendation or totally put you off of the movie, but please don't let anything I say discourage you from seeing it... It is excellent.",The Kid Detective

This is an instant purchase to live on my shelf with some of my favorite movies of all time.It's rare for a movie to make laugh out loud. It's even rarer for a movie to make me feel like I'm going to throw up. This movie managed both of them within a half hour of each other.Evan Morgan's dark, dry wit is boosted by a masterful performance by Adam Brody.",The Kid Detective
