0,TheLittleSongbird,One bland grey,3,1 February 2018,"Judging from reading the reviews, 'The Grey' is a very polarising film. Understandably. As has been said in other films, some people liked or loved it, others disliked or hated it. My main reason for seeing 'The Grey' was Liam Neeson, an actor who is never less than watchable and has been known to be very good regardless of what the rest of the film is like. Didn't outright hate 'The Grey', there are a few (emphasis on few) things done right and there are far worse films, naming them and summing them up would fill a whole book series or several of them. It isn't even the worst film with Neeson, that dishonour out of the ones personally seen is 'Taken 3'. Having said that, very much disliked it on the most part. Contrary to what has been written in many of the negative reviews, there is much more wrong to the film than being factually inaccurate even though there was illogic and unintentional ridiculousness as a result. Thank goodness for Neeson, by far the best thing about 'The Grey'. He had a lot on his shoulders to carry the film, being the lead and being crucial to stopping the film from being worse than it could have been. He is more than up to the task and gives a magnetic gravitas that was not present in the acting of the rest of the cast.Neeson apart, there are a couple of other redeeming qualities. The landscape is both bleakly atmospheric and strikingly beautiful, with moments of photography that matches that quality. Then there are the scene-stealing wolves, while they are genuinely menacing and like Neeson deserved a much better film they are also characters that one roots for far more than any of the human characters. Other than those redeeming qualities the rest of 'The Grey' doesn't work. The photography, as said, has moments, but mostly it's very slipshod and murky. The editing is choppy and not always coherent, especially in the action, while one does not expect to see effects this low-budget and at least 10 years out of date. Music is largely unmemorable and the direction is workmanlike at best and more often than not struggles badly to reach even that. With the sole exception of Neeson, the acting is very indifferent though in fairness a lot of them have little to work with with such a bland, bare bones script and emotionally un-investable characters.Biggest problems are the pacing and the story. The pace is pedestrian and the constant lack of suspense, tension and excitement severely hurts it. The story's action is under-utilised and when there is any it's poorly edited, ridiculous and dully choreographed. The psychological elements were an intriguing idea, executed in a crying out for more meat on the bones way, further disadvantaged by that none of the characters are interesting. Suspense and tension is next to nil, while the film is rife with ridiculousness and parts that are illogical. The cliff scene is an embarrassment. Overall, the colour grey has rarely been this bland. 3/10 Bethany Cox",The Grey
1,Leofwine_draca,Tough survivalist thriller,6,18 April 2014,"THE GREY boasts nothing new in its depiction of a team of plane survivors struggling to survive in the freezing wilderness as they find themselves picked off one by one by both the elements and a pack of ravenous wolves, but it does have a strictly non-Hollywood vibe going on which makes it more than watchable.This is a tough survivalist thriller boasting another hard-man turn from ageing action star Liam Neeson, once again playing it taciturn as a guy who finds himself forced to pit his wits against Mother Nature. As expected, there are the usual expendable characters in the cast list who find themselves getting bumped off one by one either by chance or through their own errors, and such formats are always easy to digest for viewers who want to switch off their brains for a couple of hours.Director Joe Carnahan certainly directs his snow backdrops well, and there's a level of gritty realism to the whole thing which gives it an edge over rival products; it's also a huge step up from Carnahan's previous movie, the execrable A-TEAM. It might be slightly too depressing and pessimistic to fully enjoy it as a movie, but for the most part THE GREY does everything right.",The Grey
2,SnoopyStyle,Hunted by wolves,6,18 September 2013,Oil workers in Alaska are flying home when suddenly their plane crashes. There are seven survivors and the wolves start to approach. Outdoors hunter John Ottway (Liam Neeson) leads the group into the forest to escape the predators.It's a pretty good intense simple chase movie at the start. The premise seems easy and holds plenty of potential. There are a few too many slow spots for me and it loses momentum. The actors do a solid job especially Neeson. The story has too many unrealistic moments. All too often they seem to run unrealistically fast in deep snow ahead of the wolves. The wolves should easily catch them out in the open. There is a great section where the wolves attack at night. My expectations were high and it's a little disappointing.,The Grey
3,Hitchcoc,Too Many Wolves,6,11 July 2014,"I like Liam Neeson and the premise is good. A group of hard living men in a non-tenuous setting, find themselves in the frozen wasteland of Alaska after their plan crashes. It sound exciting, doesn't it. The problem here is that somehow the interaction among the men doesn't click. I can't explain it, other than I didn't really know these men. They were, to some extent, caricatures, with little depth. Neeson goes from being the stoic wolf killer to taken leadership as the men go, god knows where, trying to survive. They are pursued by wolves that take on an almost supernatural role. There is a sense of hopelessness and despair that overrides everything they try to do. They are scared and have every right to be. They explain why there is no one out looking for them, but it really doesn't wash. I know that Alaska is the new old West, but why are these guys so expendable and why would a commercial airplane, with a flight attendant and a professional pilot, not be on the must-save list. It's like the writer and director didn't know where to go.",The Grey
4,claudio_carvalho,Bleak and Depressive Tale of Survival,6,23 June 2012,"In Alaska, a team of oil workers fly to the site; however, they cross a storm and the airplane crashes. Only seven workers survive in the wilderness and John Ottway (Liam Neeson), who is a huntsman that kills wolves to protect the workers, assumes the leadership of the group. Shortly after they learn that they are surrounded by a pack of wolves and Ottway advises that they should seek protection in the woods. But while they walk through the heavy snow, they are chased and attacked by the carnivorous mammals. ""The Grey"" is a bleak and depressive film about a group of survivors of a plane crash that is chased by a pack of wolves and fights to survive in the wilderness of Alaska. The story is scary and the locations and shootings are very impressive. It is also amazing the shift in the career of sixty year-old Liam Neeson to action and thriller films after the death of his wife and how credible he is despite his age. If you see the film, wait until the end of the credits to see the winner of the final battle. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""A Perseguição"" (""The Pursuit"")",The Grey
5,kosmasp,"Drained, but really good",8,18 September 2012,"A survival story that is really good and horrific. It starts off pretty slow and solid. You meet up with a crew of people (Liam Neesons character being the one who's starring), before all ""hell"" breaks out. It's more of a character study and a what would you do in a situation like that. Of course you will be praying that Liam Neeson is with you, in case you find yourself in such trouble.There are quite a few jump scares along the ride, but the major part is not the action, but connection between the individuals ... and nature of course. Also if you have the time and like Audio Commentaries do listen to the one on the disc with this. It's more than light and funny, a complete opposite to the mood of the film. Kudos to the director for being so versatile. And the action looks more than realistic (so great DP too) which is all rounded up by a great sound design.",The Grey
6,Sleepin_Dragon,Not as bad as some say.,6,23 October 2015,"I'd seen trailers for this movie, and I don't know why but I thought it was going to be some kind of supernatural thriller, I had no idea it was going to be a man vs beast film. I am so surprised by so many of the highly negative comments, I rather enjoyed it, I'll take the point that the behaviour of the wolves was perhaps not totally accurate (I don't profess to be an expert.) There were enough shocks, and plenty of tense moments to keep my interest, Wolves are fascinating animals, I wouldn't like to be surrounded by them! So it's not Liam Neeson's best film, credit to him though because he's starred in some awesome movies, this was very different for him. I was surprised by the distinct lack of frost bite.",The Grey
7,lee_eisenberg,no one goes down without a fight,6,5 July 2012,"Movies like ""Strawdogs"" and ""Deliverance"" dealt with bringing out man's inner beast. ""The Grey"" takes it to the extreme, as Liam Neeson and a bunch of other men crash in the Alaskan wilderness and get targeted by hungry wolves. In a way, the humans become as ferocious as the lupines. Of course, the wolves have the advantage of inhabiting the forest, so the people have no choice but to be as violent as possible.Liam Neeson seems to have recently starred in a lot of movies playing a normally calm man who turns aggressive (some of what he did in ""Taken"" looked like torture). Bill Maher jokingly proposed that all of Neeson's movies now have to be called ""I'm Going to Rip Your Face Off"". But in the end, ""The Grey"" is a fun, intense romp.",The Grey
8,jboothmillard,The Grey,6,23 October 2012,"I am sure that I saw a short trailer for this film, and being a fan of the leading actor starred in hit films like Batman Begins and Taken in recent years I thought it was good enough to give a go, from director Joe Carnahan (Smokin' Aces, The A-Team). Basically a group of oil workers are catching a plane home from Alaska, one of them is John Ottway (Liam Neeson) who is responsible for killing wolves that threaten the work, and he has recently been suicidal after the death of his wife. During the flight they experience some turbulence, and eventually the plane is in trouble, starts going down and they crash in the middle of the snowy landscape during a blizzard, Ottway wakes up and finds a few of the other workers still alive as well and helps to calm them down. After letting team member Luke Lewenden (James Badge Dale) die peacefully from his mortal wounds, the remaining survivors of the crash are John Diaz (Frank Grillo), Jerome Talget (Dermot Mulroney), Pete Hendrick (Dallas Roberts), Todd Flannery (Joe Anderson), Jackson Burke (Nonso Anozie) and Hernandez (Ben Bray), and they start doing what they can to survive. They collect materials and build a fire, and while investigating a noise Ottway discovers a gray wolf who then attacks him, the other men save him, and he explains that they must be in wolf territory or near their den, so they all take turns to stay awake and keep watch. Hernandez is attacked and killed by two wolves in the night, so after finding his body Ottway says that they should leave the crash site and find shelter somewhere else because they are open to attack, Diaz questions how he is leader, and before they leave they all collect the wallets of the dead to be returned to their loved ones, and Hendrick says a prayer. They hike across the snow, and being far behind Flannery is attacked and killed next, but the rest eventually reach the woods and make camp, but they are on the run again when an ambush of wolves comes towards them, but a fire is made to keep them away. As makeshift weaponry is made to protect themselves there is tension and a fight between Ottway and Diaz, a knife is even used as threat, but they are stopped when the alpha wolf sends an omega, but they are able to kill him, and they cook and eat it, and mad Diaz cuts off and throws the head back in pride. They move on later and make another fire and camp, and in conversation Diaz doesn't believe there is a God or Heaven for those who died, Talget believes in God, and Ottway confesses he is atheist but he does want to believe, and Burke has hallucinations because of hypoxia (lack of oxygen because of altitude), and the next morning they find him frozen to death. The group walk on and find a high canyon surrounded by trees and see a river below, so Hendrick leaps to the nearest tree to secure a line for each remaining survivor to climb across, Ottway and Diaz make it across, but Talget has a fear of heights, he tries to move along, but he loses his glasses, sees his injured hand is bleeding heavily, and slips to get tangled up in the rope, until the rope snaps and he falls through the tree branches to the ground, and on his last breaths he is taken away by wolves. The last three remaining workers continue on, Diaz badly injured his knee falling from the tree, and he knows that if the other two keep dragging him along they will be slowed down an open for attack, so he pleads them to just leave him and let him die, they try to convince him to change his mind, but they agree to his request and say their goodbyes. Ottway and Hendrick are chased by wolves again, and in the chase Hendrick trips over and falls into the fast flowing river, Ottway chases after him, he is only stopped when his foot gets trapped between rocks under the water, and eventually after trying to be rescued Hendrick drowns, leaving Ottway alone and cursing God to help him, to no avail. Dazed and confused by hypothermia he stops in the snow and takes out all the wallets collected from the dead, placing them in the snow in the shape of a cross, he puts his in too, and then he sees a pack of wolves surround him, he is right in their den, the alpha appears and the other wolves scatter, and Ottway sees one more vision of his dying wife (Anne Openshaw) is hospital telling him not to be afraid, so he quickly breaks miniature alcohol bottles and attaches them to his hand and a knife in the other hand, and after a recital of his father's poem the wolf charges and the film fades to black. There is a final shot at the end where Ottway is lying on the ground, we do not know if he is alive or not, but the alpha wolf looks like it is on its dying breath. Neeson is a good choice to be the self-appointed leader of the surviving plane crash members who has a good knowledge of survival techniques and their attacking creatures, I can what critics mean by this being more a thrilling film than working the dramatic human side of the story, but you can't complain about the sequences where they are doing everything they can to survive, and the wolf attacks are the most exciting parts, overall it is a worthwhile action drama. Good!",The Grey
9,Tweekums,They survived a plane crash but can they survive the Alaskan wilderness?,8,11 February 2019,"John Ottway is a hunter hired to keep wolves away from a remote oil facility in Alaska. However when the plane carrying him, and fellow oil-workers back to Anchorage crashes in the wilderness he finds himself among the hunted. Seven people, including Ottway, survived the crash but there numbers are soon reduced; they are in the territory of a pack of wolves and the weather is extreme. Knowing that their only chance of survival is to move they head to the trees but getting there is nowhere near the end of their troubles. Tempers fray, the wolves get closer and the weather worsens.It may be argued that the behaviour of the wolves isn't realistic but that didn't reduce my enjoyment of the film as the tension was constantly high once it became clear that the plane was going to crash. I wasn't surprised to learn that this was filmed in a real frozen wilderness as one could almost feel the extreme cold. Liam Neeson does a solid job as Ottway; he certainly feels like the sort of person who might survive such a situation. The rest of the characters are less interesting, their constant bickering was a distraction from the real concerns... thankfully as the numbers reduced the characters of the survivors improved somewhat. The story progressed well with various new threats arising as well as the constant threat of the wolves. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of 'man versus dangerous animals' films; it may not be as good as 'Jaws' but it beats most examples of the genre I've seen.",The Grey
10,ma-cortes,Thought-provoking and intelligent film about a survival fight set in Alaska,6,28 February 2012,"This straightforward movie is paced reasonably well and turns out to be a fine vehicle for the main lead , Liam Neeson . In Alaska, an oil drilling group (Joe Anderson , Dermot Mulroney , Frank Grillo , Anozie, Bray , James Badge Dale , Dallas Roberts) fight to survive after a plane crash strands them in the wild . Hunting the humans are a pack of wolves who see them as intruders . They are led by Ottway (Liam Neeson) , a two-fisted and resourceful veteran with suicide tendency .They spend most of it running through the snow, and woods, being wounded , pursued and chased by the pack of wolves.The main and support cast are magnificent when struggle to survive in the hostile environment which the flick is set in. There are still nice scenes to see such as the team leaping from a cliff and several sparkling and thrilling images . It also results to be surprisingly gory along with a handful of violent and breathtaking attack scenes . It's a thunder stuff with a strong star cast though is slowly paced . The hunter leader very well played by Liam Nesson , is a tough man who bears a sad past and attempts to help his partners . The actors supporting are fine , mostly acting as familiar persons or fools of one sort or another . The large secondary cast is completed by Dallas Roberts , Frank Grillo , James Badge Dale and Joe Anderson , among them. Riveting cinematography by Takayanagi , reflecting wonderfully the landscapes in the ultimate unfriendly environment . Suspenseful and appropriate musical score by Marc Streitenfield , as well as emotive . A must see for every enthusiast of a decent action movie with significant and interesting elements . If you are a fan of the main guys Liam Neeson or Dermot Mulroney , you'll want to watch this one.The motion picture produced by Ridley Scott is finely directed and well written by Joe Carnahan (A Team, Smokin' aces , Narc) based on a short story titled ¨Ghost Walker¨ by Ian MacKenzie Jeffers . Rating : Good, it's competent enough, a straightforward entertainment that results to be an intriguing story turned into an OK and broody but depressing film . However , this is definitely an adult-oriented flick because of the violent attacks, gore and some profanity language on hand. Rating : Acceptable movie . Better than average .",The Grey
11,michaelRokeefe,Just to live one more day.,8,13 September 2014,"A plane goes down in the Alaskan wilderness. John Ottway(Liam Neeson)is a sharpshooter that protects oil workers from territorial wolves. Surviving a deadly plane crash, oil riggers must fend for their lives in the ice and snow. Ottway with since of mind, reluctantly assumes leadership of the group. They will scrounge food stuffs and drink from the wreckage as they deal with the thoughts of hopelessness. A GPS signaling device is found and activated, but will it be strong enough and have a enough rage to summon rescuers. There is indeed a nihilistic mood that must take a backseat to finding shelter; but most of all the sense of fear sets in rapidly as the riggers soon come to grips with the fact they are not alone in the snowy wilderness. A pack of carnivorous wolves are ready to attack, protecting their territory. Not totally implausible, the story line is tragic, dark, dramatic and thrilling. If there are any underlying messages to draw, they are deep. Survival is for the fit and smartest.There is some violence, with pervasive language and very disturbing bloody images. THE GREY is rated R. Albeit, the subject matter doesn't distract from the beautiful scenery. Besides Neeson, the cast includes: Dallas Roberts, Joe Anderson, Dermot Mulroney, Frank Grillo and Anne Openshaw.",The Grey
12,sunwarrior13,Our Late Career Action Hero Liam Neeson In Face Of Fear Amidst Survival,10,24 February 2021,"Liam Neeson,who gained prominence as an action hero from the ""Taken"" film franchise stars in this survival thriller in the film directed by Joe Carnahan known as ""The Grey"". Dermot Mulroney co-stars.The film tells the story of John Ottway,who is riding aboard on an airplane for a vacation. Things went in an awry when the plane crashed leaving John together with a few survivors who were mostly oil workers. Then we get to see John lead the team of survivors as they go through the cold weather brought about by snow,the emotions of anxiety and uncertainty, and the fear brought about by wolves.No question that the film is relevant in today's condition of the world especially with a lot of fear and uncertainty that is brought about by the pandemic and the pandemics that are going to come. Also, we get to see how the message of hope amidst life's most difficult situations just like John and his fellow survivors faced.Added to that,the film provides us a great inspiration to embrace life's most fearful situations just like the John the his fellow survivors.It was a great movie. This is far from just a typical serviceable Liam Neeson film.We must understand that life won't always be a bed of roses for there will be extremely tough times and challenges just like what the world is currently facing especially those who are into conspiracy theories of world depopulation and many others. The use of wolves was definitely a great symbol of one that would be able to take away one's life. Finally,the ending definitely kept the audiences hanging whether John survived or not.The ending definitely would have not satisfied many audiences especially those who love happy endings. Too bad that happy endings should not be expected all the time in movies for there will be disappointments and loses in real life. I know that some wanted to see John overcome everything that his fellow survivors didn't. But overall,it is a great way to strengthen the emotions of the audience about embracing fear and the struggles that life provides.",The Grey
13,hitchcockthelegend,"I don't know why this has happened to us. I feel like it's me, bad luck, poison. And I've stopped doing this world any real good.",9,20 October 2012,"The Grey is directed by Joe Carnahan who also co-writes the screenplay with Ian MacKenzie Jeffers, based on Jeffers' short story Ghost Walker. It stars Liam Neeson, Frank Grillo, Dermot Mulroney, Dallas Roberts, Joe Anderson, Nonso Anozie and James Badge Dale. Music is scored by Marc Streitenfeld and cinematography by Masanobu Takayanagi.Seven men led by suicidal John Ottway (Neeson) try to survive in the Alaskan wilderness after their plane crashes. A wilderness of extreme weather and hungry grey wolvesA lot of people didn't get the film they were expecting when they trundled into the theatres to see The Grey. With a shifty advertising campaign suggesting it was an action adventure movie, one where fisticuffs with wolves was a draw card. What resides in Carnahan's movie is however very different from those expectations, for The Grey is a deep movie, a profound movie in fact, one of mythical leanings, strong in philosophical outlooks and spiritualisation, a meditation on grief as well. That it is also an excellent survival thriller is a bonus, so make no bones about it, the film deserved the $50 million profit it made; even if a lot of those original ticket buyers were kind of duped into the theatre admission!Undeniably the film packs a big emotional punch, you have to expect that to some degree, because only the most virginal of film fan wouldn't be expecting deaths in this type of film. But there is a strong affinity to the group dynamic here that really pulls the mature viewer in to the fold. Early on you think it's standard stuff, one of the guys is a macho a-hole, one of them is cowardly etc etc, but with each passage in the story the mood and characterisations change. Introspective analysis comes into play, conversations spin to a higher level, and with Carnahan smartly able to make us feel their isolation, their terror, their conflicts and will to survive; even if that will simply will not suffice, it's very much a picture that gets under your skin and into your brain for all the right reasons.Led by a powerhouse and intense Neeson performance (who better to have on your side in such circumstances?), with Mulroney also excellent, film is perfectly photographed by Takayanagi on location in British Columbia. His photography at times does blend beauty and terror, but mostly it keeps it harsh in colour tones as the cold bites hard and the peril of the journey unfolds. The ending undoubtedly will infuriate many, in the same way as it has proved divisive with those who have already seen it (for the record I love it, think it's perfect, even in conjunction with the ambiguous end of credits mini-coda), while some of the Wolf effects are at times iffy. But all told, this is one of the unsung treasures of 2012, a film of unexpected depth and boasting a myriad of cinematic pleasures. 9/10",The Grey
14,Theo Robertson,Artistic License With Wolves,6,25 November 2012,"This is a film for real men . The opening ten minutes is wall to wall testerone as oil workers in Alska let off a bit of steam by getting blind drunk and breaking chairs over each others heads . If you're a woman skip these scenes because there's so much male hormone on screen that you might just end up pregnant . Halleluha a miracle has happened . If that's not enough we're going to be trated to a plane crash more vivid than the one seen in ALIVE Actually we don't because the film cheats on this score . Instead of bodies flying through the air and massive on screen carnage the movie cuts to Liam Neeson's character Ottway having a dream about his wife then it cuts to Ottway lying on the ground . Why he's several hundred yards away from the plane wreckage or how he survived this crash is never explained , though one can speculate that perhaps the production budget had everything to do with it The crash has obviously left Ottway severely brain damaged because he's lost all common sense . First thing he does is tell a man bleeding to death is that he's going to die and not to let it worry him . Second thing he does is tell everyone to build a fire otherwise they'll freeze to death . The fact that there's massive amounts of unburnt plane fuel splashed around the vicinity doesn't bother anyone . Thirdly on finding out they're surrounded by wolves that will kill them he orders everyone in to a far away forest . Why will this be safer for the survivors ? I think because we wouldn't have a film if they didn'tNo doubt a lot of people problem with THE GREY is the portrayal of wolves and I totally agree . These aren't the wolves you see on National Geographic - these are the type of wolves you see in films with Lon Chaney Jnr . In fact they go beyond even that as Ottway informs both the survivors and the audience that they have a hunting radius of 300 miles and a kill radius of 30 . Hmmmm . So if you trek in to a forest in the distance that will put you out of both their hunting and kill radius ? There's an entire lack of logic to any of this film . Ottway says that they'll never be found because "" they'd [ The rescue authorities ] would need to send 50 planes to find us "" ! Wouldn't the authorities know where the plane had crashed simply by where it disappeared on the radar ? It's even pointed out that someone has a watch with a GPS beacon giving out a signal. We've all read these survival books and they all say stay with the wreckage and trying to trek in the middle of nowhere is the worst thing you can do . Of course Ottway could have stated that if the wolves have access to the dead bodies they wouldn't be interested in potential live prey but hence they've got a motive to leave the crash site this seems beyond the screenwriters thinking One aspect of the film is the humanist element . People who rely on God are going to be disappointed when their prayers go UNanswered and it's up to every individual to make their own way in life without hoping for the intervention of a miracle but the people seen in THE GREY are so idiotic that you can't help thinking any humanism being used is painfully ironic . Of course the other train of thought is that by being so idiotic then it's a classic example of Darwin in action and the wolves deserved their feast. Bon appetit wolfie",The Grey
15,Hey_Sweden,Live and die on this day.,7,14 January 2017,"""The Grey"" is the kind of slick Hollywood product that dares you to suspend your disbelief a fair bit, but it does pay back to a degree. It's a riveting, if imperfect and overlong, survival thriller that falls back on that old cliché that wolves are somehow some of the most evil beasts in the animal kingdom. But it's positively chilling in one sense: you do actually get a feel for the elements, even if the characters aren't always quite dressed up that much. At least co-writer / director Joe Carnahan (adapting Ian Mackenzie Jeffers' short story ""Ghost Walker"") filmed this on some genuine wilderness locations and not some studio backlot.Liam Neeson, as rock-solid as he's ever been, is a man named Ottway, whose job it is to keep the local beasts in line and protect the comrades working on an Alaskan oil rig. One fateful night, their plane crashes, and the handful of survivors are now at the mercy of Mother Nature. They're miles from anything resembling civilization. Their biggest problem? The ferocious wolf pack that goes out of its way to stalk the men and protect their territory.Interestingly, Carnahan doesn't waste much time putting the guys in peril. The plane crash is fairly harrowing stuff. He instead waits for the second half of the movie to give us more character development / details. It's only then that we can really begin to invest in these characters and hope that some of them make it. Carnahan and his talented crew do fashion some believable tension, as well as some potent violence. The wolves are a combination of CGI, animatronics, and real animals.The principally male cast is obliged to play people that may grate on the nerves at first, especially Frank Grillo as the argumentative Diaz, and Joe Anderson as the chatterbox Flannery. But they all do creditable work: Grillo, Dermot Mulroney, Dallas Roberts, Anderson, Nonso Anozie, James Badge Dale. Neeson anchors the tale with his effortless sense of authority and screen presence.Those who stick it out through the end credits will see a VERY brief coda.Seven out of 10.",The Grey
16,zardoz-13,Children of the Night . . . What Music They Make,9,19 February 2012,"""The A-Team"" director Joe Carnahan has made a gritty Man versus Nature saga with Liam Neeson. The premise is simple but effective. A jet transporting oilfield workers from a remote site in Alaska crashes in the middle of nowhere. The survivors struggle to stay alive after a pack of snarling timber wolves come after them. Neeson plays a hunter who keeps the wolves at bay. He is feeling suicidal when he decides to join them on the plane ride home. After the plane crashes, only seven men survive. Ottway (Neeson) tries to save a dying stewardess who is being mauled by a wolf and almost dies himself. The motley collection of survivors set off for the trees to defend themselves from the hungry wolves. Naturally, the group doesn't get along but Ottway manages to hold them together. Nevertheless, the wolves are vicious and repeatedly attack the men. Carnahan pulls no punches, and there are some pretty jolting scenes when wolves strike out of nowhere. ""The Grey"" could easily have degenerated into a predictable mess, but it holds up right until its gripping finale. Several good scenes occur in this off-beat film. At one point, the men manage to kill one wolf. One of the more obnoxious survivors cuts off the beast's head and hurls it into the darkness. Suddenly, the night is filled with wolves howling. All this movie needed was Bela Lugosi uttering the famous line from ""Dracula"" about the wolves howling.",The Grey
17,grantss,Okay,6,13 April 2020,Decent survival / man-vs-wild animal(s) movie. Mostly fairly standard in this regard but the setting is original and the ending is quite powerful.Solid performances all round.,The Grey
18,Boba_Fett1138,Works out way better than you perhaps would think.,7,29 January 2012,"This movie already is one of the biggest surprises of 2012. Seriously, who expected much good from a movie that involved Liam Neeson and a couple of wolves. The movie sounded so unlikely and it was hard to imaging how they could turn it into a good one. But ""The Grey"" as it turns out is a highly entertaining one, that besides managed to be original as well.It basically is a man, or in this case men, versus nature movie, in which a couple of plane crash survivors have to survive in the cold wilderness of Alaska. So the wolves are actually just a part of their problems and the movie involves a whole lot more of dangers. It's what gives the movie a sort of adventurous sense to it, when the characters try to reach safety. Its concept also makes this a really manly movie to watch, which is also not in the least thanks to Liam Neeson, who plays a great lead role and is a real tough guy in this movie. Age doesn't seem to hold him back. This guy is almost 60 now but he's actually being more awesome than ever before in movies.But saying that this movie is a men versus nature movie really isn't covering what this movie is all about. It's a movie with an actual surprising amount of depth and good buildup to it. Director Joe Carnahan is mostly known as an action movie expert but with this movie he really takes his time to set up certain things. It's really a surprisingly well directed movie.The depth mostly come from the movie its character, who basically all are some solid ones. Normally in these type of movies some character's only serve the purpose of ending up getting killed but this movie puts lots of time and effort into making all the character three-dimensional ones, which each their own distinctive personalities.So the depth, the buildup and just its overall approach are quite surprising and certainly unique for a movie of this sort. If you take that all away, you would have had a very average movie, that would had gone straight to DVD, most likely. For the story itself is being quite simple and very straightforward.But another thing the movie obviously has going for it is its high budget (well, for its genre at least). It's really a great looking movie, with also some convincing special effects in it at times and the great settings add to the movie its overall atmosphere and sense of desolation and almost constant danger.This movie is some real good entertainment and it works out way better, more convincing and more original than you could imagine. 7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Grey

When a chartered airplane of oil refinery workers crashes in the middle of a wintry Alaskan no-man's land, it's up to hired sharpshooter Neeson (never better) to forge ahead with the handful of survivors to safety before they're killed by a marauding pack of wolves. While filmmaker Joe Carnahan does a credible job of adapting with Ian Mackenzie Jeffers (based on his short story ""Ghost Walker"") the film feels cribbed from ""DELIVERANCE"", "" ALIVE"" and ""THE EDGE"" with its band of men facing the natural world's terrors awaiting them (and kudos to master F/X & make-up maven Gregory Nicotero for some truly awesome wolves) but wisely anchors the surprising poignancy with his lead actor Neeson (who in flashbacks of his ethereal wife Openshaw keeps his sanity and bearings intact) (emoting deeply perhaps echoing his loss of his wife Natasha Richardson) to do all the heavy lifting literally and metaphorically.",The Grey
20,neil-476,Po-faced action adventure,7,2 February 2012,"Ottway (Liam Neeson), suicidal following his wife departing, is employed by an industrial company in the snowy wilds of somewhere to kill wolves which might otherwise attack workers at a refinery-type site. There is a plane crash in the wilds which is survived by only Ottway and a handful of others: they then have to try to make their way through sub-zero wolf-infested wilderness back to human habitation.This action adventure, though rather glum, is very well staged - the plane crash is convincing, and there is little doubt that Neeson and his fellow thesps are up to their nethers in some cold, cold reality (the wolves are sometimes rather less convincing). There is a fair amount of action which is well presented.On the other hand, a story which I would have quite liked to develop ends up falling into the ""last man standing"" category ie. an exercise in wondering who is going to get bumped off next. To that extent, it is a rather inconsequential piece. Plus the members of the group of survivors aren't terribly well differentiated - I ended up identifying them as Shouty Man, Black Man, Man who looks like Stephen Spielberg etc. And the ending will upset some, though I rather liked it.Overall, then, this is a qualified success.",The Grey
21,Uriah43,Really Captures the Cold Climate,6,7 January 2014,"After their plane crashes in the Artic wilderness, 6 survivors discover that in order to stay alive they must withstand both the extreme weather and man-eating wolves as well. Fortunately, these men have as their leader a person named ""Ottway"" (Liam Neeson) who kills wolves for a living. But the odds are still very long. That said, the director (Joe Carnahan) did an excellent job maintaining the drama and suspense all the way to the very end. I enjoyed the performance of Liam Neeson who clearly seemed to fit the character quite well. Likewise, I also enjoyed the performance of Frank Grillo (as ""Diaz""). Anyway, not wanting to give away any surprises I will just say that this was a pretty good film which really captures the cold climate and the brutal conditions these men had to struggle with. Be advised though that the language is quite colorful in case anybody needs to know. Be that as it may, I rate this film as slightly above average.",The Grey
22,ferguson-6,Once more into the fray,7,28 January 2012,"Greetings again from the darkness. This is certainly not the typical lame, formulaic action picture that we have come to expect most every January. Director Joe Carnahan teamed with Ian MacKenzie Jeffers to write a strong script based on Jeffers' original short story. With a touch of spirituality mixed with an excruciatingly intense story of survival, this film is more of an emotional experience than one might expect based on the trailer.The film opens as Ottway (Liam Neeson) is composing a letter to his beloved wife (Anne Openshaw). At first we aren't sure of their story, only that this was a painful loss for him and he is washing away his sins with an apparent final letter. We later learn more through flashbacks as she is the ""happy place"" into which he retreats in moments of stress ... and there are certainly no shortages of that! We learn that Ottway is a hired sharpshooter to protect the roughnecks on assignment in Alaska. We see him in action as he nails a charging wolf.After the first spiritual interruption at a key moment for Ottway, we next see him and a group of the workers boarding a plane to escape the storm. The plane crashes, killing most onboard and stranding the small group of survivors in a barren, frozen wasteland of Alaskan wilderness. If only that were their biggest problem. Additionally they are being systematically hunted by a pack of ferocious wolves. Ottway's experience and personality lead him to the position of group leader as they look for a way out.There have been many fine survival movies including The Edge (Alec Baldwin, Anthony Hopkins), Deliverance, and The Thing. We even get a wise-crack about the movie Alive, where the plane crash survivors stooped to cannibalism. While I am a fan of all of those movies, none are as full of tension and intensity as this one is, from beginning to end. What really sets this one apart from many is not the action scenes, but the character development. We actually see the character of these men evolve as their plight worsens. Watch for the similarities between man and beast as Diaz (Frank Grillo) challenges Ottway.The other supporting cast members include Dallas Roberts and Dermot Mulroney, but the strength of this movie stems from the script and the casting of Liam Neeson. Supposedly Bradley Cooper was originally cast, and later replaced by Mr. Neeson. It's probably safe to say that my comments would not be as favorable if that change had not occurred. Kudos to director Carnahan who gave us another very intense film called Narc. Since then, he has only delivered shallow works like The A-Team and Smokin' Aces. Here he pays so much attention to detail ... like a wolf paw print in the snow as it slowly fills with blood. Don't be scared away thinking this is just another macho action film. It is much more and, at times, even a very quiet and deep piece of filmmaking ... that will leave you exhausted!",The Grey
23,anaconda-40658,No Bark.,4,15 March 2016,"The Grey (2011): Dir: Joe Carnahan / Cast: Liam Neeson, Frank Grillo, Dermot Mulroney, Dallas Roberts, Joe Anderson: Grey is exactly how I would describe this bleak and depressing thriller. A plane crashes in the Arctic and seven survivors trek away and are picked off thriller formula style by grey wolves, the weather or other wonderful outdoor activities. Some argue that the portrayal of wolves is off target. So is the marketing that hints a big showdown between the film's star and the wolves. It subtracts the typical slasher villain and replaces him with other elements that kill off each individual, and we can easily predict that Liam Neeson will be the last one left. The problem is that the ending is every bit as depressing as the ending of John Carpenter's version of The Thing. Neeson holds his own as a hunter mourning the death of his wife, which is seen in flashbacks. He knows what he is up against but every yuppy idiot who also survived the crash seem to take it upon themselves to know more than he does, which is why he ends up as the last victim. Director Joe Carnahan previously made the superb Narc and the underrated The A-Team and here presents a suspenseful atmosphere of snowy landscapes and snow covered trees that are visually stunning. The problem is he is backed with a screenplay that plays like the worst of slasher films. There have been many thrillers that attempted to capitalize upon one's fear of animals, and many of them are outrageous in their presentation. Here is yet another example of an animal thriller that is in the grey zone. Score: 4 ½ / 10",The Grey
24,AaronCapenBanner,Into The Fray,8,7 January 2015,"Joe Carnahan directed this taut existentialist adventure/drama that stars Liam Neeson(superb) as John Ottway, who works for a big oil company in Alaska shooting wolves and anything else that may threaten the oil rig workers. Ottway is depressed, as he is still grieving for his beloved wife. Things get even worse for him when the company transport plane he is on crashes in the snowy Alaskan wilderness, forcing him and six other survivors in a grueling trek for survival both against the bitter snow and cold, and also a merciless pack of wolves that want them out of their territory, and will go after them one at a time to accomplish this, as Alpha male Ottway must ultimately go head-to-head against the Alpha male wolf.

25,FlashCallahan,did you read that on the wall in the day room?....,8,29 January 2012,"The grey sees Neeson continuing his second coming, like some Hollywood Christ figure. At this point tin his career, the man can do no bad, and with this movie, he continues his run.The man who was going to retire from acting after the haunting plays a man on the verge of suicide, a man with nothing left bu thoughts of his wife, and a rifle to shoot wolves.After a horrific plane crash (one of the best and most frightening I have seen), Neeson and a group of men have to fight for their lives against the forces of nature, the lack of food, and of course, the wolves which are hunting them one by one.This film is not 'alive' (Caranahan points this out by having a couple of the characters mock that film), it's bleak and relentless, and the fact that the narration barely lets them rest, you feel the urgency to it.It's not a horror film, although it can be scary at times, and believe me, it's not for action orientated fans, when someone dies in this, you feel it, you experience it. It's not goodbyes and close your eyes, its drawn out and the camera doesn't give you breathing space.Wheras other films in this genre let the protagonists rest during times of relief, this is different. whenever something happens which causes some humour or lifted spirit, the wolves remind the crew that they are there, watching and waiting.We all know by mow that the wolves are a metaphor for Neeson and the rest of the crews 'demon'. They will never let up and never give you peace until you face your 'demons' (wolves.....I don't think it would have worked with Giraffes).But this is a great movie and a great end to an average movie month, The Grey is haunting and cold, but the script isn't as good as a similar survival movie 'The Edge'.",The Grey
26,phd_travel,Horrible waste of time,1,3 August 2012,I usually enjoy Liam Neeson movies from Taken to the more serious movies. Unfortunately this movie is a total failure in all respects.The story is terrible. The ending leaves you feeling you just wasted your time between gruesome killings and minutes of boredom with the most gruff and uninteresting cast of characters ever assembled. Just one disgusting way to die after another. The fine actors are all unrecognizable and so anonymous in their gruff get ups. Don't feel for any of the characters.They might as well just have stayed put after the crash! Even the wolves are silly and unbelievable.Do yourself a favor and skip this one.,The Grey
27,Wuchakk,Go out fighting (and believing),7,21 October 2014,"Released in January 2012, ""The Grey"" is a somber survival flick filled with primal reflections on death and faith. Liam Neeson stars as the quasi-leader of seven misfit Alaskan oil workers who survive a plane crash in the wilderness. As if this isn't bad enough, a pack of territorial wolves want to take them out. Will they survive? The trailer is misleading in that it advertises ""The Grey"" as an action film, but that's not the case at all. Although there is some action, this is a grave, dreary adventure with raw meditations about the will to live or die and more -- God.It's not as good as 1997's ""The Edge,"" ""Flight of the Phoenix"" or ""Sands of the Kalahari,"" the latter two from 1965, mainly because it's so funereal and seemingly empty, but it's unique and worthwhile.Some complain that the story's unbelievable, like the wolves and the jump from the cliff, but movies (or certain things in them) aren't always meant to be taken literally and aren't supposed to be realistic as filmmakers are more concerned with aesthetics, psychology, metaphors and conveying ideas; and that's the case with ""The Grey."" The survival story is merely a stage.Which brings us to another common complaint, that the film's ultimately pointless, which simply isn't the case. Now you may not like the story or the points that it conveys, but it's not pointless. See my interpretation below, if interested.The film was shot in Smithers, British Columbia, and runs 117 minutes.GRADE: B MY INTERPRETATION (Read only if you've seen the film): Ottway (Neeson) is in a horrible state of grief after the passing of his beloved wife as he protects oil workers by shooting wolves that get too close to the camp. Depressed, he decides to commit suicide but before he can pull the trigger a wolf howling in the distance strangely prevents him. I believe the howling wolf was the Creator's way of speaking to Ottway and giving him a chance to go out fighting; and not just that, go out believing as well, even if it's belief in its rawest form.The next day Ottway finds himself surviving a plane crash in the wilderness with six other men. In contrast to his near-suicide attempt, his survival instincts kick-in and he finds himself doing everything he can to survive, for himself and the others. Do you see the irony? The night before he desperately wanted to die and a mere day later he's doing everything in his power to live and save others.The topic of God and faith comes up at a campfire. A couple of the guys believe, but Diaz naturally mocks such things. Ottway says he doesn't believe either, but wishes he could.Later in the story, Ottway finds himself the sole survivor and at the end of his rope. Cursing, he passionately cries out to the Almighty for succor, but the heavens remain mysteriously silent. Regardless, he musters the strength to (try to) carry on. Shortly later, while reflecting on the men and their loved ones who died, he seems to clasp his hands in prayer and the Alpha wolf appears and challenges him. Unlike a few days ago when he was going to kill himself, he goes out fighting and, even more important, believing.For those who argue that Ottway didn't believe, remember that he was praying when he was crying out to God. Yes, it was a prayer of desperation and rage, but prayer nevertheless. Job did the same thing in the bible. The utterly humbling situation drove Ottway to his Creator and compelled him to go out fighting. It was God's gift. The Almighty knew Ottway better than Ottway knew himself.",The Grey
28,zetes,Surprisingly good,7,3 February 2013,"Surprisingly good survival thriller with some horror film elements. I had kind of suspected it being a similar type of thriller to Liam Neeson's recent hits like Taken. Well, Neeson is certainly a badass in this movie, but it's far more artful than I had imagined. Neeson plays a skilled huntsman who works at a remote Alaskan refinery. On their way back to civilization, their plane crashes and Neeson and a handful of other guys survive it (the harrowing plane crash is equal to the one in Flight). It's a long way to help, and the men are stalked by a pack of almost supernaturally huge wolves. This film might have actually been straight-up great, but there's a long middle section that's bogged down by a cast attrition-type plot line, where each of the non-Neeson characters are individually picked off by the wolves. There's also a particularly annoying Hudson-like character. The film would have been better with either just Neeson (who is fantastic here, probably giving his best performance since Kinsey) or possibly just a couple of other guys. The film has a really great existential feel and it's often beautifully directed. I also loved the score by Marc Streitenfeld.",The Grey
29,trashgang,characterisation and dark view on philosophical way of life,8,13 December 2012,"This is the kind of movies I like. No major production full of macho's and good looking guys and a happy end. This flick comes into your face and is over just before you know it even as it clocks in at almost 2 hours.The story itself is very simple. A plane crashes in Alaska and the survivors, all being oil workers have to lay their trust in a huntsman (Liam Neeson). Soon they notice that they are surrounded by a pack of wolves, the grey. You are immediately into the story. The first minutes you are seeing where they all work and before you know it you are in a plane. There you start to know a few characters just before the plane goes down. the crash itself is well done and with going to a black screen you get the feeling you were there too. This isn't a straight thriller or whatsoever this is a pure survival flick with some nasty and gory moments. Just over an hour when the wolves are supposed to be gone it's a bit too much blah blah but before you know it things are going bad again. From that point we go deeply into characterisation.An excellent flick with perfect performances, be advised, it's not for everybody looking for cheap thrills, it do stick in your mind and is not for the faint-hearted.

30,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The Grey,8,25 February 2012,"Liam Neeson is the go to man these days, especially if it involves a stoic one man army you'd want on your side of the camp to go up against any adversary. Pierre Morel's Taken established Neeson as one man you would not want to cross, and Unknown continues to a lesser degree that he can really break some bones, and with some serious brains to match that level of brawn as well. Having conquered the human species, it's about time someone cast Neeson to tear through the animal world, and Joe Carnahan does just that with The Grey, putting him in Alaska with a bunch of blue-collared workers constantly threatened by wild wolves.Hired by a company to protect its employees out in the Alaskan wild from wolves by shooting to kill using his sniper rifle, Ottway (Liam Neeson) contemplates ending his own life given the loss of his wife (Anne Openshaw), since being alone in the cold and the wild probably played tricks on one's mind given the depressive environment with the lack of warmth, and a rowdy bunch of workers he's bounded to protect. But it's soon his turn to be rotated out together with a plane load of fellow colleagues, if not for an electrical storm to somewhat take the whole plane down, and they crash land into the wild. With a survivor count of seven, they soon discover that being alive and kicking may not necessarily be a good thing, for they are surrounded by a wolf pack all ready to prove who's the boss in the wilderness.Joe Carnahan, responsible for action oriented films like Smokin' Aces and The A-Team, took things down a couple of notches with this effort, with The Grey playing out more like a disaster film, where the survivors must huddle together over their differences in character that provide constant friction, made worst when morale is low, and danger and death looms over the horizon. From the get go the filmmakers captured the effects of death well, and the aftermath of how such effects have on others who survive, especially playing up on the guilt complex. One of the most heartbreaking scenes early on involve having to deal with a dying man - what one would have to do and say, in order to provide for a less painful, fearful departure. Or the rituals that harks back to our baseline humanity of treating the departed with respect, even if there are those who may choose not to in the name of primal survival.As with almost all contemporary Liam Neeson starring films, he plays yet another man with something of a plan, stepping up to lead a bunch of rag tags to make it out alive in the harsh environment that threaten to devour them in a blanket of icy snow. He becomes like a one man McGuyver as noted by a compatriot, who knows just about everything they need to know about their common enemies - the landscape as well as the wolves constantly nipping at their party. It's almost like a battle of wills, rather than an all out actioner, with survivors staring death down in the eyes, and constantly moving and using their wits to get through unpredictable weather conditions, playing it all out like a psychological game instead.Containing many harrowing scenes playing upon incidents that could happen to anyone, with hypotheticals of how would one fare if caught in a similar situation between a rock and a hard place, The Grey accomplished a lot more by showing a lot less, frequently employing cut aways or fade outs to provide deliberate gaps, that would happen in real life as well, such as black outs, or time taken to doze off, before awakening to new realities that demand immediate action even when in a daze. The amazingly haunting musical score by Marc Steitenfeld also provides the film with another mesmerizing dimension that plays on the unknown fate that the party will face, and will keep you at the edge of your seat when accompanying some death-defying moments.What made The Grey stand out is not its action sequences, where episodes have been almost revealed in its trailer to the final detail, but for the more dramatic moments involving the interaction of the survivors and their group dynamics. At times lapsing into caricatures, such as the coward, the stoic supporter, the loud mouthed, and the de-facto leader who has to step up rather reluctantly, lead and make a stand, the narrative dedicates ample time to provide a lot more layers to the characters, allowing you to get chummy with and empathize with their predicament, rooting for everyone to survive their ordeal even as the odds began to stack against their favour, and allowing you to feel a little tingle in your heart for those who would fall.Probably Joe Carnahan's least flashy film to date, being more meditative than a wham-bang action flick from start to end, don't leave the cinema hall just yet when the end credits roll, otherwise you will short change yourself of the film's actual finale. Recommended stuff, and more so if you're a fan of Neeson's recent take on kick-butting characters.",The Grey
31,Mr-Fusion,Rugged and unbelievably tense; much more than I'd expected,8,29 April 2014,"I can't think of anyone else that could've carried ""The Grey"" on his trusty shoulders like Liam Neeson. He is perfect for this movie. He makes the mixture of tortured character and menacing undercurrent look easy. His ever-capable leadership after a plane crash (not to mention his staring down of a pack of preying wolves) is something I can only wish I had. But for all of its white-knuckle terror and intensity (that sound design is a trip), ""The Grey"" is a surprisingly moving affair from an emotional standpoint. It's got a knack for killing someone off just when you've grown attached. Camaderie gets built up and then -boom- they're gone. It's a kickass man vs. nature movie, yes, but I wasn't prepared for the hard-hitting third act. That wallet scene, in particular was an unmitigated punch to the sternum. And the final image of openly defiant Neeson, fists brought to bear and ready to fight, is one that I still can't shake, And not sure I want to.8/10",The Grey

33,StevePulaski,Quickly becomes an unapologetic whiteout,9,28 January 2012,"Many people don't know that wolves do not hunt humans. They don't prey on them, but they look like they could, which is why it's common for films shot in a desolate, snowy area to feature wolves as the main antagonist. Some people, or some that I've seen, seem to get so aggravated at the portrayal of wolves in survival thrillers. For some reason, it doesn't bother them that Freddy Krueger or Jason Voorhees can come back to life over and over again, yet they can't suspend disbelief on one small fact about wolves.As for the film which the wolves occupy, The Grey is a tantalizing, sometimes thrillingly claustrophobic, survival of the fittest horror film. It reminded me more often than not of another film of the same genre; Adam Green's Frozen. That was a very claustrophobic exercise centered around three teenagers that were left abandoned on a ski lift at a closed ski/snowboard resort. Oddly enough, they were also preyed on by wolves, but it was a lot more subtle in quality. The Grey makes the predators pop up frequently so as not to forget that's who we're trying to avoid. The weather isn't the only brutal, unforgiving thing out there.The plot: John Ottway (Neeson) is an Alaskan wolf hunter persistent in his efforts to keep them away from the oil drilling projects that go on in the state. On his way home with the remainder of his crew, Ottoway's plane crashes into the middle of snow and has little time left before hypothermia and starvation set in. Not to mention the wolves.The storyline isn't very deep, but with stories like these it's more about what the characters do and mingle with one another. Every character comes with their own personal baggage and hardships. A rarity in thrillers today. I've always established in horror films and action films, the deeper the characters the more intense sequences are. Would you rather watch a thriller where people are dying left and right and occupy no realism or development, or would you rather see characters, fully fleshed out and developed, be in a tight situation where you can actually sympathize and perhaps relate to them? The Grey knows how to make characters. It also knows how to tack on some enriching cinematography. The snow, from what I believe is real, looks breathtaking. Not only is the snowfall magnificent, but there's one scene in particular, on top of the cliff, that's so realistic and unexpected it may make you flinch. Another side of great, pristine filmmaking.I will also say the plane crash, which I expected to be one dimensional and hokey, wound up being one of the best plane crashes I've seen on film since the original Final Destination. It's so destructive, loud, well designed, and abrupt that it comes off as believable and chilling.Even with a slim storyline, and a mere budget by today's thriller standards, The Grey delivers what it promises and more. If you're optimistic or simply curious stay after the credits for one brief final shot. You may or may not walk out of the theater happier.Starring: Liam Neeson, Frank Grillo, Dermot Mulroney, Dallas Roberts, Joe Anderson, Nonso Anozie, and James Badge Dale.

34,Smells_Like_Cheese,Fate and Destiny,8,11 February 2012,"I saw The Grey opening weekend, with Liam Neeson, how could you ever miss a film with this guy? He's such a good actor and has such a commanding presence and from the trailer I was expecting a B type movie with some cheesy acting and over the top action scenes. Instead I went to philosophy class questioning what death is all about. Almost 15 years ago there was a film called The Edge that was similar to this film only taking more of an action route, it's an enjoyable film and I think that's what I was expecting The Grey to be about. The Grey instead has a little bit more of a deeper meaning, disputing death. Is it horrifying to think about or is it peaceful? It's violent, it's quiet, it's scary but maybe we try to fight it too much. Having to accept the difference between fate and destiny can also be exhausting to think about.John Ottway works in Alaska killing the wolves that threaten an oil drilling team. Upon the completion of the job, the team and Ottway embark on a plane headed for home during a blizzard. The plane cannot withstand the weather and it crashes in the middle of nowhere. Ottway awakens and finds Todd, Talget, Diaz, Hendrick, Burke, and Hernandez. While Ottway is searching for wood, he sees a woman in need of help, but soon finds her being eaten by a gray wolf who also attacks Ottway. He is quickly rescued by the others and explains that they are most likely standing in the wolves' territory and are unwelcome. He later tells them that they must try to get to the trees, which are miles away in a nasty blizzard otherwise they will be picked off by the wolves one by one. Even though they make it, they still have to find help but the wolves are still after them and it's a fight for their lives in the middle of no where.The Grey does a magnificent job in the atmosphere, you really feel cold and isolated with the group. The whole scope of the film with it's images was beautiful and terrifying at the same time, one of those moments where you'd rather be looking at a photo of it, not be stuck in it with little chance of survival. I also adore the hidden meaning where the boys are bragging about how it was amazing they survived the crash and it was destiny to survive, but what is their fate when they realize they're not ""completely out of the woods yet"" sort of speak. It's heartbreaking to see some of them go and accept death. It's also crazy to watch them turn as vicious as some of the wolves they've been avoiding so much. The wolf pact is done so well and the effects are so chilling. The acting is decent enough. My only complaint about the film is the lack of character development, I could feel for Ottway played by Neeson because you understand some of the pain he's enduring while trying to survive. But he pulls out of the pictures of those who have passed and you see they have kids or family members and honestly I didn't care too much because it's a film that is pretty much just about survival. Also I didn't need a million flashbacks to Ottway's wife, I understand it was to show the impact she had in his life, but the letter alone to me showed how much he loved and missed her. The ending, I think will be a hit or miss with some, I was a little disappointed as I feel a little jipped. I went through the story with Ottway I would've loved to see his showdown with the alpha male, even if the scene after the credits indicates that they both went down, I would've loved to see him put up the fight. But I still would recommend this incredible film, it has it's flaws but is very strong and one of the best of 2012 so far. Liam is an actor who never ceases to amaze me and the scene with him screaming to God to show him a sign was heart breaking and one of my favorite in cinema history.8/10",The Grey
35,lasttimeisaw,The Grey,7,14 March 2012,"My very first film of 2012 starts with this snow wilderness wolf-grapple thriller in the local multiplex, which stars the career-rebooting matinée action idol Liam Neeson (who has established a singularly bankable esteem in the genre which used to be Harrison Ford's strong suit after a mega-lucrative TAKEN 2009, and a lesser profit-maker UNKNOWN 2011), whose 2012 is destined to be prolific and my deep condolence for him to overcome his widower phase (though almost 3 years has passed). The film utilizes mostly generic horror stunts to be frightening or mind-blowing in the face of it is an action thriller under an extreme circumstance. A stereotypical alignment of the plane- crash survivors and one-by-one in succession casualty has never been more well-worn as the most primary template. Against all the hindrances above, director Joe Carnahan (from Neeson- billed THE A TEAM 2010) cannily underscores a character study beneath the action exterior, depicts a heart-felt dire strait to excavate the supreme valor of pulling through even for a man who is so distressful in his life and almost commits the suicide if not being stopped by wolves' howl.Another major bonus is the ending, unlike its genre peers, the film unorthodoxly takes its curtain call exactly when we expect a final human vs. wolf showdown, a scheme abruptly counterbalances all the adrenalin drive cached for almost two hours and unanticipatedly generates an authentic gratification. PS: I strongly advise that please remain in your seat after the ending credits (which I ruefully missed).The all-male troupe is well-balanced, with Frank Grillo and Dallas Roberts popping out tellingly in their sidelined roles, the leading man Liam Neeson is once again bears out that age is never an obstruction for him and the knack has been honed to perfection eventually, and his ultimate epiphany and emotional evocation is paving his way for some award recognition in the offing (not likely for this film but please give him some meaty role for Christ's sake!).",The Grey
36,Rainey-Dawn,Survival At It's Best,9,7 May 2021,"A film of survival, isolation and working together. Good character interactions in a cold, lonely setting.

37,KineticSeoul,"""Once more into the fray""",8,11 February 2012,"When I first saw the trailer to this I wasn't expecting a really good movie but this one is engrossing all the way through. The plot is simple with a group of men trying to survive in the cold after few of them lived through a plane crash. The movie might probably be called ""The Grey"" because in some aspects not everything is black and white, and can go both ways in some regards. This is a ambiguous and yet very good men vs. nature movie that brings about emotion despite the simple story. Although the movie goes in a direction where you care for the characters it would have been better if most of the characters grow because of what they are facing. Liam Neeson plays a badass once again, a likable badass and he does a good job with his role. Some lines you wouldn't be able to take it seriously if someone else said it, makes it serious when Liam says it. His character felt like a mix of coldness and warmth, someone you can trust and follow. But what is just as deadly as the environment the characters face are the vicious wolves and while Liam's character Ottway tries to fight back. Unfortunately the movie lacked slightly in the character driven part and felt it could have been more. Personally I liked the ambiguous ending, although after the post credit it gives a bit of a hint. One of the other big star in this movie is how the film was directed and that really adds a lot to this movie. This is a movie worth investing your time into.8.1/10",The Grey
38,sddavis63,"""Primal"" Sums This Up Quite Well",7,24 July 2012,"Liam Neeson (who starred in this movie as Ottway) called this movie ""primal."" I can accept that description. It's primal in the sense that it's basically man (no women) against nature (the elements and wolves). It's an extreme form of male bonding. It's ""Alive"" without the cannibalism and with the wolves. It's not an especially original concept. Man vs nature movies are pretty common. These guys get stuck in the battle because they survive a plane crash in the Alaska tundra; plane crash movies aren't unknown. But, lack of originality aside, this has a strange appeal. The situation seems so hopeless as the wolves stalk them and hunt them down one by one; as they walk and walk endlessly, but at the same time seem to get nowhere. As even Diaz (Frank Grillo) - who made brave comments about surviving on his own when the ordeal started - gave up and resigned himself to his fate. It's a very sombre movie, one with not a great deal of hope. The title ""The Grey"" seems to sum it up - this isn't black and white good vs evil stuff, and that ""greyness"" is maintained right to the very last scene, which reminded me a bit of the last scene in ""The Descent."" It's just what it is. And, in a strange sort of way, there's an element of spirituality to this as well; something that touches and moves the viewer.Liam Neesom was the clear star. Ottway is the guy who takes charge of the survivors, basically because no one else took charge. He tries to lead them out. Neesom was very good in this. The wolves were the other major stars. There's something different about these wolves. They're bigger than they should be (or at least they seem so) - maybe it's just filmed that way to give us a sense of how the survivors must have felt about them. They themselves seemed almost spiritual or supernatural. Primal (there's that word again) - defending their territory because that's what they do. They're frightening, but they're not evil. They're just wolves, doing what wolves do.This is basically a bare bones movie. But it works. I wouldn't call it a masterpiece, but I'd acknowledge it as one that makes an impact with the viewer.

39,Hellmant,Definitely a 'guy film' and it's about as hardcore and ugly as one you're likely to see!,10,1 May 2012,"'THE GREY': Five Stars (Out of Five) Joe Carnahan's epic man vs. nature philosophical adventure film based on the short story 'Ghost Walker' by Ian Mackenzie Jeffers about oil men trying to survive against nature and a pack of grey wolves in Alaska after their plane crashes. The film stars Liam Neeson as it's anti-hero action lead. It was directed and co-written by Carnahan and Mackenzie himself. Carnahan previously teamed with Neeson on 'THE A-TEAM' and he's also responsible for directing the popular crime drama / action films 'SMOKIN ACES' and 'NARC'. He's definitely a proved talent when it comes to bringing big action to the big screen but here he has a chance to show he has some talent when it comes to emotional depth and spiritually as well.In the film Neeson plays John Ottway, the hired gunman of an oil drilling team in Alaska who's job is to kill wolves who threaten the drill site. He's disillusioned by the abandonment of his wife and suicidal. On their way home for vacation the oil workers and Ottway's plane crashes during a violent storm. Threatened by a pack of grey wolves, who's territory they're now in, Ottway takes it upon himself to lead the remaining survivors to safety.The film has been criticized for it's negative and somewhat unrealistic depiction of wolves but they're really just a metaphor for death itself. The movie is about man's struggles to overcome the viciousness that life throws at it (in nature and in social interactions). It's definitely a 'guy film' and is about as hardcore and ugly as one you're likely to see but it's also extremely emotional and beautiful in it's depiction of man's philosophical life struggles. Neeson is excellent and it's Carnahan's best film to date. It should be getting some award attention come awards time but due to the controversy surrounding it's subject matter it sadly, most likely, won't be.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne8a_WCFo3A",The Grey
40,thesar-2,The Grey Men,5,28 January 2012,"Please don't tell me 'The Grey' (5/10 Stars) was a (based-on or inspired-by-a) true story. Because I was tricked once into believing that and trust meif I told you what movie I'm referring to, it would spoil this movie beyond me just telling you the film's decent finale.What I liked here was the lack of CGI. I am one of the few people I know who DESPISES CGI. I want to see someone's heart in a project and from what I've seen and read, these men, including Liam Neeson, spent time in a VERY small and touristy snowbound village in freezing temps and they used real wolves during the shots. I both admire and appreciate that devotion.Since I knew that, I was even more shocked to see these HUGE (and absolutely vicious) beasts on the screen. These weren't as big as the (ah-hem, again CGI) fake-looking wolves in the 'Twilight' films, but damn, they were menacing and dangerous looking. I'd be more frightened of them than freezing to death.Mercifully, even though there were the clichéd characters, including Neeson's Dr. Wolfenstein and the tough ""I'm not afffrrrraaaiddd!"" dude, they quickly moved past those tired formulaic scenes. Sadly, quick wasn't in the movie's pacing. A lot of the scenes went on and on, but none as long as the non-death-death scene of one of the men down-by-the-river.The movie follows seven men through the rough winter wilderness when their plane inadvertently drops into the Wolves Den. Luckily, they have Wolf-Expert Ottway to guide them to civilization before any of them get picked off by either the wolf's bites or simply, frost-bites.Don't get me wrong; I did like the feature. The score was adequate, the cinematography at times was gorgeous and I loved the graininess to the screen – reminded me of a real film and not a digitally made film. Also, if you like that tough-guy Neeson we've grown to love in his signature January releases, you'd like him here. Though, he was a toned down from both 'Taken' and 'Unknown.'It's a See-It, but you'd be better off nice and warm at home when it arrives on BluRay. Probably in a month or two.Side-Note: Wasn't this supposed to be present day? Why did everyoneand I do mean EVERY ONE, had those stereotypical ""Wallet-size"" pictures in their wallets? I haven't done that since I was sixteen (i.e. 1990) and even if I wanted to revisit that tradition, I'd much rather look at HD/Digital ones on my phone. Just saying",The Grey
41,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Cool, impressive horror thriller that does it's job right",9,28 June 2012,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Ottway (Liam Neeson), a man with a dodgy past, haunted by the death of his wife, has taken a job on an oil rig in the middle of Alaska, where his new co workers appear to be mainly men from the lower dregs of society. When they have to take a plane journey to travel over to an area they must work on, it crashes and Ottway emerges as the man to lead the others, who end up locked in a desperate battle for survival...with wolves.The main make or break thing with a horror flick is the location, ideal for establishing the necessary air of tension and unnerving mood, and in the dark, cold, blustery air of snow ravaged Alaska, The Grey has scored it's first direct hit. And thankfully the film starts off with and maintains an impressive atmosphere and sense of style, helped mainly by a successfully blurry, murky camera lens and drowned out background noise. Sometimes, this is more of a hindrance than a help and leaves some scenes looking naff and without their proper dramatic impact and the film does manage to get by on more natural, proper things, such as Neeson's reliably steely lead performance, intensified possibly by the pain of losing his wife in real life.Yes, pretty soon it does start succumbing to genre clichés, from the characters to the scenarios, but the whole thing is done with the correct sense of mood and style and so, just works. It's all pulled off in the right way by director Joe Carnahan, a surprising style employed following his more zany, wild Smokin' Aces and film adaptation of The A Team. Overall, it's a surprisingly effective, well made film that's well worth seeing. ****",The Grey
42,bowmanblue,"Okay film, but not your regular 'action flick'",6,30 May 2014,"The Grey is about a plane full of engineers that crashes and the survivors are stalked by wolves that can make their eyes glow for added menace.It's a pretty simply premise - man vs glowing-eyed beast. There's been a lot of talk on the internet about whether wolves would really behave this way and mercilessly hunt down and kill any humans they find, but, if you're willing to believe that they would, then you can probably go with the story.It's not your regular action/survival film. By that I mean, don't expect wall-to-wall battles and action set-pieces. It's more a group of men walking through snow, then getting picked off one by one.If you're expecting action all the way, you may be disappointed. I found it a little slow. It's around two hours long and, in my opinion, could have been trimmed down by about half an hour. They pad out much of it with shots of Liam Neeson's girlfriend (not on the plane) and how much he misses her.The scenery was nice, i.e. snow. Um, not much more I can say. It was okay - a little disappointing.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",The Grey
43,g-bodyl,Brilliant and Chilling!,9,10 July 2013,"The Grey is a magnificent story about the survival of men out in the barren Alaskan wilderness with imminent danger. My only problem was the marketing of the film. By viewing the trailer, I was expecting an action film. While the film does have action scenes, it's more of a drama with some horror elements. But I'm glad I got this version because it's so good and so powerful. I loved the interaction the cast had with each other and I felt I got to know each character.Joe Carnahan's film is about a group of oil workers who survive a deadly plane crash in Alaska and they all head south but as they do so, the must deal with mother nature and the worst of all.....wolves.Liam Neeson is now an action star and at his ripe old age of sixty, he shows some gut in the movie. He's not killing people(or wolves) Taken-style, but he shows himself as a good actor in the drama category. I liked the other actors especially Frank Grillo as Cruz. He was one cocky guy but I felt sympathy towards the guy.Overall, this is a great, powerful film that has one of the best endings I have seen in awhile. The wolves may look unrealistic and seem monster-like, but that's not a big deal. This is a character study and an important one. It's sad how poor marketing has people not liking this film.

46,secondtake,Intensely masculine survival film that strains to be more than that,6,28 September 2012,"The Grey (2011)At first, after the plane crash, it seems that it's the cold that's going to win. It's really cold, and it seems there are no trees in sight, nothing but snow. But then the wolves move in and the name of the movie makes sense (it's not called ""White""). If you expect a battle between five or so men and a large pack of wolves to be at all elevated or if there is meant to be a holy understanding between species, think again. This isn't ""Dances with Wolves."" This is meant to be the closest thing to the real deal as possible. The coughing, limping, crying, shouting men who were once so utterly fit and tough is as real as you might expect. And their rising up with truly masculine strength against the elements and the wolves is sometimes impressive.This is quite the manly man movie that has a weird amount of controversy around it, some of it seeming to be a little forced (maybe to increase ticket and DVD sales). Even the wikipedia entry seems loaded, as if people have it out for the movie. And at the bottom of it all is the fact that this is a simple survival film, and when you're in the Alaskan freezer box with wolves all around you, survival gets ugly.And sometimes a little redundant. I mean, the cold, the hunger, the fear, the rivalry between them men, and yes the so-called philosophizing are all intense and important. Over a two hour period, even as you're hanging in there through the violence, you want something more. It could be another layer to the plot, though I don't know what (these few tough oilmen are extremely isolated). Or it could have elements of psychology and, maybe (maybe) philosophy that take us further down some path beyond the practical aspects of survival.It makes sense that these men find their working-class language to face death and whatever follows death. The simple idea shared by at least two of them that there is no afterlife is fair enough, and they are realistic enough to consider the possibility that this is all we have, here and now. And it doesn't mean the viewer has to agree. To call this a movie with ""atheistic themes"" is delusional. If you want to face a death without an afterlife in a truly harrowing and amazing movie, see ""Wit,"" which is as far from this one as possible.As for the animal cruelty, I think the only way around that would be to shoot a different movie. I mean, you might ask whether we need a movie about men fighting wolves for survival. But then, why not? It's not up to us--except in choosing to see it or not.And I saw this. Liam Neeson is I think a perfect leading man, older, still tough as nails and a smart, hardened adversary to the crushing challenges around. The remaining cast is kind of the expected range of men. Their interactions are solid but veer into clichéd personality conflicts and clichéd intimacies. The problem really is, over and over, that the core of this movie is all there is. It's about the adventure of pushing to your limits. And picturing yourself in their shoes. In fact it's so well made, with stunningly clear photography, you practically cringe and shiver and groan with them. The characters (and the actors, it would seem) are more physically challenged than made to be resourceful. In a way, it reminded me of ""Touching the Void"" where a pair of mountain climbers likewise had to find their physical limits to survive.See this? I'm not sure. You'll know if you like this kind of film and all the shaking camera and blood and suffering. I know I wanted more of something else.",The Grey

49,westsideschl,Short Story Not Short Enough,2,10 June 2012,"Movie is based on a short story which doomed it from the start because we know how much research and effort goes into a short story. A good story takes years to write and rewrite and involves a lot of research. Not in this case. Too many holes not well thought out for a reality based story. I, like many others, bought the movie because of Liam and his face is prominent on the cover. Should have been a wolf - at least you would get to see one. Problems: (1.) The initial scenes of a a bunch of guys drinking and brawling seemed too much like Hollywood script writers copying an old western saloon. (2.) Liam's suicide thoughts were just a distraction and out of place. (3.) The plane crash sequence, which was imaginatively created from the passengers pov turned out to be just cheap filming as all we're shown is a subsequent scene of a partial plane and stuff strewn on snow. And the usual couple of burning fires. (4.) The drunken cowboy stereotypes as survivors continue which under the circumstances didn't seem to fit workers accustomed to working in those difficult conditions. (5.) Usual dumb decisions like not fashioning snow shoes (easy to do from plastic suitcases and webbing; not making weapons from aluminum as defense against predators; not making torches; not gathering more than one lighter; not punching more holes in fuel tanks for kerosene; not using powder from bullets for small explosives; not making aluminum trekking poles. Basically not good planning while not searching for survival materials. (6.) The shotgun shells on sticks seemed to have gotten lost - not that it was explained that well in the first place. (7.) Final scenes of not fashioning a crutch or carrier for the leg injured survivor; being submerged in freezing water and when Liam gets out he's not shivering or hypothermic. Should have been dead, if not while in the water, then soon afterwards. (8.) Not trying to find a path down a small cliff - the wolves seemed to have had no problems. (9.) The behavior and pursuit by the wolves was way over the top - thought I was watching ""Twilight"". Their brief momentary cameos in scenes and even the artificially reflective eyes was just cheap cinematography. (9.) River they were following was large to begin with but got progressively smaller.

50,ironhorse_iv,Who is afraid of the big bad wolf? The Grey might be a little too grey.,7,2 June 2014,"I'm howling at the moon about the grey! It was alright. Directed by Joe Carnahan, and based on the short story ""Ghost Walker"" by Ian MacKenzie Jeffers, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Carnahan. The movie focus on a group of Alaskan oil workers who survived a plane crash on their way to Anchorage, Alaska. Only to find themselves in the wilderness, forced to fend off attacks by dangerous man-eating wolves on their way to civilization. The action scenes were entertaining. The way, they portray the plane crash scenes are just nightmarish. Probably the scariest thing in the movie. The acting was alright, but it hard to like any of the characters due to their unlikeable, horrible dialogue or lack of development. Cluster f-bombs doesn't help, make it any better. The main character, John Ottey (Liam Neeson) was fine. I love the way, he makes improvised weapon, out of normal stuff, but his wolf-hunting skills are just not there. It's weird that a nearly 60 year old man like Neeson, can still play the gritty action hero. One thing that bother me a little are the grey wolves, itself. The grey wolves were not realistic at all. I really didn't like how the movie had CGI-enhanced wolves, because they didn't look right or act real. It looks like they were getting chase by werewolves. If only they use more real gray wolves. I would believe these wolves as a threat, more. The Wolves looks and act like supernatural beings doing more than what normal wolves could do. I do think the night scenes darkness makes it scarier, but you can't see anything. It's way too dark. I do understand artistic license, and it's supposed to represent a killer machine freak of nature like the shark in 1975's Jaws or the lion in 1996's Ghost in the Darkness. What made those films, great is how little, you see the monsters. I also do understand the Environment/ Native American metaphor message. In which the wolves look and act like demons from hell to punish the men for drilling their land, and killing members of their society. Surprising, there is a religious message that kinda got lost in the film with characters in the film, being atheists. I don't know, if the movie theme is living in the face of presumed hopelessness or what, but honestly, I don't think all atheists are suicidal. If the whole time, they were in purgatory, I guess it kinda makes sense. While, it's really good - an existentialist parable - in wolves clothing, it's distracting. The movie's deeper meaning between black & white kinda makes this movie less of a realistic survival movie, and more like a horror movie. The movie gave the wolves a reason for their odd behavior for hunting the humans. They are suppose justified in their attack because they felt threaten by the human presence in their own wolf pack's personal territory and they never encountered humans before. The film got some backlash due to the negative portrayal of wolves. It got worst, when animal activists found out that the movie indeed buy four wolf carcasses from a local trapper, two for props for the film and two wolves for the cast to eat for certain scenes. This really angered environmentalists and animal activists, who were already irate that the film depicts wolves in a negative light, specifically at a time when grey wolves had recently been removed from the Endangered Species Act. Some animal rights groups boycotted the film like PETA. Another fault of the film is the theme. Without spoiling it, for a movie about surviving, it's just doesn't work. It's so depressing. I don't get it, why make a survival thriller, only to waste people time with an awful Wolves Den type ending AKA 1969's Butch Cassidy & Sunshine Kid, Bolivian Army type ending. It makes the whole movie pointless. I guess a happy ending would have cheapened this film, but I think most people wants to see a movie where the hero survived. Yes, it's predictable, but people go see a movie looking for hope, not a downer message. Its reasons like that, that make movies like 2012's Life of Pi and 1993's Alive, far superior movies than this. Don't get me wrong, I can handle, downer Man Vs Nature endings such as 2007's Into the Wild and 2000's Perfect Storm. The only differs between those movie and this, is that this is movie plays out more like a cheesy horror movie fiction with mostly unlikeable characters than a realistic portrayal of survival. It's a man vs nature with nothing in stake. The movie could had done with less narration as, there are things, we could figure out with the silence reflection. The ending also was a bummer, because in the trailer, the movie makes it seem like we would see a huge fight between John Ottey and the Alpha wolf. It was sadly cut or not film. There is a post-credit scene, but it's really doesn't help solve anything. It was indeed bad misleading advertisement.

Not only that they also see John & Co. as being a threat to their existence in being so close to the den that they make or call, in wolf talk, their home!***SPOILERS*** The wolves lead by a ferociously looking jet black, with blazing yellow eyes, alpha wolf start to systematically attack the men lead by John and end up killing and devouring most of them.

With all the men he's responsible for now long dead or eaten by the wolf pack a ""I have nothing at all to live for"" John Ottway feels win or lose this is going to be the end of the line for him anyway.",The Grey
54,Tweetienator,A Painting in Black,8,21 August 2018,"To me The Grey is not so much a movie on survival or something like a survival-actioner but a psychogram of an already broken man, who, challenged once again by bad luck, finds and gathers his strength for one last and great fight - a parable of the eternal struggle between the human being and a sometimes cruel and unforgiving fate and its (dark) beauty.Great performance by Liam Neeson - all in all a very good movie - if you don't expect a ""realistic"" story/movie about survival in the wild.",The Grey
55,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Neeson and Carnahan go above and beyond the survival thriller norms,9,27 January 2012,"Liam Neeson the gritty action hero. How unbelievable that at nearly 60 years old, an actor can redefine his career and become more bankable. Neeson has somehow re-channeled the seriousness he brought to dramatic roles into creating utterly convincing heroes in decent (at best) thrillers. But that's not ""The Grey."" ""The Grey"" earns marks far above decent, and Neeson's performance makes it better. I know, the calendar clearly reads January, but that's a matter of maximizing box-office potential in this case. Writer/director Joe Carnahan (""The A-Team"") has turned a new leaf in this harrowing wilderness survival thriller, a film as dedicated to exploring the true extent of the human will to live as much as shocking its audience with menacing wolf attacks.Neeson leads the pack in all manner of ways. Paid to protect oil workers from nature's dangers (especially wolves), Neeson's character Ottway turns out to be a group of drillers' best chance for survival when their plane crashes in the Alaskan wilderness near a wolf den. He's far from a boy scout, however, and he's emotionally wounded by the past as evidenced by visions of his wife.Most of the early indicators in the film give you the sense that Neeson will do his usual solemn-faced hero routine that he executes to perfection, but the way the film unfolds (not in terms of plot, but in terms of the quality of the storytelling) asks him to go beyond that. He definitely responds.When looked at in its most fundamental form, ""The Grey"" could be considered just another film in which a group of imperiled people die one at a time en route to finding safety. Carnahan, however, slows down that pace so that we can absorb the extent of the danger and imagine ourselves in it. When death does occur, it's visually striking, jaw-dropping and/or thought-provoking as compared to standard efforts at the genre that involve only jump-scare deaths or death by character stupidity. Only one character, Diaz (Frank Grillo) gets a stereotype as the stubborn self-centered jerk who disagrees with Ottway on purpose. Most movies would've killed him off before he got too annoying, but Carnahan and co-writer Ian Mackenzie Jeffers (who wrote the short story the film's based on), have more interesting plans in store for him. It's also not just a film about people being hunted by wolves in the wilderness. There's no bloody man vs. wolf climactic battle, unlike what the trailers would have you believe, so film fans prone to take misleading marketing out on the film itself, be prepared. ""The Grey"" is much more of a suspenseful drama with high-adrenaline scenes lurking around every corner. As such, the visual style of ""The Grey"" asks for something different from Carnahan than the over-the-top high-flying nature of his previous two films, ""The A-Team"" and ""Smokin' Aces."" The overall tone is gritty and naturalistic, so snow-caked beards without the blistering frostbite makeup. The action is also more frenetic and gripping. Rather than shooting the action scenes in a traditional sense, he wants the viewer to feel as if they are experiencing them along with the characters. If a character falls from a tree top and hits 20 branches on the way down, that's exactly what the camera's doing. This maximizes the intensity of every major sequence. As for the wolves, they're horrifying, yet never painted as the bad guys. They're just part of nature.When it comes to issues of faith and the will to survive, that's when ""The Grey"" really jumps up and above the bar for its genre. The story is told in such a way that when people die, it's not for our entertainment, but to highlight the unpredictable nature of ... nature, and life and death. As Ottway wrestles with these same issues, its Neeson's performance that makes it hit home.""The Grey"" gives its audience the rare gift of genre-film entertainment with some serious food for thought and an ample dose of emotion. Carnahan's choices on how to tell the story, along with an ending not typical of genre films, only make it all the stronger. Both he and Neeson display the true nature of their strengths. Hopefully we've seen only the beginning of Carnahan's potential, and that nature is kind enough to Neeson to let him continue challenging the norm for the standard heroic performance.~Steven CThanks for reading!

56,Vartiainen,"Intense, powerful and memorable",5,16 March 2012,"It's rare to find a thriller that really manages to hold a guy at the edge of his seat. This movie did just that. People were screaming and jumping from their seats in the theater, and while I personally didn't go quite that far, I must admit that I was seriously rattled by this film. Whenever one of the wolves made an appearance, it was a powerful, gut-wrenchingly unnerving scene that left your heart pumping like crazy. A movie where jump scares really served their purpose and fit into the story.But the movie was more than that. It was also a really good story about the fragility of men and the world that they thought they ruled. All of the main actors were extremely good in their roles and the characters themselves were surprisingly well-rounded for this type of a movie. They had real conversations with each other, their different personalities were established early on and I grew rather fond of them, I must admit. Plus, this might very well be the strongest role from Liam Neeson that I've seen so far. The man was pure magic throughout the entire film. A role that really fit him.About the only things holding this movie back are the flashbacks into Ottway's (Liam Neeson) past and the limitations of the story. The flashbacks were not that bad and they served to make Ottway's fate a bit more tragic, but they also felt a bit weird when in contrast to the rest of the film. The mood was broken whenever one them started. And the story itself, well, it's a survival tale. Those are not bad, but they're rarely anything that we haven't seen before. This movie works because of its mood and atmosphere, not because of its characters or story. Neither of the latter are bad, but they're nothing new either. A very good movie, and definitely worth a watch, but a masterpiece it ain't.",The Grey

He realizes he's not the only survivor, but 6 others and they unite heading into the snowy wilderness where they become hunted by a pack of hungry wolves.

He shoots one of these magnificent animals with seeming regret as he kneels next to its body. After writing to his departed wife, he later puts the rifle barrel in his mouth but removes it when hears a howling wolf in the distance. The great white hunter then is flying over Alaska when the plane crashes into the frozen tundra. He and six other survivors build a fire to avoid freezing to death. They soon have unwelcome visitors in the form of wolves who seem intent on making their stay as unpleasant as possible.Neeson is a larger than life on screen presence, as always, and the supporting cast is competent, but the problem is the script which is filled with clichés and is, at times, overly sentimental. In addition, the action scenes are unrealistic and beyond the realm of possibility.British Columbia is beautiful as the location used for Alaska the setting is breath taking.

Set in the Alaskan wilderness, Ottway and a dozen men survive a harrowing plane crash and somehow must make it back to civilization. It's bad enough they are injured, hungry and freezing to death, but they soon discover that they are being pursued by a pack of mountain wolves. Strengthened by the fact that he has someone waiting for him back home, Ottway allows his wife's image to drive him ever forward. The men who survived with him have little choice but to follow, each believing that do otherwise is certain death. The film is shot in a snowy landscape with blizzard-like conditions and for the most part changes little. The growls and snarls of the black and silver wolves create a savage din and reminder of the instant death which awaits any who lags behind. Neeson given a stellar performance and a solid reason why an audience will find this film, like so many others, a worthwhile investment in time and attention. Recommended. ****",The Grey
60,DarkVulcan29,well made story of survival,9,30 January 2012,"This story is no clichéd action film, it's a gritter real story about surviving in dangerous territory. This film will you on edge, and make you jump.The story is about a bunch of oil drillers who are flying home, but because of the terrible snow storm, get into a serious plane crash, the band of survivors try to make it out during a heavy snow storm in hopes to find help, in hopes to be rescued, and not be eaten by a pack of hungry wolves will they make it out alive? I really enjoyed this film, sometimes it's hard to watch, but still a real film about survival of the fittest. Liam Neeson was excellent here, you really into his characters head, but although it is clear he's the star, but he never hogs the attention for himself, he lets all the characters shine also. The wolves are pretty scary also, but it shows us how wolves are in the Alaskan wilderness. If you want a surprise please stay after the end credits.",The Grey
61,dfranzen70,"Neeson bright, bitter light",7,16 September 2012,"Liam Neeson, perhaps the most underrated actor of them all, stars as a wolf hunter/expert who must lead a band of survivors through the Alaskan wilderness after their plane crashes. Neeson is effective as always, the setting is both beautiful and terrifying, and the wolves themselves will turn any heart colder than their home tundra.The men must face four enemies: the wolves, who are smarter than the average bear; the harsh environment; each other; and, of course, their own fears and mortality. Shortly after the plane crashes, it's clear that only Neeson's Ottway has any real leadership abilities. Most of the passengers and crew are dead. The fuselage is torn in two, and pieces of the plane are scattered. Wolves are closing in. Director Joe Carnahan does a serviceable job of moving things along without letting things like backstory get in the way. It's not important who these men have left behind or what they have to live for. It's only important that they survive. And although you get the requisite man-who- doesn't-want-Ottway-to-lead and the man-who's-sort-of-a-nebbish, Carnahan makes it clear that this is Neeson's show. We're permitted to know just enough about each character to empathize with them without getting distracted from the engine driving the plot - their actual survival.You couldn't ask for a better action lead. Neeson has this quality of being able to Lead no matter what the role is without seeming to be just an Action Star. It's tougher than it looks. Harrison Ford is basically an action guy; so is Tom Cruise. They do other stuff, but when you see them in a movie you think of action roles they've had. Not so with Neeson, a wonderfully adaptable actor. Here, he is tough, hard nosed, but in pain. So much pain that he almost doesn't get onto the plane in the first place, if you catch my drift. Hey, living in Alaska for a long period of time would drive me a little crazy, too.The men can't stay near the wreckage, as apparently they've stumbled into the territory of a den of wolves. So trek on they do, in thigh-high snow drifts and with little to protect them. They're roughnecks themselves, more or less, but with a blinding blizzard before them and carnivorous creatures bent on their destruction besetting them on all sides, the odds are not at all in their favor.You have to admit that some of the shots are really astounding. At one point there's a gorge that must be crossed. You or I might think it wiser to walk farther down the edge of the gorge to find a safe place to cross. Not Ottway and crew. They fashion a makeshift rope and shimmy over. Nothing to it. It's either that or the wolves, really, and having already seen the alpha and his crew up close, it's an easy decision for them to make.You know, I liked this movie. I admire tough characters and tough performances, and there's enough action packed into the movie to satisfy the casual fan. The crash itself is brief - not like, say, Alive - and there's no hint of cannibalism. It's more of a fight against expected elements, such as wolves and bitter, blinding cold. I liked the treatment of death, how for some it was a happy embrace as each was escorted by a loved one to somewhere or other. And Neeson really is terrific. There are some movies in which he looks and acts tough, and then he'll have a tender scene or two to sort of temper things a little. Here he's gutsy, steely, and conflicted. The final scene is perfect.",The Grey
62,PWNYCNY,Who are the real victims?,10,3 February 2012,"If you are a wolf, you probably will not appreciate this movie. Man's best friend is his dog; man's worst enemy is the dog's first cousin, the wolf, that is, if you are stuck in the middle of wolf country. This movie strongly suggests that wolves, and maybe all animals in general, have a sense ownership. Now, whether wolves actually have such thoughts can be argued, but if they don't then this movie must be placed in the horror-film genre, but if they do, then this movie is a great drama, for both wolves and humans. After all, what would YOU do if someone trespassed on your territory? Wouldn't you feel somewhat irritated or even threatened? In this movie, the wolves move about in military-like precision and manage not only to out-brutalize but outwit their hapless human intruders. One can feel empathy for the humans, who, after all, did not ask to be placed smack in the middle of wolf country, but one can also understand the wolves' point of view too. Why should the wolves be demonized then? They live away from humans, inhabiting some of the most inhospitable territory on the planet, yet they are still beset by humans, even in their remote corner of the planet, and not just by any humans, but by some of the less-classy elements of humanity, including a man who is a professional wolf-killer AND is suicidal too. Well, here the tables are turned, and the wolves are now in charge. What happens next is what this movie is about.",The Grey
63,drqshadow-reviews,"A Dark, Deep, Introspective Dose of Suspense",8,13 August 2012,"A harsh, bitter, introspective survival picture that wasn't at all what I expected from the trailers. What the film chooses to do, it does very well - the suspense is so thick that my neck muscles remained in a stiff vice grip for hours, and the constant landscape shots are awe-inspiring - but those wildly successful qualities come at the expense of others. It's not a story with a firm resolution, which is sure to polarize a lot of viewers, and most of its intentions are left ambiguous. Liam Neeson is his typical commanding, badass self, but despite a few action hero moments he makes some boneheaded mistakes and his leadership qualities leave a lot to be desired. I've read that the plot is a metaphor for existentialism, which makes plenty of sense in reflection, but in the heat of the moment it feels desolate and hopeless. That innate duality makes it a complicated picture to rate; I wasn't oblivious to its faults, but still found it a dense, intriguing and enveloping experience. Worth watching, even if you wind up hating it.",The Grey
64,estebangonzalez10,Liam Neeson Against the Wolves,7,7 March 2012,"¨Once more into the fray. Into the last good fight I'll ever know. Live and die on this day. Live and die on this day. ¨ Joe Carnahan directed Liam Neeson in 2010 when they worked together in The A-Team, and now they decided to reunite once again in wildlife survivalist movie, The Grey. This is a very different film from the action comedy they made in The A-Team. The Grey is a much darker film that deals with surviving the dangers of the wilderness (in this case surviving a pack of wolves in the winter of Alaska). The film has several flaws and you can find a lot of plot holes in the story's logic, but I can't ignore the fact that this movie was entertaining and thrilling. It had me at edge of my seat during several parts of the movie, although I did have some issues with the pacing of the film. There were several unnecessary scenes and dialogues I wished would've been cut off. What I did enjoy the most about The Grey is Liam Neeson. He is a true action star and he has proved himself in every film he stars in. You can just put him up against anybody or anything and you can have a decent movie. He is just that good. Ever since Taken, I was blown away with him. If I survived a plane crash and had to fight off a pack of dangerous wolves then I would definitely choose Liam Neeson as my companion. He is a true star and a bankable actor which is hard to find nowadays. Without a very great script, Neeson does the best and gives us an enjoyable movie. There aren't a lot of good movies that tend to be released in January or February, and this is definitely above average so by all means see this unless you still have a lot of catching up to do with the late 2011 films.The story focuses on Ottway (Liam Neeson) a hunter who is working for an oil company in the wilderness of Alaska. He isn't proud of his life or his job. The film begins with a narration of a letter he is writing for his ex wife saying how much he misses her and how he wished he could be with her although it's not possible any more. He then gets on a plane and while they are flying over Alaska with several other oil workers, the plane crashes. Only seven people survive the crash, and Ottway is among them. The other survivors are Hendrick (Dallas Roberts), Díaz (Frank Grillo), Talget (Dermot Mulroney), Burke (Nonso Anozie), Hernandez (Ben Bray) and Flannery (Joe Anderson). The seven are shaken up by the crash, but Ottway begins showing his leadership qualities by trying to find a way to survive the harsh weather. They soon find out that they aren't alone when a pack of dangerous wolves who are protecting their territory attack them. The men try to stay together in order to survive the threat. Ottway tells them that they shouldn't stay put because the wolves will surround them so they begin heading towards the woods. The wolves and the cold weather will put these men's surviving skills to the test in the middle of the wilderness.The screenplay was written by director Joe Carnahan along with Ian Mackenzie Jeffers who actually wrote the short story that this film was based on: Ghost Walker. I don't know if I would've been interested in the story if it weren't for Liam Neeson who made this a much better film than it really would be. He just makes this film so much suspenseful and better. I thought he was just great in the ending, and he just looked so cool and in control the entire time. We may not be able to control the things that happen to us, but we can choose how to face them, and Liam Neeson just does the best he can with the card that are dealt his way. The rest of the characters I could actually care less for. It was actually hard to distinguish who was who at times with all the heavy clothes they were wearing. I also had some trouble figuring out what they were saying at times. The scenery was beautiful, you could actually feel the cold weather penetrating, and the action scenes were OK although they pretty much left everything to your imagination as they cut several things out. The only thing I'm sure of after watching The Grey is that Liam Neeson can make almost any film work if you just let him take control of the film. This is what The Grey does best, it focuses entirely on him and lets him single handedly carry the film. The problem I has with his previous film, Unknown, is that they didn't let him be in control of everything that was happening. He seemed kind of lost in that film, but here he is just secure and ready to act like in Taken. I really enjoyed this film.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",The Grey

Revolving around a group of rugged oil rig workers who fight for their lives in the Alaskan wilderness after their plane crashes miles from civilization and a pack of hungry wolves close in for the kill.I'll admit this freaked me out with all the howling wolves in the dark, stalking and picking the men off one by one. Bleak landscape too, the wind, the cold the dark. The pack behaviour of the wolves is well done and they haven't been all CGI'd into some huge monsters either. I could have done without all the man bickering and chest beating from the survivors after the plane crash, although I'd expected that dynamic. Lots of recognizable sub actors there.Liam Neeson does a decent job as the skilled outdoorsman leader dude, flexing his acting chops towards the end, where it becomes a different sort of movie, introspective and less slasher.

69,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"Phenomenal, emotional, deeply affecting film",10,19 March 2015,"The Grey is a fantastic, absorbing film from Joe Carnahan, who did the gritty, intense narc and the balls out brilliant Smokin Aces.Liam Neeson stars as a grizzled, tormented big game Hunter, hired by a petroleum company to kill off dangerous wildlife in the areas where their drillers are working. When the transport plane carrying a handful of these workers crashes into the remote Alaskan wild, the few survivors are faced with survival against the harsh elements and terrain, as well as a monstrous pack of territorial wolves out to get them.The film abandons Hollywood fireworks and mind numbing action for an intelligent, emotional and very well written and acted tale. Each of the characters is treated with the care and love it takes to make you feel for them, until they are each a human being, and not a commodity to be slaughtered by the wolves for our entertainment. Neeson is staggering as Ottway, a broken man with a flint spark still left in him, a man whose lost everything raging against the dying of the light simply because that's all their is left to do. His character arc is one of startling pathos, grinding, old school bad assert, and heart wrenching tragedy, leading up to a final ten minutes that are the best of the film, and the most affecting conclusion to any film I've seen in a while. This is heavy, sad stuff and I found myself brought right to tears on more than one occasion during the film. Dermot Mulroney is outstanding, playing his role with a restraint and 'average Joe' humanity that immediately makes him relatable. His story too is a sad one, but well handled by Mulroney, a very underrated actor who really shines with this role/script. Frank Grillo is smouldering as Diaz, the obligatory cocky asshole that films like this make a staple of, but rarely give as much respect or reverence as an actual person, and not just a cinematic archetype, as Carnahan and Co. give Grillo/Diaz. Nono Anonzie, Joe Anderson, Dallas Roberts, Ben Fray and others all give vivid, fleshed out performances as well, making you feel that you are watching real humans in shock and pain dealing with something like this, not characters in a movie going through the motions. The lush, gorgeous cinematography is a wonder to behold, the direction is swift yet lingering, ruthless yet tender, and all the while Carnahan is remarkably assured in where's he's steering the story, he is truly a talent to behold. The Grey is a rarity, a wilderness survival adventure that ducks the glitzy clichés of these type of genre films and goes for something more intimate, more deep, and is all the better for it.",The Grey
70,kluseba,Intense and perfect in every little single aspect,10,7 February 2012,"It has been quite a while ago since I have witnessed such a great movie in the cinemas. This is easily the best American movie since Martin Scorsese's ""Shutter Island"". ""The Grey"" has so many memorable and touching scenes, an incredible and authentic acting, many breathtaking landscapes perfectly captured by stunning camera works, a couple of decent special effects and a very intense atmosphere.The story kicks off very simple. A suicidal wolf killer dramatically crashes down with an air plane in the middle of Alaska's no man's land and tries to save the few survivors and himself from the cold, the isolation and a pack of hungry wolves.What follows is a strong play of the actors that all develop a lot in this movie. They all have their reasons to carry on and try to survive: they want to see their daughter again, have sex for one last time with a beautiful woman or fight the demons of their blurry past. The most intriguing story turns around the main character. I don't want to reveal too much but I had a very precise idea what this guy was fighting for but when I got the solution in the end, I was completely bumped and my eyes were filled with tears which doesn't happen that often.The movie works a lot with emotions and contrasts. The criminal rebel becomes a more human person that talks about his desires, his fears and his mistakes. The tough and lonesome hunter becomes a very human saviour. The cool and relaxed guy has to face the bitter seriousness of life. Extreme changes change people and this movie dresses a perfect psychological portrait of each character. The scenes are sometimes very gore. A man wants to go to the toilet in a moment of tranquillity just to get brutally killed. In one moment, a man has a beautiful vision of humanity, peace and warmth just to get torn into pieces by a pack of wolves in the next moment. Another scene shows a man who is ready to die in peace in front of a beautiful panorama just before two grey shapes interrupt the harmony in a bloody way. These scenes will surely touch you and these are just three examples out of many stunning moments.I also need to point out the dialogues in this movie. They are so philosophic and even poetic at some points but also filled with a brutal realism that sends shivers down my spine. There are many flashbacks filled with doom nostalgia that abruptly switch to a very dark here and now. But in this grey atmosphere, there is also a message of faith, hope and will in this beautiful movie.I'd also like to add that I really liked the unusual ending of the movie that perfectly fits to the rest of the film and crowned this amazing flick for me even if fans of commercial Hollywood mainstream movies might actually dislike it.I give you two advices for this movie. Watch it while it's still in the cinemas because of the great sound and visual effects and the very intense atmosphere. Don't forget to wait until the very end of the movie as there is a small scene of a few seconds after the credits that is not that important but nevertheless worth to be seen.In the end, this is a very intense movie without any weak points that I will surely purchase in the future and watch over and over again with my friends. This is the first big movie highlight of the year and blew me away. It easily hits the top twenty of my favourite movies of all times and I might add that I have seen quite a whole lot of flicks as you can see when you read my other reviews. Be sure to not miss this outstanding piece of arts in your local movie theatres.",The Grey
71,davispittman,A very well made film,9,29 December 2017,"The Grey (2011) is one of my favorites, and it is for many reasons. First of all, the plot. The plot consists of a plane full of men that crashes in the snowy freezing wilderness. There is a group of them, 7 to be exact, that ends up surviving. They must try their hardest to survive the extreme weather, plus a pack of vicious wolves that is hunting them. The plot really intrigued me, which is ultimately why I chose to watch. The plot was executed and carried out very well all the way through. The casting is another thing that the filmmakers did right. I'm not a huge Liam Neeson fan per say, but I do think he's a good actor and he did do a good job with this role, have a fine performance. Honestly, I loved Frank Grillo in his role, because yes, his character had cliché aspects to it, but as the film went on, that stereotype began to change and become something more. And I was pretty moved by Grillo's performance. Dermot Mulroney is another member of the cast I think did a pretty damn good job, he fit his particular role well. The writing was mostly pretty good, some of the lines were kinda cliché at times, but there was plenty good dialogue too, so the weaker lines were mostly forgotten/overshadowed.

Not at all.It was inevitable we'd see the small group of survivors slowly be picked off, with the one portrayed by the high-profile star being the last remaining. Even with that easily predictable outcome in mind, it's how the group must try to navigate and survive in the wild that holds the suspense and viewer engagement.To that end, while the excitement dips at points, there's at least enough going on here to keep you watching. There were even a few instances in the narrative that weren't necessarily surprising, but which took things in a slightly different way than I expected. And at least one jump scare that got me.The performances are fine (Neeson, as always, is the cream of the crop), and the film looks good. It's worth a watch.But I can't help wondering what could have been.'The grey' is 117 minutes long. The very beginning and the very end of the picture together contain what could have been an incredible, powerful movie, and one of the greatest credits to Liam Neeson's name, if this were a 15-20 minute short. However, in between those praiseworthy bookends are roughly 100 minutes about characters we barely know by name, and who we have no reason to care about except that Neeson's Ottway has taken them under his wing.The film we could have gotten is a story about a man who, for all his skills, is struggling to make it through each day. Challenged by circumstance to put those skills to the test, the relative isolation he placed himself in becomes ever more real as he ultimately finds himself alone in expansive wilderness. Reflecting once more on those things he has held most dear, he now has nothing to lose as his life is directly, immediately threatened.The film we got is that simple but impactful and artful story, bogged down by the constant push to make blockbusters.I suppose one could argue that the realization on film of Ottway's journey makes his emotional journey that much more substantial. But while I don't dislike 'The grey,' for my part the best parts of the film just get weighed down by what is, by comparison, simple excess.It's worth watching. But in the end my feeling is that there are 15-20 minutes I'd love to rewatch, and roughly 100 minutes for which one viewing was enough. Or in numerical terms: a possible 10-star rating, knocked down to a 6.",The Grey
76,valleyjohn,Another under the radar hit from Neeson.,8,16 March 2012,"THE GREY - 8 out of 10 A few years ago you would never have thought that Liam Neeson would become a star of action movies. We were used to him playing political and historical roles but four years ago he made a fantastic action movie called Taken which had a big cult following and despite a quite release at the cinema , became very popular through word of mouth . The Grey is another just like it. It Hardly got a mention when released but since has been praised by critics and quite rightly so.Neeson star as an oil rig worker who , along with his workmates , has a plane crash in the icy wilderness . There are several survivors but thanks to a hungry pack of wolves they might have wished they hadn't survived the crash.Although on the surface this may look like a man versus wolves film , if you dig a little deeper it's more than that. Sure there are lots of action scenes involving the fight against the pack of wolves but it's also about a man and his relationship with his partner and to a certain extent god. Do either exist ?Neeson is excellent , as is the rest of the cast and the film looks great and In a funny sort of way the battle with the wolves is more of a distraction than the main focus of the film.The Grey is a really good movie ( although not as good as Taken) and is highly recommended if your after something a bit different.",The Grey

Or nearly kill a movie in this case. Overall the film is acted well, shot fairly well and has a great script. The problem is how the director uses shaky cam and extreme close up shots during the stupid wolf attack scenes.

79,Samiam3,Well executed ....until the ending.,6,19 May 2012,"There is a reason that movies like The Grey get a winter release. The film not exactly Oscar season material; but at the same time, it is too moody and heavy in drama (among other things) to be summer entertainment. More than It is a very melancholy film, and few actors play melancholy better than Liam Neeson.Neeson is an oil worker in Alaska. Winter is coming, and he is flying home with his colleagues to the state capitol, when bad weather strikes and the plane goes down. He and six others survive the crash. While working their way south (hopefully back to civilization) they must survive the cold and the pack of angry wolves whose territory they are now in.The screenplay does a reasonable job of taking a handful of seemingly dull characters and making them sufficiently interesting. Even the few obnoxious characters end up being kind of sympathetic. As a thriller, the film moves well, and never feels too rushed or too slow. Liam Neeson gives a compelling performance while his buddies get picked off one by one. Where the movie stumbles however is the ending... and it stumbles hard. The Grey lacks the sense of closure that I think it needs to be satisfying. To say that the film is anti climactic is putting it mildly. The Grey is deliberately open ended, but it doesn't work. There is no sense of pay off for the investment that we have put into the previous hour and a half, and it leaves us with a protagonist whose story suddenly feels irrelevant.The Grey could have been such a knock out of a survival story. It has a well defined beginning, a middle, but no end. Is it a bad movie? not at all, but it left me somewhat unsatisfied... and cold.",The Grey

82,Seraphion,"Liam Neeson acted well, without sufficient focus on other threats",6,8 October 2014,"The opening feels like those for the lonesome drama mysteries. It develops the character only through narratives and shorts scenes strung together. Then the conflict starts, quite quickly, which is quite good because the main theme is the thriller aspect. Unfortunately, the main threat emphasized in this movie is the wolf pack. They take most of the focus of what the characters must be afraid of in the harsh snowy environment. All the other things such as hypothermia and hypoxia, and the conflict within the survivors are merely there as coloring to the whole movie. That being said, there's less real shots angled at the wolf pack. Yes we close up shots of them biting at the survivors, which are the only shots making them fear-worthy, but that's it. There's no real close ups shot at them when they're not attacking, which would add to the ferocious aura. Liam Neeson once again is being the center of the acting spotlight here. And he did quite alright, although the others kind of acted lamely.",The Grey
83,p-stepien,Philosophy by the numbers,6,24 September 2012,"Deep in Alaskan wilderness only wild things roam. Even people here consist mostly of outcasts, drifters, criminals and reclusive souls. Amongst them tormented by losing the love of his life is Ottway (Liam Neeson), a huntsmen responsible for protecting workers from rabid wolves and other assorted threats. After a plane crash leaves only him and six others hardened workers alive, he becomes the Alpha male of the survivors and the sole person capable of fending off the threat of a pack of rampant ruthless wolves.Beautifully shot in the white-covered mountain ranges of Alaska, snow an all-engulfing entity with a forceful life of its own, ""The Grey"" nervously attempts an artistically laden movie rife with philosophical overtones within the confines of a genre survivor thriller, where aliens and mutants monsters are supplanted by vengeful wolves. Unsure about true content hints are put in place, that the story will end with a stand-off, where human will confront the tenacity of the wolves. However going into the movie under the preconception that the base story is man vs wolves is bound to end with disappointment. The ultimate foes here aren't the blood-hungry mutts, but nature itself and human frailties, which takes survival of the fittest to a more basic, but mental level. One by one the survivors succumb first to their weaknesses, only then does it cause them to forfeit their lives. When only one man is left standing (guess who), despite having no further reason to live, he decides to never stand down and die fighting (""live and die on this day""), unlike those others who took on the journey.Amidst this struggled story a comment about the nature of death, the feeling of warmth it brings and the ultimate closure it offers (""dead is dead"". Amongst them discussions about god, afterlife and what awaits man on the other side. Religious men and atheists (amongst them Ottway) discuss gloomy opinions in the dire wilderness scenery, as if detached by the seemingly action-thriller story premise. In a moment of weakness however Ottway seeks deliverance from God, but none is forthcoming making him seek comfort and strength in memories of his beloved. Nature and God are merciless, man can count only on his own strengths despite his fragility.This bleak, cold movie rife with poignant moments and some brilliant subversive scenes (Ottway's flashbacks, a portrait of a dying man in the plane, the final battle between Ottway and the Alpha wolf), is too heavily submersed in some poor scripting in regards to the portrayal of surviving in the wilderness, not to mention a pretty vile portrayals of wild (and magically omnipresent) wolves (fully worth the controversy it has received). Unsure of whether the movie is first and foremost an action film or maybe a drama in the mold of ""Alive"", a collage of elements introduces chaos with the more noteworthy elements of the movies caught in the undertow of high-octane jumps off mountain cliffs and wolf chases. Not energetic enough through-out to keep the blood pumping it also isn't profound throughout to keep viewers cerebrally involved. That said certain scenes bite better than frost, meticulously well-executed and boosting the movie above your standard fare. Despite my misgivings the best moments ring brutally true, unrelenting and unforgettable. Shame this is bogged down by a truly ridiculous script...",The Grey
84,Rob_Taylor,The little movie that (almost) could....,6,6 March 2012,"This is a difficult movie to like. It has its good and bad points, but they balance out almost exactly. So why didn't I give this a 5/10? Let's look at the negatives first.The characters are in a plane crash, a modern aircraft, mind, not some old junker. I'm no aviation expert, but I'd like to bet it was fitted with a GPS/EPIRB black box. However, this did not appear to be so.Next, the decision to leave the wreckage and wander off to the trees (because there was better shelter there?) WTF? They could have patched up the wreckage enough to make a decent, wolf-proof shelter without too much effort. Wandering off was just about the dumbest thing to do.Falling into an icy, Alaskan river. Again, no expert on survival. But I'm guessing that doing that will mean you don't simply get out and walk off as if nothing was the matter. Hypothermia? Not in this movie.As you can see, there are a lot of annoying dumb things in the film. Now to the good bits.The scenes are well shot, for the most part, and the scenery is breathtaking. The acting is good to excellent, on the whole, and the slow erosion of the group as members die is nicely done.I give an extra mark for the reveal of the fate of Neeson's character's wife, which I admit, I did not see coming. A tiny thing, but important, to my mind.Otherwise, the movie is a little boring in places. Some scenes drag on longer than they should and the effects of the cold environment do little more than make the characters shiver, which counts against it.The movie was a nice attempt at being something a little different than the run-of-the-mill fare we are used to. But, as the tag-line suggest, it didn't quite make it. It's worth a watch, but I don't think many will rush to see it a second time.",The Grey

(spoiler) Starring Liam Neeson as a fatalistic but reserved hunter in the Freezing Bush after miraculously surviving a plane crash, this movie is a classic example of a story likely re-edited too much. Dialog is wholly awful, dreary, boring and wandering. It' meaningless and devoid of substance from the 2nd half on. The cinematography of the wolves is often sub-par. The end of the movie leaves you scratching your head - while it could be realistic given the circumstances, it cheapens and highlights just how excruciating the last hour of dialog has been.How this movie averages a ""7"" from general users and how it got green-lit into production is beyond me.

86,Chase_Witherspoon,Man vs Wild,6,1 January 2013,"Man versus wild with big Liam playing a sharp shooter employed by oil companies to protect their men working in remote parts of Alaska. When the plane on which he and other employees is travelling crashes, the survivors must not only contend with the cold and threat of starvation, but a pack of marauding wolves intent on protecting their patch.Heavy on the symbolic undertones that motivate Neeson's character, his deceased wife's memory fuelling his ambivalent behaviour and desire to leave the mortal coil, while recurring images of his father and the poem he wrote underscore a conflicted will to survive despite his grief. Together with Dermot Mulroney, Frank Grillo and Dallas Roberts (serious contender for John Ritter lookalike), the quartet mount something of a rearguard defence against the wolves, but their path to freedom is anything but assured.Some of the attack scenes are high quality, and the special effects don't diminish the film's integrity like so many recent forays into CGI. Not too sure about the film's ambiguous climax, but I suppose it's in keeping with the general tone, even if that is more than just a little morose.",The Grey
87,brando647,A Grim Tale of Man vs. his Mortality,8,21 August 2012,"I don't quite understand why Joe Carnahan's THE GREY was dumped into theaters in January, where it wouldn't really get much attention. Most of my friends aren't even aware it exists, but it's a seriously good movie. There were some complaints that the trailers and marketing were representing the movie as something it wasn't (particularly an important scene with Liam Neeson from the end of the movie) and I hope it wasn't enough to put people off from giving this movie a chance. It's a solid story with a talented cast and a classic premise: man vs. nature. It's grim and often brutal, and it doesn't pull any punches. Neeson is Ottway, a sharpshooter hired by an oil company to keep its crews safe as they work in the harsh Alaskan wilderness. He is accompanying a crew to a work site when their plane crashes and the survivors must band together to survive in hopes of rescue. Their situation worsens when it becomes apparent they've attracted the attention of a pack of wolves. The wolves stalk them, attacking when the men are at their weakest as they struggle to cross an unforgiving landscape. I was surprised to see such an intriguing movie from the man who brought us the big screen version of THE A-TEAM. You can't help but walk away from this movie with a feeling of gloom and helplessness, but I also found it incredibly thought-provoking. It tackles questions of faith and presents man at his most vulnerable, when he faces almost certain death.I guess it's misleading to claim this movie is man vs. nature. Really, nature just acts as the catalyst and the movie's main focus seems to be man vs. mortality. I wasn't kidding when I said this movie was glum; it's about death and coming face-to-face with it. From the beginning, when Ottway eases a man as he bleeds out following the crash into death while the remaining survivors stand near, petrified, this movie was about death. Maybe that's why I found this movie so interesting. It's one of the most real, most frightening movies I've seen that focuses on the subject. Liam Neeson is the only real A-list talent in the movie; the rest of the cast is made up of unfamiliars (with the exception of Dermot Mulroney but, I'll be honest, I didn't even recognize him). As a result, it's easier to buy into these guys as real people. A bunch of tough guys just trying to earn an honest living in one of the harshest living environments. Freezing cold, blinding snow, no sign of civilization for milesand now they're trapped with a pack of blood-thirsty wolves on their trail. Each of these men are developed with their own histories and, every time someone was lost, it was rough to watch. This stands as a testament for how strong the performances (and Carnahan's direction) were in this movie. It can be a tough watch at times, especially if you find yourself relating to these men.The wolves were more than a foundation for the whole ""confronting death"" bit. I loved that the characters in the movie sort of adapted their own ""pack"" structure as events progressed. You know, the whole ""man is an animal"" bit (which, if the audience hadn't picked up on, was blatantly thrown out their at one point by Frank Grillo's character). Ottway is the obvious alpha while Diaz (Grillo) is the group's omega, the two butting heads throughout until the inevitable confrontation. It adds an interesting layer to watch the men devolve into their own semi-primal states when dropped into this environment. The wolves themselves are beasts in this movie and work for the most part. There are some elements of CG that don't always work with the wolves but it's never enough to ruin the moment. The movie is powerful enough in its story and characters that little things like the occasional weak CG wolf doesn't do much to bring it down. I believe THE GREY is going to be one of those movies that slides into obscurity because of its odd release date and lack of attention. Neeson is at his best as Ottway; a conflicted man with no reason to live following the loss of his wife. His sole apparent drive to survive this catastrophe is to bring these men back to the lives they left behind. THE GREY was an awesome, if bleak movie and I hope others might stumble across it and give it a chance.",The Grey
88,bob-rutzel-1,Tension? Yes. Scary? Not so much,7,21 May 2012,"John Ottway's (Liam Neeson) job is to shoot wolves that come too close to men working on the oil pipeline in Alaska. On a flight home, the plane crashes and only a handful survive. The promos are more scary than the actual movie. Here is what we know. We never really see the wolves attack. We hear them attack. We see the results of an attack - some body parts in bright red. We only see the wolves from a distance and in very dark close-ups where all that is really seen are the eyes and some big teeth. We hear wolf calls, and growling throughout. Maybe the thought about what we don't see was supposed to make it more scary. Not in here. We see men who are frightened. They are without weapons and any real knowledge of wolves. The five survivors rely on Ottway to calm their fears as he knows things about wolves. Okay, to be fair, we kept waiting for a big attack which could come at any moment and this is where the tension builds and this keeps us riveted to our seats. We are kept waiting many times during whole movie and we sit there reaching for the popcorn but not looking to see where the dish is. This is where the movie succeeds. It's all in the waiting. They wait and we wait. And, attacks do come. And, sometimes quickly and we jump a little. Then we go back to waiting for the next attack. In this respect we are engaged and wonder who will be next to go. Who will survive all this? Will we?CGI was used for the wolves, but I felt this aspect was subdued somewhat, and could have been more menacing than it was. Had it not been subdued, then this would have been scary and I might have gone to bed with a light on for many nightsThe acting performances are very good even though I feel that acting frightened is not a big stretch for most actors. But it is the waiting and the not-knowing that conveys the tension and fear to us as we sit there with the popcorn wherever that dish is. This tension is so good throughout that we, too, are there having inserted ourselves into the frozen tundra; and we are like the men, waiting, wondering, hoping it all goes away and praying that Ottway is right in what he says. However, there are some moments that have Ottway demanding help via Divine Intervention.Definitely not for children.(7/10)Violence: Yes.

89,bkrauser-81-311064,The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Liam Neeson,7,11 February 2012,"""The Grey"" should be seen as a great example of mood cinema. Every frame is bursting at the seams with impending dread that I couldn't help cracking a smile while watching audience members squirming in their seats. Unfortunately while ""The Grey"" is a masterwork in comparison to other January releases, there are vast and obvious problems that sequesters this movie in the ""rent-it"" category.""The Grey"" follows a group of oil-drillers who's plane has crashed in the arctic tundra. Concluding no one will be out looking for them, the survivors march southward looking for civilization while being stalked by a pack of angry wolves.I say 'angry' and not, say 'hungry' because the wolves don't seem to be hunting them for food. Every time a character is picked off, they only seem to maul them to death then scamper away. It's obvious they're upset about something but that reason eludes me. One character claims that wolves are the only other creatures besides humans that kill for revenge but since it didn't come out of a wolf experts mouth I don't lend that theory much credence.Luckily they do have a wolf expert in their midst played by Liam Neeson a tortured man who nevertheless seems to know what he's doing. He assumes leadership of the band of survivors and make a series of increasingly poor decisions. Isn't the first rule of survival to stay where you are if you can? Sure they weren't in the most hospitable place in the arctic but they did have shelter and (gulp) food. The notion that no one would be out looking for them is patently ridiculous. Even if you're cynical enough to believe their bosses wouldn't care about their deaths, surely there were family members waiting at the airport wondering when their husband/boyfriend/father/brother were going to land. Plus wouldn't you have an advantage over carnivorous canines if you were out in the open and could see them coming versus in a forest where its harder to run and easier for them to hide? It wasn't all bad however: the location shots were eerily beautiful, the characters were well developed and the film's slight philosophical bent makes the film stand out from the rest of the pack. Their is much hubbub about the ending which I'll try not to spoil. I'll just say I didn't mind it; I just don't think everything that came before it was worth it which is why I think a lot of others found it jarring.If you're a casual moviegoer give ""The Grey"" a try but if you're a survival expert you might find yourself face-palming in disbelief.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/",The Grey
90,moviexclusive,"The rare survival tale that isn't just gripping but thoughtful and contemplative, thanks to a peerless performance by Liam Neeson",8,22 February 2012,"""Man is the weakest of animals- he is born naked and unarmed, without fangs, claws, horns or ""instinctual"" knowledge. Physically, he would fall an easy prey, not only to the higher animals, but also to the lowest bacteria; he is the most complex organism and, in a contest of brute force, extremely fragile and vulnerable. His only weapon—his basic means of survival—is his mind.""The survivalist movie 'The Grey' pits a half-dozen or so oil-rig rouchnecks against a den of rabid wolves, and though the man-versus- nature premise has probably been done to death, writer/director Joe Carnahan's portrayal of that elemental struggle for survival breathes new life into the genre by being unusually thoughtful and philosophical. Indeed, right from the beginning, Carnahan brings an unexpected sobriety to the proceedings by introducing his protagonist Ottway as a deeply troubled man who has lost his will and purpose to live.The riveting prologue not just hints that Ottway has somehow lost someone very close and important in his life, but also establishes his suicidal state of mind as he brings the barrel of his gun to his mouth after killing a grey wolf. In Liam Neeson's trademark gravelly voice, we learn that the sharpshooter who has seen his fair share of killing over the years now makes his living protecting the riggers out in the Alaskan wilderness, but can't quite figure out why he's now safeguarding a bunch of men he describes as ""unfit for mankind"". Ottway is quickly put to the test when the transport plane ferrying him and his co-workers home after a gruelling five-week shift crashes into the wilderness in the midst of a blinding blizzard. That terrifically exciting sequence is just one of many similarly thrilling ones to come, as Carnahan and his cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi display an uncanny ability of thrusting their audience right into the heart of the peril facing the characters. Only a fortunate handful survive, the fragility at which life is so easily lost emphasised by a stirring moment where Ottway holds the hand of one of the dying and tells him not to fight it, and another where a fellow survivor says a prayer for the dead while thanking God for sparing and helping those who lived.Nonetheless, Ottway and the ragtag group of survivors- Burke (Nonso Anozie), Henrick (Dallas Roberts), Talget (Dermot Mulroney) and Diaz (Frank Grillo)- realise that death in this instance might be the easier way out as they are forced to traverse the harsh wintry terrain in order to escape from wolves. Aside from Ottway, it's anyone's guess how long the others will survive- and Carnahan and his co-screenwriter Ian Mackenzie Jeffers are shrewd enough not to paint any of the supporting characters in the caricatured way lesser movies often do that inevitably give away the surprise. Instead, like Ottway, they impress as strong independent-minded characters with their individual motivations to stay alive.So they do what is necessary to survive- crafting improvised weapons, taking turns to keep watch at night, building fires at every rest stop- while admirably never leaving their fellow men, wounded or otherwise, literally to the dogs. Their fundamental struggle is told with unvarnished clarity, and Carnahan's attention to the little details in every scene makes the journey thoroughly mesmerising every step of the way. Despite the primitive nature of the struggle, there is something lyrical about the proceedings, illuminating the stark truth that man's most formidable weapon against nature's beasts is mind and spirit.Appropriately, the climax pits the alpha male from both species- though audiences looking for that rush of pure adrenaline as man is reduced to the level of a beast in order to confront one will likely be disappointed. Yes, consider this as fair warning that Carnahan doesn't reward those looking for some action payoff at the end; but in those final moments of ambiguity, he reiterates the salient purpose of Ottway's drive to keep himself and the rest of the others alive as best he can- but stay right through the end credits for a final coda that hints at the outcome of the climactic showdown.At the heart of this harrowing movie is Liam Neeson, whose perfect combination of intelligence and masculinity holds it together from start to finish. Though the Irish actor found himself catapulted to iconic status just three years ago with his slick actioner 'Taken', Neeson is so much more than just an action star- and 'The Grey' while marketed to draw audiences taken with his earlier movie efficiently blends both his newfound action star qualities with his well-established dramatic roots. It's no overstatement to say that Neeson is terrific in the role, demonstrating with utmost keenness his character's fragility beneath the bravado.And with Neeson, Carnahan has made a movie with the right balance of action and emotion that is thrilling, heartfelt and unexpectedly meditative. Beyond the man-beast polemic oft explored in such genre pictures, it isn't afraid to go one step further to confront a more challenging spiritual dilemma- that of whether life is really worth fighting for, or death is really worth fighting against. So poetically is its very essence embodied in the words of this short recurring poem pivotal in Ottway's existence:Once more into the frayInto the last good fight I'll ever knowLive and die on this day,Live and die on this day.And like the quote at the beginning of the review, it isn't just a viscerally gripping survival tale, but one that embraces the very cerebral nature of every man-animal battle worth its weight.",The Grey

Not only the harsh environment for the remaining survivors have to deal with, the movie decided to throw in Northern Arctic Wolves and that made the survivors a living nightmare of hell. Only reason why I gave the movie a 8 star was Ottway (Liam Neeson) was a huntsman.

This icy wilderness edge-of-seater is a master class in building and sustaining tension, only allowing the audience to let their guard down at moments when more terror is about to suddenly rear its ferocious head. Carnahan wisely puts a lot of focus on what we hear too; from the heart-pounding sound design (the airplane crash sequence is phenomenal) to the affecting score, your ears are put to use as much as your eyes – which are treated to the outstandingly atmospheric cinematography – all combining for a fully immersive and chilling experience. Throw in a group of engaging characters you genuinely want to see survive as a ragtag bunch – led by Liam Neeson's troubled Ottway – trying to conquer the severe Alaskan weather and the even more nightmarish wolves stalking them, and this is a near-perfect man vs. wild thriller.",The Grey
95,antoniotierno,"A noteworthy film, though a bit predictable.",7,7 December 2012,"The Grey is a combination of character-focused exchanges as well as an intense nature and/or wolf action encounters. That said, a lot of moviegoers will likely find that certain characters and their various interactions are ultimately enough to carry the film – at least from action set piece to action set piece. Liam Neeson offers(as usual) his subtle but likable intensity and his portrayal – coupled with some compelling (but not overdone) flashback material - makes him a worthwhile focal point for the unfolding events. Nevertheless it's those unfolding events, along with the wonderful filming locations, that make The Grey a riveting movie-going experience, more than the survival experts.",The Grey
96,ketgup83,Liam Neeson's brave performance makes it worth watching !!!,7,2 April 2012,"The grey was an out-an-out action thriller that is definitely worth watching at least once thanks to an outstanding performance by Liam Neeson. John Ottway (Liam Nesson)works as animal huntsman working in oil company. On an assignment, he must travel to different place along with other employees of the company . Owing to bad weather condition, their plane crashes in the midst of snow-clad region. Few of the survivors along with John must be on their toes as they have to fight the extreme cold weather but more than that they need to fight the ferocious, man- eating , merciless wolves watching every step closely. The Grey , based on short stories ""Ghost Walker"" is directed by Joe Carnahan. Joe came out with something different and result was fruitful. The direction was upto the mark along with a captivating story. Dialogues were punching along excellent camera work capturing the exotic location of Alaska. The background score was nice. Only I wish the screenplay could have been more crispy. Coming to the performance, it is Neeson's show all the way. The legendary actor does everything of what it takes to be natural. Watch out for his change in expression in the climax from a destined-to-be-in-situation guy to a fighter who must live at the end of the day. He is just awesome in every frame captured. Overall , a very well-crafted film. Watch it because of stupendous performance given by Liam Neeson. Watch till the credit ends and you will like it more. Good – 3.5 /5",The Grey
97,TheUnknown837-1,"It is a movie with a lot going for it, but insists on shooting down its accolades with a counteracting flaw.",6,7 February 2012,"Joe Carnahan's ""The Grey"" must have been a nightmare to shoot, and that's too bad, for the end result is a man-versus-nature thriller that is most of the time not very exciting. It is a movie with a lot going for it, but insists on shooting down its accolades with a counteracting flaw. It has good ideas muddled by a screenplay lacking passion. It has a cast full of great actors with no real parts to play. And it has beautiful background scenery, but a cinematographer who prefers to hide it behind excessive usage of close-ups that nauseated me, reminding me of third-rate television movies.The trailers tell you all you need to know. Liam Neeson, one of our very best actors, stars as a man unhappy with himself and his life, who is involved in a plane crash in Alaska. He, and seven others survive the crash, only to find out that they are being stalked by a pack of timber wolves. With Mr. Neeson taking charge, the survivors gear up and try to brave the elements while dodging the wolves. An excellent premise, but handled without passion.Director Carnahan wrote the screenplay with Ian Mackenzie Jeffers, who based it on his short story ""Ghost Walker."" And their core mistake seems to have been forgetting that the source material was a short story, and that they needed to build upon it to create a white-hot, exciting wilderness yarn rather bloating it up like a balloon with a lot of hot air. A number of the characters improbably survive the plane crash. Far too many, as none of them have any real personality and cannot justify their being on the screen for so long. Despite their best efforts, Mr. Neeson, and the other actors (which include Dallas Roberts, Frank Grillo, Dermot Mulroney, and Joe Anderson) have no characters to flesh out. Mr. Grillo is given the most thankless role as the expected vulgar skeptic, who would rather pick fights than work for mutual survival.It also does not help that the characters do not follow human logic. Not even in a movie-sense. For instance, we see early on that Mr. Neeson carries a rifle. So after they have crashed and are looking for food, why does he not look for it first? Why later when they are just about to flee into the woods? And why the woods? Why not stay with the plane? Why go into the trees where the bloodthirsty wolves can hide and stalk you? Maybe the characters realized their mistake too late when more of them started getting picked off after this point.It becomes really hard to care about any of their fates. It took me well over an hour to remember any of the character names, and even then that was only because the wolves had reduced the cast to three, so it was a little easier. But that was all, not because they had any personality. And whenever a character met their fate, my reaction was one of complete indifference because they did not seem like real people to me. They were just there to gripe and be torn to shreds.Speaking of the wolves, they are also not that interesting. We do not see them most of the time, and when we do, their scenes are rather anticlimactic, and outstay their welcome. Director Carnahan prefers to toss out the Hitchcock suspense theory in favor of ""Boo!"" moments, where a character is standing still (usually in close-up, so you can't see anything but him) when WHAM, a wolf attacks him from behind and we get a lot of confusing shots, filmed way too close, perhaps to hide the phony prop wolf-heads which are the most unconvincing man-eaters I've seen in a theatrical release since ""The Ghost and the Darkness."" The rest of the time, they are computer-generated and unfortunately, you can tell they are. I was always aware the wolves were not real, that they were drawn in by a computer and were not really occupying the same three-dimensional space as the actors whom they were rendering to piles of blood and strewn meat.Not to mention that we see never see any wildlife at all besides the wolves.Mr. Carnahan uses the ""Boo!"" motif for his action scenes so much that after a while, it became rather depressing. And good moments, such as the characters creating a makeshift bridge to cross a chasm, were ruined for me because I was waiting for the scene to be ruined by another lame moment where the soundtrack would be erupting with thuds and screams and the screen would be crammed with blurry images. He has also directed ""The Grey"" without much style. He and his cinematographer, Masanobu Takayanagi, draw on the television-movie format, using far too many close-ups, even in shots where the characters are out in open fields and there's no need to go for claustrophobia. And then when it gets a chance to use long shots, such as in a drippy would-be emotional scene by a river toward the end, he uses it so excessively, and without montage that it almost seems as if the film had changed directors midway.""The Grey"" is a valiant attempt in following the tradition of its betters, such as Lee Tamahori's ""The Edge"" and John Boorman's ""Deliverance."" But in the end, it really just results as a not-very-thrilling wander-picture clumsily mixed with a SyFy Channel monster movie. If the filmmakers had worked on the screenplay a little more, used suspense as opposed to shock value, and pulled back on their camera lens a bit so we could see more than just the actors' faces half the time, ""The Grey"" might have been a modern-day classic. Folks who despise cliffhanger-endings also beware, for the last shot of the movie will leave you squirming with disappointment, and what you see after the credits have rolled won't aid your frustration much, either.",The Grey
98,NijazBaBs,"Reality, Survival, Faith, Religion, bad ending",8,25 March 2019,"This is another Liam Neeson's movie in which he is the main actor. There were 2 more famous actors I recognized, one of which is from Prison Break series. Everything in movie is about real life, meaning all we may sometime experience and confront with or have problem with, such as religion, death, survival, accident, emergency, worry, fight. The only bit unreal thing are fake wolves, but even they are good enough. I did not like bad and unfinished ending. And did not like simplicity and lack of mystery. Good to watch only if you like reality, and do not demand positivity. This movie brings into question important life matters especially our ability or inability to believe in God.",The Grey
99,blott2319-1,Intense and powerful battle for life,7,22 August 2020,"One of the things I heard from people who didn't love The Grey was that the trailers set you up for the wrong kind of movie. It's probably good that I didn't see it in theaters so I never had that experience of expecting a film about Liam Neeson fist-fighting a wolf, and instead could appreciate the story this movie had to offer. I think it's an interesting journey that the film takes us on, as we see the main character journey from a place where he is about to give up on life, to a literal fight for survival. Liam Neeson is great at showing the emotional transition, and I love the way his powerful personality takes charge in the film. They also have some fun with the idea of the humans echoing behaviors of the wolves that are pursuing them, although it might be a bit heavy-handed with the direct metaphor.I'm glad that this tale of survival didn't go down the cannibalism route. I feel as though I've seen enough of those movies to last a lifetime, and it was more interesting to see these men fighting nature's predators rather than one another all the time. There is some petty bickering among the men, and I found that tedious when it came up, but it seemed logical considering the desperation of their situation. Given how the story unfolds in The Grey, I can't exactly say it was an enjoyable thing to watch. It is dark and gets quite depressing at times. However, for the type of movie they were trying to make, I think it was effective. I was tense throughout, and felt the overwhelming sense of dread with the characters. I wouldn't call The Grey rewatchable, but it's a movie I'm glad I saw once.",The Grey

The effects are great and the slow, beautiful flashback scenes make the action sequences even more dramatic to the point you can almost feel the snow on your skin.Then unfortunately it all starts to unravel. The more screen time the wolves receive the less scary and authentic they become. Some of the wolves are obvious glove puppets others have been knocked up on a play station. This I could forgive but not when a host of eyes materialise out of the dark like a Scooby Doo cartoon.This film is bleak with not even a glimmer of light relief. The wolves attack relentlessly the men push-on relentlessly. There is little scope for the story to progress or even to change the scenery.The survivors have what feels like a million camp fire chats, some of the dialogue about missing their kids etc. is bearable but on the whole it is very dull.Great acting, good action; the wolves could have been better and the story less liner.",The Grey

For one thing, the F word is used between 500 and 1000 times. Lazy writing, but accepted.CGI wolves can't kill you, can't bite you, can't scratch you, can't scare an intelligent audience. There have been wolves in movies for over 75 years, scary as hell, but only since CGI do they look plastic and silly. Yet many empty-headed moviegoers go mostly for the CGI.Even CGI wolves would choke on the menagerie of born losers portrayed in this movie.

Got just that.",The Grey
103,KnightsofNi11,A great big stupid success,6,15 September 2014,"Never have I been so confused by a film's advertising than The Grey. It seemed to be advertised as an action movie with Liam Neeson doing battle with wolves in Alaska, but I had no clear idea of where the film would actually go. I think it was this confusion that kept me from seeing the movie when it first came out, but yesterday I finally gave it a shot.The Grey is a movie with Liam Neeson and Alaskan wolves, but it's not an action movie. It took me a while to figure out what exactly this movie was, but I think I finally came to the realization that it's a creature feature disguised as a horror film disguised as an action film. It takes place in middle of nowhere Alaska after Liam Neeson lives through a plane crash and must lead a group of other pitiful survivors to safety while they are hunted by vengeful and highly territorial wolves. As you can imagine, the men start getting picked off one by one slasher film style as they trudge through the harsh Alaskan wilderness.The Grey is one of those films that benefits from having no preconceptions going in. If you take the film as is you can actually have a pretty good time. If you are expecting an action movie, you won't get that. If you're expecting a survival thriller, you will sort of get that, but whoever expected a monster movie from The Grey would actually be the most satisfied. This movie is two hours of surprisingly well paced monster survival horror. The impending threat of the wolves grows more and sinister and nerve wracking as the survivor's numbers dwindle, each of them getting picked off as gruesomely and gut wrenching as possible. These supposedly realistic depictions of wolves build dramatic tension as if they were standard movie monsters and, for as silly as that gets, it somehow makes this movie a hell of a lot of fun.This movie doesn't offer much more than B-movie horror hidden underneath a multi-million dollar budget and Neeson's A-list star power, but if you can accept that it makes it a whole lot easier to enjoy. For all of its shortcomings this flick is actually an incredible technical and visual spectacle. Masanobu Takayanagi's cinematography is gorgeous, capturing Alaska's desolate white wasteland in all of its sprawling hopelessness. Long shots suck you into the film's harrowing tension, and the haunting expanse of Alaska captured in such a way leaves you feeling just as uncomfortable and squeamish as the film's characters.Then there's the film's stellar sound design that vigorously draws you in and immerses you in this intense visceral experience. The Grey's thrills and plethora of malicious jump scares are all complimented by booming sound design, an element that really ties this film together. It also has one of the most abrasive, loud, and outright awesome plane crash scenes I've seen in recent movie memory; one that literally shook the neighborhood.Between the plane crash and the introduction of the menacing wolf antagonists The Grey starts out really well. It only starts to crash and burn when our group of careless, idiotic, and downright unlikable characters start to open their mouths. The writer in me wants to hate The Grey for all of its sophomoric dialogue trying desperately to be profound via superficial motifs concerning man vs nature and man facing his own mortality. I want to hate it for it's cast of one dimensional dimwits who hardly deserved to live. I want to hate it for all of its pointlessness, stupidity, and laughably weak attempts at meaningful dialogue.And yet there is just enough in here to keep me from this hatred. There are just enough things that The Grey does exceptionally well that turned me around to actually really enjoying it. It's way better than a whole slew of other horror/survival/monster movies and, despite how shallow the results, it at least attempted to have a deeper meaning. If you want to be thrilled, frightened, and just plain entertained, then I would suggest watching The Grey.",The Grey
104,jon.h.ochiai,"Great ""Grey""",9,31 January 2012,"""The Grey"" is amazing. Not necessarily for what you would think. In ""The Grey"" Alaskan oil workers survive a horrendous airplane crash on route to Anchorage. They are hunted down by ferocious Grey wolves. According to Liam Neeson's Ottway the Greys' territory covers 300 miles, and the den's kill radius is 30 miles. They are on their turf. Director and Writer Joe Carnahan's vision is stark and emotionally haunting. Neeson plays Ottway, who is an expert marksman who kills wolves threatening Alaskan oil pipeline workers. Neeson embodies a sad gravitas in Ottway. In the opening scene we get that he is tortured by dreams of his late wife, beautiful and serene Anne Openshaw. He composes a letter to her. Ottway may suffer clinical depression which culminates in an aborted tragic act. Following the visually dramatic crash, Ottway (Neeson) stares into the eyes of a passenger with bleeding abdomen, and says, ""You are going to die"" He calmly guides him through this. ""The Grey"" is about how each of us faces death. ""The Grey"" is poignantly profound and sublime. Carnahan and Ian MacKenzie Jeffers's screenplay based on Jeffers's short story ""Ghost Walker"" is surprising in narrative and catharsis. Director Carnahan creates the existential arctic wasteland and the paradox of man as prey. Masanobu Takayanagai's cinematography is haunting—seeing the wolves' eyes glowing against the darkness and snow is terrifying and stunning. There is a visceral sense of danger in the icy air that fuels ""The Grey"". Ottway leads the group to the forest ridge line as a means to their salvation. Frank Grillo is gritty as fierce poser. Dermot Mulroney is inspired as dedicated father Talget. Dallas Roberts is solid support as sensible Hendrick. Liam Neeson is awesome. ""The Grey"" is powerful, because of him. As Ottway, he is a compassionate broken hero journeying through redemption. Neeson is so convincing as a man taking action in the face of his own grave fear. Neeson has an amazing scene where Ottway, recalls the poem of his drunk and abusive father, ""Into the fray Live and die on this day."" Neeson captures the conflicting toil of a man, who had little to live for now fighting to survive and protect the lives of others. He is powerful. In context this is somberly poetic; ""The Grey"" is about how each of us reconciles death. T.S. Eliot wrote: ""This is the way the world ends. Not with a bang, but a whimper."" With inspired contrast Neeson and Carnahan in ""The Grey"" the hero never folds and fights on. ""The Grey"" is provocative and subtly profound.",The Grey
105,TOMASBBloodhound,Nature just is.,9,19 August 2012,"Watching this fine film reminded me of the way I felt about The Endurance, a film coincidentally narrated by Neeson. It was also the tale of several seemingly brave souls hopelessly lost someplace very cold. Though this film is fiction where The Endurance was fact, one idea rings true from both: Nature is indifferent to our plight as humans. We live by its terms. We can log it, drill into it, pollute it, cultivate it, whatever have you. But we as humans, despite all of our technological advancements are completely insignificant in the face of nature. The Grey was marketed as some kind of action picture where stranded men must fight off a pack of wolves in a rural area of the arctic. The wolves, though deadly, are only a small part of the problem these characters face. If the wolves don't get them something else will. And there just isn't much chance of rescue.Liam Neeson plays a man hired by an oil company to shoot any wolf that gets too close to their workers out in the field. Though Neeson's character has a low opinion of his life in general, and clearly longs for better times, he is also quite good at his job. Early on, he finds himself on a passenger jet full of his fellow oil workers that crashes in some unknown part of Alaska. Ever really look at a map of Alaska? Its almost as big as the other 49 states combined, but with only a few hundred thousand people. Help could be beyond the next ridge for the handful of survivors, or it could be hundreds of miles away. Maybe they should have stayed near the wreckage where there was at least some cover. But the area of the crash site is full of aggressive wolves who don't seem to like visitors. No matter what Neeson and the others do, death is waiting around every tree, rock, or bend in a river. The film becomes a test of each man's desire to keep on living. Neeson, whose character was nearly suicidal in the early scenes, now seems to be the men's only chance. But how badly does he want to live himself?The Grey is a brutal, downbeat experience. It is a terrific movie that will likely haunt you for a while after its over. It is not a film about heroism, only survival. Its interesting to see these blue collar tough guys go from braggadocios louts whose every other word seems to be ""m*****f*****"" to beaten, vulnerable lost souls. The wolves attack from the icy hell around them not out of hunger, but to protect their territory. These are some ferocious types that Jack London never wrote about. The acting is top-drawer from a mostly unknown cast. Neeson has found a good niche these days as an everyman ass-kicker. Good to see he is keeping busy since his real life wife's passing. By all means, take a look at this film. Not quite the adventure it may have seemed when marketed, but a gripping drama that will make you question your own will to live. Are you making good use of the time you've been given? 9 of 10 stars.The Hound.",The Grey
106,petra_ste,Liam versus schwolves,5,5 July 2018,"I like Liam Neeson a lot. Not only he can act; he is effortlessly cool, with a strong, magnetic presence many ripped colleagues half his age can only dream of.Neeson, by far the best thing about the picture, plays Ottway, one of the survivors of a plane crash in Alaska; the group struggles against cold, starvation and a pack of wolves. And what wolves they are...! Let's call them ""schwolves"", because they really have nothing in common with the actual Canis Lupus: relentless and sadistic, they make the Beast of the Gévaudan look like a Pomeranian.Artistic licenses about ethology aside, I am not too crazy about the movie's script by emerging screenwriter Joe Carnahan. First and more notable, even disregarding the schwolves, there is a streak of nonsense running through the story. Gritty survival dramas don't need to be 100% realistic but, more than in other genres, the characters' main decisions need to stand up to scrutiny. Ottway orders the group to abandon the plane's wreckage, where they would have partial shelter from cold and animals and at least a chance of being found... why? Because, he casually states as if it's not even worth discussing, nobody will find the plane. Oh, okay. Ever heard of ELTs?Then he pushes his companions to reach the woods, where they'll be, get this, safer from wolves. Am I missing something? Maybe the movie's schwolves just love plane wreckages but avoid woods? No they don't, woods prove to be most unsafe for the group. That's a truly shocking development.Am I supposed to think that Ottway is an idiot? Obviously not, because the script clearly wants us to be in awe of him and of the ludicrous factoids about animals and survival he spouts. Maybe his phone does have a signal and he is just googling this stuff from some very stupid site.Aside for Ottway, characters are flat and underdeveloped - except Frank Grillo's Diaz, who gets even too much exposure as the obligatory Angry Jerkass (of the more benign ""who eventually learns to cooperate"" variety). I am also not impressed by the movie's attempts at depth, with garden-variety nihilism and overcompensating masculine stoicism. Before the end there is a scene where Ottway screams his desperation at the sky... and God doesn't answer. Wow, deep. Good thing you have your dad's crap inspirational poem to motivate you, Ottway.A wasted opportunity; pity, because Neeson is always good and I enjoyed the straightforward premise, which does lead to some effectively tense moments.5,5/10",The Grey
107,spookyrat1,Pitch Black blended with Arctic White resulting in The Grey!,6,25 July 2020,"I've rarely seen a film that has so many apologist advocates. ""It's an allegory."" ""The wolves aren't really wolves. They just represent some sort of danger."" ""This is not a perfect film, but it deserves 10/10 anyway."" (LOL!) "" This film is just so misunderstood."" So much twaddle! Call it for what it really is. Joe Carnahan's The Grey is a well produced, but very average survival film dressed up with a few mumbo-jumbo philosophical ramblings concerning the existence or otherwise of God and the lack of divine interventions on Earth.The problems with many of these survival movies is that right from the outset there is the absence of a common sense foundation premise. In The Grey's case, a jet carrying roughly 50 oil workers goes down and immediately we're asked to accept that the survivors have to get on the move, because of the most absurd reasons. 1 The snow will cover the plane and searchers won't see them. 2 They're in wolf territory. For the convenience of kicking a movie story off, we're asked to virtually accept there will be no search for survivors of what would certainly be an event of national, if not global, newsworthiness. It's quite ridiculous. Of course the survivors should stay with the plane, where they will be virtually guaranteed to be found inside 24 hours. You know: radar-tracking, GPS, all that other 21st century paraphernalia, that's just so easily ignored in The Grey.But what about those dangerous wolves? I'd be hard-pressed to name an animal that has been so unfairly maligned and targeted over centuries, as a vicious man-eating creature. And just when world populations are starting to gain a general acceptance of the complete falsehood behind this labelling of wolves, which has led to their complete decimation in parts of the world, along comes Joe Carnahan and Ian MacKenzie Jeffers to reinforce the stereotype to the easily influenced masses once again. Yes, wolves are wild animals and wild animals are called ""wild"" for a reason. But they don't run around in large packs as seen in this movie picking off full grown men. There's been only 4 confirmed North American attacks over the last 50 years and they were all solo victims, one being a young child whose family had a ""pet wolf"". Battling to survive films where the predators are at least partially realistic (Jaws) or alien (Alien, Predator) have far more reasonance, than stuff like The Grey, where the enemy to be faced is just patently preposterous.The Grey is well shot in the snowy wilds of Canada (substituting for Alaska), so as a landscape survival saga it offers some rugged wintry vistas. It also features a central performance from Liam Neeson whose compelling physical presence in surviving both the elements and a relentlessly dumb script is admirable. It undeniably has some moments of high drama and suspense, but its central presumptions are fatally flawed.",The Grey

This film's moral is that everyman should fight for his life till his last breath. If ever a circumstance should arrive in your life that forces you in a live or die predicament, you must FIGHT FOR YOUR LIFE!Back to the film: veteran actor Liam Neeson stars in the film adaptation of the short story Ghost Walker by Ian MacKenzie Jeffers, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Carnahan.Neeson plays John Ottway who works in Alaska killing the wolves that threaten an oil drilling team. On his last day on the job, Ottway writes a letter to his wife Ana (Anne Openshaw) who has left him, that he plans to commit suicide. While holding the barrel of the Winchester Model 70 in his mouth, Ottway hears the howl of a wolf, which stops him. Upon completing the job, the team and Ottway head home on a plane that crashes in a blizzard. Ottway then sees a vision of his wife but awakens to find one of the team, Lewenden (James Badge Dale), mortally wounded. Ottway calms him, letting him know that he is going to die, and then Lewenden dies peacefully.From then onwards, a pack of gray wolves led by a dominant alpha male terrorize the rest of the survivors and kill them one by one.The most moving scene in the film for me is when Ottway pulls out each wallet collected from the dead, examines the mementos they contain. Overall this is a film you will NEVER FORGET, and this is undoubtedly John Carnahan's best film.Similar survival films: Open Water, Cube Trilogy(1,2,3), Alive, Midnight Express, Papillon, The Great Escape, Escape From Sobibor, Fortress, Triumph Of The Spirit, Misery, Tremors, Of Unknown Origin.",The Grey

112,jdkraus,A case study of existentialism...we are all screwed,5,19 December 2012,"""The Grey"" is a rather bleak movie. It centers on John Ottway (Liam Neeson), a hunter who has lost his wife and spends his time working for a big oil company in Alaska. When the company jet, with all the workers on board, crashes, he jumps into action to save the survivors from the freezing temperatures, starvation, and death. Even worse, a pack of carnivorous hunts them down, one-by-one, forcing them into a game of hunter and hunted. Sounds great, but why does this make it so dejecting? The movie presents itself as a case of existentialism—there is no hope for these survivors. They are to be hunted down like lambs to the slaughter. Without our guns, we may not be at the top of the food chain. Even more disappointing is the climax, for the movie cuts before it is revealed. Does the last man make it or not? We don't know. I like the whole idea of existentialism—but the way the film shows it does not deliver.While Neeson's character is developed very well, the other characters are lukewarm at best. Rather than feeling pity for their fates, we merely nod our heads, anticipating them to die like bad actors in a B-horror flick. The wolves are even presented as demonic beings that lurk in the dark with glowing, menacing eyes. It is hard not see which direction this movie is heading towards. In addition, it is poorly filmed with overexposed interiors shots and dimly lit night scenes. Half of the time, I could not see what was happening. The blood and gore and overly sentimental score help make up for it. This movie could have been very good, even a masterpiece. But if suffers from poor character development, bad lighting, and terrible marketing. Even the title ""The Grey"" does not pertain to anything with the story, save of course for the wolves fur. I really wanted to enjoy this movie, but I can't. At least Neeson has given another great performance.",The Grey
113,JohnRayPeterson,"Simple, gripping, beautiful and engaging; one of the better survival films.",8,17 May 2012,"I have to praise Ian Mackenzie Jeffers and Joe Carnahan for a terrific script as well as the latter for a fine piece of directing. I like much of his work and have seen most of what he's written and or directed in recent years; he is versatile and happily, in this movie, he has shown us he can do excellent character development work. I can hardly think of anyone better than Liam Neeson for the lead role. The premise of the movie is rather straightforward: A sharpshooter, Neeson, hired to protect roughnecks working at an oil facility in Alaska, from local wildlife, boards with them on a plane as they set off for their periodic break; a storm hits the plane hard and it crashes, killing most aboard. The remaining group of survivors attempt to make out of the tundra, with wolves at their heels.Not since the 2010 movie ""The Way Back"" have I seen a survival movie with as good cinematography, outstanding soundtrack and deep character development. Neeson plays a character both haunted and sooth by the memory of his wife through flashbacks he has when he tries to mentally escape their predicament, a back-story that keeps us intrigued; wolves are the dominant specie of that wasteland and the movie makes us feel that intensely. Nature is the other foe in this drama. Both the plane crash scenes and the shots of the tundra, and later the Alaska wilderness are done with a flair for realism. The movie caps off as it finally lets us in on the story of Neeson's wife, so we can understand the earlier passages of his melancholia; then the very last shots are a truly poetic finale. The movie deserves all the good critics and rating it has received so far.",The Grey
114,DarthVoorhees,"Liam Neeson is a special breed of actor, the kind that can polish garbage...",6,30 August 2012,"Liam Neeson is one of the most talented and magnetic actors alive. I have yet to see a performance from him that wasn't well thought out or displayed some level of creativity. Neeson adds gravitas to a character and I get taken in even if the character is poorly written. Liam needs a new agent because he's chosen a string of stinkers. He is not the action hero Hollywood is trying to mold him into, he's far too old and forgive me if I sound pretentious but talented too. 'The Grey' does not deserve a Liam Neeson headlining it. The character of Ottoway is composed entirely of clichés. This movie coasts on clichés until the screenplay implodes on it;s self in one of the most abrupt and uninspired endings imaginable. This film needed at least two more screenplay drafts before being film able. Neeson is a special breed of actor in that he carries this mess of a movie entirely on his shoulders and makes it semi-watchable. What we have with 'The Grey' is nothing more than a body count movie. Neeson is the only character that matters and the rest are just food for the fake C.G.I wolves. The entirety of the movie and whatever value someone gets from it is Neeson spewing survival clichés. I've heard them before and to be honest I've heard them delivered much better than Neeson here. In the hands of a lesser actor I would rip this film a new one but Liam Neeson God bless him believes what he says with the utmost sincerity. I can't help but respect an actor who takes a garbage script and treats it like Hamlet. What Neeson does in his action films that many actors can learn from is he invests himself in the stakes of the story. There's a believability through a vulnerability portrayed by Neeson and you never see that from an action star. His creeds and mottos are silly and yet we get the sense that instead of merely being silly bad ass sayings that they exist to move our character forward. Ottway challenges God at his lowest and it actually feels like we are watching a different movie...The thrills are what really frustrate me about this picture. The CGI wolves are just about the most fake computer generated villainy you could imagine. What happened to the days of 'Jaws' where the horror was left to the imagination? I'd rather seeing nothing than seeing these nonthreatening and silly looking creatures. Essentially 'The Grey' is cheap manufactured goods. Neeson elevates it where I can look past the uninspired Hollywood Bologna, at least for a little bit.",The Grey

One thing he brought with him to his first movie after his brush with blockbuster territory was an actor who guarantees moviegoers and critics will pay attention to him - Liam Neeson. ""The Grey"" delivers from the standpoint of a film. You get characters developed enough to care about and some surprises here and there. Carnahan's story and direction get's the viewer emotionally invested. This isn't for the faint of heart.

116,MattyGibbs,Realistic- No. Entertaining - Yes.,9,20 January 2013,A lot has been made of the fact that this isn't a realistic portrayal of Wolves. Correct it isn't however this is an entertainment film not a nature documentary so does it matter? The film follows seven survivors of an plane crash and their attempts to escape. Yes you can pull all kinds of holes in the choices they make but the film flows along nicely with some good action moments. It sags maybe a little in the middle but the ending is pretty perfect in my opinion. This isn't a standard predictable action film and is more a take on how people deal with their imminent death. The film was helped by a very good performance by the charismatic Liam Neeson and to be fair this film may have failed with a lesser actor as the main protagonist. Overall an enjoyable and at times tense film. Well worth a watch unrealistic or not.,The Grey

Those who loved it saw a competently directed action horror film in a realistic setting filled with real people facing real threats. Those who hated it saw an unrealistic depiction of wildlife behavior and unworkable outdoor skills. People who loved it thought the movie was realistic. People who hated it thought it was ridiculous. Without giving away the story, let me tell you that this is not a story about actual wolf behavior. This is more like the numerous movies of the produced through the '70s, '80s and '90s about a group of people picked off one by one by unseen creatures lurking in the dark. In the '70s, they were natural animals like sharks, killer whales, reptiles, furry animals and insects. In the '80s they were space aliens and robots. In the '90s they were super assassins. Lately they are vampires and zombies. Now we are back to furry animals. But the overall theme is the same. It is refreshing to see this theme played out in the Alaskan wilderness rather than on a space ship or an underground city overrun by zombies. In that sense, this movie is realistic. .

118,anselmdaniel,A brutal survival movie,8,20 April 2019,"This review contains spoilers.The Grey is a survival movie that premiered in 2011. The movie stars Liam Neeson in the starring role. The movie is directed by Joe Carnahan is based on the short story ""Ghost Walker"" by Ian Mackenzie Jeffers. The movie is about a downed plane that becomes beset by a pack of wolves.The Grey is a substantial deviation from what was shown in the trailers. The movie is a slow and more methodical view into a group of men in their last moments. The movie dives deeply into Liam Neeson's character of John Ottway. The movie fixates much of the 117 minutes of running time on John Ottway. This is an absolutely slow movie with much of the movie devoted to John Ottway's history. Anyone that was expecting a movie that was action packed like Neeson's movie of Taken will be disappointed. This movie was never about the action. The movie was only about the character and what they do in a purgatory like situation.This is a beautiful movie. The Alaskan wilderness feels like a distinct character in this movie. The utter cold and brutality of the wilderness is reflected well in this movie. It really did feel that the characters had to contend with an additional problem that is the harsh wilderness.The acting in this movie is top notch. Liam Neeson in the leading role of John Ottway knocks it out of the park. I could not find any weak links in actors in this movie. Everyone had done their job admirably. The acting is absolutely one of the bright spots in this movie.I would recommend 'The Grey.' This is a great character focused movie that is in a survival setting. I would advise anyone that is looking for an action movie to look elsewhere.Grade: B",The Grey
119,griffolyon12,An Impressive Feat from Carnahan,9,3 December 2012,"There are few movies that I'd say are purely for guys, and The Grey is one of them. Directed by Joe Carnahan, The Grey is a tense survival tale, and a contemplative piece about the fear and certainty of death. When a plane carrying oil riggers crashes in the snowy Alaskan wilderness, they are isolated with no sign of help, and are being hunted by wolves. Their only hope for survival is a wolf hunter, played by Liam Neeson.Chalk this one up as another Liam Neeson-starrer where he plays the awesome middle aged man with mean skills and superb attitude. While not a write home performance, Neeson, and the rest of the cast, for that matter, all do their jobs admirably. While the script is nimble, often not fleshing out the supporting characters beyond stock facades, The Grey is really about one thing, Liam Neeson, killing wolves, and survival. The tale is so harrowing, so tense, so gripping, you cannot turn your eyes away. Even in the quiet moments, you are tense, because you do not know how far behind the wolves are, this is a testament to the superb direction from Carnahan, who is proving himself to be one of the better directors of his generation.I give The Grey a 9 out of 10!",The Grey
120,mahmus,It's really damn good.,7,15 May 2020,"A lot more emotional and depressing than I think most of us expected.Liam Neeson is absolutely amazing.It probably deserves a higher rating, but I'm holding back because there are some problems I have with this movie, although it has never really kept me from loving it, but it might to someone else.",The Grey
121,RossRivero99,A Great survival tale,9,14 February 2014,"This movie kept me in my seat from start to finish because of what a great movie it really was. In my opinion i think that Liam Neeson was a great choice to play the main character, also featuring terrific action sequences with the all of the bloody battles between man vs. wolf.Which is well done but one flaw. But I will not recommend this movie for young movie watchers.The film has very good performances as well including Liam Neeson who does a good job in all of the movies in his films,Not in my top 10 movies of 2012 but certainly a very very good action movie. Director Joe Carnahan really knows what he is doing behind the camera which is why so far every movie i watched that he directed were very good movies. So far this is my 2nnd favorite film out of all of the survival movies that were ever put on film.",The Grey
122,DogePelis2015,White Hell,7,12 October 2021,"It is a very tense and exciting movie; the plot is good, the action scenes are excellent, and Liam Neeson's acting is sublime; it is highly recommended.",The Grey
123,Laakbaar,Tale of survival,9,21 April 2012,"Ottway (played brilliantly by Liam Neeson) is a marksmen hired by an oil company to protect a northern camp from the predatory wolves who prowl the perimeter. He's a level-headed, survivalist sort of fellow, although he's struggling with his own demons. He's the sort of man other men naturally gravitate to because he knows things. He understands wolves.He boards a flight that has a horrifying crash, which is realistically portrayed in the film. He and a handful of the other survivors find themselves in the utter wilderness in the middle of winter. And there are wolves. Huge terrifying wolves. Ottway, who is in his element and has emerged as a natural leader, realises they will not survive if they stay by the wreckage, so they go off on a gruelling march to seek protection and find their way home. The rest of the movie tells the story of their battle against the elements, especially the wolves, during their attempt to find rescue.I enjoyed this gripping movie immensely. Perhaps that's partly because I'm familiar with this kind of environment and could identify with the characters. This is very much a ""guy"" movie, a movie about dealing with challenges, finding your inner strength, coping physically and mentally in the face of extreme adversity and harsh conditions.No movie is 100% realistic. In particular, these wolves were imbued with unusual size, menace and malevolence. These were really frightening movie wolves, not real wolves. You don't expect to see this nowadays in a film. Wolves are our friends.Highly recommended.",The Grey
124,nicholls_les,Awful,1,7 April 2014,"Most of what has been said in criticising this film I would echo.The wolf behaviour depicted in this movie is ridiculous but it is the way the survivors act that is most stupid. They leave the wreckage of a massive plane that could be spotted from the air to walk into the wilderness in sub-zero temperatures and take very little from the plane that they could use to help them have a better chance to survive.As the film progresses ( if you can stay awake ) it gets increasingly stupid. I was watching this on TV and switched channels several times but kept looking back in case it improved. As I had watched so much I wanted to see how it ended and that was the biggest disappointment of all. The scene where they get off the cliff with a seemingly endless supply of cloth that they made a rope out of (where did it come from?) is just the stupidest decision ever. Then the guy who just gives up and wants to be left to die makes no sense at all. He didn't seem that bad and no way would the other men have left him. Two men tired from days walking out run a pack of wolves one falls into a river and gets his foot trapped and Liam jumps in and doesn't realise the guy is trapped even though it is plainly obvious. Then he manages to carry on walking with soaking wet clothes which would have been certain death. He somehow still has a couple of back packs on him which would have meant that either the contents which would have meant he went into the water with them in which case everything would be wet including the letter he found or he would have had to hike back up stream for some time to get them. Then he finds himself in the Wolves den. These are the same wolves that apparently trekked to where the plane crashed for some reason and the men somehow walk right to where the wolves came from? The Liam faces the alpha wolf and tapes broken bottles to his hands, rather than pick up one of the many sharp bones that were laying around and would have made better weapons. And then ... The film ends! I only kept watching this tripe to see how it ended and basically it doesn't end.",The Grey
125,doctorsmoothlove,The Grey,6,30 April 2012,"Liam Neeson is a movie star in the classical way we think about our culture's fascination with actors from the past. People are drawn to his films because of his debonair self-assuredness, an authoritative yet subdued masculinity. Since Darkman, his boyish good looks have become a reassuring presence to audiences searching for genre pictures. Look no further than the promotional material for The Grey. Neeson's face in climbing gear covers the whole poster and all the trailer reveals is that he fights a bunch of wolves.The movie has been improperly advertised either because of its star or, more likely, the distributors didn't think the public would want to see it without him. The trailer may mislead viewers into thinking this is some kind of actiony, quasi-horror movie. It's not. The movie is actually a survival drama that manifests itself occasionally like a Cormac McCarthy novel.A few of the men survive the opening plane crash, and all but one dies on screen. The ambiguous ending actually resulted in impassioned grumbling in the screening I attended. People at least wanted to see if Neeson could actually get out of the wolf's den. Instead, we see him prepare for a final, would-be-clichéd confrontation that never happens. That's a recurring thematic argument the movie makes with us. It wins more than it loses, and this makes its central oafish failure all the more jarring.Director/Writer Joe Carnahan should have been less aware his lead's audience appeal when composing this picture and blended him into it. Neeson's starpower places him outside of the rest of the movie. We know he is the most likely survivor as soon as we see the poster. Well, nothing could have been done about that. Fledgling distributor Open Road Films is too small to survive a flop. But that handicap is exacerbated due to some of the most worthless flashbacks of any movie this year. The struggle for survival is often interrupted with pedantic daydreams of silken bedrooms showered in gentle light nestled with lovely wives. Only the main character is entitled to his own scenes like this. The rest of the cast share very man-to-man exchanges around the campfire that emotionally distinguish each member of the group. Their deaths become the lines of a sorrowful rondel, with an inevitable conclusion that we don't even need to see. The repetitive proceeding is also disguised by intimate, hand-held camera-work. It binds us to the main character particularly during the opening scenes when we think a plane crash is the worst thing he will experience.It's worth mentioning that The Grey cost only $25 million to produce. New Moon was twice as expensive and has the same bad CG wolves that you see here. The real difference being that this film has to have wolves (plot progression) in it whereas the other only has them because the filmmakers think modern special effects allow them to be there. New Moon and its progeny would have looked just as artificial had they been made with stop-motion while no one notices The Grey no matter what year it is released.",The Grey
126,TheSquiss,I'm not hiking in the Alaskan woods unless I have some pretty serious artillery!,8,16 June 2012,"I'm not hiking in the Alaskan woods unless I have some pretty serious artillery just like I'm never swimming off the coast of South Africa. The Grey does for wolves what Jaws did for sharks. If you want cuddly wolves, read Nicholas Evans' (he of The Horse Whisperer fame) The Loop. If you want to experience the wrong end of canine incisors without actually being mauled this should be top of your list.The Grey is another film from the Scott Free stable owned by Ridley & Tony Scott. Add director Joe Carnahan (Narc, Smokin' Aces, The A-Team) to the mix and you can expect not only great pedigree but also a flick with depth, action and a few heart-stopping moments.An Alaskan oil drilling team attempts to fly home in the worst kind of plane to avoid the worst kind of winter and experiences the worst kind of turbulence. As on-screen plane crashes go, this exceeds that of Alive and Fearless. It's shocking and there's no escaping the reality that it's not going to end well for most of the passengers. As bodies and semi-conscious survivors litter the snow, Ottway (Liam Neeson in another strong, stoic performance), rouses himself to the reality of impending death from the cold and the gathering pack of wolves. Leaving the dead out for the wolves to lunch upon isn't an option. These wolves aren't hungry, they just want to kill.The initial trailer didn't excite me. Man against wolf for two hours isn't worthy of my time or money but this isn't your standard offering from Hollywood. I'm not telling you if it all works out but it certainly isn't all nicey-nicey with a bunch of gung-ho heroes who make traps and find warm hunting lodges in which to take refuge. Carnahan makes it clear from the outset the wolves have the upper hand and God is busy listening to those praying in warmer climes.Neeson is on better, brooding form than in Taken and his character doesn't care whether you like him or not. The supporting cast serves to make Neeson stand out but each of them has a third dimension and there is a frightening reality to their terror and how they deal with it.There are a couple of early Harry Potter moments with the animatronics but for the most part the wolves are convincing and The Grey takes the Jaws approach of less is more. It's more frightening when you can't see the beast that's going to kill you. There's a standout moment where the dwindling band of bedraggled survivors can hear the wolves on the ridge but the only physical evidence is a row of warm breath geysers exhaled into the frigid air.Carnahan takes time to paint death across a canvas of exquisite beauty. The scenery is breathtaking and, vindictive wolves aside, it must be a phenomenal landscape to experience. As one of the men comments, there are worse places to die.",The Grey
127,harryplinkett14,Needed rewriting,4,10 November 2012,"The film can't seem to decide whether it wants to concentrate on the human drama or the battle with the wolves. In the end it fails on both counts. The characters are too thin and for the most part whenever we hear the dramatic piano music and see those flashbacks and overexposed images we can't help but feel manipulated into feeling something that isn't really there. Apart from that the script is pretty straightforward: Meaningless squabbles. Check. Someone acting like an idiot for no reason and bringing everyone in danger. Check. Jump off a cliff. Check. Fall into a river. Check. Getting one's limbs injured and having to be left behind. Check.Actually the only thing missing is the obligatory ""plane flies by but they can't get the pilot's attention"" bit.What else can I say? The wolves look ridiculous. Awful CGI that shatters the illusion of reality. On a positive note Liam Neeson manages to carry the film alone on his back and make it look decent.Final verdict: Too many characters and poorly used wolves. The script needed a rewrite and I would personally reduce the number of characters to two or three so we could really get to know them and develop a dynamic between them. Also, with CGI that bad they should have turned the wolves into more of a looming threat and avoided those awful closeups.",The Grey

It is these parts that get sidetracked and over to a more philosophic road, though it is very vivid and good parts of the movie it wasn't at all what I expected. would have had 4 more men survived and use their extra stories and make it all action and high impact :)This is kind of a gloomy film, but it delivers a good story, is entertaining and worth a watch, but maybe be ready to see something more happy afterward.",The Grey
130,richieandsam,A great movie that was very intense.,7,22 July 2014,"THE GREYI didn't know anything about this film really... all i did know was Liam Neeson was in it.The movie is about a group of people who survive a major plane crash, but when they try and get back to civilisation, they get hunted by a pack of hungry wolves.The story is actually a little depressing. The things these guys have to go through are really bad and hard to imagine surviving. You really feel sorry for these guys, but there are times where they react to some thing in a certain way that just didn't feel right. There are a couple of times where they start joking and laughing together, and I know you would have to try and find a way out of the situation, but I am not sure that anyone would have been able to laugh like that under that pressure.The story was really good and well put together. There is a lot of dialogue in this movie which is a nice touch. It was written very well.The acting was very good. Everyone was believable and there were characters that you liked and other characters that you really didn't like. But you still felt sorry for all of them. Liam Neeson was the main character, but other cast members were Frank Grillo, Dermot Mulroney, Dallas Roberts and Joe Anderson.The wolves were actually quite scary. I liked the way that they looked and the way they acted around the humans. The only thing I was not very convinced about was their knowledge. The wolves in this movie were very smart. They seemed to understand and communicate a plan to get the humans. I just think that they would have been more 'wild' about it and less smart.There is a very good ending to this movie and not very predictable at all...

131,willcundallreview,A survival with a lot of thought put in,7,9 June 2014,"The Grey is a fast paced survival thriller that surprisingly provides a philosophical meaning to it's core. Big acting from Liam Neeson he is yet again the leading man and with a cast around him that do an OK job too, this isn't done badly at all. It has it's boring moments of course and also some truly thrilling parts which may just get you to be on the edge of your seat. I felt that this movie was just about pretty good, and here below is why I think so.The story straight away jumps out ""Wolves in a survival thriller"", yes it may seem like this will just be Neeson killing Wolves constantly over and over, it actually isn't just that, It has pieces of long dialogue(which sometimes over do themselves so it gets repetitive), but in any way it is surprising to see. It doesn't disappoint on the action, it has quite a bit and it provides some ingenuity from Neeson and his crew of survivors, but don't expect this to be over the top violence, it is pretty well done.Neeson is good enough for this type of movie, we have seen him like this many times before(even the tone of voice he uses), but hey a good performance anyway and when it really mattered he delivered. The poor thing with the cast was that Neeson is the head honcho and the rest are just too unknown and so you only feel Neeson is an important character, but then with the support we get to know their back story, even though they are not central characters, wasted time.The script is good to say you expect violence more than talking, it delivers some good lines from everyone and Neeson gets to say some pretty thought provoking lines as well. It is directed well by Joe Carnahan who really seems to be able to delve into this survival film, and really bring out the best bits, his vision you feel probably went the way he wanted it too. The setting can be very dull after a while as it is snow constantly, obviously not enough to call it a bad movie but it can surely make you dizzy.I think the main criticism for me was that it is just too predictable to be a GREAT movie, pretty good yes but not a film that is challenging for awards. It's predictable because you just know the way this film is going to go, I won't ruin it for anyone but you get the point of how it is going to end, and then with Neeson you just see how much of a main character he is. It doesn't deliver it's religious message very well either, they try to get Neeson to call on god(with no reply), but is just makes the scene cringe worthy.People will definitely like this, it boasts a good actor in a role he knows well or should I say can do well in. It as the right balance of action and dialogue to set up a film that never quite loses it's pace at any moment, it just chills along, so survival film fans should really like this because of that. If you particularly like animals and hate there deaths, I'd stay away as many wolves are killed, injured and even on one occasion eaten, so this one is not for people who love animals(especially wolves).Overall it is Just About Kind of Good, not near being straight good, but beats being just another OK movie. Try not to expect what your thinking it will be like and you will be surprised how much you actually might like it, it has a lot to offer, not always showing that and can be bumpy if not very bumpy towards the end. In the end it turns out pretty good, I would recommend it, if not only to see Liam Neeson take on a action type role yet again, and do it with style.",The Grey
132,Just-A-Girl-14,BIG MEH...,6,11 July 2020,"I absolutely love survival movies but this one is not so good! Many of the scenes are somewhere between unlikely and never gonna happened. I couldn't care less about the characters. Frankly, I was rooting for the wolves. They should have killed them all much sooner. Sorry but let's be real, people cannot outrun wolves. It's just the reality of the situation. Plus, judging by their size and quantity the movie should have ended after 45 minutes max. The behaviour of both people and wolves didn't make much sense. Why would they leave the plane if they don't know where they are going? They should have barricaded themselves inside the plane and wait for help. Also, it was really ""nice"" of the Alpha to give Liam Neeson the time to arm himself. It watchable but it's mostly boring and ridiculous. Maybe the short story it is based on is better. I can't say cause I never read it but I feel like they were trying to be poetic and they really missed the mark. Just a big meh in my opinion.",The Grey
133,josh_lambert1991,Middle of the park movie,6,25 January 2019,I think your enjoyment of this movie will depend on what you are expecting to get out of it. Liam Neeson is a solid leading man in this film but the overall story does fall a bit flat in places.,The Grey
134,stevenrotherforth,One of Neeson's best,8,21 January 2020,"The GreyDirected by Joe Carnahan, starring Liam Neeson, Frank Grillo and Dermot Mulroney 'The Grey' tells the story of six oil workers who's plane crashes in the Alaskan wilderness.
Unfortunately for the unlucky survivors they crash in the middle of the territory of a pack of ravenous wolves.
These rather nasty canines aren't too pleased about the intruders.
One by one they hunt the men down.Carnahan's film is masterfully staged. A bleak and depressing movie about a bunch of broken men. Each having their own personal pain to deal with.
When I say 'depressing' this tone is intentional by the director so we the audience learn just how much one is willing to fight for survival.
Even when those onscreen in many ways have given up on life.
Performances by all are superb. Grillo and Neeson being the standouts.
But perhaps it is the Alaskan wilderness that is the real star of the show.
It's true power steals every scene. Carnahan does an epic job of conveying the dangerous environment with some fine cinematography and clever choices regarding image quality.Then there's the wolves.
The director smartly never fully reveals the ferocious beasts until the very end.
Instead Carnahan takes note from Spielberg's movie 'Jaws' by only showing glimpses of the vicious animals.
One particular scene at night when the men are approached by the pack.
The inky blackeness of the night is illuminated by a single fiery torch.
The wolves eyes reflect the light glowing menacingly in the darkness.
This is a rather frightening and effective shot.
I believe much of the hiding of the animals came down to budget constraints.
Some of the close up attacks looked a little suspect and it was obvious to see that the wolves were just puppets.Visually Carnahan's film is a mixed bag in terms of image quality. Yet again I think this was intentional by the director and it works wonderfully.
Some scenes are crisp with detail. Mainly facial closeup scenes. But for the most part 'The Grey' has a soft cinematic appearance. One that looks like it's been made for a projector.
The soft/bleak image quality heightens the sense of disparity.
In Hi-Def sometimes specular highlights become blown out. Particularly fallen snow which would lose detail and become just a white mass.
Also scenes with fire would have no graduation to the colours of the flame.
Contrast is turned up to eleven!
I think the director did this to create a stark visual effect elevating the harsh environment.
Depth sometimes looks stunning with falling snowflakes adding dimension to the image.
Then in some wide shots of landscapes the image would look like a soft confusing blurry mess.
Yet again perhaps this was to convey the helplessness of the characters onscreen.
'The Grey' is a film with a lot of grain but the softness of the overall picture would counteract this. Shadow detail is never lost and the night time scenes are among the best.
I viewed this film on an OLED screen and the contrast of burning flames against pitch black darkness was truly captivating.
All in all this 1080p transfer for the most part does look splendid.Audio quality is perhaps this movies stronger technical aspect.
I listened to this movie with a Dolby Digital Plus mix.
Low frequency effects were adequate. The plane crash being the stand out.
It is the movies excellent soundstage and surround effects that are the wolves nuts.
This sound mix is truly immersive. The haunting sound of howling wolves can be heard all around and the vicious wind whips across your listening environment with awe inspiring realism.
This is a movie that howls out for a Dolby Atmos/DTS X upgrade.
The standard 5.1 sound is good but an object based mix with a little more low end oomph would really elevate the aural experience.'The Grey' was one of Neeson's immediate post 'Taken' offerings. A film that was made at the height of his renaissance.
In my opinion, one of his very best.",The Grey
135,LloydBayer,Joe Carnahan and Liam Neeson gives a new twist to survival horror.,7,18 February 2012,"Having made a grand entrance with the likes of ""Smokin' Aces"" and the rehashed ""A-Team"", there was a lot riding on writer-director Joe Carnahan's method of fusing style and mood in action movies. Having Liam Neeson in the lead only adds to that expectation. For the most part, Carnahan gets it right, yet somehow, I can't help feeling that something is missing. Either that, or there are too many things at play here, because this is not your run-off-the-mill action/adventure movie.As John Ottway, Neeson's character is full of ironies, most of which revolve around the fact that death comes to us all. In portraying that, Ottway is a man that sees things as they are, and is very straight forward in understanding and interpreting the laws of nature. With this mindset, Ottway assumes leadership among a group of air crash survivors. Contracted to protect Alaskan oil rig workers from wolf attacks, Ottway now finds himself and a small group of survivors in the middle of nowhere. Braving the bitter cold, finding food and shelter and being rescued is challenging as it is. Being stalked and killed by a pack of wolves becomes Ottway's biggest irony when the group learns that their predators are closing in. As each man becomes a mutilated victim, it dawns on the rest that these wolves have a shocking reason for hunting these men.In his screenplay and directional approach, Carnahan's reveal on why these survivors are hunted by wolves is pure ingenuity. This is where the audience is hit in the face with the film's paradox. While the tagline, pre-release trailers, and intended genre will fool you into expecting this to be another intense Liam Neeson action flick, let me just say that Carnahan has evidently had other things in mind– right from the start. Sure, watching defenseless men trying to survive against extreme weather, an unforgiving wilderness and merciless wolves is an intense cinematic experience; I promise you that. However, Carnahan's forte is in breaking the spirit and psyche of hardened men. This is nicely done when Todd, Talget, Hendrik, Burke, Hernandez and Diaz, each in their own doomed way, prove that human beings are nothing but a miniscule blotch on the grand canvas of creation. Arriving at this juncture, the film's philosophy takes a detour from the main artery of thought flow and reaches a fork in the road. It is this sub-plot that I thought was unnecessary, where the occasional focus on Ottway's emotional past gets to become frequent. I found that this is neither relevant nor does it add anything extra to the plot. This is a definite setback in my opinion, but bouncing back, Carnahan's intended atmosphere speaks for itself. There is lurking doom, escalating tension and a frightening pause in many scenes when an attack is immanent. This atmosphere is captured so well that I found myself loosing any hope of these characters surviving.Neeson is always great to watch as one of those rare actors to permeate brute strength in his roles. That said, Neeson delivers as expected but gives a fresh look to survival horror even though this movie is not perceived as a horror flick. Nice to see him successfully attempt a role outside his norm. Most of the supporting cast are little known actors that are nevertheless convincing, at least for those few seconds before being consumed by the jaws of death. Frank Grillo as Diaz, and Dallas Roberts as Hendrick, standout amongst the rest in adding depth to their characters and the significance of these characters in the story.At the time of watching this movie, I had my reservations about the ill-received abrupt ending. Reflecting on it now, I realize there was never meant to be an ending in the conventional sense. Carnahan's final cut leaves the ending to the viewer's imagination. However, considering the film's philosophical approach, I felt the ending is a battle for supremacy between science and religion. While we require both beliefs to preserve cosmic stability, I couldn't help but feel a perceived inclination towards the scientific theory that the stronger species is always destined to survive. Now, the true essence of the film is in interpreting unwritten laws of nature, or in this context, when, where and how one species has the right to dominate another.I recommend giving this film a try just for experiencing its scary atmosphere and the horrific feeling of misery that comes with it. If you understand and appreciate it's hard to ignore messages, then you are likely to enjoy this film entirely.",The Grey
136,Lebowskidoo,The Undisputed Alpha of Wolf Movies,10,20 February 2021,"""Don't move! Stare right back at them!""The Grey is difficult to describe. It's a violent action-thriller-adventure story, but it's also a somber, reflective look at a life lived through a philosophical lens that adds way more depth than you'd expect.A neverending gritty sense of some terrible fate hangs over this story from the start and it never relents. This is not your friendly neighborhood Disney wolf story, these animals are out to secure their place in the wilderness hierarchy and if you happen to be in the way, well, sucks to be you. Each character is given some semblance of a personality and is not simply another victim. The fact that these characters confront head-on the reality of the situation with logic and facts, and let's face it, utter dread, makes it stand out from so many action movies where everyone is invincible. Diaz (the awesome Frank Grillo) is an acknowledgement of such a stereotype. At first he's all, "" I don't walk through this world with fear in my heart,"" but then in the next moment he's terrified. Putting on a brave face won't help, the wolves don't care.I have a theory that everyone simply died in the plane crash and the rest with the wolves is John Ottway's own guilt over killing wolves and dealing with his father issues in the afterlife. It's one way to look at it.The character of John Ottway closely mirrors Liam Neeson himself in that they both recently lost their wives and are searching for meaning in their lives now. Makes me wonder if this played a part in Neeson choosing this role. If you think of this as an allegory for Neeson's own experiences, it feels deeper, but then you wind up feeling guilty for doing so.The Grey reaches beyond any initial expectations of what looks from the outside like a man vs. nature survival movie. It challenges your own beliefs and suggests other ideas you might not have considered. The Grey manages to seep into your very soul and squeeze it. A mere movie that can do that is not to be ignored. This was so powerful the first time I watched it, and still is now, after my third time. I couldn't believe that it was mostly overlooked by so many as ""that killer wolf movie"" when it offers so much more. In time, people will discover this for what it is: An epic tale of the will to survive packaged in metaphor and layered in substance and humanity.""Once more into the fray.

137,p-jonsson,Unrealistic and stupid,4,11 July 2012,"I am amazed by how many people on IMDb that have given this movie 8, 9 and even 10 stars. It's perhaps not the worst movie I've seen but it is in no way worth that kind of rating.The good part of the movie is Liam Neeson who makes an enjoyable performance with the script that he was given. He is pretty much the reason that I gave it as much as 4 IMDb stars. The rest of the film is just plain wrong.My first impression is, god this director likes film grain! Now this is a matter of taste of course but I don't like when movies have artificially been made to look like they were filmed on old and crappy film. It has its places but it didn't add anything here.The film starts off with a plane crash which is not done very good. Neither in terms of special effects nor in terms of realism.The lack of realism, unfortunately, continues throughout the movie. The behavior of the wolves is utterly unnatural and unrealistic. I can live with this if it's a horror movie or some other fantasy movie but this is not supposed to be that. The actual footage of the wolves is rather mediocre as well.Then there is this so called experienced hunter and ""wolf expert"". Leaving the crash site is a dubious decision to say the least. Then we got the jumping of cliffs with a flimsy home rope instead of just walking a bit further to get down not to mention making ammunition go off by poking wooden sticks at it, what the f? In addition the guy knows nothing about wolves, or any other wild animal for that matter.Just to add to this not so enjoyable experience, the film has an utterly lousy ending.",The Grey

139,rooee,Into the wild,7,2 February 2012,"Hats off to Joe Carnahan for following up the breezy, barmy A-Team with a return to the grit and grime (and grey) of 2002's Narc. His latest – a survival-movie-cum-existential-drama – is so confident and sincere that one is almost convinced that one is watching something new. This is unashamedly a genre picture that hits familiar notes, but one that carries an unusual emotional gravity and psychological conviction normally eschewed in favour of action set-pieces.Following a plane crash in the Alaskan nowhere, stalked by intelligent super-wolves, Liam Neeson's John Ottway leads a gaggle of broken souls out of the wreckage and into oblivion. Amongst the scowls and growls there are moments of genuine profundity; not least a quiet riverside death scene delivering a powerful philosophical dilemma, encapsulating the mournful rationality of self-determination.The effectiveness of the survival thriller depends in large part on whether the supporting cast - who will inevitably be picked off in various imaginative ways - are mere dog fodder or develop as memorable characters in their own right. Thankfully, the latter is largely the case here, with backstories gradually coming into view through fireside anecdotes rather than cheesy deathbed exposition. It's all building toward an excellent climactic scene in which the flame of each character briefly flickers back to life through a series of crumpled photographs: a simple, poignant scene representative of the thoughtful screenplay.Neeson, whose post-Star Wars emergence as a middle-aged action star has left him looking occasionally indifferent, is on top form. When he looks into the tundra sky and cries out to the Maker, this guy really means it. The poem he repeats throughout might not up to much, but Neeson delivers it in such a way that its personal resonance overpowers its contrived relevance. For me, this is the best ""big"" movie of 2012 so far.",The Grey

I also liked the cinematography, making full use of the scenery, but with some great close-up work as well.For a film set in the wilderness it, surprisingly, relied heavily on the dialogue between the various characters. Some of which was very well written and well delivered; I just felt the pictures could have told more of the story.

141,ericrnolan,"For a few reasons, I'm finding ""The Grey"" (2012) a difficult movie to review.",8,1 November 2014,"For one, I think it's a little hard to do without spoilers – especially with respect to the fact that this movie is absolutely NOT what viewers are expecting. For another, this appears to be a very thoughtful movie, and I'm pretty sure I didn't understand it as well as other viewers. Finally, certain aspects of this movie really are just a matter of taste, and what some viewers like, others will abhor – especially the ending.It was very good – I'll tell you that much. I'd give it 8 out of 10.If you read reviews of ""The Grey"" online – which I'd advise you not to do because of spoilers – you can see that many people are downright angry about this movie. There's a good reason for that. This film's marketers absolutely did mislead audiences with its trailer – especially with one climactic scene that DOES NOT APPEAR IN THE MOVIE.This isn't an action-adventure movie at all. We really don't see ""Liam Neeson kick ass."" Nor is it a survival horror movie. You could describe it as a thriller, but it's actually very slow in some places, and has offers no ""payoff"" or climax. I think it's an existential drama, and it's heavy with symbolism. An online review from The Guardian informs me that the wolves are a metaphor for death, and I'm embarrassed to admit I never picked up on that. I thought they were an arbitrary plot device set up to explore the characters' coping abilities. Maybe they were that too?This film is very dark, and sometimes even depressing. I almost found it too much. That statement says a lot coming from me, because I've seen a lot of horror movies and war movies. When, near the end, my favorite character drowned in a particularly frustrating way, I started to feel that the screenwriter simply wanted to depress me.I remain just a little confused about this movie's themes. I was surprised to learn that this was marketed as a movie with Christian messages. That befuddles me. Characters express faith and are not rewarded for it. Fate deals out miserable ends to good people. At one point, Liam Neeson literally curses God and appears to renounce his faith. Neeson's character does draw strength from his past experiences in order to fight and survive. But is this necessarily a Christian message? To me, that sounds like Freudian sublimation. There also appear to be some pretty questionable messages. Characters try their hardest and show character and courage – then fail. One character gives up entirely and resigns himself to certain death  and this choice seems to be represented quite favorably. Huh?Finally, the ending is extremely ambiguous and open-ended. You really don't find out ""what happens at the end."" You don't. Many people don't know that there is a ""cookie,"" or post-credits sequence, in which we see more of the final scene. But this sequence is also ambiguous, and offers no clear ending to the story.With all of that said, I actually would recommend this. It just happens to be a very well made movie. The directing was generally good. (This is despite the fact that I think we see way too little of the wolves; I'm the type of guy who actually wants to ""see the monster"" and not have all of it left to my imagination.) There's one scene in which one character sees another after falling from a tree that is rendered just beautifully. (You kind of have to see it to get what I'm talking about.)The characters and dialogue are extremely well written. To a man, the acting is top-notch. Liam Neeson is fantastic. And yet even he is nearly upstaged by Dallas Roberts, whose performance in a supporting role was flawless.Even the sound effects and editing were great. Among many other things, the sounds of the animals were superbly rendered. At one point, the roar of the ""alpha wolf"" sounds like a@#$% tiger, and it scares the *&^% at of you at a key moment.If anyone really liked this movie, as I did, there are two even better movies that incorporate similar settings and plots. The first is ""The Edge"" (1997), which parallels this movie perfectly and is much more satisfying. The second is the incredibly underrated ""Frozen"" (2010), which is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. There are also two famous short stories that have a lot in common with this movie: Jack London's ""To Build a Fire,"" and Saki's ""The Interlopers.""All in all, this was a well made film, but it still might disappoint those who were expecting something else.http://ericrobertnolan.wordpress.com/",The Grey
142,buckikris,Liam Neeson Goes Into The Fray In The Grey,8,12 June 2014,"I bought this movie for a penny on Amazon and could not pass up a great deal. The first time I watched it I rented it on DVD, I had a negative view if it somewhat. I bought it and watched it again last night, I had a more positive view of it this time. After the death of his wife Ottway(Neeson) wonders where he should go on living or not. To me he is an oil driller who hates his job; because of some of the people he is associated with, for example ex cons. He along with a plane full of other roughnecks are preparing for their next assignment. It is awful outside, the ground crew is deicing the plane, among other preparations so it will be able to take off safely. Once they are in flight the plane sounds like it is going though rough turbulence but it keeps getting worse. The next thing you know the plane is breaking apart and it crashes in a desolate part of the Alaskan wilderness. The wreckage is everywhere, and once Ottway comes to he starts to search for the survivors. He works his way back to the main fuselage that's still intact and finds 7 survivors. They must stick together use their survivor skills in order to survive the cold vast wilderness. Once they begin their trek, little do they know they are being hunted buy a pack of wolves. They each take two hour shifts while the others sleep, they stay close together each night at their camp, and make sure they build fires to keep the wolves at bay. The survivors then become targets, getting picked off one by one. One of the men, Burke suffers Hypoxia and the next morning Ottway tries to wake him/revive him, and can't. Burke either froze to death or succumbed to his hypoxia. Then the remain survivors come to a river, Hendricks gets swept down a river, and gets his foot caught in between two rocks. Even though Ottway tries to save him, Hendrick eventually drowns. This movie is not for everybody, I liked it because I love the outdoors and I am a HUGH NEESON FAN. I probably would have given the movie an 8, but the use of the F word was a little much. I don't care about hearing cuss words we all do it, but the last time I heard that word that much was in Harlem Nights. I wonder why there are negative reviews concerning this movie? It does start out slow and the ending could have been better; but once the action starts the viewer is in for a non-stop thrill ride.THX, Kris L. CocKayne",The Grey

Liam Neeson stars as Ottway, a member of an oil-drilling team, with a knowledge for killing wolves in Alaska, and a heartbreaking past. While he and his fellow members are on a plane back home, the plane suddenly crashes into the remote Alaskan wilderness. Now, it's up to Ottway and the six remaining survivors, to head back to civilization, while trying to survive from not just harsh weather conditions, but from a pack of vicious wolves. If you're looking for a movie that will leave your adrenaline pumping, expectations rising, and excitement up to a full level, ""The Grey"" is just the movie for you. It's the definition of a totally entertaining popcorn movie. All you need is a stellar performance from Liam Neeson, a great direction, some fantastic shots of Alaska, some realistic and authentic wolf attack scenes, and some of the strongest action scenes ever put on screen, to make such an entertaining movie. Liam Neeson delivers one of the best performances of his entire career, delivering such a strong heart to the character, and brought a great touch to his ""bad-assedry"". It's ""movie heaven"" to watch Liam Neeson on screen in this movie. I smell ""trophy-worthy""! Writer-director Joe Carnahan perfectly directs this movie, giving it such a unique and thrilling touch. The cinematography is breathtaking, the action is ""edge of your seat"" thrilling, and the wolf attacks is terrifically realistic, it's like making the audience jump from one scene to another. From the opening credits to the final shot, ""The Grey"" is an exciting adventure, from one flawless moment to the next. But there are some moments when this movie loses it's excitement for quite a while, when it jumps to scenes where it might get a little un-meaningful, although not technically boring. Yet, the pacing sadly has a tough understanding on whether it wants to be quick or dragging. But at it's intense and suspenseful moments, even at it's emotional conversational scenes, the movie will easily pick up there. After 118 minutes of terrific entertainment, peppered with meaningful characters, a great premise, and fantastically made action scenes, this movie caps off with one of the most talked-about endings ever put to film, that's both heartwarming, and thrilling. Make sure to wait for a post-credits scene at the end, that will definitely ask a lot of burning questions. Exciting and thought-provoking in every sense possible, ""The Grey"" is one of 2012's better films, even at it's noticeable flaws.

144,Ramascreen,Liam Neeson Vs. Wolves,8,28 January 2012,"-- www.Ramascreen.com --At times it feels like a long episode of Man Vs. Wild but the film's occasional detour to drama about mortality and faith and questions about what happens when you die while trying to survive through dangerous elements keeps me fixed on THE GREY. Liam Neeson is the man, it doesn't get more macho than Neeson, he can track down and fight human traffickers and now he can fight wolves, that is one bloody ballsy Irish son of a gunThe film is set in an extremely harsh cold condition which is great to me, it adds the level of complication because if the wolves don't mess with the characters, the weather will, the cliffs will or the raging river will, this is an environment where literally anything goes. I think the film's pacing is great, the story puts good care for the characters, it starts out with Neeson's character losing hope on life, but then he finds himself with a purpose to fight again. If you watch the previews or the trailers, you'd probably immediately dismiss it as some kind of action horror film but it's actually got heart and it's surprisingly emotional on some parts, you get to see a depiction of both the best and the worst of human nature when a few characters are put in a situation where they basically don't belong.I really admire what THE GREY did as far as the wolves go, they used a combination of both practical effects and CG and the wolves look amazing, very convincing, very menacing, the threat is constantly there. I'm glad almost nothing about this film seems toned down, the violence makes it all more real and suspenseful, if you can't stand the sight of blood, you're going to have a hard time watching because there's lots of it. Some of the knowledge about the wolves that you'll hear in the film may be a bit exaggerated and some of the actions taken by the characters may not go according to the usual survival tips but it's all designed to remind you again and again that the odds are not in their favor. I think the cinematography is fantastic, the turbulence and the plane crash sequence are massive and terrifying. I'm a big fan of Carnahan's gritty cop drama Narc and I think with THE GREY, Carnahan returns to that similar world where the lead character wonders if it's still all worth something, anything at all, what will fear turn you into and if there's a higher power that could help, THE GREY doesn't answer those questions, it merely shows the frustrations that come with them.-- www.Ramascreen.com --",The Grey

This movie is a little more like ""The Road"" in its storytelling. Very drawn out, not a lot of real good action other than people getting eaten by wolves one by one or dying in other ways. The movie definitely elicited a huge emotional response from me and I thought the ultimate message was a stirring one, to never give up even in the face of unquestionable failure. My main problem was that I was led to expect something that the movie was not and this by the people who were supposed to advertise the movie to me. Had I entered the movie expecting a tragic ending then I might have not minded it as much. Basically I'm led to believe that the main character (Neeson) at some point is going to start kicking some serious wolf butt and escape and survive. Instead, one by one each character dies and Neeson walks right into the wolf den and gets killed. I'd say this show is more like ""Deliverance"" meets ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"". Survival show with a pointlessly tragic ending.",The Grey

Nesson gives a commendable performance as Ottway the wolf killer. Even though we don't know either of them well enough for it to be really meaningful, the way his estranged wife acts as a guardian angel to him is an interesting device. Realistic oil roughneck acting and dialogue despite most of the supporting characters tending to run together and, plane crash notwithstanding, seldom completing a sentence without two or three f-bombs.This film is undeniably realistic in many ways; in many others, it's not. Mostly due to its fine camera work and stage directions, THE GREY is tense and compelling, but there are a number of annoying short-cuts and cop-outs. The best aspect of this film is the forbiddingly beautiful Alaskan scenery--the cinematography really outdoes the plot. I don't much care for the ending but have to say that it is both surprising and fitting for this film's whole Hemingwayesque tone and atmosphere (humankind versus the dispassionate wild and all that kind of stuff).

148,Chris_Pandolfi,Attack of the Killer Wolves!,4,27 January 2012,"""The Grey"" is a deplorable example of exploitation, cruelty, and nihilism masquerading as philosophy. Here is a ""survivalist"" story in which the survivors are given the same reverence as horror movie victims, who appear to have depth and yet are merely awaiting their turn to die on cue. Not merely die, but become playthings for ""nature,"" which in this case is about as unnatural as it gets. It's bad enough we have to endure a plane crash and several shots of bodies strewn throughout the wreckage; those that survived are left stranded in the frozen wilderness of an Alaskan forest, at which point they're each stalked by a pack of wolves. In a more thoughtful movie, the wolves would be depicted as products of their own environment, hunting only when necessary. Here, they're depicted as psychotic killing machines with borderline supernatural powers.To be sure, we also see examples of hypothermia, oxygen deprivation, drowning, and bleeding to death. But the wolves are the real culprits. They attack the human characters with little to no warning. In many cases, they pop out in sudden bursts, like skeletons in one of those cheap carnival funhouses you ride with on dates. Their intention, we're told, is not to eat but merely to kill. We know this not just because of how they tear their prey to shreds, but also because of numerous shots of them surrounding the characters. In one, several pairs of eyes appear out of the darkness and glow fiercely. In others, we see rows of them as they prowl low to the ground. Most of the time, we only hear them howl in horrifying unison. And to think director Joe Carnahan allowed just one shot of a full moon emerging from a veil of clouds. Too bad those three seconds were captured on a Queasy Cam.The humans are led by a man named Ottway (Liam Neeson), a wolf hunter for a petroleum company. He's established during opening sequences as deeply introspective in matters of death, in part because of memories of his dead wife, in part because of what he does for a living (for which he should be ashamed of himself). Mostly, though, it's because of a letter he's writing to no one, which is narrated for the benefit of the audience. This is followed shortly thereafter by a suicide attempt in which he puts the working end of his rifle in his mouth. I don't remember if he chickens out or is stopped, and to be perfectly honest, I don't really care. He and a group of laborers board a plane bound for Anchorage, only for the plane to crash dramatically. Out of all the survivors, he quickly appoints himself leader. They gather all the necessary supplies such as airplane fuel for making fires, but it seems he's more interested in what waits for them in the wilderness.He's a wolf whisperer, you see. He knows how wolves think, feel, and behave. And so he spends much of the film warning the survivors about them with the tact of a counselor telling a ghost story to frightened young campers. The survivors try to keep their wits about them. Little do they know that they're actually starring in a horror movie, and that in horror movies, there's usually a pecking order applied to the victims. Typically, they're stock characters with little to no depth. In this case, they're developed on emotionally manipulative conventions. One has a young daughter he would have loved to see again. Most have women or relatives they left behind. And then, of course, there's the one guy that questions the leader's authority and spends most of the film angrily rubbing everyone the wrong way. Here's one character that should be eaten by wolves just because it will finally shut him up.They're developed in other obvious ways, most notably by having discussions and debates on life, death, God, and the afterlife. This eventually leads to more personal admissions, including Ottway's description of his Irish father, who was a hard drinker and a bit of a poet. What I don't understand is why the filmmakers bothered to develop the characters at all, given the apparent pointlessness of their very being. The message, as I understand it, is that you shouldn't love or laugh or even live, because in the end, it's all going to be taken from you. Is there any particular reason why we should leave a movie feeling more hopeless than when we first entered? Why not consider the insane notion that life, though short, is beautiful and precious, and that, regardless of what does or does not exist spiritually, what we do while we're alive truly does matter?Alas, the filmmakers are much more interested in men being eaten by wolves. How pleasant. The film is based on the short story ""Ghost Walker"" by Ian MacKenzie Jeffers, and while I haven't read it, I have a sneaking suspicion that ""The Grey"" is remarkably faithful to it, if only because Jeffers gets half of the screenplay credit. How sad that he seems to place no value on humanity or nature. I cannot recall the last time I left a movie feeling so depressed, so defeated, so angry that it had to make a point about how there is no point to be made. I presume it will be warmly received by the horror and action aficionados, as it regularly delivers the cheap thrills. Those of you looking for something deeper may want to consider bringing along a box of tissues, a dose of an antidepressant, and the phone numbers of several well-respected therapists. Trust me, you're going to need them.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",The Grey

Then anyone in any incarceration facility regular, maximum security or psychiatric; all visits are recorded so the entire conversation between the spineless brothers including ""keep the baby and return to him"" is known. Her breakout with the suit flickering it's on all the surveillance. A proper crime scene job after knocking him off the ladder with paint would show you she's not insane.However without a picture of their three years I assume relationship/marriage Can't pick up an idea of how psychotic he was until her breakout from the hospital or killing her sister.Then to push it from Neutral to under 5 stars a plethora of hacks from other suspense films.

150,Thrashman88,No Win Scenario,7,26 February 2017,"I watched ""The Grey"" last night and was pleasantly surprised by how well written and made this movie is. It is a very bleak movie, a nice change from the regular Hollywood fare. A group of oil rig workers board a plane that takes off from an unspecified point in Alaska. Hearing one of the characters mention ""Anchorage"" I would assume that these workers are taking off from a place much farther north (there is a LCD screen in the plane, with the map of Alaska that is supposed to trace the flight's path to its destination but it is never clearly visible) and headed to the Alaskan capital.The plane starts to malfunction and violently crashes on a remote and unspecified area of the Alaskan wilderness. Out of the roughly 20 something passengers, only 8 survive. Almost immediately, John Ottway (Liam Neeson) reluctantly assumes a leader position and tries to organize the rest of the survivors to collect whatever debris is burnable to make a fire and survive the night. The weather is merciless, the wind is beyond freezing and to make things worse, they soon find out they are surrounded by a large pack of hungry (and highly intelligent) wolves. ""The Grey"" then turns into a wolf vs man horror/thriller, with the wolves slowly killing each of the survivors as they try to find a way to the south. Memories of films like ""Wolfen"" (with its intelligent wolves), ""Alive!"" (about the Andes tragedy that befell an Urugayan rugby team - a true story) and ""Frozen"" (no, not the Disney kids movie. Look it up here on the IMDb) came to mind either because of the wolves or the extreme circumstances for survival.One thing that caught my attention was that, being a ""present day"" film, none of the survivors seem to carry a cel phone or make an attempt to communicate using one. Being a film from 2011, GPS mobile phones were already a common thing, so that's one thing to stood out like a sore thumb (even though if the actually had any cel phones, they probably would not locate any signal and their batteries would've run out pretty quick). The gory effects of masters Nicotero and Berger will surely make you squirm and Liam Neeson is always a guarantee for a great movie. Director John Carnahan was ambiguous on many levels: Where exactly was the oil rig? Why no cel phones? What caused the plane to crash? What was the ultimate fate of Ottway?""The Grey"" is not a film for the meek nor a film for those who want their action packed thrillers with a happy ending. This is a violent and bleak affair, but well within the realm of real things. A great ""no win scenario"" film!",The Grey
151,adi_2002,Fight for survival,7,12 September 2013,"A group of workers collapse in Alaska by plane while returning home and now are forced to fight bitterly cold, the lack of food and water and a pack of hungry wolves who have invaded their territory. Of all the passengers only a few manage to survive and with them is Ottway an experienced man when it comes to wild animals because it deals with their hunting. They are in a critical situation because the survivors must find a way to survive thus the idea of Ottway decide to embark on a journey to a forest a few miles away. But on the way wolves do not let them alone until they reach the destination killing them one at a time until the end when only Ottway manages to stay alive.The film is about survival in a very difficult environment unbearably cold but by the desire to escape and get home to your loved ones. Without some unrealistic sequences would came out much better but even so it should be watched to see what we should do if the same scenario would happen to us.",The Grey
152,Ryan_MYeah,Neeson knocks it out of the park.,8,22 June 2012,"January is often considered a dead zone for good movie making, but the month shockingly held one movie that was actually worth remembering. The Grey, a chilling, deeply thoughtful anti-action movie, is one good time.From the word ""Go!"", director Joe Carnahan paints a grim portrait of a small group of survivors of a plane crash in the icy wilderness, and fleshes that out with surprisingly satisfying development, all the while making clear commentary on religion and philosophy. Action is not the point of this movie, despite falsely being advertised as an action flick. Most of the thrills, and the emotional investment, are based more on tension, isolation, as well as issues of suicide. Also beautifully filmed, the movie features striking, even haunting cinematography.The film still has some pretty big faults, however. Despite there being a small group of characters, the focus isn't always as close as it should be, and the comic relief really goes against the otherwise bleak nature of the script. In the end, Liam Neeson is the utmost highlight. Forget Taken and any other bland cash cow roles, this performance is the real deal, and one of Neeson's very best ever. He may look tough on the outside, but Neeson has no trouble with letting his emotional guard down. You can really tell, and easily believe, that this character has been through hell. A scene in which he goes through the wallets of deceased men is simply gut-wrenching. I would be unsurprised if this remains one of the best performances of the year.**** / *****",The Grey

Lot's of memorable scenes in this movie, great acting all around, great music score, you have to love that line and poem 'Once more into the fray. Into the last good fight I'll ever know. Live and die on this day. Live and die on this day.'. Lots of great literal imagery, and what I like about this movie is that it looked like it was going to be like every other movie out there with the basic cliché ending, but it's not, they all die. This movie had the guts to go there, and how it got made with that ending is amazing to me, but I'm very glad it got made like that. It's a movie about being at peace. You can't look at them all dying literally. In that situation you would die, and they did. But most of them found a great peace before they died, either moments before they died or a day or two before they died. They found peace and a beauty that is immeasurable to any Hollywood plot and Hollywood ending. The peace they find in themselves and through each other is what truly makes this movie special. I think we would all like to find a certain peace on a day to day basis, but to find it in your final days here on earth, that would be something pretty amazing within itself. A great movie! Also, Dallas Roberts was fantastic as usual.",The Grey
155,jeremy3,"Entertaining, but implausible",5,15 August 2020,"At first I didn't want to see this, because it appeared to be another film that demonized wolves over understanding their complex nature. I was correct. However, I decided to look at the movie from the psychological angle. Firstly, they would know from the time of flight that the crash occurred approximately where they were. It appeared to be southeast Alaska. There are no people, other than maybe a few hardy ones, except along the coast. So, they should have just stayed put and made the best from there. The wolves made a mess of that plan. From the psychological angle, I am not sure the points were clear. Each of the survivors had their own personality, but they all had loved ones that they carried pictures of in their wallets. They were all working in a very rough environment. The wolves illuminated tbe realities of their existence. All in all, the photography and scenery was great. It was entertaining. I felt at times the film was profound. I like endings that are questionable and not happy. The main character found his resolve when very little chance of surviving. However, I would not say that there was a consistent theme in the movie clear to the audience.",The Grey

Neeson, as always is a likable presence, and although the flick tries too make us care about the other characters, its pretty obvious they're all doomed to be wolf food from the beginning.Film has some scary moments, and there is some amusing banter between the planes survivors.

The colours are too bleak, which destroys the nature scenery that could have been magnificent with some colour thrown in. Many scenes are also dark, and it is difficult to see what is going on.The characters are mostly dejected and unpleasant with a loser quality to them, although they show some soft spots too, and none of them is handsome or exciting. The wolves do not look like real wolves in the close-up scenes. Too many unrealistic things happen - but I am not going to repeat them, as so many others have pointed them out already.But still, if you like disaster movies, this is passably good entertainment if you get it for free.

158,digdog-785-717538,The Fantastic Adventures of Superwolf,4,19 February 2012,"****************EXTREME SPOILERS BELOW*********************** Instead of reading my review, click on reviews, select ""hated it"", and read any of the first few pages. You'll find that pretty much they are all the same.But haters gonna hate so here is mine.Liam Neeson gets caught in the snow, bunch of people with him. Attacked by wolves, they try to fight but die because wolves are proper killing machines. In the end, he dies.It reminds me of a similar film, called Bottlenose, where terrible killer dolphins murder hundreds of defenceless swimmers at a summer resort. Except it was a shark. And was called Jaws.I feel the problem today with filmmaking is that the whole crews, production units, management etc. are too full of yes men, people who will say ""magnificent"" at any opportunity, and nobody ever says ""this is stupid, let's not do it this way""; see for example the creative process behind Star Wars - A New Hope.The Grey is a film that ceases to be a watchable film right around the 20 minutes mark, when absurdly stupid things begin to happen: wolves kill people. No sir. Wolves do not kill people; a whole bunch of wolves might kill *one* person, but no sane wolf would attack half a dozen strong manual workers, ""cuz"" a 240 pound guy with a rock would take that 50 pound wolf.. and eat it. That's right; When i saw the first wolf attack my first thought was the protagonist saying ""Wolves! We are blessed! Lads, tonight WE EAT WOLF!"".But superhuman wolves make a mess.. of this film. And let's forget the fact these lads were in a snowstorm - far deadlier in real life than a wolf pack.So, that's it for my review.If you feel like watching The Fantastic Adventures of Superwolf, then this film is for you. If you are more rationally inclined, then avoid avoid avoid.Final vote 4/10 - probably great if you are drunk.",The Grey

That only animal known to actively hunt people are polar bears..

160,gregeichelberger,Trapped in a pointless wilderness of a film,4,24 January 2012,"It's incredible (to me, at least) that a film which features elements of a horrific plane crash, being hunted by wolves, jumping off cliffs and being caught in rapids could be so amazingly dull, but this newest effort by Joe Carnahan (""Smokin' Aces,"" ""The A-Team"") is as profoundly plot less as it is pointless.I suppose I expected more from this director and the picture's star, Liam Neeson. I guess I need to start lowering the bar even more.And while there are bits and pieces of action here and there, the movie seems to lap itself with boredom in its 117 minute running time, although it feels much longer.Basically, a hybrid of ""Jaws,"" ""Alien,"" ""The Thing,"" ""Ghost and the Darkness,"" with ""Alive"" even mixed in for good measure, ""The Grey"" begins with a disjointed narrative and, unfortunately, does not improve from there.That's sad, because — even though it's January — I was hoping this would provide the shot of adrenaline I needed over these bleak movie release months. Then, to top things off, there is absolutely no payoff. Of course, I will not reveal what this means; the viewers will know more than enough when they see it for themselves.Here, Neeson plays John Ottway, who is hired to kill wolves to protect oil rig workers in a remote Alaska site. Naturally, since he hunts wolves, he also knows everything about the animals, even some facts he seems to just make up on the spot. A short airplane trip back to civilization, however, ends in disaster when the craft (for no reason other than to advance the plot, a'la ""Castaway"") crashes and burns.The isolated camp and jet were filled, as expected, with cliché characters, such as the forlorn father, the ex-con tough guy, the African-American, the four-eyed intellectual and the hippy freak, among others.The problem isn't so much that these roles have all been seen before in countless other pictures of this ilk; it's that none are fully developed enough to care about. They're basically there to serve as soon-to-be corpses, either perishing in the wreck or the horrors that come afterward.Soon after the tragedy, the seven survivors, including (of course) Ottway, sensitive Hendrick (Dallas Roberts, ""The Factory""), egghead Talget (Dermot Mulroney, ""About Schmidt""), ticked off felon Diaz (Frank Grillo, ""Warrior""), ailing minority Burke (Nonso Anosie, ""Conan the Barbarian"") and the nondescript Hernandez (Ben Bray) and Flannery (Joe Anderson), now must find a way from the remote crash site as soon as possible.Why? There's really no good reason to leave the craft with an active GPS and shelter for the men, but the script calls for this completely ridiculous move to a hostile, open ridge miles away.The group now seems to be on the lunch menu for a pack of super wolves. The animals not only have the fearless ability to attack humans day or night, they also seem to change size and scale at will and they are able to multiply into the thousands, or so we're led to believe.Like most films of this kind, the peripheral characters are simply appetizers, while those who do evade the animals must then scale down sheer mountainsides, plummet into trees hundreds of feet in the air and then fall into swollen rivers. There is no end to the depressing oppressiveness of this experience. However, after the seventh or eighth wolf attack, you begin to grow as cold and indifferent as the brutal Alaska climate. It all becomes unintentionally hilarious after a while.All the while, Ottway is obsessively collecting the dead men's wallets, for some reason that becomes even more unclear at the conclusion of this nonsense.With long, drawn-out talking sequences — briefly interrupted by ridiculous action scenes — and not-so special wolf effects, as well as the most disappointing of endings, you may well feel trapped in the Alaskan hinterlands with no way out while watching ""The Grey."" Just call me the boy who cried ""wolf,"" but likely no one will hear this voice in the wilderness. I did my best to warn everyone, though.",The Grey
161,theinaniloquent,"""Live and die on this day""",9,18 February 2012,"In Alaska, an oil drilling team struggle to survive after a plane crash strands them in the wild. Hunting the humans are a pack of wolves who see them as intruders.I'm going to say this only once. If your expecting Liam Neeson to kick wolf's asses, leave now. I'm being serious, because this movie is nothing you'd ever expect. Now that I got that across, let's proceed... I expected the same thing that everybody else expected, and had only watched for it to entertain. The Grey, again, is nothing as you'd expect. The movie has lots of symbolizing, and metaphors. Everything is hidden beneath it, and after the ending you'll be able to suck it in. I'm not going to spoil anything, but it seriously gets you. First things first, the acting was really great. Liam Neeson, you already know he's going to do great, but the other plane-survivors are the ones worth noting. There wasn't even complaints in that isle. The story was actually very generic. It wasn't anything new, or original, and it was VERY predictable. That's what people are saying, but they missed the whole point of the film. Everything about the plot is actually a metaphor, but again I'm not going to spoil it for you guys, you just need to see it for yourself. Then there's the beautiful soundtrack, with added so much more depth to the film. At times it can be beautiful, poignant, and deep. At others the soundtrack can be terrifying, brutal, and intense. The soundtrack really added to the whole, and it was one of the high points of the film. Next, we have the ending. This is what angers everybody, which is understandable, but they're missing the entire point. I, myself, found the ending beautiful. When the credits started to roll, I sat speechless, lost for words. The movie is very thought-provoking but only if you can find the deeper meaning. It's a mind game for some, but it should come easily for others. I loved the Grey. I never expected just intense epicosity. It made you think and think, and you'll love it. I recommend, but for ones with a brain. If you want a complaint, the only one I can think of is it's enduring scenes. 9/10.",The Grey

But otherwise it is just a string of clichés and pointless CGI.The holes in the plot come thick and fast - not least why they start off with sharp sticks but don't both making any more for when they go traipsing through the wilderness (with tree branches a-plenty). Nor why, in this day and age or search and rescue, they leave the crash site which can still provide shelter. They could have thought of a better reason to get the men moving so that the story could unfold.But this is not a movie to worry about the plot or the script. It is simply to go along for the ride. The trouble with that is the story soon feels like a 10-minute loop and the wolves seem to have been borrowed from some teen werewolf movie.Not original; not well acted; not particularly exciting.",The Grey
163,fung0,No-win Scenario,6,12 April 2012,"If you enjoy 'survival' movies, you'll love the first half or two-thirds of The Grey... And then feel let down by the Big Statement finale that's offered instead of a human story pay-off.To be sure, this is a film with many great elements. The somber grey imagery. Liam Neeson's usual stalwart performance. The vivid supporting characters. The genuine sense of primal fear. The detail of survival and escape in the frozen wilderness. All great stuff.Unfortunately, in the latter half of the film, you may begin to suspect (correctly) that the whole thing is going to take a dreary allegorical turn, draining away the genuine dramatic possibilities in favor of a trite and heavy-handed philosophical statement. It's a statement you'll probably agree with, if you're the sort of person who's watching The Grey in the first place. But, paradoxically, that will only make it more disappointing.Let me put it another way. This film makes a painfully obvious statement: that life is about the conflict not the resolution; that it's about the chase and not the capture. Unfortunately, by being so obvious, the film violates the very principle it's trying to demonstrate. It becomes about the conclusion and not about the story arc; about the ultimate meaning, and not the conflict that we'd very much prefer to be involved with.For the audience, it's a dramatic no-win scenario. If you buy the message, you can't possibly enjoy the way it's presented. (And of course, if you *don't* buy the message, you'll have left long before it's delivered.)Bottom line, while The Grey is not a terrible film, it's a very difficult one to fully enjoy. My suggestion, if you like this kind of film in the first place: watch Alive, or The Edge, or Snakes On a Plane, or The Lost Patrol... or any of the many other films that use the same survival format, but are satisfied to let Deep Meaning take second billing to the human story.",The Grey
164,Tcarts76,Ho Hum,6,20 September 2012,"To me this movie was way over hyped and did little to gain my attention. I saw endless previews for it on TV when it came out on PPV claiming it was such a great thriller. Well, duped again. Either film makers these days have drab, boring,and simple imaginations or we, the viewers, have no more intelligence left in us.It gets a low six for me. OK Liam Neeson was fine as the old gruff wolf hunter hired to protect workers in the Artic from the dangers of the big bad wolves. I am sorry but I haven't heard very many tales of wolves dragging away workers in the frozen tundra in droves requiring employees out there to have a need for protection by these mystery loner type, mercenary hunters, so already this movie is sour. I watched Ice Road Truckers, they never seem to have a mad fear of evil wolves coming to get them if their trucks break down. The survival aspects of the plane crash were pretty good, but I think staying warm would probably be the biggest struggle, but this film still sticks to the ""Phantom Devil Wolf"" foe. The personal stories of the men involved are there to try and get you to feel something for the character before they are chomped into dog meat patties. The intent is good, the acting is alright, but please, just grab a stick and beat the dogs off and get on with it. Maybe they should have gone in a different direction like maybe some redneck Alaskan family was hunting the survivors down to make wallets out of their skin, or maybe the plane was sabotaged because there was a secret cache of gold or diamonds aboard and some rogue troop of bad guys was racing to kill them for it.Don't get me wrong, getting followed and having a hungry pack of wolves hiding in the darkness through every move would be a terrifying thing, but there are also bears out there that attack and kill more people than their barking counterparts.So just as a fan of plane crash/survival movies I give it 6. Again Liam Neeson can act but this movie just can't be saved from the critical wolf giving a review. Way too much hype for way too little substance.",The Grey
165,brianberta,"Flawed, but it has an excellent philosophical agenda",7,15 April 2015,"If you look at my profile then you'll see that all of my reviews are one paragraph. I was just going to write another paragraph for this review but I think it's necessary to go into detail a bit.The audience is divided over this one. On one side, people are calling it unrealistic. And on the other side, people are praising it for its philosophical agenda. I'm going to cover both sides of the argument.Firstly, I'll address some of the hate. I admit that this movie is unrealistic. The way the wolves behave aren't correct. However, I think that point is invalid. Keep in mind that this is just a work of fiction. It's not a documentary from the discovery channel. As long as it's not pretending to be 100% accurate, I see no problem with it.Also, I also feel that the argument has a bit of hypocrisy to it. Let me explain. Take the movie Jaws. In real life, sharks don't kill as many people as possible. But, when I look at reviews of Jaws, I don't see people complaining about the accuracy. Both of these movies have flaws about a type of animal yet only this movie receives hate. I don't get that. You can't call out this movie for being unrealistic and ignore it when Jaws does it. If you look at my profile then you would see that I gave Jaws a 10/10 so obviously suspension of disbelief didn't affect my review of that movie. I'm also going to ignore the errors for this review because it really didn't bother me that much.If you want to hate this movie for having these errors then I'm fine with that as long as you say the same things about Jaws and other movies that have the same errors.Another big point people are bringing up for why they hate the film is the ending. After Liam is the last survivor, he comes face to face with the alpha wolf and just as they're about to fight, the movie ends. Some people dislike this because they wanted to see the outcome of the fight. But what many don't know is the scene that plays after the credits. After the credits, we do get to see the outcome of the fight. We see Liam and the wolf both laying on the ground. So the movie's ending is ambiguous.Some people still may not like that which is understandable. But again, I see some hypocrisy in that as well. Take the ending of the 2010 movie ""Inception"". In the end, it appears that Dom is going to be reunited with his kids but the last shot shows the spinning top and it doesn't show us whether he woke up or is still dreaming. The movie cut out but no one complained that the movie didn't show us the ending. Everyone seemed to be okay with it. My point is that you can't complain about this movie's ending and ignore it when ""Inception"" and other movies have ambiguous endings. I like endings with ambiguity so I enjoyed this movie's ending. If you didn't then fine. Just don't let other movies get free passes.Now it's time for the positive parts. I strongly agree with the philosophical points. This movie is pretty philosophical. We kept on seeing glimpses of a woman and Liam in bed. The woman kept saying ""Don't be afraid"". He also said in the beginning that he can't be with her because she left him. So I assumed they divorced. But at the end, it shows that she was in a hospital bed and she died. I think that's a great scene because it lets us relate with him.Now there's that poster line that read ""Live and die on this day"". This has a lot of meaning to it and it sums up the movie. It means that every single one of us no matter who or where we are will have only one day, that upon which we will both live and die. It's up to us what we choose to do while we live on that day, but death will find us regardless.Liam Neeson does an excellent job of conveying so much. Everything about this moment, where he carried the emotional weight and legacy of all those men (symbolized in their wallets) and he was willing to fight vicariously for them, against this literal and metaphorical beast before him, embodies the traits of a man. The willingness to face adversity; the will to press on with life, despite its numerous vicissitudes, is life's ultimate purpose. There is no goal at the end of this. It's the struggle that imbues life with meaning and significance. I really love that scene.Also, ""Into the Fray"" is a really fitting song for that scene.I cared a lot about Liam Neeson because of that. Unfortunately, I can't say the same with all the other men. At the end, we saw their wallets and we found out that they had families and that was supposed to make us care for them. However, the scene happens in the final few minutes and the movie didn't give me enough time to make any real connections with them in those few minutes.Also, this movie has a ton of swearing. It's rare for this to be a flaw in a movie. However, I felt like the movie was forcing a lot of the curse words in it and much of them felt very unnecessary.In conclusion, I think all of the people giving it low scores need to stop and think about the message the movie's trying to convey. The movie did play second fiddle with the other survivors and the action sequences were a bit tiresome for me but it's still a great movie.",The Grey
166,manendra-lodhi,Charming surviving story..,8,18 May 2012,"I always love how Liam neeson delivers his lines. The film starts off with a very impressive narrative. Within 5 minutes I thought it would be some kind of gangster film. But I turned out wrong , which I like to be. It is funny to me that always in one film or the other Liam possesses a very special set of skills. He is most suited for roles like this. The film included an impressive ending too. I read that many did not liked it but that was really kind of what was deserved. The location does provide a thrilling feeling. The Film once again established wolves as a subject of fear again! However some point in the middle i felt disoriented when they started talking about their families.",The Grey

168,heisenberg12,Into the fray of originality,9,13 July 2015,"Once more into the fray Into the last good fight I'll ever know Live and die on this day Live and die on this dayOne of the best films of the 2010s by far. The primary reason is because it is one of the few truly ""original"" movies of the early century. You will only enjoy this film though if you like and appreciate something new and different. It's a fantasy movie. What if? What if you were stranded out in the arctic woods after a plane crash and being hunted by a pack of wolves? It's pretty intense. Many people have criticized the wolves' behavior and the way they look, but why not? This is fiction. Do great white sharks really do what they did in Jaws? No. In fact, the story Jaws was based on is thought to have been a Bull Shark, not a great white. It's still a classic. Now, I wouldn't put this up there with Jaws, but it is definitely a good film and very underrated. It's more of an artistically made movie than an action or horror movie. This is wilderness movie. If you like the outdoors and appreciate unique settings like frigid arctic outdoors, you will like this film. However, it does go in directions that you wouldn't expect going in. It's not a fist punching wolves movie. It's a survival story with a somber tone. While I know some people hated it and disliked it, I was thoroughly entertained.",The Grey
169,axlrhodes,Tense and suspenseful. Not the slick Hollywood exercise i had anticipated. Very good.,8,26 June 2012,"Having seen Liam Neeson make the unlikely step from proper actor, to proper actor/worlds number one action star, i was expecting much the same formula with The Grey. In my minds eye this was going to be 'Taken' with wolves, although i must admit i hadn't properly thought out how he'd do his famous phone speech on the phone with one of the wolves...maybe I've indulged too much Twilight recently. Back on point, this doesn't feel overly Hollywood at all, which considering writer/director Joe Carnahan's (The A-Team) most recent work is pleasing. The use of sound effects and lighting to create the fear is cleverly orchestrated and reminiscent of Jaws in as much as John Williams' dur-dumb theme had a similar effect. The camera mostly glimpses wolves in shadows rather than ever fully exposing them and when they are seen more clearly, the animatronics and effects are good. The film is at it's most tense when the guys are sat round camp fires at night. The knowledge that a wolf could leap out of the dark at any given moment creates an uneasy feeling. I recall suspenseful scenes in Jaws 2 when a character is chased by the shark as he's swimming for all his life to get back to his boat? There a similar feeling here during a scene when the guys are trying to run through deep snow to escape chasing wolves. Every step slows them down as they sink a few feet in. From a performance aspect, Liam Neeson is outstanding. Knowing that in real life, he lost his own wife in a tragic accident really resonates here as his character uses the memory of his loving wife to battle the elements as well as the wolves. Neesons character is a man that has all but given up on life, yet somehow finds meaning and a will to live in the dire circumstances. This film is less about the wolves and more about men battling their own demons. I think ultimately, it was a less showy film than i had expected which was good to see. Great work from all involved.",The Grey
170,Saiph90,Films are illogical,6,20 January 2013,"Reading reviews a lot of 1 stars are given due to the fact that they leave the plane when they should have stayed put, which is correct, it makes little sense wandering around in deep snow getting picked off by the wolves. The same logic applies to horror movies, people wander off alone in a house with a serial killer on the loose, its called ENTERTAINMENT, with out it we would watch an hour and a half of boring people huddled in a room, a bit like big brother.Anyway the film, this could be a science fiction movie of survivors in an alien world being attacked by aliens, forget that the wolves simply do not act like wolves. I thought Liam Neeson was excellent, his world weary approach, his realisation there is no god just an uncaring universe, which is indifferent to you living or dying.",The Grey
171,aleksanderk-95350,A film that grows on you,6,22 March 2021,"At first like most people I did not like the ending of The Grey. After thinking about it I enjoy the film more. Understanding the meaning behind the film and it's ending. It's a hard hitting film about mortality. The way I see it Nesson's character kept reading the poem. He lived in the beginning by not killing himself. At the end he finally decides to give death a good fight. He probably dies like his poem, said live and die on the day.",The Grey
172,MickeyTheConstant,A Real Surprise,10,20 February 2019,"So I watched this movie thinking it was going to be a Liam Neeson survival action movie. By then end I was truly stunned. The survival stuff is all really only a sub plot. This is a movie which truly centres around coping with grief, how death is handled by the individual, not just a loved ones death but inevitably your own. Without giving too much away, Neeson's character has little to live for at the start of the movie, we can feel his sorrow, pain and hopelessness. He does not feel part of the world and is lost. He has ran away to the far end of the earth to hide. The situation he finds himself in later in the movie, dealing with the plane crash, cold and of course the Wolves gives him a reminder that he can contribute in so many ways and maybe there is hope. He finds fellowship and comradeship with the guys he is with and also laughs, enjoying their companionship. By the end he realises he wants to live and will do what it takes to survive. The wolves howling gave me chills and was at times almost Supernatural. The poetry was powerful. Watch it but please don't think this is another Liam Neeson Taken type movie. It's so much more. I have seen it about 3 times now and each time it unsettles me but at the same time affects me to the extent that hours later I am still thinking about it. Powerful cinema. One of my favourite movies.",The Grey
173,colinrgeorge,A Flea-Bitten Excuse for an Epic,4,26 January 2012,"So it's come to this: Liam Neeson, a pack of wolves, and a filmmaker with delusions of grandeur. The Grey might have passed as merely a second-rate survival flick had it laid off the pseudo-intellectual grandstanding and quickened the glacial pace. Unfortunately, its shepherd, Joe Carnahan, knows no such restraint. Bloated, juvenile, and absurd, the movie attempts to pass off a few cheap thrills as an ode to humanity. Oh, and according to Carnahan, it may return to theaters to make an Oscar run in October. Give me a break.Neeson plays Ottway, a professional wolf hunter with a penchant for internally reciting corny poems written by his deceased daddy. ""Once more into the fray/ Into the last good fight I'll ever know/ To live and die on this day,"" he rasps. Hey, how that's poetry elective going? It might seem profound as a beer hall anthem to rally spirits in the fourth quarter, but it's embarrassingly maudlin as the emotional crux of a movie. But enough about poetry — let's talk about wolves.A plane crash strands about half a dozen men in The Middle of Nowhere, Alaska. Hounded by a pack of edgy predators, the crew must literally fight for their survival. Never mind the practical how-tos like sustaining an expedition without potable water — they've got man- hungry wolves on their tail! The biggest, nastiest wolves special effects can conjure, though they're mostly relegated to chasing everyone from one tired setpiece to the next.Here's the problem — with riveting wilderness docs like Touching the Void and Encounters at the End of the World streaming online, there's no excuse to settle for such a stagey drama. But Werner Herzog is obviously beyond these morons; someone in The Grey paraphrases Grizzly Man as that movie about ""The fag and the bears."" Are these guys from Alaska or a college fraternity?I don't demand that any character be likable — but I ask that they be interesting. Not a one in Ottway's ragtag group of ""fugitives, drifters, and assholes"" brings a single compelling trait to the table. Ottway wins the likability contest by default, even though his character might as well be the Wikipedia page on wolves for all he contributes to the conversation.And it's a shame we're stuck with such shallow people, because their trek is often atmospheric, and the many perils they face might mean something if we actually cared about who they are. Writer/director Joe Carnahan can get by on keen visuals, but he writes like an emotionally stunted 19-year-old. His ceaselessly abrasive, hollow characters engage in dialogue with all the wisdom and wit of a whirring garbage disposal. Their pointless, profanity-laden bickering and eventual, manufactured camaraderie play stilted, not uplifting. Just die already.The Grey is a mangy, flea-bitten excuse for an epic with an obnoxiously inflated self-image. Nowhere in its unwarranted 117 minutes does it possess a shred of the intellectuality it pompously aspires to, nor does it achieve a badass nirvana despite its consistent, cocksure projection of masculinity. Carnahan succeeds in scoring a few cheap thrills, but he ought to leave the philosophizing to the artists. End rant.",The Grey
174,thekyles99,This film inspired my new biggest disappointment list!,2,11 November 2012,"The Grey This film inspired biggest disappointment list!!! 2/4 stars Before i begin reviewing this so-so film i have to mention that this film has inspired me to create a new movie list entitled 'Biggest Hollywood Disappointments' that will place this movie at #1 and probably will remain #1 for some time. I had such high hopes upon seeing the trailer for this. I am not the biggest Liam Neeson fan at all although at times i will agree he shines and can actually be quite cool. (His performance in the Taken films for example) I had heard, which later turned out to be a lot of hooey, that he of coarse spends a majority of the film battling wolves of gigantic proportions, sure their were wolf attacks unfortunately though too dark and fast to even see the wolf pack at times, however none involved Neeson's character like i was told. Now for those that haven't seen the film and plan on it some day can stop reading my next part of this review...go ahead i'll wait... OK their is this huge 'alpha' male wolf who of coarse is the leader of the pack that we see quite often throughout and it doesn't take a course in brain surgery to know that sooner or later the wolf and Neeson's character are going to bang heads, fast-forward to the ending Neeson is cornered, the lone survivor, sitting right smack dab in the wolf's den when we see the 'alpha male' appear growling as Liam is getting himself ready by strapping broken small airplane booze bottles to his knuckles. Looks like it's going to be the ultimate showdown of man vs beast...they lunge at each other....the screen goes black and credits start to rise? I'm like screaming now at my TV "" NO NO NO!! WTF????"" All that tremendous build up for what? The characters in the film i hardly felt for except for a couple and the storyline was basically the equivalent of any Friday The 13th film ...slowly the cast is getting killed one by one..only the killers aren't Jason...but a pack of wolves. ZZZZZZZZZZZZIf you enjoy wolf films that are far fetched then may i suggest this to you...Me, myself? I'll chalk this one up to be the biggest disappointment of 2012..",The Grey
175,XhoXhuXhamen,Horrid Horror About The Big Bad Wolf. Yikes!,1,11 September 2021,"Several years ago a young man hiking in Saskatchewan, Canada was attacked and killed by wolves. So much for the Nice, Harmless Wolf Stories we've been inundated with for the past 30-40 years!Anyway, The Grey is a similar tale of the Hateful, Spiteful, Revengeful Big Bad Wolf. But if ever an animal could possibly be demonized to the point of complete fantasy à la the infamous Big Bad Wolf from Red Riding Hood, the particular wolf in this film is such a beast. Actually, he has more in common with Smaug or Moby Dick than a wolf. But, let's not pick peas.Anyway (Again), this tale of the a plane-crash survivor and the oil workers he was hired to protect is little more than a sorry excuse for filming some really beautiful country. Neeson's character is not necessarily bad or evil, but he's not the least bit likeable either. In truth, I identified with the wolf more. And wolves are anything but cute and cuddly.",The Grey
176,Slarkshark,Once More Into the Fray,9,27 October 2020,"This is the second time I've watched this movie and my opinion on the film could not be more different from the first time I watched it. I saw this in theatres nine years ago, and I remember leaving the theater disappointed. But, nine years later I thought I better give it a second shot. I enjoyed it so much more the second time around, I could not believe how different I felt about it.The first time I was mainly disappointed with the ambiguous ending, and felt robbed of the final fight between Ottway (Liam Neeson) and the alpha. The trailer showed clips of the fight, yet in the actual movie we got nothing. I didn't know there was a post credit-post fight scene, but it still leaves the viewer wondering.This may sound silly... well because it is, but I saw a meme years ago which had Neeson in 'Batman Begins' talking about his wife, but also implying he was the same character from 'The Grey', therefore he survived. I liked to believe that was the case. And speaking of his wife, the first time around I thought he was only sad and suicidal that she left him, as in divorced him. Not sure how I didn't catch on, but of course at the end it gives a definitive answer that she died.Now, the second time around. I was able to see the beautiful metaphors and overall message on death, survival, perseverance, and grief. The wolves and elements represent death and they are not a respecter of persons; it comes for all. The music is beautiful, in conjunction with the poem, and those flashbacks, it pierces your soul.
I am a fan of many of the actors including James Badge Dale, Dermot Mulroney, and Frank Grillo. They all did well at playing seasoned oil workers, though were very unique people with different stories. The scenery was exceptional. Ottway's struggle to continue life, to leading a survival exodus, losing all companionship, questioning the existence of a higher power, to facing almost certain death head on was so emotionally captivating.Not the most realistic movie, I get that, and again probably a factor in my original dislike. But, if you're able to look past some of the more outlandish scenes, this is a very deep movie that deserves your attention and contemplation.",The Grey
177,Fields201,Twilight Meets Liam Neeson,8,27 January 2012,"In a strange crossover, the CGI wolves from Twilight decide to walk onto the set of The Grey. At least they are more terrifying here than they are in those movies.Liam Neeson stars as John Ottway who can't stop obsessing about his dead wife. In fact, that's all he dreams about. He's a lonely, suicidal man with a job of hunting wolves to protect the oil workers, and they send him off in a plane with them. The plane crashes, with one of the most impressive plane crashes I've seen on a film, and Liam wakes up covered in snow, and looks for survivors. Soon they realized they are in wolf territory and they are being hunted with no help seeming to come find them. Suddenly it's survival of the fittest.I'm a huge fan of Liam Neeson and he's still awesome here just like all his other movies. I also liked the characters around him, and I was pulling for them to survive. What I particularly like is how deep the film is, especially with the concept of death. It's handled very well, and it felt realistic like the scene where Liam was coaching someone who was about to die. I can almost feel the emotion in that scene.The action in the movie is also good, and although there are some nice scenes of them talking and building character, you won't be bored. Well, the little girl behind me was bored, but whoever brought their young child in a movie like this needs to be thrown to the wolves. I highly recommend The Grey, but be forewarned that it's not a feel good movie. The action is riveting (like the scene where they have to climb a rope on the mountain) but the movie feels more human than most. These aren't Hollywood tough guys and they come off like real people. The only thing that bogs this movie down is the fake CGI of the wolves. They should have used real ones. Were they afraid they would look like a smaller budget with real wolves? The movie Frozen did that. Other than that, it's a great movie! Definitely leagues better than any of the Twilight movies.",The Grey
178,vailsy,"good movie, bad ending",6,24 September 2012,"*spoilers* I really enjoyed this film and would have rated it an 8 had the ending been better but unfortunately the ending is disappointing for two reasons firstly his relationship with his partner who apparently left him is sugar coated by the fact that she actually died and didn't leave him after all.. why do movies always need to do this? a person can never just have been divorced because he wasn't around or wasn't a good husband there always needs to be more to it secondly the chances that they would end up walking all that way and then ending up in the wolf's den is ridiculous. they are in a vast wilderness, head through forests and make a river crossing, never once see a wolf ahead of them, and yet end up precisely at the den, ridiculous just wouldn't happen the wolves by the way especially the alpha did not look or behave naturally to me. I've never seen a wolf in the wild but have seen enough nature documentaries to know they don't behave as depicted here definitely worth seeing and a very good movie but pity the ending is not better",The Grey
179,headhunter46,Gripping movie about survival in very harsh conditions.,8,7 January 2017,"I gave this an 8 due to some things there were not realistic and a few other things that were bad judgment if people watching this should ever be in the same situation.The movie is very realistic in most ways. It demonstrates the spectrum of human emotions that emerge in disasters both good and bad. The scenery is real, the mountains sometimes breathtaking. The struggle to survive was well demonstrated.I quickly found myself wondering if any of the people would get out alive.Two things that caused me to rate it an 8 rather than 9 is the men left their defensive sticks at the first campfire. If you have to worry about wild animals you sure as dickens carry a sharp stick with you. Liam Neeson did give good advice about hardening it in the fire.Later, some of the men, especially Liam, do not have their hoods up to protect the head. In severe weather we can lose a tremendous amount of heat through the head, so if you end up in this sort of pickle KEEP YOUR HEAD COVERED.

You see, they're in Alaska, hundreds of miles away from the nearest home, much less a 7-11.Meanwhile a pack of 'rogue wolves' follows them around with the mysteriousness of Bigfoot, killing off these half-wits one by one, like something out of an old B horror film. To make matters worse, the director films half the movie at night so we can't make out a damned thing. Did some guy's foot just get eaten off?! I don't know, I thought it was his hand!

Nowadays, no movie dare come out for more than a few hours, than you have all the know-it-all Pointdexters flocking to IMDb to vigorously tap their prissy little fingers. By God (no wait, they don't believe in that; nowadays the 'in' thing is to be a lost fool) they're going to tell you, point by point, exactly why the film did not faithfully and painstakingly conform to real life.America--back when it was America--had imagination, once. Now it's just a bunch of automatons with all the emotional intelligence of a tree stump.That aside, let us first state the obvious. No, the behaviour of the wolves is not realistic. It's not realistic in the least. But we don't care, because we are intelligent, educated viewers who understand the point of a film is to be, uh, unrealistic.Others are having a hissy fit over the film giving wolves a bad rap. How is this possible? Oh, wait, I know. Because in today's pinko dumbed down America, the doofus masses get their information from movies, not books. Even one of the characters in the film perfectly echoes the average low IQ, uneducated demeanor of a typical American nobody, where his idea of knowledge is, ""I once saw on the Discovery channel.""Now that we're done with that, let's get to the film.There seems to be a thing lately with these survival films. ""Frozen,"" ""The Reef,"" ""Open Water"" and its sequel. And they are NOT cheery in the least. Of course, being movies, the people who come up with them try hard to make them relevant by creating full-rounded characters. It's not about the predators, it's about the humanity; the relationships.All these pale in comparison to ""The Grey."" ""The Grey"" captures the pain and regret of a failed life. It's a film about wasted lives, about mistakes that can no longer be corrected. It's about men and the women-- daughters, wives, girlfriends--from whom they seek warmth and love.It's a beautiful, sad film, and a bloody well done one at that.Emotionally mature people will see the beauty in this movie. Let the whiny little brats pound their feet and fists against the floor. They are the unwashed masses.

182,CMTiago,Intense survival Drama that ultimately pleases the audience,6,28 May 2014,"The Grey is not an easy movie to watch, with some grueling scenes that will leave you shocked. Personally I didn't connect too much with the movie, but in the end I found it to be rather enjoyable, if only a bit of a drag. Liam Neeson stars as the expert huntsman, who must now lead a group of plane crash survivors against a pack of vicious wolves. Neeson is at his usual best in the film and despite taking a bit too long to get there, you finally understand his character at the end of the film, which in turn makes you root for him even more. In a midst of good secondary performances and the wonderful tension felt when the wolves are near, The Grey shows a dramatic side I thought wasn't there, which not only adds to its quality, but also its repeat value. I also noticed that this isn't a type of movie Neeson has done recently, which may have been why I had a whole different idea of what this movie was like. In conclusion, a movie that isn't a must-see, but definitely worth a watch if you appreciate survival movies.Rating 6/10",The Grey
183,NanoFrog,Disrespect for nature and reality,3,9 March 2012,"While Neeson is very good in this film, he almost always is the most interesting character in his films...I am curious as to why he would engage in this farce. The ending of the film is just a cheap and lazy trick, the last refuge of the untalented (without giving it away). As others have pointed out, wolves would never and have never been known to behave this way. That the film has such a high rating shows how little people know, and how little they respect nature. Aside from Neeson's hunter character, not one of these drunken sods would have survived the freezing winter weather depicted in this film, so the wolves would be a mute point overall. Why a film like this is popular is beyond my understanding. perhaps it is the fear and suspense factor, keeping people on the edge as the film does. If that is the case, the movie going audience seems to be really dumbing down overall. The writers of this film have no shame, and no knowledge of the earth and the forces of nature. I feel bad that this film was made, because in the end it will lead to even more fear and misunderstandings about wolves.",The Grey

The wolves, when they appear in close up are quite possibly the worst animatronics I've ever seen in a big budget movie. Liam Neeson's accent fluctuates between his native Irish and mid-Atlantic Americanish for no reason whatsoever. The survivors get picked off one by one but they are all such foul-mouthed, whining, contemptible bores why should anyone be expected to care? It's no wonder this film was subject to a TV ad campaign as no one would have gone to see it based on word of mouth.The film is either ill thought out (if one is generous) or just plain stupid.A horrible mess and a waste of time.

185,Moviegoer19,Great Addition to Survival Films,9,20 May 2019,"I wasn't going to review this film, seeing as there already are many reviews, but because so many of them pan the movie, I am. I really enjoyed it, despite turning away from some of the more gory scenes with the wolves. I also am not usually a big fan of Liam Neeson but I must say I enjoyed how he played his role in this. I liked the screenplay: I thought the characterizations of the 7 survivors were well done and believable. Unlike many other reviewers here, I was able to suspend disbelief, and get into what was happening. I also loved the scenery, and the snowstorms. It was a visual treat. In fact, when Diaz was explaining why the other guys should just leave him and let him die, I understood perfectly what he was getting at. I found it moving and fantastic that he was so moved by the natural beauty surrounding him. Despite its Hollywood presentation of men surviving a plane crash, then being picked off one by one by scary, ferocious wolves, the movie was also philosophical and deep. Liam's character, Ottway, was both deep and superficial. And that, to me, is very real. As the film neared the end I was worried that the ending would be like the ending of ""Arctic"". It was similar in its ambiguity but it was also much more positive in that Liam/Ottway prepared once again to fight for his life. Quite profound considering that at the beginning of the story he held the barrel of his rifle in his mouth, contemplating ending his life. His trek through deep snow, trying to survive while helping the others and fighting wolves, took him a long, long way...",The Grey
186,Condemned-Soul,"""Live and die on this day""",9,18 July 2020,"Led by a commanding performance from Liam Neeson, 'The Grey' is a gripping, intense, and moving survival thriller.When a plane crashes and strands it's roughneck survivors in the Alaskan wilderness, it soon becomes clear that battling starvation and the weather is the least of their worries, as a pack of wolves are stalking their every move and picking them off one by one...'The Grey' has more on its mind than simple thrills - it makes an effort to flesh out these strangers; their beliefs, their pasts, their passions. When the wolves aren't viciously attacking, it's these quiet moments of reflection that can sometimes hit the hardest, and it pays off by the time it's emotional ending arrives.Liam Neeson puts in a typically strong lead performance as John Ottway, a depressed man who puts his bitterness with the world aside when it comes down to survival and inspiring hope in those around him. He's a formidable figure haunted by his past, and the man vs. nature framework works perfectly around Neeson's character.Cinematography and audio are also impressive, portraying this grand, snowy setting as the treacherous place it is, full of threats and deprived of resources. Wide landscape shots capture this harsh location nicely while the sound design bombards the senses with its howling winds and carnivorous inhabitants.Overall, this is a film that balances thriller and drama elements to induce fear and earn an emotional response. Well-filmed and featuring a plethora of good performances, 'The Grey' successfully depicts the extremes of survival with a thought-provoking philosophical agenda at its core.9/10",The Grey

Well they even were given a solid script, good cast but managed to bugger this film up.It took all of about 25 minutes to make up my mind about this potential Oscar smashing film! It seems to be directed by some one that believes in fairy-tales, the wolves are so badly portrayed, it's like watching a kid's scary fairytale told to you by your grandma! So way over done, wolfs that sound like lions, and are about twice the size as in real nature.I don't really think that Hollywood can bring out a film that's worth raving on about, this could have changed my view on that, but failed.I can only give this a 3, I love dog's, the snow, and Liam has made great films before, so all up 3 good points, the rest is very forgettable.3 out of 10",The Grey
188,lois-lane33,A serious let down of a movie.,5,26 October 2014,For some reason I thought this film was about werewolves. It wasn't. I found it one of the most depressing survival films I have ever seen-because nobody survives. Liam Neeson is-as usual- good to better than good as an actor-but whomever wrote this little bit of nothing seemed to have more breaking the spirit of the audience in mind than depicting something that instilled a sense of overcoming obstacles. Basically they don't overcome anything and they get their buts kicked from here to eternity which I find kind of improbable given that they are a bunch of tougher than average alpha males. They mess up all there is to mess up in a long sequence like a repetition the actions of a plane coming down which is what landed them in the soup in the first place. Don't see this film if you are feeling depressed or unhappy about something-it will only make it worse. Out of character for a Liam Neeson movie to me but I guess some people follow the work of certain actors so if you are a hard core fan of the guy-see this movie-otherwise-avoid it like roadkill.,The Grey
189,cadillac20,Fantastic Man-versus-Nature Film Will Have You On The Edge Of Your Seat,9,27 January 2012,"A lot of people will complain about this film not having enough action or being too introspective or whatever other reason they can think of not to like the film. But the reality is, this is a fantastic movie about survival when there is little to no chance of doing so. In fact, the film speaks about a lot of things. It speaks about man versus nature, about being male, and about the human spirit's need to persist. What this film is not is an action-adventure or one about Liam Neeson punching wolves. No, the trailer really pulled a number on anyone expecting a loud movie about wolf killing.The film's setup is simple: Neeson's bodyguard-like character to a group of men drilling in Alaska finds himself and several others having survived a plane crash and facing the cold, harsh wilderness in an attempt to get back to civilization. In said wilderness, they are faced with a pack of wolves who have had their space invaded by these men and are out for blood. The cast is mostly fantastic, but obviously Neeson shines in the lead role. He is the kind of hard-edged man we've seen of him recently, but like the rest of the cast, he is vulnerable. The film speaks a great deal about the male ego and what it means to actually be a man. We're told that these men Neeson is protecting are some of the worst kind of men, being criminals and just general a-holes. But when faced with such impending doom, these men show their vulnerabilities. They come across as tough and gruff. Even Neeson plays things cold and disconnected, but over the course of the film we learn about each of the men, see the things they truly care about, and even see them face fear when they would otherwise not admit to being afraid. It's a film that shatters the image of male machismo in a slow, thought provoking way.Now, I've already mentioned that the film isn't an action-adventure in the way that people might expect, but it is nonetheless heart racing (or stopping, take your pick). Nearly every minute of screen time is taken up by some kind of tension, and this is in part thanks to pure visual and audio goodness. The darkness surrounding the men, the sounds of trees breaking, or wolves howling. It all creates a frightening, edge of your seat atmosphere. And when the attacks come, they come quickly and quietly. It's unsettling and has you bracing for more. It's not just wolf attacks either. Nature is as much a killer of these men as the wolves, and facing the cold and an attempt to escape prove harrowing, and sometimes even fatal. It's a film shot beautifully, but in that beauty is true terror, the kind of which few films these days can create. Sound is as much apart of that terror as it's look, and the two combine fantastically.The film is also fairly depressing. There is little hope here, and as the men come to face their individual fates, the sense of dread grows greater. This coupled with an ending that many may find disappointing will probably turn other viewers off. I, for one, was not. The movie is still quite fantastic despite it's depressing tone, and even if the ending isn't quite what we'd anticipate, there's enough of a sense of finality in it that it seems justified. In other words, if all you expect is a film that is shallow and about what you see, instead of what you feel and think, then you will most likely be disappointed. But if you're looking for an exciting, edge of your seat, thought provoking film with a lot to say, then The Grey is something you will probably enjoy. It's certainly a heck of a good way to kick off a new year of cinema.",The Grey
190,trans_mauro,Dumb and Dumber in Alaska,1,14 June 2012,"That would be better name for the film.The script is so stupid and contrived that after a while a I was rooting for the wolves. Yes, The sooner they killed that sad lot, the better.For a movie that deals with survival, shows what men have to do to survive under extreme conditions, ""The Grey"" is one of the most moronic movies that I have ever watched. Not even trying to suspend disbelief, this pile of wolf craps works. Simply put, the people portrayed in the story did everything wrong. It is not a story of survival...""The Grey"" is the best example of what not do in this type of situation.",The Grey
191,bushtony,I'm With Liam Neeson and the Wolves,9,24 February 2012,"Some films convey superbly the sense of stomach-emptying isolation and menace of a barren, snowbound landscape - Carpenter's ""The Thing, for instance, and even the Kate Beckinsale vehicle ""Whiteout"" to some extent. ""The Grey"" tops them all. This is the best, most compelling cinematic representation of doomed men marooned in one of the most inhospitable environments on the planet.The simplicity of the narrative overlays the complexity of it's execution and the themes running beneath. Some oil-rig jockeys survive a plane crash and are picked off by a pack of marauding wolves as they try to escape to safety. Among them is a suicidal company sniper whose day job back at base is to shoot the canine threat. Not perhaps the most obvious leader, but he's the only one informed enough for the role.What follows is a nail-biting and nerve-shredding survival drama combined with a multi-layered character study of male machismo in a state of emotional disintegration and savage despair. It's about courage, bravery, fear and redemption. And it could possibly be the best film of 2012 already.There is no doubt that Liam Neeson gets better and better as a screen performer. The anguish, turmoil and crushed humanity he conveys in this film with expressions, nuances, physicality and the emotionally punishing tones and inflections of his dialogue delivery is a masterclass. His final scenes are utterly awe-inspiring powerhouse stuff. In an ideal and honest world where Oscars actually represented something of true worth and meaning, Neeson would get the best actor for ""The Grey"" hands down. In the world as it is, he'd more than likely be beaten by Adam Sandler for his part as a mentally challenged and accident prone zoo keeper in ""Fandango Chump: The Baboon Botherer Chronicles."" If you want to see something emotionally engaging, thrilling, exciting, artistically valid, brilliantly filmed and composed AND expertly acted, ""The Grey"" hits the mark. If not, guess there's always the usual gag-inducing Oscar fodder.Me, I'm with Liam Neeson and the wolves.",The Grey
192,adrongardner,The Ghost and the Darkness,8,16 May 2012,"Yeah yeah, on the surface it's a ""Man vs Wild"" survival yarn in the mold of ""The Edge,"" but when you live in cold climates it somehow hits all the right notes. Liam Neeson is excellent and one wonders if this is a sort of therapy after losing his own wife in a terrible ski accident. The cast is good, but they don't stick around for very long. For me, the movie's strength comes from the setting. There's something solemn and humbling about being out in the woods alone with snow pounding down. There's a loneliness and even power one feels when trudging through the hills and the powder comes down. This is what I related to with ""The Grey.""There's very little to knock against with ""The Grey,"" other than a a couple things. Most of the plotting is amazingly predictable. While by the end we have an idea why Ottway ended up where he is, I'm thinking more could have been made on the entire basis of the movie's antagonist. Why wolves?There was something to layer in the story, however slight, to add more depth on the villain side. As it stands, the animals exist simply to add plot movement and mow down cast members. I'm not really downing on ""The Grey,"" when you enjoy a simple movie like this, you find yourself wanting more to dig through. It's a good sign when a movie keeps you thinking long past the end.",The Grey
193,Sci-FiHorrorFan,This film had potential but sadly it fell flat on its Face!.,5,7 February 2013,"I thought this film started of pretty well and i found the Airplane crash interesting and i usually like watching survival films but this one flopped in my opinion. the beginning of the film was fine and i had no problem with that but the scenes toward the end were the problems. good points: I can say i thought this film was well directed and well Acted especially from Liam Nesson and i also thought the scenery was very beautiful and the location they were in looked very nice. Bad points: allot of the characters in the film did stupid things like getting the wolfs angry by killing other wolfs and then cooking their bodies to eat because they have no food. yes i know why they did it but some of the men were very stupid. if you are out in the wilderness in the middle of nowhere the last thing you should do is make wolfs angry. there was a scene in the movie where a bunch of wolfs chased Liam and all of his travelling companions through the snow and when they do finally make it to safety what does one man decide to do? he yells at the wolfs and he holds up the head of a wolf that they killed and throws it into the woods! where they can smell it!. and then predictably what happens?.the wolfs all get angry! and i'm thinking well what do you expect? you killed one of their kind and tossed the head into the woods so of course they're going to get angry!.pretty much how i suspected the men all get killed off one by one,some by wolfs and some by other ways. there was a ridiculous scene in this film where Liam Nesson is fighting with a wolf! the wolf bits him then Liam starts punching the wolf!. that scene made me laugh my head off!.As if punching the wolf is going to do any good its a wolf! and your punches are not going to hurt him. The scene was so unexpected and silly that i couldn't help but laugh.I was actually thinking at the time Liam what the hell are you doing?. i know when people get scared they panic but using a knife on the wolf would have been much more effective and stopped him all together. Later in the film the characters do use knifes to defend themselves.What i didn't like about this film was that it was slow,it took about an hour for anything remotely interesting to happen. after the plane crash all we see is Liam and all these men walking around in the snow.they spend most of the film walking and its quite boring,they see a few wolfs, there is one chase scene and then they find shelter for the night. one by one the men start getting sick because of the freezing blizzard. I thought the film had some good character development and a couple of the characters were interesting but sadly that's as far as it goes because nothing else much happened. there is allot of walking and talking in this film and allot of arguing and blaming going on.that's another example of a stupid situation because it would have been so much easier if they had of all got along. the characters needed to work together to get through the storm not spend most of the film arguing like kids!. sadly this is quite a boring film and the tense scenes you do get aren't for very long like the wolfs for instance.one fight with a wolf then they leave and then a little later on a fight with another wolf and then they leave again and i found myself getting rather board while watching this film. as i said before there are not many tense scenes,i can admit there was one i liked when all the characters were climbing across this rope on a cliff top to get to the other side,i found that scene interesting but that's about it. i found myself caring about most of the characters and wanting them to live,there were only one or two that annoyed me but most of them were fine. Liam's performance was great as always and he did a great job playing the role of the leader of the group.he was about the only smart character there because he knew what to do to survive and none of the others did.Liam was like their follower in a way and i liked the way he helped all the men get through the sad times. but unfortunately all of that sad emotion could not save this movie in my opinion.the film was far too long boring and depressing for my liking and it never seemed to go anywhere,all through the film Liam's character has flashbacks of his wife telling him not to be afraid which now that i think of it was kind of pointless.we didn't need to see flashes of his wife telling him not to be scared because it had no relevance to the story and i did Not care about it either. And then the end of the movie when it did come was very depressing. the ending of the film was pretty bad not to mention lame and it left me thinking what was the point of this film?.because the film never seemed to go anywhere and it left me not caring at the end. so to sum things up i think this film is overrated and i don't think its as good as people say it is and it doesn't deserve all the praise it gets.The film was Average at Best and nothing more and i couldn't help but feel glad when the film was over as it never really went anywhere or achieved anything important.",The Grey

195,jaredpahl,Wolf Punching for the Intelligent Viewer,9,4 February 2019,"There is a certain type of movie you picture in your head when you hear, ""Liam Neeson vs a pack of man-eating wolves"". The Grey is not this movie. Far from the tongue-in-cheek revenge action genre Neeson perfected in Taken, The Grey is patient, and God forbid... thoughtful. That is not to say that there aren't hyper-violent explosions of testosterone in The Grey, but they are in service to a very affecting parable on life, death, and the will to survive.Liam Neeson plays a professional wolf killer, hired by an oil company in Alaska to protect the roughnecks from canine attacks. On a flight home, the crew's plane crashes, and a group of survivors find themselves trapped in the snowy wilderness with a pack of bloodthirsty wolves stalking their every move. In the wrong hands, The Grey could have easily been a tired retread of Alien or a copy of the many mediocre wilderness survival pictures where the predictable ""man is killed, group moves on"" formula wears the story down to a nub. But director Joe Carnahan avoids almost all of the usual pitfalls. Despite the familiar setup, this is not a dumb monster movie. In fact, it is an intelligent, even wise picture. There is a meditative spirit to The Grey that only builds the closer the group gets to death. The movie is about death. Not monsters or action scenes or humor, as so many similar films are. Yes, people get ripped apart by wolves, but more potent is the toll the wolves take on the men's psyches. The way each character handles the approaching inevitability of death is where The Grey is most insightful. It brings up big questions about how one might react when staring death (or wolves) right in the eyes.Liam Neeson is the key to The Grey. He is really, really good in a slim leading role (all of his character's background is in a series of brief, dreamy flashbacks). I don't mean he is just ""badass action star"" good. He is ""one of the best performances of his career"" good. This is an Oscar-worthy acting job if ever there was one. Neeson is centered, controlled masculinity from the word go. He's tender, he's vengeful, he's smart, and he's vulnerable. This is lesson number one in how to portray the reluctant hero. Strong-willed rather than superhuman. Masterful.Metaphysical existentialism is not what Liam Neeson fans might expect from a film like The Grey, but it is surprisingly present in this most unexpected master work. All I can say against this movie is that Carnahan doesn't completely shed the monster/survival movie formula. There's a bridge-crossing scene that goes on too long towards the end, but that is it. This is a great film. A meat-and-potatoes, roaringly brutal, man's movie with a philosophical edge. It's a movie full of metaphor, meaning, and insight. One that gets better the deeper into it you look. Who would have guessed?90/100",The Grey
196,FilmBuff0409,Good movie but misleading,1,18 May 2019,"I can't count how many people have told me that wolves really act the way they are depicted in this movie. First off, it's ridiculous if you have even a morsel of common sense. Wolves will not actively hunt a group of people, ever. They are fearful of humans and that fear has been passed down through heredity so, no, there is less than a 1% chance that a wolf would ever even approach a human. Another thing is the fire, a wolf will not approach a fire, whether it's one wolf or a pack of wolves, never in a million years has or will a wolf seek out a fire to kill people. Yes wolves are territorial animals, specific to their species. We are NOT wolves therefore they do not feel threatened when we are in their territory.That's just the tip of the iceberg, it's sad how many people believe in the 'big bad wolf' and how quick they are to accept what Hollywood shows in movies. I can't stress enough how wrong this movie is in every way. This review is by someone who has first hand physical experience with these animals, a domestic dog is far more dangerous than any wolf in the wild or in captivity. Don't believe everything you see.",The Grey
197,WatchedAllMovies,"Too long, not enough plot",4,5 June 2012,"If you read the back cover of the DVD, you know it's about a group of people who survived a plane crash in Alaska, only to face grey wolves attacks. How many twist and plots can you come up with for people vs wolves? The movie maker didn't come up with that many.What it didn't tell you is a lot of flash backs of a woman is added into the movie. The flash backs are not enough to tell a story, so they really serve no purpose than to stretch the movie out to feature length. I hit the fast forward button whenever I saw those flash backs.At the end of the movie, the credit screen is telling: the movie is based on a *short* story. It's no wonder they have to add filler to it to make it a long movie.On the technical aspect, a lot of the scenes are so dark I couldn't see half what's going on, and the camera zoom in so close during the fight sequences, I also couldn't see what was going on. This is obviously done to cover up the poor wolf attack effects.It is not a very satisfying movie. But at least I finished watching it.

Yes I know that the wolves don't act the way they did in this film but again I don't care. Do any of the animals in thriller/horror movies act the way they should? No!

199,piratecannon,The Wolf Man,9,27 December 2012,"Like 2010′s Frozen, The Grey seems to exist on a fairly straightforward premise: it's all about man vs. nature. While this is true, there's a little more going on than might initially meet the eye. In fact, The Grey is—in many ways—an exercise in probing the psychology of death and how humans deal with the realization of their ultimate fate.But we'll get to all that soon enough. The exposition follows a plane full of hardened oil drillers that crashes somewhere in Alaska. The central character is Ottway (Neeson), a man who's been hired to protect those working on the pipeline from the wolves that lurk in the area. Armed with a rifle, he stands watch over various sites and guns down any predator that ventures too close. As it turns out, Ottway's intimate knowledge of the behavior of wolves is something that's invaluable, as the handful of people who actually survive said crash are being hunted by a pack of the aggressive canines. As Ottway assesses the situation, he realizes that the wolves aren't pursuing the men just because they're hungry—instead, they've managed to invade the wolves' territory, and the animals are hellbent on sending a message that their turf is not to be trifled with.Eventually, the group realizes they have to abandon the temporary shelter of the plane wreckage in an effort to head south toward civilization. As they trudge through the snow, each character is expertly developed, and we find out that they're fathers, husbands, and people with cares and concerns that we can all (in some sense) relate to. As you'd imagine, the ""little things"" are put in perspective as each person battles for his very survival, and musings about God and the finality of death abound. As things become increasingly dire, I started to get the sense that the filmmakers wanted to weave a certain degree of ambiguity into the subtext; in other words, they don't bash the audience over the head with a directly overt message. This, I think, is as it should be—every person who experiences The Grey will walk away with his/her own different appreciation of the message.Of course, most people aren't seeing this because of its philosophical savvy. As the trailers for the film suggest, it's a visceral nightmare, and one that rarely relents. There are a handful of relatively unrealistic moments, but they're handled with subtlety and nothing is too blatantly ""Hollywood.""The Grey is a movie that's a much better bargain than it might appear to be on the surface. Not only do you get a bone-chilling action flick, but you also get something completely human (and it's not often that these two things are successfully intermingled).",The Grey

201,MovieProductions,The Grey-t,7,29 January 2012,"*** out of (****)Back in the summer of '10, I remember promptly awaiting for my ticket stub, unwillingly actually, for Carnahan's ""The A-Team"". To this day, I still find it a trashy, long, and overblown action extravaganza. I put it in my worsts of '10 list. Yes, I despised it THAT much. Fast- forward to '12 and I'm ready to put Carnahan's ""The Grey"" in my bests of '12 list thus far. ""The Grey"" is everything that ""The A-Team"" wished it could've been, and still leagues and miles better. It's action-packed, minus the gratuitous nature, it's impressively acted without giving off any pretentious undertones whatsoever, and it's consistently involving. In Alaska, an oil drilling team struggle to survive after a plane crash strands them in the wild. Hunting the humans are a pack of wolves who see them as intruders.Now onto the performers. With the six survivors, each and every one of them is fully developed to their greatest potential. It's quite remarkable to see that a film with such a heavy amount of characters still goes into fullest of depths to sustain each person. All did a fantastic job. As for the premise? Very intense, but well-written. The use of symbolism was truly something astonishing and coincided with the film beautifully. And how the script was executed? In such a taut and mesmerizing way. It was interesting to see the film progress and what moment would happen next.The one element that really separates this film apart is how unpredictable it is. Most survival films tend to miss the mark on trying NOT to be given away, within the first fifteen minutes. Carnahan does a great job of misleading the viewer into what they initially thought what was going to occur on-screen. With such solid film features, why the imperfect rating? For once, that ending. With such a bold project, that resolution is not only an uncompromising one, it's just a plain cop-out altogether. It's almost as if there was twenty more minutes added to ""The Grey"" and the director just cut it short and said ""See you back next year for the sequel"". That was insulting. Second, the pacing at points can be a downer. The film works as a whole, no doubt about it, but you had your scenes where you could dose off a bit or look at your watch. Fortunately enough, those moments are few and far between. And lastly, I thought the language was at times too vulgar. I understand the predicament and the cruel nature, but dropping an F-bomb five minutes or mentioning getting a piece of a woman's assets quite a few times was a bit redundant.All in all, despite its flaws, ""The Grey"" is the first film of the new year that's not only been good, but has reached the impeccable heights of surpassing expectations. It might not end up on the best of year lists because this year is quite strong (""The Dark Knight Rises"", ""The Hobbit"", ""The Avengers"", ""The Amazing Spider Man"", etc.), but if it does, I wouldn't be taken by surprise. Well done Carnahan.",The Grey

But upon watching the movie, I'm very surprised it turns out to be a polar opposite. No doubt what has presented in the trailer and other marketing campaigns all this while are simply misleading. So if you are expecting a straightforward gritty entertainment, prepare to be disappointed. Instead writer-director Joe Carnahan strips off the familiar survival thriller territory with a surprisingly metaphorical take about man vs. nature. Such radical approach might alienate many viewers but those who are willing to look deeper will find this an emotionally-captivating experience worth watching for.Full review at http://caseymoviemania.blogspot.com/2012/02/grey-2012.html",The Grey
204,Endless_01,"Excellent suspense film with a deep, existential context.",8,30 September 2019,"A high class suspense movie, with excellent performances, fantastic script (although quite depressive) that shows a realistic and hard story that turns the stomach and leaves us sitting at the edge of the chairs. Fantastically entertaining, but above all, shows the audience some excellent performances that work synergistically well among the entire cast, being this film a great example of the need for chemistry between actors and one of the best performances of Neeson, along with the Schindler List's.It has a great teamwork, complementing itself in all aspects, from the cinematography, script, editing, performances and soundtrack. The film is totally recommended to be able to spend an excellent time in a cold night and to see the history of some hard survivors through a frozen hell, being persecuted by snow demons.Although at times, it feels like the script comes in a way too hard; trying urgently to make the characters feel emotions, with some unnecessary overexposure. Despite this, the film also shows a rather existentialist background, with great messages about life and death, reaching the point where it transforms itself into an ode to struggle and perseverance.A good movie wins a solid seven for almost the entire duration of the movie, however, the end is simply superior, it is truly a sublime climax that makes it an excellent, raw suspense film.",The Grey

207,AJ4F,"Unrealistic wolf behavior, as well as human behavior",5,29 April 2012,"Overall, this was a suspenseful film, but it was too full of logical holes and false portrayals of an endangered animal to get more than 5 stars from me.PROS:Good opening sequences, up to the first scenes where the animals behaved more like Ted Nugent than real wolves.Mostly realistic rendition of cold weather and isolated conditions.Overall decent acting. Liam Neeson rarely fails on that count.The level of suspense was maintained fairly well, despite some logic errors.CONS:The logic of leaving the safety of the plane (for the woods) wasn't explained well enough, unless it was mostly about running out of things to burn for heat. They could have used the plane's body & debris as a fortress, as least for a few days. The assumption that they wouldn't be found seemed premature.Wolves were falsely portrayed as semi-supernatural, man-hating beasts with enhanced growls and evil glowing eyes (more than just reflected light). They made an initial comment about wolves being afraid of people, then threw away realism after that. With so much pressure to kill wolves in the U.S. after their lower-48 reintroduction, this was uncalled for.The scene where the guy jumped from the cliff to the tree was highly implausible, as was the flimsy rope holding them and their packs.The thug who earlier stated a strong will to live gave up entirely because of a knee injury? That scene didn't play well.The ability of a man to emerge from near death in an icy river and not suffer hypothermia was never explained.CONCLUSION:If they'd minimized the wolf aspect, maybe just portraying them as a hidden threat with howling and sparse sightings, it would have been better. There was too much supernatural wolf-power implied. If you want to go that route, a better film along similar lines is ""The Last Winter"" (2006), which was oddly panned by IMDb reviewers.P.S. The reviewer who called this film ""liberal trash"" should study what his precious oil workers are doing on an extreme scale to the Canadian boreal forest. Major land carnage is happening in Alberta, as Peak Oil forces marginal supplies into development. Oil is a necessary evil for modern life, not something to gloat over. Many of us are using as little oil as possible for that very reason. Everyone is not equally complicit in the oil game.",The Grey

209,donb-519-335075,I used to like wolves,8,24 November 2012,"It is clear from some of the other reviews that many thought this movie unrealistic and a lousy movie. I think they miss the point. There are many good/great aspects of this film:1- I loved the wolves howling - a cacophony of dread & terror; 2- I liked that the men found laughter in the face of tragedy; 3- the crossing of the ravine scene was great; 4- the last thoughts (of family, etc.) before their deaths was very good. 5- drowning scene - reminiscent of Sometimes A Great Notion ( a good movie you should see) BEST scene - Diaz's decision - you will have to watch it to know what I mean.There were some bad things: 1- no one used their hoods (I use mine when I go to a Bengals game & it gets chilly - but they left their down); 2- Liam Nesson knew everything about wolves (everyone hates a know it all).Finally the photography was great, especially the scenes of the snow in the forest - beautiful.If you want to see an amazing true story of survival - see the story of Joe Simpson in Touching the Void - this is one case where the movie is better than the book. It is a true, absolutely incredible story. So thanks for reading my review - I think The Grey was well worth the time. DonB",The Grey
210,Willie-12,Better Than Most January Releases...But Still Had Problems,6,29 January 2012,"I love movies. Always have. And if there's one thing that I've learned over the years when it comes to movies, it's this: Don't expect a whole lot out of January and February releases...and see them at your own risk. But over the last couple years there have been some pretty decent movies released early in the year. A few years ago it was Taken. About a year after that it was Shutter Island. And this year we have The Grey. Now, I will admit, I didn't like this one as much as the other two I just mentioned. But it was still a lot better than most movies that get released this time of year. The acting was very good, and there were some pretty compelling scenes (i.e. the ""you're gonna die"" scene right after the plane crash, and the final scene where Neeson's character gets prepared to do battle with the Alpha). And the cinematography was absolutely perfect. The desolation and emptiness in the landscape had a strange beauty to it that was a bit mesmerizing. I even didn't care that the ending left much to the imagination, even with the after-the-credits scene. However, what was a bit problematic, and is always going to knock a score down pretty significantly in my book, is a weak screenplay, and a lack of believability. And unfortunately The Grey had both. The dialogue, at times, was o.k., and at others was...well just not very good. And I think much of that had to do with the fact that the characters were forced to make decisions that didn't seem real simply for the sake of advancing the plot to it's nihilistic conclusion. And so what could have been an excellent film ended up just being a decent one. Still, one could do much worse when going to see a film that was released in January.",The Grey
211,bennyhagen,"Profound, frightening movie",8,18 December 2012,"While melodramatic CGI wolves with a peculiar sense for theater are pretty disillusioning, fortunately this is about the only real failure of the movie. It might not be the most intelligent flick around, but it's very stimulating nevertheless. Be assured, The Grey is not PG-13 popcorn cinema. It's raw, brutal and frightening with a surprisingly philosophical agenda that actually even works, now that's something new. It also looks amazing with great work from the crew responsible for the lighting, but there is more. This movie has a genuine ace up it's sleeve. If you ever wondered what it is like to crash with a plane at 500 mph into an ice desert, fall trough a pine tree to solid ground, be attacked by a wolf, drown in an icy river or bleed to death, look no further. As far as I'm concerned Joe Carnahan's simulation of death is as close to the real thing as a movie can get you and a profound experience. This one will certainly have a special place on my shelf.8/10",The Grey
212,thewillt08,This Movie Sucks,4,5 September 2013,"To be honest, I thought about stopping WillyT Reviews. I'm at college now and I have less free time to watch movies and I might have better things to do. Plus I have to admit my last few reviews have been less than average, an A for Effort if you will. I love movies and I love what I have built, and still building with this blog. Then I sat down with my roommate and watched The Grey and its movies like this that made me want to keep going. WillyT Reviews forever!Liam Neeson has built quite a career for himself being the trainer of Batman, Obi-Wan, two different Gods, and in Schindler's List. With a lead actor like Neeson it is hard for a movie to fail. Liam Neeson and a group of Oil Riggers are on a plane in bad weather. Everybody knows that 9 times out of ten that plane goes down. The plane goes down in the middle of the Alaskan tundra and they battle the cold and hungry wolves. I have to call shenanigans a lot during this movie as most things don't make sense and would probably never ever happen. Just about everything is wrong with this movie. I don't care about any of the characters, there are a few loose ends, and there is no ending. There are seven characters and I don't consider this a spoiler but most of them die. In a movie like this it is obvious that most of them would die. I can't tell you the names of any of them. There is the idiot who dies peeing, the annoying guy, the guy with the glasses, the black guy, Liam Neeson, the arrogant guy who thinks he should be leader but grows as a person from the experience, and the other guy. Names, I don't remember names, names aren't important. I can't even remember Neeson's name and I watched it the night before this was written. It's safe to say this was an awful movie. I was under the impression this movie was about wolves killing people with Liam Neeson. Well, at least they got Neeson right, sort of. The wolves are there but they aren't that important. They are built up at the main fear and antagonist but that lasts about 30% of the entire movie. The wolves kill two people and eat a third who was already dead. A guy goes to take a leak and gets mauled by a few wolves. The old guy- alone-and-gets-eaten cliché. It never fails. The other guy has a connection with Neeson, the main character, and he dies way too early. He is one of the few people to interact with Neeson prior to the crash and he gets killed off. He could have been developed and died in an epic and emotional way. Another guy gets sick while another idiot falls out of a tree. These characters were not only boring, they died in the stupidest way ever. One of the last guys sits on a log and quits. He taps out and its assumed he dies and is eaten. We didn't even get to see it. The end to this movie was worse than the series finale of The Sopranos. The Sopranos cut off kid sentence and that is basically what happened here. The movie sets up the wolves verses the humans, sort of, and it hints towards a big battle against the alpha wolf at the end. Great, I wanted to see Liam Neeson destroy wolves the entire time. It doesn't happen. Liam Neeson shoots a wolf in the way beginning and that is it. Liam Neeson was a loser in this movie. He could have been played by anybody on this planet. He is there for the battle, he gets ready, the alpha wolf is there, it charges, music cuts, black screen, cue credits. That was it. The movie ended. We got screwed out of an ending. Throughout the movie there are hints towards the past, especially with Neeson. Neeson is with his wife and all she says is ""don't be afraid"" that is all we know about her. We can assume she died but she is simply there to try and add depth to a lame character. We learn about others past in a buddy- buddy campfire conversation. You see this all the time and it works every time. I'm a sucker for a good conversation at a campfire. Liam Neeson gets his depth when he talks about his father and the poem. That was the best aspect of the story but it was a flash in the pan. Overall, The Grey is a disaster. The story had potential but the audience got screwed out of an ending. The deaths of characters were lazy and poorly written and there were loose ends. What happened to the guy on the log? What happened to his wife and why was she important? What happened to Liam Neeson at the end? Most importantly, why didn't we get to see Liam Neeson kick some wolf butt? I really should be thanking this movie as it rejuvenated my will to review movies. This is one of my best reviews in a while but is easily one of the worst movies I have seen in a while. The Grey gets An A for Effort.",The Grey

When i was watching The Grey i couldn't help but think of The Edge which is a superior film in every way and thats one i have watched several times. Although i stayed to the end of The Grey i would not want to watch it again.The tone of the movie is set early on . Neesons character is suicidal. The viewer is privy to flashbacks of his wife and his depressing voice-over lamenting the fact that she wont return - all this is before the plane crash! Music is used sparingly only really kicking in at the end. Its probably just as well because it would have been some sort of melancholic dirge to match the picture.Nevermind the animals i know for sure the human reactions were at times bizarre. I obviously am not alone in laughing out loud at the preposterous Alaskan rope trick they pulled off across the ravine into the trees.

This is familiar territory for Ottway whose occupation consists of protecting people from the magical creature, however, there can be only one Alpha.The Good: The film's spiritual journey connects with the audience matched with contemporary dialogue and paired with Liam Neeson's badass head-to-head fights with wolves in the Alaskan Panarama results in a pulse pounding transcendent ride.The Bad: The first act begins in an ambiguous fashion and only really develops the backstories of three characters.

220,clacura,It's NOT About Survival in the Wilderness!,10,27 April 2017,"It doesn't surprise me the negative reviews by other men who look at this movie with a survivalist mindset. This movie is not about how to survive in the wilderness being chased by wolves. It had to be marketed this way to get men into the theater! This is a movie about men dealing with deeply embedded emotions. You can see why this motive would not get men to see a movie that caused them to reflect on their lives, but that is what we get here.Men need a safe place to get vulnerable, to really deal with what is going on inside and it takes these group of men to face death in order to really get honest, to unpack the inner secrets, to ask life's meaning and purpose when they have no meaning and purpose left but to survive, especially when they need each other in order to do so.When faced against the wall of doom, what comes to a man's mind? The campfire scene is very realistic. Men joust and 'dance around the fire of their emotions' and every now and then, dive deep to what is really motivating them, what really scares them, what really matters the most. This will never happen in a bar with loud music and drink. Never. Yet, Ottway (Neeson) is carrying such intense despair he has to exit and the only conclusion for his life is to end it. How many other men in that bar feel the same? How many other men are on the edge of breakdown only to empower themselves with more drink to avoid feeling? There are many ""Christian"" movies that try to make ""God"" a magic genie, but this movie has one of the most raw, gut-wrenching scenes of a man crying out, desperate, asking for a sign...and there is none. The ""magic genie in the sky"" did not shine a bright light in a Disney-esq manner. The Director could have been tempted to give a feel good moment but did not. It was real and raw and expressed a reality many do not want to embrace, that when we need God the most, there is silence.Liam Neeson is brilliant in this movie! If I was leading a men's group, I would show this movie, take a coffee break, and then open the discussion. A lot of men went into this movie looking for a survival action packed flick and in the quiet darkness of the theater felt something very different...then probably did not know what to do after. I wonder how many men bought this DVD and watch this movie alone?",The Grey
221,CalDexter,Possibly the best thriller I've seen at the cinema in years.,10,5 February 2012,"This is going to be one of the top films of 2012. The Grey is a gripping and scary thriller that from the opening sequence you know your not watching a rehash of Predator or Southern Comfort.No sir, this film is special, it is an achievement in its genre. I went into seeing The Grey only through word of mouth from a friend who said it was my type of film. My idea of a classic film is something like Deliverance or Jaws.So i was blown away by how the director of Narc has managed to create a blend of action, horror, drama and thrills amongst survivors of a plane crash in the Alaskan mountains who are faced with the threat of being hunted and mauled by a pack of blood thirsty wolves.All the actors in this are excellent. Liam Neeson is compelling as Ottway, a man suffering from depression and haunted by the past. I wont give too much away but he brings more to his part in the film rather than a cardboard cut out superman or straight forward action hero we have seen him as in the movies Taken and unknown. The photography is excellent, the music is both compelling and at times very moving by Marc Streitenfield.The good things about this film that seem new to me is that you find yourself caring for these guys and hope that they make it, none of their characters annoyed me at all, in fact i felt like i was with them around the fires they make while the wolves howl from afar, thats how good this movie is on the big screen. Please, trust me, The Grey is one of the finest crafted thrillers I've seen in simply years. It affected me very much.Don't miss it!Cal",The Grey
222,pazu7,"Great film, but ruined by generic suspense raising tricks.",6,14 May 2012,"I liked this film but I would have rather loved it. I'd like to see it done by a foreign filmmaker. They tend to use less predictable gimmicks to manipulate the audience. I'll probably get hate for saying this but mainstream American films are developing a certain common characteristic: an over-emphasis on action and shocks that are great for films like the Avengers, (which I loved btw) but in the case of 'The Grey', they detract from the powerful drama of the story. I saw the Gray as film about existential questions, men living on the edge coming to grips with the realities of their lives and with the reality of their deaths. A magnificent tragedy. Liam Neeson was wonderful and all the cast gave excellent performances. But I found two things very annoying, and these are both common with American action/suspense type films, which I do not think the Gray should have been. One: the sound tricks, how they suddenly up the volume during action sequences or to shock the audience. Unnecessary and annoying. And two, the underlying suspense in every scene, never knowing when a wolf is going to jump out of nowhere really detracts from the purely character driven elements of the film. Great moments are ruined, imo, like the character who gives up near the end and sits against the log. You know the wolves are going to come take him, but since they had already set a precedent of shocking the audience, the tragic beauty of that scene was ruined by the underlying tension. And I think it was about 20 minutes too long. There seemed to be many scenes that were played out longer than was necessary. Overall a great story. Beautifully filmed and acted. I enjoyed it. But the conventional suspense/action approach gave it sort of an identity crisis. The drama of the men's relationships should have been the foreground story. Not the wolves. And great dialog! It should have been louder than the action scenes. Only a 6. Should have been an 8.",The Grey
223,rogerdob,A Prententious Art-house Action Film,3,28 January 2012,"This movie is more of a art house independent film. Even though this film deals with plane crashes, brutal killings, fights to the deaths, and survival skills, this film also tries to tackle big human subjects that are usually confined to those pictures found at the art house cineplex.Questions about the existence of God, lost loved ones, and deep thinking about the reason for life permeate this movie.Liam Neeson's character is supposed to be the ""hero"" and the deepest thinker among the group of men that must fend off a vicious pack of wolves. However, he doesn't seem too smart. In my opinion, almost every decision he makes for the group's survival is not the right one. Near the beginning of the film, he has the group move away from the open area of the plane crash (where search planes could see them) to the forested area where he insists they would have a better chance to fight the wolves...(in the trees?...with wolves?...I don't think so).Another compounding mistake of the film, was to save money on the depiction of the wolves...they did not look real. They are supposed to be the centerpiece of the fear and danger permeating the men's lives. However, on film, they looked fake and thus, took away for the seemingly reality of the film",The Grey

It's as if the script writers were raised on using the F word in every sentence, every character used the ill fated word in every line they spoke.

Wolves already get a bad enough rap in our culture. Here they are cast as bloodthirsty predators who hunt humans for sport (but wait—maybe they're metaphors for humansthe only species that hunts for sportnah, that doesn't work either). To confuse matters even more, some attacks that are filmed to look brutally deadly turn out to be anything but. And then there's the confusing matter of Liam Neeson's lost love. I don't begrudge a film its effective use of ambiguity, but when that ambiguity turns to obscurity and seems to unnecessarily complicate the plot and the protagonist's character developmentwell, then I take issue.""The Grey"" has actually turned up on a few critics' end-of-year ""Best of"" lists, so I took a chance and watched it in spite of the panning it had received from so many other critics.

229,Legendary_Badass,A Man's Movie,9,28 January 2012,"Liam Neeson may be the oldest white actor capable of playing the tough guy without being the old tough guy. Throughout The Grey he does what he can to lead plane crash survivors through the frozen tundra of Alaska, and no one questions his age.Director Joe Carnahan takes the audience into a bleak lifestyle amid the Alaskan pipeline. Ottway (Neeson) makes it through with flashbacks of his wife and a chilling voice over. The crash is shown from within the plane and avoids many of the common theatrics. No one is clearly shown being sucked out. For that matter most of the visual effects cast a less than ideal lighting circumstance, which drives home the motif.Injuries, freezing winds, and a lack of food are enough foes for any survivors, but our heroes are being pursued by wolfs. I'm not suggesting that it's impossible, but the behavior of these creatures puts on quite the show. They've certainly seen Halloween. Credulity is also being pushed to limits when the standards line such as ""who made you the leader"" have to be muttered and one hothead fancies a brawl. Of course Neeson's dominance of the narrative makes him a safe bet, and his buddies a risk.As the film wears on I wanted to buy these blokes more time. Despite how simple the premise I'm sure I could have been entertained for 3 hours. Maybe if the other guys had more spotlight scenes they wouldn't feel so much like Ottway's human shields. The story is simple enough that a big reveal at the end is somehow more effective for the sake that no one was waiting for it. This isn't mystery. What The Grey manages to do with the underexplored is leave the viewer with less question and more statements. The Grey is a man's movie. Fatigue and despair translate with the same forceful impact of the physical blows the survivors endure.

That being a rowdy group of oil drilling roughnecks in Alaska, and one man, played by a brooding Liam Neeson, hired to keep wolves off the premises who, after a plane crash, are all left vulnerable to a surrounding pack: yellow eyes glowing in the dark like a cartoon and growls more befitting the MGM lion.The camera shakes around so much the fanged antagonists are practically unseen, and thus, not very frightening. It's basically a wraithlike feeding frenzy of shouting, screaming, and kicking to stay alive. But something happens when the count dwindles to four survivors – a few of the performances stand out beyond Neeson's maverick: especially Frank Grillo as an existential badass who can't admit he's scared to death.But even the well-acted campfire scenes, as the men expose their soft side in the face of doom, drag so long you'll forget what the movie's about. Till the growling sustains and the group ventures further towards where exactly? Since no one had much of a life to begin with, it's hard to imagine, or care about, anyone surviving. But the main problem is the nerve-wracking direction that, with the jangly, documentary style camera-work, does successfully put you into the situation – only it's not a place you'll want to be for very long.

232,~AleXa~,"A tired, stereotypical plot line in an otherwise tense, well-directed film",5,25 May 2012,"What a tragedy. Hasn't the film industry played out the wolf as a savage villain enough? The movie could not be more unimaginative. How do people in today's day and age still believe that wolves are vicious monsters? In reality, they are timid and fearful of humans, and may only attack out of sheer desperation in hunger or to protect their young if near the den. The movie even goes so far as to proclaim this is why they are attacking, and then the survivors move miles away from the crash site and jump cliffs, and the wolves just keep on following. The ridiculousness made the movie quite hard to watch. This is such a tragedy, as the film was well-directed, Liam Neeson's character captivating, and very well acted on the whole.

But the main point is that this has nothing at all to do with real wildlife or nature. This is such an unrealistic nonsense that people like the old wildlife novelist Jack London, the master of the genre, must be turning embarrassed in his grave, though his descriptions of humans meeting wolves and struggling with grand nature was rather romanticized. But that was a century ago, this is 2011, and one is allowed to expect much more. The wolves in the Grey are so non realistic, animated out of some cruel old fairy tale, that it's sickening and disturbing. What is the purpose - to please the fanatic action/fantasy audience? As for the rest of the plot, it's at best mediocre and lacks depth and dynamics. There seems to be only one goal, Liam Neeson's tough appearance is supposed to fight the conditions and win over them alone. It's just plain silly. I couldn't care less about the Chainsaw Award, giving the prize for best actor to Neeson. The award goes with it's name. A massacre.",The Grey
234,slayerjmk95,Survival-Action at its Best,9,23 January 2012,"At first sight, this seems like the kind of movie to be panned by critics and audiences alike, being an action-survival film. When i was able to get into the special premiere showing, i will have to say, i would pay $15 to see this on the IMAX because the thrills, action and emotions running through this movie were as fast as the wolves.Liam Neeson, who everyone is coming to know as the man from Taken, was phenomenal; Liam has always been a great and amazing actor, but this movie really shows that he can do something so ""out there"" that, it feels real watching it on the big screen. This movie, fueled by Ridley and Tony Scott's vision (they produced this fine film), has elements from both of the brothers' genre-takes such as Man on Fire, Gladiator, Black Hawk Down and Blade Runner, capturing the epic, awesome intensity and thrills that only masters can handle.Even though they aren't characters, per say, they are a vital point in this movie and do a damn good job picking up and dragging the tension out (in a good way); the wolves. You'll have to see for yourself, because i was on the edge of my seat whenever they came on screen.All in all, this movie was not only a feast for the eyes, but a getaway from all the regular Hollywood fair and blockbusters being poured out nonstop. A must see for anyone who like action/adventure, suspense/thrillers and dramas with great acting 9/10 Stars",The Grey

If you are chronically cheery this would make great therapy to try and level you out. If you have suicidal tendencies I would suggest another movie.

I know them to be docile and loving they can make a very good pet. I myself have had wolves for pets. They are very good around children. This was proved to be true on the show, Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman. That is my mom's take on this movie, mine is I have to agree for to long the wolf has been portrayed. As monsters, devouring everything in sight! But in fact that is not true at all, they are more afraid us than we should be of them. They are actually very timid , beautiful and sacred animals. That all they try to do is survive and provide. That is why this movie is false, all it is doing. Is feeding people's fear even further, by showing them as ravenous hunters. That in itself is a myth, and that is why we chose not to go see this movie!",The Grey

Does the movie leave reality in the dust? Yes, for the most part. But if one looks at this movie as a fantasy, you will come away liking it.Maybe I was in the mood for this type of movie. Visceral, gritty and naturalistic. It is what it is. Let the movie take you on a journey and you'll be involved.Personally, no way in all hell would I have left the plane. I would have held up but that's not the premise.

239,mcw6957,Oh what could have been....,4,1 February 2012,I went into The Grey with very little expectations other than seeing Neeson vs some wolves. What I got in the first 15 minutes was something broader & more meaningful than that. Then the plane crashes & The Grey becomes a survival horror movie with supernatural wolves & a cast of characters that I did not care about at all because the film makers did nothing properly to flesh them out before hand.Neeson is fantastic for the entire run of the movie but everyone else is so one dimensional that in the end even Neesons character comes off a little flat.Heres where my mind went when all was said & done. What if they did away with the entire cast right up front & instead of a pack of wolves they just used the alpha or some lone wolf & let Neeson carry The Grey as a straight character study of a man fighting his demons alone. Hell they didn't even have to leave the site. Liam Neeson could have held my interest for the entire duration of this movie because he is such a good actor & because Ottway is such an interesting character either way. I understood all the heavy handed symbolism because they were constantly repeated over & over & over & over. As it stands The Grey is a predictable horror movie shoehorned into a good story about one mans fight for salvation against all odds. Bad movies don't bother me as much as ones like these where the potential is just squandered.Not to mention it frustrates me to no end when someone attempts to disguise a rudimentary action flick as a thinking mans action flick. Who are you fooling???!!! Oh apparently everyone seeing that The Grey is being toted as the first great movie of 2012. What do I know!!,The Grey

Although his accent varies wildly in any given film, irish, Canadian, loose American, English. You name it our Liam seems to nail it...completely by accident of course. This film is no different, accents aplenty. But still accent apart this film is utter tosh. Why does he seem to go for all the dire rubbish out there, maybe he just doesn't care anymore. This film is ludicrous all it is about is a bunch of guys in the wilderness (none can act particularly well) chased by what must be the most intelligent pack of ""wolves"" in history with hyperpowerfull LED lights for eyes, honestly this film is so silly words don't do it justice. I could go on and on about the same old thing.....every 10 minutes we have a ""man bust"" then a ""get friends again"" then another ""clever"" wolf attacks.....blardy blady, blah....ditto for about 90 minutes.

241,robbotnik2000,"Not At All Realistic, but if you Like Metaphors, well....maybe",2,10 March 2017,"I watched this movie hampered by reality. I've actually lived in wolf country, and I've actually been to the North Slope. If you want to watch a movie that is based on the real world, know that the world of this movie absolutely isn't. Without inducing spoiler-itis, I will only say that oil-field workers are people who work well in teams, otherwise they would not be there. If you live or work in wolf country, you will rarely if ever see them. And Alaska has a strong state wildlife department which regulates predator control. Wolvess are typically trapped, not hunted. The wolf lore mentioned in the movie, the part I remember, was not true. What does this movie have to offer, all the aircraft accident realism of ""Flight of the Phoenix"" which while no more accurate than ""Grey"" was a hell of a lot more entertaining. Both ""The Grey"" and ""Flight of the Phoenix"" can be watched through the filter of metaphor. That's where the characters and situations are stand-ins for types and situations which are representative of political situations and moral situations that the writer wants to speak to. When I watched ""The Grey"" in the theater I tried to understand the unfolding situation in this light, and so I was able to get through the movie. In retrospect, this approach did not take. The acting is par. I liked Liam Neeson a lot more before I saw this flick, and his standing has not recovered in my mind in the time since. One thing that is correct in the move and in reality.

242,TheTruthDoor,Great Actors - Terrible Movie,6,27 January 2012,"I am a huge Liam Neeson fan, it would take something really big to make me not like him....and this movie almost did it. How could he have not known during production that this movie was going in a bad direction and not done something about it.Very strange movie, strange in that the acting was first rate, right up there with the best Hollywood films, but the directing and special effects were ""B"" film quality, at best. The audio & visual effects were laughable, I almost walked out but just couldn't do it out of respect for Mr. Neeson's work. And what is with all of these animal lovers saying that wolves were harmed during the filming of this movie, you have to be kidding, the only wolves that I saw were computer effects, very bad computer effects.This movie reminds me of what would happen when a billionaire gives his son's film class $35 million dollars and says ""go make a movie about man eating wolves"".I have a 12 year old son that wants to see this film and I will definitely not let him. There is way too much fowl language, and with grown-up sexual conversations while sitting by a fire. The ""f"" bomb is used almost throughout the entire film for no real reason.If you want to see an exciting thriller about being pursued by a man-killing animal while stranded in the wilderness, rent ""The Edge"" with Anthony Hopkins. I promise it will be money better spent than seeing this turkey.The only demographic I can imagine giving this movie a positive review would be young males that play video games in lew of living in the real world.

243,Gin-ster,"Indie approach, interesting for first hour",5,15 July 2012,"While I did not look forward to watching this film, figuring it was about stranded humans menaced by wolves, cold, etc. and I'd already ""been there done that"" watching ""Frozen,"" I thought it worthwhile to give it a try as it was highly rated. It had ""Indie"" written all over it so that also was a point in its favor as I figured it would avoid Hollywood clichés. On that score, it did deliver as SPOILER ALERT there was no ""uplift,"" no ""nobility of the human spirit"" stuff, and all attempts by the survivors to save themselves were in vain. Struggling continually met with defeat, and any ""good ideas"" soon proved to be bad ones. So the good news is that it did not include any Hollywood corn along those lines, although the dying men's obsessions with their wives and children may, arguably, fit with Hollywood romanticism. Now, the negatives - it was rather boring waiting around for (SPOILER) people to be eaten by wolves, or freeze or starve to death. There was no chance of survival from the very start unless they happened upon a human settlement, in which case it would have been a different movie. So you pretty much have to ask yourself, ""do you want to spend 2 hours waiting for people to freeze/be eaten/starve?"" The whole thing was pretty off-putting, and, to me, pointless even though some here have seen in it ""BIG MESSAGES."" On thinking about it later, it reminded me of some classic Japanese movies (like Ikiru, and Sansho the Bailiff), in which it starts out bad and just gets worse, as if the point is to say ""Life is miserable and struggling is pointless."" This may be a refreshing change from Hollywood uplift but as piece of film-making its odd combination of distastefulness and boredom is the reason I'm giving it a low rating.

244,ashdoc53,Nice movie,7,16 October 2012,"Liam Neeson is a trained killer of grey wolves ; its his job in Alaska to protect humans by killing the grey wolves that inhabit the snowbound part of the North American continent . He's an authority on grey wolves ; he knows their territorial habits , their methods of stalking their prey and can smell their scent from a mile away . All of which is very good---for his knowledge is going to come handy very soon...........Because his plane carrying him and others back to the American mainland crashes somewhere presumably in the northern part of Canada in the middle of nowhere with only grey wolves for company.....The crash kills the majority of the passengers and the entire crew and leaves only 7 of them alive---all males , not a single woman.....And cut off from civilization as they are , no one is going to come to rescue them---as the cliché goes , they have to survive against all odds......And the odds stacked against them are truly terrifying---not only do they have to battle the sub zero degrees cold , but also many of them are wounded . And the blood from their wounds attracts killers from the icy wastes---the grey wolves , who else.....The director creates a world of ice and snow and howling winds in a forbidding landscape where no food is available---and above all , he creates a world of impending doom and death as the survivors themselves are about to become food for the terrible grey wolves . And the wolves are rentless---one by one they begin to pick and kill the survivors . As night approaches , one can see their eyes gleaming in the darkness , watching their prey .Fire is the only thing that can halt them , and that too only temporarily---and the fuel for that too is in short supply..... The remaining survivors do get a macabre revenge as they manage to kill a wolf and cook him for dinner---a dinner greeted by the bloodcurdling howls of the other wolves......Liam realises that they must leave the territory of the grey wolves to escape a terrifying death and leads them towards a river , crossing tons of obstacles along the way . But the more wounded among them slow down , and the grey wolves are ever ready to pounce on the stragglers.....Grief stricken and driven to despair , Liam beseeches god to come to their rescue---and the non existence of god is proved !!! For no one comes to rescue then out of their living nightmare.....So does any one survive to tell the tale of horror and death ?? Go and watch the movie for that.....

245,Matador07,Take another look,8,11 November 2013,"To a certain degree I think that many of the people who didn't like this film missed its point a little, as did even some of those who did like it. Do wolves behave like this? Or even look like this? Absolutely not. But people, that's because they are metaphors here. This isn't truly a tale of man vs. wolf, or even man vs. nature. Its a tale of man vs. life. That's the main character's arc -- he has suffered tragedy, is all ready to give up, and finds the will to get up and keep on fighting through tragedy. That too is why people who didn't like the ending didn't understand the beauty of it. The monsters come for him, he sees his friends killed, he is faced with plane crashes and blizzards and gorges and hypothermia, but he won't quit. In the end the words of his dad's old poem call out to him and he summons the courage to go down swinging.

The cinematography, Direction were par with each other and the story lacked a bit of a enlightenment. If the director was trying to prove a sense of drama into the viewers, then he has failed miserably. The first 15 or 10 mins. immerses us into the films's atmosphere and tries to concentrate on the happenings of some....wolf killers ? I know, surviving a plane crash is not realistic, but it has been done and i even know a event in which a lady survived a free fall from over 100 ft. ( without parachute ). From there the realism is at its extreme. Heart touching dialogues , good acting and an incredible sense of stillness of the woods covered in snow captured by the camera. I don't know much about wolfs so i'm gonna keep it short. As a film, the Grey has definitely impressed me . It is not everyday that you get a film filled with many emotions and character development so quick and successive. The Best moment in the film is of course the drowning scene. Liam Neeson's blandness and ignorance of the reason resulted in the death of his friend and making him alone. Its Film making Parred with extreme fantasy ( Seriously?)7.6 / 10",The Grey
247,pm_unnikrishnan,One of the finest movies ever,10,7 March 2013,"I saw this film yesterday without having any preconceived expectations or notions. I once saw a part of the movie's trailer in TV and thought that it was a sci-fi thriller movie. But after watching the movie for some 30 minutes or so, I knew that it was not a sci-fi movie. But this thing didn't disappoint me at all.The movie starts with Liam Neeson saying that he is an oil worker and helps his co workers from getting attacked by wolves. He is a very sad guy who has some hardships in his life(we are not shown what it is. Maybe his wife's death or his Father's death). He decides to commit suicide but hears a wolf howling in the distance and refrains from suiciding. He along with his co-workers go to their homes in a plane and the plane crashes at Alaska. Neeson escapes along with few others and they start their journey for survival amidst human eating wolves. Slowly, one by one the people get killed by the wolves, until Liam Neeson is left alone. But he believes he can do it alone and continues his journey fighting the wolves.This movie is an excellent movie as far as I am concerned. The acting is excellent. Liam neeson showcased a very fine performance. The other actors too were very good. The camera work and the photography was just astounding. It gives the feeling that you are actually inside the movie, with them. This movie gives a message that we must not stop fighting. Even if we have lost everything, life is meant to be strived upon. We must not give up.Many people have said that this was a bad movie because it fails to show the behavior of the wolves and the correct survival techniques. Well, i don't know about the technical side of wolf behavior and survival techniques. Maybe the makers didn't get it right. But this movie is not completely an action thriller. It is a philosophical movie, with a great message. So I think more importance should be given to the philosophical aspect rather than the technical aspects. Also, I don't think science has been able to study nature fully. So maybe, wolves do exist who are not afraid of humans. Or maybe, humans can exist for more than 3 days in Alaska.This movie is a must watch. It has taught me the lesson never to give up and to never stop fighting.",The Grey
248,UncleTantra,The Grey Menace,3,5 February 2012,"I was drawn to this movie by Liam Neeson, who is often a commanding presence in movies. And, as survival/adventure tales go, it's pretty standard. An ordinary guy, whose Day Job it is to shoot dragons to keep them from wreaking havoc among the tasty human workers in Alaska's oil fields, is depressed to the point of suicide. But something intervenes in his suicide attempt, and he gets on a plane with a bunch of other guys the next day as planned.Unfortunately, the plane crashes, leaving only seven of the guys still alive. For now. Trouble is, they are surrounded by a herd of big grey dragons, who start picking the guys off one by one as they wander away from the plane to take a pee. So Liam Neeson -- obviously leader material because he gets top billing in the movie -- convinces them to head for the woods, where the dragons might be less able to get at them. Adventure ensues, with our hero now fighting for his life the day after wanting to end it.What's that you say? Dragons? OK, ""The Grey"" isn't really about dragons. Insert ""wolves"" above wherever I mentioned dragons.The thing is, it just as well *could* have been dragons. There have been almost as many documented attacks of humans by dragons in North America as there have been attacks of humans by wolves. You can count the number of documented wolf attacks on a couple of fingers. Maybe one or two less for dragon attacks.Although ""The Grey"" is a passable fictional adventure story, I'm kinda offended because it's *total* fiction. In Asia, there are cases of wolves attacking humans. In North America, one or two at the most. It just doesn't happen.But the filmmakers decided that the public *believes* it happens (after all, if Sarah Palin shoots wolves from a helicopter, they've *got* to be dangerous, right?), so they thought, ""Let's make a movie about guys fighting for their lives against a pack of hungry wolves."" They should've chosen dragons. It would have been more realistic, and it might have been a better movie.",The Grey

251,socialmedia-437-956449,Stunning in many ways,8,16 August 2012,"A plane crashes in Alaska; the survivors find themselves hunted by a pack of wolves. It's a fierce battle against harsh nature and angry predators. Ottway's (Liam Neeson) work consists of shooting wolves for the protection of workers assembling pipelines. He describes them as ""men unfit for mankind"". He carries himself with a lot of mystery and darkness and is detached from the rest of his colleagues.The prologue of the film gives us a thorough introduction to the world of Ottway. Through flashbacks, we understand that he has lost his one true love. He is dragging his life in slow steps with the bitter attitude of a man who has nothing more to lose and attempts to commit suicide. At the last minute he doesn't pull the trigger; the sight of a wolf he just shot dying in front of eyes gives him a breath of hope and a philosophical statement on the absurdity of life and death.In one sense this is a typical disaster movie: Ottway finds himself traveling with his co-workers when they crash in the middle of nowhere, in the cold and hostile wilderness of Alaska. Ottway naturally takes charge of the survivors, and like an experienced boy scout gives directions and tips for survival. The others follow out of despair and fear. But what may seem like a classic battle between man vs nature, is upended when they stumble across another major obstacle – of a pack of wolves protecting their territory. They don't want to eat, they just kill to threaten. Ottway, the only wolf expert on board, suggests moving locations towards the trees. They are now exposed to the anger of brute mammals.With nothing but grey and white color palette, and all colors dissimilated, Man and wolves become equal fighters in their endurance. It turns into a rivalry between two species. Action scenes take a conventional turn, and it's not hard to guess who the next victim will be, even if taken by surprise. What makes of the film watchable is the rise of human soul towards spirituality. Their introverted reflections and attitudes is not about survival, but the embrace of a fate they have no control over. It's just a matter of resistance.The trailer of the film offers more blood and suspense to the viewers than we'd expect. Instead, the focal point is on the journey which brings these men closer together and penetrates the superficial persona that Ottway used to despise in them. The more we know about these men, the more similar they all become.The snow and storm scenes were not a cinematic illusion triggered by special effects, the actors instead endured the harsh conditions of filming with -40°C in Smithers, British Colombia. The results showcase a natural and beautifully shot storm.Many might not like the adventurous closure they were expecting from such an action thriller. But I must admit that it is a mature ending, similar to a spiritual revelation. It completes a circle of life and death mentioned in the beginning of the film, and this is clearly why the film might stand out from others similar in themes.",The Grey

253,kikoydaba3,"relentless, harrowing and visceral survivalist film of a man in existential crisis",9,15 September 2019,"Joe Carnahan delivers a relentless, harrowing and visceral survivalist film of a man in existential crisis. Carried by great visuals, compelling character development and moving performance by Liam Neeson, in one his best since Schindler's List, The Grey blends visual story telling and drama about a duel between man versus nature, religious contemplation and self-redemption.Set in Alaska, The Grey follows John Ottway and his band of airplane crash survivors as they flee to safety in the middle of nowhere. Hounded by wolves, the survivors are boxed in as each of them are killed one by one. Their journey fleshes out the moral and philosophical debate presented by the film. At its heart, though, is Ottway's loss of his wife, tying two previously mentioned themes together in this central conflict. The supporting characters further provide perspective that Ottway does not view. Machismo in the face of certain death becomes utterly useless. Some dialogue overtly present an atheistic leaning, but is balanced by characters with deep faith. Ultimately, these are lesser in importance to Ottway and his thoughts. The character growth is done organically that meshes with the moral and philosophical themes. His deceased wife is the sole reason why he continues to live despite a previous suicide attempt and mother nature's relentless attacks. With regards to the ending and controversies in its interpretation, it is the logical conclusion to his arc because what the group thought was they were moving farther away from the wolves' dens, but truly they were moving towards it. Facing down the alpha wolf is Ottway confronting the memory of his wife and final decision about continuing to live.From a technical standpoint, the cinematography is what makes the film great because it complements the mood and characters. Despite the criticism that actual wolves don't actually behave the way the do as presented, it makes for fantastic cinema. The wolves are vicious and portrayed as allegory to nature and death.The Grey is a surprising output from Joe Carnahan and is his best film, to date.9/10",The Grey
254,compi24,"Review Of ""The Grey""",10,28 January 2012,"""The Grey"" is a 2012 movie directed by Joe Carnahan and starring Liam Neeson. The film is about a oil rigging team that tries to survive the harsh Alaskan wildlife after their plane crashes. Let me start off by saying that Joe Carnahan has been a hit or miss director for me. He usually specializes in high octane and stylized action flicks. Movies like ""The A-Team"", and ""Smokin' Aces"" look cool, but they fail to impress me on an intellectual level. Now, here we have ""The Grey"". This movie is a departure from Joe Carnahan's style. . .in a good way. This movie is toned down to a much more believable level and it has substance. A great script that has not only great dialogue and characters, but this movie's script possesses very deep philosophical and poignant moments. I walked into this film feeling that my heart strings wouldn't be threatened. This movie tugged at them up a great deal. Liam Neeson gives the best performance I've ever seen him give. I honestly thought that Neeson would be the typical badarse he's been fond of playing as of late, but his character (and all of the other as well) is so multi-dimensional, complex, and most importantly, real. The soundtrack is as touching as it is chilling. Joe Carnahan proved me wrong. This movie is a phenomenally entertaining, moving, thrilling piece of cinema. I implore everyone to go see it.",The Grey
255,knowyourmovie,Liam Neeson shines bright; the rest of the movie is just all right,6,7 February 2012,"""The Grey"" is one of those movies that polarize the audience and stir controversy. Some people loved the movie ending whereas others hated it. Some people saw the famous three seconds long scene after the credits whereas others did not. Out of those who saw the after credit scene, some people found it revealing and helpful, others considered it unnecessary and useless, yet others thought it was a step in the right direction, but still too short and vague.The ending-related boiling controversy no doubt made the movie promoters very happy. It killed two birds with one stone: made people talk about the movie and made them forget about the movie flaws. In our review, we will try to avoid this trap set by the marketing crew of ""The Grey"". Why put the cart before the horse? We will start from the beginning and talk more about the ending of ""The Grey"" in the conclusion.It all started with a short story ""Ghost Walker"". The writer, Ian Mackenzie Jeffers, collaborated on the screenplay with Joe Carnahan, who also directed ""The Grey"".I have not read the ""Ghost Walker"", but it looks like this short story converted to a screenplay simply does not contain enough substance to fill almost two hours of the intense movie action. As a result, ""The Grey"" has a very strong and impressive start and holds its charge mostly reasonably well for 80-90 minutes or so. After that crucial point, the movie starts slowly but surely going downhill, becoming more and more repetitive, derivative, and shallow and filling the screen time with some dragging action, tiresome flashbacks, wooden dialogs, and quasi- emotional scenes more appropriate for a bad chick flick than for an action survival thriller. Neither Joe Carnahan's mostly solid and resourceful directing, nor the mesmerizing soundtrack, nor the great nature shots, nor the impressive visual effects were enough to compensate for the deficiencies of the script.There was one factor, however, a quite powerful factor that easily pulled ""The Grey"" from the mediocre ""C+"" or ""B-"" area, to the respectable ""B"" level. It was a human factor born in Northern Ireland, UK on June 7, 1952. Of course, I am talking about the one and only Liam Neeson. We often say that Hollywood is obsessed with its hugely overrated ""stars"" who do not deserve all the hype that surrounds them. We even try to calculate their return on investment by comparing their compensation to the financial success of the movies they play in. Liam Neeson is a living proof that there are worthy stars in Hollywood, the stars that actually can single-handedly raise a movie from the dark depth of an obscure mediocrity higher and higher - to the very top, in the shining light of prominence. Liam Neeson is great throughout the movie, but there are two exceptionally difficult from the acting perspective scenes – in the beginning of the movie, and closer to the end, that allow us to experience and admire the sheer magnitude of his talent. The very short scene where a strong, but desperate and weary man cries to God is simply breathtaking. Liam Neeson's exceptional and inspirational performance takes this spiritual struggle to a new level, moves it to a completely different dimension. It transports us from watching an action thriller in a movie theatre in the 21st century to the times of the Old Testament patriarchs; times when Jacob wrestled with God and his groans might have very well resembled Liam Neeson's harrowing roar in ""The Grey"".I think that Henry Cavill should obtain a record of this short scene from ""The Grey"" and watch it repeatedly. If he is asked again to play a strong man who delivers a motivational speech in desperate circumstances, this simple training might help him to produce something decent, something manly instead of that sickening bark of Chihuahua that he delighted us with in ""Immortals"". Now it is finally the time to go back to where we started from – the ending of the movie. Some people find mysterious double and triple meanings in it, others discover all sorts of symbolisms in it, yet others proudly present some Biblical references that are supposedly deeply hidden in it. In my skeptical opinion, the vague ending of ""The Grey"" is more a calculated marketing move than a well thought-out risky decision of a visionary director. To compare it with the famous ambiguous endings of ""Inception"", ""Zodiac"", or ""Once Upon a Time in America"" is not to know the difference between chalk and cheese.I do not want to sound too harsh or discouraging though. In fact, I think that in the age when the unholy legions of popcorn flicks rubber stamped by Hollywood dominate movie theatre screens, Joe Carnahan deserves our praise and respect for his attempt to inject at least some philosophy, psychology, and symbolism into ""The Grey"". Only time will tell whether Joe Carnahan should continue these attempts, or he should focus on what he does best: a pure thrilling action.knowyourmovie.blogspot.com",The Grey

257,januaryman-1,Overlook a couple of things and be stunned.,8,28 September 2013,"The trailers had me expecting a unbelievable survival thriller in which a pack of wolves throws down with the survivors of a plane crash. It turned out to be something much more than that. My wife and I turned and looked at each other as the end credits started roll. We were stunned. The movie was a deep psychological piece that explored the thoughts and actions of men who were staring death in the face. The wolves were less than characters than were the introspections of the survivors.The film, as most works of fiction, required you to suspend your disbelief of some of the elements of the situation and the choices the survivors made. They could have sat in the wreckage and waited to die, but that would have made for a very boring film. Instead we got a film from Joe Carnahan and Liam Neeson, a film that stuns.The animatronic wolves looked less than realistic, but offset that with beautiful scenery and very artful shots. I don't know if the director of photography or the Carnahan is responsible for those shots, but some of them really stood out in their quality. The wolves became the stimulus that forced the survivors into a cohesive group. The survivors each had a story to tell. The telling of those stories is ""The Grey."" I had thought the title referred to the wolves. It did not. I am still musing on what it references, but it was not the wolves.I don't remember if Neeson received an Oscar nomination for The Grey, but his performance deserved one. His character is incredibly complex and he adds depth to every scene of the film.Watch the movie all the way through the end credits. There is a significant shot at their end.",The Grey
258,ocacia,I was afraid I don't know about you,7,27 April 2012,"What Jaws did for sharks I hope this film doesn't do for wolves. Yes, wolves don't 100% behave like that. I am sure those Aliens Signoney Weaver was fighting also do not behave like that outside the cinema either. I am sure the Terminator, outside of the screenplay is a pretty okay guy just making his way in the world. You know what I am trying to say ---It is a film. I.e. in this case a fictional action Hollywood film. Had you seen it at a film festival or an art film quirky joint I would understand the critique. But you know how people are one expert complains about ""wolves do not behave like that"" now every other reviewer must remind us about the little David Attenborough inside of him. But if you read into the subject you will see that wolves do kill 100s of people a year and it was worst in Ancient times look up the record by T. R. Mader, Research Director. In France alone, historical records indicate that between the years 1580-1830, 3,069 people were killed by wolves, 1,857 of which were non-rabid. So please don't use your localized encounters to generalize ""how wolves behave"" Now I will not get into a fist fight defending this film, I liked it in the cinema, might not buy the DVD but another person I went with did not like it.Its an cheap action film which is suspense driven, far from anything which resembles reality. And do not deny the suspense. I have only seen wolves in a zoo and would be shocked if they behaved like that – true. Now beyond that can we enjoy the suspense? Don't tell me with all the junk Hollywood makes that one little issue spoiled it for you. And lets deal with the ending, do all films have to end with an air rescue and a hero flying back tired but savage (like Predator)? Talk about not being realistic. Yet all those crying for realism are all crying about the sudden ending. What did you think was going to happen? I did like the touch with his wife dying because that was creative. I also like how the script developed the characters amidst the dying. Far worst films have been made so I am happy to at least get a few moments of anxiety as I am drawn into a very fictional film. And yes Liam was good also. and to pull off such a unrealistic impractical film does deserve an extra point so from 6- 7/10",The Grey

260,chiluvr1228,Hated it,1,30 January 2015,"Besides hating this movie because of its inaccurate and brutal portrayal of wolves as merciless killers this movie was flawed in so many ways. Plane crashes in Alaska with many guys on board:1. Instead of staying with the crashed plane to have a better chance of being found AND some protection from these wolves, the survivors (only 6) lead by Liam Neeson's character, Ottway, leave the somewhat safety of the crashed plane to go into the stand of trees which are quite a hike away in the blizzard. Stupid plan as they are picked off one by one by the wolves.2. Right from the beginning Ottway is focused on finding food instead of getting some shelter from the below freezing temperatures and blowing winds. Food doesn't do you much good if you are frozen to death.3. Will wolves surround you even if you have a perimeter fire? Apparently so according to this movie.4. Then they proceed to cross from a cliff edge to the trees with makeshift line which of course is a great idea except the wolves apparently can teleport themselves from the cliff to the bottom and the last guy doesn't make it (who didn't see that coming?)He survives the fall only to be eaten by the teleported wolves.5. Another guy has had enough and waits for death by the river while Ottway and the other guy leave him there. WTH? Could YOU leave your buddy to be eaten by wolves? 6. Guy falls in river while being chased by wolves (who magically disappear after he falls in). Ottway also falls in and tries to save him but is unsuccessful. However when Ottway gets out of the freezing cold water, he is not shivering and doesn't succumb to the cold despite being wet.7. He comes upon a clearing to discover he is now in the wolves den. How does he know this? Because there are skulls of dead animals all around. I'm not a wolf expert but I do know that predators aren't going to leave previous kills around to invite other, perhaps, larger predators to visit.8. THE ENDING: Are you freakin' kidding me? Ottway prepares to do battle with the alpha wolf with a knife and broken glass bottles wrapped around his hands. Fade to black......I understand if you actually stayed till after the credits, you would have been privy to another ambiguous scene where Ottway and the wolf are both lying on the ground, breathing. Are they both dying? Does Ottway get saved? I don't care I just wanted the torture to be over with.",The Grey

That's what they had us thinking was going to happen in the trailer. With out that scene it's just a dull life film about a guy who cant fight his demons due to past happens, so the demons eventually find him in the shape of very aggressive wolves. There is one more annoying part of this film. They decide to head towards the woodland area to try and move further away from the wolves territory. Now I dont know about you but every metaphorical childhood story I remember tells you to stay out of the woods because the wolf lives there. Well maybe these dudes should have rememberd little red riding hood and they might have survived.Give it 5/10 and I think I'm being nice.

The story is so artificial it makes the June 1969 issue of the Invincible Iron Man (#32 Where Walks the Weirwolf) look like a Pentagon budget report. Some of the more credibility defying stunts include: Liam Neeson in a 300 mph plane crash into the ice and emerging from the wreckage with a slight scratch on his left hand, Neeson (wilderness expert) convincing his fellow survivors that the best place to avoid ravenous wild wolves is in a dark forest, jumping off 150 ft sheer cliffs, jumping into icy rivers, fighting said wolves with miniature airline liquor bottles.

I had to restrain myself from throwing something at the TV because of the ending. As I said, I like Liam but his talents and execution are no where near formidable enough to rescue this film at any level. I gave it one star for Liam alone, the rest of the film should be in the negative digits.

264,mjhalta,A lister Neeson making B movies,4,17 October 2012,"Liam Neeson has come a long way down from starring in shows like Michael Collins and Schindlers List. This movie makes very little sense and has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. It will not be added to my collection of movies as I really don't want to watch it again no matter how much time go's by. I never really warmed up to any of the characters let alone worried about them being eaten by wolves. For a brief instance I thought that it might get interesting if these lost souls actually used their brains to fight back but no, they just ran away whenever the wolves showed up and whoever happened to be the slowest runner got eaten. Stupid!! Also I do love the thought of Wolves living in their natural habitat and this movie portrays them as man eaters one and all. So don't go in the woods! More stupidity! And my final point is, in a plane load of Red Necks the character Liam Neeson played was the only one carrying a gun, how can this be, this movie was set in Alaska home of Sarah Palin, realistically the guys on the plane should have all been packing rifles, hand guns, mortars, grenades and surely surface to air missiles to take down those nasty leaping Wolves.",The Grey

The first ten to twenty minutes of The Grey is one of my favorite openings I've ever seen. It was beautifully filmed-especially the part when Liam Neeson walks into a bar and suddenly all the sound is blocked out and the camera is focused on his face-it's amazing. Liam Neeson is fantastic in this role. He plays a man who has just lost his wife and you actually believe that he could help save these men. The script was great. When all of the men are sitting around a fire and talking about their family or what they want to do one more time, Liam Neeson has a five minute monologue about his father that's very moving.

266,ItalianBombshell,Best Liam Neeson Movie,8,18 July 2015,"Let me first say this: I love Liam Neeson. Followed quickly by: I'm not a fact-checking, researching, and reporting kind of reviewer. I'm a ""Turn left at the Circle K"" kind of girl. To be sure, if you make a movie where the characters only use last names, and sparingly at that, up until the end...well, no, I'm not going to remember them. That all said, I am a pretty accurate historian. A good witness. A great diagnostician,as was my career before rewiring due to terminal illness at the age of 39 and having the time to actually watch movies. So, really, if you want a factual, researched, cross- referenced review of the film, just move to the next one. This is more for those who want to know what a slightly above average woman may think. Liam Neeson plays this role hauntingly well. I cannot recall ever watching a movie with Liam where the character was so well rounded. Sure, the Taken franchise has developed the Liam lead. But it's 'taken' 3 installments to actually achieve. *See what I did there? Anyway, the viewer realizes that Ottaway is a troubled soul. We get it. We recognize it. We embrace it. OK, bring it on. Attempting suicide before the action even gets underway. As a pretty astute woman, I had it pegged, the relationship, the demise of his wife, the illness aspect. And figuring that key piece out allowed me to feel empathetic toward Ottaway. And, of course, the damn plane crashes. So, here we are, obscure characters, central character, and developing storyline. Cue the attitudes, the secondary story-lines,and the wolves. Like I previously stated, I don't care who has what name. If you died on the plane, buh-bye. This leaves us with the following: (and really, don't get offended, I mean absolutely no disrespect) the black guy, the blonde guy, the Hispanic guy, Dermot Mulroney, Ottaway? Ottoway? And the melancholic observer, Pete. Lemme tell ya, straight off, I wanted the Hispanic dude eaten. His character was one dimensional and such an ass. But, by the end, I was fighting for John Diaz to get on up and try. Ahhhh, ""no mas"". Profoundly well developed and likable toward the end. The blonde, yeah, he really didn't stick around long enough to care about. The same is true of the black guy. The rarified air, hypoxemia secondary to presumed sickle cell, was a great factual touch. But neither character made me feel anything. Their passing was nothing more than a ""then there was 4"" mentality. The 4...now I'm trying here, really : Ottaway, Talget, Diaz, and Pete. These 4 are the core for the story. They actually are the story. Each obstacle, each passing of these 4 make you feel. Talget (Mulroney) was hard for me. I wanted him to make it through. His character want really the reason why though. The fact that he's ""Michael"" from 'My Best Friend's Wedding'...yeah, I'm a chick, so what? Something, deep down wants me to believe that John Diaz made it. We all saw him tap out. But, maybe, ya know, just maybe. I really disliked his character in the beginning. But, I didn't want him to sit on that damn log. The only passing I really wasn't that upset about was Pete. I liked the character, but, something was lacking for me. Somehow, while I was investing in the other men, Pete snuck under the radar. Maybe because the death scene wasn't factual or even probable. Maybe because I just didn't buy in. The hypothermia would strike pretty quickly. I found myself holding my own breath during the scene. I couldn't. Then I tried with each breath Liam gave him and still nope. Not believable. So, OK, bye Pete. John Ottaway is now alone, calling on God to help him. The only thing coming is certainly hypothermia but, no, we gotta have the Alpha. And end movie. Uhh, but, hey! WHAT THE HECK? What happened? Debating the fight with my spouse and we get to the end of the movie. The ""secret"" scene. And I'm no closer to figuring it out than anyone else. I really can't stand it when movie makers do this. But, then again, I suppose they did their job. Because I really want to know that John Ottaway/Ottoway/Ottway,whatever, is OK. Well, on the up side, at least Liam didn't get beat up in a bathroom in this one. Sigh.",The Grey

That has to go to ""War Horse"" by a long shot.""The Grey"" is an engaging tale. Yes, this is not realistic in the sense of a survival film or even as reality. People don't go into frozen rivers and get out of them without a tad of hypothermia. People don't jump off cliffs to escape the wolf pack only to find them waiting on the other side. And people don't leave a crash site to wonder off into an all white wilderness. But suspend your ""reality"" glasses for a bit.I found this film terrifying because I think, the film makers were trying to get to something primitive or primeval in human nature. The actors as well. Liam Neeson, lost his wife to a skiing accident in 2009 and so his role here must be seen as something of a catharsis--like Polanski's ""Macbeth"". The messages throughout the film are all about dealing with death in all its forms. And we are shown many different types of death throughout the film.I usually hate movies like this but ""The Grey"" attracted me because it was not run of the mill. Yes, there are many departures from the real world, but the story was on a higher plane. Suspend belief and enjoy it.

What do you get when you mix a poem, a plane crash and Liam Neeson? Epicness. Neeson has an uncanny ability to take on the role of the average man and show us just how strong we really are. Then again, none of us have the awesome abilities that Liam Neeson has. I really do think he should be Chuck Norris's replacement.After Taken, I knew I could never miss another role by this man. The Grey does not disappoint. Liam Neeson took on Writer and Director Joe Carnahan in what ended up being a great partnership. The writing is realistic. After the plane crash, the reactions of the survivors feel so very true. The movie quickly takes a poetic turn as Liam Neeson delivers a beautiful monologue to a dying man. What develops from the camp of survivors in an incredible allegory. The men start getting attacked by a pack of wolves. Although this starts off as a strange occurrence, it builds throughout the movie. At multiple points you can see the clear similarities between man and wolf— namely the role of the Alpha Male. The coincides are too amusing to ignore.There are minor shortcomings in the movie. It takes on the same cliché storyline of starting with too many characters and killing them off one at a time. As the movie progresses, however, this is explained well and shrugged off. You will also notice that the facts about wolves are being stretcheda lot. In the end, however, it doesn't matter. This movie builds to such a perfect end that even its shortcomings hardly matter.You should see this movie in theaters. For starters, the action plays out much better on the big screen. This is a movie I will see again. Even if you aren't a fan of thrillers, you will enjoy this movie. Too often will a movie like this rely solely on special effects (Transformers 2, for instance).

The film seems like it has been done before, maybe this time just with wolves. If it was a bear or a mountain lion, or deadly cliffs, the story just seems a bit redundant.

272,MC1-Bjornson,Grey Matter . . .,8,23 March 2012,"""The Grey"", Rated ""R"" for Adult Situations, Profanity, Adult Humor, Grisly Imagery, Strong Violence. Running Time: 1hr&57mns.My Take *** (Out of ****) / 8/10 on the IMDb Scale There are certain jobs people look at and say ""How do they do it? I could never do what they do."" I am referring to thankless jobs that involve high skills working in extreme conditions. These workers have limited to no contact with their families. What motivates people to endure these positions to provide for themselves and their families? These are the questions that formulated in my mind as I viewed ""The Grey,"" the latest Liam Neeson thriller. The film serves as a metaphor to the pitfalls of life, the obstacles people endure and how their faith is tested. True, ""The Grey"" is designed as a taut nail-biter with good scares, decent pacing and good drama. But I think there's more going on with ""The Grey"" than what you initially see on the silver screen. For now, let's hold that thought.The movie focuses on John Ottway (Neeson), a man who specializes in killing wolves to help keep the Alaskan oil-drilling teams safe. After he completes his work, he faces much uncertainty about what to do next. The loss of his wife even has him contemplate suicide before he decides that he will fly back home. Unfortunately, a freak blizzard brings his airliner down into the barren Alaskan wasteland.Ottway is stranded with other oil-drill team members who survived the plane crash. They have no heat, no food and supplies are minimal to aid them in surviving the harsh arctic-like elements. They are hundreds of miles from any other human contact. Matters are worse when the group realizes they are deep within the territory of predatory gray wolves. One of the most eerie scenes is when a hand-held torch reveals several pairs of wolves' eyes reflecting in the darkness.After losing team members to the wolves, Ottway leads the survivors away from the plane's wreckage. It's a pilgrimage fraught with strife through the stark wilderness. The elements, group tensions and the pursuing wolves continue to take their toll on the small band trudging through the snow. Desperation is combated by stories and humor, but the severity of the group's predicament is always looming overhead.The group is pursued by the wolves lead by an alpha male. Indeed, a formidable omega wolf tests the group openly around the evening campfire while the alpha watches from out of sight. The outcome of this incident sets the pendulum in motion for the group to do whatever it takes to make it through each minute.""The Grey"" depends heavily on dynamic visuals to make its impact on viewers. It should be no surprise the film is produced by the highly prolific brothers Ridley Scott and Tony Scott. The movies they have directed and now the ones they produce are known for the strong visual sense in telling their stories. Consequently, the Scott brothers' films are not known for having any strong human sentiments. This time, ""The Grey"" is separated from the rest of the pack with a story about fear, faith and, on some level, redemption.Director Joe Carnahan wanted to show Ottway as a man experiencing deep pain over the loss of his wife. In reality, it was only three years ago that actor Liam Neeson lost his own wife to a freak skiing accident. Neeson openly admitted he suffered from a lapse in his own personal faith and he was able to channel that into his role in ""The Grey."" When we see Ottway cursing at God and demanding a response from him, are we watching the character grapple with his dilemma or is it about Neeson's real-life pain? There are moments in the movie containing personal visions, flashbacks, poems and childhood reminders that aid in the acceptance of death and making a stand in face of adversity. The film was screened even by Christian groups with media materials highlighting the spiritual value of the film.Whatever the message, ""The Grey"" is a highly crafted film. The scenes with the wolves are incredibly tense and the characters are as real as they get. If I had to complain about anything, it would be the ending. I do feel the build-up throughout Ottway's odyssey demanded a more concrete resolution. If the audience makes it through the film's credits, there is a ""cookie"" at the very end expanding on the films conclusion. How you choose to interpret the cookie is up to you. I suppose that's where the faith aspect of the film can come in. This is what this movie is ultimately about.I think people can enjoy ""The Grey"" as an engaging thriller that happens to ask its viewers ""what do you believe in to help get you through?"" It's a rhetorical question from the Scott brothers. Goodness knows everyone has metaphorical wolves in their lives that pursue them.Where a person gets the strength to cope with their personal wolves is something best left to people to answer for themselves. Looking at ""The Grey"" from this perspective is like seeing the tip of an iceberg, with so much unseen below the surface. Whoever thought audiences would get a feature like this from the minds that brought us movies about replicants (""Blade Runner""), unicorns (""Legend""), hot-shot fighter pilots (""Top Gun"") and feisty race car drivers (""Days of Thunder"")?",The Grey

But TMG was willing to overlook the obvious flaws and just go along for the ride, er uh wreck,plane wreck. It kept my attention and knocked me out of my seat a few times. I am pretty certain Neeson put in his time on this film in between tennis games and trips to Quick Trip. Neeson could do twenty films like this in his sleep and make us his own dialogue as he goes. But again, I liked it. It was fun. No Oscar for Liam but no Razzie either.The movie is total formula. A bunch of roughnecks from an oil rig board a plane out of the Alaska wilderness. The plane crashes. A few struggle to survive the cold, the snow, lack of food and certainly each other's obnoxious personalities and body odor. Then along comes Taylor Lautner.oops grey arctic wolvesthey just look like Lautner from leftover Twilight Saga clips. The wolves stalk and kill them one off one by one while the men (and I use that term loosely) infight over who is in charge. Many hard glares are exchanged and philosophic references made aboutwellI have no idea really/ This is the kind of film that Richard Widmark and Richard Basehart would have starred had it been made in 1960. It was made to be rerun on rainy Saturday mornings.If you like gritty stories of survival and disappointed the Twilight series has stalled, you may like this film. Try it.",The Grey
275,drfraud-1,Grey will make you feel...grey,6,28 February 2012,"Grey is a perfect title for this movie because that's how you'll fell after watching it. You won't hate it nor will you love it...it will feel grey.Although the storyline is somewhat original, the story development is quite bad. Between the completely useless flashbacks, which really don't lead anywhere, and the constant factual mistakes, the movie just feels like dragging on for two hours. There is nothing particularly spectacular about Grey and though I liked Lian Neeson's character, he just seemed a bit over the top. He acted well and had a few good scenes, but it was just too cheesy at times.The biggest disappointment was the plethora of factual mistakes that would bedazzle anyone who's ever watched National Geographics. Here are few obviously ""duh, facepalm"" moments that I experienced while watching Grey: -Arctic wolves, especially alpha males, are white, not black or grey. Wolves don't change color, unlike arctic hare or fox. -Surviving a plunge in icy arctic waters is close to impossible, especially if there's no fire nearby. No matter how tough and Irish you are. -Wolves are NOT the only predators that hunt for revenge. They hunt for survival and have no concept of revenge. Anyone who's ever read Moby Dick should know what vengeance is a human emotion.Overall, Grey was an okay movie. It's worth watching once, but you'll probably forget about it after a few days. Average acting, subpar plot and character development, cheesy factual mistakes and unsatisfying ending is unlikely to leave a substantial mark on the history of cinematography. Chances are you'll fall asleep too.6/10",The Grey

I stayed with it because i kept thinking the scenario is such that there was a great story in there and it would develop. I wish someone could have rescued me. I'm not sure what was the worst thing in this schlock, was it the ridiculous confused wolf puppets or was it the completely stupid antics of the hero and his mindless followers.These guys had the ingenuity of a drowning blow fly. i mean come on, they had knives and fire! They kept leaving each other alone! This movie was direction-less and the plot was so vague it was like watching the editors off cuts. Oh boy what a waste of money.

277,WilderMovieReviews,A good and very will made film,8,19 March 2012,"The Grey is a film similar to Alive where a plane crashes in the snow, miles from civilisation and the survivors have to overcome great adversity to survive. The difference here is the inclusion of a pack of wolves fiercely defending their territory. Liam Neeson stars as Ottoway, a hunter employed to keep the wolves away from the oil rig workers. When the plane crashes he is one of only seven survivors. His knowledge of the wolves puts him in charge of the group and their survival.This is a good film, the main cast is relatively small and gets smaller as the film progresses. The cast along with Liam Neeson is made up of several familiar faces including Dallas Roberts, Dermot Mulroney, Frank Grillo, Nonso Anozie, Joe Anderson, Ben Bray, James Badge Dale & Anne Openshaw. The performances are good and Liam Neeson is well cast as the hunter trying to get over the loss of his wife. The pace of the film is good, the tension and horror is portrayed excellently. There are quite a few shocking moments that come out of nowhere. The film, shot entirely in Canada, is a visual delight.This is a good and very will made film and I really enjoyed it.But one again my nemesis (a film critic on a UK radio station) struck once more with this film. This is a critically acclaimed film. Most professional film critics rated this film high, but my nemesis gave this a 2/5 stating that it was boring and predictable! I know everyone has their own opinion but boring!? Seriously how can a film with Liam Neeson being chased by a pack of wolves in the wilderness be boring!? OK it was a little predictable in the sense that people would be killed by the wolves, but the way they were was unexpected and shocking. She stated that The Thing was a better snow movie! However she stated that Happy Feet 2 was a better snow movie than The Thing, therefore it is better than this! Again you can't compare Happy Feet 2, an animated film with The Thing, a horror and The Grey a thriller. You have to rate them in their own category. As a thriller this is great. She also stated that after watching this she felt that Liam Neeson's career was on a slippery slope downwards! Sorry but Liam Neeson is one of the most talented actors out there. He is great in this and I feel her comments about him are insulting.",The Grey
278,gimili3979,Very unrealistic film about man and wolf,4,2 February 2020,"The Grey is a movie that does not know where it is going. In a literal sense and film sense the entire movie is lost. To summarize the movie, it is about a bunch of oil workers whose plane crashes in the Alaskan wilderness and have to survive by fending off a wolf pack that is after them. The first half of the film tends to go by quick while the second half starts to drag.Two of my favorite survival films, ""The Edge""(1997) and ""Flight of the Phoenix""(2004) seem to get combined to produce this unrealistic yet philosophical thriller about wolves who hunt humans after a plane crash.From the very beginning of this film, I kept asking myself, ""Do wolves really do this?"" The entire time I watched this film I kept thinking nobody needed to be afraid of wolves because they probably do not do this in real life anyway. After I watched the movie I searched about wolves and realized I was right.The movie has enough action to keep you watching, but you definitely need to suspend reality. Ironically the ending, which many people do not like, is what I thought was the best part of this film. I understood the moral of the story and thought the ending was very good. Then, after the entire credits roll, you get a hint of the Hollywood ending. So like a lot of the film it was hard to understand what the director was going for. I kept thinking, ""Why did the director do that?"" Did he anticipate that people were not going to like the ending to this film?The Grey is one of the most melodramatic and philosophical films about surviving in the wild you can possibly find. The problem is that none of it is real. The movie therefore does not need to be melodramatic or philosophical because there is no reality associated with it to begin with.The irony is that I really liked the philosophical ending.",The Grey
279,angie_l,Anti Wolf Propaganda,1,14 October 2012,"I love wolves, I won't lie. Since I was young I have been fascinated by their beauty. A big problem with the movie is wolves don't attack people. If wolves are approached by humans they run away, they will even abandon a kill. I have even read story of researcher who after the pack left, went in to a den to measure young pups. He turned and was surprised to see the mother watching him closely but still no attack. Why? Wolves don't attack people.The movie begins with Liam Neeson as a sniper who kills wolves to protect workers in Alaska. I had to suppress my urge to scream at the TV. Livestock needs to be protected from wolves but for the most part, not people.Then he and fellow workers are in a plane crash in the Alaska expanse. The movie tries to be a quiet and thoughtful film about life. However, the film becomes so illogical and unrealistic beyond the boundaries of my suspended disbelief. Why would you leave the plane? There are murderous wolves around that are not just killing the crash survivors but toying with them. Also the wolves are horribly fake. Really, they jump across the canyon to the trees? They don't make spears? Neeson wants to make spears with bullets on them? They don't try to make a shelter? A good allegory or metaphor has to hold up on many levels. This is a short story, maybe it is better as a written drama.Verdict, skip this film. On top of being being a horrible misrepresentation of wolves, it is a dull and rather depressing.",The Grey
280,bobkuhl,"Good movie, better story",7,22 June 2012,"SPOILERS!!!! I thought this movie would be a reprise of the ""I have a particular set of skills"" character. I was wrong, and I thoroughly enjoyed this tale. Without it trying to be too deep, this movie does present a number of themes in very thoughtful ways. At the most basic level, it is an action/survival story, a la Naked Prey. There is some unpredictability and surprise as to who dies and when. It is well shot with some beautiful scenery, and it is well paced and exciting. On another level, the survivors' changing group dynamics mirror those of wolf packs. And on another level, it deals with how people, all males in this case, deal with death. Some have to face it immediately, as in the dying, while others contemplate its high probability in the very near term. Ultimately, it is a great story about trying to face death on your own terms, whatever those might be. Some have interpreted this film a la Jacobs ladder- which means early on the character is about to die in some manner, but doesn't. They propose that it isn't until the end of the movie that you realize the character did die, and the rest of the movie that follows his apparent non-death was actually all happening in his mind as he died. I strongly disagree with this interpretation. The main character's wife had died from cancer or some other illness. He was still severely depressed, and suicidal. He almost committed suicide (death on his terms, life unbearable), but did not. The ensuing survival story allowed him to go out on his own terms- fighting ""the last fight"" against a tangible adversary. It is interesting that he was a wolf-killer prior to the crash, his life was almost unbearable without his wife, and the ensuing survival story is just an escalation of what he was already doing, which was bringing him no joy. It was clear that by the moments he spent with the dying wolf he shot that he valued life. The escalation, or change of terms of dynamics, was, on the other hand, going to allow him a resolution one way or the other. The more romantic and logical resolution is that he die. It allows for a redemption of sorts, a going out per his father's ethos. That he lives is more problematic, for he is likely bedeviled by the same issues he had before the accident. Although this is clear now, I was rooting for him up until the last minute, it was only when the screen turned dark that I realized this was the better ending. All in all, it is a good move but, more importantly, a better story.",The Grey
281,starsteamer,Avoid at all costs!,1,21 July 2012,"Maybe Liam Neeson placed the bar far too high with Taken but this is truly a dreadful film. In fact, I can honestly say that this is the worst film I have seen for a while! Starting with a decent premise, the film begins with interesting characters and decent effects. However, it then descends more and more into the realms of the ludicrous and the fantastical where from not even Neeson's brooding acting can save it. The wolves in the film act so much unlike real wolves it would have made much more sense to make them werewolves Dog Soldiers style. In fact, this might have made it a much better movie. This is a film based on an archaic and ridiculous idea of wolves. A world where they still believed in fairy tales and nightmares. In fact, the animals act more like humans in this movie than the actual humans do. I continued watching this purely in the misguided hope that Neeson would not have made a film quite this bad.

284,Jipper2,Horrible CGI and Bad Camera-work,3,17 March 2012,"I suppose I had unrealistic expectations, expecting a kick-ass, action movie in the way of Taken just because of Liam Neeson was in this movie. It wasn't fair to go into this with such expectations. Regardless of my expectations this movie had a horrible opening where I wasn't sure what was going on. They followed that up with some of the most unrealistic looking wolves I've every seen depicted in a live action film. The camera work was also spotty, at times being professionally done while at other times seeming like the Blair Witch Project. Though it's not an original idea, I do love the concept of the movie. The acting was fine as well. As someone who will watch and enjoy almost any movie, the reason this was only a 3 stars to me was the fact that the Grey hit on my only two pet peeves for movies. Number 1 is Bad CGI. I'm sorry but if you can't do CGI well then don't do it at all because bad CGI makes an otherwise perfectly okay movie nearly unwatchable. This is the reason the SyFy channel should not exist in my opinion. Number 2 is shotty camera work. I'm fine with the Blair Witch Project if that's what your movie is based on with camera work but for a movie to offer me professional style camera work then get shaky when the action starts, just pi$$es me off. I understand a shaky camera keeps you from clearly seeing the bad CGI but the bad CGI shouldn't have been there in the first place. Very disappointing.3 of 10 - A couple of overlooked details (quality CGI & camera work) ruin an otherwise 6 of 10 movie.",The Grey

I should have known better ! From the storyline I was expecting it would be similar to the exciting movie called The Edge . Unfortunately The Grey is a dreary, creepy, colorless movie that looks like it was made on a shoestring budget . Liam Neesan heads the otherwise no star cast . Unhappy and depressed Mr Ottway ( Lian Neesan ) is a hired gun who works for an oil drilling company in Alaska . His job is to scare off or bump-off any wild animals that may threaten the lives of the workers . OK ,so now our cast of unfortunate frequent flyer's board an old creepy aircraft that Stephen King would be proud of . The flight is short lived as the apparent iced up wings causes the plane to stall, I guess ? We don't see any good special effects of the plane going down as in Flight Of the Phoenix . Instead we get the "" Shaky Cam effect "" as in the Blair Witch Project to simulate vibration in the cabin . . In the next scene we see the remains of what's left of the airplane scattered all over the snow covered landscape . How 7 people manage to survive the crash is nothing less than a miracle . As expected , the wolves start to move in same as sharks would have if this flight had been over water . One by one our band of unlucky travelers get picked off by the marauding wolves in some truly frightening scenes . The volume is turned up high so when the wolves growls the audience gets scared out of their seats . The close up scenes of the big bad wolf are almost comical . It is quite obvious they used fake looking stuffed animals for many of those scenes . As expected the wolves begin to whittle down the survivors one by one . There are no colorful shots of the landscape . Everything is bleak and colorless . Many scenes are filmed in black & white . At nearly 2 hours this movie is at least 20 minutes too long . I felt myself dozing off . The final climax between sole survivor Ottway and the wolf is disappointing . The movie goes black as the credits start to roll . Most of the audience exited in disgust . I waited a few minutes to see if they were going to continue the grand finale' but not wanting to be the last one in the theater , I left too . I assume Ottway became lunch for the hungry wolves ? ... The Movie The Edge had style , a good subplot, top notch actors , great cinematography, and a real bear that was one heck of a good actor ! The Grey is a so-so horror film that is only worthy of seeing on your TV . .. I give this thriller only 4 stars . Not-So-Hot .....PWH",The Grey
286,bartom-612-185848,"Movie promises to be a lot more, but stops half-way",6,2 August 2015,"I just feel this movie has bitten more than it can chew. The movie is a roller coaster of emotions and the lows are really low and boring. But lots of good factors to consider. The actors: Each of them have given their ace performance. I was hoping i would only care of Liam Neeson, but no, everyone in this movie has come good and that makes it a complete package of inclusiveness with audience (4/5)The thrills: Granted, the first appearance of the wolves, as seen in the trailers was scary but again the scene was stopped just there and nothing dramatic happens which one might expect, a let down. Other thrills with the growling and howling was not scary, it was very much like watching Animal Planet instead of wolves hunting other animals it was hunting humans. (1/5)The plot: Very weak and predictable, The movie starts with the freezing temperature which is potent enough to kill someone, then wolves, then some treacherous escape plans, and emotional breakdowns, NO, if only it had stuck with one of these and had done a detail job in how they survive i would have been throughly enjoyed (like Cast Away), the movie fails in that and in the end you don't actually have a memorable scene. (2/5)Surival strategy: Very thin, so you run from the wolves, that's it? no clever killing mechanism, nothing? that's just dumb luck and not intriguing enough. (1/5)The weak point: The flashbacks The movie cuts back and forth in Liam Neeson's past and present life and you lose the thrill from the beast that is haunting the pack. It is just like entering a Spa session in the middle of a Marketing Meeting with the CEO. And the movie run time is way too longAll in all th team comes across wide range of peril and survive just by sheer luck, which is not a survival instinctive movie.

But this one people really was moved. I actually went downstairs in front of the auditorium doors waiting for these people who stayed through the credits to exit today. I wanted to see the look on their faces. Many I can see did a good job wiping or hiding their tears and emotions.Now you ask, why did it elicit such strong emotions. Some may disagree, but I believe it is the powerful ending(which I will not spoil). In my opinion the rest of the movie is so-so with a few good scenes but the ending was what really did it for me and so many others.

288,daviddaveinternational,Lame,1,17 February 2012,"First off, if you are going to see this movie in a theater, bring earplugs! I don't know if it was just the theater I was in, but this movie was so loud as to be distracting. Keep in mind, I am 40% deaf in one ear and 45% in the other. Way too much sound effects. If a man falls down a tree in the forest, does he make any noise? Just wait! Seemed to take about 30 seconds too long to fall. Good thing there were no ugly branches in the tree. The dude was ugly enough. He hit 'em all! Every branch he hit broke off, too. Which is impossible unless he weighed 2,500 lbs. (branches cut w/a chain saw if you look closely) I had a feeling it was going to be a stinker movie from the point in the bar where the bartender pretends to fill a glass with beer that is already full. One summary here claims all the wolves were real. They were all computer animations. Eyes will not reflect yellow from a small fire at 50 feet. The eyes had this mysterious power to turn on and off, too. I have flown a lot and any aircraft, without turbulence is rather loud inside. This plane, w/o turbulence was almost dead quiet. Then, the turbulence. LOUD! WAY too loud. Shake the camera for effect! Every time there was any action, it was LOUD! As for the ending...WOW! Dead silence in the theater. I was kinda angry at the ending (or lack of it) How about them dragging the transponder with them? How is any rescue possible if they keep wandering through forests? I wondered why they left the plane in the first place. ALWAYS stay with the wreckage! Where do wolves like to hang out? In the forest! Sure, they might have run out of seat cushions to burn, but, how about a firewood run? Enough about this movie. Good movie for kids if it wasn't for the ""F"" word. Adults? If you look past all the silly fakeness of it all, go for it. You might like it. Just bring earplugs. Also, what's the deal with ""Movie starts at 1:05"" and I had to sit through at least 4 car commercials (all Jap and Korean cars) other movie previews, soda commercials, junk food commercials and other crap?

289,moviefreak2010,Joe Carnahan's best since Narc,10,28 January 2012,"I've been a fan of Joe Carnahan ever since I rented Narc on DVD from my now closed video store. Narc is one of the most underrated films of the last ten years. Containing Ray Liotta's best performance ever and the fact he didn't get a Oscar for it boggles me. Carnahan created a film that was intense, raw, and had emotional depth. Then he made Smokin Aces which I liked as well. The A Team I have yet to see but very much want to. With that said, it seems that with The A Team that we were seeing what Carnahan was building his career to. Leaving the dark edge thrillers for campy action films (which I have no problem with). Then he makes The Grey which I saw the trailer and thought it'll be okay. This movie caught me by complete surprise. The dark edge Carnahan returns with a vengeance with The Grey. I won't describe the plot because it is about as simple as you think. However, good films can be made from a simple plot, it takes good writing. Carnahan is a good writer and you can see that in the film. You actually see men talking to each other that we could all relate to as opposed to them saying dialogue that would only carry the plot along.The performance by Liam Neeson is a little different from his actions roles like Taken. I'll even go as far and say that this film is better than Taken. I love Taken, don't get me wrong, but this film would only worked if we can cared for the characters and not depend only on action. The film delivers that in a basket for you.It's very suspenseful as well. What Carnahan does brilliantly is that we never, not one do we see the wolves from their POV. Instead, we stay with the seven men throughout the whole movie. Every jump scare in this works because of both good direction and no music is in it that can indicate when the attack can happen. In fact, I haven't see a film that had done that sine John Carpenter's The Thing. The wolves could attack at any point of time in the film and you are on edge throughout the film. We need more directors like Carnahan, sure he ain't no Scorsese or Kubrick type but films like The Twilight Saga and Transformers 3 make me stop caring for current movies. Carnahan shows that we can still make very good action thrillers if we took the time and actually develop them. If Transformers 3 was the worst experience I've ever had, this was the best experience next to The Dark Knight. Oh yes, I went there.",The Grey

There's really no originality anymore. That alone makes this a breath of fresh air and soothing. I haven't seen a movie this unique in 10 years.

292,rumbleinthejungle,Survival tale goes against the grain,7,4 March 2012,"I'm surprised to see the number of negative reviews here and also surprised as to the number of comparisons to Lee Tamahori's 'The Edge'; a completely different type of film in my opinion despite the similar locales. Unrelentingly bleak with almost no glimpse of warmth ( both literally and figuratively!) during the whole running time it's easy to see that this film will not be for everyone. The absence of a heroic ending and the depiction of the absolute fragility of man (and futility of machismo) will also serve to divide audiences even further. But, if you can get past these things and can overlook a couple of plot points that might seem illogical you are in for one heck of visceral cinematic ride. The story is simple - Liam Neeson is a distraught widower contracted to shoot Wolves in the Alaskan oil fields. On a flight to the mainland for R&R the plane goes down in the middle of nowhere and he and six other passengers are the only remaining survivors. The motley group must contend with a grim situation that see's them dropped in a freezing barren wasteland with no food, shelter or weapons and a pack of hungry Timber Wolves keen to pick them off one by one. I liked the AO Scott review for this film in which he pointed out that the film posed and answered a number of theological and existential questions in a very quiet and dignified way. Quite un-Hollywood. This is no Tom Hanks picture and unlike the aforementioned The Edge it's never for a minute considered an option for the men to make a stand against the Wolves in the way that Charles and Bob did with Bart the Bear in that film. They are completely at the mercy of the environment and it's predators whilst also being aware of the increasing futility of their plight. The film goes against the grain right from the outset and it's a stylistic decision from the creators that simultaneously elevates it above many of it's counterparts but also probably limits it's broader appeal - an early scene immediately after the crash where Neeson comforts a dying man is one of the most powerful and beautiful pieces of acting I've seen in recent years. To summarize, I found the film a very intense watch and it stayed with me for long time afterwards. Surely the hallmarks of a great picture?",The Grey

It's also got pseudo philosophy and convenient/stupid plot points. E.g. of all the places in all of these wild frozen woods John Agua ends up in the wolves den.

Moody, intense and as bleak as the snowy wastes this movie is set in. Having him play a widower gives Ottway sharp edge of realism - for obvious reasons. The cinematography gives viewers a real sense of the group's isolation and desperate situation. I thought the plane crash was particularly well directed. Okay, now onto the not so good points. Mixing philosophy with action was never going to be easy, but when the roughnecks take (frequent) breaks from fighting the wolves for existential heart to hearts the film does stumble. This isn't helped by the pedestrian dialogue or sketchbook supporting characters. As they die one by one in increasingly depressing ways, the film's central message seems to be that life is painful, pointless and God doesn't exist.

The Grey is a truly moving and emotional picture and in my opinion one of the best of 2012.The Grey tells the story of a hired gun in Alaska heading home with a loud bunch of oil workers on a small plane. The story kicks off from there as the plane crashes in the middle of the wilderness and it is up to Ottway to lead them to safety.As if things weren't already bad know the group is being stalked by a vicious pack of wolves.Instead of being a straight shot of action the story lets the audience spend time with the oil workers,when they are laughing so are you, when they are scared so are you, so when each character meets their fate, you feel worried and sorrow when they bite the dust.The problem I hear most people complaining about is that this film was advertised as an action film, Liam Neeson V.S Wolves,I can see how the trailer advertised that but I was still satisfied with the movie I got.If you like movies that make you think and play with your emotions,see this flick.If you were hoping for a straight up action flick you might not enjoy this one. 4/4",The Grey

298,keith-w8888,Demonizer,2,22 June 2012,"Stephen Spielberg regretted making Jaws because it demonized sharks and this is no better, why does Hollywood not learn from its mistakes? Body count movies were more or less banned after 911, fair enough, but this type of movie should be banned for the unnecessary ill feeling that it causes towards an endangered species, an innocent, beautiful, sensitive, intelligent, endangered species. They are not the ruthless, brutal, stupid killers portrayed in this movie, that's us, the human race, we're the ruthless, brutal stupid killers. The acting is good enough, casting is good enough, but the special effects that portray the wolves are so bad, simply every detail is wrong, fur colour, eye colour, noises, behaviour, everything is wrong. The plane crash, on the contrary, demonstrates an amazing degree of research, knowledge and realism on behalf of the director, but otherwise, this is like a throwback to the cowboys and Indian movies of the 1950/40's. If this amazing creature subsequently becomes extinct let history hold the creators of this movie responsible for presenting them in an untrue, unflattering and inaccurate light.",The Grey
299,dbryn,"The title, ""The Grey"", sums up how I feel about it.",6,22 February 2012,"Interesting... I can usually spot a lemon of a movie better than most. I really wanted to see The Grey, but it was my wife's turn to choose and we saw War Horse. Happy she made that choice! I saw The Grey in what appeared to be a sure winner, but I was disappointed.I felt that so much more could've been done with the movie for much less. I agree with some of the other reviews, that keeping the movie simply about survival was all that was needed. There was no need to further build depth in Liam Neeson's character, in fact it slowed down a thriller.Secondly, the wolves were ridiculous. The circumstances and the plane crash were believable... then they spend how much money on using over-the-top CGI on what looks like something out of TWILIGHT??? One needs only to watch 20mins of National Geographic footage to see how wolves behave when feeding and how they attack their prey. The wolf scenes had some pretty cheesy special affects, in my opinion, and at that point I spent more time ridiculing the creatures than actually being terrified watching the movie.If the producers had taken more time to focus on survival and had taken a less from the makers of ""Open Water"", this easily could've been an ""8"" instead of a ""6"".On a final note... I have no idea how Liam Neeson's 'method acting' of eating wolf meet prepared him for this role. If that's true, it's pretty ridiculous.",The Grey
300,kos-27,Into the fray,8,17 May 2012,It becomes clear very quickly that Grey is not a simple action movie and that its plot derives probably from a short story. It's a philosophical allegory about life illustrated through an action plot.The men on the plane stand for all people. The wolves stand for the obstacles that are imposed on us during our lives. They won't go away and we will be constantly challenged to come to terms with them.We are born and we die and in between we wonder what's important in life and how to live it without fear or regret. We are presented by possible answers throughout the movie: Give in...kill yourself...hang on to your beloved...fight until the end.The poem written by Ottway's father is the key note of the movie: Go in and fight as if it was the last day of your life. At the end Ottway does exactly what the poem says. Whether he survives or dies we don't know but it's not important because the way (life) is the goal (purpose).This philosophy isn't everyone's favorite but it's certainly a possible and valid view on life and more realistic than many others.It's not important if the wolves are «real» or if the dangers are depicted realistically. The question is if the allegory disguised as an action movie functions as a hole and the answer is yes. Apart from that it's not any less realistic than any Bond movie.Liam Neeson is very authentic in this movie as is the whole cold northern landscape and atmosphere. There are some lengths but all in all it's an entertaining movie that makes you think.,The Grey
301,rraa-dd,"Very poor, only enjoyable for a specific group of people",3,11 February 2012,"I had mixed feelings before going to see The Grey. I had read the movie description and in all fairness 'a few men stranded in the middle of nowhere and wolves hunting them' really did not sound appealing in the slightest. But then the cast did include the usually brilliant Liam Neeson. The reviews on here were also very positive. It was actually a friend of mine that wanted to go see this and wanted me to come along. I thought, why not, it would make for a fun night out at the cinema (we went to a late viewing).Unfortunately, my original fears of what the movie would turn out to be were confirmed as I watched the movie. I will start by listing the positives.Well, there are not many. I watched the movie in the cinema and the sound effects were fantastic, it genuinely felt like I was experiencing it myself. Some sudden, unexpected horror-like moments (I do not want to spoil these so will not go into detail) were also pretty scary and therefore impressive.However, a movie cannot be enjoyable just due to its sound effects. The Grey has many negatives. The biggest one is that it is extremely boring all the way throughout. There is a lot of sitting around, thinking about what to do for far too long, talking about boring things, and then there is the seemingly lately popular theme of the main character having flashbacks of his wife. All that is extremely boring if the viewer hopes to see action. People who are interested in slow drama stuff might enjoy this.Character development is fairly poor. You only really engage with the few that are left towards the end and to be honest they are not really likable. Another problem with this movie is its predictability. Once again, I will not go into detail but if you see this movie you will understand what I mean.Dialogue is just irritating. It is as if the characters are attempting to break a world record of swear words uttered in the shortest possible amount of time. I understand that this was an attempt to make it realistic, what with the characters being men that we should not expect a lot of good manners from. However, it just becomes slightly irritating and I would prefer the characters to act as if they are not really that scared of the situation (and perhaps have interesting conversations?).The plot itself seemingly has several holes that leave the viewer questioning a lot, but I guess this is down to an individual's opinion about what could/should have happened. Apart from this, there is hardly any originality or any intrigue in it. In a movie like this it would have probably been better to have a less known actor playing Liam Neeson's role, because at the moment the movie quite literally screams 'this is a poor movie that we attempted to save through having Neeson in it'.Overall this was not a pleasant experience. There are many much worse movies that I have seen and The Grey is not really that tragic given you have low expectations, however I was falling asleep towards the end of the screening. A 3 out of 10 and that is mainly for the sound effects. However, I would recommend that if anyone has the opportunity to see this movie for free/cheaply, then give it a go, as it is the kind of movie that could appeal to different people.",The Grey
302,ginobean,depiction of wolves seems unrealistic,3,13 May 2014,"About 15-20 minutes into the movie, it seemed to me that the depiction of the aggressiveness of the wolves toward the humans was unrealistic and not believable. Just did a 5 minute Google search which confirmed my suspicion that the movie did indeed portray wolves in an unrealistic and unbelievable manner.Humans are apex predators. Animals that attack humans generally either get hunted down either individually or their entire group(s) are wiped out. As a result, most wild animals, including wolves are generally fearful of humans.I found the unrealistic depiction of wolves to be a significant turnoff as it fatally eroded the credibility of the story. Perhaps one way that the writer might have been able to salvage the story is if he/she made the wolves into supernatural creatures instead. If the writer didn't even take 10 minutes to research whether it was even credible to have a murderous pack of wolves, I am guessing that the rest of the script probably suffers from other credibility, accuracy issues as well.",The Grey
303,gigadragon12,The Gray shows a profoundly deep emotional story; and then wolves attack,7,4 February 2012,"The Grey is a survival-action movie focusing on the story of a group of plane crash survivors in the middle of an Alaskan wasteland. The men are all oil drill workers – rough neck manly men that live on booze and manual labor – with the seeming exception of Ottway (Liam Neeson) who is a sniper hired to protect the drill workers from attacks by the local wildlife. Shortly after their initial efforts to survive the plane crash, they come into contact with a group of timber wolves who attempt to thin the men out one by one. The men soon realize they'll have to keep moving to survive, meanwhile the ever present threat of wolf attack surrounds them and clouds their hopes of surviving the menacing land.Meanwhile, counter-point to all the surface level plot development, Ottway has dreams of being with his wife. These dreams present an emotional story to The Gray that adds more depth to its character than other aspects of the movie. They are the reprieve in a cold and snowy roller-coaster.The Gray is one of those movies that you don't really see all that often. It's what I like to call a movie with a conscience. By this I mean that the movie doesn't seem to neglect the fact that its characters are actual characters with other motives and emotions that clash with the story. While these men want to survive the wilderness and beat the wolves, they want to do it because they want to get back home to their families. When the movie slows down for these moments, you get a feel for the character's individual stories. Each character has traits that make him recognizable.The characters themselves are somewhat lacking. Each character has their particular trait and they don't really fade from it. The religious guy stays religious. The ex-con stays the ex-con. The survival expert stays the survival expert. The characters aren't the most fleshed out, but the movie isn't lacking any of the cast that you'd expect to see.That being said, this movie has an extremely annoying motivation to slowly kill off these characters methodically. It feels as if you could run a stop watch and know whenever someone else is about to die. They also happen to put quite a bit of the wolf attacks in the middle of dramatic character scenes, somewhat robbing the emotion of the moment just so they can remind the audience that there are wolves in this movie.The actors do a fine job representing their characters for what they are. You can't take away from anyone here, though Liam Neeson's Ottway being the main character is the show stealer, all the other men maintain a presence even when it does feel like there are too many of them immediately after the crash.In fact, I would say that the main detractors for this movie are rather prevalent even in the trailer. The trailer starts by showing emotional moments and the crash and the set-up and all, but then it gets distracted by action in the second-half. That is pretty much the story of this movie. While there is a great emotional depth that is played at and used to pull on the audience heart strings, we don't ever get to feel it as much as we should because the movie is too busy trying to remind us that Alaskan wolves are bad asses. We don't get the time or space we need to breathe in the emotions, to truly connect to the characters.Finally, during the last scene we are presented with two twists that change the plot (sort-of) and one of these I feel was completely obvious. Maybe I'm just really damn good at guessing plots. But this is actually one of the best scenes in the movie. In fact, despite knowing this twist and having accepted it as a general part of the story, I was rather emotionally affected because of it. I didn't blubber into man tears, but I did go into ""blink your eyes really fast so you don't break down into man tears"" mode.For a final say, The Grey is a movie that wants to be deep and emotional, and for two scenes it manages to capture this perfectly, perhaps among some of the best emotional scenes in movies. However, it's emphasis on the wolf-attack plot line, and a lack of creativity on pushing the characters forward without this plot line, make it so that whatever connections I feel on the edges of the movie, I feel like I'm being steered by the nose elsewhere in the movie.The Grey is a story of what a film could've been if it hadn't had to be an action movie.For more of my writing, visit: http://expositoryconundrum.wordpress.com/",The Grey

Sure, make firewood runs into the woods during the day, but...weird. NEVER leave the crash site. It's common sense. The ending is the worst ending since the ending in Dutch Treat.

305,jacco59,Survival combined with monsters: It works!,8,13 March 2012,"Obviously you can't really watch this without thinking of 1993's Alive, but really, aside from the plane crash and the struggle for survival, this is a completely different film. The basic story: Liam Neeson puts in a great performance as the cold-blooded but good-hearted protagonist, who leads a group of seven (that's himself included) plane crash survivors through the harsh plains and forests of Alaska. Even before they embark on that journey one of them is killed by a vicious (and very large) wolf. During the journey they are killed off one by one (this sounds like a horror film, but it really isn't) by that pack of wolves until just Liam is alive at the ending, which will frustrate you (but I won't tell why).This seemingly basic story is enhanced by great acting from all the actors, especially Nesson and Grillo, and by the amount of background information we get on the main character. That last thing really makes you feel sorry for him and the hard life he's had, and helps give this film that little bit extra to turn it from a good thriller into a great one. Because that's what it is. Great.",The Grey
306,CaptMTS,Gritty Survival Film with Some Good Performances,7,4 February 2012,"The Grey presents the struggle of the survivors of a plane crash in the Arctic facing nature and some bloodthirsty wolves. The Grey is heavy on the dramatics and loose on the realism, but the film is tense and suspenseful through the end.The acting overall is very good. Liam Neeson does well in the lead. He is a strong force in leading the survivors, though he himself struggles with his inner demons. Frank Grillo does an excellent job as an angry loner who lashes out to hide his own fears. The others in the small band of survivors were very good in their desperate struggle.The director does a great job capturing the beauty and harshness of the Artic, and he effectively moves the survivors from one challenge to the next. He captures their raw emotions - fear and desperation - that overcome the characters in their harrowing predicament, as well as their brotherhood in facing their likely fates.The film is hurt by a lack of realism in several instances, which stand out in such a ""realistic"" survival film. The wolves' behavior in many instances is far-fetched, as the director can't resist humanizing the wolves. And, the survivors have an amazing ability to survive freezing temperatures, including falls into ice cold water without suffering hypothermia or death.The Grey is a worthwhile movie to enjoy at a theater for the tense survival drama, beautiful scenery, and strong acting. You just need to suspend belief in many instances.",The Grey
307,ftyl,A survival thriller classic in the making,9,31 January 2012,"Director Joe Carnahan made everyone sit up and take notice with his blistering theatrical debut Narc in 2002. Coaxed into screens with help from Tom Cruise (who was one of the 20 plus producers on the film), it was an improbably gritty tale of a broken narcotics officer played by Jason Patric who comes up against more than he bargained for during the investigation into the death of a fellow policeman.Carnahan seemed destined for the Hollywood big time, moving into pre- production on Mission: Impossible III with supposed buddy Tom Cruise but he soon left over creative differences. The director eventually returned to theatres with 2006's Smokin' Aces – a ridiculously over the top action film with few signs of the filmmaker who brought us Narc. And The A-Team has its moments, it seemed like the subtleties of the director had become lost in blockbuster filmmaking.Well Carnahan fans, fear not. With The Grey, he's back and better than ever.The film succeeds thanks to a masterfully wrought script from Carnahan, which is based on a short story by Ian Mackenzie Jeffers, who also contributed to the adaptation. The film pits lead character Ottway (Neeson) against the trials of the weather and the landscape and the horrors of a pack of ravenous wolves but also against himself. He has taken a job at the end of the earth, surrounded by the dregs of humanity, and feels like this is just the kind of hell he deserves. Ottway accepts his new situation with resignation and almost recognition. The wolves are a real adversary but also, fundamentally, represents the personal demons the character has been trying, and failing, to face.Carnahan takes what could have been a staid action B movie with stock macho characters and forces the audience to see them as people. Sometimes bad people yes but human beings nonetheless who have a right to live one more day, even if its just to spend that time drunk or wallowing in whatever defective life choices they have made. He makes you feel each death in the film, feel the loss of another valued life.An early moment sees Neeson's Ottway comforting a mortally injured man after the plane crash. It's a moment of total compassion, giving the dying man a glimpse of better times as his gore streaked hands search frantically for some contact. And he finds it, in the grip of another survivor. It's a simply stunning moment, something unexpected and powerful and makes the mention of an Oscar nomination for Neeson far from laughable.The Grey is shot through with touches of startling subjectivity, lead by Ottway's frequent voice over. It introduces us to his world and makes it clear that we're experiencing everything from his perspective. This also gives Carnahan the chance to toy with some arresting imagery, like Ottway's wife lying next to him on a bed of snow, a recurring visual motif that keeps the character going, alongside a letter he has written to her. The character keeps it as a talisman, as a chance for reconciliation, of a life beyond this current circumstance and it serves to make us all the more hopeful of his survival.Neeson is on top of his game here, unhindered by even a whisper of an accent, he digs deep to bring out the complexities of a man who has given up on trying to live a good life. His physicality is a boon as well and his worn and functional hands a constant feature – weapons and tools of survival. He may carry most of the dramatic weight of the film, but his supporting actors are uniformly excellent. While the dialogue sometimes falls into repetitive macho territory, there's depth to every major character, with Dermot Mulroney and Dallas Roberts doing solid work. Most memorable is Frank Grillo who had a small role in last year's Warrior. Here as Diaz, he takes what could have been a stereotypical semi villain and crafts a tremendous arc for the character.Carnahan is intent on providing more than a mere action movie with The Grey but doesn't completely shirk those responsibilities. Everything from the bone-jarring crash to the finale is handled with a gritty attention to detail and some fast but never confusing editing. Set pieces occur infrequently and lack the bravura of blockbuster films but it's that intimacy which makes it all the more engaging, even terrifying.Strangely enough, it's with the wolves themselves that The Grey almost falters. Brought to life with a mixture of animatronics and CG, they often looks less than convincing and are used far too often throughout. A handful of CG sequences are effective, and there's menace in the physicality of an on set model but these enemies are at their most terrifying when they're unseen – like a nocturnal cavalcade of howls, etched only in half seen plumes of lupine breath.But it's a minor issue in a film which does so many things right. The Grey is possessed of a bleak beauty, projecting the chill of the Alaskan wastes right into the theatre. It is bold and brash and macho, while also presenting moments of powerful emotional weight and even addressing themes of spirituality and the constant closeness of death. And the ending, when it comes, is mere inevitability, coming to a head in a burst of finely wrought lyricism and an indefatigable drive to live just one more day.",The Grey

But this still doesn't make it good when it is basically a dumb unrealistic horror movie with wolves. These creatures do not behave at all like real animals, they are more like horror movie monsters, which for some unexplainable reason decided to hunt these humans in a green forest teeming with wildlife. Just when I thought thanks to the works of Shaun Ellis (see his 2007 documentary The Wolfman - not to be confused with the boring horror from 2008, The Wolf Man) and others we finally dispelled the unjust image of the wolf from the mind of the common man, along comes this dumb horror/thriller movie with animals who have no self-preservation and act more like the raptors from Jurassic Park, IE needless putting themselves at risk to get at morsels when other food is available. Wolf packs hunting humans is all but unheard of, the few wolf attacks that do happen are usually cased by solitary, weaker wolves, and even those will not attack unless they are starved or attacked themselves.

So eight people survive a plane crash, OK we know this can happen because of the film alive which was based on a true story. Normally there are no more than fifteen to twenty wolves in a pack, I'd say there was 30 or so people on the plane 23 bodies for the wolves to feed off. Normally wolves would scavenge before putting themselves in danger like many other predators. The scent of dead bodies would have kept the wolves where they were. I'd imagine if people were being hunted down then in the open they would have been venerable but surely the would have armed themselves at little better out of that wreckage. Molotov cocktails to burn them would have worked and could have been easily made. There was a scene from Rambo First Blood, amazing how the wolves found a fast route down there, If the were following them. The worse thing was the amount of time Ottway was in the river in sub zero temperatures he surely would have died from hypothermia, especially trying to save Hendrick with mouth to mouth. Also if he had of made it ad dried off which he looked like he had did then in theory the wolves would have probably lost his scent. Therefore would not have persisted after him. If somehow they did catch back up with him tooled up with a sharp survival knife and a knuckled duster of three sharp bottles would have had more than enough in his arsenal to kill the lone alpha male weakened or not.",The Grey

What was the point of that? After their plane crashes, they conclude that their employer used them up, and then threw them away; they don't expect that any money will be spent on a search and rescue mission. What was the point of that? And then, what? They decide that to ""just keep moving"" is a purpose in life? Sparing a few fond thoughts for their loved ones as they move along?

The story is unexceptional in the sense that this is what would normally happen. Yes, the performances are strong. Liam Neeson is as usual excellent, but what's the point? Yes, people are often quite brave in the face of death even when they do not survive. Believe me I've seen it. But the film is unnecessarily negative. We do sometimes triumph over evil.

The first problem was the drunken buffoons representing a crew of oilfield professionals. These are prized jobs in Alaska, and these hand-picked crews are the best from all over the world. Liam Neeson's character says they were a collection of low-life assholes. Second problem was the plane crash. Unless you have something like Lost where there's a mystical force involved, the airplane's black box will broadcast where the crash site is located. Even in bad weather, the site would have been crawling with rescuers within hours. Liam Neeson's character takes charge, confidently asserting they were on their own. They camp outside the wreckage, then leave. Inside the wreckage, they would have been able to stay warm and safe. The final problem was the wolves. Wolves are the ancestors of modern dogs. They respect and fear humans. The giant creatures in the movie are like great white sharks with fur, mindless killers focused on making the crash victims a meal. If you have an IQ of 80 and can get past these insults to your intelligence, you may enjoy this movie. It's not badly shot, and the pacing was fine. Lian Neeson was excellent.

Those are the chilling words from Ottway, Liam Neeson's courageous character,in The Grey.A group of Oil riggers are flying over the Alaskan outskirts when horrific turbulence causes the plane to crash, leaving numerous casualties.The crew of twenty something, cut down to seven survivors, are left to survive in the blistering cold, heavy snow, with a slim chance of finding home. One of the survivors Ottway (Neeson), is trying to get to grips of what had just happened. Considering himself lucky, he is determined to get home safely. As the group of men begin planning a way out, it isn't long before they realize they are not alone. The abandoned scenery is hunted by Alaskan wolves.We soon learn a bit of Ottways past, as we get brief flashbacks, almost haunting images of life back home. His skills are surprising as we learn just how beneficial he could be to surviving the wrath of killer wolves.The Grey is a fantastic survival movie. The horror concept and the teasing plot puts it up their with The Thing (Not the remake!). Liam Neeson dominates his role of leadership. One genius is left questioning Ottways suggestions, in believing if they stay at the plane wreck, they will be found. Ottway tells him ""No one is coming for us! If we don't move, we will freeze to death...that's one thing that will come for you"". Cold, yet honest words from Neeson's character.The movie offers brilliant performances from all the cast, with the vicious wolves looking ever so real. The scenery is quality, both in the haunting night, and day. The viewer is left wide-eyed when you hear the wolves calling for their prey! I was shocked to find the gruesomeness in some scenes, but it suited well to the movies chilling concept. I mean let's face it...the aftermath of death from a murderous Wolf isn't exactly like a poop left un-flushed? This is full on. And it rocks! This will be, surprising to most, one of the best action movies of the year.As for the ending? Of course I won't go into that, but to say this. A lot of viewers will despise it, after such a thrilling beginning. I for one had no problems with it. In fact, I got so much enjoyment from the first 110 minutes, that it just breezed over my head.Did you enjoy my review? check out my previous and up to date reviews at my blog - http://gerrysreviewsforthosecurious.blogspot.com/",The Grey
318,whitakeroh,Deeper movie for the bubblegum masses,8,24 December 2015,"Apparently many IMDb reviewers like all their movies straight without cream and sugar and no deeper meaning. The Grey is fantastic. Period. Yes- the wolves and some of the decisions of the survivors is laughably bad. No doubt. That is really only about 2% of The Grey. It seems that can't be true but if you watch the movie it is.Once more unto the fray is a battle cry that harks back to and is modified from Shakespeare's Henry V. The movie presents a singularly dark world mixed with pain, death, the cold, hungry predators, pointlessness, drowning, etc., but all to help the viewer swallow the carefully crafted dystopia of Neeson's character's soul. This movie is WAY more like ""The Road"" then ""The Edge"" or ""San Andreas""Go see it and look past the first obvious level. If you can pierce the veil, you will see the goodness of this movie.",The Grey
319,andriz,started rooting for wolves,2,22 July 2020,"Cant rate this with 1, because it shows that some of the movie makers have gave their best. Acting and idea was not bad. Psychological credibility, at the plane crash and couple of moments after, was axtually ok.But writing... boy oh boy... Instead of fortifying themselves in plane wreck after first wolf attack, they will stay out. Probably because of excessive heat and comfort indoors. Then they either will fall asleep when taking watches or go to darkness to take a leak, without any given object to protect yourself.Hunter leads people in order to escape wolves from plane wreck to... a forest. At night. If wolves have a den nearby, as hunter dude establishes, where would it be, one might wonder. Well definitely not in a forest, otherwise why escape exactly into it.In addition - why the hell should wolves have a den around overall - those are all overgrown mofos. Grown wolves don´t live in a den, they travel around.Instead of arming everyone and searching for guns, or, at least knives, axes and any given sharp objects like steel rods or whatever to carry along, they are gathering... wallets. For sentimental reasons. Right. When wolves are charging at the open, all the guys... run. Thats the way to beat wolves, who can hunt prey for hours in a speed of 35 miles per hour.Of course... those CGI things are no ordinary wolves, those are AT LEAST werewolves, in a size of a blackbear. Also, wolves don´t act that way as shown in this movie. Vietkong´s - yes. Ninjas, occasional vampire, hungry werewolf - maybe, but not wolves. Wolves are reasonable creatures. They kill to eat, not to terrorize people, entertain themselves and end up organizing grande finale, mano o mano battle between alpha wolf and his prey. They are simply too damn smart for this nonsense.Make yourself a favor, avoid this nonsense",The Grey
320,ClintWardley1,Dumb script by lazy writer,5,5 August 2012,"If not for Neeson, this movie would be ""absolute rubbish, but with his being in the movie it moved it up to ""rubbish"". The problem? The script!! The script writer, Joe Carnahan is also the director, so its all his fault. This guy must be some studio hack, who writes a script without any research into his subject. The actors were great, they tried to bring some seriousness to this boys own adventure but the problem is you sit there screaming at the screen ""You dumb sh#ts don't do that"".As others have stated Neeson's character as a survival expert was woeful, he did and advised others everything that would kill them. The ex-con in the group had the right idea about Ottways(Neeson's) skills and that was, they were stupid. God help anyone who uses this movie as a reference for survival training. Its what not to do in the snow. Anyone with exception of the script writer will tell you the most important thing in snow country is shelter. They had the plane for shelter, they had stuff to burn, they had metal to make weapons. Food? Well good luck to the wolves that would try and attack a fortified shelter or the survivors could have trapped them using the dead bodies as bait for guess what, FOOD. Wolf meat you can eat and after the wolves lost a few of the pack I guarantee they would start to stay away.Finally the survivors were a 1000 miles from nowhere, you cannot walk out, better to stay with the plane, make a signal fire and wait for rescue. You could last for months and not die in days following some suicidal fool hunter who has no idea. Next time Joe, study the subject don't insult us.",The Grey
321,WolfieLol,Liam Neeson´s best film.....Until I saw that awful ending,5,5 September 2020,"This film was really good, it had wolves (my spiritual animal), suspense, snow, a survival experience and of course Liam Neeson, it had everything good to make this film a cult classic...but then...I love the type of endings with certain ambiguity into them, but this was just utter trash, it looked like the director cut the scene just to reserve budget, I was waiting for that fight between Liam and the alpha dog just to watch that stupid black screen and that Post-credit without reason to existThis ain´t ""You Were Never Really Here"" to cut the cathartic violence, this was an action packed movie with everyone hoping to watch that final confrontation that never came.Truly a shame, it ruined my whole experience, I don´t want to watch this film anymore",The Grey
322,KIM_HARRIS,Don't bother,1,13 July 2012,"It's not very often that I give up on a film half-way through, given that I have already invested an hour or so, but I finally lost patience with this absolute turkey of a movie. How Liam Neeson agreed to be in this collection of utter twaddle is beyond me. I don't necessarily expect movies to be completely realistic but this one just doesn't hold together at all. The conduct of the characters is ludicrous, the animal behaviour of the wolves is unnatural, the special effects are poor and the script is ham-fisted with every fourth word being ""strong language"". My advice? Don't waste your time - I wish I hadn't.",The Grey
323,greekmuse,More like a horror movie,6,20 February 2012,"I went to the theater with pretty high expectations based on the ratings and thinking it'd be a thriller similar to Taken or Unknown. To be fair, it's not categorized as a thriller but nor is listed as horror and more than anything else, that's what the film is.The whole movie is essentially crazed wolves going after survivors of a plane crash in the Alaska wilderness. The explanation we get from Ottway (Neeson, who plays his role well), who kills wolves for a living to protect oilfield workers, is that if they're in the range of their dens where the cubs are, they'll attack humans. Even if that's true, I find it highly unlikely they would attack a group of grown men out in the open especially with a fire going.There you have it, that's it: one by one, the men are torn to pieces by wolves until Ottway is the only one left. I was expecting more human-human conflict of which there isn't much, despite a promising start: a good riffraff fight in a bar. In retrospect, the ending is a just ending to the storyline and even mildly poetic.",The Grey
324,My_Opinion-245-920801,The Grey was a survival movie at heart.,9,22 February 2012,"The Grey was a survival movie at heart. What does or what will it take to survive? Are you prepared to make the tough choices or will you allow the deeper sinister part of your personality to surface? Those were some of the questions that were directly answered in The Grey. The adventure starts off quickly and the pace is brisk and attaches itself tightly onto your imagination. Yes, the wolves were super-natural aggressive, but after all we are talking about a movie, not a National Geographical series on predatory wolves. The acting was solid and as always Liam Nelson showed why he is such a good actor, by not only having the lead part, but acting it out as such. You believed that if you found yourself in such circumstances you would want him leading you too. The rest of the cast was stellar; the directing was also up to par.",The Grey

These poor creatures look like a cross between a Shetland pony and a warthog. Plus, they are not grey but BLACK. They look like giant Brillo pads with legs. In any case they are UGLY, which no real wolf is.It's not really a spoiler to point out that the fires seem to burn without people ever putting wood on them. Or that someone falls into an icy stream, then gets up and walks in the woods with wet clothes but no hypothermia. Or that these wolves really REALLY UGLY! So sad.Oh yes, the scenery is beautiful. And the men love their kids.",The Grey
326,electronicparty,Surviving the plane crash was the least of their troubles,6,27 January 2012,"A commercial airplane filled with misfit oil workers who know each other are on their way home from an Alaskan oil field, when the airplane without warning crashes. The survivors must unite to survive the elements and a pack of blood thirsty wolves defending their territory. The characters of course are not without their melodramatic personality clashes which yielded performances that kept my attention. The film was entertaining but not realistic which I expected. A viewer with knowledge of aviation, biology, and survival kills will have to overlook the technical mistakes to enjoy the film. I felt the flash backs of the Ottway's (Liam Neeson) wife was unnecessary. That melodramatic subplot seemed to have been added later after a poor test screening. I got the feeling those scenes were added in an effort to not completely alienate female audience members. Those scenes reminded me of the mirage scene in ""The Flight of the Phoenix (1965)"". The character's dialog is locker room or barber shop profane, guys talk different when women aren't around. The few male orientated humorous moments yielded male audience laughter but silence from the women, if not disgust. I thought the film was completely ridiculous yet I couldn't help but ask myself, ""What would I do if I were in that situation.""",The Grey
327,crberme,Awesome visuals and some clichés but worth watching,7,17 October 2017,"This movie is pretty much what you would expect: 7 men try to survive in the snow after their plane crashes, having to face nature at it's worst.Something that makes this movie stand out is the visuals. Beautiful landscapes and close ups make The Grey delightful to the eye. But, although I liked the movie, it's pretty much a typical man vs nature movie, and brings nothing different to the genre. It's still well done, though.",The Grey
328,gaylord_fokker,Men only.,8,17 August 2018,This film takes you on a journey with pure men with the struggles they experience and the beauty that comes with it.It is not intended as a documentary of wolves.

329,jimanuel12,Not as good as i thought it would be!!!!!,2,16 July 2014,"This was really a disappointment - i really thought from the trailer that this would be a good movie but i was wrong. First of all, the movie depicts that a lone wolf attacks men working on an oil rig, that does not make any sense at all. Ottway (the lead character) is the shooter protecting the workers from these crazy wolves who want nothing but to eat the workers, that is crazy as well. Wolves, from what i understand, do not attack men. The movie has the notion that the wolves are mean, want nothing but to kill the workers and follow them through out the movie. The ending really sucks as well when you are left with the impression that the hero is eaten by the wolves after surviving a plane crash, walking through the snow and leaves you with a really bad taste in your mouth. it just is not as high as the ratings on here gives it. it is OK but not my type of movie for reasons already stated.",The Grey
330,foxtwc,This movie is more about loss and grief and the will to live ... not about wolves and horror,8,20 September 2018,"Too many people approach this movie as a survival/horror film where its all about a plane crash and the survivors to try and win against nature. If that is your only take of the film then you will not be entertained.The entire slant of this movie is actually hinted at throughout but does not become apparent until the last few minutes. That is when clarity ensues and you understand the struggle the protagonist has had through the whole movie. And with that understanding you can take a completely different interpretation of this whole movie than you thought from the outset.*spoliers*The arctic:
This movie is about loss and grief ... a loss so painful that it extinguishes any desire to live. This movie is about moving through life both wounded and lost. Its about the isolation you feel when the person who means the most to you in life is gone and the world doesn't notice but goes on coldly and without empathy for your state of mind or your feelings.The protagonist is in Alaska ... isolated from the rest of civilization ... an outcast among other outcasts. With no one either knowing or caring about his state of mind at the loss of his wife. His struggle with wanting to live is evident as thoughts of suicide plague his thoughts and actions.This environment is a massive parallel to what people who experience a traumatic loss go through .... how isolating it is that no one else can understand the loss. The loneliness ... the isolation ... the lack of contact ... a world that goes on around you but that you are no longer a part of. The plane crash:
An attempt to get back into the civilized world .... fails. A literal crash and burn ... or is it a parallel for people who have lost a spouse or a child that try to reintegrate with the regular world after a period of grieving. You want it to work and hope it will work but everything just fails and you cannot return to the way things were and think of trivial everyday life things as important anymore.The survivors:
Each has a personality ... people lost who are facing adversity and they all react in different ways. Some quit, some fall apart, some sob about the situation they are in, some fight, some are scared, some take time to try and focus and think before reacting.The reality is you become all of these people when you experience a devastating loss ... getting angry, shutting down, wanting to quit, utter sadness and despair, survivor ...Nature:
The b*tch .. she doesn't care that your heart was ripped out of you years ago. Life is rough and full of things that can go horribly wrong no matter how many losses or setbacks you have had. There is no mercy rule in life, losing a spouse doesn't give you a get out of jail card for escaping future losses or setbacks.The wolves to me were just a representation of the grim reaper ... a realization that your days are growing short and death is coming to you soon. Conclusion:
And that is the crux of the lesson for this film ...After loosing your spouse or anyone else close to you ... when you realize that you have to get up and continue with your life ... but are faced with the knowledge that you will die ... how would you choose to live your life. Do you fight to live as long as you can? Do you shutdown and wait for life to leave you? Do you sacrifice yourself to protect others?How will you face certain death ... will the life you have lead after have made a difference to others? Will anyone notice or miss you or even know the life you lived?And so at the last few moments of this film that you realize this movie can be interpreted a completely different way and that is where the depth of it comes in ...Ottway ... a man who lost his wife to disease. Who wishes his life had ended on that day. Who isolated himself to deal with the pain as it was the only way he knew how. Who tried to re-emerge into society to live as normal a life as he could but couldn't. Who is surrounded by people that do not understand why he just can't get over the loss of his wife and act normal again. Who lived his life fighting his own inner demons that were telling him to quit, or to fight or were too scared to handle the hardships of life in a cruel world ... ultimately to struggle to survive and face death standing up with a will to live that he hadn't known or wanted before.With that final understanding this is where the movie changes from survival/horror film to a metaphor for how people deal with loss and grief and survival. A struggle that everyone will face at one point of their lives.",The Grey
331,james-t-sheridan,Liam Neeson vs. The Wolves. Friggin' awesome!,8,13 July 2012,"The set-up for The Grey is classic: oil pipeline workers and their wolf-sniper-for-hire Ottway (Liam Neeson) in Alaska crash their airplane horrifically upon the frozen tundra, leaving bodies strewn across the horizon. Ottway's survival skills make him a natural leader post- crash, with a cadre of cagey characters left to negotiate survival against the elements. All the elements. Beyond the imminent blizzards and subzero temperatures, there are packs of ravenous, vicious violent wolves roaming around the edges of the frame. Big wolves. With sharp teeth. And no fear. There's talk of wolves being the only animals that ""seek revenge"" as well as the danger of being near the den of the wolves (not good). There's hunting and marking of territory. There's howling. There's wolves crushing human faces in their mouths. There's blood. Carnahan's film is swiftly told and executed with plenty of genuine scares and surprises, and the film resembles a shark attack film where you wait for nature to take each character and winnow away the group in unsuspected ways while also containing elements of both The Edge and Alive (I particularly like that one character references Alive at one point). There's a Lost element to the first half hour, with some particularly nasty nihilistic dialogue and jokes as well as the imminent fear of wolf attacks. Always. Wolves are demonic forces in this film, unstoppable and omnipresent, indifferent to the maneuvers of the ever-dwindling pack of survivors who contemplate making a break for the tree line amidst a blizzard. Wallets of the dead are collected for their families. Ottway wrestles with his faith as well as his survival skills as they clash with the elements: thick snow, treacherous cliffs, chilling rivers. And the wolves. Oh, the wolves. Liam Neeson holds the picture firmly in place with another strong, classic performance with gravitas and some seriously emotional catharsis. Has any actor displayed more incredible range of his generation than Neeson? Is there anything he cannot deliver? The list of roles includes Oskar Schindler, the dad from Love Actually, the dad from Taken, Qui-Gon Jinn, Hannibal from A-Team, Zeus, Henri Ducard in Batman Begins, as well as Alfred Kinsey from Kinsey and Priest Vallon from Gangs of New York. The guy has been Michael Collins, Rob Roy, Ethan Frome, and Aslan the lion. Here, his role most closely resembles a performance a few years back in a Civil War era chase survival film that I quite like, Seraphim Falls, with Neeson pursuing and being pursued by Pierce Brosnan. In this film, there are some glowing sequences with Ottway's wife in flashbacks that violently rip him back into reality upon waking, as well as some cogent discussions of fate, free will, and what it means to survive. Carnahan is not afraid to let there be quiet moments, examinations of photographs, as well as showing Neeson's craggy face, bloody and scratched, as he considers his ever-diminishing options. In college, my American Literature Professor Lentz used to encourage us to write papers attempting degrees of difficulty, meaning there were paper topics that he considered significantly more challenging than others. You could get a higher grade for attempting a degree of difficulty on, say, Huck Finn or The Ambassadors. It was his acknowledgment that some papers involving wrestling with more challenging ideas, and that should be rewarded and encouraged. Some movies attempt more than others. Some play it safe. Some do not. Degree of difficulty is something that came to mind with this movie. Nearly every scene involves Neeson, the swirling snow, howling wind, as well as blood and actors wrapped up in ski masks and gloves. Carnahan's film feels oppressively cold, and although I didn't learn the names of the supporting characters, I liked some of the conflicts and philosophical debates as well as some of the gallows humor. In filming The Grey, Carnahan has taken on a degree of difficulty and delivered superlatively. It must have been an awful film to shoot. A word about the wolves. There's some impressively used CGI, as well as quick movements from either side of the frame, long and terrifying shots of sprinting wolves, and pairs of demonic yellow eyes approaching from the darkness. I'm not sure how many of the wolves used in the film were real wolves, but they felt real. In close-ups, the downright nastiness of them was overpowering, but they didn't take me out of the film as much as visual effects sometimes do. Carnahan seems to be using the wolf pack tracking the men to represent a malevolent force, as the ticking of time itself, as emblematic of nature's elements and all that constantly works to destroy a person. I have never been as scared of wolves as I was watching this film. The film's climactic final scene was riveting, and Neeson delivers the truth. I feel like it is impossible to witness Neeson in pain and emotional while remaining unmoved. I don't know if it is because of the personal tragedy that I know he has endured, or just because his face is so expressive and carries with it the remnants of his other characters with it. He brings baggage to a role in the best possible way. Wolves, watch out! Ferocious and bold, The Grey is a very good film with viciousness and harshness. Alpa Howling. Wolves Continue Howling. (Wolves always continue howling.)And do watch the film past the credits. Major degree of difficulty and one of the best films of 2012 so far.",The Grey
332,jaffacake2k,Silly!,2,19 May 2012,"How this film gets such a high score on this site amazes me - its currently bang-on 7. From the beginning i found Neeson's character to be unlikeable. So i certainly wasn't rooting for him! However it appears that he was supposed to be the 'hero' ... Way off the mark in my opinion.The plane crash and immediate aftermath was BEYOND a joke. Are we really supposed to believe that an accident of that sort in appalling weather conditions leaves only people that are dead - or totally unharmed? (minor aches and abrasions notwithstanding!) And then survive in the quasi-arctic wilderness for days without the obvious essentials? Shock and hypothermia would have killed them long before the wolves did!! The behaviour of the wolves was also unrealistic. And in several scenes it bordered on the supernatural! I wasn't sure if the Alpha wolf was actually supernatural in origin at first - it seemed super-intelligent. Since when do wolves on the hunt decide not to kill certain prey items because the Alpha wants to settle a score? Silly.Storyline, dialogue, characterisation were all terrible. I realise that during many films you have to suspend your disbelief and I'm happy to do so if that helps the film move along - but this entire scenario was just plain SILLY and took itself FAR too seriously.After reading so many positive reviews i was expecting something MUCH better. Perhaps there should be a reviewers age included in the review because its obvious that many reviewers here haven't seen a decent adventure movie before ... Im 45 for the record.",The Grey
333,daniel-829,"Awful. What a shame, Mr. Neeson",3,5 September 2012,"Painted and done up to be a thoughtful movie with some kind of a message, it's just a bad, bad mix of ""Call of the wild"" and ""Alive"".A bunch of people survive a plane crash in Alaska and get eaten by wolves.First of all, you didn't get to know the characters. Sure, they tried, letting you know of childhood memories and loving wives and oh so much that they did wrong in the past ... but you just didn't care. It was just lame and your brain ignored all this which resulted in you not feeling sorry for any of these folks when they died.And then there are the wolves. Or should I say Wolv-o-sauruses or whatever mutant/prehistoric idea they had when they told the animators to create these beasts. I don't know if you know this, but dogs are descendants of wolves. THink Husky, Malamut, German Shepherd ... that's what wolves are like, only wilder. They're not giants, they're not super-intelligent and feast on yummy human flesh. These beasts were a joke. I think there was one scene where a wolf was lowering its head to bite into a standing man's shoulder ... they were, on occasion, big as a horse. Once killed and skewered and roasted over a fire they shrink to coyote size.And then there are the scare-you-sh*tless scenes just to make you jump in your seat. Cheap trick which makes this film look even cheaper.I have no idea why Liam Neeson took on this role. Or rather, I wonder why he's been in rather bad-to-mediocre films these last few times. This one does him no good, you feel a bit sorry for him for stooping down to such a low level.I'm usually very easy to please so when I say it's bad, it's really bad!Mr. Neeson has a fantastic voice, though!",The Grey

335,feudalserfer,Overlong tripe,4,31 May 2012,"Far too long, comedy horror wolves, silly one-dimensional characters. Tremendously overrated. Liam Neeson is a fine actor, but he can't carry an entire film. The problem The Grey is that while it starts well, it somewhat tails off in the middle of the film, and what is a weak narrative begins to drag. The mens' desperation is well portrayed by a good cast, but the usual Jaws syndrome of making the animals almost superhumanly aware of their quarry becomes just a bit silly as the film draws to its conclusion.I'm not a fan of animatronics, especially when a supposedly real situation is being portrayed, and I felt that this became a real impediment as the men pitted themselves against wolves that would have looked more at home in a Hammer Horror or Harry Potter and the Order of the Muggle Dogs, or whatever ....The Grey might well have still worked if it had been edited somewhat, but it didn't, and it wasn't.",The Grey
336,bartverberne16,Underrated must-see gem,9,24 May 2013,"A group of oil rig workers, stationed on a compound somewhere in Alaska, are set for recess on the mainland US. During the flight back, something goes horribly wrong and the plane crashes in the middle of nowhere, i.e. in remote Alaska. Most of the workers die in the crash, but about 7 of them are 'lucky' enough to survive. Lucky with a huge blot, because as of now they are the prey of a pack of wolves with a strong will to kill those who don't belong in their land. Not just eat, no, kill. With a natural intuition for survival Ottway (Neeson) takes charge, and he suggests trying walking back to civilization in lack of any other option but dying. The group's attempt to escape to civilization is quite a journey, to say the least.'The Grey' is a fantastically unrelenting film that will leave you with a mixed emotion of melancholy and veneration of the wild. Carnahan depicted the wild very well, e.g. by using wide-angle shots showing the vast snowy landscapes, or by emphasizing the climate that the men have to deal with. This produces a sense of loneliness, and compassion for the poor men struggling for survival in the Alaskan snow. At the same time the wolves are continuously sensed lurking in the background, which gives the film a proper dose of tension. The movie slows down a bit by using philosophical debates between the men at quieter moment, discussing the meaning of life and religion in particular. However, this never halts the film sufficiently to be irritating.A strongly underrated film that is a must-see for those who like films that depict epic journeys a la Apocalypse Now or even Into the Wild.9/10",The Grey
337,reysia,Thrilling survival story although some appeared to unrealistic,8,4 April 2012,"The first time I saw The Grey poster, I said this must be a good movie. I said that because there's Liam Neeson. I've watched many of him and I like them. A man at his age probably difficult to do action scene but Neeson did the best he can.The Grey is a thrilling survival story. At first, I didn't know what the story about but slowly it became clearer. Being survived from a plane crash is a miracle but those people don't even know that bunch of wolves felt disturbed. Nothing but bare hand and wood stick are the only weapon they have to protect themselves. Even a skilled huntsman can't survive wolves with no weapon, that I can say for sure.Several part of the movie maybe looks like unrealistic and that made this movie looks bad. I didn't talk about how they travel without proper food and drink. That part is common in survival movie. I talk about the wolves. I think how the wolves hunt seemed unrealistic. But, I think the action part is still good. If they pay more attention to several details maybe they can make this movie better.The best thing about the story is that the story flows and increased steadily until it reaches its climax at the end.

He kicked ass in Taken, he fought hard in Unknown, and he was tough in The Grey. Not only did this movie have tough characters, it was fairly tough to watch. Between a violent plane crash, ground bearing injuries sustained, frostbite/exposure, and animal attacks, this was a pretty graphic film. It was not a ""feel good"" movie. I'm glad to see Hollywood let these characters win some battles, but not the war. Too often these days, anything the studios release are all WIN WIN movies. This one wasn't. In this scenario, there is no winning. You win by staying alive as long as you can and fighting until the end. The only thing I didn't like was the repetitive flashback sequences with Neeson's wife character. ""Be brave"" or ""be strong"" she says. Give me a break already, literally...I get the point! I've been in 2 life or death situations. When you're in them, the only thing you're thinking about at the time is how to get out of them.

Either you watch this as a sort of scientific curiosa - if only to see how little substance can be stretched into 2 outlandishly laughable hours...or you do yourself a favour, save your money and buy something MUCH more worthwhile (this list would be very long indeed in my opinion - very VEEERYY long indeed.(I just tried to post the above but was told that my review was too short - I am supposed to write a bunch of stuff apparently but how many ways can you describe AWFUL!) Very well then! A few details though many other reviewers have hit the nail upon the head. First, to take the most obvious flaw of all. Wolves may be meat-eaters but they are not killers. More people in North America are killed by deer than by wolves. In fact, I challenge anybody to come up with a credible news story that writes about wolves hunting humans. The cold. Oh boy. These guys with their matchstick fire - wouldn't last more than a few hours in the wind with the clothing they are wearing. Trust me I know. Then there is of course the Superman stunt across the gorge and bits of cloth tied together.... now THAT alone would be a miracle more amazing than the loaves and the fishes!

340,n-tune1234,neeson is brill again,10,8 July 2012,the grey is a about a man who is involved in plane crash and has to survive the cold wilderness whilst being hunted by wolves.the starting to this movie is a bit slow but after the plane crash the film soon picks up. i loved the idea that Liam neeson would play the role as he is one of my favourite actors.the film was all about survival and they portrayed that really well. the film in some ways was quite raw and scary as the wolves preyed amongst everyone i thought that the film was absolutely brilliant it will definitely be one of my most favourite films of all time. i would recommend it if you fancy a thriller without loads of violence but still with a bit in.,The Grey
341,jcmann01,Vulgarity is horrible and Movie is Depressing as Hell!,1,3 November 2012,"I normally like survival movies about people crashing somewhere in the wilderness and making it out alive (ie The Edge), but this one was horrible!! I don't know where the writers of this movie got their information about wolves and Alaska, but based on this movie it was mostly inaccurate. The writers know nothing about wolves in the wild? Wolves are not the trumped up predatory monsters as portrayed as in this movie and alpha males don't send their mates off to get barbequed and beheaded. The whole portrayal of wolf behavior is absolutely distorted. The writers should have watched National Geographic's Wolves of Yellowstone before creeping everyone out with this nonsense and undoing years of work by wild life conservationists like Shaun Ellis and Jim Dutcher.I don't know where they got their information about Alaska, but it is inconceivable that someone would jump into a river in freezing temperatures and get out and walk around in the snow without dying of hypothermia as portrayed at the end of the movie.The vulgarity was horrible, every seen was either violent or depressing, and their was this backdrop melancholic music that made everything worse. Oh, and then some genius decided to dupe in these distorted wolf cries & calls throughout the movie to creep viewers out. I don't understand why such a talented star like Liam Neeson wasted his talents doing a movie like this? He should find better roles to play?",The Grey
342,Melvin_Tigerfists,"Has Its Moments, But Severely Flawed",6,8 March 2013,"The Grey attempts to be three films in one... a straight-up horror movie, an action/adventure movie, and a transcendent examination of faith and the human spirit. The three do not mesh particularly well, and the transitions are occasionally obvious and jarring. It's really a pretty lousy horror movie despite the strength of the setup, and a profoundly unsatisfying action/adventure movie despite the potential of the premise, but it is a genuinely moving film about the value of faith and of endurance. I really wish that the director had thrown marketability and formula out the window and dedicated all his resources to the human interest aspects. When the film is firing on all cylinders in that regard, it's a truly fantastic parable. As it is, I'm sure most people just threw their hands up at the abrupt ending and told their friends that ""nothing happened"". The film probably would not have benefited much from stronger casting, even though most of the talent can't keep pace with Neeson.",The Grey
343,jshipbane,A good action movie to watch while camping (RV),8,10 December 2018,"When I first watched this in theaters, it sent chills down my spine (still does), but now every time I watch it, I develop a deeper aspect of this movie. I've read some of the negative reviews, saying ""that's not how it would've happened"" ""wolves don't act like that/wolves aren't that big"" etc. The Grey is not about surviving a plane crash or how to survive in the wilderness or how to fight wolves, it's about how you fight your inner demons (the wolves). It's about how you see yourself in any of life's stressful situations and how you either help yourself or ask for help. The Grey is a really well planned and well written movie.",The Grey
344,kennyevans,Great Premise - Boringly Unreal Depiction,3,20 May 2015,"I had to rewatch this film, after falling asleep during the first attempt and I never fall asleep during films. On the original watch at about the hour mark as they leave the plain I went drifting into the land of nod.So, to give it justice and fair crack of the whip I watched it again. 2 things jumped out at me: First the men did not reflect the dire situation they were in. The correct reaction to being plane crashed into a barren ice wasteland and slowly getting eaten by Wolves was nowhere near correct. I have to put this down to poor direction. Liam Neeson pretty much held that together by himself and he clearly 'got' the scenario but the other members of the group were far too blasé and non vocal about their plight and imminent death. When the 3rd to last guy just sat down to die, it was clear this director knew nothing of the human spirit to survive. Had he not researched how skeletal men, ridden with infection and malnourished continued to build the Bridge over the River Kwai, knowing that one day they may meet their families again? No one just lies down, particularly when he was just limping in the previous scene, he had not even reached crawling on his knees. This is in no way reflective of the human survival instinct and for me took away the last remnants of realism of this lacklustre film. (bearing in mind we are talking a sensible budget with a top box office draw actor in Neeson.)Next was the Wolves. We never really get to see them and it's almost like the director went with a 'Jaws' approach, less is more, don't show the monster in case it looks fake. But these are Wolves, just large dogs that everyone is familiar with and the lack of showing the personality of the Wolves kills the antagonistic angle in this film. We don't really know them, we hardly even see them and the time we do see them, they are clearly CGI or animatronic. I don't know why they didn't use real Wolves for some of the key scenes and do their best to make this as believable as possible, the film hinged on it for me. We have a pretty authentic plane crash scene but the stars of the show fall short of that IMO.The film wasn't overly long but it seemed it and it also seemed very spaced out, the pace was very slow even though on paper it went hopping from one tense scene to the next and should have bounced along nicely. Again I feel this was the directors fault maybe even at the cutting stage, it just lacks an impetus, an urgency that these guys need to keep moving, keep warm, keep eating etc. When making the obvious comparison to Alive! which doesn't have any Wolves, that film is far more engaging and compelling because it addresses the issues we would face in that scenario and I feel large elements of that basic survival context were absent from this film as mentioned.All in all a very flat film but I felt it was photographed nicely and given some of the conditions for filming, they crew did well in the circumstances. There's not much else to say given it was just a lot of ice and snow and a bunch of men walking about, just such a shame the characters were so shallow when the opportunity was there to flesh them out, make us feel the sympathy the film needed and cut down on some of the other unnecessarily drawn out sections to balance the film better. I don't understand for example why the suicide attempt was brought up at the end of the film, and even Leeson said it how it was ""it doesn't matter now"". Damn right, why not engage us in the other guy who's death we simply don't care about when he gets trapped under the log?Clearly a Neeson vehicle in the hands of an inexperienced director of the human condition in extremes.",The Grey
345,lowejnl,Not Cool,3,11 July 2021,"Not my type of movie when every single character dies a horrible death. I feel like it was a total waste of time watching it. Acting was great, the scenery was beautiful at times. But, just not a fan of everyone in the movie dying horrific deaths. I was mad whenever the last guy named Pete falls into the River, gets his shoes stuck in the tree trunk under the water, Liam tries to pull him up by his shoulders for an agonizing minute, instead of going underneath the water to see what's keeping Pete from coming up. Pete is panicking(I would too). He could have removed his shoes or Liams character could have. No matter what though, they all end up dying. Dumb.I also didn't like the way Liams character cursed God and called Him names, then when he asked God to show him something real and to give him something to help him, he would believe in Him the rest of his life. But they made it look like God did nothing to help him. Liam then calls God another name, then says he will rely on himself.Liam walks over to lay out the wallets, kneels down, sees wolves, then he is ready to fight to the death. Made it look like God was portrayed as I don't care, you're on your own. Anyways, Liams character died. Everyone died. The end. Lol.",The Grey
346,tandrei2001,full of clichés,5,3 March 2014,"I saw this movie with high expectations, as I like Neeson. But the movie disappointed me in most aspects. First of all, the plot is simplistic and predictable, with non important surprises. The script is mediocre and lines are stereotype, to give more substance to the main character. Neeson as usual, is doing a good job, but if I were him I wouldn't have accepted such a role. No matter how the actor tries to convince, he is limited by the script and direction. There are weak points in this movies, that makes it hardly believable. Not only that the extreme survival situations presented are simply not possible for humans, but the construction around this survival is poorly done. We never get to know why the plane crashed, where it was going to, or why did the main character wanted to suicide. It is indeed very common in American blockbusters that the main character is a macho man, that has suffered some trauma in his past, is depressed but not enough to kill himself (ironically... he is the last man standing in the end) and rarely speaks. He is cold blooded, experienced and with an unclear past. But there is still good inside him huh? Seen that before? The heavenly music and mixture of ""gore"" with memories of a past happy times just before the next action scene. Ridley Scott looks like he does it all the same, I could almost see the Gladiator coming to kill the alpha male of the wolfpack. Going to other unreal scenes, surviving at -10 after you have falling into a river and wet all your cloths is a bad joke for me. Overall, if you like adrenaline and want to be ""scared"" then go this movie, but if you passed that age and expect some more substance you can skip it.",The Grey

His presence spells mainstream, and mainstream needs a credible plot, which this film doesn't have.I acknowledge the pluses: imagery and acting, but (after many other turns I couldn't buy, though could forgive) when the hero falls into a river, then comes out and just keeps walking, soaking wet, in arctic temperatures, the film lost me.",The Grey
348,philosophyking87,A Very Well-Done Movie,10,10 June 2012,"This movie had an incredible feel to it - as you follow a man obviously going through troubled times in a foreign, barren sort of environment. Rather than simply ""show"" things, the director instead chose to leave many clues implied through indirect imagery, and the resulting effect is interesting. Moreover, the screenplay was great, the plot was great, the characters were all very interesting, the plane crash was very well- done and intense, and the audio effects and music were great any time a wolf appeared on screen - with the howls and yelps sending shills up your spine. Following these few survivors of a very unfortunate and odd plane crash was truly a pleasurable and unique experience. I really cannot remember the last time I saw a movie with this much power, impact, emotion, and a pleasant blend of both raw naturalism and artistic grandiosity. And lastly, the ending was truly impressive. I absolutely love poetry when it's recited in a movie at the right time (which reminds me of Sean Bean's role in Equilibrium, when he speaks the powerful words of the Irish poet, William Butler Yeats). Not to mention the fact that we hear a bit of Jamin Winans' ""The City Surf,"" which also appears in the movie ""Ink."" It's such a beautiful, moving piano piece.

How did the guy jump 50 feet across a drop off cliff and land in a tree? Impossible. They jumped across the cliff to escape the wolves, and when 1 guy fell, they were waiting on the ground to pull off the guy that fell.

The story seemed good, and the acting seemed great. The star is Liam Neeson. But Hollywood producers found a way to make this movie bad in EVERY way. After you're done watching it, you'll wish you had another two hours because you just wasted two. So when this similar to Lord of the Flies tale starts, a plane crashes in the middle of a snowy forest. They have to find food and get along with each other. Liam Neeson plays the lead, and is the only one who has actual sense. Next thing you know there are wolves but you can't see anything because it's night and the whole scene is just a mess. You here growling but you don't see anything! The acting was bad, the story was irrational, and the whole movie was unrealistic. The one thing that really bothered us was at the very end. (SPOILER ALERT) As we may have guessed, Liam Neeson was the only survivor. He then comes in contact with the big head wolf.

352,enilenis,Would you watch it if it weren't for Liam Neeson?,2,24 April 2012,"The problem with this movie is that it is completely generic and predictable. A story that did not have to be told. If it wasn't for Liam Neeson, few would watch it. He is the only asset of this film, which is the reason his face is as big as the movie poster. It's an actor notoriety flick with no substance.Take the number of characters, divide it by the number of minutes in the film and you'll have your action schedule. The formula is as follows: ""Present a death. Travel to a different setting. Present the next death. Rinse, lather, repeat."" Take the main character and the main villain and reserve them for the end of the movie. Give a meaningless task to a secondary character (collecting wallets), putting him second to last in the sequence of potential casualties. Proceed with murdering characters from the least to the most developed. Partially incapacitate each group member who is about to depart offering hints to events that are already beyond obvious.There was absolutely nothing interesting about the film, and I feel saddened by the fact such a great actor would reduce himself to acting in made-for-TV class movies.Would you watch the movie someone else played the main role? Would you even notice it? Would you pay money to watch Linden Ashby (or someone equally recognizable) portray Ottway?Nevertheless, if you're into these kinds of flicks, I'd highly recommend Frank Marshall's ""Alive"".

356,afh179,How an action-thriller should be done,8,22 March 2012,"I'll start off by stating the obvious : this is not an uplifting movie in any way. It's dark and disturbing, and at times hard to watch. On the outside, it's an action-thriller packed full of realistic creature violence and plenty of suspense. Look deeper, however, and you'll find a chilling meditation on what is worth doing to survive, and just how meaningful life really is.The story revolves around a man named Ottway (played with brilliance by Liam Neeson). He is a rifleman protecting oil rig workers from wolves when they are drilling in areas of wolf inhabitance. After a plane crash, Ottway and a small group of men end up stranded deep in the freezing cold and lonely heart of wolf country. Through the men's efforts to survive, they learn much about each other and their lives. The cinematography is beautiful, capturing the cold bare landscape perfectly. The camera-work is eerie and mesmerizing, and the acting is top-notch as well, especially from the always brilliant Neeson. The wolf scenes were wonderfully brutal, and while sometimes unrealistic, they do the job in striking real fear in the viewer. After all, imagine if it was you stuck in the cold surrounded by wolves, with very little in the way of defense. The last thing I will say is the movie's ending was perfect. I can understand why some may be disappointed, but at no point in this movie was I more on edge. The intensity and passion that is packed into the final scene will leave you shaking.We may only be pushing four months into the year, but this is still the best movie I have seen in 2012. It's a bleak film, but a thrilling and wildly entertaining one. It will leave you thinking about your own life, and putting yourself in the character's shoes. Don't go see this if you don't like movies that stick with you, because this one will be sure to make a home in your brain for a few days.

It is a lot scarier than I had anticipated, but it was the anticipation that scared me, when the wolves finally rear their ugly heads, they were just as fake as the sentiment. A couple of red LEDs in the dark along with gruff panting, does not a convincing wolf make.Liam Neeson has become some sort of hero in a lot of boys eyes, but alas, he is no superhero.

Some very poor over-usage of CGI wolves (which are apparently also on steroids or demonic) and a host of logistical failures help to quickly unravel this tale of roughneckers trying to survive a plane crash in the Alaskan wilderness. Some of it is just plain ol' dumb.The filmmakers desperately needed to hire on someone like Bear Grylls as a consultant in the matters of surviving the wild and the elements- the characters and some of the decisions they made given the setting would make a child question their validity. It's very rare that I think about leaving the theater halfway through a film, but the brain-dead script really put my patience to the test. It appears that Director and Co-Writer Joe Carnahan is hell-bent on never being able to live up to the greatness of his 2002 film ""Narc"". At least his 2010 motion picture version of ""The A-Team"" was guilty pleasure fun...There's an added 4 seconds of footage after the credits that, surprise, is also worthless.I had been looking forward to this movie for quite some time- needless to say, I was sorely disappointed.

It is great thriller,and even through not a ""great"" movie, what it did, it did well. And then the end hit, and then the entire movie fell apart in my opinion. And I'm talking the very second the black screen comes and the credits roll here.Allow me to explain what it was like to watch The Grey. Especially since I enjoyed it so much while watching it. imagine a performer on stage. He begins by starting up a couple chainsaws and juggling them. It's amazing. Then he puts down the chainsaws, and puts up a tight rope, which he walks across on his hands. Again, amazing. Then he tells you something you just don't believe. He is now going to walk across the tight rope, on his hands, over a spike pit, while juggling chainsaws with his feet. Oh man, this you gotta see right. So the performer walks around stage, setting up the spike pit and starting the chainsaws, then, he simply walks off stage with everything set up, never to return. This, is EXACTLY how watching The Grey felt to me.It was not a bad movie, It tried a little too hard on some of the dialog scenes I think, but, especially for a thriller, it was fun, nerve wracking, many shots were very eerie, my ability to predict who was going next was at zero, and I was ready to give the movie at least 7 or 8 stars. Then the credits rolled, and I instantly debated giving it even 1. I had to give it a couple more because, as I explained, what it did, it did well. But literally, the ENTIRE movie builds to an event they NEVER show. It is not artistic or imaginative, it's not edgy or brilliant, it's just a bad writing cope out. When the entire script is making you focus on this one thing, you don't just simply leave it out of the movie.

And here's why: ~Liam Neeson - this guy is one of the most underrated action actors of our time. He is always amazing, even if given somewhat lame material to work with. He just shows the passion in his eyes. Case in point - the final scene in this movie. ~The other acting- Dermot Mulroney and the other less familiar names - ALL did a fabulous job. You agonized right along with them. ~The plane crash was pretty cool. Nothing will ever match that scene in ""Alive!"" when that whole back half of the plane got sucked out but considering the advancement of film making since ""Alive!"" - the plane crash was a great scene! ~Also, the flashbacks were well done and not in a confusing way like in some films. I especially was moved by the scenes with Ottway's wife.All in all I was entertained. Was it realistic? Not so much, but who doesn't want to get thrown into a bit of dramatic, exciting fantasy stuff from time to time. My only gripe is the ending and here's my ""spoiler"". WTF? Really? We don't know what happens? Seems it was Ottway vs. the alpha and he was armed with a fistful of broken bottles and a knife vs the wolf. Will we have a sequel?",The Grey

365,Worldstone,Watched by so many for all the wrong reasons due to misleading trailers.,10,20 November 2017,"This movie is not about Action, it's not about watching half a dozen men battle it out with a pack of wolves. It's not about seeing Liam Neeson wrestle to the death with an alpha wolf in the freezing snow.Many fail to realize that this movie is an allegory for the struggles we face as we live our lives, and how every time something comes to challenge you between death and life you have to fight back and be strong.By the end, you see his wife's dying on a hospital bed, her last words to him were ""don't be afraid"", telling him to be strong. This is where you realize why he's been contemplating suicide and how the world around him has become so cold. His life then flashes before his eyes with the unforgettable poem. That scene tears a hole in my heart every time I see it. I always cry until my eyes dry out at the last few minutes of this misunderstood movie.You can talk about how unrealistic it is. About how poorly they showed how wolves act and the logic behind nature. But as far as I can tell, they already died when the plane crashed, them walking through the frozen wastelands of Alaska and getting picked off by the pack led by the black alpha wolf was them moving on one by one from purgatory as they slightly understood one another and what they've dealt with in their lives.In the end, death is black and life is white, we all end up in the grey at some point.",The Grey

I find that they missed their target in both categories. The depth in the form of the main character's memories of his dead father and wife never created the connection needed to feel for him nor did the open ending serves the purpose of an interesting twist.The man versus animal aspect of the movie also seemed at times over the top and cliché, one can't help making the connection with movies like Aliens and Predator but not in good way. On the plus side the movie has superb scenery thanks to the snow covered Wilderness images and it also contains enough action to make it an okay movie but nothing more as far as I'm concerned.",The Grey
369,Bascoda,Urk!,2,16 June 2012,"Let me begin by saying that I have a great deal of respect for Liam Neeson as an actor and have enjoyed many of his roles, so I guess he's allowed a turkey every once in a while. I can willfully suspend my disbelief with the best of them, but this movie just asks too much. I tried to look at it as an allegory, or a metaphor or whatever else you care to call it. I really wanted to like it, but I have had too much survival training, have spent too much time in Alaska, and know too much about both wolves, and cold and its effects on the human body, to be able to make the leap into pure fantasy that this movie demands. Just couldn't do it. People who work in Alaska learn early on that one of the cardinal rules of survival if your plane crashes in the bush - and a lot of them do - is to STAY WITH THE PLANE! So, of course, the first thing that Liam and his merry band of survivors do is leave the crash site. It goes downhill from there. I won't go into detail, there's just too much, except to note that the dip in the river that the last two survivors take (one of them drowns but the other, Neeson, lives) makes the final scene an impossibility - he would have been incapacitated by hypothermia long before he got to the wolves' den. The acting was excellent, as was the cinematography, otherwise, I would have rated this a zero.",The Grey
370,edwardgamper-0-128609,Not the movie you were expecting,6,5 June 2012,"Watching the trailer for The Grey, you'd certainly be forgiven for thinking this was going to be a Stallone-style Cliffhanger-type movie. Men leaping off cliff edges, flaming spears, Liam Neeson wrapping broken glass round his hands and fighting wolves. Yep, sounds like a standard action movie. It isn't.My biggest problem with The Grey is the marketing. And I can understand the conundrum marketers faced with this. Because contrary to the trailer and poster, this is actually a rather existential, angsty story about facing death. The problem is that it's not psychological enough. Just when it goes all Touching The Void, a big CGI wolf that looks marginally better than the one in The Never Ending Story, rears its furry head and pulls us out of reality.But when the wolves do show up, there isn't enough action either. So for me The Grey fails to be either a compelling psychodrama or a no-brainer action movie - the latter was what I was expecting. I would however, recommend the film and certainly enjoyed aspects of it. But I they should have made it far clearer this was not the action film presented in the trailer. Though the film did provide some element of humour for me as I imagined a gang of teenage boys in the cinema laughing and cheering before the slow realisation that this is not Taken with wolves.",The Grey
371,mambx,Intense..,9,4 March 2012,"Just got back from watching this, and must I say it's rather good. I'm a fan of Neeson's movies but sometimes find them very clichéd to the fact that he's always the 'boss', like an older Stone, but this movie stood out than the other ones such as Taken etc.Firstly, acting was top notch, all did a great job. I was literally intense throughout the whole movie, even put my hands in front of my eyes and peeked through in some scenes, the build up was done extremely well! It's a very sinister and dark movie, like everyone else I was expecting a vaguely happy ending with at least Neeson getting away, but what this movie is, is depicting mankind and how we survive in such circumstances, how we deal with certain issues outside our comfort zone and how we respond to death. Have to mention how great the soundtrack was as well! The wolves were ferocious and took no prisoners, along with the snow. Shows how brutal nature can be. Something different was collecting everyones wallets, and I thought that was a good act. I only have one small issue with this movie... it's too slow in some parts, and needed a bit more action (even though I do understand it was trying to depict a real life and death situation, bit hard fighting a pack of mad wolves, but it's still a movie!)However I still found this film really good, and had me one edge throughout.recommended!",The Grey
372,AtlasWolf,The Primal Instincts of Man .,8,20 January 2019,"This movie moved me. I've never understood the negative reviews. I think it's because the trailers portrayed it as an action movie of man vs wolf. No thank you...This is a story of survival. Surviving is a basic human instinct, even if you believe your life has no value. The character growth and conversations really made this movie. There are some action parts to grab the cheap thrills of a common movie goer. But if you're looking for something of far more value, you can definitely find it in this movie. Man vs nature, God and a character study on men at their most vulnerable.I sat in the theatre in the dark soaking everything in after the credits stopped until I was asked to leave by the theatre staff.",The Grey
373,thegreyrating,Best. Movie. Ever.,10,5 December 2014,"The Grey is exceptional and all other films should be held accountable to this pinnacle of film excellence. It is unlikely any other film will ever compare to The Grey, and even less likely that a film will ever receive a rating of 10 Wolves out of 10 like The Grey has. This film brilliantly weaves together complex themes such as individual survival in the physical, emotional and spiritual sense; group survival; man versus the elements; and the inexplicable drive to live at all cost. In addition, the writing is sublime. The dialogue is never forced and subtlety reigns supreme. From the terse dialogue to the abrupt poetic interludes everything is balanced masterfully. This compliments the flawless acting, highlighted by Sir Liam Neeson. It is not surprising that the film industry has increased the amount of repackaged material, sequels, prequels, and remakes since The Grey came out. There is no point in creating anything unique because nothing will ever compare to this masterpiece. In a way this makes me sad, but not really because I can just watch The Grey instead.

That's exactly how I felt after being forced to sit through this sorry mess of a film.Right from the word go the portrayal of wolves was so wrong I was wondering if they were going to turn out to be werewolves or something. And as the film went on I found myself laughing more and more at the absurdity of the wolves' behavior - 'sending in the omega to test out how strong we are' indeed, ha ha ha.And it then went on from the ridiculous to the even more ridiculous - having survived an impossible jump over a chasm, the men are then met with the very same bunch of wolves they are escaping from on the other side of the chasm. How did the wolves get there? Did they have a cable car? Did they use a zip line? Or did they sprout wings and fly?Agh, words fail me, and I haven't even mentioned the dumb humans! The most annoying thing is I might have actually enjoyed the message (if there was one) in this pile of poo if it hadn't kept on relentlessly slapping me in the face with it's ridiculousness.This has got to be serious competition to Battleship as Neeson's worst film...",The Grey

Too much bad language is a bore and this film must come at the top for the number of times the F word was used.

Do not take your grandmother. Do not take your faint-of-heart girlfriend. But if you want a kick ass action movie that does not take the usual course of 'action' flicks and, as some of the above reviews state, a movie that will stay with you a while this is it. This movie does not have car chases, nor 'bad guys', so don't go looking for those. This is a movie that gets into your head. Liam Neeson is one of my favorite actors in almost anything he's in, but this role seems tailored to him. Ottway is a broken man at the start of the movie, as he himself says in his first few lines. He works at the end of the world doing a dirty job to protect the scum that have washed up with him there. Yet there is steel in him that only tremendous adversity can bring out. In this movie the cold and frozen landscape is as much a character as any of the supporting cast, and on a par with the wolves to challenge any man. I once saw Neeson as Ethan Frome and I thought that was a bleak, cold landscape. This movie is several degrees bleaker and colder. The supporting cast are great as a batch of misfit men thrust into a situation they have never had any preparation for. This film could have been written by Hemingway and Jack London collaborating with Homer. Do round up bunch of your buddies and go see this movie - oh, and stay till after the credits roll.

I couldn't figure out why they didn't take more items from the plane wreckage to use as crude weapons, like there wasn't going to be any large sharp metals objects laying around after a plane crashed?I would have rated it higher had the supporting characters been a little more fleshed out. It was hard to care about them as thin as they were.I liked the ending a lot, my wife (who ironically dragged me to the film) didn't like it.

378,xundarz,"a bad replica of ""The Edge""",2,5 April 2012,"There are so many thing wrong with this film I don't even know where to start.Firstly, the story is bad. It lacks depth in such a way that you don't even feel sorry for the characters when they die. An attempt to make us connect with the main character was tried but it was a failure in my opinion. I never really understood why Jhon Ottway wanted to kill himself, neither have I understood the relationship between him and the girl he kept on seeing. The acting is as good as it can be in such a film... All the characters are cold and frightened all the time and that is not really a surprise.Secondly, it is truly unrealistic. What annoyed me the most was the lack of attention to details. The snow never melted on their face, a single stick burned with a flame, all the ""fighting"" scenes took place at night so you can't see anything etc. In addition, wolfs don't behave like that. After they kill a wolf: "" It's an Omega. They sent him to test you."" Really? And the thing that almost made me walk away was the fact that the wolf were always there when someone was in trouble. There were other things, such as: the inexistence of hypothermia after he got out of the river, the idiotic jump from the cliff to the tree etc.After all that, I expected a good ending at least... Did I get it? That depends on how you look at things. At first I was disappointed but then I found out there are a few extra seconds bonus after the credits. It made it a little bit better. I do not recommend The Grey mostly because I had great expectations from it. Watch The Edge instead. 2/10*",The Grey

Qui-Gon, the name I still use for the great actor that is Liam Neeson, still has got it. One thing that I found different in this movie that I think he might have cursed the most in all the movies I've seen him in. The movie kind of started out weird, but once things started rolling, I don't think I ever sat back down from the edge of my seat. It was that intense. If you mix the survival story from ""The Edge"" and the tense, I-can't-watch-this moments from ""The Hurt Locker"", you have this movie. I'm still unsure of what the message of the movie was, but if it was to instill a fear of wolves, it did its job. I don't think I'll ever look at wolves the same, even the ones that are so easy to kill in Skyrim. The plot was kind of similar to the first ""Predator"" movie where there's a group of people that dwindle down to a few. Even at the parts where you think nothing is going to happen, that's when it's the most intense. One tip for this movie: Stay after the credits. It will help clear up anything you will probably question at the end. I'd definitely recommend this movie.",The Grey
380,take_the_cannolis,Good but could have been much better,6,29 January 2012,"Cinematography was great, score was good, acting was good: led by Liam Neeson's strong performance, however the screenplay and movie itself still left something to be desired. There were just a few too many holes or illogical moves. There were also too many long slow scenes that seemed like the director was awkwardly trying to add more dimension to the characters.First of all I surmise the director or screenwriter has never seen any of the multitude of survivor shows on TV in the last 5+ years or just knows very little about basic survival tactics: Like leaving a plane crash before giving rescuers any chance of finding them even though the plane was sure to have a transponder. They could and should have easily built snow caves or forts to protect themselves from both the elements and the wolves.There were quite a few other holes or illogical moves as well. My guess is that over editing may have created many of these holes. The Edge, a similar plane crash adventure movie written by academy award winner David Mamet was in my opinion was a much better story and more expertly made movie.Still it was entertaining and overall worth the eight and half bucks for the matinée.",The Grey
381,Taylor_Gillen,"Both goods and bads, but a nice work of art",7,29 July 2012,"The idea behind the story of The Grey is by no means unique, and its title does nothing to produce deep thought. However, there are still a lot of good qualities about this film that lead me to give it an 8. First I will cover the pros and then I will cover the cons.Luckily, all the characters (except Diaz) are just intelligent enough to be realistic. Though Liam Neeson's character probably knows more than anyone would about wolves, it is important to have at least one strong leader in a story of survival. The pacing is excellent. The duration of this movie is just what it needs to be. I never wondered when the next scene would finally come, as I do in some movies. The makers of the film did a good job at making the suspense very intense. Along with that, they made sure the wolves only made brief appearances until the end. Though you see them momentarily, they vanish quickly. This adds to the mystery and sparks the imagination.I did feel like the beginning before the crash was underdeveloped. We see Neeson doing his job and narrating, but this is mainly it - 10 to 12 minutes are spent watching him gaze sullenly into space. In addition, I felt that the supporting actors were also underdeveloped. Most are difficult to differentiate between and have a clear sense of who the character is, or his name for that matter. (Diaz and Burke were the exceptions, since Burke was black and Diaz was mean.)I also rarely felt a sense of hope. As this is a drama/action/thriller, the characters should be able to gain the upper hand for at least some part of the movie. Watching this film, I saw each character get picked off one by one until Neeson finds himself in the worst of places: their den. Each time the characters trekked onward, someone died. This made deaths predictable by the end.",The Grey

Brutal, gritty yet teeming with subtle ideas as big and compelling as the Alaskan vistas that provide the film's backdrop, ""The Grey"" is a film of barren beauty, suggestive, at moments, of the grandeur and mystique of a Tarkovsky film, and clearly intended for audiences more sophisticated than those Hollywood usually targets. The casting is terrific, a small group of actors offering up a set of superbly delineated characters and Neeson is in great form.

384,Reverend3000,Disappointed,7,1 September 2014,"This movie had some shining moments. It had some suspenseful moments. It also had a couple of fine performances. But the outcomes of the events are too much on the teeter-totter tipping toward tragic versus good. But that isn't helped either by the unconvincing events that happen and the unrealistic dialogue by some of the characters. First of all, I expected less survivors from the initial crash, and second, it seems that the film writers are feeding you to much of tale, rather than realistic depiction, of people quite literally getting picked off ONE at a time by wolves. And of course, the most lovable characters seem to be able to survive better. This is with the exception of the one antagonist of the group, whose suicidal decision to make the remaining two leave him, is truly unconvincing with an embarrassing monologue on the beauty of the surrounding nature versus the dullness of his life. Yeah, I was unconvinced and found it near laughable. Also, I read some users on here give it praise for some supposed existential message. This undertone of the film did not play well into the movie, and it was unnecessary. While I did like the scene of Liam's character yelling at the sky, this could've been included without the other talk and minor references. If this is what existentialist subject matter is to some viewers, then I have to say I disagree. The little philosophy that was expounded in this film was very cheap, I would say by anybody's terms. And least of all, but still importantly, I recognize that this is a movie, and can taken cinematic liberties. Even Jaws was an excellent movie despite the inaccurate depiction of shark behavior, but this movie's unrealistic portrayal of how wolves act territorially and in relation to humans, is so over the top. These aren't killer bees! And I have to say, one reviewer on here rightly pointed out that none of these characters with knives,thought to use them as spears tied to sticks, which would be anyone's first explored option for defense. However despite this, I was overall entertained, and engaged, the entire time and thought it did have suspense in numerous areas. Also, the wolves do appear frightening. The way this was done truly gave it a chilling feel (despite maybe being laughable to seasoned outdoorsmen that have dealt with wolves).",The Grey

388,sabretooth91,Beautiful Tragedy,7,1 February 2012,"I don't know why I expected this to have a happy ending. Maybe its because the previews made me believe that the protagonist is fighting to get home to his wife. Since I thought there would be some level of romance, I took a lady friend with me to see this. Bad idea. As it turns out, she hates the sight of blood! Whoops! (Back to the movie) The Grey does an excellent job of revealing key plot details throughout the movie, at a good rate. It has great character development and I felt like I was there with real guys, and like I was working and running with them. The wolves were the right amount of terrifying, and mysterious. I particularly enjoyed the Alpha male parallel to the actual pack's alpha male, and our main character. The pack dynamics facts were spot on, and that was great to see. Some of the wolf special effects were a bit shaky. Some were incredible! However, others were really poor. I loved the use of the scenery and how the mood was set using the elements.All-in-all, this is a great movie. I probably won't watch it again, because I don't need to. It loses points for the few occasions where the special effects lacked and just because I was expecting a different ending, and I left the theater feeling a bit depressed. Don't get me wrong, the ending was fantastic, and beautiful in so many ways. It is probably the best/only way to end this movie, as a matter of fact. So many things came together at the end, it really makes sense. But at the time, I wanted to be happy. The action was great, the group/pack dynamics were superb. I hope the viewers are educated enough and payed close attention to notice the parallels throughout this movie. Both, the Alpha male, and the Omega. The camera work was incredible, as well.In conclusion, I recommend this movie to people who like good plots, action junkies, people interested in survival, and people with knowledge of wolves. It does NOT have a romantic side-plot (really). If you're a special effects snob, don't bother; because we both know you won't be able to get over those little things, and you'll never enjoy the movie (or any movie for that matter). When the theater went dark at the end of the movie, I sat there and digested what happened, and felt bad. Just bad in general. Messed up things happen in this story. Necessary, but messed up. The ""realism"" was really a priority. Then, I was left feeling like all was lost.

389,Olivian_Breda,One of the best movies I've ever seen,10,11 March 2012,"(spoilers ahead!)I've read quite a few of the reviews on IMDb and on other web sites.I think there are two keys of interpreting this movie: - An action movie. - A movie talking about something else than just the action.In my opinion, a lot of commentators and viewers of the movie focus on this part. a. On the good side, in the movie: - The visual effects are fine, the wolves look nice, the accident is depicted with nice effects. - Sound is good (helped me enter the world). - The main character, Ottway (Liam NEESON), sends you emotions. You see him most of the time, and Liam NEESON does a good job with the character. - There are some pauses for contemplative moments, it makes you think. - Is not at all a complicated movie. Even the spiritual part is quite easy to comprehend.b. On the poor side, the movie: - Tends to be unrealistic. The storyline (the accident, the way in which wolves are everywhere), the characters (wolves' behavior), the scenery (not too cold). This is totally different from a documentary. - Has a quite poor & simple script, on an action-side comparing. Accident - people die - wolves live. Not too much thinking. - Doesn't care for secondary roles. Yes, Ottway develops well. But there are other characters in the movie, also. At some time, you don't really care they die. - The story is sad. Even if the ending is uncertain (you have to see it after the credits), the movie is rather sad. - Also, it's a violent movie. Sometimes, more about fear-inducing moments, rather than by shocking you with visually displeasing images.OK, this is what you get by looking at the script, actors, wolves, scenery. From this, you get a feeling that the movie is about 5 out of 10, not a very poor movie, but also not a good one.Still, some commentators do say some things about the spiritual part, and I will focus on this.In my opinion, the movie is actually not a movie about survival, nature vs. man, how to fight wolves. Yes, these are themes in the movie, but the movie is not about this. In my opinion, the movie has this message: - You can live a life based on survival instincts. Wolves do this, in the movie. - You can live for other things than just for living as much as possible. There are other things worth living for. This is what makes the humans humans in the movie.Let's talk about the wolves: - Generally, in nature things tend to be simple: ""eat, live, procreate, sleep, and do this until you die"". This is the basic model. - The wolves tend to be a bit higher than this, they don't attack to feed themselves, they act to protect themselves. While this is a bit higher than the basic need, it's still a survival action (""I attack you, so that you don't attack me, so that I live""). So, wolves act as animals wishing to survive.Now, let's focus on the people: - They don't want to hear a scientific, demonstrated truth on how to survive a plane crash, they care about the feelings more than logic. - It's totally immoral to steal a dead man's money. Even if the man is dead. Even if the money would be otherwise lost. - On the opposite, it's totally fine to take with you something of a memory of a deceased person. Even if the person is dead, even if the process of finding the wallets takes time & energy, even if it's not that important to them, they do this for both the memory of the dead one and for their love for the relatives of the deceased. Instead of focusing on surviving, they focus on the emotions of the relatives of dead persons. This is totally opposite to living as an animal, for survival. - The passengers have in wallets symbols (photographs) of their loved ones. - They stop to pray for the deceased prior to leaving the set. - Even if this may get them into trouble, one person defies the wolves by decapitating one and throwing the head at them. - One guy prefers to die alone, in the middle of beautiful scenery. He ignores the surviving instinct and stops fighting. No animal would ever commit suicide. - There are a lot of scenes with courage. - Ottway's wife lives after her death. She's not dead, the memories live past her life. It's in his head. - Finally, the whole movie is a survival struggle - the wolves struggle to live, and even if they attack, they don't dare attacking the group of people. People run all the time. Except for the end part. Ottway faces his fears and attacks. He's alone against the wolves, and he attacks. He's better than the wolves (who don't dare to attack).To me, the movie is a metaphor - what is important for you? - Living as long as possible, and fulfilling animal desires - surviving, safety, procreation; versus - Living for things which are not material (courage in front of death, living with memories, love for the other, spiritual processes, human habits, symbols)?Is the movie depressing? Almost all the humans die (even Ottway's wife). Yet, to me, the movie shows that people can live for other things than just surviving. Ottway's wife lives after her death. People who survive the crash, by acting as humans, and not as animals, prove worthy of the name ""human being"".Great movie, like ""Le notti di Cabiria"", explaining life.My web site: getaresultnow.com",The Grey
390,adamcrossstills,something with a little intelligence rather than a blood bath,6,8 June 2012,"I just finished watching The Grey and I have to say I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would. I thought it was going to be a tacky film that was going to blindly follow similar types of movies through the snow to a similar end and I would be disappointed but this was not the case. Of course the film is far from perfect or realistic, I'm not exactly an expert on wolves but I'm not sure that this film is based on any kind of typical wolf behaviour. The wolves themselves sadly looked more like their beefy Twilight cousins rather than real wolves which is a shame but I am glad that the film was more about the men and their relationship to each other and how they were going to get through their situation than simply a movie about Liam Neeson killing wolves (which is what the trailer would have you believe) so well done Joe Carnahan and Ian Mackenzie Jeffers for writing and adapting something with a little intelligence rather than a blood bath. 3/5",The Grey
391,TypedbyTara,Liam Neeson and the Big Bad Wolves,4,2 February 2012,"When I first saw the trailer for this movie I was totally pumped! I'm a huge fan of Liam Neeson and I try to see of all of his works. I had hoped that this movie would have the same tune as Neeson's other work Taken, where he basically kicks ass with his super-human ninja skills, but alas, it did not.If you like pure, raw unavenged killing then this movie is for you! I can sum this movie up in one sentence: A pack of wolves hunted down and killed a group of plane-crash survivors, slowly and very painfully-leaving no survivors. Boom that's it the end. There was a couple of meaningless conversations, and only one meager attempt to fight the wolves, but it was basically a free-for-all human killing. Oh and for the record, the actual ""wolves"" were horrible! I mean In my opinion that was some very lack-luster animation. The werewolves from Twilight looked more believable, the producers didn't even bother to use actual wolves to fill in for some of the less important scenes.Finally, there was the utter lack of a triumphant battle scene. I doubt anyone who was watching the movie actually expected Neeson's character to make it out alive, but hell I'd rather see him go down fighting!! Folks, even though the trailer makes it look like Liam ""kicks wolf butt"" the truth is you never even see him lay a finger on a wolf.",The Grey

Tont Scott gave us an insultingly misleading depiction of wolf behaviour, in which the creatures behave and consequently attack in a very similar manner to the baddie his elder brother's film ' Alien'. That had to be the most inept (and did I mention boring?) survival film I have seen to date.

So therefore, I was recommended the wrong film.It was a good allegory of nature versus wild and definitely based on true events. The whole discourse of 'narrative vs spectacle' can be brought to light here. The dialog was completely inaudible so I managed to follow the story without it, leaving my surround sound system to function.

When I came out of the theater i felt robbed, because nor did it have wolves fights it barley had any fights. I knew what they were trying to do, make it about human contact more than nature.They did a great job devlepoing the characters, i mean what else are they gonna do around the fire? Tell ghost stories? So you have 7 men who all share there stories and are fighting to survie to get home. Though is all the stereotype characters, The tough guy, the salvager and the brainy etc etc.My biggest conern with this movie was that in the trailer, it showed wolves, wolves, wolves and wolves. Yes wolves are in the movie though never actually see them really, yes we know that there out there and they are going to attack. But when they do attack its very obscure and not very villgant. When they finally do kill a wolf, its only one just one 7 men against wolves, and all they got was one.The ending was very strong though, i liked that Nelson finally gave in and begged god for help, just to show you that all men have a breaking point and that when they know its the end they turn there beliefs on or off.",The Grey

Pretty basic theme with some non-specific character development. Nice parallels drawn btwn the wolves and the men...who are the TRUE animals? Many scenes could have been better and many were uncomfortably long...as in is this dopey dialogue ever going to end? Acting was decent and the characters somewhat believable. The wolves not so much...the CGI was murky and close-ups wooden with a laughable walking paw shot. After one attack we see a trail of perfect wolf prints in the snow...the wolf must have picked up the victim with his front paws and tiptoed away on toe legs. Lots of goofs like that. Liam was decent...altho I cant help but wonder if he channeled the death of his real-life wife for the part. I'd rec it if you want a guy-flick with some scares and a mild message. Maybe they'll make a sequel and feed Liam's idiot daughter from 'Taken' to the wolves.",The Grey

The acting is very good and I am a big fan of Liam Neeson, Dallas Roberts and also Dermot Mulroney who was almost unrecognizable in the movie. So I really wanted to like this move.

However, this was not the case at all. The coolest part of the movie is the plane crash. After that it was just a slow paced movie about the group of survivors getting picked off one by one by wolves or the harsh environment. I just thought the plot of the movie was more of a circle than a straight forward narrative. Liam Neeson's character is suicidal, ends up getting in a plane crash and is now trying to survive. There was also an unnecessary amount of the use of the F bomb, so much that as of right now I can barely remember much of the actual dialogue. The thing that really bothered me the most about this movie was that trailer showed the final scene in the movie where he straps broken bottle to his fists and is about to go head on with the alpha male and then black. The end. One of the most disappointing movie endings I've seen in a long time. The point is, do not waste your time going to see this movie.",The Grey

The actors aren't that bad in my opinion, the people they portray are believable and you get the odd side story to learn a little more about them, but in no great detail. As for Neeson, he can never do any wrong by me, he'll always be Qui Gon from Star Wars in my eyes lol. He plays a pretty heartless character, although we don't know a lot about his background, you can see the pain and torment and i think he does really well putting this across, he plays it well. The other guys (relative nobody's) in it don't do too bad either, they just seem to swear a lot.This certainly isn't a film for kids, lots of swearing and the violence is pretty.. brutal. It's a bit cold hearted in my opinion. It's doom and gloom from the word go.Anyway i can't say much more without spoiling it.

I thought it would look ancient and be boring but I have found myself longing to watch episode after episode. They are filled with faith, love and good endings. They teach that life is full of meaning and that there is a God who cares about us and provides for us even in difficult times and through great trials. Watching them makes we want to be a better father and a better husband.Watching ""The Grey"" made me feel empty, even depressed.

I'm not even going to bother with the whole spoiler alert, because if you pass on this movie, your life will be better for it.I have to start at the most ridiculous moment I've seen in movies in recent memory, the cliff jump. Really? Really? I'm almost positive that Carl Lewis would have only made it about 2/3's across that ravine before falling to his death. In this movie, you've got some random white guy whose already a few inches away from death after evading a pack of predatory wolves for over 24 hours jumping across a 30 foot plus wide cliff with a few hundred foot drop. I almost turned it off at that point, but the movie was 2/3s over at that point. Of course he made it, and made some ridiculous Macguyver rope of clothing tied together for the others to get across. But hey, at least they were rid themselves permanently of the pack of wolves chasing them. Nope, apparently these wolves are capable of 35 feet leaps as well. You never get to see these incredibly obvious cgi wolves make the leap, but they do catch up to the remaining crew a day or so later.The rest of the movie is almost as bad, from unrealistic plot lines, to poorly written characters, to spotty acting, this movie fails in every aspect. I have really enjoyed Liam Neeson's work lately, and I'm surprised he would sign on, and do such a poor job on this film.There was one redeeming quality of this movie which was the exciting plane crash scene, but other than that this movie was a total waste of 2 hours, avoid it like the plague.",The Grey

However, this movie requires one to throw common sense, the laws of nature, physiology, and gravity out the airplane door. For what, I do not know. To fight the good fight? More like, make a good paycheck while making a really terrible movie.We have all seen enough nature programs, survival reality shows and Jackass stunts to pretty well understand what the basic truths of the world are. With that in mind, I will rattle off my list of, ""What? Really?""Liam is thrown clear of the plane wreck despite not just wearing one seatbelt, but two seatbelts! And damn, he's in one piece!The bite to Liam's leg is pumping blood as fast as the guy who just bled to death ten minutes earlier, yet he lives and the injury doesn't bother or slow him down at all.Despite being surrounded by wolves, the first guy killed decides that its still just fine to step into the darkness to take a pee.Liam decides that 'a forest' miles away is better protection from the wolves then the shelter and resources of the crashed plane. My vote, was to stay with the plane and the obnoxious cholo. And it was confirmed many times over throughout the movie.Lets collect the wallets. Um, why? It's not like they aren't going to find the wreck. Now the bodies don't have identification on the. (Side note: I guess I'm the only father who doesn't have pictures of my kids in my wallet.

The great wolf expert forgot his lessons from Wolf 101 - they pick off the wounded stragglers.In the forest, Liam comes up with some shotgun shell on a stick idea to use as a weapon. The cholo is right that it is ""McGuyver"". The obvious weapon was to take the big knives they were using and to tie them on the end of the sticks. It's called a spear. Works every time. Never during this whole stupid movie did they make a spear. ""So simple, even a caveman can do it!""We all know how far a person can jump. This movie apparently took place on the Moon as one guy jumped a gorge that Johnny Knoxville would say is impossible. And how about those wolves? They're already on the other side of the impassible gorge (took the tram, I guess). They're so inconsistent in their behavior, I began to wonder if they were bipolar. Maybe the ASPCA only allows wolves to hunt in movies for so many minutes a day because they sure weren't around much.

412,xolani-nene,Very Entertaining...,8,28 March 2012,"The Grey is a 2012 American thriller film directed by Joe Carnahan and starring Liam Neeson, Frank Grillo and Dermot Mulroney. The story follows a number of men stranded in Alaska after a plane crash, who are forced to survive using little more than their wits, as a pack of wolves stalks them. The storyline sound familiar but what makes this one different is the fact that you can feel the emotions, the fears and the thrills of the cat and mouse game as it unfolds in front of you, you feel the frustrations of the group as they are taunted and haunted by the beasts. The graphics are brilliant and are actually the highlight of the movie; you can actually feel the snow on your skin as it snows on the set. Liam proved once again acting is in his blood as he takes you in a journey of a man who is lost in Alaska and now is given a responsibility to make sure the group is safe as he is personally suffer from his demons.

The characters are being picked off one by one by a pack of wolves in a Darwinian model which punishes the weak. As you move along you realize everyone is going to get it at some point. In between each killing there is dialogue which adds some history and philosophy behind the characters. This becomes the true heart of the film and what lends it some merit.It's just too bad it is so absurdly unrealistic. The characters are starving and in sub-zero Alaskan weather at night after a horrific plane crash, yet they act like they're out on a night camping at the state park. At points they lay casually around ridiculously tiny fires ""talking shop"" with their jackets leisurely unzipped and not even their hoods on. Mere seconds after losing yet another friend to the wolves, they're not even scared they may re-attack. The wolves just magically back off and give them time to reflect on their lives and bond together. If you get wrapped up in how unrealistic it is then you are going to hate this film.

414,cory-huff3897,The Grey - A brutal fight for survival,8,21 June 2012,"Movies about plane crashes are largely to do with why I hate flying. The fear runs much deeper than just the crash itself: the fear is really what happens if I survive. I'm not much for survival skills in the event I should ever need them, so my only hope would be for someone else much more adaptable and knowledgeable also survives. But I guess if that survivor is Liam Neeson and you're stuck in the middle of the Alaskan wilderness, you could probably sleep a little easier knowing that, all things considered, it could be worse.The Grey is a thriller that really touches on the idea of survival in the face of insurmountable odds. Directed by Joe Carnahan, the film uses the title both as a description of the landscape the survivors are trying to escape, but also as the colors of their personalities seemingly working against them.Ottway (Neeson) is a hunter hired by oil companies to protect their men working in less than favorable conditions. He's not exactly thrilled with his job, and is haunted by the memories of a past lover. After a night at the bar, he hits rock bottom and nearly takes his life. Having reconsidered his suicide, he boards the plane that should take him, and a large portion of the rig crew, home. Something terrible happens during the flight, and the plane crash-lands in the middle of a blizzard. Ottway wakes up to discover he's one of 7 survivors, and that the rest of the crew either died in the crash or froze to death shortly there after. He also learns that he and his new friends are not alone in the wilderness. They're being hunted by a pack of wolves, and with each attempted attack, they are getting more brazen and more desperate.Director Joe Carnahan is very skilled at these kind of human dramas. He seems drawn to characters at war with themselves and their environments, but who seem to act in a way that society expects them to act. Neeson's portrayal of Ottway fits this to a T, and really helps the movie to shine. Here is a man, not hours before justifying his own death, now fighting to keep him and six other men alive. And the fact that a few of them are fighting him back, rather than fighting the elements or the ravenous wolves, is not making the situation any easier for him to navigate. Neeson fills this character with these very delicate moments of conflict and pain that really begin to emotionally resonate as his past is revealed through flashbacks and hallucinations. His companions are fleshed out as well through the campfire conversations and the inevitable battles for control they experience. While not as fully fleshed out as Ottway, the other survivors end up being more than wolf fodder, and really serve to invest you in their plight.The film, despite its bleak setting, is still beautiful and haunting to look at. The moments of quiet snowflakes falling are hypnotic, while the snowstorms and flashes of whiteouts are nerve racking. It's painted as a location that is meant to draw you in with its beauty, but as one that will rip you to shreds if you're not prepared. Speaking of shreds, the wolves are excellently utilized. Their sounds are present throughout most of the second and third acts and are a constant reminder of the threat that awaits these men. The moments they attack do end up being a bit telegraphed, but they are so visceral and brutal that you quickly forget whether or not you saw it coming.This is certainly not a movie for everyone. Anyone with a phobia of attacking dogs or wolves, survival situations, or plane crashes should probably stay away. The action is very primal and the violence could be unsettling, but never in a torture porn kind of way. It is never gratuitous for the sake of being so. This could have easily been a cheap, one off, creature feature type survival movie. But Joe Carnahan, and indeed the performance of Liam Neeson, brings a film with a lot more going on than what is on the surface. This is as much a human drama as it is a survival tale, and in the end is something to behold. It may not stick around with you by the next day, or even within the next few hours after watching it. But while you're watching, you are transported to a hell that will thankfully only exist in our nightmares. Well, for most of us at least.Follow me on Twitter @Mrhuffsmyfather",The Grey
415,ArtificialLuddite,Neeson + Wolves = Pretty Good,6,5 February 2012,"Once upon a time Liam Neeson only played priests and sombre leaders. Today he has transformed himself into a somewhat credible action star, to mixed results: his last movie Unknown was a nightmare although Taken was a sleeper hit and is highly regarded among college students and stoners across Ireland.The Grey is his latest offering and the plot is so deviously stupid that you can't help but wonder what two hours of Liam Neeson pitted against a pack of wolves would be like. Call me naive but I was expecting more.The whole affair starts well enough with a frightening plane crash in the wilds of Alaska. Those unlucky few to survive the crash soon realize they are not alone, and must help each other if they are to get out alive. Even though by the end of the movie I was looking at my watch and waiting for the remaining characters to be picked off so I could go home, I did enjoy The Grey.I mean, okay the premise is ridiculous, but Joe Carnahan never allows for his survival movie to take itself seriously. The script is solid, if not self-parodying at times, and allows the cast to get involved in some memorable exchanges. Neeson is also given free reign to deliver some wonderfully ludicrous lines, and follows up his hilarious appearance on Life's Too Short with another naturally comic turn.The Grey is wonderfully shot and looks great, and the barren windswept snow scape presented to us seems rather intimidating. Sadly, the wolves themselves are at times unconvincing, due to another unnecessary dependence on CGI.Even though this eventually degenerates into a tedious action flick, it is for the majority a big dumb action movie that is a lot of fun, and gives Neeson license to do what he now does pretty damn well. Beat the shite out of things.",The Grey
416,destroyah25,a must see in theaters,9,8 February 2012,"So review for the Grey. It was a very well done survival flick. You will be on the edge of your seat constantly and find yourself really caring about the people. Liam Neeson gives a perfect performance. There is very little wrong with this film, and would highly recommend it to anyone. There is a couple over the top moments, but it takes nothing away. The ending and bonus scene after credits are very well done also. I have seen similar movies in the past that are far from believable, and are sometimes hard to take seriously. This is not the case here as I believe I were actually in the party of people I would listen to all Neeson's ideas and follow him.Overall I rate this a 9/10",The Grey
417,pantelisandreou96,Frosty thriller with wolves!!!,7,18 May 2012,"Frosty survival thriller, with a superb Liam Neeson! Very reminiscent of the movie ""Alive"", except here they don't resort to munching on the second pilot. Set in the harsh landscapes of the Alaskan wilderness, we follow a group of plane crash survivors, as they struggle against the elements and unforgiving weather conditions - which is only worsened later on when a pack of wolves pick up their scent and go on the prowl to hunt them down. You can always count on Neeson to fight to the last breath though (he is, after all, the guy who trained both Batman and Obi-Wan Kenobi). His fully-fledged performance as oil driller John Ottway, makes the ""The Grey"" anything but dull and dramatically colorless. In terms of negatives, however, there were a few things that kept the film from greatness. One is the anti-climactic ending, which wrapped things up in a rather disappointing fashion. There was also a repeated sensation of déjà vu, as it follows all the typical clichés of other man vs. nature films. A re-hash without much originality. Regardless of this though, it remains a tight, suspenseful and skillfully directed action-drama, that keeps you at the edge of your seat for its entire duration. And if you didn't before appreciate the luxuries of a warm, cozy bed, I can personally guarantee that you will after this. 7/10",The Grey
418,RockStrongo,"Liam ""I'll do any old rubbish for a few bucks"" Neeson",2,29 December 2013,"I don't quite know how this movie manages to portray Liam Neeson as a heroic survival expert when all he seems to do is make a series of catastrophic mistakes that ultimately lead everyone (including himself) to be killed.For a start, in the immediate aftermath of the plane crash when he speaks to the dying man, does he comfort him by saying 'don't worry everything's going to be OK'? No, he tells the poor guy 'You're going to die, you'll never see your wife and children again'. Nice.He then persuades the other survivors to abandon the wreck of the plane, which could have provided some shelter from the elements as well as being visible from the air should a search and rescue mission be dispatched, and leads this group of ill equipped and injured men through a wolf infested wilderness in sub-zero temperatures. What could possibly go wrong? I'm not exactly Bear Grylls, but even I could see just how stupid this movie was from the outset. If you want to see an exciting survival adventure watch Touching The Void. But if you want to have a few beers on a Saturday night with your friends and play a 'who's going to get eaten by a wolf next' drinking game, then this is the movie for you...",The Grey
419,travola-35109,An excellent movie about death,10,31 August 2021,This movie is great. The ending is fine I guess people didn't get enough blood and guts. This movie is clearly about death and it's inevitably which is terrifying. The wolves represent death and look at how some characters experience their deaths in the film (the guy seeing his daughter).The death scene on the plane where you basically just watch a guy bleed out is haunting and will stick with you. Amazing film highly recommended but wouldn't recommend watching regularly.,The Grey
420,shannon_ranaweera,Overrated movie....,4,3 May 2012,"Considering some of the rating given for this movie on IMDb I can definitely say that its overrated. The Grey, has a very poor story line, quite a babyish plot and extremely poor character development.Firstly, the only character that the audience can relate to is Liam's. But that too is a little bit unbalanced for my liking. There are too many loose ends to this movie to be a good thriller/adventure. From the point of the plane crash the plot starts to appear dumb. Almost all of the survivors (who don't die soon after the crash) appear to have not a scratch on them. They don't draw up a plan but rather start blindly walking in a random direction to avoid wolves, who start killing the survivors one by one but does not eat the prey.None of the supporting roles are deep enough for the viewer to relate to them which makes the audience feel nothing when each of them die. Liam Neeson makes a hole in the wing of the plan using his pocket knife. They survive a snow storm by lying on the ground. The biggest challenge they face is to jump off a cliff to a tree which is 30 feet away !! (whose idea, I don't know). And lastly another person dies drowning in the river with water running 2 inches above his head just because his foot got stuck under a rock !!.I gave a few stars to his movie because its beautifully shot and some of the action sequences are a tad better than the script.Overall its a very mediocre movie.~Shannon",The Grey
421,frobin-jojo,"Weak screenplay, foreseeable, totally unrealistic.",1,15 April 2012,"The totally unrealistic portrayal of wolves is annoying, but not the most annoying thing with this really failed movie.The most annoying thing is that it want's to be some kind of thriller, but the screenplay is so bad written - the plot is so foreseeable ... sure it's a nice thrilling movie, but I (and I'm pretty sure everyone) always knew who's dying next and almost what's coming next and even the end of the movie is so foreseeable.The problem of this movie is that writer & director couldn't decide what kind of movie this should be, what genre ... an action-thriller: wolves against men in an extreme situation, just for the sake of action. Then it would even be OK that the wolves behave not like real wolves, but like some kind of humanized wolve monsters. Then it would be OK to have such bromidic dialogues and plain characters.ORa extreme situation drama based on the surviving characters: the photography /camera often fakes a character drama ... but the dialogues always stay bromidic. Even Ottway doesn't get very deep (even Liam Neeson can't make this weak screenplay better) ... it's closer to the action-thriller (but then it shouldn't be so foreseeable), but it always want's to claim some ""what's the true meaning of life"" and pessimistic/ melancholic death wish philosophy. But here it always stays so damn lukewarm.It's neither - nor ... so it's just a bad movie!",The Grey
422,SausagePourVous,"Close to a masterpiece. It's brutal,moving,haunting....and Grillos breakthrough.",9,19 May 2012,"A man who felt existence was pointless finds a bravery and strength within,determined and focused taping a knife to one hand,broken bottles to the other,about to face off against a equally focused,intimidating wolf. Another man,earlier claimed how bad he wanted to live,sits down on a log injured, calmly stating that his journey and his life will end here. Smiling,he reflects on his mundane,petty existence consisting of booze and work and realize that it's not all that. Pointing at the beautiful,snowy,landscape,he says-""I feel like that's all for me. How do I beat that. When will it ever get better?"" These two mens actions when it comes to facing their likely end are as different and far away from one another as possible. Yet they are the same. None of them is letting anyone else,not wolves,chance or fate choose their fate. They don't let death decide for them,this is on their terms. Man...what a punch. Right to my gut. No,it's not Taken 2 with Neeson fistfighting an organization of insane wolfes to get his daughter back...ya dummie. Carnahan tells this tragedy with a beautiful,visual clarity,an unsettling sense of real dread, patience and respect. Respect for death,our fear for it,for camaraderie,for our fate. The cinematographer from Warrior does an amazing job,there's always beauty...even when there's carnage.That's a big part here;contrasts or contradictions if you will. We are never more alive then when we feel death is close,our hearts pumping. When these men fight for their lives,hunted by The grey,they also,at every second,exist in The grey. You have the precious gift of life,the light within all of us,emphasized by the constant,white,bloodstained snow. Then you have the ugly,brutal,black beast(Wolfy)that is eternal death. And these men walk every step in the grey,with both feet in both worlds,as nature both becomes one enemy that spawns another. It's philosophical in a very primal,natural way,it won't raise any new questions about death but will deal with the timeless,painful ones in a very honest,dignified way. The unsentimental,though never detached or distant directing makes us feel like a part of the group in when the men conversate and in the presence of death,the likely topic will be life in all it's forms,all the little and big things we take for for granted;Sex,food,family,kids,every breath...and I found myself laughing when they did,knowing they may never laugh again. Yes,hypothermia would strike somewhat soon. Yes,Ottway should tell them to sharpen sticks. But wolves in a pack,as the tacticians they are,will either stay away...or move in for a slaughter if they feel threatened and outnumber men. One killed man in 100 years? Hehe,no,not correct.It's not a documentary,it's a tale of survival but Carnahan isn't completely off base. Like the wolves have an alpha who's challenged,so does the humans. Though the screenplay initially forces them against each other in a somewhat contrived manner (What do dead men need money for?),Neesons Ottway and Frank Grillos Diaz give us some of the films greatest moments. They have a lot in common,despite their clash.Diaz's friend just got chewed up but he's protecting his macho-ego with chestpuffing,swagger and knife cause that's all he has and knows. Until extreme circumstances make us see another side,or the side we saw hidden all along. Grillo. Impressive what a mustache and a tan can do physically. But internally,the actor from Pride and Glory and Warrior(Both Carnahan projects),who mostly has felt Very soap opera pretty boy to me(49 in June?Wow,decent genes.) pulls off something special,the transformation from a confrontational, dangerous liability to a man who lets go of pretends and posturing and opens up,earns our sympathy(plus makes a spectacular reflex redemption)is the surprise of 2012. Oscarnom? Best support so far. Dallas Roberts's Henrick is a sensitive,collected guy you just want to see survive. Mulroney is a likable everyday dad. Unfortunately,some of these 7 are too undeveloped. Another contrast,not perfect. With his superstar-status,Liam Neeson stands out,every now and again reminding us a bit too much that we're watching a film. Still,he has officially perfected the wise,bad-ass mentor/killer. He brings a bold,naked vulnerability to Ottway the bad-ass,making us at times wonder how good his advice is,considering his love for living. Oscarnom? Yeah,he's great.Suspense of disbelief has never been more approved by me then here. The animals represent death,period. Logic's not the point,just like the seconds after the credits roll are Secondary;the outcome's not what was important. Obviously.We'll do everything to survive but how will we handle the moment when we realize the good fight isn't gonna be won? Will we go out on our knees or on our feet? Is it about how long we live or how we punch out? The grey's a beautiful,raw,honest film. Let this one slide over ya.",The Grey
423,timmyjmcc,"The Grey ""Liam is at his best again!""",7,3 March 2012,"Some scripts are better than others, for example, Liam had a better script in Taken to work with than he did in the one that he did where he played a similar character who had that special killing and all knowing spy background where he's not sure of his identity what was the name of that one after taken guess it doesn't matter other than he is always great and sometimes his talents reach more people because of the movies he's in, and now comes The Grey. This isn't a praise all of Liam Neeson, despite that he's just totally awesome. It's about the movie starting now. Where to begin, how about the way it looks, grainy, gritty, great. The camera crew kept it alive and vibrant. The story. It's simple. A plane with a bunch of rough necks crashes, a half dozen or so survive the crash and they get picked off one at a time by wolves and during feeding sessions we find out a little about each one of them and get to know them a little. Period. The lead guy (liam) is of course the most flushed out character because he is just that, the lead character. We get the little surprise at end that his wife really didn't leave him on her own will, but she died. Not a bad twist, if this considered a twist, but it's interesting. What is more interesting- and I mentioned up top this is a definite spoiler alert – is that everyone dies, even the lead. This is something you'd see more in art house films, it's interesting in itself. The rescue chopper never landed, he didn't get taken to the hospital and his ex-wife didn't show up at his bed side and forgive the big lug for whatever he did wrong, it was she's dead, there's no rescue chopper, he's been through hell and back and now he's about to die as he prepares to fight the leader of the wolf pack. Obviously not a role for Bruce Willis, he always lives and gets back with the wife. But to The Grey. These guys just suffer the whole movie and die. Under the leadership and sound and experience advise of the lead (Liam), they leave the safety of the plane because it's too dangerous there, and head for the woods, where they die along the way, and then they all make up these wooden stick weapons and it only works one time, and more die, and then they cross over a river via tree tops to get away from the wolves, and one of the guys falls on the other side and guess what, there are wolves there, too, and he is eaten, and for the most part, not matter how much they try, they all get eaten. This is reality. This is what I like about the movie. That sometimes trying just isn't good enough and you're going to die anyway, but you still try and keep trying. I find this to be beautiful, that against all odds, they just keep on trying to the end, and the big Irishman, even though he knows for sure he's a gonna, and was suicidal a day earlier, is still going to fight to the end and try to take out the lead wolf before he is killed. I like the story and not because it's dark and gritty and doesn't have a happy ending but because of its 'as close to a Hollywood movie as possible' realism. The only thing that bothered me about the movie was in the last part of the movie, when there was only three guys left, and the one guy had enough, he found his peace, and this didn't bother me that he gave up, everyone reacts differently to different situations, he was done with it in his own way. This, or better yet, he didn't bother me, it was the other guy, who didn't say much earlier in the movie except a line or two here or there. I wish he had kept it that way. I felt like he wasn't believable. I believed every emotion in the movie until that guy did his little moment trying to convince the guy (Diaz) to get up and keep going. It was so weak, I don't blame the guy for not getting up. If I was sitting on that log and that guy delivered his speech to me in the way he did it, I would have also stayed behind. The guy's speech was so week! The delivery was not up to snuff with the rest of the acting. It felt wrong. Even when he does his little motivational moment, Liam's character says nothing, as if, I don't want to prolong this scene any longer. The Diaz character played it perfect, but the other guy, in his big moment, didn't convince. It became painfully obvious that he didn' t belong in that group. Was he supposed to be a white collar engineer effeminate guy that didn't belong in that company? If that was the ticket, they should have made it clearer. Or at least had him do something earlier that did something to strengthen or define his character. When he did his thing there near the end of the movie, I had zero belief that Diaz would get up. The motivating character was so lame in his speech, it just ruined the pitch perfect acting of the movie. With the exception of the characters work in that scene, it's two thumbs up on The Grey, and Liam Neeson.",The Grey
424,maxwell3977,"Plane crashes in middle of nowhere, survivors have to walk a great distance to safety, hunted by wolves from start to finish",2,26 February 2012,"Dreadful film how this has got a 7.6 overall rating is a mystery to me, I am starting to think film companies are hiring people to write false reviews to boost the score. A brief synopsis is basically a group of oil field workers in ALASKA (I think) board a plane to go back home to there families, on route the plane crashes in the middle of nowhere and the survivors have to start walking as apparently nobody will find them. Pretty soon in the film you relise Liam Neesons character is the most pesimistic depressing bloke you could ever wish to survive a plane crash with, his job at the oilfield was to protect the workers from the local wildlife and very soon after the crash the wolves make an appearance and the survivors are now prey to these very nasty wolves. After Liams speech and a mauling all are agreed to get out the area sharpish and we follow these characters along the way to safety with the wolves in hot pursuit. Without Liam Neeson who I personally think is a great actor this movie could have went straight to DVD, the fundamental flaw for me is as far a I am aware wolves are not dangerous to humans, therefore its really hard to take the threat seriously. I found the film very unrealistic, boring, very predictable and comical. In parts it was just silly for example the crazy decision to jump from a cliff edge to the top of a huge tree with some rags attached to the first jumper so the rest of the gang could shimmy along it and climb down the tree, why they could not just continue walking down the mountain who knows, maybe they are adrenaline junkies. If i could compare this film I would say its a similar storyline to THE EDGE which starred Anthony Hopkins, only difference being the edge had a huge grizzly bear hunting them and was actually a descent film. I can honestly say this is one of the worst films I have seen in a long time purely because of the hipe and the IMDb rating which I use quite often to decide if i want to go to the cinema to watch it, thats why I am a bit annoyed the grey has such a high rating. Only redeeming features are you get to see some wolves which are fantastic animals and the scenery is impressive only reason I gave it 2 rather than 1 out of ten. REALLY Disappointing!",The Grey
425,lordsong-918-188748,Unrealistic movie and bad reviews,6,28 April 2013,"Some reviewers claim that the negative reviews were exaggerated and demonstrated poor knowledge of wolves etc. Not quite.One writes for example, --""People surviving plane crashes: Really happens;""Sure, and? Where & when? In the wild in winter? Not likely.How many people do you know of that survived plane crashes in Alaska in winter, in the middle of nowhere, with no food? Again, rather unlikely.--""Sleeping outside in the cold: Really happens, in fact I have been to several winter survival schools, we do it all the time, it happens without fire too;""Definitely not in high north winters unless you have the right clothing and protection. And even then your chances of being alive come morning are very slim.Temperatures in the Alaskan interior in winter can go to -60 regularly. At -60, if you spit, your spit will freeze before it touches the ground. If there's wind the chill factor can easily push the -60 to -75.Many people have frozen to death, in much higher temps -even when well dressed.No one sleeps outdoors like in the movie, in the high north in winter. Alaskan temps average -30 to -50. Its insane to try -unless you have the exact proper equipment designed for such -special tents, sleeping bags, clothing and heat source. Otherwise forget it, you're dead, period.A person can freeze to death in less than 10 min in -35 if not properly clothed. I live just below the 50th parallel and anyone stupid enough to try to sleep outside in just -30 is dead before morning without proper shelter, clothing, heat source of some kind ....Also - Nothing is worse in such cold than being wet. Water would freeze on you in less than 5 seconds. And your skin would freeze with it. Hypothermia would kill you in less than 10 minutes if you don't get dry and warm immediately.Hypothermia can kill you even at temps around 40deg F.--""Wolves: if you are threatening a wolf it will kill you.""No one in this movie was threatening wolves. Wolves were threatening them just for being there. Wolves in the high north of north am, rarely attack humans like that unless they're starving, rabid or you're viewed as a danger to their young -as was not the case in the film.Wolves track and kill for food. They don't kill to kill and leave the carcass. Only rabid wolves -or rabid anything for that matter- would do that. So, the behavior of the wolves in the movie is highly exaggerated and highly unlikely, especially not facing 7 adult men.Wolves are still very dangerous animals and not to be taken lightly, especially by just 1 or 2 persons encountering several wolves with young or while they're eating their prey. A person in either case needs to be prepared to fight. -Don't run, they'll run faster. -Make yourself look as large as possible -open coats, raise back pack above head etc. -Avoid eye contact, -Don't smile (show your teeth). Having a good weapon on hand -gun, long knife, ax, large staff or club, bow & arrows -a good idea in places where you're likely to meet wolves.Wolves -even lone wolves- will however attack small persons -especially kids- i.e. don't bring kids along where you could meet wolves.Much worse though are bears. They are far more likely to attack you just for being there. And they can kill you very easily.Should have been a bear movie. This was supposed to be a realistic survival film, not a fantasy, comedy and almost certainly not an ""psychological allegory"". Whatever, like it or don't, good acting by Neeson for sure. Nice photography too.",The Grey

This movie seemed to have multiple climaxes and the ending was exactly what it should have been, which is why it gets 9/10. The plane crash scene was excellent and is superior to the one in Castaway in every shape or form. Liam does his thing as usual and is the alpha male in this film, a role he is unmatched in.

427,toygun_999,Seven little Greys and the wolves...,5,25 September 2012,"If the producers of this movie had chosen a cougar or a bear instead of wolves it would have been more sensible.I understand the film makers trying to be original and dramatic(they did succeed somehow on the latter), they don't want to use bears as the antagonist beast, since it was already done (The Edge?), but wolves make a bad choice as realistic and cunning man b-eaters.Zoologists will tell you animals -contrast to solo hunters- which hunt in packs are usually one thing: on a singular one-on-one basis, i.e. the animal which compose the pack, is usually weak on its own, as it's too small on average to tackle a man sized prey. Of course, a pride of lions is an exception here. Using a big cat (cougar) would have made more sense.The psychological reaction of the wolves toward the protagonists (cruelty) were overly silly; it didn't have the intended effect to be frank. Finally, there is also the ridiculously exaggerated size of the wolves, even dire wolves were marginally bigger than the largest modern grey wolf.However, on a positive note, the acting was generally good (Liam Neeson), and in spite of the story being wasted on a bad premise, as an over all verdict, the movie was not that bad.If you like tension with elements of suspense and big bad ""wolfies"", I recommend it.

He leaves a guy behind to die with no real attempt to encourage the man to go on. He kills the wolf in the end I think, but this should have been a savage fight scene instead of the movie ending as he charged.

Neeson plays Ottway, a loner and self reserved type. He hunts animals for a living, namely Wolves. Fast forward a bit, he and a few dozen others get on a plane leaving to Alaska. Needless to say, the plane goes down (in one of the greatest plane going down scenes ever) and crash lands in a remote area in Alaska. This is where it all starts. Man vs Wolf. Life vs Death. The events that transpire throughout the whole movie is bone chilling and nerve wrecking. I won't say much. But you'll find yourself wondering, pondering, and just thinking deep thoughts about life and how to live it. Especially towards the end.

430,KostersK,Much better than expected! Highly recommended!,7,19 March 2012,"No one wants to die, well I suppose there are those few, but most do not. Even more than that, there are those few ways that most would not wish to die from. These ways would include death by fire, or by a pool of acid, slow intricate torture, but one in particular is death by slow painful ripping and tearing of your own flesh and bones. The fear of this is what fuels the fears and the suspense of stories about zombies, or sharks, or in The Grey's case, wolves. I wouldn't say the film is one of those niche fear films that targets those with particular phobias regarding wolves, but if you have such a phobia, good luck! I came into watching this film with average to poor expectations of the movie and left feeling quite good about it. I think both the story and the acting were well done. One thing I will note regarding the CGI, or visual effects, used to make the wolves is I think in a few years they will look rather funny and off. While watching, they already seemed overly soft and dark. They had an almost blurred look to them at times. Certain movies like, Jurassic Park, or The Thing(the original) may not look fantastic these days, but still look pretty darn good compared to the aging of computer special effects. But hey! Maybe I will be wrong, luckily either way, the CGI is not what made this film.

431,mekane,This Movie is a Lie,4,13 July 2012,"I expected good things from this movie. I respect Liam Neeson both as a gifted actor and as somewhat of an action star, so I was primed to like The Grey. Unfortunately, it failed to deliver in any meaningful way.The intro was nice and bleak, but didn't really follow through. We were only given a few glimpses of the desperate nature of life on the rig (or wherever the hell they were) - not enough time to empathize with our protagonists motivations. From then on, it was mostly cliché, mixed with an unrealistic portrayal of the Wolves.*** I shall now describe my disappointment with the Wolves *** Really, I would have been fine with the wolves just being a faint howling in the distance. That was creepy enough. The few shots of wolves running straight towards the characters in the haze of snow were all the creep factor I needed. Instead, we had ""Jaws"" with a Wolf's head. I actually got tired of seeing the wolves, and wished we had a few more ""glowing-eyes-from-the-darkness"" moments. The parts where the Wolves howled ""messages"" from just over the rise were really outstandingly ridiculous. At a certain point in the movie I realized that the Wolves were just another force of nature. They were just as meaningless and uncaring as the wind, cold, and snow. They appeared from out of nowhere and struck with equal randomness. Thus the ending was both completely rational and completely dissatisfying. P.S. Was anyone else thrown off and/or bothered by the transition to higher-speed film and color as the party progressed through the wilderness? I was nearly driven to distraction.",The Grey

433,zetazap8,Into the Grey - More Than Meets the Eye,6,16 March 2015,"I like a good adventure story, with an emphasis on ""story"". This movie is worth watching with a critical eye. As the movie opens, we find a man, Ottway, mourning his late wife. His job is set in Alaska, working at an oil refinery, killing wolves that threaten the workers in the field. His life no longer means very much to him; he's empty inside, and doesn't have any reason to go on living. I think Liam Neeson saved the movie, the other acting was not very impressive, with some characters playing the stereotypical ""yahoo"" oil rigger. Wolves can be dangerous, but the ferocity of these wolves in attacking humans really lacks credibility. ""Eye roll"". That someone can fall into a river in the dead of winter, fully clothed and not freeze to death without building a fire also is very hard to believe. And when one of the characters is crossing the chasm on a rope, he looks over his shoulder down at the chasm....and loses his glasses! REALLY??! Everyone knows - you don't look down! Especially in a movie! And, as people call to him to keep going, he grows confused and slows down....Of course - anyone with glasses knows that you can't hear as well when you don't have your glasses on....! (LOL)Are the wolves an analogy for Fear in general? Aren't we all fighting some kind of fear? For Ottway's grief? What does ""The Grey"" refer to? That the whole movie is dark and gloomy? I don't know. It IS noticeable that the only truly bright scenes are when Ottway is having a flashback of lying next to his dying wife. I think it's worth examining the question of what is it about Ottway that makes him a leader? It's ironic that he is a profoundly sad man, and yet he's the only one to think about everyone else. I think the question of mortality is important to think about - how we live, and how we die; what is the meaning of our having lived? Did we do something that made the world a little better? The poem is a key motif for a deeper understanding of the story. I believe that the author was trying to say something profound, but the story falls short in conveying this. For the most part, I think too much of the dialogue goes something like this: Human: Man, it sure is cold. Wolf: Grrrr! Human: I don't think we're going to make it... Wolf: Grrrr! Rowr! GRRRR! Human: Aaaaeeeiiii! This movie was a little too existential for this reviewer to truly enjoy. However, it is believed by some, that because it ends in a similar way to how it begins - showing the rise and fall of the breathing of the dying wolf, that somehow Ottway kills the alpha wolf, conquers his fears and is found because of the beacon (otherwise, why show it?). He finds his way back into the Light, and leaves the Grey. It is, indeed, the last good fight he'll ever know.",The Grey

Even then I thought the film was extraordinary. I didn't really know why. 10 more laps around the sun I consider this film to be a highly underrated masterpiece! Liam Neeson in his parade role and Frank Grillo with a lifetime performance.The film matures with age and it is a poem about the average man in today's world. In truth, it is not about a struggle for survival in the icy wilderness fighting wolves, this is just the part that is supposed to entertain. This film is a single metaphor and tribute to the garbage man, the coal worker, the soldier, the janitor, the truck driver and warehouse worker, the mechanic, the construction worker and, of course, the oil production worker himself as well as millions other men who does the dirty work out there so that we have time here to review this film.Men with daughters and sons whom they hardly see, but for whom they sacrifice so much, out of the need to do so. Whereby the wolves to me, are the manifestation of the unexpected suffering that can overtake them every day at any time while doing the above dirty work. From a physical and psychological point of view, facing the constant pressure and at times hoplessness. Stand up and stare back into the eyes of the unknown dangers of everyday life.All characters can even be seen as one man, in different phases of life, who can be hit by inevitable stroke of fate or death for different reasons. Be it out of courage, cockiness, carelessness, ignorance, giving up or even simply bad luck. All the Oddways of life.It is a film with so many layers that it would go beyond the scope describing them all. Mortality and the awareness of your own mortality are two completely different things. It's about faith and in it's core about the very meaning of life. What is it that lets you go Once More Into the Fray? ... repeat!",The Grey
435,ckdos2,This is the biggest WOLF LIE movie ever.,1,7 February 2015,"Ridley Scott, Liam Neeson and a sensationalist short story writer created this alarming existential version of 'Little Red Riding Hood'. Liam being Red who meets the Big Bad Wolves and learns nothing in the end except that not doing your wildlife homework and making up your own scientific theories gets you bad reviews and low ratings.'The Grey' opens in Alaska with Liam's voice over telling us that his fellow oil workers are men unfit for mankind: fugitives, drifters and general assholes. Then we see their drunken bar brawl of waste and indulgence. We will later hear that one of these so call misfits considers himself superior to his last screw job which was a fifty-three year old, fat, half Eskimo woman. This common 'John' places himself above a prostitute as if it doesn't take two to tango.Next Liam shoots a Grey wolf as it runs through the oil fields trying to eat the oil workers. This flash of concocted nonsense is ludicrous because no wolf in its right mind would EVER attempt such a stupid move. Wolves are shy creatures that hide in the woods fearing for their lives if they even get one scent of a human. So why would a wolf sniff around in a camp full of those pesky rifle toting humans? Thousands of years of canine evolution tell the wolf that humans are the most dangerous animal. Wolves are not stupid, and besides they could smell the camp latrine miles away.For 'The Grey' to work, the Big Bad Wolf of our childhood must be dredged up and the FEAR shoved down our throats again despite the fact that in American history not one documented wolf has attacked a human minding their own business. 'The Grey' is a Wolf Witch Hunt that limps across the frozen January screen in a bandage until the climax when Liam tries to kill a wolf that isn't there. It isn't there because after taking one look at Liam with his face contorted into a madman grimace and glass taped onto his waving hands, the terrified wolf would have split immediately to hide under the nearest rock.The biggest sham of all is the Wolf Den Motif. The Alpha Female only dens in the warm spring to deliver her litter who soon leave the den to learn from the pack. Wolves are first cousins to the Artic Husky which burrows under the snow for warmth and wolves do the same. THERE WAS NO DEN and the thirty mile radius attack theory is a lie made up to support the ridiculous Wolf Den Nonsense just like Liam when he states: 'Wolves are the only animal that seeks revenge'...ridiculous. More exact, only humans seek revenge; wolves live in the moment.Then we have the plane crash and the sham of wolves attacking a man and biting him in the leg and eating the other, which holds about as much scientific authority as the town gossip. Wolves would NEVER come near humans with fire. The Cave Men had fire too and wolves have had thousands of year of 'stay away from the crazy humans' experience. Why didn't Ridley just dig up Jeffrey Dahmer and have Jeffy Boy chase the crash survivors around with a meat cleaver? Now that would have been a true scientific fact.Starving wolves might scavenge a dead human carcass, but would never approach a live human with a twisted Freddy Kruger face. You can scare away coyotes and wolves with just a clap of your hands, and the Alpha sending in the Omega is a sham too. The truth is an Alpha would NEVER go in much less a scared Omega, and being an Alpha has noting to do with size, just ask five-foot-two Napoleon.'The Grey' is an ANIT-ENVIRONMENTAL film that has no redeeming wildlife truth or enlightening value. Well..O.K., Liam beat up the human Werewolves and this is what 'The Grey' is really about, not the real life wolf that God created. Once again the wolf is a victim of human greed and ignorance. Everything bad that happens to the men is caused by the wolves...how dumb. Why blame it on the wolves? How about the stupidity of boarding a rickety old airplane in the dead of an Alaskan Winter? Isn't that enough conflict for a truly creative writer to gather on? Wouldn't a better name for 'The Grey' be: Albert Camus and the Werewolves?What makes the produces and writers of this movie any better than the greedy corporations that destroy our environment? Another 'I Hate Wolves' movie is made as this magnificent animal is once again massacred into near extinction. Our own Federal Department of Fish & Wildlife Service and hunters in America practice anti-wolf politics. They trap, poison and chase the wolves down with snowmobiles and helicopters and shoot them at close range like small, cowardly self deluded hunters and thanks to movies like 'The Grey,' they now have deranged fodder for their reckless wolf slaughter.Wolf haters use extermination excuses like 'wolves kill caribou and leave none for us to shoot,' but the truth is that wolves are too slow paced and lack the stamina to run down a healthy caribou. Farley Mowat, environmentalist, who spent years in the Artic, concluded this when he lived among the wolves and wrote 'Never Cry Wolf' (also a movie, 1963). He says that wolves' diet consists mostly of small game like rodents or hares and if a wolf brings down a caribou it is only because the caribou is sick, injured or old.The 'California Wolf Center' and The 'International Wolf Center' provide hundreds of books and DVDs on true wolf behavior. Farley Mowat went on to quote: 'Humans doom the scapegoat wolf into a mythologized epitome of a savage, and a ruthless killer when the real savage killer is man himself'.",The Grey

In addition to that, we can learn that being pessimistic is something bad, always we have to try to be positive, see the life in an optimistic view, this will automatically encourage us and motivate us to do our best, the guy that surrendered lost his life just because of his negative view. Always be positive, motivate yourself, don't lose the hope, be a source of positivity and positive energy to all who are around you, and the MOST IMPORTANT lesson from this movie, always trust and believe in God, he is always there, watching, caring and saving, believe in him then in yourself, and your life would be great one.

To give you a flavour without spoiling it (if that is possible), our hero survives the plane crash in the Alaskan blizzard, it's snowing and -15 degrees. By a stoke of luck his suitcase is just a few feet away, not scattered two miles distant. He opens it and gets out the woolly hat that his gran must have knitted, and puts it on. Well that will help. Apparently it does! Terrible.The winners are the Hollywood wolves. I'm not expecting a documentary on wolf behaviour but at least give me something that I could remotely believe in, they are just so tremendously awful.

441,Stevendcravens,"An incredible film! Thank you, Joe Carnahan!",10,28 January 2012,"When I first heard Joe Carnahan was doing a movie about survivors from a plane crash being stalked by wolves I got excited. After all I liked The A-Team and Smokin' Aces very much. Then I heard he cast Liam Neeson in the lead and my interest REALLY jumped up a few notches. And finally came January 27th when I sat down and watched the film opening night with a sold out audience...and I walked out stunned. I adored this film. It was everything I wanted it to be and more. Everything from the directing, cinematography, musical score, writing, sound design and the acting was top notch. I have never seen an action/horror film that legitimately had me on the edge of my seat, praying that nothing bad would come to any of the characters on screen. The wolves here are played out for us as some of the most terrifying screen monsters ever to grace cinemaplexes. They are TERRIFYING. Every time you hear a wolf howl in the darkness your heart will skip a beat. Liam Neeson absolutely OWNED his role as John Ottway, the alpha of the group. Every single line he speaks is delivered with the utmost sincerity its easy to forget he's simply speaking written dialogue. The man is a true actor and I am glad he is finally getting the recognition and popularity he deserves. I cannot stress enough how much you MUST, absolutely MUST see this at the cinema with an audience. Everything from the wolf attacks, character deaths, the plane crash and the powerful monologues delivered by the characters will be that much more powerful, especially the last 5 minutes. Please go see this film. You will not regret it at all! P.S. Thank you, Joe Carnahan and co. for one hell of a film!",The Grey

A plane loses power and everyone's breath is visible but no one is concerned. The plane is going down and the flight attendant is still walking the isle? After the crash, is a clearly snow covered, desolate area there are several survivors. All of a sudden the first wolf scene has trees magically appearing in the barren landscape. Next one of the most outlandish scenes has the few remaining fashion a rope from whatever then ask a volunteer to jump 30' from a cliff, across a river, and land in trees without injury. These guys are not Rambo, and no way can one jump from this cliff and make it to the other side, in a tree.Then there is the scene in the river where Liam is trying to rescue a drowning victim. There is no way one can survive the frigid river then walk out, lay down and then get up again without sever hypothermia.And, last but not least, Liam stumbles upon the wolf den. My question is: are these new wolves who've changed color or did the pack following them manage to jump of a cliff, swim across the river and beat Liam to their den?",The Grey
443,samhandymusic,It's not about the realism,10,18 February 2020,"There's something about this movie that really moves me, and chills me every time. It's not about the realism, because this isn't meant to be real. From the first scene in the aftermath of the plane crash, Liam Neeson's character is separated from the rest of them. This is surely evidence enough, so do I need to go on about the improbabilities and impossibilities in this film?
It's a film about sin. 7 being the number. The wolves are an analogy for the punishment they're meant to face. Each of them with a secret, and a past they regret. The wolves are handled so well. The psychological fear is developed with the viewer so effectively and so unpredictably!",The Grey

445,recoltes,Greys Lobotomy,5,7 February 2012,"Enjoyed aspects of this movie such as the acting, the survival theme and the scenery. The story line however was full of foolishness on behalf of the characters. Nobody checks the reception of their cell/mobile phone or the radio in the cockpit of the plane after the crash. The collecting of the wallets of the dead as though they were dog tags was pointless when the manifest of the plane minus any survivors would have identified the dead. With the movie finishing in the wolves den the theme could have more accurately been the path to self destruction as opposed to survival.Alternatively by subtracting how long they were into the flight from how long the flight should have been they could have calculated where they had crashed. Given that there were aggressive wolves in the area they should have discounted escape over open country. Better to circle the wagons and dig in at the wreck site. They should have sealed off an area specifically for sleeping and used the clothes etc. from cargo as insulation. This area should be no bigger than necessary for the seven survivors to make use of body warmth. They could have viewed the wolf pack as a food source to be lured into bear pits dug around the wreck. They should then have waited on the search and rescue teams that would be searching the flight plan of the downed aircraft for wreckage and survivors.As it is this movie works best as a guide on what-not-to-do if stranded in Alaska and being preyed on by wolves.",The Grey
446,Eelsdownyourleg,117 minutes of your life you will never get back,1,3 September 2012,"I hardly ever bother to review films - but after watching 'The Grey' I feel compelled to.This is the most relentlessly depressing gash I've had the misfortune to witness for a considerable time. It's filled with thoroughly unlikable characters, you couldn't give a flying f*** about. A story line that has been played out so many times before, but so much better and the end result is a ridiculous, pretentious load of twaddle.The worst part of 'The Grey' is that it appeals to the optimist side of the viewers nature, in that at some point it will get better (naturally it does the opposite), therefore the urge to turn it off is thwarted and you end up watching this t**d right 'til it's dismal conclusion....and then thoroughly wishing you hadn't.People who enjoy this will point out that's it's not really a survival story, it's a metaphor for life and the circling wolves are a metaphor for something other - honestly who gives a cr*p?It's a miserable load of nihilistic nonsense - there are so many laughably ridiculous parts I wouldn't even know where to begin.Suffice to say, do yourself an enormous favour and give this a wide berth.Liam Neeson is doing some truly awful films these days...Afterlife, The A Team...but this tops them all...how the cast and crew managed to complete this doom laden sludge is a mystery in itself.Spend 117 minutes doing something else...like watching grey paint dry for example; you'll have a better time.",The Grey
447,golfer06,Don't mess with the Alpha,7,28 February 2012,"The Grey (2012) tells the tale of a group of oil drillers who after a plane crash find themselves in the middle of the Alaskan wilderness fending for survival in freezing temperatures with threatening wolves. The premise offers enough for a good watch. Liam Neeson doesn't disappoint. Like his performances in Taken and Unknown, you get absorbed in whatever character he plays. When he plays Ottway, the wolf hunter, you want to know more about him.In the beginning, he is depressed over the loss of his wife, and even leads him to try to end his life. But the wolves howling in the distance stops his finger from pressing the trigger. It's like the wolves are taunting him and want to see what this wolf hunter is about. Too bad he doesn't because it would save him a lot of pain. But their wouldn't be a movie if he did. So he goes on a plane and it crashes and the movie really begins.There's a few things that I didn't believe to be possible. One was the plane crash. How is Ottway perfectly fine, totally away from anyone else? This was not believable. But whatever, lets continue. When the first wolf attacks, that's really when the suspense starts and you are on the edge of your seat the entire rest of the movie. The danger becomes real and life threatening for the remaining survivors.I was really absorbed during this part of the movie and you can really feel your heart pounding a little harder. You start to feel for the characters more and want them to survive. You start to put yourself in their shoes. Well I did anyway.With great suspense the group of survivors finally somehow make it from the wreckage to the woods with more people killed on the way. When they circle the fire, waiting, I thought Director, Joe Carnahan, did a good job of trying to get to know the survivors. They tell small stories about their lives and it kinda humanizes them into actual people with lives and not as only survivors.Then the film picks up with added suspense that continued to put me on the edge of my seat. Though some parts may seem questionable as to what is possible and not, I didn't really care. I just wanted to know if someone could actually survive.The ending brought up this point. Will Ottway (Neeson) survive? From his other movies I thought he always survive. But the way the writers made Ottway out to be, I thought the ending was fitting. Overall, I thought the film was good. It did its job of being suspenseful and my blood was definitely pumping. Though there are times of whether certain parts were believable, it was overshadowed by the action. I thought Liam Neeson did a good job and looking forward to more performances from him.",The Grey
448,m_antrim1,Completely ridiculous!,1,1 July 2012,"This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever watched. Not one aspect of the movie was factually accurate and it generally defied all common sense when it comes to wilderness survival. First, I work in the oil fields of Alaska - the fields are located on flat tundra where there are no trees. The camps do not allow alcohol, and, in fact, the entire North Slope is 'dry.' The idea that the oil companies would employ a person to outright kill any wild life is, in itself, ridiculous. The companies, contrary to popular belief, are environmentally aware and sensitive to something like arbitrary shooting wolves. There are no wolves on the Slope, either, yet another small point. The only jobs remotely like the one depicted in the film are 'bear guards,' staff who keep a look-out for polar bears on the coastal sites. Their job is primarily to warn staff at risk should a bear be sighted in the area so the people can get to safety. Only as a last resort do the 'bear guards' haze the bears to scare them off by firing cracker rounds that make a loud popping sound so the bear is startled and moves away. The first rule of wilderness survival in a situation depicted in the movie is to stay put. In a place as large and remote as the north country search and rescue crews are often looking for a needle in a haystack. This problem is only made worse by moving. The best strategy is always to stay put at the last known location, i.e., where radio contact was lost, unless there is some overriding safety concern, like the entire area being on fire. There is, of course, the added issue that all jets of the type depicted, most likely the Boeing 737, have transponders that aid search and rescue crews to the crash sites. Apparently the movie maker/script writer have never heard of the proverbial 'black boxes.' Anyway, the longest this group would have waited at the crash site with a plane of that size over a standard air route is probably about 2-hours. Again, another reason to stay put.I won't even get into the issues with the movie's depiction of wolf behavior. I can only imagine that the director and producer of this dog (no pun intended) are on the lists of the number of pro-wolf organizations. This movie only set back their efforts to educate people about wolves, by, I don't know, about 200-years!The plot shortfalls are numerous, but I'll only deal with the one that caused my wife and I to burst out laughing. So, the surviving members of the group decide that they have to rope themselves over a ravine to get away from the wolf-pack which has followed them to the edge of a ravine. So they get away dramatically going hand-over-hand over the ravine. After all that - the wolves drag away one of their injured party once they're on the other side. I thought the whole point was, well, never mind.Lastly, what is the deal with filming Alaska movies in . . . Canada. Just set the damn thing in Canada. No big deal.",The Grey
449,rurick,Unrealistic on all accounts,4,16 June 2012,"As soon as they survived the crash I had problems. All that metal, tubing, wiring, and they did not use any of it to make weapons. Ottway had 12 Ga shotgun shells for a rifle. I kept shouting - find the rifle!! When he did - he threw it away even though he could have used it. Why go to the trees when they had the plane's wreckage for shelter? If they had a knife - make spears once in the trees. I would have had a bunch of them with me. - Maybe even a bow to extend my reach. When the storm started - make a shelter, with punji stakes all around. How did the wolves ( presumably the same ones that stalked them) get down the cliff, and if that was their den at the end - how did they climb up to begin with. AND why would the wolves go up to the tundra when they had a den next to the river in the forest?? AND of course - no guns or knives are allowed in carry on. I've traveled too much and spent too much time in wilderness environments to forget what I know and just enjoy the movie.",The Grey
450,Smacki,This film is something of an enigma.,7,25 August 2012,"This film is something of an enigma. It has possibly the most stupid premise of any movie ever. Yet in spite of this, it manages to be beautiful, captivating, thrilling, thought provoking, and touching.I was worried that I wouldn't enjoy this film because of the unrealistic portrayal of wolves. Admittedly the wolves are the worst bit; not only do they behave in an unrealistic manner (for any animal lacking walkie-talkies), they are also poorly animated. But don't let that put you off. The protagonists have more to face than just wolves. There is the bitter cold, the treacherous wilderness, and their own despair at their situation. Even if you edited out all the parts with wolves, this would still be a great film about survival against the odds.Liam Neeson's acting is amazing, but he is not alone. The entire supporting cast is great. The characters are deep and fleshed out. The scenes are powerful, suspenseful and dramatic. The cinematography and editing are both superb. As is the music.The wolves didn't bother me too much in the end. I started to view them more as a generic antagonist, necessary in order to tell a deeper human story. It didn't have to be wolves, it could have been aliens, monsters, cannibals etc... I find it ironic that so many commenters have felt the need to proclaim how ""Wolves wouldn't behave like that, it is unrealistic"" so it is a bad film. Yet you rarely see people complain in sci-fi films that ""Aliens don't really exist it's unrealistic!"" or ""travelling beyond the speed of light is impossible, it's unrealistic"". In the end these things don't have to be realistic, they are just props to tell a story. Who knows? maybe there is a species of huge killer wolf out there in the wilderness, waiting to be discovered? It's probably a lot more likely than Aliens attacking us (which apparently no one minds).If you are thinking of renting this film and not sure what to expect. I would say it has a lot in common with other survival films like Alive and The Road. Though perhaps not quite as shocking as those two. If you are a fan of Liam Neeson you will will surely like this, and he plays an Irishman which is nice.I'd give this film a 7. It is well made and I enjoyed it, despite the wolves being a bit silly.",The Grey
451,diogompm,Survival,5,19 June 2012,"When i first saw the trailer and red the intro it seemed frankly bad. The only thing that actually made me want to see it was my passion for survival stories.-The Bad: This movie kinda inspires that its all about a survival story and so people would be expecting some more realistic survival techniques and less ""common sense breaking moves"". Rather unrealistic behaviors by the wolfs;-The Good: The movie does have a great sentimental component which in my opinion was well written and very well explored. The story it self feels sound and you can relate to some situations the characters go through;Overall i wouldn't recommend this movie in general, but it is easy to see and ends up not being such a cliché as you might have first though. It lacks in realism and will make many people go ranting on about all the survival guide mistakes. If you already saw every thing give it a chance, it will entertain.",The Grey

The survivors are remotely stranded and have to get to safety because wolves are lurking around (I think they cast small ponies looking at the size of them.) As luck would have it, a depressed Liam Neilson is with the survivors and his job is killing wolves. Not everyone will agree with the decisions made, but here is what the trailers don't state enough. There is almost edge of your seat worry with what will happen next because of the bleakness of the situation and the dangers that pop up. They got the balance just right with plot progression and suspense. The reason I only gave it a 7 is because much like a Jason Stathem film, I couldn't hear what Liam Neilson was mumbling when he was talking. That and I didn't really have any empathy towards the survivors. From start to finish, Liam also has flashbacks which don't add anything to the film and get pretty annoying.All in all I would recommend watching this. It's well shot and quite raw and real.

Then the wolves appear and they are like something out of a new version of little red riding hood. Closeups of their faces show highly intelligent, cunning eyes and they just looked fake. This is an example of a gross misuse of CGI...when the entire rest of the film is shot to look realistic you can't have a 'realistic' creature that does not look real.

Now, while that simple description does roughly cover the movie, it really does not do it full justice.For such a seemingly simple concept, there is a surprising amount of depth to this movie. While the characters are not all that well fleshed out, the acting is quite solid so you still do manage to get a sense of them as individuals and there are some small glimpses into their lives here and there that give perspective on their motivations as they struggle to continue living.This movie is not a fancy exercise of intricate story telling. The plot is very simple. But even so, it is striking and forceful. In the scene where the plane crashes, there's an incredibly visceral feel to it that I've not experienced in many other films. I've seen a lot of movies where they use erratic sound and jarring camera angles with frantic jump cuts to convey a sense of panic and confusion, but nothing like this. In fact, there are multiple scenes within the movie that just forced me to react because they just seemed so convincing as a result of good directing and cinematography.To be clear: this is a movie for the guys. It's not a feel good affair and I honestly have difficulty imagining that many of the ladies would enjoy this and it is most definitely not a family film.Oh, one final word: some people might find the ending very frustrating, if you do, make sure you stay all the way until the end of the credits.

Some of the atmosphere is great and there are some beautiful shots, especially at the start, but all in all I just can't get past the fact that the wolves are stupid. If the plot was that there remained some prehistoric, game-of-thrones era direwolves (or whatever) surviving in the nordic/canadian (whatever) wastes or something maybe, but we are to believe that these are just your regular, murderous, humongous, wolf-seal-team bent on the annihilation of Neeson and his crew.

I love survival movies where it's man versus wild but, in this case, poor plot line and lack of depth wrecked it for me.The characters' decisions throughout the course of the movie were utterly ridiculous, the CGI was terrible, and the depiction of wolves as relentless man-killers is completely unrealistic.I'm disappointed to see another potential hit wrecked by poor choices.",The Grey

Really bothers me that wolves are depicted like ruthless human killers that murder peope for the heck of it. This is really more a corny terror flick than a thriller. In reality, Wolves never approach humans, if you don't believe me do your own research on the net. The film therefore is too detrimental for the efforts undertaken to save gray wolves in North America where unfortunately hunting is a huge sport and where they have been reintroduced in low numbers. It is an irresponsible stance on behalf of the producers and directors to distribute movies that undermine honorable and difficult-to-achieve causes. Besides, the movie really sucks. It's slow, boring, wolves are just computer generated images and has a terrible, unexpected, uncreative ending which leaves you saying ""you gotta be kiddin'"".",The Grey

I say incredible because this movie is utterly bullshitt when putt in reality. The environment, the wolves the cold are purely fantasy at work. The people where the only one i saw as real and could connect with. And Liam does a splendid job.When looked at in its most fundamental form, ""The Grey"" could be considered just another bad Hollywood film in which a group of imperiled people die one at a time. But the movie slows down and puts a focus on the dying last thougths, fleeting memories over loved ones, what they had. It's kinda like the setting turns to ; ""it's okay if i die- i welcome the warmth of the loved ones i have\had, butt i be damned if i'm not gone fight to experiense it another day""That was perhaps the only thing i liked in the whole movie.Conclusion if you know nothing about nature(weather, cold, wolves) or could get past the utterly wrongs done to facts abouht this in the movie,- you might enjoy some of it.",The Grey
466,Sam_Jr,Simple story encased in a very enthralling survival of the fittest adventure!,7,4 April 2012,"Very powerful movie with Neeson using his screen presence to great effect. The storyline is quite basic considering it's produced by Ridley and Tony Scott. Neeson plays a man destroyed by the loss of his love and longs for death to be with her. Joining a group of roughnecks on a plane it crashes leaving the survivors at the mercy of a pack of wolves who stalk their every movement picking them off one at a time.Their is a very powerful scene with a dying passenger who Neeson comforts with both harsh truths about his impending demise and then tender words to ease his passing. The rough and ready oil workers who previously had been bickering and fighting also show a softer side, human silent camaraderie at the witnessing of this passenger's life ebbing away. A few jumping in your seat moments especially if your watching in a cinema or with surround sound occur which only enhance the intensity as you wait for the next wolf attack. This undertone is a common entity in all Ridley Scott's movies and is used cleverly in The Grey. I won't spoil the end but it's a very enjoyable movie gilded by Liam Neeson's on screen presence.",The Grey

468,holburns,The theme of reality is what makes this film great!,8,11 February 2012,"I have read so many disappointed reviews based on this movie and I can't understand why. When you have a film surrounding the theme of reality, the audience gets disappointed because 'this should have happened' and 'that should have happened'. People are forgetting that this film is about survival and therefore is not an action movie filled with effects to 'wow'. This movie captures the feeling of fear incredibly well. From the beginning, you feel the chill in the atmosphere. Liam Neeson was very well cast for this movie. The other characters carry a very intense level of fear but Neeson has this great strength of character, leading this movie into more exciting scenes and really keeps the audience engaged. Throughout the movie, there is an 'on-edge' element 100% of the time, due to the direction and lighting - almost as if the audience can feel the fear of the characters themselves. It makes you want to look around in the scene, see if anything is there. The direction almost gives the feeling of constantly being watched which is great! The best thing about this movie is you feel something is going to happen and it doesn't - it surprises you when you least expect it and it's done very well! These little hints of adrenalin and excitement pop up in the movie at just the right times and leaves you thinking how this movie is going to conclude, which on that note - did not disappoint. The acting is debatable. Some may say the language is excessive and not played as strongly as it could have been. However, I disagree. The tone and use of language is what is appropriate for the storyline and situation the characters find themselves in. You have to look at a movie like this as not being scripted. Survival and reality doesn't come scripted. Does it? That's what captures the atmosphere perfectly. The direction is very well done and is filmed as if placing us as an additional character. Let's face it, a film with Liam Neeson is never one that disappoints.",The Grey
469,wwilliams-307-76490,This is the dumbest wildlife movie ever,4,2 March 2012,"As I guy who has spent a lot of time in Canada's wilderness these past 40 years, most of it in wolf country, the wolf behaviour depicted in this movie is ridiculous. It begins with a scene in which a lone timber wolf charges three grown men standing near a truck. No wolf would ever behave like this. Despite all the time I've spent in areas with large wolf populations (with lots of tracks around), I've only ever caught fleeting glimpses of three or four of them,and that's when I was by myself, unarmed and completely vulnerable.The idea that a pack of wolves would attempt to prey on a group of men is also ridiculous. There has been only one documented predatory wolf attack in North America in the past 200 years, and that involved a large pack and a solitary hiker in Saskatchewan a few years ago.As any wolf biologist would tell you, you can walk up to a pack of wolves feeding on a fresh kill, completely unarmed, and the wolves will scatter. They'd stay and fight a grizzly, but one whiff/sight of human and they'd quickly turn and run.The size of the wolves in this movie is another misrepresentation. The biggest timber wolf on record, when they emptied 20 pounds of meat from his stomach, was a male weighing 120 pounds. The average male is around 90 pounds. A lone wolf would be a very poor match for a 200 pound man armed with a knife.The plot revolved around the wolf's protection of their den. Stupid. Wolves only den when the alpha female gives birth in the spring. And they sure wouldn't be driving the men toward the den in that situation - quite the opposite. Nor do they scatter the bones of all their kills around the den - that would only draw other predators, like grizzlies. Instead, the adults eat at site of the kill and regurgitate the meat for the pups when they get back to the den.Finally, our so-called wolf expert devised all sorts of idiotic defences against the wolves, but ignored the one thing any group of true woodsmen would do in a similar situation (i.e. facing wolves on crack). That's use their knives to make spears. A group of men with spears would be impregnable to a pack of wolves, no matter how large, as no predator likes to risk injury.Dumb, dumb, dumb. If you're going to spend millions on a movie, wouldn't it make sense to spend $10 on a good wolf book first?",The Grey

That's one good thing about this movie, real villains.It is a survival movie, man's effort to stay alive in an extreme circumstances. But then, it's about the endless number of wolves. One, two, three...I felt sleepy counting.It's like watching a certain feature on Animal planet, except you know that the victims are not real, they are actors. The plot is overly dramatised.

It's not the action type film a lot of people will expect, it is more a drama with some thriller elements and some action mixed in. He's a purposeless hunter who works for a large oil company, killing wolves that could otherwise harm the oil pipeline workers (and delay the oil company's production). When the plane he's on goes down in the woods and snow, he has to try to lead the survivors on a quest to safety through wolf territory, which is much more difficult than it seems. A very good film with a great performance by Neeson, and a good supporting turn by Dermot Mulroney as well.",The Grey
472,andr87,"A typical ""survival"" formula applied to a non-horror movie",6,15 May 2012,"""The Grey"" is one of those movies I started watching with high expectations (Neeson starring in it consisting a factor for many, I guess) that turned into mixed feelings by the end.The setting is promising: a bunch of dark folks with dramatic pasts (mostly ex-cons) working hard just to live through the day on a no man's land. Their everyday life takes a turning point when they embark on a plane ride leading to a crash in the middle of the freezing Alaskan lands.This is where one can really start to get frustrated by some disturbing unrealistic events, plot holes that build the whole storyline. First of all, it's amazing how minor the injuries of the survivors are, considering the severity of the crash – not to mention that Liam's character finds himself thrown far away from the plane, even though he was the only one who double tied himself with the seat-belts.Well, it's useless to bring up the big list of factual errors, while you need a major tolerability to digest the premise of the survival conditions – the hyperbolic depiction of the wolves. Oh, yeah. The whole area is packed with diabolical monsters (the CGI is awful in some scenes – poor facial expressions and movements) portrayed as revengeful and invincible in front of a group of humans in possession of unconventional weapons, fire and shelter (at first), who could easily win the battle with the beasts in normal conditions. But this wolves own some tactical skills that would amaze a SWAT team, they don't joke around.No doubt, many aspects of reality can be neglected if you go along with this premise. So, at this point you either stop watching or take the whole scenery as a mythical, symbolic adventure, no matter how predictable it may be. It's obvious, everything leads to a typical horror movie formula, where the characters die one after another. It's just a matter of how they kick the bucket. So where's the plus in this movie? Well, we need to seek for it at the portrayal of characters. This guys' fate was dominated by melancholia, depression (Ottway even tried to commit suicide right before the plane ride), every one of them experienced loss in a way or another, had minimal or zero faith, optimism. So this second chance for life they surprisingly got would be a good reason for a fresh start and hope, change of thoughts. But that's not really the case with them. So if they don't care about their lives, why should we? Nevertheless, it appears until a certain point, everyone subscribes to some valuable idea: living the moment, fighting the fight and if it can't be avoided, embrace death with dignity. Sadly, some of them are overwhelmed by it, so they vanish either because of weakness, illness, bad luck or a sequence of poor judgments and decisions. Speaking of the last, sometime you get the feeling that the script was written by a 10 year old who loves adventure, but has a lack of understanding details and how things work in the big world.Only one guy manages to remain intact until the final stage of this journey, where he engages in the last good fight he'll ever know The ending, I think, saved the whole movie, by taking it to a certain level of drama, emotion, just enough to make you feel content with the development of the story. All in all, ""The Grey"" is an OK movie, but it could have been much better with the right amount of effort from the writers.",The Grey

Even some of my favorites but this movie is absolutely flawless. It's surreal. Although it's a movie you stop looking at them as actors but as guys who are really fighting for their lives. I also love that the ""monsters"" are not some fake werewolf, beast monster but just regular wolves who act like regular wolves. I think sometimes Hollywood wants to take the animalistic nature of animals and pump with steroids. That's when you end up with 50 foot crocodiles and 50 foot anacondas. I love a movie with real everyday natural animals. Makes it waaaay more scarier because the situation in this movie is one that can happen to any of us. I'm willing to bet I won't be getting attacked by a 50 sea creature anytime soon. I also like that the main character wasn't some swole non realistic tough guy who has no emotions. The main character was a regular guy who was scared and trying to survive. I can relate to that. Not Jason Statham beating up Zombie Wolves(Sounds like a movie he'd do).

Who were these crudely carved dolls of the characters? A bunch of witless jackasses who had had no lives anyway. The wolves had more interesting personalities than those ignorami.

On furlough, their plane goes down in the heart of wolf country and the survivors soon realize that the plane crash may have been the more humane death, after wolves start to pick off the men one by one.The movie is paced well, but the emotion among comrades is forced and the writers should really have done a little more research into wolf behavior, survivalist strategies and what kind of bullets a rifle uses.",The Grey
486,cihatdamar,Nice Movie Wrong Audience,9,18 April 2015,"After I watched the movie I wondered its IMDb's score. Rating for this movie made me surprised. For me it should get at least 8.point. Of course it has flaws but I think this movie has everything audience looking for. Firstly if a person chose this movie to watch he/she is probably looking for kind of movies in which man is against nature. And that should satisfy ""man vs nature movie lover"". Even though movie is bit boring at the beginning after the crash you get what you want; fear, a group of people trapped in the middle of nowhere, harsh nature conditions, survival etc. That part is the straightforward lovers. On the whole picture there is some philosophical idea; Life is nothing. You born and you die. That's it. You probably wonder why they kept showing Ottways lovers dying on the bed throughout the movie. And you also should notice that she was not fighting back, she just accepted the situation. And following the crash survivors found a heavy wounded man. Instead of trying to stop his bleeding they tell him he is going to die. That is not kind of scene we are used to see. Probably most of the viewers was surprised at their behavior. They just let him die. And another thing that supports my idea is that although the last 3 person survived through extremely harsh conditions they died easily at the end. The whole idea of survival is collapsed. Everything they did to survive was in vain. One guy was killed just because he wanted to pee, one was killed just because he has acrophobia, one was killed just because he was tired of walking, and the most tragic one was Henrick, he died because his leg was stuck between stones. I think everyone who voted low should watch it again in that view.",The Grey

The camera work is conducted in a way that when an actor is falling through trees or squirming in a river, the camera will be first person view. Ultimately the movie is about life and death, especially about death, Liam really makes you feel his plight and those around him. Mans struggle with self and nature. Very gritty, down to earth sort of action film. Liam perfectly plays a troubled soul which is as unforgiving as the environment around him. Cons: Some of the scenes are a bit far-fetched. With out giving away too much, it is sometimes predictable, in the sense that you know the protagonist will show up at at the right moment to exploit the situation.Watch it! and you wont regret it.

I must say that watching this movie was a painful experience. Now the film has multiple impossibly stupid flaws: wolves that go over huge cliffs, rivers and into the middle of nowhere to attack a bunch of people who survived a plane crash; a guy that swims around in freezing water and comes out of it like it was nothing; loads of people getting out of a plane crash completely unharmed and so on. But honestly I could live with all of that if the movie made up for it with at least anything. I found all of the characters either dull or totally hateable (the funny overly-talkative guy was kinda likable, but he died at the very start). The character Liam Neeson was disgusting, with his no emotions, depressive comments, super-high morality that didn't seem relatively real.

It was lighter on the action than I was expecting and the plot at times veered into the ridiculous (I really don't know that wolves actually act that way, killing and stalking humans just for the hell of it...) but at the same time I guess the wolves are just a metaphor anyway... Two most powerful scenes for me were when Neeson comforts the dying man in the plane, and when Henrik drowns and Neeson has a breakdown. Liam Neeson is great. The man is a star.

491,csulpw,Liam Neeson Survives in the Wilderness,7,28 January 2012,"The Grey is a stellar example of what a survival movie should be. The characters, a group of ex-cons and ruffians, are all likable in their journey to a job on the edge of earth which turns into a fight for survival. The plane sequence is suspenseful to say the least, and the atmosphere really drew me into the world. I felt cold, scared and hopeless just as the characters did in their struggles to fend of the freezing elements and a ruthless pack of wolves.Liam Neeson does another fine job here as John, an outsider that gets thrown into the fray with a bunch of roughnecks. As the security for oil operations in desolate places, he's tasked with fending off wild animals that come near the sites. His knowledge of wolf behavior and his instincts are what lead him and the rest of the survivors towards safety, but the nature of the situation (temperature, predators, and scale) has the final say in the matter.The Grey excels in several places. I liked that there was character conflict, but it was due to fear and shock rather than plain arrogance and bad-guy typecasting. Characters that seemed unlikeable were redeemed, and these rough scoundrels banished at the ends of the earth were shown to be real people with something to fight for.There is also an existential theme in The Grey that challenges people's system of beliefs. John doesn't get a miracle or divine intervention. He has himself and his small amount of resources. People that journey into the wilderness and have the tides turned on them often do not get out alive. Mother nature and starvation are easy to succumb to when our small existence faces a large empty void. Christopher McCandless didn't die because he was a bad person and a sinner. He was an educated, warm person who wandered out into Alaskan wilderness without enough knowledge or resources. It's easy to see how fragile we are when our societal securities are taken away.The ending was my favorite part of the movie. I'm sure many people expected the outcome, and this was my first thought towards the beginning when John gave the men their chances, but it surprised me nonetheless. I didn't expect John to end up where he did, and when you factor in the chances of it happening, it makes it that much more ironic.The Grey fails mostly in the portrayal of the wolves, but since they are shown more to be a force confined to the shadows and in the back of everyone's mind, it wasn't such a problem to me that they weren't very convincing.This is a great survival movie that fans of the genre shouldn't miss.",The Grey

Granted, the characters are oil industry workers on an isolated site, but must every third word or so be the f-word? Boring, boring, boring. I almost expected that by the end of the movie all the dialog would have been taken over by the f-word, conveying meaning solely with a variety of pronunciations and intonations for the same word. Would it be too much to ask to use some random profanity in the beginning and then leave it to the imagination for the rest of the movie? Oil patch workers use rough language. We get it. We get it.

""Once more into the fray!"" So quotes Liam Neeson, as he remembers his father""s favorite poem. It comes in handy as he finds himself leading a pack of men against a pack of wolves in this bleak survival drama. The always likable Neeson once again proves himself so in The Grey. Directed by Joe Carnahan based on his co-written script, we are along for one dark and cold ride. Neeson shines as an oil driller whose job with the company is to keep those pesky wolves from the other workers with his high powered rifle. But he's haunted as he tries to compose a letter to his wife, from whom he's been separated. As depressing as that is, it's compounded by the fact that he's among ""men unfit for mankind"", hard bitten roughnecks boarding a plane for some god-awful frozen zone. The plane goes down with frightening realism, leaving only Neeson and 6 other survivors. Now it's a battle to the death against Mother Nature. And by golly, death we shall have!The survivors try to gather themselves when they realize that they are surrounded by a pack of wolves. Damned if these wolves aren't as determined as hell to kill these boys across miles of terrain. If only Carnahan and his fellow writers were as determined to give us more than an endurance test. C'mon man, if only the lobos knew how little a threat these guys were, they would've gone to the warmth of ""Grandma's"" house to await the hottie in red. It begins to feel like a disaster movie where you play ""Who dies next?"" Neeson's experience with Canis Lupus seems to come in handy, or does it? Seems to me when you are being swarmed by blazingly fast carnivores , in eight inch snow, there is something better to do than ""run!"" which Neeson bellows to his hapless companions. The Wolves vs. the Roughnecks begins to feel like a blowout Superbowl: after a while, it's just not a challenge anymore, it becomes pathetic.The parallels of the behavior of a pack of men vis a vis a pack of wolves is interestingly contemplated, but only for a moment. No sooner does the Alpha Male of the Wolf pack put down a challenge, than Neeson finds himself putting his boot to an upstart's rear. In their journey back towards civilization, some interesting conversations occur, as the men discuss the nature of death, the afterlife, and spirituality. Albeit briefly, these thoughts effectively puts us in the same frame of mind as we contemplate the life and death struggle of these men. Receiving no answer when Neeson bellows skyward to help from God, Neeson says ""F--- it. I'll do it myself!""Liam Neeson one again earns his well deserved pay check by elevating what could have amounted to a wilderness slasher film into something a little deeper. Likability surely is a strong commodity, and if Neeson could bottle it, he'd make a whole lot more than this film probably will. He is perfectly cast. The rest of the actors do a good job, but they are hampered by the dour script, although several scenes are quite arresting in their starkness and realism.Though the performances, and photography are well done, you'll be doubly glad that winter is almost over after watching this depressing tale. Unfortunately, the characters and the interesting ideas regarding death and survival are not as developed as they should have been. There is not much redemption here, just what amounts to ultimately pointless and ironic suffering. Are we supposed to be shocked that these men fight to survive? There has to be more than just the fight, (what are they fighting for?) but we don't have that here. The film ultimately leaves one exhausted and unenlightened. When Neeson quotes his father's poem with ""Live and Die this Day"", it feels more like the latter.",The Grey

The film could even continue if you subtract wolves from the equation and just left nature, climate, the cold, lack of food, sickness. You would also have to ignore the lack of reality of the film and imagine it as a fantasy, but isn't the whole point of this film the rawness, the survival in the wild, life and death?

He portrayed a suicidal person (still nobody knows why) who was supposed to be this big expert on wolves and wild life, but immediately lead a group of a plane crash survivors to certain death. His first order in command: Leave the plane where they had some kind of shelter and go straight to the wolves den! By doing so, everybody except him died. The whole wolves thing was unrealistic, both in their appearance and behavior, not even making sense. The worst scene for me was after a guy was killed by the wolves while they were leaving the crash site. The rest of the team just spent the night exchanging jokes and past stories just like they were in a beach around fire. That was ridiculous to say the least. The writers failed miserably to create a background for the main characters as their life stories were ordinary and boring.

The few survivors are constantly followed by wolves as they trek across the snow desert environment. Each survivor is killed from time to time because of each of their phobias, weaknesses, or plain old stupidity. The only man who seems to be smart is the main character who is acted by Liam. It turns out that in the movie, the character is constantly dreaming or reminded about his wife. You only find out near the end of the movie that she recently died. In a purely coincidental truth, Liam's real life wife had also died just before the filming of The Grey due to a skiing accident. In the end of the movie, Liam is about ready to give up when the pack of wolves surround him. The alpha male challenges Liam's character, he wraps his hands in tape and attaches broken glass bottles.

500,gstan,Totally unrealistic,2,3 February 2012,"Okay, I realize Hollywood is Hollywood and it is normal for them to bend reality a little for the sake of their art. And I can suspend belief for a few hours when necessary ... after all a science fiction movie is fiction and a fairy tale is just that. But this film didn't ""bend"" reality so much as break it, throw it in the mud, then trample all over it and toss it in the trash.I could fill at least one tightly spaced page with all the things that defy reason in this film but I'll try to limit myself to just a few. I have been to Alaska in the winter. I know people that have worked the oil fields. I know that in Alaska or Northern Canada you don't wander around in near white-out conditions, with the temps below zero, without COMPLETELY covering EVERY part of your body. You don't tramp around with your ears, nose, chin, etc. unprotected, and your coat only partially zipped up, as the survivors did when they left the plane.The Neeson character is shown at the beginning of the film using a high-power rifle, which he carries in a distinctive case. After the plane crash he finds his rifle case and his broken rifle, but he also finds shot gun shells in the case. ???? He didn't even have a shot gun; why would he carry shot gun shells? We later find that they are a contrivance -- tossed in only to foist an completely unrealistic plot element on us. (I guarantee that using those shells the way the movie tried to would result in MAYBE 1 in 100 of them firing. I can explain why if you can't figure it out yourself) Again, the weather. After spending a night in a blizzard ... a night in which their fire goes out (at least there is no fire in the morning scene), at least two of the characters are shown waking up bare-headed, their coats partially unfastened and no sign of blankets but, miraculously, they are bright-eyed,almost chipper and ready to go after their hours long ordeal in sub-zero weather.The wolves. What can you say about the wolves except that real wolves act NOTHING like those depicted in this movie. No real, wild wolf would go anywhere near fire the way these mutts do. Real wolves don't hunt humans over miles and miles of territory like the movies unless MAYBE ... PERHAPS ... they are near starved and ready to eat anything. Real wolves don't normally kill unless it's for food. And how did those wolves get down that massive cliff anyway? And how did they know in advance where the humans were going? They must have known since they were there waiting for them. If you want to know what real wolves act like, read Farley Mowat.I didn't have time to try and enjoy this movie as art because every few moments My reason was assaulted with totally contrived, totally unrealistic plot elements. I kept finding myself shaking my head and telling myself, ""That's not remotely close to reality."" As I said, I could fill many lines with similar discrepancies. I wouldn't be so critical if this movie was marketed as a survival FANTASY, but it's not.

It has a very bleak tone which shows just what these characters are going through. It's not just about surviving, it's about finding a reason to. The script sells this very well, with even the most unlikable characters having depth to them. And even when the characters do something stupid, at least it's understandable. They're desperate, scared, and alone. They'll try anything to stay alive. Neeson steals the spotlight (big surprise) but the supporting actors are still very good in their own right.

It may look cold and desolate, sure, but this is still a great film to look at.I don't understand why so many people on this site are running this film through the gutter because it didn't meet their expectations of realism.

512,celluloidjunky,Forget the wolves look at the small touches,7,4 June 2012,"The Grey is a beautifully shot film set within the Alaskan wilderness. It is an understated story with two basic threads that are handled expertly to elevate it above the normal survival horror affair. Granted, many will tell you that wolf behaviour, as depicted here, borders on the ridiculous, but this is not something I major in. Stephen Spielberg's Jaws didn't exactly mirror true shark behaviour, but nevertheless is still one of my favourite films. If you want to know how surreal the wolf behaviour is you can read about it here http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1601913/ Most of the negative reviews either focus on this or discuss just how hostile the Alaskan wilderness is, and the probability of survival against the elements being far more of a match for our plane crash survivors. If The Grey was to be rated on realism it would score very poorly indeed. The sad truth is that most of what is improbable, or downright silly, adds very little to this film. For me it could easily have had a more realistic heart. What elevates this film are the small touches, which are handled with such delicate care that you wonder whether all the wolf-violence was thrown in just to sell tickets.There is something poetically simple about The Grey. Both the story, the soft, repeating soundtrack and the pale landscapes of white, grey and green unravel an episodic tale with very few surprises. At the heart of the story is a poem written by the father of Liam Neeson's (Ottway) character. The importance of this poem is well-handled by writer/director Joe Carnahan and it adds a back-beat to the soul of this film.Once more in the fray Into the last good fight I'll ever know Live and die on this day Live and die on this dayThe poem could be written about anything. Whether it's about Ottway's dying wife, his father's distant memory or the final battle against the wolf pack matters not. The relevance of this poem is stamped over every frame of film, from the opening moments where Ottway contemplates suicide, to the death of a lone wolf or the drip connected to his wife. As the Alaskan wilderness blows blizzard after blizzard, it may as well be haunting the survivors, whispering the four lines over and over again as they try and outwit a marauding pack of wolves.The simplicity of the poem and the central theme of loss are used to great effect in The Grey. Carnahan uses very simple tools to remind us of what once was, whether it's through handling wallets belonging to the dead or flashbacks to Ottway's dying wife. It's this revelation, that the suicidal Ottway has been trying to come to terms with his own personal grief since the very beginning, that works tremendously well in tandem with the poem. At the start of the film, Ottway is about to end his life but stops because it isn't the last good fight he'll ever know. That will come later.The Grey is a predictable film but well-executed with some standout performances, particularly from Neesam. The best scene is far removed from the violent maulings that beset our plane crash survivors. Instead it's about plain old exhaustion. Diaz, played by the excellent Frank Grillo, eventually stops walking. He talks about his failings in life and why he has no fight in him to carry on. He's lonely and even if he survives there's nothing for him. Instead he sits down forever and lets nature take him with the great, beautiful wilderness as his witness. It is a poignant moment, and one that will linger in the memory, like Ottway's lost wife and his father's poem.",The Grey

All the characters in the movie have there stories and throughout the whole film they all come together to fight for one thing trying to survive.

515,aka_4200,Not up to expectations but still good,7,1 February 2012,"First off, I would like to reiterate a little bit of what other people are saying, this movie is nothing like the typical Friday night flick. When most people think of a Liam Neeson movie, they think of a B.A. action packed movie where Neeson is almost emotionless. This movie however showed a completely different side to Neeson's typical character and in fact opened him up to a new genre of actors. Yes, in this movie there is a lot of swearing, (over 150 F words used) but please be realistic when you judge that, because in a real survival situation with drillers, you are not going to be watching your mouth. I felt everything in the movie was not out of the ordinary, but in fact easily relatable to anyone who has been lost in the wilderness for more than a few hours. Another key factor that added to the movie was that the characters truly played their roles well. Each character started off as a callous strong-headed jerk, but as the movie progresses, they finally start to break down and realize the situation. This movie I believe was a true thriller, but no way whatsoever a positive movie, it is filled with constant death, mutilation, and vulgar scenes most parents would not want their kids seeing, so the age limit is probably 16+ minimum. Now onto the reasons I didn't like the movie. Well first off, we all know this movie is about some survivors being hunted by wolves, but I just felt as if the movie was dragged on a little longer than it should have been which in turn can make it a little redundant. I mean anyone who has seen a horror movie would be able to predict which character was going to die at each point. I felt as if some of the death scenes were as unoriginal as a, ""Your mom joke"" but keep in mind I say some not all. The second reason that prevents a higher score for this movie is the fact that although you did learn a little bit about the people, you never really had a connection with any of them. There was no single person that you could truly describe with confidence, and made it so they were all mysterious. Even Neeson, the main character, you never find out what happened to his wife, or why in the beginning he was depressed. Now finally, contrary to the vague descriptions on the people, there was also a question on the story line. For example, what was it that caused the airplane to go down? This was what annoyed me the most. You see Neeson sleeping at one moment and then the next the plane is in half and hurling towards the ground. I feel that we should have been shown exactly what happened and why they plane is just disassembling in mid air. However, I am not saying this is a bad movie, I personally felt the movie was above average, but not what I expected. This can be interpreted as a good thing, but I like to keep a neutral tone. Many say that the ending is very frustrating to most, but if you can figure things out then you should have no problem at all with the ending. I personally would recommend seeing it, but it is not a movie you will want to watch again I would assume.",The Grey

Any fire they built was tiny, no thought was given to making a defensive structure.Seriously, do they think the watching public are so dumb?1/10 for this awful movie - the only reason it gets one point is for the acting of the Wolves - they were excellent.",The Grey
517,drstockk,Agree with most critical viewers...,6,16 June 2012,"First off, let me start by saying that I absolutely love Liam Neeson. I believe that he is a wonderful and brilliant actor. In fact, I think the overall acting by all of the actors in this movie was stellar. Unfortunately, it is so difficult to overcome the premise of the movie. I mean, really, we know that wolves can/are dangerous and extraordinarily intelligent creatures, but it is so unrealistic to believe they would malicious stalk these men in such a calculated and fearless manner. The movie would have been much more believable if the producers used a more realistic plot. They should have elected to cast bears over wolves. The demise of actors outside of the wolf savaging was much more plausible; one character drowning, one falling from the trees, etc. ""The Grey"" certainly had tons of potential, but fell woefully short. I wanted to love this movie, primarily because of the cast and superb acting, but I, like most of my fellow posters, could not shirk the fiction of this storyline.Liam, still love you man, and will continue to watch your movies!",The Grey
518,colbyreeveshahaha,Awesome!,10,29 January 2012,"I loved loved loved this movie. I hope the rumors are true about it coming back in October because I think Liam Neeson deserves a best actor nod and I would love to see the director and writers even get some love too because I thought they did a fantastic job. Even Dermot Mulroney and that guy from Walk the Line were really good. Why stop there...Frank Grillo was awesome too! I was excited to see this just based on the trailers but when I read about some of the supporting cast, I was even more ecstatic about it. Lots and lots of jump moments combined with what was a perfect human drama really make for an incredible movie going experience.",The Grey
519,jimmyreardonjimmy,Great Until the End,4,27 January 2012,This movie was a great psychological thriller. It had you thinking the whole time. Who was going to get picked off by the wolves next. I highly enjoyed it.There was only one issue. I personally don't think that they ended the movie well. For anyone who doesn't want a spoiler stop reading now. They end the movie hanging with Liam Niesson preparing to fight a wolf. You have no idea what happens.Need I say more. Suck ending for a good movie.Rating 4/10 Tons of Cursing the F word was probably used around 80 times so the language is not suitable for children. There are many sexual innuendos's that children wouldn't pick up but adults would and they are very vulgar.,The Grey
520,SorceressDamia,Depressing!!,1,27 January 2012,"This was the most depressing movie I have seen since A.I.: Artificial Intelligence. The beginning, the middle and the end were all depressing. There was no comic relief. Not one single episode of goodness to hold on to. Absolutely nothing good occurred to help you get through the fear, terror, blood and defeat.I was flabbergasted and stunned at how awful this movie was. To my relief, other people in the cinema seemed to feel the same way. One younger women in the audience shouted out, ""Did anyone here like this movie?"" No one responded.The only thing that could have made this movie better is if I could somehow have received a refund.",The Grey

The Grey is one of the most beautiful, depressing, exhilarating, and powerful films I have ever seen. Do yourself a favor and go see this film in theaters and not on TV. The sound of the wilderness and wolves needs to be heard in the theaters. The acting in this movie is so real and astonishing. I give it an A+. It's as though if the film was actually real and it was somehow caught on camera. On top of that, the cinematography is astounding. This is one of those films that will get better with age. Furthermore I believe this will make many all-time best films list. This film is a 10. Go see it!",The Grey
522,bevanel,"Good movie, strange ending",7,29 February 2012,"The movie itself is okay. The ending is a bit bizarre, for me. I will not spoil it for you so that's all I'll say about it. All scenes with the wolves are well made, although they do look a bit like puppets. The scenes in the air plane and in the water is made very well. All actors make it a nice movie to watch with lots of tension and back-flashes. These back-flashes are important to understand the ending of this movie. The way most flashbacks are interrupted are also very odd, but keep you in the movie. It sometimes takes to long before things happen, you just know that when they're walking through the snow 'The Grey' will appear. The movie keeps it interesting so you never know how long it takes for them to appear. Still it was an okay movie, I understand the ending but it's not what I expected. I think you will not expect it either!!",The Grey
523,Ricostar19,Man v.s Wild !,9,7 February 2012,"After watching such a simple yet captivating commercial for The Grey, I finally saw this truly epic film. After a very vague scene, Ottwell and crew members endure one of the most intense plane crashes I have ever seen. With loud noises and quick flashes of his wife, this scene is very intense. I jumped out of my seat and felt the chills slither down my spine. This movie was a supreme example of Man v.s Nature; bringing man down to his very knees and fighting. The wolves, below freezing temperatures, raging waters and massive forests take these men away from their natural mindset. And throws them into a world where man must fight, survive and push their limits; so far that they will do things they would have never imagined. Danger lurking around every corner, and new and unexpected obstacles make this journey of survival an almost impossible task. Ottwell, the most daring and useful crew member is faced with a never easy task; becoming the leader and guiding six other men. While dealing with the ever increasing chance of death, he remains strong while watching the numbers drop. With his late father's poem and his late wife's inspiration, Ottwell pushes hard against nature. And with MacGyver like skills, Ottwell manages to protect his men farther than the average human being. This movie is legendary, in the fact that I have never seen a film more realistic and nature so wildly dangerous. Liam Neeson adds another role onto his list of great action roles.",The Grey
524,kaitlincg95,"Unrealistic, Pointless and Dismal",2,26 May 2012,"After hearing that The Grey was a great movie, I was utterly disappointed, if not frustrated, by the time I finished watching.I won't go into this too far because many reviews have already mentioned it, but the way the wolves acted was ridiculous. Completely unrealistic. The first thing that really bothered me though was the fact that all of the survivors left the plane crash. Couldn't they have made a shelter out of the wreckage? Of course they could have. Second thing that bothered me was Liam Neeson's character. Liam's character was suicidal at the beginning of the movie. If he'd been in a plane crash, I really don't think he would have tried so hard to survive. I mean what would the point have been? He had no family (as far as we could see) and he already wanted to die.Other things that bothered me include: flat characters, inaccurate situations (um, hello, Liam Neeson surviving after 3 minutes in a freezing Alaskan river?), and the over-all bleakness of the movie. What was the point? I don't see one. It's hard to sympathize with Liam's cold, suicidal character; difficult to connect with him and really /want/ him to survive, thus making it almost pointless to watch and see how things turn out. This feeling's really reinforced when the movie ends on such a grim note. No feeling of satisfaction or closure, really. It was one of those moments where seconds before the film ends, you're saying: No, please don't end this way! Please! If it ends like I predict, this will be such a waste of time!I give the film a 2 because at least the camera-work was alright.",The Grey
525,benzir13,Worst Movie in the last year (maybe more years),2,8 February 2012,"I would start from the positive. Excellent playing by Liam Neeson. Great photography and great editing. Some parts are scary as intended. That's the reason I gave it two stars and not one.Now to the plot. That's the most implausible plot I have seen in my recent memory. Starting from their decision to leave the crash site with the lame excuse that nobody will find them there. This is really stupid. They found the plane of JFK Junior in the bottom of the sea within 24 hours of the crash. His airplane had less sophisticated equipment and for sure they had a transponder that was constantly in radio contact especially in a place like Alaska. Then the wolves' behavior. It looks very childish. It looks totally wrong from my low level knowledge of pack animal behavior. I am not going to give readers much more spoilers, but one of the decisions of jumping off a cliff to tie a flimsy rope to a tree is totally ridiculous. There was no point in doing that since they could have continued to walk along it until the cliff is more manageable and then there is the impossibility of a normal human being actually doing that. Maybe I don't get this and this genre is like those impossible mission impossible where the acrobatics is the essence here. Sorry. The IMDb scoring normally correlates with my taste. Not this time.",The Grey

No, it was just very disappointing. The acting was top notch what you would expect from Liam Neeson in the lead role no flaws there, but the storyline was dire it had the potential to be something great but instead it was sloppy,unbelievable in the sense that it was just unrealistic for a movie that tried to be and dragged on for far too long, just when the movie started to get good it ended with a very rushed and unfitting climax. I wouldn't recommend that you go out of your way to see it but if it's on at 9pm on a Wednesday night then give it a go.",The Grey
527,camjohn918,I'll Never Forget It,10,25 February 2012,"Now if you had asked me that if a seemingly generic action movie starring the awesome Liam Neeson released in January, no less, would leave this much of an impact on me... I'd never have believed it. I'd never have thought that The Grey would be the movie that leaves me speechless at the end. In fact, going into this movie I expected it to be an enjoyable thrill that I'd forget about in a few days. In reality this movie's been on my mind for weeks now. I... I'm not entirely sure what to say, really. I'll never get how movie reviewers can do their job, watch a movie and review it the same day and make it sound professional, especially if they really liked the movie. I debated reviewing the movie after I watched it, but I am glad I didn't- I've seen a few movies that I could swear were the best ever until the next day, and I wondered if this would have been the same. Needless to say that after I've spent weeks gushing about this movie to anyone who hears it, created a piece or two of artwork for it, memorized the recurring poem and gotten the song in the last scene for my music library... needless to say I haven't forgotten it. And I still can't quite sit down and go through a technical review of the movie and pinpoint all the good stuff and exactly why it is good. I can just say what happened to me as I watched it.The cinematography made the movie. From the very first scene I could practically feel the cold air around the refinery, with the moonlight and electric lights reflecting on all the metallic towers and surfaces, turning them a dark orange as Liam Neeson's character John Ottway walked through the puddle-laced walkways with his rifle in hand. When the plane crashed, there was such a realistic feel with the snow being sprayed, the almost fuzzy quality of the camera that brought you into the movie like no other movie did before- It made me feel so cold, and I believe I put my jacket back on after a few minutes. There being little to no music (and only at the right times) was a brilliant move as well as it really added to the realistic qualities, turning the movie from a ride to an experience.Liam Neeson is an incredible actor. His performance was simply indescribable. I got chills from many of his scenes, especially at the end. His character was very engaging as well.I very much appreciated how the rest of the actors, also doing a very good job, were relatively unknown, at least to a more pedestrian viewer such as myself. It made their characters much more real, much more engaging, to make up for the fact that they do not have Neeson's extraordinary chops.There were a number of memorable scenes, whether exhilarating, startling (one scene had me nearly decking the man behind me as I leaped up in surprise), contemplative or even heartbreaking.The last scene will be the one that polarizes the movie-going public, but to me it was one of the best scenes I've ever bore witness to. Topped off by a beautiful song called The City Surf (a cleverly re-used movie score song), it reduced me to an emotional wreck that had to wait until the end of the credits to get up.Speaking of which, wait till the end of the credits if you can get over the ending.Most importantly, I should add that you may not necessarily love this movie nearly as much as I do. It, at its essence, is very polarizing. It was also poorly advertised, as it's not a typical action movie- it's barely even an action movie. It's more of a philosophical, art-house film that explores the idea of how we face impossible odds and maybe even death, and leaves you thinking about it at the end. I respect if you want to see a more straightforward action movie, but this is not it for sure. But it's definitely a remarkable one. I'll always remember it. 2012 looks to be a remarkable year for movies. But The Hunger Games, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, Dark Knight Rises, Brave and... really, anything else, they're going to have to work hard to top this in my eyes.Rating: 10/10- for me, at least.",The Grey
528,jet19957,Once more into the fray,10,15 March 2012,"The plot of this one is not over complex, nor is it too simplified. It finds the perfect balance, that halfway point, where you are completely enthralled without having to stop and think about what has just happened. This was shot on location, somewhere in Canada, in 20 or 40 below zero. The sound of the piercing wind, the look of the snow, it's all very authentic looking. Except for the wolves, which I admit are painfully fake at times. But this is easily overlooked. They are large and ferocious creatures, and when they attack, boy do they attack. What really surprised me about this film was its heart, its sense of humanity. This is much deeper than Taken and Unknown, the characters are very authentic and real. They give you something you can feel, people you can relate to and pity. The story of Ottaway's father, and that poem. The back story with his wife. There comes a point where he admits, ""I'm scared. We all are. If you're not, you're a fool."" They ask questions, talk of god, wonder why we are here, talk of their daughters, stories, the way real men do. The way this challenges the classic Hollywood fearless leader, emotionless character,is spectacular. The score is powerful and mystifying. Perfect for this movie. I saw this in January, opening weekend. I've seen a lot of movies since then probably 15+, but this one still manages to stick with me the longest. The emotional journey you take through a sick frozen, gruesome Hell with these men is one that will leaved you gazed. I'm not saying this is entirely realistic, there are parts where some will question something, but that's not what matters. The men do. The character. I do hope this gets nominated for something, all performances were amazing, the score was great. And the theme is excellent, that life is worth fighting for. Once more into the fray. Into the last good fight I'll ever know. Live and die on this day. Live and die on this day.",The Grey
529,vassago26_98,Moments of Clarity through Despair,8,26 March 2012,"I was not sure about this film going in, as I heard and read many varying reviews. I am glad I watched it and I will have to add this to my list of favorites. If you are looking for a surface film made only for 90 minutes of pure mindless entertainment, then this will probably not make you satisfied. If instead, you are looking for a depth of character and story, and an exploration of the feelings of hope when all is hopeless, then you will find this film to be quite awesome. This is a classic tale of emptiness and internal struggle. The film looks at a band of outcasts, who are all running or hiding from some moment in their past. Tough men, who despite their rough exterior, have fled into the wilderness to avoid and forget. All have left behind something they miss. Liam Neeson's story is one of loss, and he finds purpose briefly as a leader of men when faced with amazing challenges of nature, beasts, and dangerous egos. This movie is both epic and poetic. It is full and empty. It is dramatic in it's simplicity and view of the male ego. Liam Neeson has in recent years become one of my favorite actors due to the understated toughness he portrays so well. Cheers Mr. Neeson. Thanks for another great film.",The Grey
530,roma-bsv,A well made drama.,9,1 April 2012,"The film is much more than meets the eye. It have an action elements and the survival movie taste, but pretty unrealistic situations and actions. That's exactly the reason of complaining and pretty low rating. Thats exactly, why its so unique..In first place, its a well made drama, a simple story, back-rounded with a plain crash and wolves chaise. And that's whats make the movie very special. It takes long time to realize that, I would say, until the last 15 minutes, but its there! End scene reveals the reasons and actions of Ottway, his thoughts and feelings. The action part could take place anywhere else, be more or even less realistic, but still unimportant.Give this a chance, it's far beyond the score, have a deep meaning and a perfect Neeson acting. 9/10",The Grey
531,dabshee,Overall good but not my kind of movie,6,16 June 2012,"SPOILER ALERT!!!! I gave it a 6 because it was definitely moving and the entire cast was great. I was a nervous wreck from the first bit of turbulence until the end. Dermot Mulroney was almost unrecognizable. I recognized him on the plane but didn't recognize that he survived the crash. I suspect this movie is like Hotel Rwanda - tells a good story but is overall depressing. I bought Hotel Rwanda but never could bring myself to watch it. I realize horrifying things occur in life, but I don't enjoy watching train wrecks. I own the movie Alive so I was curious to see how this would differ. Both were about horrifying, extreme conditions but ""The Grey"" added a twist with the super size wolves. Watching this movie was a huge let down. It seems like a pessimistic atheist wrote it to prove there is no higher power nor any good luck. Despite your best efforts, you fail in the end. Also, it was dumb for them to put bullets on the end of sticks while only using the knives to sharpen one stick a piece. I guess they left the door open for a sequel but since I don't go to movies to cry and feel like crap when it's over, I'll pass.",The Grey
532,bethdixon02,Pretty bad,6,15 July 2012,"OK. First the religious hate seems pretty blatant. They basically talk about an oil company outpost (we all know from Obama how evil those oil companies are :) ), then they say that these people aren't fit to live in society and then directly show a cross to try and tie religion and horrible people together. Sad. More of Hollywood pushing it's views on the general public through entertainment.Next, the wolves are an example of CGI gone wrong. In one situation a wolf's face is shadowed completely incorrectly given the surroundings. Just one example of many where they don't look remotely believable.Next, the wolves just come and go, both in sight and sound, as the director sees fit, not in any way that makes sense. The wolves just make noise for no reason and then they just shut up. Real wolves don't act like this.Next, is the sound which is horrible. In one scene you hear wolves from far away and then you hear what is supposed to be the alpha male and it sounds like it's growling right into the microphone even though it's far away in the movie. Amatures.Next are the gimmicks. This movie is so boring that they try to use gimmicks to scare you back awake. They turn down the sound of the voices so that you can hardly hear them in an effort to try and get you to turn up the TV and then they try and startle you with some guy breathing or with ridiculously loud wind noise. These are the gimmicks Hollywood uses to scare you when they don't possess the skill to create a scary mood. Again, just sad.Then comes the horrible logic. They jump over a cliff and onto a tree to escape the wolves right behind them, but somehow over a huge cliff and at the bottom of a huge tree the wolves somehow were waiting for them. Stupid.Then more gimmicks. There's a song by a composer John Murphy called Surface of the Sun or something like that. You can hear it on Youtube by searching for ""Sunshine/Surface of the Sun"" and finding the video with that exact punctuation. The song is awesome and just oozes depth, the problem is that it's vastly overused. The first time you see it in a movie you'll love it. The second time you'll love it. By the time you've picked it out of 5 or 6 movies, you'll start to see that it's now being used by everyone to make you feel like something profound is happening. It get's old and ""The Grey"" is just the latest movie to sponge off of a great Murphy song.The end of the movie used the song to good effect along with a little poem, but in the end this movie is not good at all. It's just not realistic, interesting, or well done.",The Grey
533,highlanderbobcat,an hour of my life I won't get back,2,24 November 2012,"Phony, phony, phony. Good thing I didn't watch to the end or I'd feel really robbed. I immediately looked up other films by director and ""writer"" Joe Carnahan to see what other pieces of tripe I should avoid in the future.And sooooo disappointing too, I had such high hopes for it. I seem to recall hearing that this film was good, but if I did hear that - my source was very, VERY wrong. Did I mention it was phony? The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the acting was actually quite good. The script was decent as well, but the story line...my gawd...needless to say whoever wrote this should really be left stranded in Alaska. Not only to gain some realistic perspective, but to avoid troubling the rest of us with any more of this rubbish. Phony.Wolves don't attack humans. Ever. Period. There has never been a recorded case of a wolf - in the wild - attacking a human, let alone a group of people. Bears don't attack people in groups of 4 or more, wolves sure as heck don't. And they (like ALL animals) HATE fire, they don't come sauntering up to it. Some of the facts presented in the film are accurate, but this stereotype is yet more reckless and irresponsible film making.They could have used angry caribou or heck, even a bunch of supernatural creatures, and still created the same story of survival. A bunch of yetis is actually more believable than the notion that wolves would attack men.Aside from the wolves, the decision making on the part of the characters was horribly flawed, to the point of deliberate self destruction, the action scenes were phony and poorly shot, and the physics were unrealistic.COULD have been an 8 or 9 star movie, but as is - is not worth watching.",The Grey

Until yesterday, when I heard that the film had a surprise for me after the credits. So I took another look, and now I have a new take on the movie. So, if like me you took off after seeing the credits start rolling, you think the film ends with the alpha wolf closing in on Leam Neeson as he straps a knife and some shards of glass to his hands.

Some of his titles are odd in that they went the mainstream route and somewhat lowest common denominator but has totally redeemed himself, in my opinion, with The Grey.The film is really about death and how we live our lives with it looming over us. When a character perishes, they die somewhat in a manner to how they lived. Think ""No Mas"" (No More) and how he has enough and sits there waiting for his fate. I always think of the line in a Metallica song which is: ""My lifestyle determines my deathstyle"" Visually the film is dark, cold and brooding. Looks amazing. Neeson is broken, then bold and then fierce. The last 5 minutes of the film are to me what The Grey is all about.Not an easy watch by any means but definitely worth it.",The Grey
536,bossysheryl,Liam Neeson is OFF MY LIST,1,6 February 2012,"I went with to this on ""girls night away from the Superbowl crazed boys"" night.I admit up front: I had seen the previews, and had not planned to see this film.Nonetheless, the consensus of the group was that Liam Neeson is a very good actor who makes interesting choices, and we all liked his work. Which is true. Until last night, I had never been disappointed by one of his performances. Until last night, Liam Neeson was one of a half dozen actors whose choice of material I was willing to trust.He's off my list.PROBLEM 1: Plotted misuse of resources. These nutbars are surrounded by sharp plane wreckage, YET use none of it to fashion EITHER shelter from the storm, OR weapons to fight the wolves. Exhausting themselves to 'walk to the tree line"" was just STUPID. They all deserved to die for that alone. (I should have left THEN, and gone to see a different movie.) PROBLEM 2: Excessively poor CGI wolves. I mean, so bad as to cause me to giggle every time they showed a wolf running thru the snow! Did these guys get some kinds of product placement cash for using the software to ""make"" the wolves, as opposed to hiring animal handlers to use real ones? I think real wolves might have helped a LOT.PROBLEM 3: Blowing now substituted for plot. See, the thing is, they didn't HAVE to be struggling with the blowing snow. They could have stayed with the plane, forted up and defended themselves. The blowing snow could have been an interesting thing as an adversary, or could have been used as an ally, using snow to solidify and insulate their forted up space....Instead, the snow just blows around. A lot. I mean, a REALLY lot of blowing. I'll bet 45 minutes of this movie were shots of blowing snow! PROBLEM 3a: Intense staring substituted for dialog. I know, they have no breath to talk because they're stupidly running from wolves thru the woods; but the staring thing does NOT work. It ESPECIALLY doesn't work when the 'stare' is being generated by one of the laughably bad CGI wolves!!!!PROBLEM 4: Generic characterization, compounded by furry hats, making it hard to tell which actors were which; the only reason you could tell Neeson was his accent, plus he was always in the lead. Actual dialog between the characters could have helped this. The only character that talked, they killed 20 minutes in! PROBLEM 5: Consistency of thought processes: e.g., the broken mini-bottles. REALLY? You had mini bottles you could have broken and made SPEARS with, and you wait until NOW, and then strap them between your fingers??? What was that you said about using sticks for distance when you were duct-taping the shotgun shells to sticks earlier? The whole film is just riddled with this kind of 'didn't you just....' It's very annoying; but this film has at least 4 bigger problems than consistency....As I said before: Liam Neeson is OFF my list. I'll never take a chance on another film just because he's in it.",The Grey

If you can ignore some basic survival mistakes in the early stages, this becomes a compelling tragedy.Not good at stretching to 10 lines but that is the requirement of this site ... hmmm. Well the various characters are pretty much a regular mix of the human male that you would find working up in the north. Hiding from civilization for one reason or another and with some endearing and some revolting characteristics. There are no real good guys or bad guys and that is part of the tragedy. I found a lack of ingenuity amongst the characters and little real survival skills. The worst being that they leave a shelter they could defend for open ground and into a forest they know nothing about and of course more disaster. ... but it keeps you watching and hoping they will get some good luck and not just continue with the bad.",The Grey
538,jhoeboer-1,"Interesting, with a few flaws",7,18 December 2015,"So The Grey, featuring Liam Neeson in an excellent role, is an interesting flick. A flick with some issues that require you to suspend disbelief but an interesting one nonetheless.What I liked about the film is how all the characters are likable, even the man who initially behaves like an instigating asshole comes around at the end, showing he's just acting like that to cover up the fact he's just as afraid as everyone else.The minor picks I had with this film were: - Liam Neeson survives the plane crash completely unscathed. Possible but not very likely seeing as to how they went down. - Why did no one use parts of the plane to fashion weapons when they had already been made aware wolves were going to be an issue. The strips of metal that were scattering the area would have made excellent swords/spears useful for self defense. - Wolves even attacking when they're very close to a fire (the Omega wolf attacking). Or wolves showing almost human ability to plan attacks ahead. The 2nd last man drowns in the river because his foot is stuck, so wth did Liam's character not look below the watery surface why he wasn't coming up. Or wth did the guy drowning indeed not hold his breath when he clearly was aware that was he given new air twice. And why did Liam's character not die of hypothermia after haven fallen into a freezingly cold stream prior to this entire scene.So yes the film does require some suspense of disbelief. But the whole vibe (the comradery, the desolate landscape) makes up for this and ends up coming together as a solid film about human survival instincts, testing the limits of human will and maintaining one's humanity under harsh conditions.",The Grey

Summary of the movie:""Hey we just crashed in the middle of nowhere, but this huge metal plane with huge metal parts that could be used to make a barricade and keep us safe in, doesn't sound like a very good idea so let's leave and head to the woods where a huge pack of bloodthirsty wolves is waiting for us, but somehow we'll be safer there.Also don't even bother getting some sharp metal parts of the plane as the ones we used to beat the wolves with in order to save our professional wolf hunter who magically survived after being mauled by two huge wolves. ZERO further need for weapons!We managed to kill a wolf because 12 Gauge shells exploding in open air at about 1 feet from our face, miraculously only kill what's in front of us, and we're good to go.Now we suddenly have a huge fire and we cook him and have a laugh, giving a total of zero damns about our friend who got mauled to death before our eyes a few minutes ago. All of us look in one direction during our happy episode in the forest, and the top predators hunting us in huge numbers don't attack us from behind.Next, we find a way to safely jump off a cliff over 400 meters tall, but when we reach down, the wolves are already waiting for us. They probably discovered a way of telleportation! A guy pretty much breaks his knee but is still able to walk through snow and keep up with two healthy guys for several miles, however he gets bored because he's a drunk loser, so he decides to give up by sitting ON A HUGE LOG NEAR A DAMN RIVER. We don't even consider going downriver on the log.All three of us are being chased by the same wolves, but we decide to stay and have a little fun talk, shake hands, and everything. Finally we get ourselves chased by two wolves, while we're slowly moving through huge snow, but somehow we can outrun them, until we fall in freezing water where one of us drowns and the last one gets back to land, giving a total of ZERO damns about being wet in below freezing temperatures.After magically drying off, he has a small existential crisis, but he shortly decides to keep moving until it reaches a wolf den.(IN WINTER WHEN WOLVES MIGRATE TO FIND FOOD) However despite being occupied with wolf cubs, the den it's unprotected, and our wolf hunter has plenty of time to go through a ton of memories until the wolves show up. The last survivor doesn't get mauled to death instantly by the pack, because the leader of the pack wants to show off in a 1v1, this of course after allowing our hero to make some glass knuckles.""",The Grey

The subsequent 100 minutes of film do not get any better.Two ladies chat peacefully at a bar while a bar fight rages behind them. A wolf charges a group of men around a car at a busy work site.

I think that was the first stupid thing. Secondly why is God doubted or even brought up in this movie if it was not a spiritual movie? I feel it was a way to insult God and make wolves seem evil and murdered rather than survival. There was really nothing survival about this and I thought It was.

The Grey is a hauntingly epic drama that uses the elements of man vs. Nature to tell a dramatic story of a man coming to terms with man's ultimate nemesis; Death. A group of Alaskan oilmen crash land in the arctic wilderness and are hunted down one by one by a pack of wolves. The wolf pack is symbolic as real wolves generally are not that hyperbolic in agression, but what they symbolize is the reality of life, death, and the unstopping power of nature vs. Man. If you go into this movie thinking it's a run of the mill action flick you will be sorely disappointed. This film hits a much deeper level of cinematic symbolism and messaging. It's dark and beautiful as the main character comes to term with death and the fragility of life. A true underrated cinematic masterpiece.",The Grey
543,talcol,The Grey: Another Movie Better Left Un-made,1,5 February 2012,"I took my family to see The Grey thinking it would be a reasonably entertaining movie based simply off of its IMDb ratings. I was wrong. The movie is a drab, depressing work from start to finish. About the only commendable performance in the movie was Neeson's numerous stoic looks depicting a man's tortured gaze into abysmal memories. If you like a movie with an occasional startling moment, but otherwise just dark, depressing scene after scene, then you might love it. Upon viewing the last scene of the movie, I believe the collective thought on the minds of the viewers was, ""We just sat through this and this is it?"" This was just a poorly made, uninspired creation that lasted way to long.",The Grey

I really don't know where to beging with because you can't imagine how bad this movie is until you suffer the painful experience of watching it. In fact,I laughed hard during a good part of the movie because of the many ridiculous situations the characters got involved... can you imagine that the only weapons they made during the action were sticks tied to cartridges? There are hundreds of no sense scenes, one after another. The feeling is of absolute absurdity. At the very end, I sided with the Wolfs, to end as soon as possible the torture.

545,JagersMom,More than a wilderness movie,10,16 May 2012,"Am I the only one that looked past a ""wilderness movie""? They survived a plane crash then they must battle wolves. Great! I am a big fan of Liam and this was another great performance by him. Other posters are whining about it not being realistic...really? It's a freaking MOVIE! It was never advertised to be some kind of Bear Grhylls type of adventure. **Spoiler Alert**For me this was a a story about a man at odds with faith. In the beginning as Lewenden is dying Ottway doesn't try to comfort him with silly notions of angels and heaven. Throughout the movie you see how losing his wife had made Ottway feel like there was no higher power. When Ottway is the only one left he asks for help, he wants proof that there is a higher power. Then he says forget it I'll do it myself. I think the ambiguity of the final scene after credits is for us as viewers to decide if we really believe in a god(s). It could be that there is no god or that there is but this was his fate all along. I like that it lets me decide the final outcome. Do we always need happy endings?

548,Montybunny423,My two cents on the Grey,8,17 February 2015,"From Writer/Director Joe Carnahan (Smokin Aces, Narc & The A-Team) The Grey is a harrowing adventure-thriller involving stranded plane-crash survivors; 6 oil-workers in Alaska who must survive the elements as well as escaping from a vicious pack of hungry wolves. Liam Neeson heads a decent cast and delivers a steady performance as always. The production value is quite good; the scenery is beautiful, the plane crash scene is scary, as are the wolves, Carnahan's direction is, as usual dead-serious but with a wicked sense-of-humor. I will not throw in any spoilers but most of the film's events are, for lack of better words; simply wicked!The camera shots are both spectacular and moody. The sound matches the film's tone: visceral and edgy. The dialogue is efficient, the oil-workers sound convincing as rough-necks. The wolves are portrayed almost like supernatural baddies. The film is overall a breath-taking edge-of-your-seat suspense thriller. For fans of exciting cinema-I highly recommend The Grey.",The Grey
549,dingusbird,Not too bad of a movie,5,18 July 2012,"SPOILERS. First off it wasn't too bad of a movie, what really bothers me is the growing trend for movie makers to include scenes that are ""cool, action-packed, or exciting"" at the expense of having the movie become so unbelievable that its hard to watch. For instance, the scene when they jumped off the cliff into the tree. ""Oh! lets have a really kewl shot where the guy jumps then there's like a big cliff and the audience gets anxious when the guy falls and then they get scurd when the wolves eat him and drag him away! Itll be so awesome!"" ... Nevermind the fact no one would do that in real life. Nevermind the fact they were WAY better off in the plane. Nevermind the fact that wolves do not in fact fly and would not magically be at the bottom of the cliff waiting at the exact tree for him to fall. And it goes on an on throughout the entire movie. What I liked about the movie was that it wasn't all nonsense action like the trailer suggested. The parts with the wallets were meaningful as well as the flashbacks to the crews family members. The scene I enjoyed the most was when the guy decided to give up and wait to die while enjoying the scenery. The slow revealing of why Liams character was so depressed was good as well. The poem added a bit to the movie too , I think if they focused more on the drama of survival as well as what it does to the human mind and less on the nonsense lets fight wolves with shotgun shells for 120 minutes it could've been way better. It probably wouldve been better I think if they weren't even any wolves. The cold is the only antagonist the movie needed, unfortunately I Think in these times people will only go to see movies that are boom this blow that up fight this rather than ones that make you think a reflect upon it long after its over. PS. for all those complaining the end scene was cut short without a fight I give props to the director for doing it like that. The 2 seconds of Liams character laying over the wolf after the credits said more than a 5 minute long action packed booze bottle fingered fight scene could've ever said.",The Grey
550,puneet_m17,And Grey it is..Not as dark as it should have been,6,23 April 2012,"The writers (maybe intentionally) tried to avoid pursue the same path as the remarkably realistic cult classic 'Alive (1993)' (true story) which was a momentous cinematic achievement that redefined the surviving a plane crash genre. It was a good thought to be innovative but by avoiding all the details of surviving injuries, extremely cold weather, dwindling spirits, dehydration, food, death etc. (as they were already been covered in the cult movie that I mentioned earlier) and concentrating mainly on a pack of wolves, makes the movie weak and pretentious.Liam Neeson though tries his best but comes across as confused. The moment ago he was suicidal and came very close to shooting himself in the mouth but after the crash he is the first one to take the lead to be alive. It is projected that he wants to be alive so that he could go to his loving wife. But later the director may have conveyed that she might be dead hence the attempted suicide. Maybe he had the will to survive in order to courier the wallets of the dead to their loved ones. Maybe he wanted a last good fight before he lived and died the same day.The wolf hunter finally gets his fight with the leader of the wolf pack and those who had the patience of sitting through the long final credit may have found out that he kills the leader wolf. Who cares whether the hero lived or died..he had his last fight which was not shown to us the audience. I think we deserved a good fight between the savage beasts and the man who was paid to kill them. But we never did. Not a single confrontation..just a hint of an attack!! I give this movie a six because of Liam Neeson..he does his best but..",The Grey

They made Wolf Taken. Violence and wolves!"" Well, they didn't. There's really not that much action in the film. The trailers really, really did a dis-service to the film. They were selling an action movie when they really made an intensely somber film about a group of desperate men as they try to survive a plane crash. The film is quietly beautiful.I saw it in theaters and was hopping mad at how the trailer misled me. People all over the theater fell asleep (my girlfriend included).

552,goksin_igneci,the Grey,6,23 May 2013,"Firstly, I mention that The Grey remains a genuinely gripping survival story and a refreshing change from stale urban action flicks. It is a good film. I recommend it. It is very excited. But its ending is not attractive. It is quite a survival tragic tale, it's not deep at all but you'll feel every bit of sadness in characters.I just can't imagine how Neeson survived and thrown out that far from other survivors when he strapped himself by two seat belts. Also, I think that while the wolves are in danger of being wiped out, this movie is only going to serve in maligning these poor animals more than they already are! Wolves to don't attack people. Wolves attacking people is totally out of character for them and it seems to only happen in the movies! Please put a disclaimer at the start of this movie so people know the truth!

553,carla1308,Chilling and Terifying,9,3 March 2012,"I went to see this movie with a few friends, thinking it would be a cool survival action flick. I was wrong.First of all, Liam Neeson is truly amazing as the lead character. The Grey is yet another success story to add to his impressive resume. His soft spoken Irish accent is a chillingly perfect contrast to the harsh setting and gritty violence of the movie. Yes, his character is in many aspects a cliché: the strong, silent, antisocial hero with a tragic past that takes on the position of the leader. But Neeson's brilliant performance will make you forget all about it.The plot of the movie is quite simple to understand. You have your standard plane crash in an inhospitable environment (in this case Alaska) and the fight for survival of a small group of people. Except here's the twist: unknowingly, they find themselves right in the middle of the territory of a pack of wolves. As they attempt to escape their unfortunate situation, the wolves are slowly hunting them down one by one.The Grey is a chilling thriller with a quick succession of terrifying scenarios (enhanced by the brilliant soundtrack) that will definitely scare you.

If you want a documentary-realistic film then... well don't watch the film.. or any film for that matter - stay home in your slippers and watch the Discovery Channel! Its like The Da Vinci Code reviews all over again - people, we are watching a FILM - a MOVIE, STORY, not a documentary so who cares if it doesn't perfectly portray the behaviour of Wolves... if it did, it WOULD suck!So for the movie review - WELL... If you want an eerie atmosphere and a fun, exciting, intense movie then this IS for you!!!!! A great film, and not being a fan of Liam Neeson's acting, I have to say, he did VERY well.....

Without giving too much away it's also a very depressing film which is what I expected. The characters are very likable even though Neesons character is a tad clichéd. The plot was different and quite realistic in regards to the wolves territorial behaviours,the special effects,stunts and the mens reaction to fear and isolation. I enjoyed watching this, even if it did make me feel cold to the bone, and even though it was emotional and touching at times there was still enough heart stopping action and terror to leave you satisfied.

557,martinemcmahon,A different kind of movie,9,29 January 2012,"Just a warning, this review will contain spoilers.The ending of the movie can be said to be ""sudden"" in that it's (spoiler) Liam running at the Alpha and then BAM! go to black (/spoiler) and the people behind me were freaking out going ""OMG it can't end like that!"" For one thing, the way it ended was perfect, because the type of movie ""The Grey"" is isn't just a cut and dry ""man thrust into wild, man struggles, man survives"" survival movie. It displayed a sense of realism that's often times not a part of real survival situations. It's too convenient that the plane crashes only a handful of miles away from help, and while that produces that heart warming ""Aww yeah we won against nature!"" feeling, that's not always what happens. This movie is about man struggle in an environment against a predator that's actually more fit for that environment than we are. We like to pride ourselves as a species for being ""the top of the food chain"", but what's often forgot to those who may or may not have a formal education in Evolutionary Biology is that ""the top of the food chain"" is a purely situation dictated phenomenon. In an arctic wilderness where we need 8 layers just to sustain life with a carnivore naturally adapted specifically to the environment, 9 times out of ten, what happened in the movie would happen in real life. I respect the movie, and the directors for that. It made me reflect who I was as a member of the human race in relation to the rest of the planet. The end of the movie leaving it up for your interpretation was actually perfect, despite what the movie goers behind me were saying. (spoiler)The ending was simple, yet powerful. Liam was in a situation he did not expect to get out of alive, yet knew he didn't have to go out without a fight...so he made it to where if he was going to die, so was the Alpha.

558,Ethanbbach,Go see the Grey,9,30 January 2012,"Quick! What do you call eight men whose plane crash landed in the Alaskan wilderness? If you answered, ""big bad wolf chow"" then you'd sure be headed in the right direction! But not if Liam Neeson can help it. Neeson stars as ""Ottway"", who is sort sort of a special hunter of these big bad wolfies, and at the same time must protect the members of an oil drilling team. When Ottway and company are finished working for the time being, it's time to head home, but not if old man winter has anything to do with it. The plane crashes in this has to be one of the more intense plane crash scenes to date. Think of the movie Cast Away and multiply it times 10. Now, after the plane crashes and everyone gets situated, things get interesting. Ottway assumes control over the group of survivors, showing them his survival tactics, but most importantly, how to survive in the wolves' environment. Let's be clear here, this is a rated R movie, and for good reason too: there are many ways to die in the Alaskan wilderness, with rabid wolves on the prowl and hypothermia. The wolves aren't the only conflict though, as the tension between certain survivors reaches a boiling point. Long storey short, it's a bloody movie, and doesn't pull any punches. This isn't a bad thing though, I'm weird and like this sort of stuff, I just thought I'd give a fair warning. Which brings me to my next point, and that is The Grey isn't only bloody, but suspenseful and somewhat scary too! I don't mean scary as in ""it"" the clown scary or even ""Arachnophobia scary, I mean ""Friday the 13th"" scary, as in you better not let your guard down during this movie. These are stealthy wolves, They can attack at any moment, and I got caught off guard a few times, almost slapping the poor woman in the seat next to me because I was so startled. This brings me to my one gripe against this movie, and that is this: If Ottway is such an expert in survival, they could've used more foliage from the plane wreckage to make walking sticks, or more weapons. Or at least steal the coats off of all the dead bodies to layer up some more, like randy's mom dressed up her son in A Christmas Story.Now that that's out of the way, let's talk about what the movie did really well, and as far as I could tell, was just about everything else. The acting was exceptionally well, with not only a good performance (as expected) from Liam Neeson, but from the supporting cast as well. And the dialogue was well written, making the characters more believable in these situations. And You'd think that all of the wolves being CGI would make the movie cheesy and hokey, but this is not the case, remember these wolves are vicious and scary.",The Grey

He works for an oil company in Alaska and continuously whines about his girlfriend, who died years ago in the hospital. (Or so I think.. I already was getting bored..) Anyway... They get on a plane and crash. Only seven people survive the plane crash and are now in wolf territory. Wolves are vicious beasts and natural killers. And thus they have to survive Arctic conditions, trying to get home while surrounded by gazillions of killer-wolves which are not afraid of humans nor fire. (incredible...) Using their superhuman strength they survive anything that would have killed a normal person, and in the end are all killed, not eaten by these vicious wolves..What I don't get, is why Hollywood would make a movie about wolves being human killers. This is pure propaganda. Anyone with some knowledge about wolves would know that they are afraid of humans and fire.

The obvious ones include, Liam Neeson's character is an expert on everything, the ludicrous cliff jumping scene, the ridiculous river scene where somehow Neeson's character manages to dry out from instead of freeze to death from, then of course the big fight scene where I believe he is taping broken mini-bar bottles to his knuckles to fight the wolves.

563,xtcsnowman,Wrap up warm and prepare to spend 2 hours biting your nails !,7,26 April 2012,"The Grey is one of those movies that doesn't let up for one moment. It puts you through the ringer from start to finish, ultimately leaving you feeling completely exhausted, which is swiftly followed by half an hour online to check out cold weather survival kits before your next plane trip over the tundra to visit Great Aunt Agnes.Liam Neeson, plays the world weary hero, who gives off that aura of 'knowing' what its all about, ie life, death etc and its not until near the end of the film that you kind of understand why. When I watch a movie, I always want to be able to root for at least one of the characters, but in this movie I never quite warmed to any of them. Very few of the 'b list' actors gave you a feeling that you cared either way whether they would survive or not. I don't know about anyone else, but I've got to like the character before I start rooting for them and none of the characters in this film deserved to be liked. Excepting of course the hero, who although we all knew was a good guy, was just far too depressing. OK so he had a lot on his mind, but come on mate smile a bit for goodness sakes.The scenery was great, the blizzards and feeling of cold came through well, and the plane crashing was really heart in the mouth stuff, but then you had some real disappointments. The wolves for instance (or what we actually saw of them) aren't at all scary, in fact that part of the movie seems to have been done on the cheap. A few shots of one or two recruits from the local zoo scampering along, or night scenes with some dodgy 'wolves eyes' looking through the darkness (and looking more like a few small lights held up on boards by the film gofers) didn't quite frighten the life out of you, which I kind of think was what the director was after, but failing miserably if it was. And some of the unreal wolf howling was so far over the top, that it started to get laughable.The whole film gave off a feeling of hopelessness and foreboding, but maybe that's what the film set out to do, so if that was the case, then it succeeded. I just wish more time and effort could have gone into making the scenes with the wolves more believable and frightening, in which case it could have been a real cracker.Having said all of that, I don't feel it was 2 hours wasted watching this movie, I just feel some areas could have had more money and effort thrown at it, which would really have made it a much better movie.",The Grey

All this analysis on how much a wolf weighs and how their behavior is incorrectly depicted... please stick to NatGeo or Discovery channel programs and stay away from fiction! Going by the logic and reviews, Spielberg's 1975 classic 'Jaws' should be given just a star or two as it has a highly inaccurate portrayal of sharks. But surprise surprise, it's 8+ on IMDb! Wow how did that happen?! I enjoy a movie for the entertainment value it provides. And if the film can hold my interest for about 90 minutes, I'd say it worked. The Grey definitely worked!",The Grey
568,tpetroi,A philosophical masterpiece,10,15 December 2019,"I watched this a few years ago on a whim and with little expectations. Expecting a Neeson action vehicle that could sporadically hold my attention while I double-screened with my phone, it ended up being my favourite flick from the tall, growling Irishman. I went from questioning dubious survival decisions and preparing to roll my eyes at how it would all end to realizing that this transcends almost anything I've ever seen. Top shelf, fearless filmmaking, this. Once you stop wondering how these men will survive to wondering how they will meet the inevitable, you'll walk away from it feeling changed, brandishing a new perspective on life, death, maybe even legacy. Made for the macho he-man that is smart enough to know there are things out there that he can't hope to overcome, so he finds strength in places he never imagined.",The Grey

People get knocked-off by the typical ways-that-mother-nature-kills.The wolves aren't especially threatening, and there're a lot of times you can't even see the animals. The premise of the setup for their man-against-the-wild was good, exciting plane landing in the snow. But right away the people start to do nonsensical things. Why did they leave the aircraft? Why couldn't they make weapons from the aircraft wreckage? Still I stayed with the movie, wanting to see how the predictable ending was carried out. Guess what? The ending is ambiguous and you are not rewarded for giving 90 minutes of your life to this movie.",The Grey

The point of watching a movie is either to be entertained, sometimes stimulate your mind, this movie did neither for me, who wants to leave the movie theater depressed. I'm not completely knocking it down because i'm sure some will enjoy it if they share the belief of the message the movie tries to make and as i said the acting was good. Anyway...promising at the beginning...then i got disappointed. nothing to watch again.",The Grey
571,suprmposng,Watch it for the poem if the wolf science beats you down,7,20 April 2014,"I enjoyed this film. Why? Because I barely knew about wolves. Apart from: they hunt in packs, have alpha males, and of course, howl. Because of this, I had put my trust in believing Ottaway's (aka Liam) wolf knowledge, just like all the survivors from the crash did. Now I feel a bit dumb reading all the flaws in the film via reviews. I was ambiguous about the facts in this film but I quickly put it down so I could enjoy it (leaning on believing the wolf expert).I also enjoyed the poem, ""Once more into the fray..."". It touched me on an emotional and influential level. If you are going to die, try living before you do so. By live I mean try, push, effort, that sorta live. The background story on his father and lover was just ""there"" to me. Wasn't very impacting on the story. It was clear the big wolf expert held on to his past deeply but I wasn't moved, probably because it's a common part in movies. However, the chats and thoughts they all had and the in-shock episodes most of them had were nice (is hallucinating shock so common though?).I liked the fact that the directors put such a ""don't underestimate"" front on the wolves, didn't expect that. But then again, now that I know my The Grey wolf from my actual wolf...There were a few other small scenes I enjoyed. Like how he strapped himself down in the plane (if that actually would save you in reality 0 I don't know).One reviewer said that ""this show is not... and is actually..."". That just goes to show, you can still enjoy it as you will have your own interpretation on it.What felt unrealistic was there moment he sorta let his guard down when he was the last man standing. I would never let my guard down to look at wallets or talk to the sky when there are savage wolves around. Though I let it slide simply by putting human variability on it. ""He could be such an expert that he knew when to let his guard down... he may have forgotten..."". Stuff like that. Ambiguity for the sake of enjoyment.About the ""what they should have done to save their lives"" part. I don't recall any of them being survival experts OR very innovative men. They mostly depended on the wolf expert.A trick I use on myself whenever watching movies is for whenever someone decides on doing what they have done when there could have been a far better way to do it is simply: human. I excuse them for that so it makes the show a bit more real. The same rule would apply for fiction, within the rules of the story, the ambiguity I place on myself holds. Keeps me from watching only half the film, which hurts. This gets me thinking, since Ottaway is not a wolf biologist and just knew a thing or two about wolves since he had to as a guard, maybe he just knew the wrong thing about wolves? This helps the movie get better rating from me (u_u). Can't help it.",The Grey
572,gdebruyn-779-165115,This movie was long and drawn out.,4,14 January 2014,"As a person who watches movies for pure enjoyment. This movie was dull and boring. The people who put high ratings on this movie apparently watch movies and try to figure out the underlying meaning of the film underneath all the B.S. This should not be classified as an action/adventure. The acting was good, but the story was completely unrealistic and just a huge waste of time. Critics love this type of movie. That's why I usually watch movies the critics hate. Watching a movie should take you away. If the movie doesn't totally draw you in, then its not worth paying $$ to watch. I am a movie lover and I watch tons of movies. Why this movie got so many high ratings I will never understand.",The Grey
573,born2shine87,"Enjoyable, but improbable",7,7 January 2013,"When reading through the reviews that people wrote for this movie there is one recurring theme; the wild inaccuracies and implausibility's in the storyline, that are being displayed in nearly every scene. Things like seven people surviving a plane crash without as much as a scratch on them, while all other passengers died immediately and the plane itself evaporated. Or predator wolves that display human intelligence. Or men jumping from a cliff into a tree 50 feet off, without losing any height. Etcetera. Especially for people that have encountered wolves, or that live in or have experienced the extreme cold of Alaska, I can imagine it is either pretty frustrating or laughable to see all these things on the big screen in a high budget production. Obviously it gets harder to enjoy a movie then, and it is understandable that those people cannot go further than 2 stars when grading this movie. However, I think that this movie is not made for those people, in the same way that E.R. and Scrubs are not made for doctors. The Grey is for those that can disregard all these inaccuracies (or are oblivious to them in the first place). If you are - like me - not an expert on wildlife in Alaska, then you do not have to feel cheated when you leave the cinema. I do not think that the producers failed to do research on wolves; I think they just realized that they cannot make a movie if they keep it realistic, and chose to go with the same kind of wolves you can find in cartoons instead. The acting is good, the panorama's are often beautiful, and even though most characters do not get properly introduced - which makes it harder to care about their fate - the movie is suspenseful throughout. The events are almost never predictable, and that is a big plus for a survival/thriller like The Grey. It is never boring, and only the end is a bit disappointing. An open ending does not fit with a movie like this in my opinion, and I hope it is not a prelude to a sequel; because that movie will, however, in all likeliness be quite unwatchable. Anyway, in short, this movie is meant for people who can be entertained by James Bond and superhero movies, and who do not feel like they have to hit their foreheads when a stewardess is walking through a crashing plane to calm down the passengers.",The Grey
574,alicesbeloved,Not only do I give it 1 Star I stopped supporting any film hes in since then,1,10 August 2016,"I enjoyed this film until near the end when he blasphemed and cursed God unapologetically and it was unacceptable regardless of the 'film' creative license. To do that...means one is comfortable hating your Creator on a personal spiritual basis; call it luceferian even. I was in shock and horror. I believe in love & peace and do not judge carelessly if at all but that action was judge worthy even more so then as it is right to judge a pedophilia behavior as abhorrent. So after which, I have never supported any film he was in and never will again. I understand why some may feel this is not a rating for the film; to those: kick-rocks lol. I rated this film a 1 Star in how lousy it became including that in script. Folks rate films on far less like the looks of a female being sexy, or a subject that supports their political interest, etc. No time for hypocrisy right now. They blasphemed & actually cursed God in the Script. This made what would have been a decent film awful. For his fans; get over it if you object to my critique.

575,binkpanther,Wolves are not even meant to be realistic,10,12 August 2019,"Personally I'm not a fan of telling people how they should view art. But often the movies with the worst reviews, are the most misunderstood ones.This movie falls under that category and specifically how the beast in the movie is shown, is clearly an artistic choice. They may appear clumsy, unrealistic or even supernatural, but that's done on purpose.You see they represent all the demons men have inside themselves.The movie is an allegory of pain, severe depression, meaninglessness of life, guilt, and the overall nothingness of not having a purpose or a meaningful identity.It's no surprise then there are no women among the survivors of the plain crash, as this depiction is made strictly from the point of view of male depression.As such, it's one of the best I've come across in all of cinema. Probably it's easier to write books about it than to make a movie of it. But this one is as close as it gets. People who have a need to understand a man who looks into the abyss, should watch it.There's also more subtle modern and sempiternal commentary of being a man. Stuff like how a pair of men introduce themselves to each other with their first names only after one has decided to forfeit his life. Only at that point can the role of a man be discarded.This tacit silence of man's fragility should perhaps be examined further in a separate movie. But to reference it in such a elegant way, gives the movie it's final star.",The Grey
576,gibb-duncan,"Its like Vegemite - You will either love it, or hate it.",8,12 March 2014,"This movie fantastic. Lets get that out of the way first. But, you either love it, or hate it, so here is an explanation of why:Hated it - Its was dark, edgy, some strange camera work and narrative, doom and gloomy, no ""Taken"" style badassery, movie was unrealistic, not what i expected, too art-house, too unbelievable, depressing, strange ending, etc. etc.Loved it - It's dark, edgy, some different camera work and narrative, its depressing and dour, unlike most big name movies, Liam Neeson has a real chance to shine, as its not all whoop ass, and shows some of his very real talent. The movie was very realistic in its setting, so real, that the movie had an unreal quality, as most big budget movies are the exact opposite, the movie was very stark, and very real in its depressing nature, and ending.You went seeing this, expecting a blackbuster action movie, where Liam Neeson hands everyone their ass on a plate, shouts orders, bombs, explosions, big action shots, a happy ending, instead what you got, was something gritty, and very well acted. The scene where he comforts a man to his death, is akin in its emotional content to the soldier begging for his life in the knife fight in Saving private Ryan, some of the character acting in this movie is superb, and the action scenes, such as the crash, are great, very enthralling, but not overly done, more focusing on the terror of it, rather than big explosions and people being sucked out etc. And as for the wolves, they could have been robots, or aliens, they where only wolves in my estimation, because of the location of the shoot, the movie wasn't about wolves per se, it was about the human condition, the futility, and accepting fate, it was about the interaction of desperate men, and the soul destroying mission they had no choice but to embark upon.So, to sum up. if you go to the cinema for big screen, big budget effects, action and adrenaline, then you wont like this.If you like any genre of movie, as long as its well produced, well acted and executed, and enjoy the art of the movie itself, rather than its big budget appeal, then you will love this gem.",The Grey
577,andrealvesfigueiredo,disappointing,5,21 September 2014,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***Being a Liam Neeson fan, I had high hopes for the movie. Boy was I disappointed. I couldn't even appreciate the art work of the movie because it was constantly striking me of totally and utterly ridiculousness. I don't't know a thing about wolves, nor am I an expert in biology but I think it's common sense that wolves don't act remotely close to what we see in the movie. I mean, I can forget about how real life is when I watch a movie but, being this a ""survival"" movie, I think it wouldn't hurt to be somewhat more based in real life, for educational purposes for instance. It it (in every sense) not the case. Other then that, the movie is filled with plot holes that are to ridiculous to appreciate anything else, like leaving the plane crash where you have the best chance to survive because you think trees provide better defense, outrunning wolves in snow that covers half your legs, completely and utterly ridiculous Wolfe behavior and the back story of Liam's character, with the wife and the father, was bad...to say the least.

The movie culminates in an extremely unsatisfying ending. And, judging by the comments and groans by others in the theater, I wasn't the only one who left feeling that way.The movie could have been great if they had shown a few more showdowns with the wolves, as was suggested in the advertising for the movie. At one point, Liam's character said they'd ""pick them off, one at a time"". This never happened, and they never tried to follow that gameplan. Too bad.Overall, above average, worth seeing if not much else is showing and definitely worth a rental.",The Grey

It was an over exaggerated, drawn out movie which gave the impression that it was going to be excellent, having Liam Neeson as the lead actor. I will never get these hours of my life back that were wasted watching it. It was predictable, blown out of realistic situations and just simply beyond tiring to watch. This movie is one that I highly DO NOT recommend unless you want to veg out on the sofa, reading a book and have it on in the background but certainly not a Saturday night movie of no means.",The Grey

582,Rose-Warren,A fight for survival just watching it. Very disappointing.,1,22 January 2013,"I don't usually leave film reviews but after watching The Grey I felt an overwhelming desire to save people from the absurdity of this shockingly poor and very disappointing film.It was a good start with a convincing plane crash followed by an engaging 'dazed and confused post crash' scene. After this, a touching scene, where Neeson supports a fatally injured passenger through his impending death. I thought I was on to a winner but then, like the fatally wounded passenger, it took a turn for the worse. When some mean, blood thirsty, man-eating wolves appear I started to doubt the premise of the film. I'm no wolf expert but I'm almost certain wolves don't hunt people in this way. They certainly don't viciously attack small groups of people minding their own business sitting by a campfire. The film implies that wolves are vengeful and spiteful and want to kill humans off for the sake of it, which simply isn't true.Neeson did what he could with the repellent and clichéd survival-expert character he had been given, but not one for the top of his CV. The others' performances were uninteresting and their characters came across as somewhat stupid. They learned relatively quickly that a wolf could attack them at any moment and yet they don't think to carry some sort of weapon like a branch or a rock or say the big fat knife that was used to cut the wolfs head off! But enough of the wolves, they're not even the worst thing about the movie.It continues along a path of crass ideas, my favourite being the group jumping off a cliff in to some tall trees in a bid to escape their toothy attackers. That was obviously not going to end well, and the rationale behind this act just added more absurdity to the film. Some very poor character development was attempted half way through the film by way of a boring campfire heart to heart, but this was too little too late, as by this time I really didn't care if any of them survived. I'm not sure if I was missing something but what actually happened to Ottway's wife? If she died just tell us. I don't want to have to spend the duration of the film trying to figure it out when it seems to be to be mostly irrelevant to the plot anyway. The attempted religious undertones of the movie were confusing and also irrelevant and made me ask what was this film actually about? Survival? Faith? Man-eating wolves? It couldn't really make up its mind.An hour and a half in to the film I kept watching, confident that Neeson was going to get himself out of this wolf infested Alaskan hell. But alas, instead I watched him fannying around for what felt like hours, piling up the wallets of his dead buddies (why?), whilst looking through their wallet sized family photographs. Cue sad piano music for emotional effect: but still I felt nothing because I really didn't give two hoots about these guys. To be fair to this scene however, the sad piano music may be its only redeeming feature, a beautiful piece by Jamin Winans.At last the finale. A bit of action I thought. Finally Neeson is face to face with the alpha male of the pack with a knife and some airoplane miniatures duck taped to his hands...show time. But NO! It was almost as though the filmmakers had gone over budget. Despite the fight scene actually being filmed (and appearing in the trailer!) the producers decided not to use it. Instead of watching what could have been a high octane wolf Vs man duel, I had to wait until the credits finished rolling for a two second shot of some fur and the back of Neeson's head. I can only assume this was a ploy to force me to make up my own mind as to who won this supposed battle. I actually felt angered and cheated at the end of this movie and I despise any film that makes me feel like this. It is everything I hate about bad movie making condensed in to two hours of my life that I will never get back. Throw it to the wolves and don't waste your time.",The Grey

As soon as things start to spin, you start to learn about characters, and develop opinions about them. Do all of the 7 survivors, co-workers, get along or will the drive to survive make them to get along? Or will the desire to survive make them show their true colors for bad or for good? I loved how they managed to surprise me with what going to happen next, few times (yes relax, some stuff that will happen you'll expect for it to happen).Survivors of the plane crash now try to survive wolves they crashed near. Liam Neeson, aka Ottway, is our skilled huntsman and one who through the movie shares with us knowledge about wolves and their actions so we wont only guess.Not all of the audience managed to sit through the whole movie, actually its the first time ever that I saw so many people leave in the middle. Its not easy to watch, so if your heart is weak or you don't want to know what can it take to survive, maybe its better for you to skip this movie :) Oh and if you thought only wolves making it hard for them to survive, maybe its worth mentioning it was 'snowy' in Alaska.",The Grey

I didn't like at the start, the guns were going off at the oil rigs to start the movie. Showing how in control they were then! Seems too scripted.A good movie to show the dire straits. Big wolves. Some ingenious weapons were needed.

589,Korovabar,Typical thriller/slasher movie,2,8 May 2012,"Seeing the commercial of this movie literally everywhere, I decided to watch this movie. I like the actor Liam Neeson and I like survivor - like movies. So what could I lose by watching this movie? I will divide my review in a few sections.Story: The story is nothing special; a plane crashes in the middle of Alaska and a few people survive. It's not really clear if the people know each other; some know each other, some don't know each other. Anyway, they start a fire to survive when they suddenly get attacked by malicious wolves! This is when the 'slasher' part will start. Anyone who watched movies like Friday the 13th, Halloween or Nightmare on Elm Street knows how this movie will roll. When the first victim gets claimed (note: he doesn't get eaten, only killed. It's a known fact only Polar bears and humans kill for just 'the killing'). After that, Liam Neeson decides 'hey you guys, we have a perfect hiding spot here where we can defend ourselves, but let's cross a large field of snow to go to a forest, while man-eating wolves are hunting us!'. Now, the typical roles unravel: there is the stubborn bastard type that won't listen, the leader and the one who supports the leader. The other actors don't have a specific role, but I will come to that later. One by one, they get killed.Then they reach a cliff, where they go Kamikaze and decide to jump off a cliff with a poorly build rope, made of clothes and other stuff. Not really surprising, one of the four (they start out with seven) falls off. No, he doesn't just fall off; he bashes his head in a tree, falls down painfully and even lives for a moment, when the wolves start attacking him! Where the hell did the wolves come from? It's a moment in the movie I actually laughed, because it was so ridiculous. A movie that's trying to be so dark and gloomy must NOT have a scene that's so over the top. It's a show stopper in a wrong way. After that, one of the three last survivors decides to just enjoy the view and wants to be left behind. No real explanation and you don't know what happens to him. What? They try to let you bond with a character the whole time (he was the bastard), and then they decide to not even kill him off, but just let him 'disappear'? That's just lazy. *sigh* Well, the two last survivors continue, with no weapon to defend themselves, through high packs of snow. Surprise, the wolves chase them! One of them (not Liam Neeson) falls into the water, gets stuck with his foot between two rocks and drowns. Liam Neeson jumps in the river and tries to save him, but couldn't figure out he was actually stuck....*scratches his head*. Again, a lame way to kill of an important character. It felt so cheap and lazy! Furthermore, the wolves are gone all of a sudden(this movie is a mess). With no signs of hypothermia after falling in a river in Alaska, Liam decides to go on after taunting God. (God is like: dude, you failed so miserably the whole movie...I'm not gonna help you!). Surprise: he actually gets trapped in the den of the wolves! It's laughable that they depicted the wolves as some kind of serial killers, but now the den looks like a typical fantasy 'lair', with bones scattered all around the place. And the 'final boss' is giant, monstrous alpha male. I was actually looking forward to this fight....but no! The screen goes black! What?! This was THE fight of the movie! It could've been one of the redeeming factors of this movie! But no, even the ending got messed up. Well, you see flash of a wounded wolf and Liam lying on the ground, but that's it. It's so...cheap. So lazy. So mediocre. All in all, this is a movie with a lot of plot holes, dumb decisions and horror - like clichés. The movie tries to be deep with some poetry and 'artsy' filming, but also fails in this category, because it's a shallow slasher movie at it's core. It comes off as pretentious and laughable. Cinematic quality: This is the only redeeming factor of this movie; it sounds and looks very nice. The special effects are well done and the lack of CGI (except for some wolves) really gives it a good atmosphere. The filming is also nice and divers. Acting: Liam Neeson just gives away his normal performance; nothing special for him. The other actors do an OK job, but nothing more than that. They are all stuck in there stereotypical roles, with no possibility to expand their characters.",The Grey
590,jcoria,Much Deeper than a survival film,9,13 July 2018,"Just a few comments about this Jack Londonesque movie. Beyond the surface this movie harpoons the great competitions of man versus man, man versus nature, man versus God and man versus himself. What the director was able to accomplish in this raw film is an inspiration. A man evolving from suicidal tendencies, a man who protected life but initially cares little of his own, revealed his true flesh of wanting to live. The ethereal remembrances provided a cloudy peek into his pain. The parallels of the pack of wolves and the pack of men within the indifferent universe. Oh my fellow watchers this visceral movie gives us hope, purpose and the untethered pang of raw survival. To rage against the cold, while the hungry wolves that lurk in our souls attempt to devour us. Those that rate this movie poorly lack the honed taste of organic storytelling.

It could have been a 10, but two serious flaws made it sink like a rock.1) I have never met anyone who actually PREFERS a movie in which ALL principal characters die.2) Using a film to attack people who believe in the existence of God is a stupid idea and alienates a large percentage of your audience.VERY RARELY is there a film in which leaving you totally in the dark about the ending is acceptable. 99.9% of those are expecting sequels. The notable exception being ""The Thing"" from 1982.When I saw the trailer for ""The Grey"" I got all excited and couldn't wait to see Liam Neeson fight that big wolf. Guess what? I'm still waiting to see it, though I left the theater half an hour ago. You DO NOT see it. WHY? Because the MOVIE ENDS as Liam charges the wolf.

What was the point of this movie????????? Pure rubbish. So many inconsistencies I don't know where to begin. Stewardess that seems to be able to defy gravity on a crashing plane that seems to have no air conditioning. Neeson straps himself into his row of seats with 2 seat belts yet he comes to completely free of these straps and not an airplane in site near him.I have to stop typing Im getting angry just thinking about it.

Because I know it can.Every horror fan usually knows this by the films they watch. If you mistake what happens in films as things ""that will never happen to me"",well,you'll learn.As The Grey opens on the cold,bleakness Liam Neeson appears as a man that has no dream of life left,no lies,no illusions.The reasons are not apparent. He is a sniper contracted to protect oil rig workers from infrequent wolf attacks,and shoots only when completely necessary.He respects the animal enough to know its dangers.His fellow humans he has much less admiration for,at least the ones he works with.They are the refuse of the real world,who deserve to be in the harsh conditions that he has chosen to be in.On a routine flight to return to civilization the plane crashes literally in the middle of nowhere.The sound editors and techs did such a fantastic job with this film you feel as close to everything that is possible without actually being there.Real depictions of crash victims-and the cold,the cold is a complete character on it's own.That would be enough to threaten your life.Then you are hit with the real fear.The primal one most of us have forgotten on our long ride at the top of the food chain. The line between our world of safety and 911 and sanity, and complete all bets are off,nothing will save you but yourself world, is very thin.He finds out in the worst way possible that the plane has crashed in the world of the wolf and they do not belong there.Having some knowledge of the animal, but not much else he scrambles to live and protect what is left of humanity in this unforgiving reality.The survivors try to cope as well as you or I could,and we are along for every terrifyingly tense moment.The Grey is real,raw,scary and so good you will be appreciative of every aspect of your life.Neeson is at his best when thrown against everything that man and nature fears, and it is a film experience.

595,skb218,Incomplete,5,31 January 2012,"I am a big Liam Neeson fan, I am from Alaska, and I love survival movies. I thought this would be the perfect movie for me. I was sorely disappointed. I will begin with the negative sides of the movie. The acting is okay, but not great. The filmmakers did that super annoying cinematography were the camera is two inches away from the action, whenever it happened, and I can't tell until the end of the scene what actually happened. Despite the constant swearing, the script was a little hard to swallow. They hardly talked, and when they did, it seemed forced and unnatural. The whole thing was a little too dramatic, as well--wolves were constantly howling like they were talking to the people. The way the characters were portrayed. Their intricate, but yet extremely similar, death scenes. It seems the makers of the film were more concerned with being extremely vulgar and brutal instead of crafting the story in a much more appealing way. Several things were overlooked--how did Liam Neeson end up about half a mile away from the plane and didn't get hurt at all? How did no one feel cold the entire movie until they were dying? The whole movie just seemed to be lacking detail. On the bright side, there were a few profound moments dispersed throughout the movie, mostly piling in at the end. Liam Neeson did just about as well as he could of with the role that he was given. There were good morals in it about the necessity of death, but the beauty of life. I just wish they were emphasized a little more. The set worked out really well. It looked real, and it helped build the case of the believability of the movie a little. As for the ending, I don't believe they could have done it any better. It's pretty apparent how it would have turned out if the movie had continued. If it had a happy, Disney-story ending, it would have been absolutely ridiculous and not at all realistic. If the movie had played out and ended badly, then the moral of the story would have been completely lost. It was profound the way that it happened. He started out as a suicidal man who thought there was no reason to live, but by the end, he wasn't going to give up without a fight. Also, if they would have showed more death, the gore would have distracted from the moment that occurred right before it.All-in-all, I wish that they had spent more time with detail and story/character development. The raw storyline was pretty much set in place, but it lacked the bulk of the story--the part that the audience could connect with. I wouldn't recommend it, but maybe if you're really bored on a rainy day, it would be worth burning two hours of your time. Not $8 and a movie ticket, though.",The Grey

599,cathywatson-642-817845,Really wanted to like it!,5,27 January 2012,"I love Liam Neeson as an actor and go to see whatever he is in. His acting is on par as usual in this film, but it was the script that was lacking. A big plus was the level of suspense that was kept up throughout - it will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time! If you love things that startle you and make you jump, this is your kind of movie. Now the bad, at least 100 uses of the F-bomb that weren't really necessary, and over time, were kind of distracting. (I don't think there will ever be a TV version of this movie as there would be very little usable dialogue.) Plot also left a bit to be desired, but could have been redeemed if it had a different ending.

The anthropomorphism depicted by the wolves' behaviour was risible,(as were the special effects, particularly the glowing wolves' eyes in the dark-----about 30cm apart by the look of 'em). The tenets of survival in a hostile environment are Protection (self), Location (try to inform potential rescuers of), Water, Food. IN THAT ORDER. So, faced with -20c and blowing 40kts, pursued by hyper-intelligent enormous wolves, our hero et al leaves the windbreak of the wrecked fuselage, (with fuel and possibly location devices), and hoofs off in search of? You've guessed it, food. Were it not for the clichés and expletives, there'd be no dialogue at all, (no bad thing perhaps). This is the silliest film I've sat through in a long time. I only did so in the hope that: ""it must get better than this?"" It didn't. How Ridley Scott allowed his name to be used on the credits, I'll never know. I was going to title this misguided hokum!

It's a movie about people stranded in the wilderness fighting wolves. That's it. The premise is nothing original, yet the movie tries to be something more, when it isn't.It is full of unnecessary flashbacks that add nothing to the story, the movie constantly cuts to Neeson's wife, but what does it matter? What does his childhood add to anything? The characters are constantly stopping in the wilderness while being hunted by wolves to have long drawn out cheesy dialogues. The wolves behave more like demons than any animal living on earth, and 20% of the movie is slow motion scenes with no sound.Not to mention the anti-climatic cop out ending.

I guess the main thing I keep coming across is how ""ridiculous"" and ""unrealistic"" the behavior is that the wolves exhibit throughout. Here's what I say to that... Jaws was, and still is, one of the greatest creature features of all time... but guess what. The fact is sharks don't behave the way Bruce did either... nor do they come back to life and seemingly target an individual family for several sequels... just saying. Come on people, it's Hollywood. The film portrays a fictitious story created solely for your entertainment. It's not meant to be a National Geographic special.This film, in my opinion, is amazing. The story is engaging, the characters are believable, and for the most part it keeps you on the edge of your seat. But perhaps the most profound element of this film is its ending, and I'm not going to spoil it for you but I will say a couple of things... a lot of folks may be put off by the way it ends because you may feel a bit left in the dark. It is a bit of a cliffhanger. But the whole end sequence is so powerful I don't think I'd have it any other way. If it doesn't give you the chills, you're just inhuman! If you do feel let down, though, watch all the way through to the end of the credits... there's a short treat for ya. Anyway, give this film a chance for sure.

The wolves feel more like something out of a horror film than an actual threat of nature. Not one character puts up a fight before dying, if Neeson is supposed to be some kind of inspiration it wasn't showing.If you take this as a fun flick where everyone dies, you will again be disappointed, it's just unbelievably dull.

606,kasnaseem,An average movie,5,4 February 2012,"I had great expectations for this movie, but was extremely disappointed at the end. Don't know what's up with all the people giving this movie 10/10 or around that, because the moment I walked in to the cinema, there were very less people, I could hear somebody snoring at the back, two of my friends had already left in the middle of the movie. **Spoilers** Its a movie about an Oil drilling team who after plane crash got stranded in the cold deserts of Alaska. Then come the pack of wolves and hunt them down one by one, yes, one by one, nothing surprising. I would just divide my review in two parts:Good: The movie is directed really good. Its pretty real, the harsh conditions the characters were going through, almost you could feel them. In short, the cinematography was wonderful, 9/10.Bad: Lack of story, too simple. We don't know anything about the characters, where they came from, what were they doing in the coldest part of the world. There were possibly many goofs here and there, like finding shotgun bullets after the plane crash meanwhile we have seen Liam Neeson using rifle in the beginning. The director showed us that its quite difficult to walk on the snow, almost all of the characters were actually walking with the support of their knees, because their shoes would sink every time they take a step and the walking goes on, but how on earth did they manage to outrun the wolves while they were being chased by them towards the woods? Survivors managed to survive for few days and nights and were able to move around the desert, but help never arrived, I mean its a plane crash with WORKERS in there. I like how the director has only portrayed Liam Neeson the only courageous and brave person while the other survivors from plane crash were a bunch of old whiners (just like in every other movie). There was no element of surprise in the movie which would get the audience's attention with their eyes actually wide open (except the plane crash part). Its a movie in which you sit back, relax, put your headphones on, chew on the munchies, drink Pepsi as you watch survivors getting eaten one by one because you would know where the movie is going when the survivors got stranded after the plane crash. 1/10.PS: The ending was the most stupid one, I mean does Liam Neeson survives or gets killed, no one knows, the audience kept sitting on their seats when the screen blacks out hoping something interesting would pop up after 117 wasted minutes of the movie until the credits started showing.You want to watch this movie, best you wait for the DVD version to come and watch it at home, no need to waste money on the screening.",The Grey

Stupid wolves, trite characters, boring story line, and it just make you cold watching it. It's long, drawn out, and uninteresting. It's completely unrealistic to boot. There's very little character development and it's hard to even like the protagonist. The special effects (tons of CG snow!) aren't very good and the scenery is underwhelming. I'm a huge Liam Neeson fan but I have to say that this movie really was disappointing. It's quite long too, and the whole time I kept thinking about how I wished it was finished!

Nobody ever looks particular chilled -- no blue lips, chattering teeth or uncontrollable trembling, like I know I'd be experiencing. (Neeson did have frosty cheeks at the end.) I was colder in the theater than these guys seemed to be. And I've seen dogs who were house pets that could look scarier than these wolves. They should have been all bare teeth and gums, and that horrible non-stop snarl that makes your blood freeze in your veins. These wolves just howled a lot, and were occasionally very fast.

609,pav_cherry,Superb,10,1 February 2012,"The Grey, 9.8/10 stars, doc .2 for forced emotion from Hendrick at the end yet what a b-c rated supported cast did with such little time left gave me shivers. I for one have only criticized what turned out to be a diamond in the rough from its flashy action-lent trailer. I had low, to medium low expectations of this movie's idea, theme, or story succeeding. I was sorely mistaken. Hats off to Joe Carnahan, a director once given the ""R""-rating, has used the tool-set for making the movie serious & ""REALISTIC."" This is nothing like his past works Smoking Aces or A-Team. In fact we are blessed he took the time to integrate enough of each survivors back story into their character development. What I thought was going to be a ""guess who dies next film."" Turned out to be ""me at the edge of my seat, pulling my hair, while trying to turn away but not."" Only to feel as helpless as can be as a friend, father, husband, or brother's life was about to be taken. From the start with the shaky cam, to the final moments of the film, I was speechless to say the least after this intense journey of will, soul, and impending doom. Ultimately The Grey has humbled me rightfully, for judging a book for it's cover. Many will see this movie and only criticized the actors for not doing more or making better choices. Given the situation a handful of plane crash survivors are given. The Grey choose to not follow cliché' expectations, but plow away from the beaten path. If it were instead a crowd pleaser. We never would have seen the honest integrity of each man, everyone really working as a team, or simply one man making all to at least believe that they can live or die trying. The Grey, unfortunately, will mostly be judged by it's ending. We expect to pay for quality, many will say it's lazy or writer's shortcut. When I saw the movie, after watching all experience raw nature humbling the everyday, invincible, American-minded man.

Don't make me laugh. The choices Ottway makes start good and go bad than to worst during the movie. And when they jump off the cliff and the wolves are already waiting. these are demons,with teleportation abilities, not animals!!! Finally they got down to two and the wolves attack, but suddenly when one of them falls in the water, the attacking wolves disappear! How convenient. Bad story, nothing to do with reality.

612,tom_barnes02-270-105083,Taken with wolves? Not at all,7,30 January 2012,"Taken with wolves? Hardly but it would have been an interesting concept. Over the past few years Liam Neeson has turned into a reasonable action star with films such as taken and unknown but does his latest movie offering have the same gravitas So it's a disaster drama set in Alaska and revolves around a team of oil workers. The vast lands are inhabited by wolves and our would be hero Liam Neeson is a hired Gun who stops the attacking predators causing any troubles for the workers. After a long haul doing his job and flash backs to a relationship he once had it's time for the workers to head on home on the last flight out. But alas, a freak incident occurs which leads to the planes passengers stranded even further out in the snow covered plain's with only there wits and a cargo full of dead bodies. The main part of the story though revolves a round the remaining crew finding there way out of a desperate situation whilst being stalked by wolves through out there journey. It's a real interesting story and I thought it was well told. I though Liam Neeson was really well cast for this part. The main man is a gruff, rough and tumble troubled soul and Neeson fits the bill perfectly. It is primarily a Neeson film so the supporting cast were a little over shadowed by his solemn man performance but there were a good variety of characters to keep the story progressing nicely. Other than the actors you only had to take the wolves into consideration and sometimes I found the digital wolves a little obvious, but I still wouldn't screw with them pooches. The story is fairly linear and hops in and out of flash back sequences to Neesons wife and an occasional trip back to his younger days but it does it in a sentimental way which makes you care more about the character. I though in parts it was beautifully shot and in one scene in particular I found my self slightly moved which involved one of the characters last moments as he stares into oblivion. The film also boasts the occasional fright which really impressed me because I thought this was going to be a straight forward action epic. All this a side there are a few issues. In parts it feels a bit baggy, it could have been a little tighter and perhaps been shortened down to a more comfortable hour and forty minutes and sometimes it became a little to predictable but for the best part it had me gripped.A harrowing tale with the occasional scare, a serving of emotional turmoil and Liam Neeson playing a solid lead. I really enjoyed the thrill of these men being stalked by wolves and the pros out way the cons for sure. Maybe there could have been a little more wolf interaction but I guess the film was trying to say more about the stranded men's relationships, and that was fine by me.

I enjoyed this movie not only for what the suspense provides (a constant alertness) but also some of the shots are astounding the one which comes to mind is (SPOILER ALERT) When they are in the trees after eating the wolf and the Alfa wolf begins to howl, the steam from his voice are the only things visible and as the other wolves join in there are more and more breath vapours in the air.

There was a good balance of psychological scares and ""jump scares"" to keep the viewer always on their toes. I usually don't like jump scares but I didn't mind them in this movie. The Grey is by no means a horror movie, but that doesn't mean it wasn't scary either. There were numerous times where a literally jumped out of my seat. The acting was very good and the wolves were, most of the time, quite frightening.This movie isn't for everyone though. There is a lot of violence and gore that some people may find quite disturbing. This movie has such great acting that it makes these horrific scenes seem much more realistic.All in all, this movie has great action and tension with superb acting.

This show barely gets to that point. For example: Ottway tries to save a fellow survivor in a near-frozen river; is mostly submerged for 2 - 3 minutes, yet climbs out of the river, and sits on the snowbank without any signs of hypothermia whatsoever.

617,broms71,One of the best films in recent memory!,10,31 January 2012,"I thought this movie was amazing. Yes, the previews tell a different story of Liam Neeson going to war with a pack of wolves, but I'm so glad it didn't turn out that way, even though that's what got me to see it in the first place. The movie in itself is a story of (spoiler alert) how to handle death when it approaches. Will you cower away or go out like a man or a hero.In this film, the emotion mixed with tragedy and chaos intertwine beautifully. These rugged men who are known as criminals and the outcasts of society are facing real life fear and horror and how will they react when they don't have the upper hand? Neeson plays the leader of course, but he's faced with the task of not only getting back to his wife who apparently left him (I won't be spoiling that part) but he wants to save the men he's with as well.I thought the supporting cast was amazing especially Frank Grillo as Diaz and Dallas Roberts as Hendrick. Neeson has great chemistry with these two in particular and it shows on the big screen.Back to the story. Anyone who doesn't relate to this must be perfect. I'm not going to get into the religious aspect of it, but the generals. What would you do in your last moments? How would you look back on your life? How hard would you fight in order to survive and would you look into the face of tragedy as it approaches or would you bow out? It's this unbelievable story that tugs at your heart strings and demands your attention.The ending in particular will leave you with a lingering feeling that won't go away. I saw this movie five days ago and I still can't stop thinking about it. I would recommend this movie to anyone. The dialog was amazing, there are no real dull moments as the story continues to go deeper and deeper as it progresses and Neeson gives the performance of a lifetime. He should be up for the Oscar next year for best actor because he clearly delivers and has earned at least a nomination, if not a win.",The Grey
618,emcartersf,"Review for those who loathe films by/and/or staring Michael Bay, Stephen Summers or the Wayans Brothers...",9,6 February 2012,"I'm writing this review to give The Grey the credit it deserves after reading a surprisingly high number of underwhelming reviews. The most important notion to take into The Grey is that it's not your traditional, clichéd man vs. animal/hunting/hunted film. The film is an almost perfectly executed metaphor of a man battling his inner demons in one of the most remote and darkest corners of our earth (with nature and the wolves representing said demons). If you are patient enough to understand this and allow the movie and characters to evolve, you will be richly rewarded and enjoy the experience.The film embodies a number of themes including personal tragedy, the loss of life, the importance of family, and vulnerability. There's a particularly subtle, yet powerful scene where Liam's character tries to convince one of his more hardened survivors that it's okay to be scared... that when facing death there's nothing shameful about accepting what is. The film has an atypical ending... I will leave it at that. I will admit - however embarrassing it may be - that I almost jumped out of my seat with joy when the credits rolled. I think The Grey has one of the most satisfying endings I've ever experienced in a film. And by satisfying I mean that the ending perfectly concludes the story... it makes the story whole... its gives the film it's integrity. I still cannot think of a way to end this movie that would make it any better. I won't go into the story's details in order to preserve the experience, but here are a few thoughts...The film had a modest $25/35m budget. That's 1/10th of your average Michael Bay shoot. Most of the money probably went to Liam. The only aspect that could have been better was some of the CGI... but it was only two or three scenes at most. It isn't terrible, it's just below par in a Cameron/Jackson $300to$500m budget world. Remember, the wolves complement the story. The story is not dependent on CGI, hence if you appreciate the movie for what it is, then it's a non-issue. The score is haunting and emotional. It's been a challenge to recall an earlier score that matches it's film so well. In my opinion, this is Liam Neeson's best acting role to date. Period. The last five minutes, particularly the last frame, are timeless. And when the day comes when we look back at Liam's career in retrospect, I believe this is the role that will be remembered. If this doesn't warrant a best actor nomination after the Academy snubbed Fassbender in Shame, I will never watch the awards again. Carnahan has really emerged as a storyteller here. Looking back at his previous work, it's evident Carnahan knows how to excel with violent, humorous action; i.e. Smoking Aces and The A-Team. The Grey however is more Narc than the previously referenced films. It is truly a masterful step up. Instead of going with a bigger budget and ""who's hot now"" actors, Carnahan has turned to a smaller-scale, character-rich story... and he succeeds overwhelmingly. It's refreshing to find a movie that circumvents most of the clichés and pitfalls that scuttle most films from solid to subpar. If you want a beautifully shot film, a career-defining lead acting role, a rewarding script, a decent supporting cast, a moving score, and above all a movie that takes you places you may not want to go... then go see The Grey. Once more into the fray... Into the last good fight I'll ever know... Live and die on this day.... Live and die on this day....",The Grey
619,ashley-hinshaw10,Oh dear...,1,7 February 2012,"I don't understand why this movie was such a big hit with some people. It certainly did not deserve 7/10 stars!! It had nothing that kept me watching, except that we had paid nearly 20 bucks for our tickets and that this was suppose to be ""a date"" with my honey. That's right, my husband decided to see a movie, and to my not-so-surprise he chose this one. I'm all in for a good action movie, but, on that same note, I need a little preparation for gory, horror movie. Neither of us knew that this was going to be a ""survival-thriller"". But even that I could handle. What I couldn't handle, was the unnecessary but constant use of the F word. And I won't lie, every time it passed Liam Neeson's lips I had to laugh because it just didn't work, I just kept thinking, ""No, Aslan, stop!!"" I am a very ""story line focused"" movie watcher, and that is really where this movie failed me...>>>>>>> *** Spoiler Alert *** Spoiler Alert *** Spoiler Alert***<<<<<<<<In case you didn't notice, this half of the review WILL contain some spoilers!! To me this was a movie that can only be excused if it's based on a true story. But it wasn't.. as far as I know, and even if it was, there was no point to telling it. Everyone dies! And then to add to the story the ""scene at the end of the credits"" is just Liam Neeson laying with the alpha wolf... Was he dead? Did they make up and become best friends and decide to live together in the frozen wilderness? No one knows. And honestly, no one cared at this point. He, unlike all the other men, had no reason to live, nothing to fight for, except maybe the other men's lives, but then they all died, so.. And then there was a part toward the end where Neeson just goes on an insanely disrespectful atheistic rampage for 10 seconds and then it goes back to the regular movie. I almost left the theater at this point and I lost a LOT of respect for Liam, this scene was SO unnecessary and, if anything, took more away from the movie than everything else already had! The deaths in this movie were predictable, and dramatic. There were a few ""jumpy parts"" that were mildly entertaining, but other than that, I could not wait for it to be over. In conclusion, I truly believe that if Liam Neeson had not been in this movie, it would not have made it to theaters. Also, my husband never gets to pick the movie again. And that's my review! Thanks for reading and God bless! ~Ashley",The Grey
620,klaras_kitchen,"Depressing, Grim & Short On Credibility!",2,17 February 2012,"I knew nothing about this movie when I went to it as a synopsis was not available at the film theatre we attended. Being a fan of Liam Neeson, I was happy to take my chances with ""The Grey"" as I generally admire his work and enjoy his movies. Was I ever wrong about this one!!! I concede that Neeson & the cast performed moderately well, creating believable, though rather unlikeable characters, but I found the film to be grim and depressing. I couldn't even pass the time looking at the scenery as most of the film was set in a blizzard. I also struggled with the portrayal of the wolves as almost demonic creatures. I thought we'd moved past this sort of stereotyping of these magnificent creatures. Frankly, I wish the wolves had succeeded about 1 hour and 45 minutes earlier! This movie provided no entertainment value for me at all and had I been at the theatre alone,I would have left after the first 20 minutes. Many aspects of the film were simply unrealistic and rather insulting to anyone in the audience with any intelligence or common sense. Neeson wasted his time and talent on this movie.If you enjoy blood & guts, don't care about story quality, like to feel depressed & don't mind a grim outcome, pop along to this movie. If that doesn't sound like you then give this movie a miss. I wish I had!!!",The Grey
621,evaris,Surprised by all the bad reviews,8,29 February 2012,"Am glad that I didn't listen to all the bad reviews. In fact I had second thoughts before I booked the tickets due to the bad reviews but my wife persuaded me and am glad she did. Directed skillfully by Carnahan buoyed by beautiful backdrop and a gifted visual, he has managed to bring back Wolf Phobia. Liam Neeson was great as usual, matter of fact this a bit different movie he has done in a while. The side actors have also done a terrific job and some scenes are really heart wrenching but never the less this movie was all about survival and people who like such movies will really enjoy, on second thoughts I think everyone will enjoy. Pls don't go in with high expectation and a great story line, this movie is not about that.",The Grey
622,diva-artist,Could of been a much better film...,4,3 March 2012,This movie lagged in everything. No good actors. No real context to this movie. Just lots of really unbelievable EXTRA large wolves and blood. Lots of the same thing over and over. And the wolves look fake. Cursing and doubts about a God of any kind. You would think in a horrendous survival situation that REAL people would at least show some respect for their creator. The cast is 99% atheist. And the ending is so bad that it completely ruins the movie. Don't waste your money on this one. If you want to see a movie along similar genre i would recommend The Edge or ALIVE. This movie is a waste of time and money. You have been advised!,The Grey
623,benjones1985-309-464088,Not Great,6,14 March 2012,"I had high hopes for this one going in, Neeson makes a good film and the 'man stuck in the wilderness fighting for survival' premise looked an interesting one....fail!The film is slow, so slow it felt like it was going backwards at some points. The only highlights are the over the top deaths which spring up every 10 minutes or so, if it's not insatiable wolves it's plane crashes, frost bite or a good ol' fashioned drowning! Apart from these fleeting bits of action there's not a lot else too it. The suspense is weakened by the inane shots of the group walking through snow and the plot is well, well there isn't really a plot?With a poor did he / didn't he die ending the whole thing is just lacking in content and delivery. Disappointing!",The Grey

I would be pressing it to even call it a good movie. I found it predictable, depressing, boring and slow.I thought the premise showed promise, but the execution was lacking. The acting was just so-so, the action was lame and I could not empathize with the characters. I found them shallow at best.I was not caring and hoping for the characters and I really didn't care what their fate would be.

625,kletusramses,"Focused, bold, good enough",7,5 May 2012,"The problem with many films today is that they try to be too many things at once. Perhaps they shoot for drama, comedy, suspense all in one. This is not the case with The Grey. This movie is a survival thriller with Liam Neeson in it. How could it be bad?It isn't bad. It isn't great either, but it doesn't have any pretenses about it and it isn't over-acted. The editing is good, the mood is appropriately somber, the intent is clear. Will they survive? Wait and see. That's what movies like this are supposed to be about. Hopefully in a survival flick we care enough about the characters we're watching to stay engaged throughout the the film. Neeson's character is no sweetheart we are meant to fall in love with; he is a hard, no-nonsense type that I found myself cheering for. This film has a measure of consistency to it. It doesn't falter along the way. Many people have whined about the lack of realism with this or that in this movie. Really? Are they experts on Alaskan wolves? Who cares if what an animal does or does not do is precisely accurate? Movies are meant to entertain, hopefully delivered with some artful direction and good acting. The Grey is not a lovey-dovey, typical Hollywood flick that people will walk away from feeling satisfied. It dares to be different, and for that I take my hat off to its director. Well done.",The Grey
626,swedishfish88,Watch this movie without any preconceived notions,9,22 May 2012,"I just finished this movie (at 2:30AM nonetheless) and had to write up my first review for a movie on IMDb after having read the top 8 or so reviews (all of which I believe came into watching this movie with an agenda.) First, allow me to tell you why this movie received a 9/10, but allow me to preface this all with there WILL BE SPOILERS ahead (very mild, but they're there), so read with caution...This movie was not made in the style of Taken, nor is it some superhuman survival tale. It is gritty, it is raw, it is palpable. You will feel what the characters are feeling, you'll experience shock, horror, fear, anger, elation, and depression all in the greatest of magnitudes (well, maybe not humor in the greatest, but there is humor to be had...) And after all of those, you'll be left there on the edge of your seat, jaw on the floor, mind spinning a million miles an hour, fists clenched, and soul aching to find something of worth in this world. This movie isn't about wolves. It isn't about Liam's jawline. It's poetry. Pure, unadulterated poetry in cinematic form. I'm a guy, and I don't cry easily. I cried during the end of Life is Beautiful, and at my grandfathers funeral, and when my first girlfriend broke up with me many years ago. But this movie stirred me to the brink of having an emotional breakdown. The scene alone where Diaz is left behind and the camera slowly creeps in behind him... I felt that, with every bone in my body. Liam's final scene with the alpha male was gorgeous. The wallets strewn around him, his final note to the world, and his parting words ""Into the fray once again..."" they were all simply harrowing. I'm actually having a hard time putting into words what this movie's done to me, I think I described it best when I said it will touch your soul...

Many people complain about the film on the level that the wolves' behaviour is unrealistic, (as you might in so many other films with creatures in them) however if you are willing to accept that the predatory behaviour of the wolves has been exaggerated, the film is quite compelling and entertaining to watch.The interactions between the surviving men were interesting, and I felt a good exploration of certain personality types put under extreme pressure. Liam Neeson was particularly good in his role.This film is a good evening's entertainment. It will not make you think too much, but nonetheless keeps you watching and wondering up to the end, which I'm glad to say was not too contrived.",The Grey

They appear to come to all the wrong conclusions for all the right reasons. If you've got even a little bit of knowledge about wolves, or survival in an arctic environment, this film will leave you smacking your forehead and screaming ""You idiots!"" at the screen.The wolves are hokey, and far too big to represent the typical wolves found in Alaska. Furthermore, the behaviors exhibited were not entirely accurate.Worse still, the supposed expert played by Liam Neeson appears to know next to nothing about wolves, and leads the survival party toward the only cover, in the mistaken belief that the wolves don't den there.

Its worth watching even if 500 people complain it wasn't good enough for them. The only thing i didn't like was how they ends it but it wasn't anywhere near a deal breaker for me. The plot was good, the acting was fantastic, the wolves were slightly unrealistic but awful close for not using real wolves to attack actors.

However, as this story grew less and less interesting, the flaws really added up. I often ignore nonsense in a movie in exchange for entertainment. Once I gave up on this film, I began to pick it apart. Forget the unrealistic behavior of the wolves, the ending killed everything. Do a little math. Estimate the distance they hiked from the plane and imagine that as a radius. Now create a circle. What are the odds he lands in the den? The odds are not good. Throw in the giant cliff separating the den from the plane wreck and it begins to make enjoying the movie very difficult. I saw good reviews of this movie. I was excited to see this movie.

632,gdewald,The Grey Falls on it's face - SPOILER,2,10 July 2012,"I like Liam, he's had a real career resurgence of late and some of his movies such as Taken and Unknown were gripping and well worth watching.The Grey, however, never really gets off the ground.The initial sequence of events is fairly well done, although we are never really let into exactly who the character is and why he wishes to kill himself, which is eventually revealed later in the movie. The scenery is fairly real and probably depicts quite well what it's like to work in the north on some of the oil fields. The plane crash scene is well done, and fairly believable. However, once the wolves come in, things get a little crazy.First of all, I'm not a wildlife expert, but I consider myself fairly well read and knowledgeable. Putting aside the fact that less than 1 hour after a plane crash the wolves began to show up (what, was their 'den' around the corner when the plane crashed in the middle of a field or side of a mountain with no cover?) which is absurd. With that racket I doubt any wild animal would show it's face for at least a day or more. Further, everyone knows wolves are generally scared of people, and petrified of fire, it's ridiculous to think they would actually band together to attack humans.But, let's put that aside and say they do. When we first see the wolves, they are HUGE and obviously fake. Most wolves are like medium to large dogs, 100lbs would be a good size wolf in winter. Everyone knows this. These wolves were obviously fake and looked to weight 150- 200lbs, they were bigger than my great dane I used to have!OK, so wolves don't really attack people, and they look fake, but who cares, it's a movie right? Well, on and on we go with the predictable story of one character being offed after another while we hear their weak story's about their past lives. Finally, after traveling for days and what has to be I don't know, 30-50 miles, Liam walks right into the wolves den and faces the final fight. But wait, if the wolves den was 30-50 miles away, how did the wolves show up at the crash sight so quickly??Liam, you'll have to go one more time into the fight with another move, because you don't want this to be your legacy.",The Grey
633,mkjoffe,Marmite,8,27 August 2012,"This is a Marmite film - you're either gonna love it or hate it. The wife got bored halfway through, announced that it was bonkers and left me to it. Sure, there are illogical decisions in it but ignore these and focus on the adventure. This film is being readily attacked for being silly and inconceivable (as are most films?), but if you sit back and accept that the many scenes are the building blocks of the film then its easy to get drawn into Ottway's world.The film builds up characters whilst at the same time keeping the central, lead character well balanced. Liam Neeson is a brooding, mysterious actor who holds Ottway's sense of purpose together throughout the film. Some of the characters have 'victim' stamped on them from the beginning, whilst others hang on a bit longer than you think. The background music helped keep things ticking along and the ending completed the story.My criticism of the film is that when the camera shot is close to the action, the wolves are a bit too puppet-like. In this age of CGI, a bit more time and effort could've been spent making them 'life like'. Perhaps dropping the video footage of them altogether and emphasing their sounds and the movement vegetation would've been an interesting approach to build up the suspense.",The Grey

635,dylan_386,Ending Saved the Rating,6,20 October 2012,"During the first half of the movie, I wanted to shut off my blue ray player and leave the room. After about 50 minutes of the movie, I did. There is nothing spectacular and unique about the story. Every event that happened was predictable. My first complaint is about the audio. I couldn't stand the constant difference of volume. I could never hear the characters voices without turning up the volume enough so that when the wolves attacked it was deafening. One minute it's so quiet that you need the subtitles to decipher what they're saying, the next, so loud that you regret not having the t.v on mute...The characters should be called actors as they never developed enough for me (till the end) to attach on to them. As they died, I never felt sad or sorry at all. The only exception was towards the end and after we finally learn about who the hell they are. There is nothing known about who they are after the plane crash that could possibly allow for emotional attachment.My one other complaint was towards the crash itself. First of all, the crashing/landing scene looked terrible and looked like it was slapped together overnight. Besides that, when the plane crashes, Ottway is found hundreds of feet away from the wreck. Is that even possible? How did he get flung all the way across a snow bank so far away? Not only that, everyone who survived sustained minor injuries which made me question if they were in a plane crash bicycle accident. Even if Ottway managed to land so far away from the plane, one would think he would have larger injuries...Although many things affected this movie negatively, I can still pull out some positives. The scenery and shots were really good, the acting was way better towards the end, and the dialogue was descent (not the poem, that was cheesy). The guys during the campfires talked about each others lives, which helped the movie a lot. It actually made me feel sorry for the last couple of deaths.If the movie cut out the garbage such as sudden volume changes that don't even startle you, just tick you off, it would be much more enjoyable. The characters developed too late into the movie, and the story only picked up after half the guys were dead.",The Grey

Say what!? The barrel, action, trigger assembly, hell, even the scope are intact, it is 100% usable, even if you are such a sissy that you can't fire it like a pistol, he could tie or tape or otherwise attach the butt with a few minutes work.Then he finds what? Shotgun shells. Shotgun? Really? With a light barrel like that? I mean, the writers obviously know nothing about wolves, and the characters in the movie don't either, you could ignore that and think, ""hey, it's just a movie, the monster does what it does"", but I think most people can figure out without much research that a rifle can shoot without a butt.

Neeson is a wolf expert who keeps men alive as wolfs sometimes try to attack them as they're working. On the Trip home the plane crashes and those who survive are now at the mercy of 200lb. Timberwolves who kill just for the thrill of it. and so the battle for survival begins as the men plot a plan to start killing the Wolves before they are all killed, no to mention the weather is unbearably cold and violent.

I literally cannot begin to explain how ridiculous the ending is, the main character randomly spends ages in the cold pointlessly looking at pictures wasting energy. Then wolves appear and he happens to be in their den. One minute wolves are scared of fire the next they aren't, there was even a bit where the main character jumped into a near freezing river and stayed in it for ages trying to save one of his friends, in real life he most certainly would have developed hyperthermia but he managed to get out of the river and not even look the slightest bit cold, no shivering, NOTHING. Seriously a terrible film, i can't begin to imagine how they spent 25 million on this. I'm am not joking when i say i know people who could make much better films with a budget of 5K.

642,lewis-mack,"Unrealistic, but enjoyable",6,4 February 2013,"First and foremost, the plot certainly isn't this films strong point. It has many flaws, more than your average film but I still managed to enjoy it. The reality of the film is certainly an issue and many many people will be enraged by the unlikely actions of the wolves. I myself don't know much about the animals but even I knew some of the things the did were just absurd. Neeson saves this film, his performance is out-standing and it's amazing to see him actually resurrect his career even at his age. I found the scenes when the survivors just spoke to be decent but you never really connect with any of them, the one person I was slightly sad to see die was Talget (the guy with the glasses) but that may just be because he imagined his daughter before he died which really plucked my heart strings.The opening was really moving also, it was possibly my favourite part, that and when Neeson first says ""Once more into the fray... Into the last good fight I'll ever know. Live and die on this day... Live and die on this day...""If you aren't to nit picky at the delusional plot you should enjoy this film, the scenery is beautiful and the music is just absolutely outstanding, Marc Streitenfeld really does an amazing job. The ending is really hit or miss, personally I enjoyed it I think leaving consumer to have there own conclusion was a nice touch. This film has a lot of bad flaws but there are definitely some great scenes that will move you it certainly doesn't deserve anything less than a 4 but the music and Neeson's performance have persuaded me into a 6/10.",The Grey
643,dr-h-noguchi,Good Horror but Not a Wolf Film,8,26 March 2013,"An airplane loaded with roughneck oilmen crashes in Alaska and the survivors trek through a snow storm to survive while a pack of wolves kill them off one by one.Some reviewers loved it. Some hated it. Those who loved it saw a competently directed action horror film in a realistic setting filled with real people facing real threats. Those who hated it saw an unrealistic depiction of wildlife behavior and unworkable outdoor skills. People who loved it thought the movie was realistic. People who hated it thought it was ridiculous.Without giving away the story, let me tell you that this is not a story about actual wolf behavior. This is more like the numerous movies of the produced through the '70s, '80s and '90s about a group of people picked off one by one by unseen creatures lurking in the dark. In the '70s, they were natural animals like sharks, killer whales, reptiles, furry animals and insects. In the '80s they were space aliens and robots. In the '90s they were super assassins. Lately they are vampires and zombies. Now we are back to furry animals. But the overall theme is the same.It is refreshing to see this theme played out in the Alaskan wilderness rather than on a space ship or an underground city overrun by zombies. In that sense, this movie is realistic. But the furry animals in the movie behave more like space aliens than actual wolves. The ""expert hunter"" in the movie is not actually giving you wisdom that will be useful in the Alaskan wilderness. He is more of a generic zombie hunter. In that sense, this movie is unrealistic.So whether you like this movie or not depends entirely on what you are in the mood to see. If you want Discovery Channel, look elsewhere. If you want to see good acting in a scenic backdrop with lots of scary moments, you will like this movie. You don't have to really check in your brain at the door. Like so many Ridley Scott movies, this one is also a meditation on the nature of fate. This movie is a good piece of fiction. Just a bad documentary.",The Grey

Many things have been changed but no one can change the phenomena of death is still there that haunt the human even today.the movie was awesome . It kept me an edge throughout the movie and Liam Neeson at his best next to taken but he done a amazing job and is a movie worth watching.Liam did a great job and kept the pace of his acting. if you like a good suspense movie this is one to see. it will leave you on edge all the way to the end.The movie is great and plot also.

645,JohnZMG52,Unique but Lacking,5,26 October 2013,"Okay starts out with cliché airplane survivor beginning so I'm thinking this will probably be a tedious descent into nothing kind of like Outpost 11.But when I came in with my dad there was some guy who was decked out in total tundra survival outfit I mean ski pole goggles 2-ton backpack and a sweater that made him look like he just spent 2 hours at a all you can eat buffet who looked at me and said ""This is the best movie ever I've watched it 7 times"" so I thought ""Okay this guy likes it enough for him to look like he's ready for one of those climate apocalypse movies"". Having Liam Neeson be the main character already told me this is going to be a hardcore movies and as for acting he did well in his role as a social outcast who turned to protecting oil workers from unrealistic wolf attacks who also I think had a family(watched it a long time ago). The storyline seemed predictable just to have that ending that you never saw coming. I'm going off track anyway to add on to it the survivors are being picked off one by one by wolves which is very rare unless they're starving and the one survivor who gets up without his arm fractured is guess what... A wolf expert and hunter, but yet he still thinks it's a good idea to go into the woods where the wolves are totally not caring for their young. So the survivors decide to take the journey to the woods, so then there's this chase scene where the wolves are either to lazy or too drunk to be able to catch up to wounded survivors wading through the snow. The chase scene ends when the wolves stop at the wood I'm like ""What is this Snow White! Are the wolves afraid of the woods they've been living in for the oh 40 years"" the few survivors make a campfire with a billion little Efing eyes just piercing your soul before there's a scene where they make torches that do absolutely nothing to fend off the wolves. The proof: an Omega wolf- Lowest of wolves attacks them and ends up as dinner apparently ""tasting like s**t"" and the rest of the movie is them running deeper into the woods trying to survive. The ending although kicks away the Hero turns out to be alive cliché but instead turns out that the group was heading towards the den the whole time and Liam and Alpha face off where Liam makes some pretty bad ass wolverine claws by using bottles and cracking them and the movie ends with both jumping at each other. My dad and I were about to leave before Mr.Santa told us to wait after the credits and we did it shows both alpha wolf pack leader and Liam 9/10 dead with his finishing action being looking at the picture of his family which was really sad and kept me that way for the next week. The movie was enjoyable with it's jump scares and savage beasts but also depressing knowing that there was no other ending but it's downside is wolves never act like that unless they have rabies. Overall it was a movie that I was pleased with and I spent some quality time with my dad (for once he got scared) (oh and the birth year not sure if being 17 and under restricts me for reviewing R rated movies)",The Grey

647,selwocm,Totally Unbelievable,4,18 March 2015,"Some go to movies for the intent of watching science fiction, a good, sad love story, blood and guts and for these reasons, some movies are not really intended to be too authentic. The Grey on the other hand is a poor attempt at trying to tell a believable story of what would happen should a plane crash in a remote spot in Alaska with a passenger list of some pretty tough bad arses that work in a harsh environment. Good story at least it could have been! There are so many unbelievable parts of this movie, that it simply becomes annoying to watch. If Ebert supposedly left the movie it is not because he was too overwhelmed by the scope of the movie it most likely is because he found that this footage was simply too silly to bear any longer. With my (admittedly) limited knowledge of the circumstances: 1. Any airplane would have a GPS device that would certainly pick up a downed aircraft. 2. As soon as the airplane did give a call out or GPS sounding, the alert would have gone out and there would have been many, many search and rescue attempts, not just the ""Company"" which was stated from one of the survivors! Was this aircraft due somewhere to land!? Did anyone check to see that there was an arrival time and if it did arrive!? Wives, girlfriends, grandmothers, kin folk!!! What!!! the plane is gone no one cares!!! These guys were tough to the core harden workers used to working in difficult situations. They got on the plane all wearing the big heavy coats and just sat right down, spilling out some pretty lame and stupid dialog to ease the pain! So, the plane crashes and most are killed and a few survive with various injuries. Yes, some pretty believable and touching death scenes occur, but the wolf stalking is totally silly even when hunger would drive them on! While each one of the survivors ""Gets it"" for various reasons, they all remain on the frozen ground for a day or two while freezing temperatures threaten those huddled in and about the plane. Then they decide to pick up wallets and proceed to turn the limp, bodies over while the hands and limbs are trashing about! Later, the few survivors are seen wearing light gear and almost no head or face protection as they head off though a below zero- Howling - blizzard! Ten minutes of this and the lungs would freeze, your nose would fall off, along with your fingers and toes! One of the worse examples of film making is when Liam Neeson jumps into a freezing river to save a friend. First off, he would last about one minute before succumbing to hypothermia and then even if he were to survive the freezing water, it is so incredibly stupid to believe that he would survive out on the hillside with his wet, dripping clothes in freezing, snowing weather! But instead, off he goes now alone to defy the wolves, the environment and loneliness! Totally, pure trash to believe this silly story! Fantasy - o.k. But don't try to make it seem real to anyone with a brain.",The Grey
648,carlatkinson75,Complete load of rubbish,1,6 April 2014,The worst film I have seen for a very long time. The plot was ridiculous with killer wolves chasing stupid guys who could have protected themselves around the wreckage or with weapons but decided to walk about the forest hoping to get killed by alien wolves that were the size of lions. Biologists and conservationists who take an interest in wolves must be shaking their heads as much as the shark brigade would have been in the 70s. Jaws although complete fiction was a good film whilst this is terrible. I would rather watch the adverts then this trash! This is so bad! I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life I'll never get back. And the ending..what can I say...it's so stupid that I don't think I have ever seen a more sillier ending.

649,whapah87,Just not my kind of movie,5,2 February 2012,"The Grey was a movie that just simply did not do it for me. The strange thing about it is that I actually consider it to be a good ""film"". Liam Neeson is excellent as usual, and the plot had some very important and unique metaphors woven in, with what is a pretty solid survival action flick. My problem with the movie is the atmosphere, or more simply put, the feeling I got when I watched it. I still remember people telling me about how they hated Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, and trying to understand when they'd tell me, ""The movie was good! But I hated it, it made me feel sick."". Thats exactly what this movie did to me, and it could be because of the unnecessarily graphic and emotional scene of a man dying in the plane, or cheesy overemotional flashbacks. This movie simply didn't mesh with my DNA. I try and write reviews based on a movies merits and try and keep them as subjective as possible, but I couldn't help myself with this one. Bottom line is, if your a casual movie goer who just wants a good old-fashioned thriller with very solid action than this movie is for you. However, if you a movie lover who enjoys movies on a visceral level, as well as an intellectual/entertainment level (or perhaps your a bit squeamish :P) then I'd say stay away and get a restraining order.",The Grey

This film is extremely divisive, either you will love this movie or hate it. However, in my opinion this is one of the best films in cinematic history. The emotional drama between Liam Neeson contemplating life and death, as well as his ability to convey himself without much dialogue is not only moving, but also compelling. The Grey is beyond emotionally draining, which will turn some viewers off, but the strong storytelling and message behind this film is something that more films need. The soundtrack is also superb as it adds emotion to already emotional scenes. This film should be rated higher, and it is a cinematic masterpiece.",The Grey

655,tmnyland,"Masterful, Misunderstood Art",10,18 April 2020,"The Grey is one of the best films I've ever seen. Unfortunately, it's also criminally misunderstood.It's not about wolves or their behavior. It's not about how to survive in the wilderness, nor the skills necessary to do so. Anyone experienced with the aforementioned will find it unaccurate and unrealistic. I know I did the first time watching it. But, again - it's not about that.The Grey is about our need for purpose. It's about redemption, comradery, meaning, morale and pure instinct clashing with raw emotion. It's about faith and willpower, and the miraculous ways in which any situation can feel both easy and impossible. It's about the relationship between physical and mental progress.The Grey is multi-layered to a point far beyond most films. The men's journey through unforgiving nature, fighting unyielding challenges, sees them grow and develop in both heartwarming and heartbreaking ways. The plot is clear and far from convoluted, yet there's a vast amount of poetry between the lines to sink your teeth into. Cinematografy is beautiful. Acting is fantastic.The Grey is not a movie about survival in its most literal form, but survival in a much broader sense. No matter the world, context, or challenges one may face. Whether it be in endless frozen woods, or amidst the ever-expanding civilation. Survival, in its most poetic yet simplistic form.Watch it.",The Grey

However, the plot was so unrealistic that it made it impossible for me to suspend disbelief. If you are going to make a movie that (according to some reviewers) is an existential examination of the meaning of life, then make sure your plot doesn't insult the intelligence of your audience. All movies require us to suspend disbelief and this is easy to do when we know what film we are in - Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, The Avengers etc makes it easy because we know we are in a genre that is fantasy. The Grey lost me because it failed to understand this point. I can live with Harry Potter doing magical things, Batman doing superhuman things.... But Otway, the apparent expert on wolves and survival in the sub-Arctic wilderness, doing stupid things? No credibility.

In life you dont really need wolves to bring you down to your knees, life itself will do that and trust me there are many ways this can happen.
Humans can be a lot more vicious""wolves"" to each other, we can be those wolves ourselves, its not hard to be your own worst enemy.
Its about obstacles in life, regret, grievance, forgiveness, the never ending loop of self destruction, memories and pain, that hole my friends can be deep and it can go a lot deeper as we age.
Eventually everybody loses in life, we lose friends as we get older, the people we love, the opportunities dry up, sometimes you dont get a second chance and you have to live with your decisions for the rest of your life.
This is why the scene with Diaz hits so hard.
In those last moments, watching the nature in peace, breathing and just Diaz being himself was enough to accept he was always good enough of a human being , life itself can be beautiful even when surrounded with total despair and darkness.I could go on and on about how deep this movie actually is.

The illusion breaks up, leaving behind only error spotting. And there is much to spot! In the beginning, the implausibility of the whole film takes most attention. Towards the end, incredible klaff errors jump in. Sometimes there is snow to the knee, then no snow at all in the next act, even though both acts happen in the same place at almost the same time. The characters follow a river whose width varies randomly from act to act. And so on.Another annoying thing about ""The Grey"" is that the ""hero"" is in fact a baddie. John Ottway (starring Liam Neeson) is a hunter who claims to know how to survive in the wilderness. The others trust him, which is a big mistake. Almost everything Ottway says is witless, and his decisions have catastrophic consequences. Still, the movie keeps on presenting Ottway as a hero, and the others keep on following him like rats followed the piper. The unintended lesson of the story is hence: ""Do not believe everyone who claims to be an expert.""I wonder how this crap has got so many good reviews.

This reminded me of the John Travolta Movie ""Ladder 49"" where he dies too. We don't want reality in a movie, we want to escape it. And if you rail against movies like Mission Impossible with the special effects that's entertainment folks. If you disagree with me and like sad/tragic endings don't watch movies and instead flip on the TV news and that should take care of your needs and a whole lot cheaper too.

I was expecting a fairly predictable and somewhat cliché survival flick and it was probably only out of respect and admiration for Liam Neeson that I paid to watch it at the big screen. It was a decision that was well and truly vindicated. The film has an incredible presence and atmosphere it was almost spiritual. So much of what you see is symbolic and metaphoric and it reaches you on a much deeper level. In many respects this film is less about survival and more about accepting and embracing our own mortality. Some of the most poignant and haunting scenes are generated from a subtle facial expression or the wind howling in the background. Just a beautifully shot film filled with raw emotional energy with so many subtle subplots and character exploration which becomes so engrossing its almost addictive. My biggest piece of advice would be to go in to this film open minded and try to engage the philosophic undertones throughout and you will surely find the experience riveting",The Grey

WOLVES DO NOT ATTACK LIKE THEIR POSSESSED BY DEMONS!! and intentionally and strategically start killing the humans off 1 by 1.

Statistically you are more likely to be killed by a deer! I mean if they would have said the wolves were infected by some sort of zombie like virus then I would have enjoyed the film a lot more. But I am not an idiot and not a sheep. The movie industry CANNOT FEED ME THIS CRAP and expect me to shove my face full of popcorn and smile and watch it. No Not happening.

We must cross it to avoid the wolves. What happens? Someone falls and dies and gets eaten by wolves. I thought they were crossing the cliff to avoid wolves? Why were there wolves waiting at the bottom. Oh a wolf comes flying out the darkness and boom there goes another person. Oh whats that? someone is now sick. So he dies. Oh Crud.. Almost EVERY single decision Liam Neeson makes is BAD and results in another member of the group being killed off. This is how the movie goes. Plane crashes they try and scamper for wood for fire and food to eat. Before you know it wolves start attacking and people die. They try to flee to the woods for protection, then another guy dies. They make it in the woods. They get attacked again by wolves. Someone gets sick and dies. They try to cross a cliff and someone falls and gets eaten by wolves. Then as they keep travelling through the woods and another guy gets attacked. Liam Neeson has a moment of breakdown and calls for the help of GOD and says ""Do something!!"" and continues to ask for gods help. Nothing happens. Liam Neeson says ""F--- It Ill do it myself!""

But that aside I was surprised how much I enjoyed The Grey. It was beautifully shot - e.g. lovely creative use of focus on snow falling in places - and moved along at a good pace, but mostly because it was such a reflective film for a Hollywood 'action flick'. There was actually some character development, at least in the lead part, and Liam Neeson's performance is absolutely blinding - possibly the best I've seen him.Someone else pointed out the whole thing is an allegory for life, an appealing idea which does make some sense, and the existential hints present from the outset gave it a far less brainless hedonistic feel than most 'action flicks'. In short recommended, the director and team should be proud.",The Grey

671,ridge314,Dumbest Movie I've Ever Seen,1,3 December 2012,"Literally every scene in this movie could be criticized. The reviews above have hit plenty of them so I'll add in some I haven't seen mentioned and even then there will be more howlers not yet mentioned, this movie is that gawd-awful.For starters the plane never takes off, seriously (neither does the film). The guy sitting next to Liam changes seats and the plane is clearly parked at the terminal. The camera cuts to the other side of the plane with no break in continuity and the airframe is shuddering and shaking (why? Planes in heavy turbulence don't react like this) and guys are talking about assuming crash positions. Ridiculous!We see sparks erupting from control panels in the cockpit. Why? Why would these systems be shorting out? Liam buckles himself in with 3 seat belts then we find him waking up completely alone in the snow, hundreds of feet from the fuselage. He is completely uninjured, as is everyone else who isn't dead (not counting the guy who dies while Liam is talking to him). The fuselage damage and the debris field are idiotic. What caused this plane to crash? WTF kind of plane crash was this that 7 people are completely uninjured and everyone else is stone cold dead? No minor injuries, no major injuries, only fatal injuries.The survivors are pretty cavalier about getting and keeping appropriate clothing on - absolutely stupid. Liam's clothing layers change from scene to scene during the ordeal. When he finally gets around to putting on a coat he tugs on a big blue down jacket, and in the very next scene is wearing a beige jacket.Storm winds howl ferociously, one second later characters are able to talk in normal voices, one second later back to howling storm winds.Those ""wolf"" special effects at night - yeecccch! Looks like my 5 year old nephew got tasked to this and came up with the idea of using tiny flashlights in pairs to evoke wolves.Altitude hypoxia is never seen below 8000 ft. Based on the terrains and landscapes shown these guys are nowhere near 8000 ft in elevation.The scene at the cliff is as bad as everyone says it is. Utterly illogical, on so many levels. They find a single tree stump and rejoice as this is evidence of logging activity. ROFLMAO in the midst of a roadless, trackless wilderness a logging company came and cut down a single tree. Yeah, right. When the guy makes the ridiculous jump across the chasm into a tree (btw they brought a seat belt from the plane for just this reason - give me a break already) we clearly see him descending - as gravity compels him to - yet the makeshift rope he attaches is at exactly the height as the cliff he jumped off. In knee deep snow these guys never walk single file, always they are spread out with each guy struggling to break his own trail. Yet when a wolf appears they can instantly sprint through the exact same snow.The river they follow downstream constantly gets smaller till it is just a small creek. It should be frozen over, yet no ice is visible anywhere.You cannot easily build and maintain a fire in a snowfield. The heat causes your fire to very quickly sink down into a hole. Yet these guys keep several going for hours.The list could go on and on. This was a very dumb movie. Do not waste money or time on it.",The Grey

The movie was very slow at times and kept you waiting for something to happen. There were times I kept thinking it was going to turn around but it just never happened. As for the ending...it was very disappointing to sit through two hours and not have one person make it out alive. At the end of the movie in a theater that was packed...you could have heard a pin drop. The only noise were comments of you've got to be kidding... Not good at all.

674,FrozenInferno,Very boring,6,8 May 2015,"Surprised so many people like this movie. I was bored to bits throughout the entire viewing. After the first guy dies, everything becomes completely predictable and follows a very flat narrative trajectory. Some people claim they were really all dead from the beginning and the wolves actually symbolized one thing or another.

675,brad_c-1,Implausible!,2,11 February 2012,"I had to give this only 2 out of 10. If I had written this directly after viewing this movie than I would have given it 0 out of 10. I was disappointed and it may somewhat be my own fault. I'm not sure I really saw an entire trailer for this film so I was expecting something more. I was expecting a well done film on a man's survival against nature. Instead what it turned out to be was man's survival against some fictitious animals that are supposed to be wolves. I didn't expect something in the genre of ""Deep Blue Sea"" except instead of sharks it was wolves. The director started out so strong with some great perspectives and interesting visuals. But as soon as the first wolf was introduced I new something was off about this film. The portrayal of the wolves was so unrealistic that they had to resort to using obvious CG throughout the whole film and no real wolves. The only thing that kept me in my seat was thinking, early on, that there would be some creative twist in the writing at the end. (Like some ""Life of Pi"" thing were the wolves represented something else and didn't really exist.) Or anything that would make the fantasy- like creation of these wolves seem more plausible. It ended even worst than I expected.If this is the genre of film you are expecting to see than yes it is well done in comparison. But why? This film could have been so much better without the hokey characterization of the wolves. Maybe having Liam Neeson and Dermot Mulroney star in this film is what threw me off.",The Grey
676,blobblob32,Too many glaring mistakes to suspend disbelief,3,19 February 2012,"I like Liam Nesson and admire his steadfastness to two word film titles, but this was ridiculous. I don't think I'm spoiling anything by pointing out that just prior to the plan crash, all of a sudden everyone's breath is visible and the stewardess is walking around in short sleeves. How can no one be cold yet their breath is vaporizing? And why would the plane all of a sudden get ice on its wings at cruising altitude? It just doesn't happen in mid flight. After the crash it is really cold. Liam is shaking: ice and snow have already accumulated on the fuselage (it look less than two minutes for the plane to get covered): it's super duper cold there. And yet everyone walks around with their jackets unzipped to mid chest and they don't have their hoods on either?! (Wow how lucky were they to find jackets, gloves and hats relatively undamaged by the crash). This is nonsenseFinally in the -20F weather, they somehow survive the first night with just a small fire going (basically to keep the wolves away and the guys on watch warm(?), and yet the next morning when they are gathering wallets to identify all of the victims of the crash, the bodies are still supple. That is the arms flop when they turn them over. Firstly rigor would have stiffen the bodies by then if they hadn't frozen solid first! That's just the first 10 minutes!Come on guys, if you want me to buy into the premise, don't take short cuts or assume I'm an idiot.

677,alexsmom-1,Thought-provoking and philosophical,8,29 October 2012,"John Ottoway (Liam Neeson), an atheist, leads a small group of plane crash survivors in a quest for survival, as one by one, the elements take them. Lots to like here: Liam Neeson's acting, well directed. Great visuals. Very effective philosophical theme. I normally don't like movies where the hero dies... although the 2nd ending leaves that option open. As a Christian, I do not espouse existentialism: [""a modern philosophical movement stressing the importance of personal experience and responsibility and the demands that they make on the individual, who is seen as a free agent in a deterministic and seemingly meaningless universe.""] But, don't we all struggle with the meaning of life? And don't all Christians wonder at times, where is God? Why doesn't he/she intervene here? Can I REALLY count on God or just ""do it myself."" Many reviews quote the poem as the main theme of the movie: ""Once more into the fray Into the last good fight I'll ever know Live and die on this day Live and die on this day"" But I feel the theme of the movie was best stated in Ottoway's desperate prayer near the end of the film: Ottoway yelling at God: ""Do something ! Do something! You phony prick fraudulent m-f-r. Do something! Come on! Prove it! F... faith! Earn it! Show me something real! I need it now. Not later. Now! Show me and I'll believe in you until the day I die. I swear. I'm calling on you. I'm calling on you! F... it. I'll do it myself."" Even atheists have a sense that there is a God. This movie bravely wrestles with the frustration that we humans feel... then why don't you help? Why don't you do something? To stand back and ignore suffering, you would have to be a ""phony M-F-r"". It's honest. The very end, after the credits, leaves some hope that the hero survived. That begs the question: if he IS spared, was it his own doing, or a miracle from God? Isn't that how life is? When God does answer prayer, we often fail to recognize divine intervention. We credit ""luck"", ""fate"" or take the credit ourselves.",The Grey
678,theshmf,The sad majority completely missed the point of this film.,7,27 September 2012,"Newsflash to the shallow armchair hacks on IMDb: This film was a giant metaphor and wasn't supposed to be a realistic story!! FFS people, the metaphors aren't even that subtle, which is a big reason why this film was able to secure a solid budget & cast one of the best actors in the world ... because it is a decent 'crossover' film between independent artistic films and the bluntly obvious cliché Hollywood action movies. There is a reason that the Scott brothers got behind this film's production.Yes, the animal effects were poorly done in many scenes. If that's really all you care about when you watch a film then you really shouldn't be reviewing them.No, the lack of realism is not really relevant.""The Grey"" is largely a metaphorical term, very commonly used when people refer to something being ""in a gray area"". It is based on a short story which tries to use a specific scenario to depict the agnostic's state of mind & how people of different beliefs face the inevitability of death during their final seconds. (A lot of people are claiming this as an atheist film attempting to argue that there is no God ... those people are just flat out wrong) The poem that is constantly repeated is the hardest part for people to 'place'. I interpreted it as the overriding theme of the story: life is a series of battles in a war of questions, but we are all going to face death at some point, and accepting that you will die without any answers is the greatest battle of them all.The film clearly has its flaws. The supporting cast was poorly cast & were characterized to far too cliché extremes. And as mentioned (too often), the wolf effects were bad to the point that they almost should have been edited out as they provided negligible substance to make up for the lack of realism.However, much of the rest of the film's directing & acting was superb ... as was the material, pacing, score, imagery, & scenery. For fans of film as an art form this will be a good watch, not a great one, but the attempt to bring intelligent thought-provoking artistry back to the mainstream is laudable in itself.",The Grey
679,zmckrell1324,Other reviewers seem to be missing some things,10,28 January 2012,"I went into this movie with relatively low hopes, expecting to see a more than slightly dumb hour and a half of blind action. I came out blown away. This film is not an action movie so I can't blame some people for not liking it if that's what they expected. It is an actually deep film. One of the major story points is about religion which is what some of the men turn to in the Alaskan wilderness. Another major part is the background of Liam Neeson's character, which is never fully known. The writer does a great job of giving you the perfect amount of knowledge on the character so that you can care about him and at the same time gives you as little information as possible so as to maintain a certain ambiguity on the character. For me these are the two things that make the movie and I'll be sure to see it again because of that.",The Grey
680,hliriani,"Enough of the Survivalist Debate, Let's Talk About a Story",10,5 June 2012,"Of all of the negative reviews I've read thus far, the most consistently mentioned critiques deal with the movie's realism. I find it really difficult to believe that any such inaccuracies portrayed in the movie get so far in the way of the delivery of its message. Nothing about it is particularly unbelievable. But, I guess if you watched the movie thinking you were going to get survival tips for your North Pole backpacking trip, it's your own fault that you were disappointed. Ottway never claims that he is a survival expert (a proclamation of that kind would be pretty foolish coming from anybody). Thus, the actions they take are very much fear– driven reactions to imminently life–threatening predators and climate conditions. The sort of ""moral"" expectations placed on the men by reviewers seems ludicrous. If you consider the likely lifespans of the men from the plane crash and on, they would be spending an unreasonably large chunk of that time depressed if all they did was mourn ""adequately"" over their fallen brothers. This happens in plenty of other movies in which members of a group die. They don't stay mournful the whole time. They have to spend a good bit of that time pumping themselves up, because they could be the next to die at any moment. Regardless, think a lot of extremely superficial discussion over survivalist accuracy is getting in the way of what is a much bigger picture: Carahan's storytelling. The movie chiefly deals with the split–second metaphysical pondering on life as the group of surviving men face their deaths. It's all about the poem written by Ottway's father.Carahan shows us the scene of Ottway's presumed lover and leaves quite a bit of it up to interpretation until the last few moments, when the repeated scene of the two in bed is extended to include a view of the IV drip, implying that his lover had ""left"" him through death, an assumption that wouldn't seem initially obvious because of how heavily John Ottway implicates himself from the beginning. Her telling him to not be afraid was in regard to her imminent death, a message that Ottway obviously applied to his final ""fight.""The Grey implies that the ""fight"" is a microcosm of life itself: fighting for something / someone, or even fighting to find something to live for. Even if the behavior of the wolves wasn't realistic, or if it was only possible to survive -5º weather rather than –6º, these are fill–in–the–blank scenarios to impose trials on the characters. Frankly, I found these scenarios believably myself, and felt as though the characters' responses felt natural most of the time.This movie was a really beautiful story about the enduring will of mankind in a doomed situation, and the importance of the ""fight,"" or what is another words, the catalyst for Ottway's radical swing from suicide to surviving till the bitter end.",The Grey

The story was weak, the characters were shallow and stereotypical, the acting was terrible, the plot was weak, boring and predictable, not in the least bit thrilling or interesting, the portrayal of the wolves was tremendously inaccurate, disgustingly so....and worse, they were very obviously fake wolves throughout, excepting a few very blurry shots where they were moving naturally but were obviously much smaller and thinner than the wolves that attacked the men.

Agreed, if you take it from that perspective, and I think that's the failure of the editing in this film, If you take a philosophical view of the movie, and apply some creative imagination, the film has some merit. Lets say that all the men actually died in the crash. Lets say that the rest of the movie is just the last dreaming thoughts of Liam's character as he dies. Ah, there, it all makes sense - everyone dies, there's no point to the struggle of life, but its in our nature to struggle to survive.Think of it this way: all the wolves in the movie (after the plane crash) are ethereal in their appearance. Either the budget was so low that crappy CGI was all they could afford, or there was some intent to portray the super natural aspect of hunter-vs-hunter in ""another world"".Since the movie's editing didn't *really* make the intention clear, it falls short, and rates a 4.",The Grey

I should've paid more attention to the handful of negative reviews out there.WARNING: SPOILERS.I simply do not understand how anyone could be a fan of this flick. For starters, it is intellectually disingenuous--much like /Jurassic Park/ with its endowing dumb dinos with superior group-think while continually robbing human beings of basic common sense just to keep the plot going/blood flowing. Folks, wolves simply DO NOT act like they do in this movie. I am not PETA, Greenpeace, or Sierra Club. I just think it's dumb to make wolves act like WEREwolves. Solitary wolves do not charge groups of men who are not threatening them or their young (an opening sequence), nor do they have the type of collective intelligence these wolves had.Second, MEN aren't that stupid. Seriously, multiple knives in the bunch, and no one thinks to sharpen some sticks and use them as spears? Neeson's character tapes broken mini-bar bottles to his knuckles, but to that point hasn't thought to tape a knife to a spear to give himself an advantage? And this guy was paid to kill wolves and is an expert about their behavior? Perhaps this wasn't Alaska--perhaps it was a parallel universe where wolves are smarter than people, aren't afraid of fire, and can fly over raging rivers and deep gorges with invisible wings to pursue their prey. EVERYTHING about the movie--costuming, scenery, effects, staging, cinematography--is believable and enjoyable. The plot and the dialogue are not.Finally, it seems like the entire pointless ""adventure"" was contrived just so Neesom's guy could quote the tagline of the whole as he faced certain death. Tip: You cannot make the case the entire movie that everything is pointless, there is no God, and after death there is nothing, then try and convince us how poignant it is that these men die alone.

But the wolves are obvious symbols of death. They are obvious, in the fact that the wolves of the main part of the movie are much different then the wolf he shoots in the beginning. The wolves of the main story are gigantic, supernatural in a way... and behaving without normal animal behavior. They are obvious metaphors for something else... and as the story rolls along they are the symbols of Death.It was a very emotional movie, starting with a near suicide - prevented by the howl of a wolf... and then the accident. To me it was a story more similar to Jacob's Ladder. In one killing we see how the wolf appears to one victim, as the man's dead daughter welcoming him, but the others see it as a terrible wolf attack.I saw the movie as the men were already dead in the crash... and the wolves were symbols of the last step to cross over. That last step is scary. It's terrifying. But that's only the fear of loss. There is really rest, and it's the loved ones who are coming to take the individuals through the process... which is why the main character of Liam is taken by the Alpha wolf... and none of the others. Possibly his wife, or father, come to help him move over.He just couldn't see it... so he saw the wolves as icons of the end, of enemies.The wolves wanted him to learn to live life, and face death fighting (not giving up) - just like the poem he often quoted throughout the movie... which is why they stopped the suicide... and yet, they brought him to the end.",The Grey

Yes, real wolves act nothing like this. Yes, maybe there's a bit of embellishment with regards to how best to behave after crash landing in the frozen north. But guess what? This is a film. Fiction. It's designed to entertain you. Not inform you. Given the choice between watching a movie where people huddle in a airplane carcass, no wolves appear and nothing really happens and watching one where people punch wolves in the face and Liam Neeson is a badass again, I know which one I'd choose.So instead of concentrating on the flaws in this film, concentrate on what's actually supposed to be concentrated on. Like the ever present terror of a deadly wolf attack (shown early on to not be a pleasant experience). Focus on the fact that you've crashed in the middle of nowhere with people you don't personally know and have every single one of them picked off, one after another. Focus on the blows to your morale when that happens and you are getting increasingly lonelier. The crushing emptiness that is the place you've crashed in. The hopelessness of your situation (yes, this is manufactured by the plot/handwaved away but if it weren't, there would be no movie). The glimmers of occasional hope, but they never pan out. Yes, the ending is a bit of a let-down, but it's left ambiguous on purpose. Is there hope left? It's up to you to decide.Immerse yourself in this film. See the events through Liam Neesons eyes.

I know there has been criticism that wolves don't hunt humans and a few other issues that may require the suspension of disbelief. But it is more important to pay attention to the inner conflict than the external conflict. The external conflict is like wood feeding the fire inside. The wolves are merely symbolic. And Liam's performance is subtle enough to be nothing short of brilliant. The film was well shot and well acted. The cinematography is effective without being distracting. One of the best films in a long time. Make sure to catch this one.,The Grey
694,brodieadamson-953-15404,Intense,8,17 November 2012,"The reviews seem to be quite mixed, lots of high and lots of lows. I'm gonna cast my hat with the high reviews. Sure, there is unrealistic bits: walking in a blizzard, surviving a plane crash, behavior of the wolves. I usually am quite critical of such unrealistic elements, but for some reason it worked for me in this movie. I didn't feel like my intelligent was being insulted like so often with Hollywood.I agree with the ""lhhung_himself"", this is a pretty deep allegory. Man v. himself, more than Man v. nature. I think this is where a lot of people giving it a low reviewed just missed the point. Its not so much about the wolves v. the people, its more about the futility of our actions in life, and that how we die is more important than when we die, or how long we live for. For me it was powerful.Unfortunately, it seems most people have been ruined by Hollywood movies. They want to see robots fighting or vampires in love. I'm sure if the pace was faster and they managed to kill the wolves, people would have reviewed this better.I recommend watching it with an open mind, and actually think about what the director/writer are trying to say here.",The Grey
695,johannes_sorensen,What's up with all the hate?,9,6 April 2012,"I saw this movie the other day, and I absolutely loved it. The best and most exciting thriller film I've seen in ages. Liam Neeson, as always, gives a strong and solid performance. He can play so many different roles, and The Grey is another example of that. He plays a man called John Ottway, one of the seven survivors who survives a plane crash in the middle of the Alaskan wilderness. Ottway's job is to keep a bunch of oil workers safe from the dangers that is lurking in the Alaska wilderness; wolves and presumably other animals. So when the plane crashes in the wilderness, they quickly discover that a pack of wolves is lurking in the shadows. They realize that they can't stay with the fuselage, and they start their march into the wilderness to find rescue.Many of the reviewers here are complaining about the wolves, that they are too big and too aggressive. And I agree. Wolves aren't that aggressive in real life, but this movie is not about the wolves. The wolves were added to make the movie entertaining and exciting, and without the wolves it probably be dull and very boring. I also find the wolves as a symbol of nature strength contra humans. Nature is so superior to human, and there are so many aspects of the nature that rises way above human.Another thing I noticed when I read some of the reviews here, is that so many complains about the ending. I really wonder why. Did you hope for a happy ending? Didn't you except all the survivors from the crash to die? Personally, I could't see another way, than to kill them all of. Think about it. A plane crashes in the middle of the Alaskan wilderness, it's freezing cold, it's snowing heavily + a wolf-pack is chasing them. How can this setting possibly have a happy ending? I'm glad they didn't spare one or two characters, because it's one of the most used clichés in the movie business when it comes to thrillers about survival. 9+/10. I will consider raising the 9 to a 10. A fantastic movie, the best survival thriller I've seen. Highly recommended!",The Grey
696,drou33,A poetic allegory not a realistic survival-type movie.,9,19 March 2012,"Many reviewers who expected a realistic survival plot from this movie have harshly and up to a degree justly criticized it for containing many unrealistic or unhinging story elements. From the implausible character decisions to the improbable behavior of wolves to the almost superhuman endurance of the characters and especially that of Neeson's to the extreme cold, the story borders the realm of a fantasy tale. But i have the belief that the director did not intent this film to be a survival-type thriller nor a man versus nature adventure. To my view this on-the-surface gloomy and depressing movie stands out as a beautiful esoteric journey of one man, John Ottway impersonated superbly by Liam Neeson, towards his final moment and redemption, when his life runs a full circle from the time he was a boy. In some metaphysical aspect this movie can also be viewed as a study of death and dying as we get to watch each survivor meet his fate. From the moment the wolf howling/calling dissuades Ottway from killing himself to the final moment of the movie when he meets face to face with the wolf -the animal he had such a strong connection with due to his professional occupation-, we get the sense that the main hero walks through a dream as he is carried by a higher force (destiny?) towards his noble end. When he shouts angrily at God to ""do something!"" only to be directed soon afterward to the wolves den, one cannot help wondering if his wish was truly granted as he was given what he subconsciously yearned for, ""one last good fight, live and die on this day"". Visually captivating, tense-packed and most importantly profound, this exceptional movie deals in essence with the difficult and unappealing subject of dying and even though many found it grim due to the sorrowful mentality of the main character i think its central message is encapsulated in the words Ottway's dying wife says to him as he recalls them in his memory, ""don't be afraid.""",The Grey
697,Coops659,Alaskan Trouble...,10,6 October 2012,"The movie was awesome. But what really made this movie better than a 5.0 rating, was Liam Neeson. His acting was superb in this movie and made the situations seem more believable. Altogether, all the actors pulled off a great show.I'm not going to lie. Some of this movie is a little far-fetched, ie; the wolf attacking the Oil Rig workers in the opening scene. And the wolves do look fake. But movies were not created to be absolutely perfect and believable in every way. The creators wanted to create a thrilling survival film about a group of people trying to survive the wilderness after a plane crash. And they succeeded. People need to stop whining about the believableness of the plot. Have they no imagination?((!SPOILER!)) And for those who dislike the ending... I don't blame you. I was a little disappointed too. But when you think about it, the ending was perfect. It displayed what people go through in life or death situations. And the transformations they go through. Ottways transformation from start to finish is incredible. And the movie should be applauded for that.Solid. 10/10",The Grey
698,die_lives,multidimensional perfection movie !!!,10,30 January 2012,"Okay, firstly, Id like to prevent you from my English, but I felt so wordless after the movie that I feel like I have to get all what I've been through this movie out of my chest at least with you guys. And I will do all what I can to best describe everything that's positive from this movie. I wish I could express myself better though, because this movie worth it.First of all, the way they introduce us to the main character right from the beginning is one of the best entrance that I've seen. From the first second, you instantly feel him and everything he feels. Its like you already know this guy from the bottom of his heart and it instantly creates a link between us, the watchers and this hero. And it'll only grow more and more as the movie goes, literally absorbing everything he says and diving in his mind.Because, yeah, secondly, the dialogues are just beautifully written. You don't feel like you're listening to some dialogues crafted and adapted to the script. You feel like every dialogues are alive as a part of the characters themselves. You feel the fear that every character feels, the anxiety, the stress, the peace, from every character and for each ones in their own ways. It has been written simply and with a touch of real humanity so it comes natural to listen carefully to what every one says and you just go along with them in every obstacles as if you were with them.Yeah, thirdly, you literally feel like you live it with them, and one other reason for that is because of the superb cameras. The way it has been filmed in close-up on every character make you catch all their facials expressions and feelings, which is very important for this movie due to the limited environment to make us feel the thriller and the panic - trees, snow and wolves ain't enough, but what we can get from all their acting at close-up is a big advantage for us to feel through them. And it's not a compensation, its a plus! Also, the way its filmed like if the cameraman was a part of them make us catch every moment, even when hes just staring at the woods during the dark ! And one of the most important that has touched me the most, is the story. Well, the main story of the surviving comes with the personal story of the hero with flashbacks which, not only gives us a a multidimensional sensations movie, but is done with full of sense and meanings and is collided so beautifully. The flashbacks make their appearance at opportune moments during the surviving thriller mixing action and drama which gives even more impact on the key scenes.Finally, this movie is complete on every aspects. You know no matter how good was a movie, sometimes you just tell yourself well ""maybe that could have been done like that, or this, I would have like if this, that."" Well not in this movie. In this one, the director has made full use of the resources he has been giving with limited environment, circumstances, obstacles, etc. that could have occurred. When you get out from the theatre, you really feel like you just lived the experience at 100% of his capacity... and it feels good.",The Grey
699,petereby99,"Based on a short story by Tommy, a grade 2 student",3,5 March 2012,"Well, we watched the movie through to the end. I was able to do that by imagining the wolves were aliens, because they seemed to be very efficient killers, totally without fear. Or maybe a tribe of psychopaths because they carry a grudge.The writer of this screenplay didn't bother to investigate the nature of wolves, perhaps he/she hasn't heard of wikipedia. In nature, wolves hunt in packs, and like soldiers, attack when they have a large numerical advantage. In this movie, they do just the opposite. Wolves hunt for food and for no other reason. Wolves in the wild are afraid of humans.In a winter survival situation, the first priority is shelter, but no, they build a big fire and sleep in the snow.And finally, where in the world do they not look for a downed passenger plane? Leaving the crash site has to be the stupidest idea ever.The acting I thought was great, especially considering the actors knew this was a stinkeroo.",The Grey
700,germaphobicmonk,One of the best movies in a long time.,8,29 January 2012,"Normally I'm not a huge fan of Liam Neeson movies, but this one doesn't disappoint. The movie starts out with a group of guys who get on a plane and say the ""F"" word with every other breath. After a while, the plane crashes and the group of men are left in the treacherous Alaska landscape. The men quickly realize though that they are not alone. They have crash landed near a pack of ravenous wolves and their den. The majority of the movie consists of them trying to evade the wolves while they get picked off one by one. The movie is epic in all things cinematic. The acting is great, the soundtrack is moving, and the CGI wolves look real. There are several ""jump"" scenes which make for an interesting viewing experience and the Alaska landscape is simply exquisite. The movie makes you wonder if you could ever get desperate enough to challenge God, the creator, and what would you do in the situation? Just like any movie though, there are some flaws. There is the clichéd ""nerd"", ""black guy"", ""hippy"", and ""mexican"" and sometimes you find yourself wondering why Liam Neeson didn't die from being bit by a wolf multiple times. All in all though, ""The Grey"" is a pleasurable viewing experience and makes one wonder how desperate you can get in certain situations. ""The Grey"" gets an 8/10 from me and I recommend you go see it. Make sure you're ready for a bloodbath, violent, and adrenaline pumping thriller though, because that's what you'll get.",The Grey
701,michielham0,suspense till the last minute,6,6 March 2012,"I liked to watch the movie, for one because Liam Neeson is playing the leading role, and again he did a good job. The Grey isn't a movie based on reality, or a true story like the movie The Way Back were also a group of men had to survive in the wilderness. if you like to see a suspense movie were people get picked of one by one like in Alien, but instead of on a spaceship the setting is Alaska and the Aliens are replaced by Wolves. The acting in the movie is good, it doesn't come over like a cheap style of movie with bad acting, the only thing thats to bad is you don't really get to see the wolves that well until far in to the movie and than only a couple of seconds. Don't get me wrong its still a good movie to watch, Ones you start the movie its easy to watch it till the end.",The Grey

Then starts the real movie where the plane crashes and are left alone in deserted region filled with snow every where. The freezing wind at one end and the angry wolves looking forward to kill these intruders who are within 300 miles of their range. The story runs with blood-shed, killings, surviving at fast pace now. Every minute will be a real suspense of whats going to happen. This movie will keep you in a place where you will be scared to get into a flight and of wolves. The voice of Liam Neeson's is haunting adding to the story. His character is amazingly portrayed on the screen. I seriously appreciate the actors for working in such a cold temperatures and keeping the story alive. You have seen many haunting movies like these but this is something different. Its definitely not a routine hero kick-back. The inspirational lines by Liam Neesons are amazing and you will be surprised by the climax. Watch it and it will haunt you till the night you sleep.",The Grey
703,margaw,a powerful movie,9,1 March 2012,"I'd like to say a few words about this movie I just watched, and relative to all the bad reviews it gets here.Lots of practical details are clearly botched, or unrealistic, whatever. But personally, when I go see a movie ( a fiction!), I don't expect to watch a wildlife documentary, neither in this case a sort of hardcore survival lesson. I really enjoyed the entire story; sometimes, the feeling you get from a movie is more important than the accuracy of things (like, ""this could NEVER happen in real life"". Well, sure, it's a MOVIE...). I felt the primal fear, I suffered with the characters, I'm not asking for anything else. The landscapes, Liam Neeson (who finally appears in a good movie again, in my opinion), the delicate but also scary soundtrack, every piece of that work... I loved it! And even if, while going out of the movie theater, I started to list all the wrong details in my head, I still can't deny I enjoyed the movie with all my heart.",The Grey
704,joshmortimer-newby,"Emotional, adrenaline pumping, entertaining and at times beautiful.",7,30 January 2012,"I went to see ""The Grey"" a couple of days ago and to be honest i didn't really know what to expect. But i can say i came out of the cinema more than happy with what i saw. ""The Grey"", will have you on a roller coaster ride of emotions and will have you entertained throughout it's duration. It's impressive sound design and editing will have your adrenaline pumping and will draw you into the dark and uncomfortable situations the characters throughout the film undergo. It's cinematography is also rather impressive at times especially when it came to capturing the beauty of the landscapes and the surrounding environment. The writing and character development at times was very good and at others not so good. For when the wolves were pushed out of the picture (which was quite often), the writing of the emotional connections between SOME of the characters was in my opinion very well done, and at times very emotional and beautiful and really got across a sense of hope and loneliness. Due to the regular neglectfulness of the subject of the man eating wolves. I personally thought the film could of focused more on the hope and loneliness of each individual survivor and each of their individual fights for a new life and for survival possibly against a different more believable threat. But obviously this wasn't the type of film the filmmakers had set out to make. For they set out to make an action/adventure/drama survival thriller, therefore as a consequence of this they also had to focus on the thriller/action part of the film. But in my opinion i believe there wasn't a very good balance between the drama side of the film and the action/thriller side of the film. For it contained stereotypical characters which are regularly found within action/thriller films which is to been expected, obviously. But the main problem i had with this film is that the threat of the man eating wolves would come and go as it pleased and when it did it would always come through the act of cheep shocks and would always leave sharply and unexpectedly. As a consequence of this i didn't find ""The Grey"" to be that scary to be honest, which i guess is kind of a negative point. Despite this though, i am rather pleased the filmmakers didn't just focus on the scares of the film and instead focused rather a lot of their attention on the development of SOME of the main characters, which i believe made the film more worthwhile, enjoyable and emotional. Overall, i believe ""The Grey"" is a very enjoyable, emotional and adrenaline pumping survival thriller/drama and in my opinion is a very impressive addition to the survival thriller category. See this film and i assure you, you won't be disappointed.",The Grey
705,vimmy2492,Horrible movie!,1,1 February 2012,"There is no purpose of the movie at all. It's obvious that when a flight crashes in such a place everyone will die. The movie doesn't show how exactly the characters feel in that situation, it's just that the wolves keep coming and kill one by one and the characters keep running away from them.Oh also, they could have just collected the metal derbies of the flight and could have covered up the opening so that the wolves won't have chance to attack them and also they would have been a lot warmer. This movie is for those who wants to die, where this movie explains you shouldn't die by yourself but you're gonna die eventually anyway. And use of the F word is countless.

The story was something I initially thought was going to be too simple to hold any real interest for very long. Boy was I mistaken. Simple, yet intricate in it's progression, I sat on the edge of my seat throughout the movie. The cast was no less than outstanding, and Liam Neeson is quickly becoming one of my all time favorite actors. Another aspect of this movie which I cannot help but mention is the cinematography. To state that the Great White North can be beautiful but deadly, is an understatement the likes of which this film strongly overcomes. From the very beginning you start to notice that the landscape is nothing less than breathtaking, and those that directed the camera shots of the surrounding area really knew how to bring out the very best of a film I thought would have an almost boring ""snow-filled"" view.

707,atp118,Horrible- Unrealistic,2,31 January 2012,"I am in utter SHOCK of the 9 and 10 ratings for this movie. I just saw this movie and thought it was HORRIBLE. I use to have so much respect for the ratings system on this website This is a complete outrage that people are giving this a 10 star. Warning- do not read if you haven't seen the film and wish not to hear major spoilers. However, continue reading if you want to save $10. Im going to start by saying, the trailer for this film totally throws the viewer off and doesn't follow up with what is promised. For all of the people that thought this was a 9 or 10, i encourage you to write me back and i challenge any of you to explain yourselves. The following is my list of events that made this movie as bad as it is.1) The movie is so unrealistic its funny. 7 people survive a plane crash in the middle of Alaska. They sleep outside for days- with little 2 foot fires they made. ARE You SERIOUS you would be dead or frozen within hours . The so called killer wolves. I've seen my fair share of animal shows- wolves kill things to eat them. Not just to kill something. All of the people killed in the movie are killed and never eaten. Here is the big one- Liam is still alive after being outside in ALASKA for three days, Blizzard like conditions, probably negative temps, a massive wolf bite to the knee and guess what he does on the third day. He jumps into an Alaskan river for 3 minutes. And walks away completely fine. After being in the Alaskan wilderness for days jumping into water that is 32 digress would give you instant hypothermia- and you would be dead in about 30 minutes.2) THe premise of the story is so bad and makes no sense. In the start of the movie we are believing that Neesen is some master wolf killer and survival expert. Guess what this expert wolf killer manages to do. He doesn't kill one frigging wolf the entire time they are out there. He convinces the remaining survivors to flee into the woods or they will die. Guess what happens- EVERYONE DIES. He didn't protect anyone let alone use any expert survival knowledge at all. He lit all the fires with the oil and matches. For all these people who say this is a ""Survival Movie at its Best"" in there reviews. Are you serious. what does he do throughout the movie that you think he is a survival expert.3) I found myself laughing out loud in the theater at some of the scenes. - Because they were so out of control and unrealistic. 1) I found it funny that the guys were gathered around a fire laughing and joking when 20 minutes earlier someone just got killed by a WOLF. 2) The guys decide there best way of survival is to get down to a river they can hear. SO they decide to jump of a CLIFF with some rope/bed sheets they miraculously found in ten seconds. Are you kidding Me. Oh yeah the last guy falls to the ground and is killed by 3 wolves waiting for him down there. Did the wolves transport down the 100 foot cliff. Some of the wolf scenes were LOL funny. They would be chasing the people and Liam would say ""RUN"" the survivors would start running in 3 feet of snow going 1 mile an hour but the wolfs never could keep up.Movie was horrible",The Grey

As I was watching the characters try to survive, a part of me felt that I was in the movie with them, hoping for salvation. The only part I didn't like is that yes, the nature of the wolves and their behavior is unrealistic, but I tried to forget about it and just enjoy the movie. If it was realistic, the movie would have ended in 30 minutes with everyone been rescued. Having the wolves behave like that provided an extra threat which made up the movie. Even though the wolves weren't realistic, the rest of the story was. The ending was really amazing in my opinion, and I can't think of a better one for this movie.

With the grit within his act, Liam Neeson is at his best to present the director's point.Liam Neeson appears to be a man in grief, for him the meaning of life is love and being deeply loved, but sometime love fade, then comes the pain, and he numb the pain by try to avoid human connection, so he lost the meaning. Long to suicide, he failed to commit it.And then, the plane crush.The crush suddenly gives him a task, a test. The survivors need his experience, and when a man is needed in such situation, we won't back off. After a Hollywood style walkthrough of wild survival struggle (it's good but the point is not stand in there), the meaning of a life disconnected from love, which seems so vague in the start, finally shapes itself. The Grey remind me of Smith in the Matrix. He would say, the meaning of life is to end. Sorry Smith, the meaning of life is up to everyone.

I expected that the tension would drop soon after that and it would be one of those expectable movies, but something else happened the constant lurking of the wolves and the chasing makes you sit on the end of your seat the whole film long. but it would not be such a good movie if it only keep the tension high the whole film, no it is the bonding you get with all the initial survivors of the crash, you become to know their life story and know what they had experienced in life. The 'you get to know the main persons' and the high tension combined with the fact you can see how hard it is to survive in the wild, made this a movie that struck me in my heart and cost me a lot of time thinking about the movie.This is a movie everyone should watch just because of the fact Liam Neeson is starring in it, but of course mainly because the movie thrills you from beginning till the end",The Grey

715,gregchelmo,"A film about life and death, but not in the way you think",8,1 February 2012,"After having read a number of reviews for this film I felt compelled to offer my theory about the film. This will touch on certain plot points that happen later in the film, so if you are yet to see it you may want to skip this review.In the opening piece of the film we find Neeson's character writing a suicide note in the form a letter to a missing loved one. We also see that he is living in a self-imposed purgatory in Alaska. He puts the gun to his mouth, but doesn't pull the trigger – or does he? In the next scene we see him boarding a flight with his co- workers. I propose that this flight symbolises his journey to the afterlife, and the plane crashing represents his literal arrival in Purgatory, which naturally matches the one which he built for himself in life.The survivors represent his life and memories, as they are gradually stripped away by the wolves, which in this theory could be angels attempting to help his passing.At the end of his journey he arrives in the heart of the wolves' lair, and is faced with the Alpha. It is at this point that we finally see who the missing loved one is – his beloved, who appears to have died of cancer. It is only upon facing the Alpha that he can deal with this final piece of himself, which leads me to believe that the Alpha is actually his soul, and the final battle between them represents him finally making peace with himself and the loss of his wife.This would also go some way to explain a few of the more fantastic elements of the film, which, if viewed as simply a survival thriller, enter the far-fetched: The leap across the gorge into the trees, and his relatively good health after being in the freezing water for some minutes, to name some.So, as a lot of other reviews point out, this film is very much about life and death, but not in the way that you may first think.Of course I could be completely pulling this out of thin air, but if you think about it, it works.Greg Matthews - Twitter: @gregchelmo 1/2/12",The Grey

I just got back from seeing ""The Grey"", and it is FAR from the exciting trailer I saw. Instead it's a slow, grim and occasionally intense/disturbing flick. It starts out with a pretty strong start. You get introduced to the characters, a brief background on Liam's character and before you know it, they're stranded in the wilderness and pit against a pack of ravenous, killer, monster-like wolves. The CGI and acting is very good. I had no problems. The wolf attack scenes were definitely intense and a bit disturbing. But after the big crash and first wolf attack, it all goes downhill from here. Long, lagging scenes of the survivors walking through the wilderness. That's pretty much what this movie is, with the occasional wolf- mauling-a-dude scene. I thought the movie would've been A lot better without the ending, though. With the sudden, abrupt ending it leaves you shaking your head and wanting your money back.

717,simonbakerlover,Hollywood at its best,6,22 June 2012,"After seeing all of the decidedly negative reviews for this movie, I decided to go ahead and put in my own opinion. When a movie like this comes along, we as the viewer have to understand that this is Hollywood at its best. In Hollywood, things become skewed in favor of drama. Once you accept that a movie like this is, at its core, made for pure entertainment and can't be taken seriously, you can enjoy it.And that's exactly what I did. If you're going into this movie expecting complete realism and plausible events, you're in the wrong movie. ""The Grey"" is about as realistic as a Hollywood wilderness movie can get. The film is filled with impossible situations, laughable moments of drama, and absolutely inane acts by our main characters. I won't go on because there's plenty of other reviews you can read that dutifully scrutinize every flaw in this movie.There's good things to be said about ""The Grey"", such as the beautiful Alaskan scenery that practically films itself and the fact that the wolves are almost photo realistic. The cast is essentially just a bunch of doomed characters and Liam Neeson, who does a good job of uttering his ridiculous lines to the point of making us root for him. And to the movie's credit, it does contain a few truly creative and deep moments.""The Grey"" is predictable and unintentionally funny and wolves don't really act like that. But if the director had made it into an utterly realistic survival story, well, it wouldn't really be a movie, would it? So if you can suspend disbelief (and I mean REALLY suspend it) for under two hours, you'll have fun watching this goofy thriller.",The Grey
718,bahramamirhosseini,Great Philosophy,7,6 June 2012,"I am not a wolf expert, a hunter or something. Regardless of what other viewers wrote about the wolves and their life, what they keep in den, how they attack, or how to survive in tough nature, I would like to open the other unseen window of the movie. I am referring to the philosophic conversations about believing or not believing in after life and God, how to face the death. Ottway was about to kill himself just before the plane crash, but what happened that suddenly he turned to be leader for group of people who wanted to survive. The only thing that we can remember in the last minutes of the death is love. Aren't they so close? Is human an animal? are we the BETTER creature? We usually think we are the only creature who talks, has feelings, uses tools and enjoys the life. We are wrong! very wrong! Of course we can think, that might have been caused through a Mutation on our brain cells. Who knows that may happen to wolves to turtles, birds. Didn't it happen to monkeys who transformed to humans? to us? That was great and ignored part of the movie. I also enjoyed the rhythm of the movie, no stop, no useless pause, good dialogs. I find it a good movie with great philosophy.",The Grey

So what if it isn't 100% accurate, movies are designed to allow you to get lost in a story for a couple hours. I believe a pack of wolves would attack a few men before Jason Statham jumps a car onto a moving train and beats 15 guys up with his t- shirt. The Grey is a non-stop thriller that'll make you jump, cry, and laugh. It is now one of my favorites and the fact it was pushed back to 2012 probably cost Neeson an Oscar. Disregard the likeliness of everything being possible or not and enjoy this story. By the way, it's: Liam Neeson...N-E-E-S-O-N.

The whole cast was Incredible and real. I was shivering in my seat from the cold whether they were In, as well as the fear they were surrounded by. I don't want to give anything away, but you must see this movie. It was mostly about surviving the most unbelievable trenches to try to save their lives for their families.I really felt for the Characters and truly got engaged in their survival. Of course Liem Neeson was amazing as usual. I can't wait to see this movie again. Just be prepared to have an exciting time at the movies.",The Grey
721,servethemaster,"Don't like ""Bait and Switch"" Movies like this... Liam should have known better!",3,31 January 2012,"In general, the directing, cinematography, locations and acting WERE good. Others can go into detail.ALERT! THIS IS A SPOILER! HOWEVER, The problem that the two people and I had when we sat through this movie was that we had seen multiple times the same preview of this movie. All previews show Liam Neeson tying broken bottles to his hand with tape and holding a knife in the other hand in a squatting position in preparation for having what appears to be a desperate fight with one or more wolfs. It appears this will be a scene that will be a hell of a fight somewhere towards the end of the movie.And, it turned out that all of this was correct...It did, indeed come at the end of the movie...the very final seconds! It was THE very last scene of the movie and absolutely unchanged from the many previews we had seen over the months; i.e; We were left with NO CLUE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT LIAM LIVES OR AT LEAST HOW MANY WOLVES HE IS ABLE TO TAKE DOWN WITH HIM BEFORE HE SUCCUMBS!Due to the fact that Liam is surrounded by what appears to be at least a dozen really ANGRY and GIANT, 300+lb. Wolves (Actual North American Gray Wolves range from 40 to 175 pounds!)most would say this is clearly the ""Last-Roundup"" for Liam. OK...Are we being too concrete in our expectations?The problem is that the whole movie builds Liam's character to be a very savvy, survivor...He is NOT portrayed as having super-natural skills. However, as detailed above, the previews lead one to think that Liem will in fact be a survivor. In addition, we believe this because in all(?) of Liam's previous movies it is always clear that he is an ordinary guy who uses his head and a little muscle to in some way beat the bad guys and save the day!Instead, this movie leaves the audience with essentially NO HOPE that that Liam will not end up a bloody mass-like-corpse like everyone else did over the previous ~80 minutes.This could be THE WORST EXAMPLE OF ""BAIT AND SWITCH"" IN THE MOVIE INDUSTRY since the days of the old cliff-hanger serials. If Liam does not want to be type-casted like a struggling, normal/guy next door (albeit, sometimes very rich) any more...that is fine with us! Just don't make us believe otherwise in the previews.We don't know what Liam was thinking here? Seems like a rip to us!",The Grey
722,leylith-lee19,"A few fabricated scenes, but one Hell of a ride",10,27 January 2012,"1st off, I want to clear up this Misconception about Live wolves used in this film: 4 carcasses were flown in for props and food(as One wolf was actually eaten on screen for the cast and characters to get in touch with the survival aspect of it), but NONE of them were killed before. They were already dead. So PETA, don't get your panties in a wad, I understand the severity of Animal rights, and as a Cherokee Indian, I believe in letting them live rather than hunt them.Now with that said, this is a SURVIVAL movie. Don't think for one second PETA that if a wolf chased me and I happened to be the sitting duck, I wouldn't think twice to kill it. Wouldn't THINK TWICE about it.As for the movie, it is visually and emotionally fantastic. From start to the controversial ending, it never ceases to deliver(even AFTER the credits role ;). A lost man at the end of his road, John Ottway (Neeson), Protects Alaskan oil employees, and as the last day arrives for them to go home, A horrific(and very realistic feel) plane crash leaves our characters stranded in the Middle of the Alaksan Death.Remember this movie is called the Grey for a reason, as it leaves the watcher to PAINT A PICTURE for himself, and only gives enough backdrop and visuals to created the scene in your mind.(Imo, fresh and original especially for a survival story).This movie was created for a debating issue. You can argue for hours about what and how each character copes with stress, survival, and vast decisions at the drop of a dime, and boy, you REALLY feel it throughout the entire movie.If your an avid outdoors man like myself, you will be RIGHT at home with this bad boy. I will be honest, I was P!SSED at the final scene, but WATCH AFTER THE CREDITS ROLE.For that, it gets a 9/1010/10 for the visuals, 10/10 for the cast 10/10 for ALMOST no CGI crap. 8/10 for story 10/10 for the reason and the blur the director sets you in.The Grey is the BEST title you could give this movie, as I found myself questioning my own morals and judgments after walking out of the theater.1/27/2012.",The Grey
723,toby-wilson4,Awful film!!!!!,2,27 January 2012,"The reviewers who gave this pile of rubbish the thumbs up must have been watching a different film to me. I was conned into seeing this from the very short trailer which looked exciting and the actor Liam Neeson who has been in some great movies. The film was far too long and the script was terrible with some cheesy and pointless dialogues in middle of forests when the idea was to get as far away from the wolves as possible. just standing around and chatting in sub zero temps wasn't going to help.I was expecting some terrific footage of the Alaskan scenery but a lot of it was CGI. They could have captured some stunning footage of the area, but failed miserably. Does anyone know the budget for this film. Must have been dirt cheap to make.So unnatural for wolves to act the way they did as these were more like aliens from a sci-fi movie.After having crashed and miraculously surviving a plane wreck, the worst thing to do would be to wander off into the wilderness. they could have built terrific defence around plane which was more or less intact. The characters were so clichéd and were only going to get eaten one by one, with Neeson the last man standing as he knew a little about wolves.I was so looking forward to a few fights in which they killed a load of wolves and the ending with the wallets and constant flashbacks to wives in bed was really bad. So surprised Neeson doing a movie about people dying in the snow considering his partner died after a skiing accident. Alive was a much better film, and a true story.If you are feeling depressed about anything and want to be cheered up, avoid at all costs. Even Liam Neeson wanted to shoot himself at the beginning.Awful, Do Not Bother!!!!!!",The Grey
724,lisa-mertz-buettiker,One of the worst movies ever...,2,27 January 2012,"Liam Neeson is great. Some funny jokes, but this is all that this movie has to offer. This movie offers: Wolves that do not behave as wolves and that do not look like wolves. Storyline with no surprises, each death of one of the 'survivors' can be expected, and the only good thing about the end of the movie is that you can finally leave the cinema. I expected a believable story made by people who know how wolves behave, how they fight and how people can survive in the cold and fight against a pack of wolves. But there is nothing like that. Not even a few nature scenes as a trade off for the awful storyline.Save your money and skip this movie. you don't miss anything.",The Grey
725,cvt288,Bad movie. I can't recommend it.,1,27 January 2012,"This is a poor movie. The wolves are not at all real and are based on MUCH more myth than reality. The quality of filming was poor, i.e. the sun is shining in the background in some snow scenes). The characters were not particularly believable, more two dimensional. The likelihood of anyone surviving a dunk in the water in Alaska in the snow for more than fifteen minutes is nil. As far as I could tell, the whole crowd around me panned the movie when it ended. That actually was the most enjoyable part of the movie, listening to the disbelief and angst of people who had had two hours of their lives robbed watching this movie.

I really liked Liam Neeson before this movie partially because he let his moves do the talking. In this movie he is far from that. The way he talked to and about God were very offending and over the top. The language throughout this movie was ridiculous and uncalled for. I feel like I need to pour battery acid in my ears to cleanse them of the unnecessary language in this movie. The plot of the movie in general was terrible. The only entertainment I got out of this movie was counting how long it took for the wolves to close in after someone fell down or fell asleep.

727,hbanc-057,"Raw survival action, at times deep, steers clear of boring predictability with solid original scrip and intelligent scene work.",8,27 January 2012,"I just saw this movie at the Arclight in sunset. I wasn't expecting much of it. I skimmed over the summary and skipped the trailer all together. Naturally when it started, I was reading into the plot as cliché after cliché. But things started picking up pace nicely. The action got going and the actor quality started to show its shine. Most of the actors did pretty decent work. The movie had it slow-downs, but not to the point where it would bog down the movie. After intense action it really helped to let the danger and suspense sink in. It's quite a relief to see a director take good long shots of a scene where nothing seems to be going on. It helps focus on what the immediate character is feeling. The turnout of the characters is probably what'll separate those who love this flick and those who hate it. I won't say anything more of it. Personally, I loved the ending and I invite everyone who is planning to watch this movie to sit through the credits as well. I do during every movie I watch at the cinema. On a last note, I am an avid fan of horror flicks and found this movie especially satisfying because of it. The pounding suspense really borders on full- fledged horror. People with faint hearts be at rest, there are only a few grizzly scenes that you can watch from in between your finger tips. There's plenty of comedy to go around, some heartfelt moments. And before I forget, I'd like to mention I especially liked what the director did with dream and flashback transitioning. There is some cliché in character types and personality development, but the originality outweighs it. If you are indecisive as to whether you should watch this movie or not, I say just go for it. It's better than a lot of what is out right now at the box.",The Grey

LMAO what fairy tale world do you people live in. The fact of the matter is wolves have always killed people. in the 90's in India over 120 people were killed by wolves since 2000 there has been plenty of attacks on people and deaths in North America in fact in 2010 Candice Berner in ALASKA out jogging was surrounded and killed by wolves.

I loved the scenery, shooting, sound, and excitement, but it was a little taxing to have it end the way it did. After the roller coaster ride the viewer goes on with the cast, the film ended with me feeling unfulfilled. If you've seen it, you know what I'm talking about. The story felt 99% told.Liam Neeson is amazing. The first film I remember seeing him in was Rob Roy, and I really can't remember seeing him perform less than admirably. The supporting cast was fantastic, too, and I hope to see more of them. Dermot Mulroney was perfect and oddly the guy I could identify with the closest. Dallas Roberts nailed it, and I'd never seen Frank Grillo before, but I bought into him like an Apple fanboy with a new iMac.Great job to the cast, the entire crew, and whoever wrote the screenplay. I just wanted a little more at the end, and a little less in the middle. There were some scenes that seemed stressed and pulled from the pace a wee bit.It seems plausible to me that someone might see a review from a guy in Nebraska as something less than insightful or poignant, which is okay. ""Big City Folk"" still think we don't have running water or electricity, but the fact is, we're simply unencumbered by the smugness that seems to accompany living in or being from a city with a population over a couple million. The point is, read this review or don't. It's the first time in a long time I've posted a review, and it's all because this film is totally worth the time.In closing: Go see it in the theater - it's awesome.

Contrary to what this movie wants us to believe, wolves don't ""send messages"" to humans and they certainly don't ""kill"" humans just for the sake of killing them. They kill to eat! Stupid, silly premise!

The Grey, unfortunately, left me cold for reasons that have everything to do with the writing - cardboard characters, predictable and unbelievable survival story, and enough existentialist nonsense to satisfy the appetites of philosophers such as Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone De Beauvoir and Albert Camus. A survival movie shouldn't be about the obvious obstacles, but about the surprises the human spirit may achieve. Think Deliverance. Now, that was a survival movie of the first caliber, as well as the movie Alive. The Grey was good for the first ten minutes, and after that it crashed and burnt. It'll probably do very well at the box office solely on the strength of its star Liam Neeson who is an absolute stud. Otherwise, it's nothing more than 90 minutes of wasted time that could be put toward more constructive things such as watching Taken or Unknown.

Furthermore, The movie is completely unpredictable even though the plot is very simple. The cinematography was excellent. The setting was real and brutal. I never cry during a movie, however I had to try very hard to keep it together during this film. Last but not least, Liam Neeson was very impressive.

The only complaint I really have is Liam Nelson cussing at God (yes I am Christian)but this does make the ending a little better after his scene. I do agree with some of the other reviews about the whole river scene and him not getting hypothermia, and them not taking a chance on fighting the wolves, but the other reviewers who complain about the ending I disagree with. The ending was put together very well I thought besides the whole cut out fight.

738,vinkx004,"Great film, but not for everyone",10,30 January 2012,"I went into this movie expecting a basic survival movie with a shallow story-line and minimal development into the characters. I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of time that was devoted towards creating a relationship between the audience and the cast. To me, this was a movie that was well thought out and not thrown together to make a quick buck, as is too often the case these days. So many movies leave much to be desired by their lack of creativity and pandering to teenager audiences. I'm tired of the cliché one liners and nonsensical violence and sex in those films. Now, when I say that I'm tired of movies with nonsensical sex and violence, I mean movies that have it just for the sake of having it. Make no mistake, this movie has a lot of blood and gore. However, it also is a necessary element and is tastefully placed(in my opinion) at times to augment the pure horror you feel for the characters as they attempt to survive impossible odds. I've seen reviews critique this film for its violence and for its language. To these people, I would suggest doing a little more research before you go and see a film, rather than being critical of it for things that you should have screened out yourself. Therefore, if you are a person who is easily offended, or have a weak stomach for blood and guts, DON'T GO SEE THIS MOVIE!To me, the language and outright crudeness of the characters are what make the movie realistic and compelling. We are talking about a group of men who have spent the last multiple months working on an oil pipeline, mostly among other men. They are poorly educated characters and from the working class. They aren't choir kids. Anyone who has ever spent time working in a blue collar job would have heard most of this language already. This movie is a realistic look into how this type of group would act and react to a stressful situation. Hollywood always tends to exaggerate some things. Of course there are scenes in this movie where you are left scratching your head, but you would be doing yourself a disservice by over analyzing every little thing that doesn't seem believable or that doesn't make sense. The acting in this movie is top notch. Much of the time, you find yourself believing that you are watching a film of actual events just based on that. The special effects are also great and the movie draws you in so deep that it's almost like you can feel the freezing wind and snow blowing in your face. Typically, I don't expect much of a story out of a movie like this, but I was pleasantly surprised by how many subplots this movie had. It makes you want to know more about Neeson's character's past and is a commentary on running from your demons. It's a story of resilience, purpose, redemption, and faith testing. Overall, I would recommend this movie for action/horror/drama aficionados. This movie is so much more than a basic drama or horror, though. The movie leaves you feeling a wide range of emotions for the characters and leaves you sitting on the edge of your seat, waiting to see what happens next. 10/10",The Grey

The ending alone is enough to anger and frustrate any normal blooded viewer, but add to that all the foolishness the characters display and you have to have no intellect to enjoy this movie. Let me list the stupid things the characters do: 1. They leave the downed plane to head off on their own without a clue where they are or where they are headed. When someone says that a search and rescue will be coming, Neeson's character flatly denies that they will be able to find them. His remarks are supposed to indicate the stupidity of the rescuers but only confirms his own. 2. They leave the plane, which could have easily been converted into a formidable protection for the group and head out into the open to be picked off by deranged wolves that think smarter than the humans. 3. They all seem to have knives and duct tape, why not cut off some branches from the trees and tape the knives to the ends of them and then spear the wolves instead of that cockamamy idea of trying to set off shotgun shells at the end of sticks. 3. In the wild, with predators lurking, you never walk empty handed. You would make a spear and walk with that. These fools wander around without so much as a club for protection. 4. When they finally kill a wolf, Neeson's character tells them to eat up as that is the last meat they will have. It seems they cant think well enough to pack up the rest of the meat and carry it with them! 5. Anyone who would consider a plan of jumping off a cliff in the hopes of landing in the opposite side trees has got to be suffering from brain damage. 6. In the end Neeson prepares to square off against alpha male Wolf and tapes airplane liquor bottles between his fingers as a sort of mace. The only thing that will do is cut his own hand to ribbons when the glass shatters in the fight. 7. Neesons' character has his meltdown moment and rails at God for not helping him...I couldn't help but smile at what God's reply might have been, ""Have you considered using the brain I gave you?!""No but he tells God, 'f*@K it. I'll do it myself..."" and promptly walks into the middle of the wolf den. Good job on the DIY Neeson!8. And of course the finale. What a let down by the director. To get us all prepared for the final battle and then fade to credits is simply fraudulent. I understand that filming a battle scene like that would cost a lot of money, but the movie is so cheaply made to begin with that you'd think they had enough to film it. This is touted as an action survival movie not an art house 'life is like that' crap. So forget the arty ending and give us the beef (no pun intended). And it does not do to have to wait through 15 mins of end credits to just have a flash of an exhausted and bloody Neeson and wolf sprawled on the ground. If this is a set up for a sequel, then that is just plain not good form.My suggestion, rent the Edge with Anthony Hopkins for an intelligent and credible survival tale. My final thought, I hope Bear Grylls does a send up of this movie by doing a show showing all the stupid things these guys did that ensured none of them survived.",The Grey
746,nvrmr,One of the best,8,2 February 2012,"Every once in awhile a movie comes along that becomes a masterpiece. Devils Advocate, Fight Club, Lord of War, and the Dark Knight. The Gray is one of the best films that i have ever seen in my life. Yes there wasn't a lot of fighting or high tech special effects. The acting from Liam Neeson was one of his best in years. Also the side actors and what they would really go though in that kind of situation was just incredible. There has been rare occasions that i want to walk back into the the theater and watch it again and this film made me want to do just that. If you love movies the way i do and love story and acting, not just special effects and high tech fighting i highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone....in conclusion, this will be one of the best film in decades, if you don't think the same way i do after you see it then you have no imagination and you don't know what true art form is...go see it...you have to, its worth every cent and you wont be disappointed.",The Grey

How about a damn ending!!!,4,2 February 2012,"This movie had a chance to be my favorite movie but It failed and ill tell you why. First off Neesons character ""John"" knew a lot about wolves but didn't even set up one make shift trap to even the numbers! So we get to see characters that we fall in love with(Because they're flawed in a way that is real!)die through the whole movie with no revenge to satisfy our blood lust..""John instead speaks of doing so, but they only killed one omega in the whole movie!! After we see all these guys die after we get to know them..We come to a big moment when Liam Neeson's character is the last man standing and he comes to terms with his own impending death. We find his wife was ill and the two Alphas( John and the wolf) come face to face...Liam neeson ties shards of glass around one hand and a knife to the other, There's a shot of his eyes getting ready for battle! He lunges forward!!Then credits! I get why some of you say thats good enough. In my opinion- I saw guys get eaten the whole movie and know its not! The perfect ending of the movie would have been the way it was..But I would have put flashes of the battle in between credit reels..That way your not killing the movie by over explanation but your not leaving us unsatisfied! Battle scene/credits/battle scene/credits/battle scene...Liam standing bloodied over the body of the Alpha wolf...Credits to the end! Thats my epic ending!! I thought i'd be buying this movie before I even saw it..But ""The Edge"" with Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin remains the best man against nature movie..They ruined The Grey and it had so much potential..Me as well as 30 other people sat in our seats until the screen went black hoping for more!! Great premise...But not enough!!",The Grey

M quite shocked seeing the ratings 9/10, 8/10, for this film. Yet another a disappointing film from Liam Neeson . Never ever expected Liam Neeson to venture in film like this one . Although i used to be a very big fan of Liam neeson and now i am highly disappointed . Cant believe this is the same man who has given films like Schindler's List , Taken , Batman Begins etc etc . i want to ask other reviewers that what they have seen so special in the film that they have rated as 9/10, 8/10 . I cudn understand the very motive of this film. Seriously i want to know what the director exactly wanted to show us through this film. There were no such thrilling sequences in the film , relatively a slow film , an abstruse ending of the film etc etc .",The Grey
749,zuza-k-f-282-300512,Well done on getting bums in seats to watch this! Much needed. Loved it.,10,3 February 2012,"I am definitely not the demographic for this and would never have seen it based on the trailers, but I was intrigued by the reviews.I'm loving the fact that, as one tweet I saw put it, the marketing campaign conned the unsuspecting 20-something male ticket-buying masses into 2 hours of an action-laced re-imagining of Waiting for Godot. Well, perhaps it wasn't quite Waiting for Godot (that's setting one very high bar), but it certainly tried to go there, in its own populist way, and I my books, did a pretty good job.BTW, I'm surprised by all the comments on here complaining that it's a plot less movie – the director came right out and said just that, in those exact words, no less. It's not about the plot. It's about these men and their emotional journey, about loss and about death. Not Neeson punching wolves. And thank god for that. I thought it was superbly executed, perfectly cast, well-acted (that goes for the entire cast) and well-scripted. Liam Neeson is clearly a stand-out. His performance rings true on every level – and probably partly due to the fact that he's had personal experience to draw on here. It was hard watching this without thinking of Natasha, and perhaps that's why he was so keen on the role. He has said it was cathartic to play this, but I think it was actually quite brave of him to take this on. It could have gone very badly, but I think he pulled it off with aplomb, and I hope he gets recognised for it. It's refreshing to see more real mean on screen. I'm sick of all these shirtless pretty boys occupying the film mainstream with no substance and no real dirt under their nails. (This coming from a 20-something straight female, for what it's worth). Overall, a very moving and beautifully executed film. Highly recommended.",The Grey
750,jdchrisman,Quite Disappointed,3,4 February 2012,"I am usually a fan of Liam Neeson; but don't go see this movie unless you are prepared to have your ears assaulted by a continuous stream of pointless potty-mouthed profanity. The writers of this script either wanted to demonstrate a lack of intelligence and vocabulary in their characters or were suffering from such issues themselves (or both). And though a bit of vulgarity is expected on the part of characters with backgrounds such as these, this went way above and beyond and resulted in dialogue that was not only difficult to endure, but also distracted from the action and plot of the movie itself (the former actually being better than the latter). And the ending well, ""Ugh!"" is all I have to say about that. So be warned and save your dough – if you're venturing out to the theatre, don't waste your money on ""The Grey.""",The Grey
751,brownsword-jack,Enjoyable and for everyone...,8,4 February 2012,"Whether you look deeply into this movie or not, it is enjoyable, borderline brilliant. Action, tension and harsh weather; all complemented by the undeniably soothing voice of Liam Neeson.A brief insight into the life of Liam Neesons character John Ottway and we see that he is a troubled man. He kills wolves, misses his wife (and doesn't shut up about her) and seemingly hates his existence. That is until the plane he's on decides to lose it's power and starts free-falling. This is when we are introduced to the other characters in the film, and their individual personalities. Briefly, of course, as the plane crashes soon after. The plane crash itself was a highlight for me, as the sound and atmosphere seemed quite realistic and i'll probably remember that scene the next time I hope on a plane to Alaska.This is where the fun really starts. Liam Neeson is immediately established as the know-it-all leader of the group of survivors, with his knowledge of the wolves that are now hunting the hunters. The deaths of the survivors are usually quite predictable, but exciting nonetheless. Everyone get's decimated, in pretty brutal ways, so don't go hoping for any happy endings. Getting mauled, falling from a tree hitting every branch on the way down then cracking your head on the floor before getting eaten by wolves and... drowning, are all present in this movie. The drowning being particularly uncomfortable to watch. These deaths are split up by chit chat between the group where we learn about the individuals lives, and an important yet subtle conversation about religious beliefs.Everyone dying obviously leads up to a huge finale, where Ottway (Neeson) is left alone. If you are looking for a deep story, this part plays a big role. Ottway shouts for god to help him, which is followed by him realising he's alone and carries on with his travels, perhaps reflecting the movies' creators' views.Then it happens. What I found to be quite an effective ending. Ottway realises he has walked into the wolves den, irony at its finest. The alpha male wolf appears, and we can see what is about to happen. It is revealed that Ottways wife, who we see glimpses of throughout the movie, has actually died and a poem that Ottways abusive father wrote comes into play. Ottway readies himself with a knife, and some DIY Wolverine Claws using broken liquor bottles and comes face to face with the big daddy of the wolves. Alpha male vs Alpha male. We are left to decide what happened in the fight, but considering he was surrounded by wolves we guess that Ottway died. That is unless you watch until after the credits, where we have a brief glimpse of Ottway lying on top of the wolf, both seemingly dead or dying.This was a fantastic piece of cinema, whether you are looking for a thriller, a bit of action or a deep plot. It succeeds in all aspects apart from some minor faults (such as Ottway waking a good 100 ft away from the plane crash site). The setting also made me cold throughout. 8/10",The Grey
752,ed_edd_and_eddy,The Way Back was better and it didn't have wolves,3,9 February 2012,"I enjoyed the first half of this movie simply because I wanted to enjoy it. I went into the theatre having really liked Taken and Unknown and was expecting to feel the same about this. But after about halfway I was getting more and more desperate, and I knew deep down in my heart it had failed. Here is a rambling of some of the problems:I did not care about the characters, the movie certainly tried to make me feel for them but it just didn't work. I felt nothing for Neeson and his flashbacks, they, along with a few other scenes, were just annoying and made me feel the film was trying too hard to be deep and emotional. There was no surprise when it was shown to us at the end that his wife had been dying, it was guessed she was most likely dead during the opening scene. I felt nothing while Neeson was comforting the dying man on the plane - there was a similar scene in TV series Birdsong which almost had me in tears. I felt nothing when the camera repeatedly showed Neesons hand laying down and patting the wallets of the fallen. When there was only two survivors left I found myself asking 'who is this other guy? Has he been here the whole time??' Again, I did not feel what the director was probably wanting me to feel when it was his turn to be knocked off. When Neeson was shouting to the Heavens - a moment which could have made me believe and actually feel for this character a little - it was ruined as I was too busy being annoyed by the fact he had not suffered a single shiver after emerging from the frozen river! I was especially disappointed with this as earlier in the film I had been impressed by the lengths Neeson had went to to convey the cold - after awakening from the plane crash his face was red raw, clearly he had actually exposed himself to freezing temperatures in order to be realistic. So I was only left to wonder how many body heaters he had under his jacket when climbing out of the river.. Now had he been screaming at God whilst suffering severe uncontrollable body spasms, that would have been something! Instead I was half expecting God to appear in the sky, that's how nonsense this film is. The wolves.. I was uncertain if these wolves were meant to be supernatural or not. They did not act like I thought wolves would act. The way they were purposefully taking their revenge etc. However, Neeson's inside knowledge of the wolf's behaviour and instincts helped. This should have been built on, with other reviews hitting the nail on the head so I won't repeat.The impossible jump and the rope which appeared out of nowhere..Who was logging a single tree at the top of a cliff?The chances of stumbling into the wolves den? Really?By the time Neeson finally got ready to kick some ass I was too far gone to care, and I wasn't bothered when they cut to the credits without showing any action, it summed up the whole film for me. Promising, but did not deliver.",The Grey

I love Liam and was looking forward to his next action movie, but this movie started out grim and never got off the ground. I'm limited on space, but for starters, I would have liked a little more history on the wolves -- it's a scary movie, make something up! And I got bored of watching them walk thru snow - again - and get eaten by wolves - AGAIN -- but wait! There's always Liam's last and only friend dying not by a wolf, but drowning instead. I expected a little smarter script for Liam than, ""What the hell are you doing?!?"" as his friend drowns -- I mean, c'mo-o-on! And then the peek after the credits -- WTHeck was THAT??? It was so up close, you couldn't see anything and after seeing everyone die anyway, why ruin a perfectly terrible movie to tease you into thinking someone or something actually lived???

757,lisaardithgignac,A chill factor that drives you to question everything!,8,17 February 2012,"Don't deny yourself the thrill of fear that emanates from this movie. At one point when I was young, youthful, and daring to join the Peace Corp and make a difference in my world, I favored and respected wolves. I was naïve and only cherished the outside of pictures and endangered species campaigns that I read about. I didn't do due diligence and actually read up about them. When I saw the trailer for ""The Grey"", I was so excited and captured by the story. I knew I would see it opening day. Unfortunately, my car broke down and I was forced to wait a week to see it in the theater. It was that anticipation, that lovely excitement that prompted me to read about the wolf. Wolves are motivated by instinct and instinct alone. Their drive to eat flesh, to survive, compels them to do things that are wretched and ugly. The stories that I read online astounded me. Wolves actually stopped the Russians and the Germans had to stop fighting in war to combine their efforts to fend off attacking wolves. Wolves are infamously known for carrying children off and eating them. Even ""Little Red Riding Hood"" alludes to that. They are also known for attacking groups of strong men and taking them down, exactly as they did in this fictional piece. So, after reading about the numerous killings of man by wolves historically since the spawn of man, I was not keen on the idea of seeing them chase and kill humans in a movie. What captured me about ""The Grey"" was the fact that in the trailer, there was a sense of identifying with Liam Neeson's character in that I felt solitude much like he portrayed in this picture, all of this last year in my efforts to survive my own tragedies. I identified with his plight to survive in a way, I suppose. Each of the characters in the movie, eventually banned together in effort to fend off the wolves, to survive, but in reality on the inside we are alone with our thoughts, alone with our internal plight to move forward or to acquiesce and accept death. I will forever be at peace with his description of the fact that death washes over you like warmth. It makes sense though, considering the body releases high amounts of endorphins and other chemicals to suppress pain. The body has a way to medicate itself naturally. I am not afraid of death, but this day, which is all that I can count on, this day I will ""live"". As for Liam, -40 is terribly cold, especially considering the wind chill factors. I have hiked extensively and done some mountaineering. My hat's off to him for enduring such extreme climatic conditions for his role in ""The Grey"". I was a little disappointed in the ending of the movie. I wanted more. I didn't want it to end.",The Grey

I actually also like silly movies but not when they pretend to be something else than silly. And that's the case in this movie.

If you want something that has a shred of a plot, or in anyway reflects what happens here on planet earth, then your time is probably better spent learning to make napkin origami or signing up for an online dating service.The number of 8-10 star reviews for this movie makes me weep for humanity because either there exists such a person that actually thinks this is a good movie, or the person has a sick enough sense of humor to rate this film high for irony.

Good start to the film good acting,good atmosphere,good sound the wolves genuinely sound like a T-Rex being raped very impressive and the plot ticks along nicely slowly picking of the survivors in quite plausible ways,as we see them turning from the macho bravado of the begginning into emotional soft hearted family men who are scared even Liam starts reciting poetry and talking about his Daddy.But who are we kidding the film can show us the frailty of man coping with the inevitability of death. There is only one man left Irishman Liam Neeson and after a slightly ridiculous harmless dip in a freezing cold river he is the last man standing and how does he accept death?

No, this only happens at the very very end of the movie, and before he even swings a punch, the movie black outs and the credits roll. I HATE THIS MOVIE, and if I ever see this director in public, I will have to refrain from yelling in face. Simply put, if you came to see Liam Neeson fight wolves, then you came to the wrong movie.

I found that the movie did a great job in illuminating character (Liam Neeson) in a way that you were able to see the heart of him and the other characters that played in the film. The movie raised theological thinking where it was able to ask ultimate questions. It illuminated the idea of rather or not there should be belief in the existence of a God or a higher power. There was a constant pull with this idea throughout the film. I love that the movie was consistent throughout showing the constant struggle that the individuals were having not only with themselves but with something that could potentially be bigger than them. The movie was able to capture the struggle of Liam Neeson's character to want to have the fight in him to live on amidst the tragedies that were taking place in his life and had already.

Let us not forget when does frostbite or hypothermia come into play. In the entire movie no one showed signs of being cold, especially when he hit the water. I know for a fact how fast cold water reduces body temperature and at that temperature, without fire and dry clothes there is no surviving! This wasn't even close to being a good movie, and I am a Liam Neeson fan. With the technology we have today, there would have been some kind of beacon on the aircraft and the tower that was tracking it would have seen it disappear from the radar screen.",The Grey

The title does not really prepare you for the depressing moments that you will encounter, ( specially the latter part of the film) . I watched the film again specially for those parts. Now you might believe this to be a confusing thought or even disturbing , but the way this film has been shot is more beautiful than all other survival films. Liam Neeson who plays the character of Ottway, has the perfect eyes for this role, in fact his stone cold face gives you a inhuman feeling during a shot where he is comforting a dying man , by telling him "" You are going to die "". My hair stood up, i felt every strand tickling. He is bloody convincing as a veteran hunter, who makes a living out of hunting wolves,to protect a bunch of thankless oil rig workers in the middle of no where. He is tired and looking for some purpose in his life, and is having difficulties living the rest of it.When the Flight they are heading back from the north pole crashes literally no where, He leads the 7 survivors and tries to guard them from the wolves he has hunted for sometime, for now its their turn to hunt.The crew( sound, editing and others) of this film has done everything right, so much as to create one of the perfect film experience's i have in my lifetime. Hope you will have the same feeling after you finish with this, a feeling that no matter how twisted and pointless your life may seem, it deserves some appreciation.",The Grey
773,patmonteiro-mon,Big plot holes,6,15 March 2012,"This movie is highly overrated and has more plot holes than a Swiss Cheese. One minute it's a blizzard, the next, the calmest place on Earth, and then, back to the blizzard again. One moment, they are not able to take one step in the snow and the other they run as in the marathon. They jump a cliff, to escape the wolves but, when they reach the other side, the wolves are already there. A wolf kills a man with two bites and he dies instantly as if he has been shot.In one scene a man holds a rope, build out of clothes that is strong enough to stop the free fall of a man, by his fingertips against all laws of physics. The computer generated wolves are not realistic. A positive note tough, the crash of the plane is very well done and the sound is good. It simulates well a plain crash. The movie starts well and it's very intense for the first hour, or so, but then loses momentum and becomes too slow. One gets to the end with the feeling that the, almost two hours of movie, are too much.",The Grey
774,coppacuoriainen,Fairly good movie,6,17 March 2012,"I have to say I liked the story. But, as being from the lands where are wolves, snow, forest, frost and bears and other fluffy things, I have to say that I found the happenings of the movie to be utterly unrealistic. That is why i couldn't really enjoy the movie. There are a lot of wolves in my heritage woods, which is quite a big land area. I often hear them howling and see tracks what they leave. I've been in the woods since I was a child. Hunting and just wandering, with and without guns or gear and I can say that I almost grew up in the woods. In reality, wolves are very shy and cowardly and I just find it ridiculous how they are pictured in this movie. I'm not saying this could not happen, that wolves prey humans. It just cannot happen how it is pictured in the movie. Human must be half dead, alone and deep in the woods at night for wolves to attack. And in that case they must be starving, really. And still, it must be very, very rare. However, I found it to be realistic that you could freeze to death. But not when you are sleeping, never. At least not when you are laughing and having fun in the previous take. It is hard to even fall asleep in the very cold conditions. Then you merely stay awake. Only case you can freeze to death peacefully is when you are hammered and pass out in the frost and snow. And it just annoyed me how they just light a fire in a very harsh conditions; in reality it is the most important and often the hardest things to do. Overall, I think it is an entertaining movie, but not necessarily for those who knows the 'woods'.",The Grey

By the time the end of this movie arrives and Ottway is left on his own to fight the alpha male armed only with a small selection of miniature whiskies anything could have happened. It would have come as no great surprise if a flying saucer had majestically swooped down from the sky to Ottway's rescue. As this is my first review I was rather hoping to write something in a more positive manner. But there are no redeeming qualities. At times I found myself laughing, sometimes I was open mouthed in disbelief. At least it did remind me why I now mainly watch foreign language films. The biggest issue with this movie was that Ottway did not shoot himself at the start. In fact he could have done us all a favour and shot the cameras filming this rubbish.",The Grey
776,btp419,Unrealistic Entertainment,2,17 June 2012,"Maybe these were the wolves from Twilight because real wolves do not behave this way. Where do I start, there are so many unrealistic and inaccurate aspects to this film. As an Alaskan who has been to the Prudhoe Bay oil fields I found myself shaking my head a lot in the first few minutes. Here are a few of the first things; There is no wolf that would charge a group of humans working with power tools, There are NO trees or mountains anywhere near Prudhoe Bay, there are no bars and no alcohol allowed in Prudhoe (and there are not that many women in Prudhoe and they sure are not even close to being that attractive), there are no guns allowed in the oil fields aside from the bear hazers who carry shot guns, wolves do not exhibit this behavior, even considering how large AK it is a small place and there would be a massive rescue effort starting with the Air National Guard and staying with the plane would be the safest and quickest option. I literally could go on and on but we have only watched 30 minutes of the movie so far but, if you do not care anything about accuracy and want something entertaining in a light horror suspense genre I guess you might like this movie.",The Grey
777,keithan-rogers,Some truth,9,24 March 2012,"I had to create an account to comment on the top few reviews about this movie. The people who wrote them are not very informed on what they speak.Everyone says the movie is unrealistic. People surviving plane crashes: Really happens; Sleeping outside in the cold: Really happens, in fact I have been to several winter survival schools, we do it all the time, it happens without fire too; Wolves: if you are threatening a wolf it will kill you. ""Animal shows"" are a horrible source of information. It is downright ironic you quote animal shows as your source to discredit a movie; Doubt anyone has been to Alaska, because you can survive outside much longer than 3 days. Not to mention all of the people who were there had been working many years and had all their luggage. ""probably sub zero"" is idiotic. It was MAYBE close to zero in real life. Regardless, not that cold. Then you say he would be dead in 30 minutes after jumping into the river. Don't know if you looked at your watch but it wasn't 30 minutes until he died. He also stripped clothing off between those scenes, which is what you would need to do to survive.Neeson didn't seem like a survival expert to me, wolf-killer sure. His rifle broke in half, and he knew more about surviving than anyone. Example, they would never have been found in reality, in a situation like that escape is your only option and you are a fool if you think otherwise. RULE 1 in survival is USE WHAT YOU HAVE. Why the hell would you make your life harder trying to start fires with a homemade bow when you have airplane fuel and lighters with you? Are you kidding me?Hilarious that they were laughing around a fire? You lose hope and you die. Humor is the easiest way to promote unity and instill hope. Miraculously found sheets? It looked like shirts to me, and they all were carrying full packs of salvaged things from the plane. If you knew an ounce about survival you'd know rope is one of the most useful tools and could be made with almost anything. Wolves travel much faster than humans. You people giving negative reviews need to give good reasons, like the acting sucked. It was a movie, and movies are made a certain way, to make money. Shrek is much more unrealistic but I doubt you are giving that negative reviews huh. All the BS aside from reading the first few reviews, the movie was very well done. Liam Neeson is as badass as always, the realism is there for the most part. The one thing I noticed is night is not that long in Alaska. Several hours at most where they were. I would recommend it to anyone.",The Grey
778,gijasonm14,Great survival Drama!,8,27 March 2012,"*********Spoiler Alert**********Personally I found this movie very inspiring and a reminder that we are not the top of the food chain because we sit around all day watching movies about being the top of the food chain. It was nice to see some of the challenges faced with survival and how difficult it can be even with 7 people.Although this movie was enjoyable to watch, I have to agree with other reviews that it would never be exactly like this if your plane crashed in Alaska and you would have to survive.I can deal with them making a rope of sheets, and Liam getting bit in the leg and still being able to run. It was when he fell into the river and was unaffected that bothered me. If you are ice cold in Alaska and the only thing you have are the clothes on your back, then you take a dip in freezing cold water, take it from me, you will die.The only thing keeping you alive is the air insulated in your clothing, ignoring the waters temp, your clothes being super saturated in freezing temps means your clothing freezes, and most of that air is lost.Its important to remember though, that this is a movie. I watch movies to be entertained, not to be lectured. If I wanted to learn how to survive in Alaska, or how wolves behave in their own climate then I'll go watch a documentary. The Grey is a great flick that gave me goosebumps at times. I recommend watching this movie if you are a fan of Liam Neeson or horror/dramas.",The Grey

I didn't know there was still free wild wolves, when suddenly a pack of wolves were standing in front of us, through the darkness the only think we could see was their yellow eyes fixed on us, and... my god the spooky howling and grunts still gives me cold in the back. I've never been so scared in my life, luckily for me, my cousin had good knowledge in this kind of situation. His plan was simple...

Some of of the stuff they do may seem silly, for example, the cloth rope that the attach to the tree. And the the bullet sticks seem ludicrous, but I guess anything that would fend of hungry wolves would be valid.Now to the bad things... The sound. The sounds the wolves make is shocking, its repeated and there is probably only 5-6 sound files they used, and the wolves look kind of odd. WAY to many jumped scenes!

Even discounting the fact that the events are beyond improbable, you have a poorly made movie. It was filled with predictable jump scares, unsympathetic characters, illogical decisions, and just plain poor storytelling. We have ""shakeycam"" and awful sound editing (the kind of movie where half the characters are whispering and impossible to decipher, and then a few seconds later the music is roaring). The CGI is also beyond pitiful; the wolves in the freaking Twilight series are more fluid and believable than these poorly framed, jerky creatures. The effects here remind me of the werewolves on True Blood- the kind of CGI you expect from a million-dollar an episode television show, not a mainstream film.In ten years, this film will be a nice time capsule of what not to do for film students to watch.",The Grey

I rarely watch a movie without checking its IMDb score these days, though this time i did because Liam Neeson is one of my favorite actors. Even with that in mind this is easily the worst movie I've seen this year. The movie is unrealistic to the point of stupidity, they wander around the cold for days yet don't seem to freeze to death and when Liam Neeson falls into a river he emerges in soaking wet clothes which he continues to wear even though i know for a fact you'd be dead. I find it hard to describe in words how disappointing this movie is, the gesture of creating this account simply to complain about it shows how bad it was. Not only is it unrealistic its just downright unsatisfying, at the beginning of the film you get the feeling that Neeson is some survival/marksman expert. though in the end he's helpless, almost everything he does gets one of his friends killed and some of the decisions he makes a 10 year old would no its a bad idea. don't bother watching this unless your extremely bored because its just stupid.",The Grey
785,c-koenig-webdesign,Fantasy or survival film?,3,12 April 2012,"When I see an IMDb rating above 7, for me that's mostly an indicator for a ""good"" or even a ""really good"" movie. Not in case of ""The Grey""! NOTHING in this film makes sense! Let's start off with the wolves: I don't know about alaskan wolves but over here in Europe a wolf would never dare to attack a group of people even when it's starving to death. These animals just don't do that! But so far so good, we all know wolf myths in films. But in this case they could have at least came up with a remotely plausible story that would explain the wolves aggressive and irrational behaviour: Zombie wolfs, genetic-mutant-wolves, whatever! But the whole wolf thing is not even the main problem here: So they're all sitting in this ice desert and get frequently attacked by these mutant wolves. So rather than all gathering inside the plain (or what's left of it) they leave a single guy, armed with a stick in the open for night watch. Needles to say that this guy gets killed the first night. But it's getting better: The next day they decide to leave the plain wreck (which in my opinion offered excellent shelter) to go to the woods. Explanation: ""The wolves think that we don't belong here in the open"". Ahh right - Wolves only attack people in the open ... never inside the woods. When they reach the woods even more people get killed which reveals another disturbing fact of this film: Imagine you just survived a plain crash and just watched three of your associates get slaughtered by killer-wolfs. What would you do? Sitting by the fire, laughing and telling jokes? No? Cause thats what they do. The dullness of this film continues when they reach the top of a cliff that blocks their path to a river and decide to go bungee jumping with an improvised rope made of clothes. Explanation at this point: They can not see behind the cliff so they just have to find out whats down there by jumping. ...Thats right! Bur apart from the stupid and irrational behaviour of the characters there are also some (really just laughable) logic failures. Like Neelson having a swim in ice water for a good 5 minutes and and then walking around in wet clothes without DYING. This film is really more of a fantasy than a survival film. Don't waste your time like I did.",The Grey

After leaving the room, I realized that I was wrong.The movie is as groundbreaking as breathtaking, every character is not what you really anticipate to be. The movie fleshes them nicely, with some Philosophical moments that leaves the viewer thinking. Liam Neeson is and always be the man; if there's a religion in which Chuck Norris is the God, I'm pretty sure Neeson could have one too. He just fits perfectly for the role of the leader, facing all his problems and finally becoming the real hero of the story.I know that many people states this, but I created this account only to write a review of this movie, because I realized I needed to. There are thrilling, funny and touching moments, What else could you ask for in a survival movie?And about the ending, if you don't like then you don't get the point. Its a great ending. The whole purpose of the movie wasn't about fighting wolves. It was about survival, and what gets to you when you're in this situation . Many ignorant people call it an ""unreal movie"" and stupid ending, but you must be either a jackass or a retarded to say that. The ending scene was actually the most real way the movie could have ended, and Carnahan delivered the message correctly; FIGHT TO THE END.What a great movie.",The Grey
787,trojantroy,"If you hate this movie, you clearly missed the point.",10,27 January 2013,"Man, I hate January movie trailers. They try to make everything look like an action movie. When I saw this movie the first time with my friends, I was expecting Taken with wolves. I'm pretty sure that that's what everyone was expecting, considering the fact that I loved the ending and my friends hated it because ""we didn't get to see Liam Neeson fight the alpha wolf."" I'm just going to make this clear for you guys, this is NOT a movie about fighting wolves. This is a movie about fighting personal demons (although yes, they do fight wolves). And from that perspective, it was one of the best movies of 2012. Why it was released in January, where studios release movies that they are embarrassed about, I have no idea. This should have been released in December of 2011 and SWEPED the Oscars. Great acting, amazing cinematography, great directing, superb script writing, an awe-inspiring soundtrack that still gives me chills, and a BADASS open-ended ending. Very rarely do you have endings like this that say, ""Well, here's all the clues. What do YOU think happened?"" It is so refreshing, mostly because 10 people could walk out of this movie with completely different ideas about what happened. Die he live or did he die? Does he believe in God now or is he still atheistic? Were his companions really there or was he the only survivor and imagined that they were there? (When I heard that question, my mind fried like an egg) But of course this movie came out in January, a time of year where ""thinking movies"" are non- existent. People went in expecting a survival story about people fighting hoards of wolves, and instead got a movie with deep characters and layers (I don't know what the guy who wrote ""This is the worst nature movie ever"" was expecting. Get with the program kid, there's more to this movie than the wolves. Nobody really cares about the Animal Planet aspect of this). Anyway, long story short, The Grey is one of the most underrated movies of all-time. If you haven't seen it yet GO DO THAT RIGHT NOW! If I could give this movie more stars, then I would.

Giving this movie anything below a 7 is in my opinion, read that once more, MY opinion, would be a damn shame).The movie was well acted (Liam Neeson stole the show), well directed where in some parts of the movie I felt chills running through my spine, well portrayed, and had a well written story.

Don't know what u have seen on discovery channel but I live in Finland and our north and east are both wolf country, so I think I can share something here bout wolves. Wolf is one of the most misunderstood animals and these kind of movies are just the thing needed to keep the fairy tales alive!At the wilderness wolf does not pose danger to humans!!! They keep their distance and avoid contact. They are also A LOT smaller than in the movie. In Finland wolves tend sometimes attack livestock or dogs but there has been no human casualties for hundred of years or more! Wolves are like wild dogs. Every wild animal is always wild and needs to be considered with respect but it just might be that normal dogs in our cities are more dangerous than wolves. Next movie could be about a bus crash in New York where a bunch of people run from killer dogs and cats lol :DSo its not fare to make a monster out of a peaceful animal!

THat's really all it is. If you have an unnatural hatred of those who make your life easier, than you will love this movie. It is complete fantasyland of gore and violence against the biggest bad guys in the universe. *spoiler* The movie opens with oil workers behaving like vikings, complete with unattractive women, ugly men, bar fights, vomit, and self inflicted violence. In order to create an emotional tie to Liam's character, the story has him attempt suicide, only to be 'talked out of it' by the wolves.For the rest of the movie, the oil workers behave badly so you don't mind when they die.There is really nothing left to say about this, bad plot, bad theme, complete with bad acting. The trailers were completely misleading (no action here) just pathetic drama between Neeson and his dream wife that he is for some unknown reason not with.

Luckily my GF has a weird sense of humour and laughed a lot. Even better was that this was her pick, so I got no blame. Mostly she reacted to the ""Frankenwolfs"" and the illogical decisions the characters made. I myself am still a bit bitter that we went. Ten lines is much much too much trouble to fill for a film like this, but here I'm just adding words to fill up the space. What else... Oh yes, the wolves do not attack grown up people. There has been some cases ages ago where small children have been attacked and those wolves have most likely been partly dogs (makes them unpredictable).

793,reidy97,I sense a bit of bias in the air...,9,2 June 2012,"Lets start by dealing with the elephant in the room. Is the movie realistic? And honestly, what I say cannot change what you are going to think. Trust yourself or trust some person over the internet you have never met before? Sounds like a simple choice to me. But I'm going to review the movie as it should be reviewed. As a movie.So, was it entertaining? Spectacularly so! The only slow part of the film I could pick out is the very start but that was necessary for a back-story to the main character so it would be unfair to dismiss it on that basis.How was the acting? At the start of the movie you already know that even if the supporting cast is awful Liam Neeson will be enough to carry the film through. And although Liam Neeson portrayed his character, Ottway, brilliantly the supporting cast were no push overs. To keep this review brief a star pick would be Frank Grillo as the, ""Douche turned guy you quite like"".Behind the camera. You could show this film to a 5 year old (although I wouldn't recommend it, gore and all that) and the youngster would, I guarantee you be more scared by the sound rather than the actual wolves, so I tip my hat to the sound designers. Speaking of which the actual wolves don't look that spectacular apart from the (SPOILER ALERT) alpha male at the end. The CGI in general is just plain poor which unfortunately lost it a star. But the cinematography managed to hide this fairly well by only giving you glimpses and shaky shots of the wolves.Summary. STOP, re-adjust your mindset now.

Go into this film expecting a gripping, fully fleshed out story which by the end will have you gripping the edge of your seat N.B The plane crash scene is totally bad-ass!",The Grey

795,don_liston,Fatally Flawed Film,1,18 May 2012,"I have lived in Alaska for over 50 years including having worked in the oilfields and traveling to every remote airstrip that we could put a plane down on. This is the worst writing I have ever seen for a film that convinced a financing agency to authorize production. The film was NOT shot in Alaska or even CLOSE to Alaska. Southern Canada is beautiful country but diametrically opposed to what the Alaskan environment is like. The writer here did NOT research; the production company had no idea of what the Arctic is in reality. There are NO TREES, NO MOUNTAINS and nothing like the scenes that are shown in this movie. The men and women who work in our oilfields are not allowed to drink alcohol while they are on their work locations. There are NO bars. Some people do, indeed smuggle alcohol into their quarters, but most of the people forego drinking until they get away from the work location. Our oilfield workers are the same as most places around the world, experienced and careful in a fairly dangerous worksite. Any oilfield crew today would have a diverse group of people from around the world. There are NO high powered rifles near the worksites for a number of reasons. One of the reasons is that all of them are literally ""game reserves"" and your best chance of seeing Alaska's far north wildlife is in the ""oil patch."" The other writers who describe wolf behavior are right on target. If you are lucky enough to live in a national or state park, you may actually see a wolf from time to time. If you working in these areas and filming or happen to be a biologist, you may see most of Alaska's game animals. We do have ONE recorded incident in Alaska of a fatality that was concluded to be by a wolf. Apparently Canada also has one also. The highest number of accidental fatalities in Alaska is invariably from airplanes, but not large planes with commercial airlines. They are from hunters who overload their planes with moose or caribou meat or weather related like the recent charter that killed Senator Ted Stevens.I have always thought that Liam Neeson was a very good actor. I have no idea why he is in a movie without a viable plot, without a story that is so far from reality. This was neither filmed in Alaska nor does it represent anything about Alaska. We provide tax breaks for people who want to shoot movies here. Thank goodness this was not done at the expense of the State of Alaska.",The Grey
796,kjcooper17,Disappointing,4,26 May 2012,"I had time to sit down and watch the Grey last night and was pretty disappointed. The plot is scattered and follows little logical progression. Could have been a good movie, instead I felt it was just a bad attempt at a Liam Neeson action film. The movie was intended to create suspense and horror, which it failed to do in full. The movie was not thought out well with regards to physics, hypothermia, exhaustion, etc. Liam Neeson somehow has a bountiful amount of energy for his long endeavor up until the very last scene, despite a lack of almost all essential factors for survival. Overall the movie left me bored and waiting for any form of decent action, which finally had an opportunity to present itself at the end and instead did not occur. Disappointing.",The Grey
797,ddeclue,Do the OPPOSITE!,1,28 May 2012,"Whatever they are doing to survive in this movie you should probably be doing the opposite.1) Wolves are NEVER that large NOR that aggressive. Wolves are afraid of people and fire even in large packs. BEARS on the other hand you should be worried about.2) Never EVER leave the crash site unless your plane ditches in the ocean and sinks. The aircraft has an EPIRB transmitter that will begin transmitting your location the moment it detects a 6G or worse crash. It will survive much higher G impacts than you will so unless it sinks to the bottom of the ocean it WILL be relaying your location to SAR (Search and Rescue). These days there does not need to be a plane overhead – satellites will pick up your crashed EPIRB signal and alert the authorities.3) You should also never leave the crash site because it is visible from the air and easy for SAR to spot in most cases. You on foot however are much harder to find.4) You should also never leave the crash site because it provides you with ready made shelter which you are going to need in an arctic winter.5) The aircraft contains radio transmitters, maps and location equipment which could be useful in figuring out where you are and calling for help. 6) The aircraft contains supplies for survival. DON'T leave the aircraft!7) Guns will not break that easily in a plane crash. Sorry but that is just ridiculous. Even if they did a broken or empty gun still makes an excellent club.6) Learn what pressure points are and how to stop arterial bleeding Liam! Don't let people bleed out like that.7) The things you need in arctic survival are: deal with medical emergency first, shelter/heat/fire second, water third, and food fourth. 8) You can build shelter from snow – ever hear of an igloo Liam?9) Trees actually help camouflage the wolves by breaking up their silhouettes. You are better off in a wide open space where they cannot sneak up on you.10) Never ever try to cross a 1,000 ft deep gorge on a rope made from sweaters in someone's luggage. You are going to die.11) Don't clod through 2 foot deep snow if you have a knife – make yourself some SNOW SHOES from tree branches.12) If you are going to be in an airplane crash movie (Flight of the Phoenix, Castaway, the Grey) please be sure to pack a fully charged GPS, Iridium satellite cell phone, a zippo lighter, a K-BAR knife, appropriate clothing, some water, a Colt 1911 0.45 ACP, a high powered rifle with a scope and some ammo.",The Grey
798,adamszalaimusic,Commonly misunderstood,9,31 May 2012,"Seeing feedbacks and comments about this movie made me seriously doubt whether people completely understood this or not. What exactly do I mean by this?First of all, the movie does not try to be a ""survival/action/thriller/monster movie"". Misleading marketing (trailer, final battle footage shown in clips, trailers etc)generated expectations in the audience which were destined to be unfulfilled. Maybe it had monetary reasons to disguise the movie like that. I think this is the reason behind all the negativity the movie receives.Anyway, in my opinion, this movie was aimed at depicting Ottway's (Neeson) journey. He had lost his wife due to some terminal illness and with that, had lost all hope of ever becoming happy and normal again. Choosing to take the role of the loner wolf hunter on the isolated plant in Alaska, he could not cope with his feelings and the emptiness that's left to him (as the suicide scene clearly indicates). When the plane crashes, some of them survive (or don't, this could be argued as well)and find themselves in a pretty hopeless situation. From then on, the movie focuses on the harsh realization, that it is pretty much over. The acceptance of death. That was what I felt to be the most important message. Accepting that you die and that death is a natural thing, of which we should not be afraid of (""don't be afraid"" line by Ottway's wife near the end). It's never about the wolves and whether they'd attack a person or not (for the sake of the movie and the message, they could be any monsters or creatures or threats, as that's not what matters), it's about the psychological journey and the fight which they put up. The harsh reality that yes, they are going to die. Their lives have come to an end. The struggle is to accept that and for example one character (the one who sat down and called it ""quits"", I don't remember his name) has managed to do so. But the focus is clearly on Ottway. And here is where the most criticized last scene comes in. Ottway slowly and gradually realizes that it's the end, there is no way out of this and he is going to die as well. He cites the poem his father wrote and goes to the ""last good fight he'll ever know"". We all know that he dies, if not in the battle with the alpha wolf, he gets torn apart by the others. It's the end. So for me, the movie delivers a bitter, but also brave message of accepting and facing death (Neeson could have tried to run, probably he would have died that way as well, but instead he went out with a fight).It's a psychological movie and if people start looking at it that way, the whole perception is likely to change, and no longer will they worry about the realism of wolves and environmental circumstances. If they want something like that, go to Discovery Channel. But this is the beauty of it, it's art, you can have different perceptions and interpretations about it.",The Grey
799,kjeffstewart,A rehash of Sands of the Kalahari?,7,4 June 2012,"Having read some of the comments made earlier about this film, especially those picking faults, why can't people just accept that it is just a bit of escapism designed for two hours of enjoyment? Personally, I really enjoyed the film, although it appears to be close to a rehash of a 1965 Stuart Whitman film, 'Sands of the Kalahari' with it's subject matter of 'plane crash in the middle of a harsh terrain - survivalist takes on wild animals' (in this case baboons).There are some differences in SotK in that it has sand and not snow, a love interest, and a twist that the survivalist is actually trying to be the Alpha male himself, but even the last scene (prior to the titles) of The Grey is almost identical to SotK (Neeson v. Alpha Wolf, Whitman v. Alpha Baboon).Both enjoyable films, but Sands of the Kalahari has it for me.",The Grey
800,fastsmiles,Director knows nothing about outdoors,2,4 June 2012,"I am a big fan of Liam and I have seen most of his movies and loved them. I enjoyed his acting in this one as well, but the story is poorly done. It would be more believable if the characters were a bunch of guys from the city that had no experience in the woods. Liam's character makes all the wrong decisions when it comes to survival. Throwing away his rifle is stupid. It is not damaged badly enough to discard and even if it were damaged more than it appeared to be, it would still be easier to fix it at the crash site than make bang sticks out of wood and tape. It would be a better club than anything they used. It is never explained why he has shotgun shells with him and no shotgun.  This movie needed a technical adviser very badly. It seems to have been done by someone who knows nothing about guns or survival.  If the goal of the movie was to depress the audience and alienate anyone that knows the outdoors, then it succeeded",The Grey
801,cloudpierre,really good thriller,9,12 June 2012,"This movie was enjoyable from beginning to end. It really made you feel the dread and hopelessness that the characters were experiencing. I have not felt that immersed in a movie in a long time regardless of ""how realistic"" it was. People giving this movie a 1 or 2 rating are simply people who think they're too cool and find it easier to join the hate wagon than to have a mind of their own. There were quite a few scenes that had me uneasy with fear. For example : one where the cliff gives way and you can see the ground hundreds of feet below you, one where someone is bleeding out, and one where a character falls from a tree. The movie/director executed these scenes flawlessly and really leave the viewer feeling like the events are happening to them. As a psychological thriller this movie definitely succeeded.Overall it's not an amazing movie but it definitely stands on its own and it executes certain things better than any movie I've seen in recent memory, or ever. 8.9/10 or B+",The Grey

This movie is not a documentary on wolves or survival, IT WASN'T MEANT TO BE REALISTIC. It's about life and death, it's about our constant denial that death looms over every one of us and nothing we do no matter how hard we try it will come. SO the wolves represent death, OK?

The plot itself is just, well, awful! It's as if a bunch of script writers got asked to write the worst possible film of all time and donkeys turd was employed to direct it.All I took away from this film is that wolves will 'F*** you up!', and if your plane crashes in snow then you might have a chance of surviving... yea right! The rest is just heavy breathing, bad acting and pointless cut-a-ways.The only film I can even put in the same bracket of 'awfulness' as this film is 'Cube 2' (don't get me started on).

But, wait a minute! These wolves don't act like wolves, and unless I missed somethinglike some back plot where an evil genius created genetically enhanced wolves to enact revenge on the oil industry, or perhaps shape- shifting bloodthirsty aliens that look like wolves who came into the Alaskan wilderness to run psychological terror research. (Either is acceptable compared to what this film tries to make you swallow.) Honestly, I just could not get past the basics. First off: These wolves look unrealistic; something a freshman high school student would create using a cheap photo shop program. The wolves are bizarre. They ignore easy pickings. Why not eat a dozen or more of the recently dead bodies from the plane crash? Nope. The wolves choose to attack the group of large male adults who possess makeshift clubs, shotgun shell poke sticks and adrenaline fired strength. Why? These men are in their territory. I could almost hear John Rambo echoing in the wolves' exaggerated snarls. Well, okay then...maybe I could forgive that, but then there are the incredible scenes where the characters fall into freezing water and come out soaked, only to miraculously dry off without hypothermia. The pain of this film is constant, ending with a scene of glass shards being taped to the main character's hands to fight the wolves, Thai Boxer style.

However, nuclear threats, terrorists, end-of-the-world scenarios, and zombies just aren't enough to scare people, I guess. We have to once again resort to demonizing anything with teeth and strength greater than our own. Because, no, stranded plane survivors would not be hunted down by wolves in Alaska. Wolves do not kill people who come too close to their dens. Wolves do not ""send in"" omega wolves to get killed for the benefit of the pack. And wolves do not have one alpha in a pack (they have an alpha pair that are the parents or siblings of the others). But then, there isn't night and day in Alaska in the middle of the winter, either (which the movie portrays). It is so far north, it's dark all the time.Yes, people, wolves are ferocious but we aren't on their menu! Not that they might not chomp on some dead bodies, though not as fast as a few hours after a plane comes down. There are plenty of moose in Alaska and there are mice and other rodents for wolves to eat. There would not have been such a big pack (as shown in the movie) if there weren't adequate food.Watch ""Never Cry Wolf"" based on a book by Farley Mowat, rather than this poor excuse of a movie.

The acting is great, and the filming is done just as well. But this is all that this film as to offer.Now for the first on this films list of problems. This film is extremely unrealistic, the idea that a lone Woolf let alone a pack of wolves would attack a group of people is just not going to happen. This movie could have done far better if they focused more on the what was required to survive the elements.The last issue with this movie is by far its worse, this movie pits a group of plane crash survivors against a pack of wolves. One by one the survivors fall victim to the wolves in a desperate attempt to get out of the Alaskan wilderness and in the end not even the lead character Ottway can escape his fate. With this ending the viewer is left with nothing but a feeling of emptiness.This movie is set up for greatness but with its Hollywood theatrics taking the better of it even in its final moments they manage to ruin what could have been a great tail of survival against nature by making the characters lives as meaning less without reason to live.

I personally think that this role could not have been played better by any other actor. After the A-Team(which I really enjoyed) I was expecting something better from Carnahan, and he didn't disappoint.I watched this movie with a friend and at some points we were both gripping our seats and were on the very edge of them.

His character carries the whole film and gives 'The Grey' a depth and meaningfulness that would have been absent without him. Everything you can expect to see in a survival movie is present, casualties of weather/hunger and the menacing wolves that stalk and prey the men in a cat and mouse game.The film delivers action, horror and heart and cleverly builds up tension and fear while questioning the meaning of life and survival which hits a nerve and makes you feel for the characters. The film delivers beautiful yet terrifying imagery along with creepy audio that creates an unsettling atmosphere which is just as terrifying as when the wolves come to attack.The trailer may have misled a few into believing the film would play out like a typical action thriller with Neeson as a macho action hero like he did in such films as 'Taken' but 'The Grey' is much more then that as the men are vulnerable and weak which makes this film incredibly moving and thought provoking.Some have stated that the wolves looked too big and ridiculous in this movie. This is not true the wolves look very realistic with a mix of live animals, animatronics and a little CGI which works well as we are never given too much or too little of the wolves.The ending may not be to everyone's taste but I believe if there would have been a bloodthirsty showdown at the end it would have ruined the film and made it cheesy. Sometimes we as viewers don't need to be baby fed; it's nice to use your brain and imagination once in a while to make up your own assumptions.The Grey is one of, if not the best survival/man vs. nature films I have ever seen and I highly recommend it, its brilliant!For Horror/Thriller news and reviews visit here http://horrorland87.tumblr.com/ or add us on facebook http://www.facebook.com/HORRORLANDHORROR",The Grey

Yes i agree, but its a movie, Just like most horror movie it is unrealistic. Its a fantastic story, a great plot, good acting and good camera work. Its not a documentary so don't judge it but how plausible it is. How good would the movie be if the Wolfs were scared and acted like they would of in real life? It would just be a normal story of survival in the Snow. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, it drew me in and i was almost upset at the end.

This is the first ever Open Road Films film.The Grey stars the great Liam Neeson as Ottway, him and his research team end up crashing out of the sky and into a world filled with wilderness and danger. I know wolves don't really act this way towards humans however...if you landed in the middle of their den? You can't tell me they wouldn't be protective and hostile. Also did you see the landscape? Not a lot of meat out there for the carnivorous wolves. I'm just saying it works for the movie.I saw this 3 times in the theater. My little brother and I were flat-out blown away by this film. This is one of the greatest of all time. I mean that sincerely, I've seen all the ""Great films of history"" and I have to say this is in the top 50.Pulp Fiction is my favorite and maybe it always will be, but so far this year the closest I've seen a movie coming to this is Prometheus. Needless to say it's a good year for Ridley Scott. If you are into the artsy melodrama films or are a PETA die hard supporter, then that will probably effect your judgment on this. I'm not saying it's wrong to be in PETA or to be a fan of the artsy films. I'm just saying it will effect your judgment.The Grey is a masterpiece, a true work of art. Ian Mackenzie Jeffers wrote the original short story called ""Ghost Walker"" and he did screenplay with Director Joe Carnahan. This film was shot in 30 days.30 days! For me, this film is the best survival movie of all time. I've heard people criticize it and call it unrealistic but honestly none of us know how we would deal with that situation until it happened to us.What if the local wolves are hungry and starved and humans land in there den, you've got human blood and dead flesh, breakfast to a wolf.

816,joerlyon,A movie loaded with IRONY,8,9 September 2012,"First of all, the movie is dark. And I like dark movies.It begins with Liam contemplating/attempting suicide. So, from the start I thought his life was over anyway. He was interrupted by a howling wolf.The rest of the story continues, and yes, is a severe suspension of reality.HOWEVER, I found it surprisingly sad how strange the movie paralleled real, strange, and devastatingly random events that happened in Liam's real life. Two years ago, his wife died while snow skiing. She reportedly struck her head on a tree and at the time of the accident she said she was OK. Later that night she developed a terrible headache, fell unconscious and died. If that was a movie review people would post a list a reasons why that was medically impossible- yet it happened in real life.MOVIE SPOILER ALERT: In the movie, a man was cut in half at the torso, and the man next to him survived. A man that fell behind the group was killed by wolves so fast that no one could save him. The black guy was having trouble breathing because of hypoxia, awoke in his sleep by sleep-talking, and never woke up. The man afraid of heights fell to 30 feet and was attacked by the wolves that in his concussed state imagined the hair of the wolf was the hair of his daughter. Another man just gets tired and sits down and quits. But the most ironic of all, a man drowns with his nose and mouth just scant inches away from the surface.I think the movie demonstrated one important thing: in life, weird stuff happens. And sometimes people die from it.The movie had its faults for sure. But I thought it was unpredictable in the randomness.but for me, knowing that Liam had lost his wife, the scene where he is yelling at God...good chance it wasn't acting.",The Grey

The storyline itself is interesting and there was so much potential for suspense and drama but in the end I was left rather uninspired and let down.I found the context of the plot to be poorly detailed for several reasons. The main reason being that if you are being stalked/hunted by a pack of murderous wolves, why would you:1) Have no weapons in your hands for self-defence? 2) Have large gaps between each person, making it easy for the wolves to pick off the last man? 3) Walk without having look outs in each direction to ensure you're not being circled?So for me, despite moments of intensity the film was rather limp with insufficient focus on the details and I found a lot of it implausible.Thanks james",The Grey

820,SPreston000,I'd like to shed some positive light on this movie.,8,25 September 2012,"I had to create an account to give my two cents. Some of these reviews are downright harsh. If you are on the fence about screening this movie, I'd like to let you know about my personal experience. (With that being said, my review does contain spoilers so be aware.)It's not often for me to be truly emotionally invested in a movie. But this one struck me. Liam Neeson's acting was amazing. His character had a lot of depth simply from the look in his eyes; I could empathize with him. The things he experienced, the friends and love he lost, his fight to survive.. he held my attention until the very end. In addition, several scenes in the movie brought me to tears. When a movie can bring that kind of emotion out of me, AND more than once, then I say it was a job well done. This movie may have unrealistic scenarios regarding survival, wolf behavior and so on.. but so what? We don't watch movies expecting to see an hour and a half of reality. We watch them to be enthralled into another world or story that is not our own. If you want to watch something that is that accurate, watch a documentary.Also.. just because you don't know what EXACTLY happens to Ottway in the end is no reason to throw this movie completely under the bus. Several movies have done this before: Inception, Vanilla Sky, Drive, etc. I realize you may be on the edge of your seat and wanted some kind of relief at the end; we all like a conclusion to what we just invested time into. But I enjoy having the decision to be my own. I'd like to think optimistically about what happens to Ottway. Maybe he kills the alpha. Maybe that tracking watch works and he is found. It's YOUR choice.All I have to say is, I have watched this movie twice now. I enjoyed it. Maybe you will too.Also, wait until the very end of the credits for a little something extra. Happy movie watching. -S",The Grey

Then he took them into the woods? Really?! Wolves thrive in the woods! My thoughts were.... stay near the plane, collect supplies, move the dead far away and burn them, make some makeshift weapons for protection, have 2 on night duty,... I will definitely NOT recommend this movie to anyone. I love Liam Neeson, but I would Not watch it a second time. Spoiler - no one makes it out alive. That's the SUCKY part! Not one person!!

822,diane-simmons,Where to begin?,1,29 September 2012,"This movie was utterly ridiculous. First of all, the F-bombs were enough to keep the mute button on half the time. Since there wasn't much meaningful conversation, anyway, we didn't need to hear so much gratuitous cussing. Spoiler alerts - On the plane, everyone's breath is visible, yet no one is concerned? The main character buckles himself in - with 2 seat belts - but somehow they come undone and he's freed while the other guy on the ground is still stuck in his. They don't utilize parts of the plane to make adequate shelter, or go through suitcases for supplies, or try to find a beacon, black box, or radio device. One minute the wind is whistling loudly, and the next minute you can hear a pin drop like it's a cool spring day. Wolf eyes appear out of nowhere like a bad take on a scene from Sesame Street. The wolves are so unrealistic as to be an insult to the animal kingdom. A guy breaks his knee and no one makes a splint or even a walking stick? The ending - omg - what can I say? Just when it's about to get exciting, the screen goes black! WTH - it's the end of the movie! Everyone dies! Well, that's not depressing. I don't know about everyone else, but I spend money on movies so that I can feel good at the end of it.

823,ashley-lynn_wilson,Unrealistic? So What?,8,3 January 2013,"I personally loved this movie and not because it was anywhere realistic, but because it was entertaining. I was ENTERTAINED while watching this film which I'm pretty sure was the whole intent. Yes yes, people we hear you when you go on about how dumb it was with the wolves acting the way they did and that it's not at all how they really behave and yes we hear you when you bash every small detail on their survival skills. We get it okay? you don't think it's realistic. However for an action packed movie with Liam Neeson a little bit of fiction is alright, why not let your mind wander. Without these fictionally events in the movie, you wouldn't have The Grey at all. It be a group of guys who died from lack of warmth,food and shelter or maybe they would've been saved if they stayed near the crash? Yes, probably but you wouldn't have AN ACTION PACKED MOVIE TO WATCH. This is Hollywood not Geographic, I personally don't think it was really meant to be all that real but to give it's audience a thrill. If you want an exciting adventure/thriller movie the Grey gives you that. You just to put it out of your mind that you're not going be watching a documentary.",The Grey
824,jkfw-502-213232,Watch The Edge instead.,3,14 October 2012,"Heard lots of great things, lived up to none of them. There wasn't even great scenery in the movie, there was some sure, but not enough given where it was supposed to be. This movie was basically The Edge; only with wolves. The whole movie I kept thinking are these wolves supposed to be super-smart, telepathic wolves? Why are they so angry? The movie would have set up a much better plot if it left out the sad sap story with his wife or whatever, and some oil company hired him to come up and deal with an unusual pack of vicious wolves. Not ""ok we crashed, survived and now there are really mean wolves out there for some reason"". If you want a great, intense, scary stranded airplane crash with crazy animals eating the crap out of everyone, watch The Edge. Somehow the bear is much more believable and terrifying (then you find out all the stunt scenes were real ass scenes done with a real ass Kodiak Bear named Bart and it's even scarier. No pansy CGI. There is no ""hey logging crews"" then they all forget and cross a bottomless pit which apparently the wolves flew over. No random wolves chasing them which suddenly go away when they go into the river. Last, but there is no f-ing boxing match with a wolf that doesn't actually happen (which would have totally redeemed this movie). In short, watch The Edge instead.",The Grey
825,sonicmetroidlink,"Frostbite, Wolfbite, and Liam Neeson",8,31 October 2012,"You're abandoned and lost on top of a snowy mountain somewhere in Alaska with no sign of civilization for miles around. You feel the sharp sting of the freezing wind as it relentlessly blows right through you and your tattered clothes. You haven't eaten for what feels like weeks and your body feels like it's just a couple of degrees away from complete hypothermia. How could this possibly get any worse? Oh whoops, I forgot to mention the pack of hungry, snarling wolves that are constantly hunting you down. This is the sense of fear and helplessness that director Joe Carnahan instills in the viewers of his movie The Grey.With such an intense scenario, it would be obvious that an equally intense actor be required to fill the role of John Ralph Ottway, the protagonist. Actor Liam Neeson is brought in to fulfill this role perfectly. Neeson has a plethora of intense action/thriller films already under his belt (Taken, The A-Team, The Dark Knight Rises) and The Grey is a welcomed fit into his lineup. We are introduced to Neeson's character, a toughened loner with a broken heart, on the brink of committing suicide, haunted by memories of his ex-wife. With the barrel of his rifle in his mouth, he decides at the last second to keep living. With his demons silenced for the time being, he boards a small airplane along with some of his oil refinery coworkers, most of whom are happy to be returning home from the Alaskan cold. Following some turbulence, every nervous flyer's worse nightmare comes true in one of the most terrifying crash scenes ever seen on film. Ottway, the only one able to remain composed, takes charge of the other seven survivors. Although they are all stranded out in the middle of nowhere in a snowstorm, the men are willing to remain hopeful. That is until they discover that they've landed in the territory of a pack of wolves, and the wolves want them gone. What follows is a thrilling and suspenseful tale of survival that is sure to keep viewers on the edge of their seat. The Grey certainly does a lot of things right in order to capture and maintain that certain scary, suspenseful air throughout the entirety of the film. Director Carnahan does a good job of fleshing out the backstories of each survivor through strong dialogue and backstory development. Moments of peace are often abruptly ended by a wolf attack when you least expect it, and every time another survivor is killed off you feel for them. The constant tension and fear of death lingers throughout every moment of the movie. Even when the men are sitting around a warm campfire, the glow of the wolves' menacing yellow eyes that dance in the darkness just out of reach of the campfire light serves as a constant reminder that at any given moment the men are being watched. While the tension and suspense of The Grey is spot on, there are a few weak points in the film. The pattern of relaxed moments punctuated by sudden scenes of fear definitely does the job of catching viewers off guard, however it can be a bit formulaic, as this is a strategy employed by many other directors and movies, albeit that few do it as well as The Grey. Another point of weakness in the movie is its realism. Experts on wolf pack behavior, for example, may be disappointed with the portrayal of the CGI wolves. Also, if you are ever in a plane crash and find yourself abandoned on a snowy mountain top, do not use this movie as a survival guide by any means. In fact, you should probably do the opposite of a lot of the decisions made by Ottway throughout the movie. Although these details might disappoint some viewers, they still contribute to the overall story and feeling of the movie and certainly should not discourage anyone from going to see The Grey.The Grey follows a simple formula, but its execution is absolutely spot on. Few movies can rival the tension and suspense created by Carnahan, and Liam Neeson once again delivers a bone chilling performance complete with emotion and action. I found that The Grey provided me with better scares than any other typical horror film filled with ghosts or ax murders. Complete with stunning visuals, spine- tingling terror, frostbite, wolfbite, Neeson being a total bad-ass, and more suspense and tension than you could shake a stick at, The Grey is the complete package that I would highly recommend any movie goer to go see.",The Grey
826,kberends1979,My synopsis,9,16 November 2012,"All in all, ""The Grey"" is a phenomenal movie. It has all of the suspense of a disaster survival movie, with the occasional subtle character building hints, which add a strong sense of depth & realism to the movie. The Grey provides an added emotional drama aspect to the movie as it does a really good job of portraying the sense of determination, desperation and teamwork. I found that over the course of the movie I even cared what happened to some of the characters I didn't like at the start of it.The language even for an R flick may be a bit excessive to some viewers, and the various disaster & calamity scenes may be too graphic for even some adult audiences. The suspense factor of the movie is solid throughout once the story 'takes off'. It would appear that they really put some thought into this one, & I would recommend it to most adult viewers, especially those with a trained eye for subtle plot intricacies.",The Grey
827,bhoelle,"Van-Halen, NOT Van-Hagar!",10,20 November 2012,"Let's just say, this movie was awful. I mean, how could it possibly be enjoyable if it isn't realistic? Thats why I LOOOOVE Star Wars so much. It don't get no more real than that! I hate all movies that play on emotions and philosophical themes like death and existentialism. Come on! Boooring. I like to L-O-L when I see crappy actors like Liam Neeson on the big screen. (I also think Nickleback is the best and Kid Rock RULLES!) I wanted to see wolves killing people and I got it. I love watching movies where people die in survival situations, but I hate it when it makes me question my own (inevitable) death. I don't wanna think about that sh**! I mean, why didn't they just have little baby wolves burst out of the chests of the survivors. THAT I would have watched.Liam Neesum sucks. He's a terrible actor. I think Adam Sandler is waaaaay better. He should totally win a Grammy for his acting, or whatever it is. The only people that would ever like The Grey are foreigners, or terrorists - or worse: Foreign Terrorists! In fact, I'd go so far as to say this movie is so unrealistic its UN-American. If you like it, you're a terrorist. All these characters are dumb. They don't act like men. Men would kick those wolves in the nuts and then rip their heads' off with their own hands! YEAH! But these guys? They talk about MacGyver so why doesn't they just fashion a bomb out of the wreckage and blow up all the wolves?? O-M-G. I can't believe people actually have differing opinions than mine and LIKE this movie! Gawd. I just wanna scream because this movie sucks so bad. The trailer made me think it would be an awesome action thrill ride, but now that it didn't turn out like that I feel entitled to have my way, just like with everything in life. I'm afraid of thinking deeply about my own personal choices so I tend to discredit people who do by throwing facts and figures at them, usually ones I gather from the only TRUE source for nature facts: The Discovery Channel. Duh. *******If any of this made you angry, then ignore the nay'sayers and just see the film. Its a wonderful parable of the human will to live when all hope is lost. To struggle in life for struggle's sake. To fight when you no longer have a reason to live. Anyone with half a brain can look past the inaccuracies and accept the film for what it is. But not everyone will agree. Because it takes a strong sense of self to accept that perhaps you, too, can be afraid of death.",The Grey
828,gumenski,Another Unsatisfying drama,3,20 November 2012,"Once again, another emotion-fishing desperation of a flick based on the vast perversion of reality involving our wolf friends to the north. Very, very little about this fictional drama is true-to-life and even when wielding the power of distorted truth, the writers still couldn't find a way to keep this movie entertaining.Boring, predictable, unsatisfying. I was expecting some form of plot twist or surprise ending to throw me off the track I had been riding safely on since the initial opening scene. I can't name one event in the entire movie that interrupted my boredom and caught me off guard. Hollow story aside, even with a very mild grasp of true mother nature it is nevertheless quite obvious how much of an exploitation of wolves this fairy tale really is. One need only to have watched any of dozens of respectable documentaries in their lifetime (such as http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWmOtXSAr1M) to obtain a grasp of how the species thinks and operates. Reality is simply nothing like the exploitation that The Grey has provided.I was excited to watch this yet found the movie both disrespectful of truth as well as my intellect and wouldn't even recommend it as a cheap rental. Simply embarrassing and fruitless unless you're hellbent on watching for the sake of viewing another Liam Neeson performance.",The Grey

830,peterse4,Stupid,2,10 July 2013,"*****Spoilers***** I'll give this 2 stars just because there's one good scene (""you're going to die...""). Other than that, it's pretty stupid.No shelters were constructed in the entire running time of this movie. That alone tells you this film has nothing to do with survival. Sleeping outside IN THE SUMMER is cold enough without a shelter; in wintry Alaska it's suicide, and none of them would have lived the night.The wolves are totally unrealistic both in appearance and deed; giving them 3 heads and demon eyes would have been more realistic.Other reviews claim it is about existentialism, or the search for meaning in death... but if that's the case, why would people listen to a suicidal nutjob tell them to jump off a cliff or run into the woods away from their only chance at rescue? They even left the site of their one piece of food (the dead wolf) for no apparent reason. The tragedy in this movie is almost entirely self-imposed because none of it had to happen save for the plane crash itself.So, how philosophical can a film get about survival when the characters are actively killing themselves? It can talk about suicide, but that's about it; and the only reason they gave for not doing it is having an external enemy to fight, which is a pretty poor reason.So yeah, it fails on all levels, both realism and philosophy. If you just wanted cinematography, just watch a friggin David Attenborough documentary. At least you wouldn't be brain-dead by the end of it.",The Grey
831,jeffevans20122012,To the people that did not understand the point of this movie,7,26 December 2012,"The movie presents a point of view that is both disturbing and thought provoking. People may or may not believe the messages presented in this movie, but it is sure to get people thinking about them. This movie goes above and behind the normal survival flick, and Liam Neeson executes the part magnificently.I must warn readers that I plan to reveal some important parts of the movie, but it is necessary in order to explain the main ideas behind the movie. If you have not seen the movie yet, go watch it. If you don't understand the main ideas or feel like you missed something, come back and read this review.The first idea of the movie is basically this: It is implying that life and death are pretty much random. Nature is not selective in how people die and when they die. It seems to be pretty much up to chance when and how it happens. Whether a person is righteous or not, religious, or even important to others, death can happen at any time and even in horrible ways. Nature is neither merciful or merciless. It is just nature.As a result of this, the movie itself questions whether God is real. The movie shows that God does not seem to be taking an active role in our lives and how things play out. Throughout the movie, the men are shown praying and asking God to bless the fallen men around them and to show the remaining men mercy. By the end of the movie, Ottway, played by Liam Neeson, is the only one left alive. He looks up at the sky and says something along the lines of ""f*** faith. Show me a sign."" To his dismay, he shortly after walks directly into the heart of the wolf den. The movie implies that this occurred solely by chance. God did not get involved. Of course, there are people that would say that the way things occur in real life is all part of God's plan, but that is not the message of the movie.The movie takes this idea even further by questioning whether our consciousness or spirit lives on after we die. Diaz, one of the remaining men left alive after the plane crash, represents this pessimistic point of view. His view point is that we basically cease to exist after we die.These two ideas make the final idea that much more disturbing and depressing. The movie implies that God may exist or is, at the least, not intervening in our lives, and also, that there is a possibility that we cease to exist after we die. However, the movie also shows that people grow strong emotional bonds with one another. Throughout the film, flash backs of more peaceful times of Ottway with his past wife are shown. Stories are also told throughout the movie of the other characters with their loved ones.The movie is presenting a disturbing question, if God may not be real and we cease to exist after we die, then why must we feel such strong emotional bonds for each other, emotions which feel very real and meaningful to us, but we just die and cease to exist anyway? It is very depressing idea indeed.Of course, the movie could also be saying that we live on in our children/successors, but in the movie, Ottway's wife is already dead, so this is a dubious possibility.The ideas presented in this movie are both disturbing and depressing. However, the movie does a great job of doing what it sets out to do, to get people thinking about life and death. We could all die today and everything we ever knew and thought to be meaningful could become absolutely nothing and meaningless. Let us hope that it is not true.",The Grey
832,raphillips-576-790534,Totally Different Take on the Plot,3,7 January 2013,"In the final hospital scene with the wife, my son pointed out that the IV drip was on Liam's side of the bed. That means the wife was telling him not to be afraid to die, and the whole wolf thing was a delirious dream. That made the unrealistic wolf chase scenes make a lot more sense. The title of the movie, ""The Grey"", would then refer to the semi-conscious state between life and death.This could have been a real ""Sixth Sense"" moment if the previous story hadn't been so unenjoyably unrealistic. Between the blazing sticks that they used for torches (try that one at home), to the clichéd circling wolves, running at their heels, but nowhere to be seen while the men got a fire started, to the commercial jet apparently without a black box, none of it made any sense, even with a heavy suspension of disbelief. If it was all a deathbed dream, it somehow almost forgives the lack of realism, because dreams can be unrealistic.",The Grey

Absolutely horrible, I can't even finish watching it because its so stupid. There's no way a wolf would attack in any of those circumstances. Wolves do not try to get even either. Everything else about the movie is decent, except for how the actors interact with each other, all the men act like nothing is as serious as it actually is. Way too many sad flashbacks.

You don't see people complaint about the lack of realism in The Lord of The Rings. There is a big difference between the two but the premise relates in the fact that it isn't intended to be realistic. This movie is more of a visual poem than an action film. Everything about it is essentially solid. There are a lot of things in it that are not realistic but that isn't important. Giant man eating wolves may be irrational, but I don't see a problem with that in a fictional film. The wolves aren't even the main point of the film. It is survival. Life. This film has an incredibly deep meaning that many people cannot comprehend. They don't understand. This movie is about struggling to survive on both sides. Even death is a main point of this film.

The wolves never ate a thing - they were basically murderers in furry clothing. I agree with all of the bad reviews here. The fact that they left the scene of the plane wreckage (where they had partial shelter and fire), was the first big anomaly and it got worse from there....why would anyone venture out into open space in three feet of snow if they were being stalked by 'viscous' wolves? Even if they were not, would they not have frozen to death? They did not have that much clothing. The stupidest part is when the main character falls in the river and he comes out, all wet, and in the next scene he is all dry. How the heck did that happen? Wouldn't your clothes be like wooden planks? Wouldn't you die straight away? Not worth the time it takes to watch.",The Grey

I was very much looking forward to this film and am a fan of Neeson but this film was a huge letdown. Obviously produced by people with some money but little talent or creativity, give it a miss. If you are interested in intelligent, well made films, again look elsewhere. The film offers nature scenes which are quite nice, fake looking wolves, depressing plots and turns, and many instances of wanting you to suspend belief at all costs.

A lot of people critiqued whether the movie is realistic or not in its portrayal of the wolves behaviour, as well as, the ability to survive the crash and the elements, and I agree from that perspective its not too realistic... people don't survive crashes, let along the elements like the ones shown in this movie.What I did find really, really interesting, was that there is more movie after the credits, and I wondered how many people would have actually sat in a theatre long enough to see it, or sat at home and watched it through to the end of the credits... Luckily enough, I watched it at home, and just left it to run through the credits as I brushed my teeth and got ready for bed.

Your whole 4 out of 10 rating for the movie has absolutely no merit whatsoever. Your facts are all wrong haha. First off, Timberwolves are well over 120lbs, in 2008 the largest Timberwolf registered was 175lbs which looking at the alpha male in this 2011 movie looked pretty realistic to me. Although you are right about your den comment, the fact that you find it incomprehensible that a wolf would attack a group of 3 unsuspecting men clearly shows you know nothing about wolves and are clearly stating your own opinion and not fact. Wolves are predators and just like humans, when they are hungry and need to eat, they will do anything to get their food. In the areas that these movies are shot, these men are in the wild. Not some hiking trail in ""wolf"" country that you travelled in. The wolves weren't luring them into the den, that's where he ended up. I find it funny that you think it was ridiculous the things they did to try and protect themselves.....after a plane crash.....with limited supplies.... I would love to hear your expert advice on back country survival from a plane crash. haha Anyways, I'm not even sure why I'm engaging your horrible review with lacklustre facts about wolves, but the biggest thing to remember is, ITS A MOVIE. 2 thumbs up for The Grey, 2 thumbs down for Mr. Knowsnothingaboutwolves.

Don't listen to the people writing horrible reviews because it is not that bad. On the other hand everyone that is saying it is amazing, it isn't. I'm not going to mention anything that happens in the movie but, some things that happen in the film probably would not go as well as they did in real life.

I think if they wanted to make the people that take this movie super seriously then maybe they should talk to someone about making a Bear Grylls movie. The only thing is, is that no one would watch it because it would be super boring and it wouldn't even have killer wolves.Just go watch movies and remember not to take anybody's word on how good or bad a movie was, unless your best friends are professional movie critics.",The Grey

I did jump in one or two places , but that was it .. I even said to my wife 10 minutes in that it would end up with Neeson and the main wolf in it's den and the film ending with him going toward it and then a black screen .. Way to predictable , very little story line .. In fact ... no story line ..Neeson should have pulled the trigger at the start of the movie and saved us all the time watching .. I had looked forward to watching this .Anyone thinking of going to watch it or buy it on DVD .. Don't . A plane crashes .. People die .. A pack of wolves hunt the 7 survivors .

845,pieguy119,A gripping existential drama,8,26 December 2013,"Most negative reviews of this film seem to center around the unrealistic depiction of wolves or the fact that it was too philosophical and preachy for a survival thriller. I think this completely misses the point. The Grey was not a film about wolves and a plane crash with a philosophical backdrop. It was a philosophical movie with wolves and a plane crash used as a framing device. The themes of hope, doubt, tenacity, perseverance, and determination are what make this movie great. The burning question of what to do when all seems lost and how to keep going when it feels like you're completely alone is very universal and can apply to almost anyone in some form or another. The emotional ride of watching Ottway's and the other survivors' ups and downs is what keeps this movie interesting long after the unrealistic super-wolves lose their luster. This may not be the film you were expecting, but it's a great one none the less.",The Grey

847,bryony-saunders,The Grey,6,6 April 2014,"I'm a fan of Liam Neeson and a fan of Thrillers however not so much a fan of cliché or Hollywood movies. But I think that's what's people are forgetting when watching this film and writing their reviews, it's a typical Hollywood movie! Dramatic plane crash, special effects and lots of drama! And what other role can Liam Neeson play except movie hero. In my opinion, I didn't think this film was excellent but that's purely because It's not my favourite genre in terms of the film itself, the scenery and cinematography is on point and as a viewer you really capture the outlook and feel to what the characters are feeling. It lives up to all expectations I jumped at the points I was supposed to, the wolves genuinely made me change my mind from them being beautiful creatures to quite scary ones. The alternator cutting shots from the quiet to the chaos was great and worked really well. I also liked the connection the director gives us to the main character, we get an insight into his personality. Overall I'd recommend people give it a watch.",The Grey

I refer readers to read Helen Thayer's book of living among wild wolves in Alaska for a more accurate account of wolf behaviors. Also a poor account of how to survive in the wilderness. Who in their right mind would risk life and limb to reach a river, then never drink the water, and fail to follow it downstream?

I thin Mr.LIAM Neesom was perfect for the role of Ottway.I cringed when the plane went bucking and jerking through the storm and felt like I was literally on the plane as it crashed. I could almost feel the terrible cold and the powerful winds. The wolves scared,no terrified me. I would have followed Ottway anywhere because he continually showed knowledge of the wolves and surroundings.I kept hoping somehow they would make it. But, as in life,sometimes we try but not overcome. The scenes with his late wife were sad but, very believable. Mr.Carnahan is to be applauded for his acting as are the other characters in this movie.I was on the edge of my seat throughout this movie.To the naysayers who nitpick this movie,Shame on you!

When I went to see this film, everyone in the cinema was in stitches at how bad the film was, not just me. I don't like to slag Liam Neeson off but the film was just terrible. Shocking story line with no substance and those reviews that say the film explores deep and meaningful ideas are just wrong. The action was rubbish, but the moral explorations were laughable - perhaps this would be a good film to take an 8 year old too but even this is out of the question due to the foul language and violence.

So that could be a rating of 2 to 6,000,000, mother-in-law had seen it and remembered it vividly when local hounds were baying for supper to the concern of my 3 year old - she thought they were wolves (sprog that is)! So, I thought, anything that registers across the generations must be worth a punt.... Lots of flaws if viewed as a documentary but it's not a documentary, so if you view it in that way you're a bit of a tit. Lots of continuity flaws but if you have a few glasses of wine you won't even notice them. Plot has barely one dimension. Characters are not really developed much beyond Chum. Gore factor is scaled back considering plot.(could be Film4 edit though?..) Wolves are shite. Howling is good (hence register with her-in-doors-in-law).

852,davidsw89,An amazing story without waste,10,2 September 2014,"If you don't like thinking, go waste your time, otherwise see this movie. Scenery and contemplation are the theme, all whilst you struggle for hope for the men facing the daunting task of surviving beasts and grueling frozen landscape. The story will take you to the dark side of nature of both men and beasts. Of course if you don't have the guts to face reality I suggest you try it. Animal activists have no clue what animals are like. They grew up with their little pets and never realized wolves are not goldfish. They will kill you if they feel the need to. Fact, wolves when left alone in the wilderness form packs of 40 and up, another fact, people around a wolves den have little to no chance of survival if they don't remove themselves immediately. Lastly packs of this size while less common in modern day do to human intervention range up to 2000 square miles. If you get caught within 50, they will likely kill you for their own safety. That said this story has some truth in it, and if your looking for action beyond another comic book made movie, this is the movie for you.",The Grey
853,lanoueguy,A disturbing allegory,6,27 October 2014,"I can understand how this movie got good box office: a survival flick where every suburban wannabe who maybe plays a game of touch football on Thanksgiving thinks he's still got enough of his youthful Right Stuff to be heroic: 'Yeah, I could to that'. Then there's gorgeous photography, man versus wild without, thankfully, Bear Grylls making them drink their body fluids. And, let's face it, there's Liam Neeson. The kind of guy even young women like a little too much to be a pure father figure; the kind of man's man you feel you could have a beer with and yet have a conversation serious enough to convince you that the Brolove you're feeling isn't about hormones but 'true bonding'. What I don't understand is how the critics took any of this seriously. Let's dismiss the 'hey, this is unrealistic' position. Yeah, it is. In that zone, you don't survive more than a few hours if you don't move. Few people know how this kind of cold is deadly. You fall into the river, you fall unconscious in about 30 seconds; you are inadequately dressed and stop moving, you fall asleep in about half an hour and don't wake up. Then, the wolves. Wolves just don't act like that, except in one scene when the pack divides up and attacks from two directions. Alphas don't 'send' an Omega to see what's up. Wolves don't kill for pleasure or revenge. They are eating machines: smart, really smart eating machines whose true strength is in the pack and in coordinated hunting. An individual wolf couldn't bring down more than a fawn, let alone a human. So, not realistic. We get it. Stop criticising. If, however, we can't take the high road of realism to Critics' Corner, then by default it's supposed to be some sort of allegory? That's what troubles me. Of what, exactly? Certainly not man versus nature. We're far too suburban to have any notion that nature can threaten us. Bonding when threatened? Well, the men do bond, a bit, with the usual ritual challenge to the Alpha male (Neeson) rebuffed with the challenger accepting His Inferior Omega Status (the challenger eventually dies by leaving the security of the group, but, tellingly, this is not a sacrifice to allow others to live; he just can't live with himself knowing that deep down inside he's a Beta). But bonding gets them nowhere: they all die (NOT a spoiler alert; everyone knows this). Then there's the so-called spiritual aspect (in fact, the film was supposedly marketed by pushing this among some Christian groups). This, however, is really sketchy despite what some critics say: Neeson is a wolf-killer by trade (!) with a dying wife; he's on the verge of killing himself. He doesn't, and the crash seems to put him on the road to spiritual re-awakening as he takes care of his little pack of survivors. At the end, he confronts the Alpha wolf, mano a mano. We are left uncertain if he lives or dies in the encounter. Let's suppose he lives. Is this a triumph? They invaded wolf territory; Neeson urges them to leave the wreckage, where wolves would never venture (he's a wolf hunter; you'd think he'd know that). He loses his men one by one. In the end, we don't know if he triumphs. But admitting that he might have done so, the question is, against what? His own bad judgement? His own existential angst? His cowardice in choosing suicide instead of staying by his wife's side? No, this film is an example of pure simulacrum, of alleged values (individualism, heroism, and what passes for altruism – 'you're gonna die; deal with it') completely detached from any reference to the real world. It's as if in post 9-11 America it's enough to manifest heroism without having a real challenge or a real enemy; the rhetoric has gone so far that pretty soon a cop who writes up a traffic ticket will be a hero. Oh, wait! That's the real allegory here. That's the core of this film and the reason for its popularity. Yeah, the guys are heroic enough, if you overlook the fact that they don't take care of each other and let individuals fall behind to get eaten, frozen or drowned (an allegory for Mitt Romney's America?). And I guess there's some sort of triumph at the end, but against an imaginary enemy, a wolf you provoked by invading his territory, a wolf whose behaviour (culture) you failed to respect in your trek to escape by insisting on acting dumb and provocatively. But in the end, these so-called heroics are empty actions: no one wins. The men are dead, the wolf-pack destroyed; worse, the hero is not somehow transcendentally transported to another plane of realisation and existence, as in a Greek tragedy or, for that matter, as in Saving Private Ryan, where at least the notion of sacrifice and abnegation actually leads to bonding AND to self-insight. This movie is perfect for post-Bush America. Thirty years ago right wingers like John Milius and Tom Clancy, clichéd as they might have seemed, presented Americans not only saving America but saving their own humanity in the process; even Conan becomes a wise king at the end (which is what distinguishes a Stephen King horror from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre). Times have changed. Six out of ten for Neeson and the scenery.",The Grey

Suffering comes for no reason, good people suffer, horrible people suffer and the universe has no bias towards making your life enjoyable. I currently suffer from chronic pain in my knee. I can't sit down or stand without pain and the only way I'm not is if I'm lying on my stomach or running (yes, movement is pain free). I can't go out with friends. I can't find a job that will have me. I'm on pain killers every day.

857,wastegimper,"Absurdist cinema. ""Life sucks and then you die, but keep trying anyway"" the movie",9,23 March 2015,"First and foremost, this movie is not trying to be realistic. The wolves aren't real wolves and the film conveys it's message better if they seem like agents of an uncaring universe rather than slightly aggressive huskies. The wolves (IMO) are manifestations of nature's random, inescapable violence and the counterpoint to the beautiful but distant landscapes that the film is shot in. If someone went into this movie expecting realism I can see how they would be blindsided by the allegory and hate it, but if you know not to expect a nature documentary then you won't have any of the same complaints as the 1-star ""this is so unbelievable"" people.This movie is pretty similar to Albert Camus' novel ""The Plague"" thematically, so to avoid spoilers (for the movie) I'm going to copy-paste a Wikipedia excerpt about themes (from the book) that are present in both and just substitute the word ""wolf"" for ""plague""(Quote) ""The ravages of the (wolves and the inhospitable environment) convey the absurdist position that humans live in an indifferent, incomprehensible universe that has no rational meaning or order, and no transcendent God. The (wolves) come unannounced and may strike down anyone at any time. (They are) arbitrary and capricious, and leave humans in a state of fear and uncertainty, which ends only in death. In the face of this metaphysical reality, what must be the response of individuals? Should they resign themselves to it, accept it as inevitable, and seek what solace they can as individuals, or should they join with others and fight back, even though they must live with the certainty that they cannot win? (Joe Carnahan's) answer is clearly the latter. (One character) argues that one would have to be a madman to submit willingly. Rather than accepting the natural order of things — the presence of fear and death — he believes one must fight against them. He is aware of the needs of the community; he does not live for himself alone. When it is pointed out that ""victories will never be lasting,"" he admits that he is involved in a ""never ending defeat,"" but this does not stop him from engaging in the struggle."" (/End quote)The position the characters find themselves in is horrific and bleak, with virtually no chance of escape. If they manage by some miracle to survive the ordeal, they will return to their mundane and unsatisfactory lives to die a slower and less violent, but no more meaningful, death. The actors somehow manage to convey this in subtle mannerisms and seemingly innocuous comments, escaping the melodrama that usually goes with such pessimism.The almost crushing darkness that permeates the movie makes the bright spots shine all the more. Jokes told around the campfire, people swapping stories about growing up or loved ones, overcoming one obstacle among an infinite number; All these things stand out and become more meaningful against the black backdrop. Every little gesture of rebellion against the overwhelming force facing the group feels incredibly significant. Technically the movie is fantastic as well, the shots are all beautiful and the characters all play their parts almost perfectly. Neeson deserves the lead role, and all the supporting actors have fleshed out characters that they portray wonderfully.To summarize: The universe is shouting ""Give up, you can't win"" at Liam Neeson and his merry band of sufferers. He responds with ""yeah, probably"", puts his middle finger up, and keeps walking. It's good, you should probably watch it.",The Grey

Everyone is entitled to their own opinion but sometimes great pieces are dismissed as bad because they either have a very bad advertisement campaign or because they are missing some more obvious clues about what's going on. I believe this is like Interstellar. A movie which theme seams obvious but then turns out it isn't. The movie interstellar wasn't about physics and space. It was about mankind and how fragile and human we are. Same as The Grey. This movie it's not about WOLVES. It is about people. Wolves and the snowy environment are just the background. Liam Neeson did a great part, I really liked his performance. Of course he's not Johnny Depp performing all kinds of different roles in his life but some actors are very good at being versatile and others are very good at certain parts. Liam Nesson made me believe his character was wounded in the heart and that he really loved that woman like fewer other artist could do it. He's passionate and devoted.The wolves are great and the overall ambiance is just terrific. The music isn't bad either and it fits the scenes quite well, I believe. Everyone (I supposed) is informed about what wolves can or can't do in the wild... that was not the point of the movie. They aren't mean creatures, they are just creatures.I believe the wolves were a representation of every fear in our ancient mind. It's like a story being told by someone where the monsters are always bigger than they actually were.

Wolves are shy animals who dislike encroachment of their territory, but will run from it (unless there is a direct threat to themselves or their young). Unlike human beings, they do not find entertainment in killing. They are incredible hunters, and do so for survival, using the pack method....they do not waste food and will hide anything they can't consume right away. They are very social, loving and interactive among themselves. They are highly intelligent, loving parents, incredible survivors. They are hunted beyond belief and for no reason whatsoever, as they pose no threat to people. To represent this animal as a stalker, attacker, or even a risk to hikers is absolute nonsense. Typical of U.S. movie-makers to create yet another threat to innocent animals ! Jaws started the mania for shark hunting and the blood bath continues. Please respect animals and their habitat.

The final scene is in my eyes a masterpiece, as it shows Neeson carefully looking through each man's wallet and showing the audience what is truly important to each of them, and ultimately, to Neeson himself Many of the user reviews here focus on the unrealistic exact presentation of the behavior of wolves or ability to survive in the wilderness. If you watch the whole film, after the credits there is a disclaimer stating that it is purely ""fictitious."" This film was not meant to be scientifically accurate. If that is what you are looking for, watch the discovery channel. This movie is about man's will to live, and presents us with deeply philosophical undertones on the meaning of that struggle for life and the depths to which we will go to perseve it. The protagonist is a life beaten man who questions the meaning to his life, many times on the verge of quitting. But the beauty of the film lies in the final scene, where, remembering his family, Neeson makes his final decision: life is worth fighting for until the very end.

All the characters are made of cardboard, there is no depth, no story, no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I kept waiting for something engaging to happen all through the film and it never came.I do wonder what was Liam Neeson thinking though. I mean, why? Why at this point of your career would you want to self-destruct? This may be one of the lamest films I have ever seen and it truly sucked the life out of me.And I demand to know where did this 7.1 rating come from??",The Grey
870,cam-74199,"A Well Crafted, Yet Highly Misunderstood Film",10,30 November 2017,"I would like to start off this review by saying that this movie is not perfect, but the negative hype that it received was not warranted. The first time I watched this film, I was simply disappointed by the ending, because lets be honest, I wanted to watch Liam Neeson kick some wolf ass. I was mad, angry, and bitter about how the film ended. But fast-forward a few months to the second watch, and this is where the real beauty of this film presented itself to me.Before I get into the heart of this review, I want to offer some quick explanations for my high praise of this movie. Yes, I would recommend this film to anyone looking for an entertaining and suspenseful action film. The cinematography is beautiful, the script is well written, Neeson provides an outstanding performance (along with great supporting performances from the other actors), and the music and sound is exceptional, especially in sending chills down your spine whenever the wolves howl. Watch this movie in a dark room at night with surround sound, I guarantee you will not be disappointed.Now to the truth of the issue. THIS MOVIE IS NOT ABOUT THE WOLVES. This film is an emotional, suspenseful, and extensively metaphorical journey through the will of man to survive. Yes, wolves would not brutally hunt down humans. No, this film was not made to paint wolves in a bad light. The wolves in the film are simply a vehicle to convey one of the most masterfully crafted metaphors I have ever witnessed in a film.This is a story of survival. Each wolf represents a different fear that the men face, all of which try to kill them. The alpha wolf represents death, the leader of all fears that man must face. Since black is associated with death, it makes sense that the alpha wolf is black to complete the picture. Each man throughout the film struggles against his deepest fear, and eventually dies at the hands of it. It becomes clear on the plane that Flannery's biggest fear is being left out/excluded, and he dies when he gets separated from the group. Burke's biggest fear is being alone, which is supported by his struggle with the death of his sister. He dies alone during the storm before Ottway tries to wake him. Talget fears heights, and dies from a fall crossing the canyon. Even Diaz, who's biggest fear simply is feeling fear itself, dies alone while waiting for the wolves to come to him, whispering to himself ""I'm not afraid"".Now to Ottway. After almost committing suicide at the beginning of the film, I wondered why this man would go to such incredible lengths to survive. And I believe it is because his biggest fear is not having a purpose. After the plane crashes, he feels a purpose to help the other men survive. Even after they all die, he carries their wallets (essentially their souls) and feels the need to defend them against death (the alpha wolf) in the end.I would also like to point out how the entire film is about Ottway and the men running from their fears (the wolves). But they always catch up. Even when Ottway seems to escape all of these, he ends up in the den facing death (the alpha). This is a parallel to how no matter what, every person will eventually face death. It cannot be outrun. The beauty of how a man on the brink of suicide fights death in the bleakest moment really resonated with me on the second watch, when I could truly figure out what this film meant. Ottway is essentially a Christ figure, which is supported by the cut after the credits showing him putting his hand on the alpha as it dies (he conquers death and saves the wallets/souls of the dead), along with his call to God to help him after Henrick's death.All of this to say look closer. This is not about Liam Neeson killing wolves. This is not about wolves being portrayed as vicious creatures. This is about fear, death, life, and the human spirit. This is a metaphorical journey into the purpose of life, religion, and survival. Look past the superficial, and find the deeper meaning. You will not only appreciate the film, you will love it. I encourage you to watch this film again, to travel once more into the fray, and to truly understand the magnitude of what is being explored in this exceptional film.",The Grey
871,arguscustomknives,Not everyone can understand it,10,1 February 2018,"This is one of the deepest movies I have ever watched. Point is not about the wolves, location or anything else. Point is about him loosing the loved one. And only If you lost someone you truly loved you will be able to understand what he felt. He went to take his own life but he couldn't, subconsciously he wanted that someone else does it, in this case it was the wolves.",The Grey
872,ejwalden,The WORST MOVE I have ever seen!,1,13 February 2012,"THE WORST MOVE I HAVE EVER SEEN Plane crashes in the wilderness. Neeson and others spend what seemed like forever (~90 minutes) trying to escape ""killer wolves"". One person dies every scene.So unoriginal. So incredibly not entertaining. This is the only movie that I almost have actually walked out of.It cannot get worse than this movie. It is not suspenseful, thrilling, gripping, or any other attribute that may lead you to enjoy the movie.Save yourself the money, the time, and the frustration. Nothing redeeming at all about this move.",The Grey
873,oliverwhitehurst,"The Grey, such an underrated film.",7,6 March 2018,"This is not another mindless action thriller starring Liam Neeson. Nor is it a documentary about wolves, or a survival guide. It is a thought provoking, well paced, yet intense story about man's survival instincts. Set in the Alaskan north, Liam Neeson plays a wolf hunter who works for an oil company, by protecting the members of a drilling team. He and other members of the team are left stranded in the middle of nowhere after a plane crash. We follow these men as they struggle to survive in extreme conditions. The story is centered around Liam Neesons, brilliantly played character, who, troubled by his past, is suicidal before the crash, and then determined to survive afterwards. An original character with a dual nature, embodying life's struggles. The landscape is that of the vast and snowy plains of Alaska which is beautifully framed. The film balances light and dark shots/scenes very well throughout, reflecting the duality of the protagonist. The director manages to balance the vastness and the beauty of setting, with the intensity and fear of the people who's story we follow. I really enjoyed this film. I found it to be intense yet it remains human. Of course, it is not without its faults. Mainly the excessive amount of flashbacks to his past. As well as the poorly done CG wolves. There's also some problems with logic throughout the film. But if you look past its minor amount of flaws, you will find a great film, brilliantly directed and acted. I would definitely recommend this film despite the surprising amount of negative, and unjust reviews.",The Grey

876,greengrass49,Terrible film,3,29 January 2012,"I had to talk my wife into seeing this movie with me, big mistake. We both hated this movie. I really wanted to like this movie... I loved The Edge, that is one of my favorite movies of all time. I also really like Liam Neeson, he is one of my favorite actors. I love stories of survival but was more of a horror film. Some of the scenes were very bloody and gruesome. I didn't give this movie a 1 because the acting was good and the scenery was very good. The plot was horrible. The wolves looked like robots. I would have given it a better review only if the movie ended with a scene of wolves mauling the director in his chair.",The Grey
877,festynoodle,Stunning,8,13 October 2018,"Gorgeous story and set up, nothing happens too quickly and I love that it doesn't fall down the deep and meaningful backstories of the characters too much. The ""my wife died of cancer"" trope was spun into something so much more than a pity story, also I have a soft spot for short poems so I think that's what got me sobbing at the end of this movie. It's a different feeling to Joe Carnahan's movies he's made before but still has the same taste. Love.",The Grey
