0,MartinHafer,Waiting for the worm to turn.,9,20 August 2021,"""The White Tiger"" is a film set in India and the actors are Indian as well, though the production appears made for audiences outside India who are not familiar with their political and social systems. As a result, the film explains to the audience in many portions...something I really liked and appreciated.The story follows the life of Balram (Adarsh Gourav), a poor young man with few prospects in love other than poverty. However, he aspires to move up...to the role of a servant. For folks of his social class, this is a huge improvement with more opportunities. After obtaining a job as a driver, Balram is slavishly devoted to the family who employs him. However, again and again the family treats him like garbage. Or, they treat him well one moment and the next, he's garbage once again. Throughout the entire film, Balram keeps smiling and taking their abuse...and the viewer is left wondering will he eventually turn? Will he rise up against these cruel and unjust jerks? And, if he does....what next?!The film is very eye-opening in its cynicism. Democratic and free India is shown as a land of hypocrisy....and cheating and even worse are what you need to be prepared to do if you want to move up to the middle and upper classes. Bribes to government officials and the police (a frequent topic in Indian films, as they seem to take this as a normal part of business) as well as contempt for the poor...this is the sort of India you see in this movie.Overall, this is a film that starts slowly but really sucks you in due to excellent writing and a script and style that is unlike most Bollywood films I have seen. There are not song and dance routines and the story is not a nice love story...but more a documentary style film about class struggle. Well worth your time and exceptional.",The White Tiger

He does enough asides as he spouts his socialist message that excludes whites. Not as entertaining as ""Slumdog Millionaire"" nor is there any dancing. Well done but a slow moving Horatio Alger story. Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",The White Tiger
2,evanston_dad,Exuberant Film About the Dark Side of Indian Democracy,7,2 February 2021,"""The White Tiger"" is the antidote to ""Slumdog Millionaire."" The latter film feels like a bunch of white guys appropriating Indian culture to tell their version of a fairy tale. ""The White Tiger,"" by contrast, feels like a movie about India made by people who understand India.It's an energetic, exuberant movie about the desperation that drives a poor ambitious man from a small village to murder and eventually a life of wealth and privilege. It's a dog eat dog story, almost literal in its telling and lacking any nuance, but pretty entertaining. It also feels very familiar to those of us living in places like the United States, where the lip service given to words like democracy, freedom, and capitalism are belied by the reality of those who have trampling over those who have not in the race to get even more.I enjoyed the glimpses of modern-day India that this movie offered, even if they convinced me it's not a place I'm in any hurry to visit soon.Grade: A-",The White Tiger
3,ferguson-6,storming the caste,7,26 April 2021,"Greetings again from the darkness. Writer-director Ramin Bahrani (the excellent 99 HOMES, 2014) adapted Aravind Adiga's 2008 novel, and for his efforts, he was awarded an Oscar nomination for adapted screenplay. The honor is justified thanks to the complexity of the story, though we are never sure if this is satire of, or insight and enlightenment into India's caste system. Either way, it hooks us early and never lets go.Adarsh Gourav stars as Balram, and the story is structured via his narration of his own life story as outlined in a letter he drafts to Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao prior to his official visit to India in 2010. The timeline stretches from Balram's youth to the time of the letter, when he describes himself as a Bangalore entrepreneur who rose from poverty to being a self-made man. We are there when Balram overhears the local powerbroker known as The Stork (Mahesh Manjrekar) mention that the family needs a second driver. The ambitious Balram borrows money from Granny (Kamlesh Gill) for driving lessons, and soon he's at the gate talking his way into the job.Balram is hired as the driver for The Stork's son, Ashok (Rajkummar Rao) who has returned from his time in the U. S. with an American woman, Pinky (Priyanka Chopra Jonas) by his side. It's bizarre to see Balram's eager-to-please ways contrast with the western approach Ashok and Pinky apply. Whereas servants are usually treated poorly, mixed messages are received by Balram, who ends up sleeping in a parking garage storage room while his masters luxuriate in a Delhi penthouse.A tragic event occurs leaving Balram betrayed by the family to which he's displayed nothing but loyalty. The film even takes a wicked shot at the Oscar winning SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE (2008), although the films do share some common themes. This film follows the plight of a servant, and takes a particularly close look at the 'haves' and the 'have-nots'. Just how far can one be pushed before standing up or fighting back. Since the film starts where the story ends, we are prepared for the path, though the actual steps are stunning.Filmmaker Bahrani floats dark comedic undertones, though it's never really funny - in fact, most of the story is quite serious. Mr. Gourav excels in the lead role as he explains India's social structure through big belly vs small belly. His journey takes him through multiple personality shifts - the poor villager busting rocks, the eager to impress new servant, the insightful young man who learns a harsh lesson, and finally, the ""self-made"" man, confident in his abilities and able to overlook his own actions that got him there.",The White Tiger
4,siderite,"You have to realize that the lead is a sympathetic villain, not a hero",7,2 March 2021,"We are slaves to the narratives we've been fed since childhood. The White Tiger is about that and slyly works on the same mechanism, as well. You see, you think you will watch a story of the rise of a nice boy from poverty, but in fact it is the story of the forced corruption of a man. This might not sit well with you because, you see, you've been told stories when you were raised about how the good in people always triumphs. I find it hilarious that the viewer is somehow pulled in as a character in the lesson of this film.And there are a lot of positives for the film: the acting was top notch, the story held so many little excruciating moments - like watching the training of a dog: you cringe, but somehow see the value in it. You wouldn't want to be the dog, but hey, you're not, so it's OK. It also dissects the culture of India, shows some horrific systemic problems with the country. The main character exclaims in disgust ""The biggest democracy in the world"", but fails to realize, maybe even up to the end, that the fact people continue to put up with everything and organically organize hierarchically is an artifact of democracy, that things are kind of the same all over the place, maybe without the over the counter slave mentality, but very similar nonetheless.Not everything is good. The story told as the writing of an email, the hinted at but never realized idea of the white man's yoke being replaced by the brown and yellow man's.... yoke, the ending. I would have given this film one full extra star if not for the weak ending.Bottom line: teaches one about the realities of the soon most numerous country in the world, but also about the commonalities with other places. I would love to see a sequel/remake set in the US or in the Netherlands. Make it a series about people that wake up.",The White Tiger
5,blanbrn,Shows the highs and lows of life a take on class and the caste system.,5,23 January 2021,"""The White Tiger"" is one film that's a journey of life highs and lows that are blended by secrets, rich and poor and trying to escape a class and caste system while trying to win against corrupt ways and means. The story follows the life of an Indian boy named Bahram and how his early journey start in a poor village spans out to serving rich masters. He eventually becomes a driver for the well to do and along the way experiences and learns plenty as he becomes wise and learns how to play the system. Overall the story is okay and the chemistry and acting all right as you can call it a fairy tale and your little rags to riches story.",The White Tiger
6,lasttimeisaw,Cinema Omnivore - The White Tiger (2021) 7.0/10,7,6 June 2021,"""The movie's tone also takes a sharp turn after Balram is wrong-footed by the reveal of Ashok and Pinky's true color, the prior playful, carefree vibes are supplanted by a menacing, subdued gloom that bodes ill, once Balram's a-rooster-escaping-from-its-coop resolution settles in, there is no turning back of the imminent bloodletting, but when that occurs, three quarters of the film's running time has elapsed, which inevitably, foreshortens Balram's ascension to be the owner of a taxi company in Bangalore, therefore takes some credibility out of this cautionary tale, as if venality alone can work the magic of actualization an ""Indian dream"". That said, Gourav is such an extraordinarily multifaceted performer, he can alternate between being smarmy, wide-eyed, indignant, hurt, world-savvy or callous at a moment's notice, and when he beams, his open-faced smile is infectious, yet deep in your heart, you know you cannot trust that smile.""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks.",The White Tiger
7,MOscarbradley,An 'Indian' movie clearly aimed at a western audience.,7,2 February 2021,"Produced by Netflix and clearly aimed at an international, or at least a western, audience Ramin Bahrani's film version of Aravind Adiga's best-selling novel ""The White Tiger"" is a 'modern' Indian's vision of India filtered through western eyes. It's hero, Balram, (an excellent Adarsh Gourav), is an ambitious lower-caste servant who finagles his way into a rich landlord's home as a driver before circumstances force him to take drastic action to better himself and become, as he describes it, an entrepeneur.it's an entertaining movie crammed full of 'local colour' with an eye very much on the tourist market but it lacks depth. Themes like poverty, the caste-system and political corruption, (rife it would appear), are glossed over in favour of a thriller plot as if dwelling on these issues in any detail would detract from what is primarily 'an entertainment'. The film feels a little too ""Slumdog Millionaire"" when it should be ""Wall Street"" with Gourav as both Michael Douglas and Charlie Sheen. By the time it moves into darker territory it feels more than a little contrived. Still, it's redeemed by Gourav's outstanding performance, clearly marking him out as a talent to watch in the future.",The White Tiger
8,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Once in a generation...,7,20 February 2021,"Though it has an odd, pretty iffy overall message, 'The White Tiger (2021)' is typically an entertaining and engaging time. It's a story about a poor man who uses his wit and cunning to work his way up the chain of servitude to try and improve his standing. The film puts a spotlight on the poverty divide in India, an issue which is perpetuated by deep-rooted social inequalities. For the most part, you're firmly on the side of the protagonist. This is true even after he starts to make some questionable decisions, although there does come a point where his actions are too extreme to, shall we say, cheer for. Still, the story is dark and its moral ambiguity is a key component. It's well-made and convincing from start to finish. It's an enjoyable experience. The pacing is a bit off, though, and the ending feels very rushed. 7/10",The White Tiger
9,Cineanalyst,Slumdog Entrepreneur,7,25 January 2021,"""The White Tiger"" is a solid soak-the-rich tale, even including a climax in the rain, which among the other symbolic purposes, gives pun to the phrase. Comparisons to that other Western rags-to-riches movie set in India, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" (2008), seem inevitable. This is grittier in some ways than that fantasy rooted in Bollywood, classic Hollywood and TV game-show magical escapism from poverty, and, indeed, it has been called the anti-""Slumdog Millionaire"" movie. Although there's a bit of singing, and the score is good, there is no musical dance number here. ""The White Tiger"" is more in the film noir tradition.We have the protagonist's voiceover narration, with the modern tendency towards breaking the fourth wall. His life story is also framed as a message he's composing for a Chinese dignitary, if not as a direct address to the audience. We have the femme fatale driving the car on the fateful night--framed as fateful by its placement at the beginning. She lures or awakens him from his ""rooster coop"" acceptance of caste system servility. And, finally, we have that purifying rain. All of these are noir tropes.If you want to see ""The White Tiger"" as social commentary, fine, I suppose, and it surely offers a less sugar-coated conciliatory approach for the wealthy than does ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" but this is a non-realist genre picture much in the same way that Best Picture Oscar winner is, except it's a different genre. A charismatic transformation by Adarsh Gourav in the lead holds the construction together and helps make for an entertaining alternative to ""Slumdog Millionaire.""",The White Tiger
10,vincentlynch-moonoi,Personally very mixed feelings about this flick,7,14 February 2021,"I spent many long summers (usually 7 weeks at a time) and two years living in Thailand. I didn't hesitate to explore any place. Over the past couple of years I've enjoyed watching quite a few movies/series about India, and I have regretted never having spent at least one summer in India. Until I saw this film. Every movie/series says something about life in a particular country. And most of the films/series I've watched about India has shown me a number of positive things about India. I wondered if they were all very realistic. This film shows a very ugly side of India. And since much of it is filmed in real environments (rather than movie studios), it's a pretty ugly picture. I've lost any desire I had to visit India. It isn't so much the poverty that it shows, as it is a still-existing sort of caste system. Ugly, ugly, ugly.On the other hand, it's a well done film. The acting on the part of the three main characters is excellent. I hope to see Adarsh Gourav in something totally different, but he certainly did well here. Likewise, Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Rajkummar Rao turned in fine performances. As a film telling a story...well done. The problem is that it's a very ugly story. I can't judge how realistic the plot is since I haven't spent time in India; but I would hope that India is not this bad a place.Here's the bottom line of what I walked away with: India is a place of utter hopelessness for anyone in the lower class.",The White Tiger

Is neo-liberal, systemic-based bigotry any better than old-fashioned, in-your-face bigotry? Or is its covertness just perpetuate another level of insidious strength?

14,alindsay-al,A good well acted film,7,26 January 2021,"This film came to Netflix on Friday and I made out 2 hours of my day to watch The White Tiger and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a young Indian Driver attempt to rise from servant to master and reach the top.Main Character
Adarsh Gourvav is an inexperienced actor but he plays the lead here and I thought he was fantastic. He shows so much range in this film, he has to play different roles as his character progresses on his journey and Gourav nails it and delivers pretty much every scene no matter what it requires him to do. His character is fascinating and complex too with you really questioning whether you are meant to root for him or not and it is really well done.Supporting Characters
Priyanka Chopra is the most familiar name in the film for a western audience and she is also really good here. She feels a bit like an outsider towards the other characters and her relationship with Gourav is one of the best things about the film and for the most part I thought she was the most likeable person in the film. Rajkummar Rao plays her husband and he is also very good, he is more then just your average rich guy and he sells his role well and you see how complex a life he leads and how his character plays in the journey of Gourav's character. The rest of the cast are also good and add plenty to the scenes that they are a part of.Story
The story is good, it is interesting seeing the journey of this man from rags to riches and the film creates interesting characters and ones that are complex and make you want to watch. The twists and turns feel appropriate and not too overblown and it builds and builds to a decent conclusion. Though the one thing I will say is that the final act of the film can't keep up the quality and I have to admit I kind of wanted to see more of Gourav's character when he made it to the top of the mountain, this element isn't given enough time for sure.Script
The script is decent, there is a blend of humour and drama and for me the drama was handled better. There are some pretty intense scenes and I grew to care about what was going on and how it affected the characters. But yeah I think towards the beginning of the film it wanted you to laugh more and I just didn't, I chuckled a couple of times but nothing major. Also the use of voice over is overused here and I think the film could have done with fewer instances of this.Style
The style shows India really well and I felt like I really experienced India and not like some other Bollywood films that I have seen and credit to the film for that. But this film has a bit of a pacing issue, I think if the final act was shortened and tightened up it would have been a way more effective experience.Overall
Overall, this is a good film. It tells an interesting story with interesting characters and if you have time then this one is worth a watch.",The White Tiger

18,masonfisk,AN ASIAN GREAT GATSBY...!,10,5 April 2021,"A recent Netflix original about the have's & have not's in modern day India. Based on a novel by Aravind Adiga which details a boy from the slums who gets a job as a rich family's driver (he will exclusively be driving the patriarch's son & his recently wed wife) & soon lets the fine line between each world crumble away which leads to a tragic conclusion but not for the person you think. At first exceptionally proud of being the driver (so much so he even massages the boy's father taking whatever abuse flung his way like oxygen) his mind starts to wonder if he can do better (especially when the son prefers he be called by his first name & not 'sir') in life if he applies himself (he soon starts to groom himself & dressing the part) but when in an unfortunate turn of events, the son's wife, played by Priyanka Chopra-Jonas (who co-executive produces here along w/Ava Duvernay) runs over a child crossing the street at night only for the driver to volunteer he was behind the wheel (to make matters worse when no witnesses come forward, the son's crafty right hand man & lawyer have him sign a statement of his complicity) which sets the stage for the driver to assert himself (he starts to embezzle money on the side faking repairs to his vehicle, selling off excess gas & even in his spare time taking fares) when he wises up to the corrupt system India's government employs (to the public at large politicians in line w/the people are put into office but to avoid paying taxes businessmen shell out enormous bribes) he bides his time to strike. Feeling like a story which was inspired by F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, our hero realizes the one person in the world you can't fool is himself as his actions (reprehensible as they are!) soon afford him the lifestyle he deserves as family & unnecessary attachments fall by the wayside. Our anti-hero, wonderfully realized by first time actor Ardash Gourav, plays so many notes in his performance it's a wonder he manages to get the audience to see things from his point of view even when things turn toward the dark side.",The White Tiger

20,questl-18592,White Tiger Can't Jump,8,9 April 2021,"Oh I'm so glad I'm trying to watch the Oscar films because I would have NEVER watched this otherwise and this was a really unique and enlightening experience. The White Tiger is the story of a young man trying to pull his way out of poverty and into the upper echelons of his society in what feels like a pretty authentic depiction of that world. It's not the most unique story and that's probably my biggest problem with the film. It's pretty basic in terms of story and unfortunately that leads to the somewhat underwhelming and hollow ending that felt devoid of any real punch that I think it was hoping for.Negatives aside, this was a remarkable experience and a stunning eye opener to see this part of the world that I was completely blind to before. The way this movie portrays the Indian culture with such honesty and openness was really incredible and worthy of all the attention this movie gets. As Americans, we take for granted so much about the way our culture works and the things we have going for us and to actually see how this other culture operates, a culture that consists of a HUGE number of people in a crucial part of the world is absolutely worthy of being watched by anyone and everyone. It also felt very engaging the whole way through rather than just being preachy or documentary feeling. There's a legit narrative, solid performances and enough present to keep my eyes on the screen and off my phone or my watch.I think we need more movies like this. Films that highlight other parts of the world, that show us the lives and lifestyle of different corners of the world but do so in a way that's engaging and accessible to a wide array of people. Strongly recommend this to everyone and will also strongly recommend watching it with subtitles turned on because it can be hard to understand at times.",The White Tiger

The White Tiger tells Balram's story as he drags himself out of poverty and the shackles of caste to become a successful entrepreneur.It's not often I'll watch films based in India . Bollywood films certainly don't appeal to me but this one is different. It's made for the western film watching market and has that feel of a crossover movie and I have to say it works well - to a point .Adarsh Gourav who is plays Balram is the star of this show . He's charismatic and funny and so easy to watch .
The way he is scheming behind his bosses backs to become an entrepreneur is clever and you can't help but root for him .The first half of this film is great . It's almost like a comedy at times and it certainly made me chuckle but then it gets dark and that's where this film falls down .There is a incidence where a tragic accident happens and Balram is forced to take the blame . It's what happens next between him and his boss that is so out of character that I couldn't buy into it at all .I understood it's a film about Karma but if Karma was a thing , the ending for Balram would be very different to the one we are given .All in all I enjoyed the film and gave me a great insight into Indian culture but the ending felt too rushed for me.",The White Tiger

23,arungeorge13,"A quirky, well-crafted first half followed by a less amusing second! [+61%]",6,23 January 2021,"Ramin Bahrani's adaptation of Aravind Adiga's novel (of the same name), much like Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire, is a film that tells the rags-to-riches story of a rural Indian oaf named Balram Halwai. The major difference between the two films is with respect to how the theme is tackled. One goes the straightforward-hero route and the other goes the anti-hero route. Adarsh Gourav as chauffeur Balram knocks it outta the park in his first leading role, making us resonate with his thoughts, the subtle reactions to the casteist, elitist slurs (from the wealthy household he serves) he's subjected to, and his ultimate transition into a cunning brute. The supporting cast is quite strong but their potential for greatness is limited as the film is told entirely from the perspective of Balram.And for that reason, established performers like Rajkummar Rao and Priyanka Chopra get roles really don't require actors of their sophistication. Also, The White Tiger's storyline sinks a tad too deep into the social commentary it offers, rendering the climax and pre-climax portions largely bland. The first half is where the film scores abundantly, be it in terms of plot progression, performances, visualization, and soundscape. Because the film takes the non-linear storytelling route (we meet Balram initially as an entrepreneur and he's basically reminiscing his struggle-filled journey), it even gets predictable beyond a point, especially in the latter half.To be fair on part of the makers, the picture it paints of the rural-superstitious-poor and the wealthy-yet-discriminatory urban sides of India didn't come across as particularly eye-opening (as it might be for Western viewers). A little extra hygiene in the writing department could have made The White Tiger even more impactful. It almost feels like Ramin Bahrani settled for the most convenient climax possible, storywise. For a film that showed realistic (and gritty) intellect in its first hour, that ending feels a bit like a wet firecracker. But Adarsh Gourav is certainly someone to watch out for!",The White Tiger

25,blott2319-1,Decent plot ruined by the built in spoilers,5,5 February 2021,"Sometimes I feel like a broken record because I am so frequently repeating my complaints about movies, but it seems there are some things that filmmakers will never stop doing that I hate. For example, The White Tiger is yet another movie that utilizes voiceover for no good reason. Not only that, but it is voiceover by the main character in the future, so they have already drained a great deal of tension out of the movie because we know from the start he will grow to become a successful businessman by the end. And apparently that wasn't enough spoiling of the plot for this movie, they even teased one of the most important plot points of the movie in the opening sequence before jumping into a 90-minute flashback. After watching the entire film, I am completely baffled by these decisions in the script, because it totally undermines the plot. I have confidence that this entire movie would have been much more impactful and entertaining to me without the voiceover or the flash-forward, because they served no purpose.Letting all of that go, The White Tiger is not a bad movie, and it shows the complexity of the class system that still exists in India. There is a strong analogy that starts the movie, and we can see how that plays out in our main character's life. The cast does a good job across the board, and I love the different ways people react to the entire class system. There are also some subtle things that they don't call attention to, which show how people change their behavior based on who is watching or the situation. Adarsh Gourav is particularly strong in the lead role, and you can tell he has the mannerisms of a servant perfected. I did have some struggles with the fact that there aren't any likable characters in the film. The people who are most kind to the servants still take advantage of them, and at best they treat the main character like a lovable pet. Even the protagonist himself resorts to some pretty unpleasant behavior to get what he wants. I think there is a good story at the heart of The White Tiger despite the fact that it is told through a bunch of flawed characters, but it is the flawed narrative structure that bothers me more.",The White Tiger

This is one of the years Best movies in my opinion it's entertaining, educational and beautifully produced.It's the best film depicting modern day India and the huge divide between rich and poor and the caste system that I've seen. As India enters the World as a super power the educated and wealthy thrive and prosper while the millions of poorer struggling families can only hope for an opportunity to escape "" the rooster coup""
(a very descriptive scene in the film to illustrate our main character Balram's ambition to escape his fate and the poverty of his family.Ramin Bahrain Director and Screen Writer has been Nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay at this years Academy Awards as well as a BAFTA nomination in the same Category
It's Star Adarsh Gourav who is brilliant cast as Balram an ambitious Indian driver uses his wit and cunning to escape from poverty and rise to the top. The White Tiger is an epic journey based on the New York Times bestseller by Aravind Adiga.Animal symbolism is used in the movie to describe the main characters in the film of to symbolise their nature. Such as Balram the white tiger (for being calculated and dangerous), Ashok the lamb (for being soft and pampered) Mukesh as the mongoose, and the landlord as the stork etc.It's a beautiful film to watch I can't understand why the Cinematographer Paolo Carnera. Hasn't been nominated for an award.It's a fine ensemble cast too many to mention but standouts are Rajkummar Rao as Ashok as the bosses son who Balram is employed as driver and Priyanka Chopra as Pinky Madam the wife of Ashok who grew up in New York and finds life in India too much of a culture clash.Not all movies deserve the acclaim they receive I tried to watch ""Palm Springs "" today which was nominated for 2 Golden Globes it may be a generational gap but I just thought what I watched plain drivel and not worth the time.""The White Tiger ""was the opposite experience as it's quality Cinema from the beginning to the conclusion I thoroughly recommend this fine film.",The White Tiger
29,djurrepower,kinda cringe,3,16 March 2021,It feels like its pandering to the viewer. With all the narriarion/monologue it's way too cliche. I guess that the main charater just isn't all that likable. Overall i rolled my eyes many times.3/10: nahnana,The White Tiger
30,msbreviews,"THE WHITE TIGER tells an interesting and enlightening story, but it loses itself with an overwhelming amount of narrative events.",5,22 January 2021,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Even though The White Tiger isn't exactly the first review I published in 2021, it was the first film I watched at the start of this new year. I really didn't know what to expect. I've never seen anything from any actor involved in the movie or from the writer-director, Ramin Bahrani. I still follow the ""trailer-free"" philosophy that I established back in 2017, so my knowledge about the actual story was close to null. Nevertheless, all of these details left me quite excited, to be completely honest. Starting 2021 with a 100% blind watch (something I sincerely appreciate) is an excellent way of beginning a year that I hope will be better than the previous one (it shouldn't be that hard).From the get-go, it's clear that Bahrani will use his film in an enlightening, educational manner to teach its viewers about India's sociopolitical stratification (caste system) and its economic consequences. The viewer follows Adarsh Gourav's character, Balram, who's trying to get away from the dated traditions and become a real entrepreneur. I rarely love straight-up political movies, even when these follow the satire route. On par with religion, these are two matters that I've been avoiding talking about my whole life. From corruption to wars, there are literally hundreds of reasons that justify my detachment from these topics.With that said, The White Tiger holds several significant messages concerning poor families (low caste) who must work hard in unimaginable conditions just to survive, specifically in India. It also approaches ideas such as arranged marriage and the unbreakable master-servant bond. These cultural lessons on India's sociopolitical and socioeconomic structure are by far the most interesting aspect of the entire screenplay, and Bahrani does a fantastic job of conveying this awareness to the audience in a compelling manner. With the help of Paolo Carnera (DP), the story is filmed at ground-level, putting the viewers in the dirty, smelly, impoverished streets of different places across India, generating a realistic atmosphere. Chad Keith's production design is also vital to create that immersive Indian environment.Despite the wonderful technical aspects, Bahrani's script is packed with an overwhelming succession of narrative events that fail to further develop the protagonist or impact the story, especially from the mid-point of the film onwards. Some sequences are similar to previous ones, ultimately making the movie feel repetitive while not moving the plot forward. Unfortunately, it really feels like the viewers could miss a couple of minutes here and there and not miss anything genuinely relevant. Therefore, Bahrani's flick becomes overlong and slower than what it needs to be, consequently affecting the viewers' attention, which might result in some of the critical messages getting lost in the transmission, mainly the economic one. Balram's narration helps, but Bahrani could have found a better (and more logical) justification for this storytelling detail.In addition to this, it's a film that depends on the viewers' knowledge about India and their interest in learning more about it. In my case, The White Tiger didn't surprise me with any information - which doesn't help the entertainment value - but its visuals helped me connect what I knew to something quite palpable. I do want to end on a positive note, though. The unknown cast is phenomenal, but the biggest praise must go to Adarsh Gourav's first lead role. Balram is a well-written character who will definitely connect with many viewers all around the world. Gourav shows quite a good range, demonstrating his comedic timing and funny expressions, but also an emotional side that truly elevated some of the best scenes in the entire movie.The White Tiger employs the English and Indian languages to educate viewers about India's sociopolitical and socioeconomic system by following Adarsh Gourav's character, who narrates the largest email ever about his life. Despite the somewhat silly setup, Ramin Bahrani delivers an enlightening, interesting narrative with dozens of relevant messages regarding India's culture and the incredibly challenging way of living of most of its population. Gourav offers a brilliant performance (debut in a lead role), elevating a well-written, relatable character who goes through an unbelievable life story surrounded by an immersive production design and terrific camera work, creating a realistic environment. Unfortunately, this Netflix's flick is overwhelmed by an absurd amount of gradually unimpactful narrative events, unnecessarily extending the runtime and hurting the overall pacing. By becoming repetitive, the viewers' attention levels decrease, leading to a scenario where some of the essential lessons get lost in their delivery. Overall, I recommend it to viewers interested in learning more about India and people who actually lived or were born there, but if your knowledge about the country is good enough, it might not be as entertaining and informative as you would expect.Rating: C+",The White Tiger
31,SoumikBanerjee25,Adarsh Gourav is a Talent worth looking out for.,6,23 January 2021,"""The White Tiger"" is neither your average rags to riches story nor it ever pretends to be. An enthralling yet tortuous ride; illustrating the ever present Socio-economic diversity & the intrinsic allegiance of a Servant to his Master as a symbolism of the same.Embossed in a somber tonality, the plot exhibits an enticing story of a country bumpkin 'Balram' and his aberrant journey comprised of servitude, cunning & apparent insurgence which ultimately pushes him towards his pre-defined destiny.The first half was more prominent at representing those particular aspects than the second one which gradually got bemusing & diffident. More so in its third act, which to be honest; must have seen a finer treatment here.Moving onto the technicalities, Ramin Bahrani as the director made sure of film's outward aesthetics to be captivating. Paolo Carnera's Cinematography perpetuating the city vibe; as well as discernible nuances from rural neighborhood. Tagging alongside a dynamic Soundscore, that quite endorses the inherent thrills. Except, those titilations only come forth momentarily; rest of the time, it resembles more or less like a social commentary.When it comes down to Performances, one couldn't argue against Adarsh Gourav's flawless feat. There were some highlighting moments in his act; that were indeed praiseworthy. Barring his crucial contribution, other characters didn't have much opportunities to develop. Rajkummar Rao, Priyanka Chopra; both are seasoned performers yet the makers surprisingly decided to subdue their luminary presence in here and I'm not sure if that was really a sensible decision to go with.In conclusion, I liked the overall proposition; although at the same time my grievance would be about its inadequateness in yielding an appeasing outcome conclusively. I indeed admire their strenuous efforts embodying such a dauntless attempt. But in reality things didn't turn out as one would have heartily hoped for.",The White Tiger

35,cliftonofun,No gameshows or dance numbers,6,23 May 2021,"When you say ""rags to riches Indian film,"" most people will probably think about Slumdog Millionaire. But that film is more fairytale than anything else, complete with the protagonist getting the girl and then dancing in a Bollywood number afterwards. This film is something fundamentally different - a rags to riches story that suggests servants only triumph when they rise up against their masters. Kill or be killed. It's a more unflinching look at castes and poverty in India (and really everywhere), and it really works for the first 2/3. Unfortunately, it runs out of steam a bit at that point - the climax just feels a bit rushed. Still, regardless of whether you like or agree with the protagonist, it's worth remembering that those left out of our economic systems cannot just go on a gameshow to get out.",The White Tiger
36,ronakkotian,Highlights many of the problems present in India,7,23 January 2021,"I was very excited to see The White Tiger. From the teaser trailer and the superb cast, I had a feeling this film will deliver and it did.The White Tiger follows Balram, a poor driver who uses his wit and guile to free himself from servitude to his masters and make his way to the top.Based on a book by Aravind Adiga, The White Tiger takes a close inspection at all the problems India possesses. The film uses a first person narrative as a tool to convey Balram's entire journey which is a technique used in films like Goodfellas or The Wolf of Wall Street. I thought this storytelling method was a great choice as we got a complete idea of what our protagonist is like and what his views are. Long after the film, I was still thinking about it. Like Parasite, the main theme of The White Tiger is the division between classes. We see the luxurious lifestyle led by the rich whilst the poor have to stay in the darkness and sleep in areas infested with cockroaches. Director Ramin Bahrani takes a direct approach and tells you exactly what the film is trying to say. At times it may feel heavy-handed but Bahrani infuses a lot of clever dialogue with interesting metaphors that are sure to stick with you.The cinematography by Paolo Carnera is brilliant. The dim lighting and desaturated look brings to light the issues the film is presenting. As Balram refers to the poor as 'the darkness', there is a sense of that looming over the entire film once again adding to the idea of classism. As mentioned before, Bahrani's screenplay is striking by taking us into the mind of Balram and seeing the world through his eyes. Along with classism, Bahrani sheds light on other relevant issues that are currently present in India today whether it's casteism, the corruption or the way the rich abuse their power, there's a lot to take away from The White Tiger.At the heart of the film we have Adarsh Gourav who is mesmerising as Balram. This film belongs to him and he's shines at every moment. There's a particular scene where he's told to take the blame for something he didn't do and Gourav's eyes and facial expressions convey so much about what he's thinking. I really hope he gains more recognition after this film. Priyanka Chopra Jonas also does a very good job and is believable in the role. Rajkummar Rao, who's usually the best part of his films, is one of the film's weak points. His American accent isn't consistent and so his dialogue delivery does feel clumsy at times. Mahesh Manjrekar and Vijay Maurya are also great in their roles.The White Tiger is a well made drama filled with social commentary that's sure to make you think about the issues India are dealing with. Adarsh Gourav turns in a magnificent performance that should be watched and I'm intrigued to see what Ramin Bahrani will make next.",The White Tiger
37,trinaboice,Let me tell you why I have mixed feelings about this film,8,26 January 2021,"I have mixed feelings about this movie...
IN A NUTSHELL:
Directed and written by Ramin Bahrani, this dark comedy is based on the book The White Tiger: A Novel by Aravind Adiga, and offers socio-political commentary on India. The outstanding cast and intriguing themes will keep you thinking about this rags-to-riches film for quite some time.THINGS I LIKED:
Great opening.
Adarsh Gourav gives a truly fantastic, break-out performance. We are sure to see a lot more of him in the future. At least, I hope so.
Priyanka Chopra is actually the winner of the Miss India and Miss World beauty pageants in 2000. She's also a very good actress and offers a familiar face in the cast to many Americans because she's married to musician and actor Nick Jonas. Among many achievements, she made the May 2016 cover of TIME magazine for being one of the top 100 Most Influential People.
Rajkummar Rao is also known as Raj Kumar. He's a big Bollywood star who is sure to be seen in more American films.
I love the storytelling style of breaking the 4th wall to take the viewer along a journey. Two of my favorite movies that do this extremely well and happen to feature Matthew Broderick in both are Ladyhawke and Ferris Bueller's Day Off.
Every frame is an amazing picture. The cinematography by Paolo Carnera was excellent as you explore India.
You get to take a trip to India and learn a lot about the country's caste system, way of thinking, economic situation, food, customs, and connection to China.
It was fascinating to contrast two Indians with different viewpoints. Adarsh Gourav's character, Balram, was born and raised in India into extreme poverty, yet he completely embraces the mentality of the country and his station in life...for a time. Priyanka Chopra's character, Pinky Madam, was born in India, yet educated in America, which causes her to question outdated traditions in her motherland. Their conversations get them both thinking about their place in India.
All of the characters are flawed, despite their efforts to live according to their values. You get instantly pulled into their lives and feel immediately invested in them.
Fun musical soundtrack.
The movie does a great job with a risky technique. You're told the end of the story at the very beginning, but rather than it being a spoiler, you look forward to learning how a character actually gets from point A to point B.
There is a very powerful and unexpected twist in the movie that takes it to a surprising new level.
The white tiger is described as something that's born only once in a generation, much like the protagonist.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
The extreme poverty is heartbreaking to watch. Early on in the movie, we learn that Balram, the servant, will be paid 1500 rupees for a month as a personal driver. That sounds like a lot, but just to put that into perspective, that's only $20.55 in US dollars. FOR A MONTH! The servant is told he will get a raise of 2000 rupees after he works for 2 months. That's still only $27.40 for a month's work.
The movie feels long, yet ends kind of abruptly.
Blatant product placement in movies always annoys me. In this movie, the Sheraton Hotel gets a big shout-out.
There is some humor in Act 1, but then Act 2 and 3 become very, very dark.
I love a rags-to-riches story, but I finished the movie with a very uneasy feeling because the message is that the end justifies the means. Is that the message they REALLY want us to take away after watching this movie????TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Lots of F-bombs spoken and written
Name-calling
Lots of subtitles to read
You'll learn a lot about India and the caste system
You'll learn about how Indians feel about Hinduism, Islam, and Christianity

38,rubenm,Anyone who loves India will love this movie,7,28 January 2021,"'Create Your Fate', reads the slogan on the poster of 'The White Tiger'. It sounds like something a self help guru might come up with. Or it could have been a quote from a speech by Frank T.J. Mackey from 'Magnolia'. In fact, it is the life motto of Balram, the main character in 'The White Tiger'.
In the movie, he decides to leave the rural Indian village where he was born and seems destined to spend the rest of his life. The search for a suitable bride is already in progress. But his self-created fate leads him to the household of a rich and corrupt businessman, where he single-handedly creates his own job as a driver. With a mix of subservience, ruthlessness and determination he subsequently manages to escape his life as an employee, to create his own business and become a rich man himself.
The film is a portrait of modern-day India, with all the vitality and extremes that go with it. It doesn't shy away from the poverty, the corruption, the discrimination and the cultural conservatism, but it does so in a light-hearted way. At the same time, Balram's life is so full of events that the film moves forward without a single dull moment.
The book it is based upon was a major bestseller and I remember reading it with much delight. I enjoyed the movie just as much. Anyone who loves India will love this movie.",The White Tiger
39,ridi-arahan,"It's much more than a sheer luck, or destiny or hard work, it's also your decisions and choices you make",8,25 January 2021,"What worked :
The movie is a beautiful and absorbing tale of a common man, riding from rags to the riches, and the journey in between. It's entertaining and engrossing movie, keeping the viewers curious, and enjoy the ride. Adarsh stole the show, making the well intended transformation in his character throughout the narrative, and making it a believable watch. Rajkumar was the right supporting actor for the role, making it more authentic and a beautiful combo. What makes the movie pleasant is the well written narrative, added with the good execution team.
What did not work:
I would have been happier if the lead character's entrepreneurship had its roots in the movie or had scenes that made us believe that he is a brilliant mind that he eventually becomes. We did have some scenes illustrating his con nature and his ruthlessness, but not a clear idea of his genuineness. Maybe the scene where he plans to be a driver was one of them but still I was looking forward for some more. I am sure the novel had its moments regarding that.

Even the good reviewers will have to admit the reason he becomes wealthy.

43,sweidman-28016,Entertaining,7,10 February 2021,"""Rich men are born with opportunities they can waste.""I had an interest in The White Tiger ever since I saw the trailer. We even talked about it a couple months ago in one of my storytelling class - mainly just because the professor knows the director. In the movie, an ambitious Indian driver uses his wit and cunning to escape from poverty and rise to the top. It's an epic journey based on the New York Times bestseller. Maybe my hopes were too high, but I felt slightly let down. To start with what I liked, the story is interesting; equally comedic and thrilling. Adarsh Gourav is great in his role as Balram. He brings life to the screen with his optimism in both his character and acting. The ensemble is good. Ramin Bahrani does well directing and proves he can make a movie once again. You can see the passion out into this project.The movie has two distinct parts. The first being more lighthearted and the second more serious. For me, the first half worked better. I found it to be entertaining and fun. The second is fine, but I just didn't feel as entertained as the first. It is entertaining but the switch felt a little too dramatic for me to catch up with the tone. The script is still good throughout and I did want to know what was to come. Another critique I have that won't be a problem for anyone else probably is the aspect ratio. I could not tell you why but the choice for a 2:1 aspect ratio bugged me so much. Looking at the screen felt wrong, even if the cinematography looked good. I like how they captured the look of it, but I just didn't vibe with that aspect ratio. Also, the score for this is well done. Overall, I liked The White Tiger. I'm not exactly sure it was for me, but I'm sure most would like it.

50,markgorman,A tremendous insight into Indian caste culture.,9,7 February 2021,"Taken from the bestselling novel of the same name (I've not read it but I'm betting it's great), this Indian movie production by Netflix is tremendous.It features a terrific central performance by Ardash Gourav and stand out photography by Paolo Carnera that makes the most of its rural and Delhi based settinguption, comedy/tragedy and a central theme around class and privilege.India's caste system is put into a shameful spotlight that we don't often see in contemporary stories (something that tends to be pushed back into The Empire days).Here, the movie looks at the 90's and India's emerging tech industry as it follows the fortunes of a country servant boy (the spectacularly brilliant Ardash Gourav as Balram) as he inveigles his way into the life of his village's tyrannical landlords (call that owners in truth).The family has sent the youngest son to 'America' to be educated and he comes home with a head full of dreams, shock at the caste system and a trophy 'westernised' Indian bride who won't stand for the endemic sexism.Balram becomes his driver as he sets out on corruption trips to Delhi. Staying in gauche hotels Balram sleeps with the other servants in the basement carpark, another underworld of its own caste hierarchy.The movie mixes up humour (rapier like) with a real moral compass that has you ultimately searching your conscience on whether Balram's means of escape from poverty and subjection is justified (not a spoiler, he narrates the movie on-screen, from the off, from a position of wealth and power).To my mind. a far better depiction of contemporary Indian life (outside of Bollywood) than its stupendously successful comparator, Slumdog Millionaire.",The White Tiger

Director: Ramin Bahrani
Starring: Adarsh Gourav, Rajkummar Rao, Priyanka Jonas, Vedant Sinha, Vijay Maurya, Mahesh Manjrekar etcOverall rating 92/100The white tiger is about an ambitious Indian driver who uses his wit and cunning to escape from poverty and slavey and rise to the top of the of the class chain. What an excellently crafted movie The white tiger was, it has so many great moments so let's get started.First of all, I loved the movies cinematography and representation as well as the great set up and narrative structure. The movie looked visually phenomenal, it had insanely creative and beautiful mise en scene, the rich colour palette of the movie was beautiful, whilst also having excellent set locations highlighting the contrast of the two conflicting classes based on the movies themes very well. I also loved the representation of the movie, having a completely Indian cast was an excellent choice and I just loved that India shone in such a beautiful way showing the beautiful landscapes and different actions and rituals of the people really was fascinating and amazing to watch for me. I also loved the set up and general narrative structure of the movie, I loved that the movie started with Balram (Adarsh Gourav) when he has gotten his wealth and power reflecting on his story of how he got to where he was it set up the main plot of the story really well and the fact that they kept on going back to Balram in the present was a really great part of the movie for me.My next few positives would be the voice over, deep themes, script and performances. I really liked the use of voice over for the main character, it was a really effective and impactful narrative technique that developed the main character well and just established his personality a lot more so this was very effective storytelling. I also loved the deep themes that this movie explored. The class divide in India was shown in great depth it was absolutely disgusting to see the contrast between the poor and the rich parts of the country and how the rich had complete control over everyone and there was no escape from them. The way Balram's master and his family treated him was awful they treated him like dirt and talked to him like he wasn't even a human, this was very impactful and truly built an uncomfortable and tense tone, and it really shone a light on the class divide that is still happening in the world. I also thought this movies script was fantastic. Not only was it excellently crafted and written but the dialogue was truly powerful, certain lines about being stuck in a chicken coop were powerful and really stood out to me, the way the dialogue was so often a larger metaphor for the whole of society within India and the awful class divide was excellently done. I also have to say the performances in this movie were fantastic the whole cast did a fantastic job. But in wow Adarsh Gourav was absolutely excellent, the depth and range he bought to his character was excellent, his performance got slowly more and more unsettling as the movie went on and I was very impressed.My only two negatives for the movie would be the rushed pacing and the lack of development to certain characters. I would say that despite the movies two hour screen time I felt like the movie had a lot of rushed pacing issues, it never truly stayed on one scene for a long period of time, this therefore impacted the movies emotional weight and impact of the more darker scenes, so it would have been nice to extend on some scenes and cut others just so the movie had that little bit more impact for me. I also thought that there was a lack of development for certain characters, I feel like the movie had a missed opportunity with the character of Ashok (Rajkummar Rao) I feel like the movie went in the wrong direction with his character, having him essentially turn out like his father was a bad creative decision in my opinion and it would have been a more satisfying character arc for both Ashok and Balram if they had worked together to overthrow his father and escape.My next few positives would be the character background, depth and development and the interesting main character. I loved the amount of background they gave to Balram, it really added to the impact and made the audience understand Balram and why he would take in order to get more money, taking him back to his roots and showing his family was a great touch and added needed depth to Balram making him want to escape the poverty. The character depth and development of Balram was also fantastic, the way Balram was treated by his masters got worse and worse and the amazing dialogue of Balram wanting to escape the chicken coop was just excellent, his character developed and became more independent and fought for himself as the movie went on which was excellent. Balram was just a fascinating character as well, he sometimes didn't make the most amazing decisions and even antagonist ones in places, but he was a fascinating character study and represented a bigger message of the class conflict and even the slavery that technically still happens today raising key issues.My final few positives would be the building of tension, plot twists,as well as the great ending. The movie did an excellent job at raising the stakes and building the tension, this was largely due to the lead performance being so convincing, but the movie slowly got more and more uncomfortable and tense to watch as the stakes of other peoples actions and how they effected Balram got increased and this was excellently done, the movie also had excellently executed plot twists, the movie genuinely had twists that I didn't see coming with the family and Balram, these twists served purpose to the plot due to the audience being able to sympathise with Balram and it shocked me at how much power they had over him as a character therefore making his character arc of escaping feel well earned. Finally, I thought the ending was excellent, having to finally see Balram be wealthy and successful and start a taxi/driver business of his own, but paying his workers well and treating them with respect was a great juxtaposition of how the upper class treated the lower class, this was a very satisfying and powerful arc for Balram as despite him now being rich he knows what its like to have nothing.Overall, the white tiger may not be as impactful as it could have been due to a couple of character and pacing issues. But nonetheless is an excellently written, powerfully acted movie that really dives deep into the class divide that the world still has.",The White Tiger
53,msunando,A rebellion to break away from the rooster coop,8,24 January 2021,"Rooster coop is a metaphorical definition of the centuries of oppression and persecution of the economically backward section of a society by the rich, in which the oppressed refuse to put their head up and break away from. In India, it is a deeply etched psychological state that is comfortably prevalent, and even if an upward churn among the two segments takes place, newer members fill in the void underneath.White Tiger directed by Ramin Bahrani is the cinematic adaptation of Arvind Adiga's Booker Prize winning novel. It tells the story of the rooster coop that begins in an underdeveloped village called Laxmangarh in Bihar, and then traverses through Dhanbad, Delhi and culminates in Bangalore. White Tiger is a metaphor too, it represents Balham Halwai (Adarsh Gourav) and his single minded determination to break away from the rooster coop at any cost and change his own destiny. It is a deep throated cry of anguish against the exploitation of the poor and uneducated by the rich.Adarsh Gourav is exceptionally convincing in the role of Balham, and the transformation from the village underdog, to being the driver to a super rich family and the eventual entrepreneur who shapes his own destiny in utterly believable. Rajkummar Rao as the scion of the rich family caught between the hierarchical pressure and nuovo idealism is impressive. Priyanka Chopra Jonas has a brief yet high impact essay. White Tiger is an easy going but not a frothy film, and it may make you sit up and take sides about the legitimacy of actions of each character.",The White Tiger

A story of one poor man, bettering himself whilst always remaining poor, and his attempt to jump the gap, doesn't provide many characters to enjoy watching. No one can be seen as the 'good guy' in a system which promotes such disparity, but The White Tiger creates justifications for horrendous acts. It is a long film, but that is necessary to build the character and the social context within. The first hour or so is interesting without quite being engaging, but one pivotal moment completely switches the tone of the film and makes it utterly engrossing. The switch between English and Hindi is good without stunting the flow, and the visual scenery paints a picture outside of the plot. Although the ending is a little so-so, The White Tiger is a really brilliant film in a different culture, which makes you uneasy until the end.",The White Tiger

You don't emote for the Rajkumar Rao (or) Priyanka Chopra's character though they have performed well as the character is only told to the audience through Balram's voice over like a novel and not established visually.

61,madhukar30,Brilliantly Mauled by a Tiger !!,8,24 January 2021,"American kids grow up believing they can be president. But in India, aspirations, like so many of its people, are modest at the best. The struggle for most Indians isn't to climb the social ladder, but to maintain their position on it. Through a poisonous cocktail of fear and religion, we are indoctrinated early in life to accept our stations, constantly reminded that there is always going to be someone above us, waiting to pounce, and someone below, prepared to be pounced at. The lead character, Balram makes a similar analogy in the film, when he compares 99% of India's population to roosters trapped in a coop. They can smell the blood, he says, they know what fate has in store for them. But not one of them tries to escape.Aided by some fantastic cinematography, The white tiger takes off almost where slum dog millionaire left a decade ago. Though I have not read the book, the Adapted screenplay I felt was adequate enough to set the thought process spinning. Editing was neat and crisp without any hiccups whatsoever. Production design, costumes, makeup and music were rock solid, and free of errors. On the acting front Adarsh Gaurav delivers a fantastic performance as Balram, ably supported by Raj kumar rao and others. Notably there are some minor errors like the models of cars and advertising hoardings as the movie is supposed to take place in the early to mid 2000s.Overall, The White Tiger is a hot boiling pot that is ready to trickle down at the slightest provocation. It is a must watch movie for all Indians who have lived through the era of economic change. Full credit to the director Ramin Bahrani for weaving magic on the screen, especially for bringing out the frustration, anger and aspirations of the poor and the suppressed. But I don't agree or endorse with the method used in achieving the goal, but alas these sort of things happen right under our noses every day. 7.9 stars out of 10 for this highly provocative and a technically brilliant film.",The White Tiger

I also think the movie is pretty well acted for the most part, giving what the actors were given.But, well, the execution didn't quit landed for me. I thought the narration aspect of it got really really tiring after not much time at all. As a whole I think using narration in film can be tricky, in some situations I really love it, and in others it feels like an easy way out, for when you don't exactly know how to show the audience what the characters are feeling.And well I thought the result here, for the most part, was a pretty convoluted movie, with so much exposition at all times from the main character, basically narrating the entire story for us. Like, for real, for the first hour of the movie, it felt like there wasn't a 5-minute period where the voice over didn't show up to explain what was happening on screen. And that lost me pretty much entirely tbh.So, to sum up, I don't think there is much more I wanted to say, the acting is good, the cinematography and stuff is fine too, I like the concept, but the way the movie was structured just lost me for the most part, it felt distant, and most of the time, a some what easy way to tell what the character was literally thinking, instead of treating the audience like smarter people, and just letting us figure it out for ourselves.

Breaking old school routines and creating a new society, from the inside out. People living in rich countries and societies forget or are uneducated to how third countries operate. Big corporations take advantage of their resources and working class. This happens in our own communities and nations too.

No Spoilers as its a new film though an old book :-)The plot holds the interest though the narration is a tad slow here and there. The sets, the acting, cinematography etc are mostly good. Adarsh Gourav is brilliantly cast and very effective as the highly intelligent Bihari lad Balram, from a so called 'lower' caste, poor family who becomes a 'servant' and driver, then a successful entrepreneur to use his words. The circumstances, the mentalities, what transpires thereafter form the plot.Balram looks and acts like the typical Bihari house help one might come across in any Indian metro city.

75,arabnikita,You will have to perceive it in your own way,7,5 February 2021,"I felt very conflicted while watching this film. I have been to India and saw both the luxury and the slums. As I drove past the poverty, I wondered how do the poor people actually make it out and frankly, it's not how I expected it to be. On one side, I liked how the movie was made in terms of style, pacing and the multitude of spot on details when it comes to conversations and mannerisms. On the other side, I was in utter confusion as to why is it glorifying the main character. The movie was trying to make Balram look like The Wolf of Wall Street while in reality he was more like Tony Montana; maybe even worse.There is nothing wrong with having a protagonist who achieves his success through backstabbing and hustling but in this case, the movie has to show the audience that he is in essence a ""bad guy"". Here the case is different. Yes, Balram came from nothing and worked hard to break out of the ""rooster coop"" but the way he did it is not something that should be exemplified. We are presented with the narrative which shows him as an ""entrepreneur"" who escapes the servant life while in reality he is a despicable person who stops at nothing.As a movie, The White Tiger feels like an Indian story made for Western audience. It is certainly an intriguing watch as it has an interesting plot and the style to make it engaging. However, the closer we get to the end, the more naive and simplistic everything becomes. Considering that the movie is narrated as a letter to the PM of China, we expect it to have a substantial effect; in reality, it amounts to nothing.

Each and every scene is written as a social commentary mainly more than a story and the script makes it worse. In real life no politician especially women politicians do not use such vulgar language in public or when with other influential people in India. Drivers in the last 20 years would not even agree to love in the kind of conditions shown or accept such behaviour let alone name calling and abuses.

The White Tiger, also succeeds with an intelligent direction to enhance the story itself, told by impeccable actors with considerable praise for Adarsh Gourav, who with this role proves to be meticulous and versatile, succeeding to manage a heavy climax full of details, not only behavioral, but above all emotional.

85,i_odin,An Indian story made for a western audience,6,23 January 2021,"The White Tiger belongs to the class of cinema which is being told by a breed of not-so-Indian storytellers who seems to understand Indian problems. Sometimes they miss and sometimes they hit bullseye. This film is somewhere in between.
If you go by the story, then you know this film is quintessentially Indian telling the story in a way so as to engage the western audience also. And by doing so, it somehow abandons that Indian audience.
As an indian, there are far more superior quality cinema already made (most of them in regional cinemas) who tackles this subject with not just more sincerity but also with a heart. This film is often fails to do so and seems soulless. But having said that unfortunately AND fortunately this film will get a greater acceptance in the west because it presents the story in a way the West understands the problem.
For instance, a small trivial detail might not matter to a western audience but the fact that the Stork even with his vast wealth and cultural superiority complex decides to travel in a sleeper class (or could easily be just General Class) of a train can and will erk an Indian audience. But for a Westerner that is just an exotic scene describing ""how Indians travel"".
Same applies to the caste divide. For some foreigner the fact that one character is upper caste and the other is lower caste is enough for them to (have the illusion that they) understand India's vast cultural divide. But for an Indian that's just gross simplification.As I said these are just trivial details but they explain so much more about the intent of the makers.

Priyanka Chopra and Rajkumar Rao were decent as well in their supporting roles. The story is narrated in an interesting way, in the form on an email, as we go back and forth in time a little bit. Decent background scores and some good cinematography as well.Starting the movie from the end and going back in time is a hit/miss IMO. It takes an element of surprise (The WHAT is gonna happen) out of the equation and leaves only The HOW (is it gonna happen) for the viewer to find out which opens the door for predictability, unless it's told in a certain way and has twists and turns. Looking back, the trailer and the first 15 mins of the movie revealed way too much IMO, maybe that's just me. But there was enough anticipation for the HOW part. Predictable but good.
Even though everyone seems to say this reminds them of Parasite and how the movie is about India's caste system and the socio-economic status (and i see why people say that) I don't think that's necessarily the case, but sure certain segments portray the ""Rich get richer, and the poor get poorer"" part well.For an American director making an Indian movie, this movie did a waaay better job with stereotypes. Slumdog was so tiring and annoying. This one on the other hand, had regular accents, showed both sides of the coin more than the other one did. In fact, this movie even takes a jab at Slumdog. But I'm sure some people will be rubbed the wrong way at the misrepresentation of the Indian society in this movie as well, you decide if they're right or wrong.

Not surprising, since any movie chronicling the rise of the underdog is bound to find favour with common audiences. (The film about a well to do couple and their faithful servant reminds me of the classic Hindi film Sahib, Bibi Aur Ghulam). The servant in this case is however loyal only to a point and has negative shades.Set in India and based on a famous book, it has a superb screenplay. The film has a flawless performance by Adarsh Gourav who lives the role of the very poor and ambitious villager ( Balram) who manipulates matters to establish himself as the chauffeur to the USA returned businessman Ashok (Rajkummar Rao).The film has focused on the socio economic set up in India, the caste system, the poor/ rich, the corrupt police/ politicians etc. So young Balram learns the ropes to help him rise up the ladder by hook or by crook. The premise of the film is that one can achieve anything by bribing high level politicians and that one can buy the silence of the police in exchange for a bagful of cash. Showing that crime does pay makes me feel that there is some flawed thinking here.It is paradoxical that some of the best screenplays collapse when the climax is conceptualised and this is one such case where the ending is tame and a sort of an anticlimax.

96,levybob,Gripping. Sensational story telling. As Non-Hollywood as you can get.,10,15 February 2021,"I found 'White Tiger' difficult to watch over its first fifteen minutes. The poverty, filth, violence .... were it not for my wife's willingness to hang-in with it I'd have turned it off. And I am glad that I did not.I'm a big fan of how a story is told. The 'how' often more important that the 'what', and 'White Tiger' is masterfully told. Early on we sense where the film is going but we have no idea of the road which will take us to that climactic scene. 'White Tiger' also teases us with a 'Who'; a crime has been committed against someone but the identity of that victim is held close to the vest for much of the film. And though we don't know, we are so invested in the film's main-character - 'the driver' - that this 'who' is enough to keep us glued to the film.I say that 'White Tiger' is Non-Hollywood. For much of my seventy-seven years Hollywood films have been defined by good winning-out over evil. Sure there are exceptions; Woody Allen's 'Match Point' for one. But we'd be hard pressed to find many more. And, in fact, 'White Tiger' takes a similar path and in doing so throws the viewer into a reality as real as real gets.Much has been written (here) about the film's painting a picture of India which is unfair. And, in truth, though I have visited the country, I cannot attest to the truth or falsity of the film's depiction. What I can say is this. The story can as easily have been shot in and told about other countries; Western countries as well as those of the 'Third World'. A story of a rise out of poverty. A story of the choices one has to make in order to rise. A story of the compromises required. These are not questions related to India alone. Not at all.Life is to be lived.
Life is unfair.
But who exactly is to say what truly is fair?See this film.",The White Tiger

99,Waedliman,A real gem,8,8 February 2021,"There are films that should not be underestimated, because they are more complex than they first appear. While ""Parasite"" was completely overrated, ""The White Tiger"" is a pearl that must be discovered. Based on a novel, the real-life situation in India at the beginning of the capitalist awakening is also a parable of false democracy, corrupt socialism, a society of castes in which the only chance, as Balram, the main character himself, puts it, is to become a criminal or enter politics. He shows that it is not possible any other way, how much sympathy you give him as an audience member is something everyone has to decide for themselves. Adarsh Gourav will have to be kept in mind, his transformation from victim to perpetrator, slit-eyed and calculating, the rise from slum dweller to entrepreneur has ironic features, is always believable and played very precisely in its sheer casualness.

So much so that in the climax of the story, it gave justification to Balram's escape from this ""chicken coop"" of impoverishment by brutally murdering the one employee that was kind to him and leading to the mass murder of his entire extended family of 15-20, including the brother he grew up with, the grandmother that more than once in the movie made him his favorite meal, and an assortment of women, children, and even infants, all for the sum of 400,000 rupees or equivalent of $5,495 in which he used to bribe the police and started his own crime syndicate.Masterful.",The White Tiger

I was expecting a 'Slumdog' millionaire story, but it ended up more like 'Parasites' alas not as good as any of them.I would say it is worth watching the movie just for the acting of Priyanka Chopra (the sassy American wife) and Adarsh Gourav (Baldam) and to learn about the culture of India, but the story itself falls a bit short for me, especially towards the end of the movie. What was working in the book might not transfer well to the big screen, but at least the directing, acting and filming is done very well here.Overall if you are curious I would recommend giving this movie a shot, but it's not the masterpiece some reviewers would make you believe.

108,blackoutH,It's all about interpretation and audience,9,2 April 2021,"After a recommendation and an Oscar nomination I decided to check out the White Tiger, I didn't have much expectation besides the fact that it seemed from the footage I'd seen, that it would tackle some social economic issues in Indian society.Contrary to a lot of the critics I didn't found the movie to promote hate or a negative message at all, I won't spoil much but what I saw was the depiction of several dark and heavily rooted social issues, and a main character that goes against the tide and moves away from oppression.If all movies were to be taken literally we would be in very bad shape, there are tons of political and social critic movies that depict exaggerated violence even though they are actually sending a message against hate, oppression and discrimination, it's just a matter of how you receive the message.I don't claim to know all the issues happening in other countries, these days by watching the news we don't get a real depiction of reality, so I don't agree at all with the critics I've seen from people saying that it's not that good because it targets Western audiences as it doesn't touch into a serious and deeper subject - I understand where they are coming from, and I do agree that this might be ""westernized"" movie, but I believe that's actual positive as it makes people exposed to such issues that a majority might not know and it actually might get them more engaged and research on them after watching the movie.Movies are an art form, you can entertain people, touch them, push them to think and make them aware of new realities, same as Parasite from last year, it also tackles a social issues yet in its majority it was highly acclaimed for the craftsmanship and the way it was made and I feel the same towards White Tiger, sure maybe it has mainly an entertainment core yet it also puts out into the world a brutal and probably unknown reality of India, so for that I believe it deserves praise!",The White Tiger
109,xpics,Superlative performance but pretentious filmmaking!,5,12 February 2021,"'The White Tiger' is a stereotypical English film in an Indian setup where all possible popular cliches and notions relating to India are highlighted to the hilt, most prominently the social inequality and how the rich and the poor despise each other. Not that the divide doesn't exist in India - it certainly does. But when a foreign filmmaker chooses to handpick elements from India to cater particularly to a foreign audience (evident with every local character speaking in chaste English), the film seems to come with an agenda of its own. With the likes of similar setup films winning Oscar in the past - be it 'Slumdog Millionaire' or 'Parasite', 'The White Tiger' comes across as a pretentious formula film in its own right!Even if you were to completely ignore the cultural overtones and analyse the film purely from its story point of view, 'The White Tiger' still has glaring inconsistencies, which one just cannot overlook. Here is a poor boy from the village who wants to make it big. All he wishes is to be the driver of a rich family in the city. Call it coincidence or convenience in writing but the family opens their door (literally) for him to be their chauffeur. He is typically treated like a servant from the father and son of the family, which he is quite accustomed to in his upbringing. However the foreign-return younger son (Rajkumar Rao) and his NRI wife (Priyanka Chopra) treat him like equal. Even if you turn a blind eye to the blatant and banal manipulation of the characterizations, how can one overlook the insipidity of the storyline.The real story actually kicks off only when the rich wife and husband run over a poor child under their car and the underprivileged driver has to take the blame on himself - despite nobody being a witness to the accident! Further the story keeps beating round and round the bush until the poor is pushed against the wall to the extent that he decides to take on the rich. Firstly the film takes too long to come to its point. Moreover when it finally does, it just doesn't move forward and gets into a repetitive loop of ill-treatment of the poor driver.In the final reels (or what you may call as the third act of the screenplay), the tonality and genre suddenly changes from a social statement film to a rags-to-riches story. The driver suddenly makes it big, spearheading a driver recruitment company of his own. But the journey is never ever shown and his change in social status is far from believable. At a sub-textual level, the film tries to show how a poor man who hated the rich, turned into a rich man who is, more or less, an image of what he hated the most. But then at another level, the film also whitewashes his rich character showing how he is taking care of the poor ala Robinhood! And somewhere between the subtext and the satire, the film turns convoluted and pretentious.Not that the film has nothing worth lauding about. The performance by Adarsh Gourav as the central character is impeccable. Rajkumar Rao and Priyanka Chopra 'literally' take a backseat while Gourav drives the film!Unfortunately just a superlative performance cannot make up for the absence of a cohesive storyline!",The White Tiger
110,severindringel,A social critique that looks spectacular but too often loses itself in its creativity,8,13 April 2021,"The Bollywood hit 2021 has found itself very early in the year. Ramin Bahrami's The White Tiger is a social drama that first comes up with mostly comedic moments until it suddenly makes a 180° turn towards the end and becomes a thriller. The focus is on the relationship between good and evil. This is explored by the poor farmer Balram, who wants to make more out of his life and hires on as a chauffeur for a filthy rich family. After a promising start, he gets caught in the crossfire after a tragic accident and is confronted with betrayal, inequality and inner demons.The lead role of Balram is embodied by Adarsh Gourav, who carries the film from start to finish. His performance is incredibly complex. One moment he is the polite, always saying ""sir"" chauffeur who doesn't allow himself a verbal lapse. After the slightest trigger, however, he is immediately of a different mind and radiates anger and egoism. These aspects, however, only become apparent in Balram's individual scenes. In interactions with other, socially higher placed characters, he only shows his best side and lets himself be humiliated, which is quite hard to watch at times. Gourav is constantly the centre of the film and the story is told exclusively from his perspective. Even he is the narrator of the film for the entire running time and the events are shown in his accompanying voice via flashbacks. His chemistry with Raj Yadav, who plays his spoilt billionaire boss Ashok, is actually always very amical. In some scenes, however, Ashok's arrogance gets the better of him and he suddenly treats Balram like dirt. This triggers some emotions in the latter, which Gourav displays imposingly with his brilliant facial expressions. On Yadav's side, Priyanka Chopra plays Jonas Ashok's wife Pinky. Although she has an Indian background, she is never really comfortable in India and constantly wants to persuade her husband to return to America. Although their chemistry is by no means cold, Chopra Jonas is quite pitiful in this role. She feels oppressed by the wealth of her husband's family and, despite her much higher profile, always has a very special connection with Balram as a result.The White Tiger is a clear critique of the social differences in India. It is never too shy to show these openly. Told in incredibly fast sequences at the beginning, the film unfortunately slows down at the end. It almost seems like a different film due to the additional change of genre, but always remains true to its general narrative structure. This abstractness, however, harbours some weaknesses. One notices that Bahrami runs out of steam in terms of creativity in the last third. After images and sequences that we have rarely seen before, the ending in particular seems very conservative and forced. It's almost disappointing when you think back to how grandiose the build-up to that point was. Moreover, due to the absolute focus on Balram, the secondary characters are often left out and sometimes disappear completely from the scene. However, one has to give Bahrami credit for completely separating himself from the mainstream in his basic idea - even if this does not always succeed in the implementation. The White Tiger is definitely an important film in its message, delivers phenomenal acting performances and is a visual firework.",The White Tiger
111,clivejamesrd,This is must-see cinema . . . bravo Netflicks.,8,23 January 2021,"This movie sheds light on a few very typical aspects of Indian culture, but I don't want to tip over into spoiler territory so I won't discuss any of those aspects here. However having lived and worked in India for over 13 yrs and traveled extensively, except for the N.E. corner, I know what I'm talking about
The movie is very well done, plotting, directing, writing, acting, casting, all very well executed. Simultaneously entertaining and illuminating.

112,mr_sharma,Probably one of the best films I have seen this year,9,3 March 2021,"Having just watched the excellent ""I care a lot"" on Netflix, I didn't expect this (white tiger) to have been as good.Honestly, I was thinking, it's going to do what a plethora of Indian Netflix dramas are doing. Showing the seedy side of India. Guns. Violence etc etc.Which is all good, if it's the first time you see it but gets a little boring when you see it again and again.And yet, this film defies that.I haven't read the book but I loved the metaphorical nature of this story.From the idea of the relationship between servant and master to waking up and being the white tiger. Entrepreneurship requires you to simply open the door you always believed was locked.I am an Indian and have often thought of this repressive nature of India society. How the game is rigged to deny so little opportunity to people born at the wrong place and time.The film makes some great points.The trailer makes it sound more horrific than it actually is.The story is one of journey. Those that are given everything and never fulfill (and here I am writing this instead of a screenplay) and those who have nothing and seize the opportunity.As a piece of film making goes, this is absorbing and engrossing cinema.Highly recommended.Be the white tiger. Wake up!",The White Tiger
113,jcarlos-96740,Wrong message? I don't think so,7,30 January 2021,"First of all I might say that production and acting wise this movie is impeccable. The controversy here seems to be about the message that the movie sends. I don't think that this sends an evil message that the poor must kill the rich in order to succeed, no, we must not forget that this is simply a movie and that is also based on a best selling book. Now about Balram actions, we see him being bullied and despised throughout the entire movie, we see that his family only cared about his money and marriage and not really about his feelings or desires. The trap of poverty is what we see in India, everyone is unable to create wealth because the people surrounding are all poor and even if you are lucky enough to get a good job like Balram did they controlled him by forcing him to take the blame for the murder and menacing his family life if he stole, and then after years of work you get too options either you save enough to buy a home or you become homeless, but they can fire you at anytime if they want to like they were about to do with Balram. Now I understand that the master that he killed was the most decent one to him but I dare to say that was impossible for Balram to become rich without killing his master and you must look at things from his perspective as well. First, at the end he was stealing from him with false invoices and got a significantly good amount of money given by Pinky but even in that situation he hadn't got enough to simply quit and start is own business. Second, he was going to get replaced and after that we can assume that we was going to get a more precarious job and start to afford less and we all saw how he lived precariously working for rich people. Third, his family only wanted his money and to marry him and weren't able to help monetarily. Fourth, we clearly see the effect of that lifestyle on Balram, towards the end of the movie he is starting to loose his mind after going through all that and obviously that influenced his decision to kill. So taking this in consideration his only way to escape the cicle was by killing his master, steal the millions from him, change is name and appearance and start his business.For the people complaining about the confession letter that they had off him and about the fact that the master family didn't go after him he explains in the movie that the only reason that he didn't get caught was because his appearance could be of a lot of average Indian men and he also changed his name so if they were looking for a Balram they wouldn't find him, and he also says that he can be caught one day but it was all still worth it to see how it is to not be poor.Now the fun part is that at the end, after breaking his cycle of poverty he becomes just like the people that did him wrong because the only reason why his business succeeded was because he bribed the police and acquired some control over them, also becoming a corrupt himself. The good part is that he treated his employees respectfully and took blame for them actions unlike his former masters.Now you guys can interpret that the message of this movie is in order to be rich you must kill, but I see a much deeper meaning than that. The system is corrupt, the politics were bribed on a daily basis, the rich treated poor people like trash controlling their lives and not caring about their problems, poor people lived on precarious conditions lacking health cares and decent living conditions, the message is that this oppressive system creates people like Balram that tired of being treated wrong and knowing that the future didn't had nothing great for him he did the only thing that in his thinking was his choice. We don't need to educate people to not kill their bosses in order to become rich, everybody knows that murder is not the correct way, what we need is to change the system in order to make people not even consider that possibility, by creating conditions that allows everyone to live a decent life despite everything else. Balram is a product of the system, the big message is: we must change the system!",The White Tiger

119,theshanecarr,The dark side of Slumdog Millionaire,8,23 February 2021,"I've spent some time in India, and I have yet to see a movie where I see the glaring chasm of inequality I saw there accurately displayed. Admittedly I have only seen a handful of Bollywood movies but they all paint a glossy picture of the India as lived in by the rich.Slumdog Millionaire did try to show something of the life for the other half, but it was still a rose-tinted version in which true love and fate would conquer all. (With some amazing dancing.)Based on the Booker prize-winning book by Aravind Adiga (the bright cover of which had me picking it up and nearly buying quite a few times), and adapted for the screen and directed by Ramin Bahrani, The White Tiger depicts something of the horror of extreme poverty. Not so much the grinding, dirty everyday reality (though we see a little of that), but the constant humiliation visited upon those who have grabbed a small, small reprieve from the worst extremes and now must obsequiously bow and scrape to their masters, upon whose favour they are so reliant.Adarsh Gourav plays Balram, a man from a poor village who becomes second driver to a wealthy and corrupt family. There's something a little similar here to Parasite in the way a poor family latches on to a wealthy one in a horrific yet symbiotic relationship. Here, Balram identifies the more liberal, American-educated Ashok (played convincingly wetly by Rajkummar Rao) as the master for him, and he determines to become a good servant for him, convinced they will rise together.Ashok, and his American-Indian wife (Priyanka Chopra Jonas) are more conscious of Balram's suffering, but even their liberal concern has hard limits.
The movie is chiefly interested with how Indian society is structured so as to keep the poor in constant subservience to the rich, and how, as Balram learns how India's great democracy really functions, he realises he too will have to play dirty if he is going to get ahead.
There is a framing device in which Balram is writing his story into an email to the Chinese Prime Minister in advance of the premier's visit to India, and the film hints at India itself being like Balram - a smiling servant happy to take Chinese or American money but always learning how the game is played, and ready to plunge a knife in if need be.The smile that Balram gives throughout the movie becomes so noticeable. No matter the insult or the compliment, he always smiles blankly at his masters, playing the happy, compliant servant. It is only in his voice-over that we know that his disillusionment is growing, and in occasional scenes of his after-hours exploits that we see how he is cracking up.The film is full of wonderful detail; the pressure from the grandmother to get married, the touching of elders feet to denote respect, the cows in the road, the delight Balram takes in looking down on those even lower than he, the way an American education has changed some young Indian's perception of what is right. These accumulating details create an immersive sense of this ""other"" land, and combined with the fast paced editing, and propulsive score lend the film a sense of energy. This sense of energy can't quite cover up some pacing issues. The film sags in the middle as Balram bears witness to more and more evidence of the rich family's worthlessness, but the film doesn't progress the plot much further until a final burst of action in the last 15 minutes.As an entertaining, darkly funny spin through a culture we in the west don't get much insight into, this tiger comes out a winner.",The White Tiger
120,mayurpanchamia94,Hmm,7,22 January 2021,"The White Tiger by Arvind Adiga won the Man Booker Prize, directed by American - Iranian Ramin Bahraini is a story dealt differently. Although it does have few drawbacks it still manages to engage with a good performance.Eat or get eaten up.

3. The performances are good. Adarsh gourav shines in the lead role of Balram. Rajkumar Rao didn't shine because his role wasn't that great and Priyanka Chopra couldn't shine as her role was too small. They need to be appreciated for taking supporting roles in spite of being big stars. Due to them, this film will reach lots of people who wouldn't have watched this film otherwise. Vijay Maurya made me hate him through his great acting although his role was small. Mahesh Manjrekar was wasted.

I was extremely disappointed in the performance of the beautiful Priyanka Chopra.Amazon, Apple and Hulu turn out marvelously entertaining movies and television (see The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, Tehran, Fleabag, Greyhound, The Morning Show, One Night in Miami, Goliath, etc.). But Netflix continues to churn out ultra-violent slosh! No wonder the government of India is up in arms against the movie deals that Netflix is making.

Main problem with the movie is that I dont like the main character. Even though he acts «immoral» as some reviewers claim, thats not the issue to me. In a movie you would like to root for the hero, or the anti hero.
I understand that the subject matter is, and is supposed to be, very dark, but the movie is boring, and you dont get much relief from the ending.
I would like to point out that he actually does have some redeeming qualities about him, once at the end (finally!).

157,hellohimaank,Movie belongs to Adarsh,6,4 February 2021,"This movie is based on Aravind Adiga's bestseller and Booker Prize-winning novel where it attempts to address the contrast between class division and India's rapid economic evolution. I remember someone gifted me this book and I enjoyed it a lot. Sadly, I could say the same about the movie.There are many parts where I thought of this Korean masterpiece- Parasite that came last year. A movie that swept the Oscars and brilliantly showcases the class division.Adarsh- The new kid on the block is the real show-stealer here and it was so good to see him playing the miserable and also, the naive part with such conviction. His frustration, happiness, sadness look believable. A scene where he is scolding an old lady asking for money was a good surprise. The reason why you will like him is that he blends in every scene and scenario.Priyanka has also acted well and I guess, this is her best since Dil Dhadkne Do. Her role is well written and she manages to add the right amount of depth.Rajkumar, on the other hand, leaves no major impact as there is no punch in his role. A role of a loser. A role of a spineless person but he failed to bring that dumbness and numbness on the screen. The scenes where he is drunk are the worst. I guess he was trying hard to act like an NRI that did not work. And his accent is another sour point.You can feel the losing grip as we head towards the second half of the movie. The Director took a lot of time to show us real action and build up. Further, the end is nothing like the beginning as it has no punch to make a solid impact.In the end, I recommend this one for Adarsh and Priyanka only. We have seen this in India. We have seen this story of rags to riches a million times. We have seen the class divide a lot so, until there something grippy or striking that the moviemakers have to offer us, will keep on surfing one title after another.",The White Tiger

At one point in the film you can actually hear Balram references Slumdog Millionaire when he says he cant get out of this by winning a million rupees on a game show. I think it's important to note that being similar to other films is not a bad thing. Originality is overrated, everyone gets their inspiration from somewhere.I found The White Tiger to be an entirely satisfactory movie. All the actors were strong, particularly Ardash Gourav. It's not the most memorable movie, but held my attention. My real problem came with the ending which looked like it was going somewhere, and then took a turn for the underwhelming.The White Tiger is the type of movie you watch on a rainy day.

It seemed like a promising movie but ended suddenly with no satisfaction.
The whole movie seemed like you were waiting for something exciting to happen and nothing happens until right close to end the protagonist decides to murder the only guy who was good to him mostly and gets away with it, and forms a driving business...!

161,sanda_moroianu,"Not Bollywood, but neither Hollywood",7,26 January 2021,"Reading through the reviews, one can easily notice which are written by Indian viewers and which aren't. This is indicative of the rating, the critical approach and the overall evaluation, so it came as a surprise that some of the best/ worst ratings came from Indians. Being neither Indian, nor westerner, but from a country which has next to nothing to do with the Indian culture and ways of life, I always look for movies which could help me advance in understanding such a different country. In spite of the numerous scenes depicting Indian life realistically, on the whole the film gives somehow the sensation of superficiality, just like a tourist who spends two weeks traveling around monasteries and other places of worship and returns home with the firm belief that they fully grasped Indian philosophy and they are better for it.
I chose to consider this film as a bitter satire of how to advance in the world when one comes from an underprivileged environment- cast or no cast system: either by crime, which doesn't have to be literally murder, but sometimes it is, or by way of politics. And, guess what, it appears to be so in most cases, irrespective of country or culture.
This message could have been conveyed in less viewing time, definitely. There are moments which fail to convince- for instance the mighty Stork taking a train- albeit in first class. So does the sudden transformation from an enlightened upper class guy with studies in the States to a vulgar, classical mobster of the younger brother. Also, the sudden burst of violence of the protagonist, otherwise a leacherous character who tries to break the cast walls through smooth talking and absolute obedience.
In spite of all of the above, White Tiger is worth watching for the numerous moments that bring one closer to a different world and for the performances of Ardash Gourav and Priyanka Chopra.",The White Tiger

The male lead did a fantastic role in portraying someone from the lower caste through his expressions and conduct. I could feel how aggrieved and helpless he was and he even hated the fact that he was already used to being a servant. The Indian caste system is the prominent theme of this movie- how hard it was for the poor to reach the top. This movie shows how people lose their naivety and original pure intentions and change as they are slowly being 'moulded' by their environment.Actually I do wonder why did Ashok wanna replace Balram with another driver?

However the story lacked depth , its a linear story stretched for 2 hours ( without songs ) there have been , though you are waiting to see something different to happen, but nothing happens, just so predictable. May be the makers wanted it to be that way.
The story keeps you engaged throughout with an thrilling screenplay & out of the class acting, but at the end, you wonder was it worth for 2 hours.
As many have mentioned , there have been many more engaging movies on similar theme in regional and Bollywood earlier, hence nothing was knew for the Indian Audience . & for the West , This movie doesnt have even 10% of the impact iof Slumdog million or Parasite.",The White Tiger

And thats the exact thing you need to make you international film hit in hollywood. Take any country, show their poverty, their struggle and then finally somehow make everyone believe that you nation is bad, what you get is slumdog millionaire in 2008 and the white tiger in 2021.
Acting good (PC overacted, i still cant figure out why ? ),direction good, cinematography awesome but the fact that blame it on your government, religion and custom makes it again a propoganda movie.

I know India has huge issues with poverty and class systems, but is this really how it is? I'm not complaining. But I also don't want to pigeon-hole the country based on this movies portrayal.It's a harsh film highlighting the desperate plight of just one man among the MILLIONS of poor and starving in India and his desire to ascend... no matter the cost.The film followed the path of the book almost flawlessly.The story of Balram is definitley rags to riches. But it is certainly not ""feel good"" or glamorous. India is portrayed as a brutal country and if you are not wealthy or politically wired, you're existance is simply reduced to a waiting game with death as the end result.To sum it up in one phrase, this movie could be tagged; ""Dog eat dog."" Other reviewers expressed their disgust at the protagonists methods for success. But I also bet they've never been poor, let alone poor in India.You can discuss ethics and morality from the comfort of your lounge room/home theatre all you want.

196,CouchReview,The White Tiger(2021)- Review,8,25 January 2021,"The White Tiger is a drama film based on the book by Aravind Adiga of the same name. It is a story about Balram Halwai (Adarsh Gourav). Balram is born in a humble family with very few means or as stated in the movie in a 'Lower-Caste' family. Despite studying in a village he has quickly grasped the English language and envisions to study further and be a well-educated man unlike his family and this dream is further propelled when he is told he shall be given a scholarship to study in Delhi. But his fate had a different plan altogether. After his father's untimely demise he is forced to leave school and start working to pay off his family's debt. As time passes his dream of being educated stays a dream nowhere near his reality. Tired and fed up of his life in the village he wishes to step up the ladder by working in the city. The perfect opportunity comes along the way when he learns. Ashok (Rajkummar Rao the son of the village's landlord is on the lookout for a new driver. Ashok has just returned to India from The United States with his wife Pinky (Priyanka Chopra Jones), he has modern ideologies and evolved thinking unlike his father & brother, whom he constantly questions and asks to look beyond the caste system in India. With his wit and smart thinking he gets his wish and is hired as the driver for Ashok and his wife. Initially disappointed he finds his joy after the couple relocate to Delhi. Balram is happy and feels satisfied and creates a bond with his 'masters' who treat him with respect unlike others. While he believes he has achieved it all, earning fancily & doing a job none of his villagers could do, Pinky encourages him to be ambitious and reckons he can go much further in his life. Stubborn Balram continues to believe this is his destiny and serves his employers. But after that with a few unfortunate turn of events Balram realises he will no longer be a puppet in the hands of destiny and takes control of his fate. All this is showcased in the backdrop, narrated by Balram a successful entrepreneur, via his letters to the Chinese premier.
Ramin Bahrani has tried to create a film that can aptly portray the life & brutal reality of the sect of people who are mostly ignored. While he adapts the story from the book, he has done a good job writing the screenplay and an even better job directing the movie with a great outcome. The location setting and cinematography is also quite accurate giving the essence of the lifestyle of people from humble beginnings. The story is kept pretty much to the point and acted out at amazingly by Gourav and at a satisfactory level by Rao & Chopra Jonas.
While both the well acclaimed actors do a good job it is quite bizarre to see the two flaunting western accents, at least for Indian audiences who have seen the two in numerous Bollywood movies. If the two characters were played out by lesser known actors it could have been more enjoyable. The narrative style seems pointless and does not seem to add any value. With the narration a good anticipation is build that is expected to showcase Balram's rags to riches story, but the end is a let-down and even feels anticlimactic.
The end of the movie may not live up to standards but the rest is assuredly enjoyable and can be pleasant watch for most audiences. The movie can be disappointing but the story displayed is near perfect. It won't be the next Slumdog Millionaire (2008) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1010048/) nonetheless it is a delightful watch.

While the story is known if you have read the book, the direction and photography are a joy. So is the slick screenplay. An applause also to Rajkumar Rao and Priyanka Chopra for taking a back seat.

206,samsmiler-91682,Dark but beautifully enthralling tale of transformation. 0% Bollywood 👌,10,25 January 2021,"I love this movie. It's an eye opener. I feel like it expanded my emotional horizon. I intimately witnessed the transformation of Balram from this bright, pure-hearted boy in poor rural India into what he eventually evolved into-and without spoiling anything, he eventually did turn into something very different from what he started out as. Just a fascinating journey through another person's life.This is the magic of movies-being able to get a taste of what it's like to live another person's life and adventures.What's so impressive to me is that at no point did I feel like ""Nah, they've lost me with the story. Nobody would do this, nobody would think this, nobody would feel like this.""It always felt like: Yeah, given those circumstances, I totally get it. I get why he's doing what he's doing, feeling how he's feeling, thinking what he's thinking.The one thing I don't quite get about this movie is why they chose to tell the story through an email Balram writes to the Chinese Premier, because he hopes to make business with the Chinese in India. It doesn't take away from experiencing the masterful storytelling, but it didn't do anything and just seems like unnecessary narrative overhead.There's few movies set in India that I enjoy watching-I despise Bollywood movies, so I came with a bit of apprehension into this, but it was riveting right from the start and I completely lost myself in the storytelling. Now I'm gonna read the book.",The White Tiger

It is a rise, he warns, that is fraught with evil deeds, but defines him as a true entrepreneur, unlike many of his statesmen among the poor. Balram, in order to escape a life of hopelessness, arranged marriages, and poverty, has decided to become a driver for one of the wealthy and influential families in India. He enjoys driving the young couple, and even befriends them, but soon learns that having a servant's heart will not lead him out of poverty. In fact, despite occasional graciousness by those he serves, he is ultimately hated by those too far above his status to consider him human. A misstep by his masters sours him to his plight, and Balram discovers that it is time for the White Tiger to follow his nature.",The White Tiger

Highlight of the movie is excellent acting by Adarsh Gourav and direction by Ramin Bahrani.Movie is about the protagonist (Adarsh Gourav) who is from a poor lower caste family in rural India and how he manages to fight his way up the success ladder against some very tough odds.
Movie is quite serious and dark most of the time with an undertone of humor because of the way the story is narrated by the lead actor.

221,ravi-dadlani,The movie tries hard to have a 'Heart' but really ends up losing its 'Soul'...,7,27 January 2021,"It's a strange movie. On the one hand it seems well made on the other it seems to be wrapping a façade over the modern India society which it attempts to actually expose.
What's good: 1-The direction and editing are pretty powerful.
2- The good belong to Adarsh Gourav entirely. He did for White Tiger what
Pritesh Gandhi did for Scam 92. Phenomenal acting. Rajkumar Rao was
average in comparison (which is rare)
What should have been better
1- Little nuances in the movie: i) A driver from the village speaking English with
perfect diction and accent. Did he need to know English to be a White Tiger? A
very forced aspect of the film. ii) A street light signal which is on at 2 am on a
street which is not at an intersection? In India? and a local driver stops for a
red light at 2 am ???? iii) Everyone speaks to the driver in English- Really? The Stork and the mongoose travelling in a 3rd class of the railways. Really? Even the average middle class Indian opts for a 3 tier A/C. Air travel is much cheaper nowadays. Little details like this would irk the average Indian because it goes to show that a Billionaire in India stepping into an ordinary looking train and you talk about the great divide. I guess the Indian railways is the great equalizer. :)
The climax was very predictable.
The Western audience will love it as will the NRI audience who know India only through Bollywood.
The movie tries hard to have a 'heart' but really ends up losing its soul. I haven't read the book so I can't comment on the adaptation.
Could certainly have been better.",The White Tiger
222,Armando_Cassels,How To Get Ahead and Alienate People,8,9 April 2021,"This is an excellent movie into the social-economic, class and caste system in India. From what I believe the caste system is way more complex than described here, but none the less is a discriminatory system that is almost impossible to extricate oneself from. Here we have ambitious, but low caste Balram trying to throw of his low caste shackles and his connections to his family that he sees as holding him back. Balram goes to work for a wealthy, but corrupt family and puts up with a lot of abuse, criticism and bullying. The only shining light in the family is daughter in law Pinky who is beautiful and kind, but also out of place. Balram, inspired by the White Tiger of the title takes matters into his own hands to seek to realise his ambition. It's maybe a little too long, but the pacing and story are so good, you barely notice and some top notch performances from Gourav and Rao, ably supported by Chopra in a role that is a little contrived, but worth it to see her perform.",The White Tiger
223,berk_ozenc,I would recommend this movie.,7,31 January 2021,"I think it is a good movie with an interesting topic. I really liked how they adapted it to Indian culture. However, there are some things about the movie that made me upset. The movie sometimes remains very stable on one point and loses time. Thus, the tempo in the film drops in certain moments. There were some moments towards the end of the movie that I wished the film to focus on them more. I felt like some of the events at the end of the movie were quickly overtaken due to the repetitions in the story before.In conclusion, I believe that it is a movie that will worth your time. I think it could have been better, but I had a great time while I was watching it. In my opinion, it was gripping even though after the things that I have just said.

227,jonn-en,The movie is a joke,4,24 January 2021,"The plot summary of the movie says, 'The epic journey of a poor Indian driver who must use his wit and cunning to break free from servitude to his rich masters and rise to the top of the heap.'. Seriously, killing his employer and taking his name does not make him smart or cunning, throughout the movie all he's doing is slaving, and is a victim until the moment where he kills his employer, that too happens at the very end of the movie. And they want us to believe he gets away just by bribing a police officer at a station, as if there's nobody else in the police force who might be looking for a suspect who has committed murder, especially of someone who has political connections. I cant believe how can this be an epic journey.I have not read the book so cant comment on the original story, but if its the same story then the plot summary of the movie is incorrect. The story is the story of many Indians who come from rural India and are part of the feudal system that exists there. But it is by no means story of someone with wit or cunning and is not a foolproof way to get rich.Also scenes where he writes to and then meets the Chinese premier was a bit unrealistic.

229,joshuarenealvarez,The White Tiger (2021),8,11 February 2021,"The White Tiger is a drama film written and directed
by Ramin Bahrani and it's an adaptation of Aravind Adiga's 2008 best-selling novel of the same name. The storyline follows Balram Halwai (portrayed by Adarsh Gourav)
who delivers a solid performance in his first leading role
as a young man whom has known poverty his entire life
and seeks to climb the social ladder. But this proves to be near-impossible as there are only two prevalent caste-systems amongst that society. Balram expresses throughout this film that only the upper class are allowed better opportunities and those in the lower class must accept their stations (permanently). To live a fruitful life,
he aspires to become the chauffeur for the son of the village landlord, who has returned from the United States with his wife. This brings us to the introduction of the characters of Ashok and Pinky (portrayed by Rajkummar Rao and Priyanka Chopra) who provide very good supporting performances as an idealistic couple.Their relationship with Balram is one of the best aspects
of this film as they view him as a human being with
goals and aspirations rather than a slave.This is a rags-to-riches story which is pretty entertaining for the most part. The cinematography by Paolo Carnera
was wonderful to feast your eyes on and the social commentary on the day-to-day life of the lower
class in India makes the viewer become mindful
and sympathetic towards those who struggle.Unfortunately, what I did find lacking in the film was the emotional resonance as the characters didn't have much depth to them. I realized that the narrative-style of storytelling within this film takes away from Gourav's performance rather than contributes to it. The script isn't particularly original and it's predictable to a degree. The film's ending is morally questionable and I can see
it being dissatisfying for some but all in all,
this was an engrossing film.Follow me on Instagram: @joshuarenealvarez

But it is highly highly unlikely that someone who was born poor will become rich. On the other hand, some people are born in rich and privileged families. That is one of the biggest things that makes this world unfair.The White Tiger plays in India where the importance of the family you are born in is more obvious, but the principles are the same here: Either you have a rich family or you have to struggle a lot and must have good luck to become rich. So the american dream is not impossible, but improbable. I hope people stop voting for conservative parties and start voting for social parties that make this planet a more fair place.(English is not my native language)",The White Tiger

Waste of time,1,16 April 2021,"At first look of plot line, it seems that it will be a movie about inspiration and how a common man rises to the top but reality is so much disappointing. All through the movie I was wondering where is the cunning and wit mentioned in plot line and how and when the protagonist will come out of this so called cage he keeps repeating. After wasting about 90% of the time watching the same gutless acts, master-slave relationship, it comes to the same old predictable escape route for the protagonist. What a shame!There was actually no real story to tell. You could have been reading daily newspaper or watching around your circle and find better stories in real life.

(to those who didnt see the trailer, dont watch it!)I really liked the story, i felt a bit of 'parasite' in it but in a more fun, not so deep way. There is tragedy there but not portrayed as strong as the korean movie. and the character arc of Balram was almost a perfect one.Adarsh Gourav as Balram was exceptional, he had that goofy look that made you believe he was that servant but also in the flashforwards you know that he's not all that and he has sides to explore. he was the highlight of the movie.",The White Tiger

As the movie progresses, not only is it visually spectacular, but the character development and story weave together perfectly, resulting in a character driven story full of twists and turns.

This was probably one of the very few times (if not the first) that he got to play the role of a super endowed rich kid and his acting was stilted...almoat as if he was'nt comfortable in his skin playing the role. I was missing Vicky from Stree, Shaurya from Trapped or Newton Kumar!The other drivers who played bit roles were marvellously real-life.Overall a good watch.

The movie successfully conveys the point of the book - that if you're poor you're screwed in India. It's dog eat dog. And it follows the book plot rather well.But I have two quibbles:
1) The second half is more drawn out than necessary. The time between being forced to sign the document and him killing his master could have been easily compressed, but the movie making is so good that I didn't really mind.2) The ending. I suppose the book's ending was deemed too dark for Western audiences and they may be right, so fair enough. It makes me want to read the book again. The writing is excellent.The main actor is tremendously good. His transformation from subservient (but likeable) bootlicker (out of necessity, mind you) to stone cold Alpha male at the end is impressive. I want to see more of him.",The White Tiger

White people and their dellusions on endless economical growth at the expense of environmental collapse, crime and social disparity or the low cast servant who deserves to climb up the latter?

293,jagetiasneha,Punishingly slow and disappointing,3,11 May 2021,"Every book allows its readers to turn it into a collective entity of how it affects every individual differently. Once out in the public domain, it does not belong to its writer alone.When a book is made into a movie, it allows a certain level of artistic and creative freedom but this movie takes the book and turns it into an alien concept. From the language to the background score, all work together to create an ominous foreboding atmosphere from the get go. I don't recall feeling disconnected reading the book but the movie leaves much to be desired.If taken as an individual entity, without comparison to the book, it is a pretty apathetic account of the protagonist. A person who has grown up under the authority of a narcissistic matriarch, salty but never going against her authority for some of the most formative years of his life finding himself at another end of the spectrum is a little hard to digest. Since he isn't given a psychopathic character arc (he is a flourishing member of the society by the end), the character development is severely flawed.For everyone wondering if this is a true depiction of India: IT IS NOT. While it is true that domestic servants in India are easily available, they join any service on their own terms and conditions. The treatment of all domestic help shown in the movie is plain cruel and sickening, trumped up for the sake of theatrics. It is insensitive and offensive coming from a team which is in fact Indian.Cinema is a medium with far reaching consequences on a society and if this movie ends up contributing to normalising domestic violence and abuse as a part of life (which it might, given how impressionable majority of uneducated and educated, rural and urban Indian youth is), it would have set up back by many years as a society.Do not recommend this movie to anyone, and especially to anyone looking to understand Indian culture in all its complexities. This movie is a case of vulgar joke under the guise of everyday India.",The White Tiger

The move is so badly made even a documentary would seem like a rock show.
Cuss words, unnecessary objectification of women. Was this really in the book or someone got paid extra for this false propaganda one would be forced to think.

I get it, the caste system is bad. Ok... so... what're are you going to do about it? The movie says the right thing to do is play the victim. Don't take responsibility and work hard to overcome your barriers. Just be a loser because the only way to get ahead is crime or politics. So nobody smart and hard working can get ahead? And if they do they don't deserve to get ahead? Nobody at all? They're all lucky or connected and corrupt. All 100% of them? Really? The movie doesn't even try to hide the fact that it's pro-communist. The entire plot is the main character writing an e-mail to a Chinese leader! The CCP, the apitame of freedom and goodwill right? So much economic freedom and freedom of speech in China and such a clean environment. Air and water is pristine. That is what China is known for right? LOL. Oh my god. The movie sucks up to China like a desperate goupie. There's more. Apparently the time of the white man is done (as if all white men are the devil) and the time of the brown and yellow man has come. Oh and guess what guys? You're making a movie denouncing a system which you rely on for the success of your film! I'm not saying capitalism is great. But you really want communism? So what exactly? you want to be like China? or you want democratic commnism? Who is going to lead? You? The same corrupt psychopaths that are leading now? Who is going to keep the leaders in line?

And this film as as close to the book as you can get, and I enjoyed it thoroughly, and you will too.There are many Indian reviewers here that hated the move. They complain that it is not realistic, that, for example Balram would not speak such fine English, or that his village would have electricity by now, and so on. First, this is fiction, and we're to accept him as a kind of prodigy. He is not an ordinary child (then man).They complain that the movie presents an old version of India, and that modern India is a high-tech wonderland, without such backwardness anymore. Well, I assure you that many such villages do not have paved roads or electricity. They complain that Delhi is a hyper-modern city, not the place portrayed in the movie. It is a modern city, but huge numbers of villagers (from the ""Darkness"") do live outside, on the edge of the roadway - you merely have to visit there to see it.They complain that rich people don't care whether their servants are Hindu or Muslim, and the film is lying. Oh yea? Since when did this come to pass? Last week?OK, my Indian friends. If you want India to be a center of culture, which it is, then you'll have to grow up and take the good with the bad. If American films were reflective of American society, then all US citizens would want to throw themselves off of a cliff.Finally, many Indian reviewers are angry about a favorite and romantic Bollywood star, Rajkummar Rao, being cast in the role of a ridiculously westernized idiot. Guys, this doesn't mean that Rao is an idiot; he is just playing one, which takes some talent. Moreover, we are seeing things through the eyes of Balram, who views all western-leaning aristos as idiots, ripe for the picking.So forget about the bad reviews and see the movie. It is excellent. And then read the book, which is even better.",The White Tiger

Both these movies jobs aren't to solve your issues like poverty and corruption for you, rather their job is to portray these issues accurately in order to make you think!!The number of people in this review section LYING about this not being the case in India or never having come across such a situation is so funny.

There are discrimination between the rich and the poor but that doesn't mean all rich people are bad. Neither it means that all low class people are horny as shown in the movie.
After watching the entire movie, I didn't understand why Balram was writing letter to the Communist President of China? Why not some fictional President? May be the movie is sponsored by Communist?
The movie insults Hindus. First of all its not 36million gods which Hindus believe, its 33 types of Gods. People who believe in God (especially Buddha) usually don't commit crime. Chinese hate buddhism and thats why they have targeted buddhism in this movie and thats why they have chosen that balram writes letter to Communist Chinese President. So the China, Communist Buddhism Links in this way.
This movie is spreading false information like High-Low Caste, Hindu-Muslim are shown as if every person in India differentiate. Like how India has lot of problems, there are lot of opportunities in India. We have seen people from poor backgrounds changing their destiny.

As of this writing, it's not having any effect, as it's not in Netflix's arbitrary, bogus and biased ""Top 10"". Maybe people don't like to watch movies with Indians, or maybe they don't like Indians in general, as they have been conditioned by the media and others like them to believe that Indians (not being jewish or christian) are somehow evil obstacles hindering their ascension to heaven.As it is, we are inundated with black people on TV commercials, black music in too many movies and TV shows, black this, black that - maybe I'll have to watch shows and movies from 1990 and before to get away from all of this nonsense. This director had a chance, here - use 100 percent Indian music in an Indian movie.Time will tell if the next 1 hour, 25 minutes and 13 seconds of this interesting movie is bereft of that savage, idiotic music.

359,AllenPham,Not your everyday rags-to-riches story,9,18 February 2021,"Balram (Adarsh Gourav), an Indian servant from a poor village, awareness and self-belief helps him break free from his past and inevitable future to become the entrepreneur success story showcasing what happens when willingness meets opportunities. Balram's chance comes as he plots himself into being the Stork's new chauffeur (his village landlord), where he caters to his new master the Stork's youngest son Ashok (Rajkummar Rao) and his westernized wife Pinky (Priyank Chopra).""The White Tiger"" was an enjoyable and thrilling rags-to-riches story set place in India. The social commentary and clash of western vs eastern world might have been packaged too neatly with easy-to-follow themes. But, the guided path made the movie familiar and challenged the viewer's own perspective.The rarest of animals -- the creature that comes along only once in a generation -- the White Tiger.The White Tiger is a sympathetic, once in a generation, success story of rags-to-riches. That against all social odds in India, a self-believed person, through willpower can have choices once escaped from his cage that he inherited. Balram's awareness of the caste system and his trapping ""in a perpetual state of servitude, like a chicken in a Chicken Coop"" becomes more apparent as Ashok and Pinky tease and flaunt the opened door only to slam it shut later on. As Balram's inescapable, foreseeing future in the Coop led him to a dead end. Through his breaking point and willingness to sacrifice his past and his family, he summoned up the courage to break free from the Coop to become the White Tiger.India is two countries in one: an India of Light, and an India of Darkness. Man born in the Light have the choice to be good. Man born Darkness don't have that choice.
The movie simplified the discussion of social class, wealth, poverty, and the moral choices we might have. The social commentary brings up moral choices you might or might not have when you're born in the Light, or in Balram's case the Darkness. Like any social issues, it shows the complexity of the grey area. The movie reminds us nothing is absolute, like black or white, or in Light or in Dark. Ashok and his family, born in the Light, have choices to be good or bad, and most times they seem to choose the latter when convenient. Pinky's dilemma left her to decide to stay in the Light by choosing the Darkness, and leaving Balram's with the only option of staying in the Dark. But through his darkest deed, the Light shined on him. In the Light, he was a person with choices that led to his rise to success and moral righteousness.Neither you nor I speak English, but there are some things that can be said only in English.Personally, with not not much knowledge about the Indian culture the movie did a phenomenal job of making it more relatable through the guiding and outspoken personality of Pinky and Ashok with their westerned influences and values. Through them, my perspective was heard and seen on screen. As I clashed with the culture and brought up questions of differences, they asked those questions for me. I was a character in the room and not just a fly on the wall.But, the constant hand-holding left me little to explore on my own. I was led directly down a path for the Westerners. From the ever-present western ideologies of Pinky and Ashok, Balram English narration, or the direct discussion of the brown, yellow, vs white man -- the westerner world was everywhere.Conclusion, any enjoyable movie's highest compliment -- I didn't want the movie to end.",The White Tiger

379,black-eyed-angel,Breaking out of the coop,7,23 February 2021,"Everybody loves a rags-to-riches story where the underdog triumphs through grit, determination and maybe a little luck. When that isn't enough it might require being 'sly and sincere, all at the same time' so explains the protagonist of Ramin Bahrani's 'The White Tiger.' Balram is immaculately groomed, sharply dressed and sitting at a desk in a lavish office. How did he ascend from India's lower castes to wealthy businessman?With narration and flashbacks, Balram's struggles start from an early age as an exceptionally bright yet impoverished village boy. His teacher anoints him as a 'white tiger' that appears once in a lifetime: a life with the potential to escape the cycle of poverty. But as misfortune would have it, Balram watches his ill father go to an early grave and is forced to spend his days crushing coal to support his family.Determined to improve his lot in life Balram grows up and finds work as a chauffeur in Bangalore for a rich family. He ingratiates himself with his employers and forms a bond with their son, Ashok, a would-be entrepreneur with grand visions for India's future. Well, it's a tenuous bond given their respective positions on the social economic ladder. It's not long before Balram sees his employers' true colours: how they accumulate their wealth, how they maintain their privilege and keep the underclass trapped in perpetual poverty.Iranian-American Bahrani appeared more than a decade ago as a director of indie films 'Chop Shop' and 'Goodbye Solo', movies about immigrants and the underprivileged. They were well received by critics but apparently not a lot of people saw them. Here Bahrani juxtaposes the confronting slums with the glittering towers with some restraint. He along with cinematographer Paola Carnera highlight the stark disparity by showing Ashok's spacious condo bathed in a golden flood of sunlight. In contrast, Balram's bug-infested accommodation seems almost subterranean, with faces lit by a ghostly fluorescent sheen.In the first part of the film Balram remains a passive observer. The movie is slow to kick into gear but after a jarring turning point, Balram is reminded of his lower caste roots and that only by being quick-witted and ruthless will he survive. Adarsh Gourav's performance as Balram has earned him praise and rightly so. As the film draws closer to its end, the audience may suspect what may follow. The ending might even be seen as somewhat anti-climactic but gives plenty to think about. This tale of poor boy makes good is a darkly scathing jab at capitalism, political corruption, the caste system and the hypocrisy of the rich.",The White Tiger

The book won numerous literary awards and for good reason. The book is a social commentary on the caste system and the difference between the rich people and poor people. How the low caste people aren't even allowed to have dreams other than that of having a good master.
The movie also follows the same lines, infact, it doesn't deviate much from the book at all. The movie is good but I think it could have been better from a directing standpoint. The acting was fabulous and Adarsh Gourav as Balram Halwai shines.
I'd say the book gives a much better and deeper understanding on the subject but nonetheless the movie is definitely worth a watch.",The White Tiger
385,preranasharmascriet,Better than the book..!,8,23 January 2021,"Adarsh Gourav is so convincing as balram that I can't imagine he is acting. The movie is fast paced, edgy and has the right elements coming in together. Shows the extremes poverty can drive one to and depicts the rich poor divide in India somewhat accurately. I believe the non Indian audiences will anyway love as they usually love the ""hungry India poor India"" narrative(slumdog, lion) but its an equally good watch for Indian audience as it gives a window into minds of a strata of society, most of the upper and middle class doesn't bother to care about.

I wish the makers realised that not only will the old propaganda about the caste system will no longer work but also indians are now more sophisticated than to fall for the same old Hindu Muslim saga. Too many touch points to try and stir hatred hopefully failed. The ""messge"" of this movie is to kill if you are poor and call it entrepreneurial. The whole movie speaks of nothing but the ignorance of the makers.. the lead apparently has never heard of Facebook (LOLLL- do you know where fb's highest membership nos. Come from? And yes this includes people in the ""slums""), reliance on so much and such extremes of abusive language and scenes that speak of the desperation of the makers to get attention, the lead actress apparently isn't taken seriously by her wealthy in laws due to being a girl yet they are fully aware and in awe of the female minister that calls the shots.

It shows the true raw dichotomy that we live in- and from the eyes of the 90+%. People always say if I can do it, then you can too. This movie literally debunks that ideology- in the sense of not everyone is giving the same opportunities. I see people disliking it because it addresses caste and mentions religion. I say focus on the bigger picture. This is happening all over the world. Let this be your window. Let this become a conversation starter.",The White Tiger
392,varunathapar,Fantastic. Gripping!,10,23 January 2021,"What a fantastic film!At its most obvious level, The White Tiger is essentially about the complexities of the Indian social structure, and the shadow of the caste system that still permeates through our collective subconscious. But as an Indian I can't separate my own personal experience of the society that I live in from the story on the screen, not least because I can't shake off the idea that Balram would certainly classify me as one of the ""big-bellied"" caste whom he despises, envies but also desperately wants to be a part of.I think the power of the story lies in its inherent paradox. Since the story is told from the perspective of Balram the driver, I was naturally drawn towards rooting for the protagonist with his bad teeth and annoying hairstyle, for him to ""break out of the coop"", and ""leave the darkness and enter the light"". But then he is equally the antihero who all the big bellied people should be afraid of. In the final climax, there's sad irony and perhaps also a bit of dark humor in the realization that it's precisely the exposure and the opportunities that Balram's master provide him that sow the seeds of his masters ultimate (very literal) demise. There is seemingly no way out of this paradox, no rainbows to mark an ending where everyone lives happily ever after.A standout feature for me in the film was the powerful acting that gave an honest and very real human colour to the problematic issues that the film is dealing with. And without a doubt, I would say that Adarsh Gourav deserves accolades for his performance because he makes the character of Balram ever so real. His prying eyes stealing furtive glances of Ashok and Pinky making out in the back of the car, his anger at being pestered by an old beggar lady contrasted shortly thereafter by the generosity he displays to a beggar child, and the sense of shock and betrayal when he's asked to sign the false confession statement, which he expresses so subtly through moistened eyes and a smile; eyes that so perfectly communicate the realization of the injustice being meted out to him and the accompanying sense of inner rage.In the end, the film left me in binds, emotionally unresolved and thinking for hours after about what I had seen and what it all means to me (and for me) in a much more intimate sense. Perhaps that's what a great movie does. I could go on but I'll stop here. In short, watch the movie!",The White Tiger

I was scared that a poor movie adaptation would ruin that experience for me.
Anyways, curiosity got the better of me and I watched the movie on the first day. What amazed me was how faithful the movie was to the theme of the book. This is a psychological thriller - so to develop the motivation of the central character might have been easier on book but it was extremely difficult on cinema. No praise is enough for the actor (newcomer) who played Balram Halwai. The whole movie hinged on his performance and he rose up to the task like a champion. Rajkumar Rao has proven himself time and again to be a great actor and he delivers an impactful performance as Ashok Sir. Priyanka Chopra and the other actors all played their parts masterfully.
Next comes the pace of the movie - it was fast paced and exciting as a thriller should be. The earlier events in the film felt a bit rushed but it's obvious you don't have the luxury to spend so much time on unfolding the early events as in a novel. The film focused more on how Balram Halwai turned from a sweet soft spoken humble servant stuck in the coop to becoming free and it absolutely killed it in the process.
It was no simple task to lift the spirit of the novel from the book and put it on cinema but the director has successfully done just that.
I entered into the movie skeptical at first but ended it with the same excitement as I had when I had read the White Tiger book for the first time.

407,ameymahant,Adarsh Gourav roars like a 'white' tiger!!,7,22 January 2021,"*The White Tiger - Review*Based on a Booker-winning novel with the same name by Aravind Adiga, makers didn't had to worry much about the storyline here. Yet Ramin Bahrani, the director, does a commendable job of piecing together 'the other India' on screen, especially after Gully Boy and Slumdog's success. Adarsh Gourav shines the brightest, and that's a big feat, considering the cast that has the likes of Rao, Chopra and Manjrekar in pivotal roles. All actors perform their parts very well, though some depictions could have been better. Cinematography is brilliant, and narration by Gourav exemplary. Short length of the movie is another plus point. Still, the editing could have been crisp as the movie loses pace in the second half, and quite sadly, never gains back the lost momentum. The difference before/after intermission (remember those days?) is so striking, it seems as if there has been a notable gap in shooting both the halves of the flick. Nevertheless, it is watchable for the ""servant-master"" relationship the movie brings to the fore, and with the utter simplicity (not so simple to direct 'simple' after all!) the director brings about the narrative.#MahantWani",The White Tiger

I am surprised that it took them almost a decade to make a film out of this.Absolutely well-made. Adarsh Gourav just proved how amazing of an actor he is! Glad the picturization was done in the context of early 20007 when Pajero Jeeps were a big deal. A sign of upper class who indeed owns the rest.The subtle gestures of two people from the two divided classes making donations to God. One with a coin and the other with a 500 rupee note!

His personality or mentality did not develop over the time during his work with his boss so its hard to be convinced with the story. When he killed his boss in such a horrible way, he planned it well and it was such easy to commit, that contradicts with his religious beliefs and personality. At the end, movie seems to give a wrong message by providing a solution for poor either to kill or to bribe and also Balram was proud of what he did and it shows how he is helping people when he became a rich.",The White Tiger

463,vr-70079,The undertones that can resonate with the international audience,9,25 January 2021,"Excellent screenplay with fantastic performances from all the actors. The best scene in the movie would be the one in which Balram unwillingly signs a confession and holds tears in his eyes while he accepts the fake affection showered on him by his masters. Also the analogy of the 'Rooster in the coop' resonates well with the situation in which the protagonist is duped in. The story is well paced and luckily does not venture into justifying right and wrong. It simply portrays the failure of democracy and capitalism, in faltering the ones in poverty. The false hope of redemption through capitalistic democracy is the new Holocaust haunting the fabric of society.
There are only two negatives namely;
The scene in which Balram kills his master Ashok , did not have the impact and lacked the directorial skills needed to perfect the scene. Also, the introductory piece was unnecessary as the drunk driving by Priyanka gives the viewer the idea that they are going to meet with an accident which would kill someone. The last scene was also rather dragged, unnecessary and could have ended in a crisp note.",The White Tiger

480,viv_s-15604,The Caste System makes me ashamed to be Indian,8,28 February 2021,A really solid film that truly exposes the true face of the Indian Caste System. To be clear I'm second generation British with my parents having been fortunate enough to leave India and move to the UK in the 1960s. You would have hoped that in the 50 years since then that things would have changed but the reality is that the Caste system very much still exists with too many people living a dreadful existence to satisfy the needs of the rich elite. This film beautifully portrays this. The lead character's humility and humbleness really shines a light on this subservient attitude but equally the power and hold over the family members left at home in the village is highlighted. You would hope that shining a light on things might be a driver for change but sadly I doubt it.,The White Tiger

The rest of the movie was a stereotype, and was showing mostly reality, and going that way, it's not very real, that someone would kill their master.They showed correctly like 80% of the things, yes, that's how it is. The poverty, village things, caste-ism, racism, Hindu-muslim stuff, etc. were right on target. It's almost exactly like that.The movie felt like a documentary made for Westerners. It felt rightly so, because the narrator was writing it as a story for Chinese PM, so yes, it was a documentary style. That's what hooked me up.

499,ash-cpo,Once in a lifetime movie,10,1 February 2021,"As an India born person, I can tell you, the movie depicts the people in the shadows, accurately. These are the servants who clean and cook for the affluents, drivers who drive them, and numerous others who were born in lower or poor caste, and decided to come work in the cities for better life. When you hire a car in India, most of the time it comes with a driver. When you sleep in your cozy hotel, very few care to know where the driver sleeps or eats.The movie is about such less fortunate person, Balram Halwai from a poor village in the state of Bihar. Even as a smart kid, he was deprived of education due to a number of circumstances. He landed up working at a local tea shop in the village. He manages to escape the village to work as a driver at a rich muscle man. Balram manages to convince this guy to get a position as the number two driver. Soon he discovers that the number one driver was a Muslim guy, and hid this fact from his master, because he would not have hired him otherwise. Balram throws him under the bus by exposing him to the master, and becomes the number one driver for the family. He repents, but this is all for survival. The muscle man was falling from the good graces of the local politician, so he sends his son to New Delhi to bribe opposition leader. In Delhi, Balram gets closer to his master's son, Ashok and Ashok's wife. He starts believing that they meant well and were good to him, until the things really turn sideways. Ashok's wife (Priyanka Chopra) hits a child while driving intoxicated. Balram is asked to take the fall for this. This starts a series of events, which you should watch without me talking about it.The thing about this movie is that such movies are usually sad and remain sad all the time. This movie, on the other hand remains entertaining for the most part, and engaging all the way to the end.If you liked Slumdog Millionaire, The White Tiger is that but without the Jai Ho song.

We see a raw insight to how the servants are treated and how their mannerisms and habits remain despite making a step up in the world.The scene of Balram brushing his teeth was a very powerful moment. He brushes his teeth aggressively as an attempt to rid himself of the buildup of his past life of living in squalor. The symbolism behind a simple act like brushing your teeth was genius. As much as you brush, you cannot wipe out years of poverty in a single act.Or can you?The ending was a happy one for the protagonist and true to some extent. In a corrupted world, you can backstab, cheat and bribe your way to the top. If the rich can do it, why can't the poor?Ashok and Balram differ in upbringing and riches but in cunning wit and bribery, they're essentially the same.

His conflict between whether to remain loyal or to steal money and flee is also shown elaborately. But the last 15-minutes of the movie turned out to be a disaster; it was as if the makers just wanted to wrap the movie up and get over with it.

524,MrReviewsALot,A film I wanted to like but turns out to have its own agenda and a slew of misinterpretations and exaggerations,5,21 February 2021,"""Do you know about Hanuman, sir? He was the faithful servant of the god Rama, and we worship him in our temples because he is a shining example of how to serve your masters with absolute fidelity, love, and devotion. These are the kinds of gods they have foisted on us Mr. Jiabao. Understand, now, how hard it is for a man to win his freedom in India.""Let me admit first that I really wanted to like this film. It veers so far from mainstream bollywood which is refreshing, but then it goes off the rails in its imbecile interpretation of the caste system and the agonizing experience of the lives of the have-nots in modern India. It's almost infuriating in its lack of nuance. Heck, I'll go so far as to say this belongs to the pulp fiction genre.First off, I'll address the quote above itself as a ""shining example"" of the wild caricatures the film liberally employs and misleads viewers with. In Indian mythology, Hanuman is not a ""servant"". He's a ""devotee"" of Lord Rama. If being a devotee is equivalent to being a servant, well, we need another film to explore that. But I'd assume most of us don't think so (and I'm not very religious myself either) and it seems stupid right off the bat to debase Hanuman as a mere ""servant"" because in India, Hanuman has hundreds, if not thousands, of temples to his name and millions of devotees even to this day. All these devotees are not from the lower caste either. I know a lot of rich businessmen who worship Hanuman as a symbol of simplicity and dedication. In other folklore, he's also represented as the son of the wind god, Vayu. But the writer uses Hanuman as the poster-child of the ""slave mindset"". So, he's simply misinforming most viewers about a prominent Indian god and his mythological origin. Here's the more infuriating part: Any Indian knows that there are plenty of rural gods with their own origin stories and geographies. One village might worship Hanuman, but its surrounding village might worship Kali. Does this mean anything at all? Not really. If you talk to villagers, they'll tell you why a specific God is their mainstay and how their customs developed. So I can tell you for a fact that Hanuman is not some major God for the ""servant caste"". This is utter tripe. There are many other dialogues and shots in the film which perhaps the non-Indians would take at face value but have glaring informational inaccuracies and unrealistic exaggerations with no relationship to reality.As an Indian, it is a shame that we still have many people in a ""servant caste"", whose lives are destined to a dark fate. This is true and there has to be more debate in the 21st century as to why this persists. But this film certainly won't add anything to that debate. If at all, it distorts and divides. The caste system is dissolving but it is slow and as can be seen from reforms and constant political upheaval, it is a painful progress. But as shown in the film, kicking a servant for the heck of superiority? That's downright unthinkable these days. In many families (from my personal experience and conversations with many ""middle-class"" and ""rich"" friends), servants are treated with enough respect EVEN if they're seen as a different caste. And in many rich families, the servant family sometimes lives in a different part of the house itself and they do get all the basic amenities. Oh, and also, they don't religiously wear uniforms. In the film however, the drivers are always living in some ramshackle dungeon like H.G.Wells' Morlocks. Look at that bed Balram sleeps in. His living conditions are purposely designed to create anger but such conditions are exceptions, not the norm.I understand the need to have serious debate about the slave mindset that perpetuates rural India and even slips into urban life occasionally. I understand the need to empathize with the skewed incentives that the have-nots have in this country. I understand this country is far from corruption-free. We have a lot of ground to cover. But if you wanna call India a sham democracy, what can be said of USA with its political drama over the last few years and UK with the Brexit movement? It seems western people have created new demons that threaten their society but they're still ""legit"" democracies? But this film seems to want to single out India for being really backward? I know that when I went to college, none of my peers gave a thought about another's caste when ascertaining whether to be friends with him/her. Honestly. Sure, my experience isn't everyone's. But when I check with people of my parents generation, this wasn't the case. They knew everyone's caste alongwith their names. They could even tell the caste of the person sometimes by the name itself. But most of my generation doesn't even know where to begin with making such classifications. If this isn't progress, what is? And if this is progress, how does this film make our understanding any better?Broad-stroke statements about a multi-cultural billion-peopled country like India, in this day and age, is just contributing to the general misinformation and two-bit conversations prevailing in the age of the Internet. I wish this film had more nuance. Instead, it chooses the easier way of simply mocking India's state of affairs and making a caricature of how Indians live with the caste system. This is not the modern India that most of us actually living here can see. Take this fact. My watchman has a cellphone that he watches movies on and his kid uses it for her school projects. The kid even watches educational videos on the Youtube app. Why does Balram not own a damn cellphone? Why doesn't he text or call anyone? Why doesn't he get any form of entertainment whatsoever? ""The character is in the early 2000's or so, so ofcourse he couldn't afford a touch-screen phone"", you might say. But my opinion is that the writer just cut a corner to suit his agenda. But it's a big corner to cut. The biggest disparity that existed between developed and developing nations, between various classes of society, was one of information. But with cheap mobile phones (a 5.5inch phone now costs under $100 here) and cheap data (India has the cheapest in the world), that gap is closing down rapidly. But hey, let's leave this century's biggest zeitgeist and its implications out and focus only on the grimy stuff, right?All the actors did justice to their roles, especially the supporting cast. Rajkumar is a pathetic rich man who doesn't recognise his privileges. Adarsh is a fiery, entreprenerial man who struggles to understand and untangle himself from the web of the caste system. Priyanka Chopra is a naive liberal-""sounding"" NRI woman (there's probably a jibe because she's a chiropractor, you decide) but who also just turns out to be a terrible human being and chooses to escape her wrongdoing because she simply can.To his credit, Ramin Bahrani made better films. This is certainly not an indictment of his prowess. I watched ""Chop Shop"" and ""Man Push Cart"" and they're just brilliant. They're so hard-hitting and real that you have to seriously ask yourself whether one lives their life ignoring the dark underbelly of society or just lives inside one and never knows it. This is not such a film. It has the same theme, sure, of the dark corners of society and the people struggling in them. But the hard-hitting realistic characters are not there. The nuance is not there. Making caricatures and simplistic interpretations is why modern Indians are distrustful and disapproving of Bollywood. So, in a way, this film is very Bollywood.The review wouldn't have been this long if it was just ""an entertaining story"". But the film does offer social commentary and hence lends itself to dissection and critical analysis. If you slogged through this review, please distance yourself from this film. It's in the realm of sensationalist/misinformation than educational/insightful. So, I won't even recommend it as a one-time watch.Disclosure: I haven't read the book. Some say it is better. I hope it is, for the sake of its readers.P.S.: Alas, one can say ""The narrator is Balram. The picture should be seen in his perspective, not the writer or director"". I'm open to that interpretation but my personal opinion is ""No"". The film went so far to show some scenes and write dialogue that I definitely think they held some agenda or strong viewpoints. So, in my opinion, the writer and director can't really distance themselves from a creative standpoint. Anyways, that's for each viewer to decide on their own.",The White Tiger

Adarsh Gaurav as a debutant makes his mark & that's why OTT platform are best for begginers as they're getting the opportunity to show their talent. Supporting cast is good too.

Leaving that aside and coming to the main topic of the movie - Even if the driver was forced to sign a false confession and you feel sad for his plight, it does not justify the character to promote evil values like lying, stealing from his employer and ultimately murdering him. Now this employer 'Ashok' was actually the good character unlike evil characters like his brother or father. Showing that the protagonist becoming a successful businessman by committing murder, giving large sums of bribe to the police and callously ignoring the fact that his family of 17 got murdered by evil characters as revenge for his actions is simply promoting wrong values. Your emotions and sad past cannot be used as an excuse for you to commit
murder and steal and these values should not be promoted among people by such movies. Do the movie makers actually want an India with such people? The story is flawed and I wouldn't recommend the movie.",The White Tiger

533,richardcorbally,Darkness and the light,7,28 January 2021,"While many movies focus only on the happy or sad aspects of a country or life, The White Tiger is a good example of how India as a country works. Although many of its citizens are extremely poor, life is not complete misery. However it shows the massive corruption within its elected bodies and the impossible nature of properly policing over a billion people. This leads to a higher-archaical structure that encourages people to put themselves first and break the law in order to get ahead. It takes a deeply pessimistic view of democracy and is borderline an advert for authoritarian rulership of the country. All that being said I do not mind seeing different perspectives of what life is like and it is a overall a smart and enjoyable film.",The White Tiger

Then after a disappointing climax that didn't really pay off anything that was set up earlier, the protagonist kills his master (and not even the annoying one) and runs off with a load of money. There is a much more interesting story to tell her, but unfortunately the filmmakers aren't interested in showing that. The saving grace of this movie is some really solid performances, cool cinematography, and some a pretty sweet soundtrack. Personally however, I would recommend picking something else to watch.

But still the people under them suffers for those moments.The one quote that strikes me in the movie is "" Rich men are born with opportunities they can waste, But a poor man?""

I heard Steve Inskeep talk to the director on NPR's Morning Edition program and I was very eager to watch the movie on Netflix later that day. I thought that this was going to be like Alfonso Cuaron's award winning Roma which I watched it on the first day when it was released. However, White Tiger was just a mish mash of poor dialogue, subpar acting from all and unnecessary bad language. It showed like a bullet list of negative things about India that someone living outside India wanted to let it out in this movie (they could have just used PowerPoint slides).

But I ve to write this as I ve a bit of social responsibility and I can visualize the impact it could have on many Indian and thrid world country youngsters. We ve seen many Rags to Riches stories while this is the most stupid Rags to Riches story. The only character that made sense was Priyanka Chopra. If killing and bribing is the only way to become rich, any stupid guy can become one.
Film talks about having a choice as Priyanka mentions that the door is always open, when she leaves. Movie viewers should all stop watching and leave with that scene. Cos after that, in the name of depicting reality, it justifies seeking an easy way out of poverty by committing Crime.
Atleast in this millennia, though there are both positives and negatives in the society, yet there are options for Indians to seek a better path. I know and have seen hundreds of below poverty people who came out of so called Coop by sheer hardwork, hustle and wit. And there are millions of people still living this conditions who can get wrongly influenced and start picking up weapons for their anxiety disorders. Directors and Netflix should understand that they should not make movies that has such bad influence which says it s ok to commit a crime(whatever stupid justification you can cook up) as India is already suffering from extreme crimes and corruption. It is your duty to influence for a better blissful tomorrow not to milk viewership by misguiding the youth with dark content just because it sells more. India strongly believes in Karma and that s what is keeping the country a bit safe where it is now, despite many broken systems, don't spoil it.

622,tsy94,Food for thought for the nerds🤓,7,17 April 2021,"First of all the acting and the production are amazing. Adarsh Gaurav (Balram Halwaij) was literally the star of the show. Even though the backdrop is India, I don't think it is specifically about the Indian social hierarchy or the caste system. The protagonist Balram Halwai manages to become a chauffeur for the wealthy Ashok (Rajkummar Rao)- the youngest son of the landlord of his village. He is initially Starstruck and seems to be trapped in a perpetual sense of servitude. The story takes a dark turn when the very people that he reveres coerce him into giving a false confession to get out of a murder charge. The feeling of entrapment and a series of betrayals motivate him to kill Ashok. He moves to Bangalore- the silicon valley of India and starts a new business with the money that stole from his employers.What is unique about the storyline is the progression of the character Balram Halwai- how the guileless rural Indian eventually lifts himself from the poverty pit by stealing money from his murdered employer and bribing the police. The most symbolic moment of the movie for me was when Balram reveals that he changed his name to Ashok (his employer) when he took on his new identity.I think the storyline points out a not-so-obvious flaw in the eat the rich sentiment. Unless you belong to the lowest stratum in society you are part of the problem to some people. What happens when they come after You? Also, when you do eat the rich and climb up the proverbial social ladder are you certain you won't succumb to the same moral corruption? Is it the people or the system that is corrupt? It is important to note that the metric of success was exactly the same for both Ashok and Balram. His story is worth telling because he managed to become a successful entrepreneur, what Ashok always wanted to be. As long as we base our
value primarily on materialistic achievement, will every successful revolt against the rich merely result in a change of players and not a change in the game?What I didn't like about this movie: the last one-third clearly fell flat compared to the first part. It seemed hastened and not as well produced. Also, I feel like Balram got away with his crimes much too easily. I am guessing the problem might be with the adaptation and not the actual storyline (I haven't read the book yet).This is the kind of movie that you and your friends can analyze for months and never come to an agreement. If you love open-ended narratives, this is a must-watch.",The White Tiger
623,Jadexe,"Acting was great, but the story? Not so much",6,16 February 2021,"The main character killed it. The acting was phenomenal. The story however not so much. When you think about your family several times, and the consequences of your actions can put them in danger.. WHY murder your master??? It just doesn't make sense. Was making money that important? He knew they would ho after his family and he did it anyways. And what did we actually learn by watching this movie? That bribing and murder is THE thing to do when you have the ambition to get rich. The only thing it taught me was that money hungry people change. The main character had a pure innocent soul. But because of the way he was threated he became someone else. It's still not an excuse to murder someone, steel and to bribe.",The White Tiger
624,varmasoumya,Good film with good acting,7,25 February 2021,"This movie has a good plot. The acting is definitely the best part about it.

625,Nadved_Yed,Unmasking Hegemony Of The Ruling Class Ideology,7,16 March 2021,"This Cinema peeps into Balram's desires that manifest into ""rags-to-riches"" fantasy which acts as guiding force for his conducts to move to higher stratum. In another way- fantasy blurs intricate complexities of capitalist ideology, provides an easy solution, by which lower-class came into a conjugal relationship with dominant ideology.In his fantasy world is a jungle where people in each level imprisoned in rooster-coops.Now, more important question than what rooster-coop signifies is why they don't rebel, knowing their terrible fate.In the first stage Balram literally, ""can read this but doesn't get what he read"". Observe, by gaining ""episteme"" he is ascending from one stage to another in food-chain hierarchy.When he himself gets trapped to this deadlock of voracious ideology, circling within the labyrinth of skyscrapers, suddenly the harder truth smacked, that the ""family""-as institution- is ""ideological state apparatus"", only serves the purpose of ruling class. To get rid of this institution(s), only
""replacement"" by killing others wouldn't work, rather one has to kill that part of oneself which shackles one to masters' orders.He ought to kill himself(here by abandoning his birth-name) to reincarnate as WHITE TIGER.",The White Tiger

Things have drastically improved over the last two decades and good proportion of population is living reasonably well. The way India was projected is so outdated, I agree caste system and corruption are two major issues but everything else is just rubbish, trying to sell it on the back of a young man trying to break free.

Balram didn't know what he would become in the city. He had just a humble dream to become a driver of a rich family. He wanted to be a loyal servant to the family, and masters seemed good people until they reveal their true inside of themselves. Master couple, educated in USA, had sympathy for Balram, but they turn their back when critical moment happened. That, in my thoughts, represents their nature of that class or caste, and a natural human being who most of time hold tight on to what they have.

I know India has huge issues with poverty and class systems, but is this really how it is? I'm not complaining. But I also don't want to pigeon-hole the country based on this movies portrayal.It's a harsh film highlighting the desperate plight of just one man among the MILLIONS of poor and starving in India and his desire to ascend... no matter the cost.The film followed the path of the book almost flawlessly.The story of Balram is definitley rags to riches. But it is certainly not ""feel good"" or glamorous. India is portrayed as a brutal country and if you are not wealthy or politically wired, you're existance is simply reduced to a waiting game with death as the end result.To sum it up in one phrase, this movie could be tagged; ""Dog eat dog."" Other reviewers expressed their disgust at the protagonists methods for success. But I also bet they've never been poor, let alone poor in India.You can discuss ethics and morality from the comfort of your lounge room/home theatre all you want.

I mean seriously there are thousands of examples of people in India belonging to poor family end up successful in their lives by their hard work, commitment to achieve success in their life, by mastering in their skills, by inventing ideas which are useful for humankind, by following their passion But, our director sees only two ways to exit from the cage of poverty as I have mentioned above.Irrespective of the illogical concept, the acting of the lead actor Adarsh Gourav (Balram Halwai) was outstanding.

641,jagmodi,Repackaged Slumdog Millionaire,1,6 February 2021,The story is typical where a boy from village in northern india chooses crime to succced. Apart from Main character played by Adarsh Gourav rest all cast in lead roles including PC and Rajkumar Rao are diasspointing. Unecessary annoying fake accents and a story line that seems was written 20 or 30years before current times.I have read this book by arvind adiga and the book was nothing like this.It seems they just wanted to get some publicity for the movie thats why they used the books title.,The White Tiger
642,shiv_leon,Worthless!,2,5 February 2021,The story leads nowhere! Futile attempt to malign the image of India. There are a few cases of caste racism still but this movie tries to stereotype and show it in extreme. There are many servant master relationships in the country's which are very amicable and having communal caste based harmonious relationships..apart from this also I didn't find any sense in the movie..message seems to be lost..entertainment is average..,The White Tiger
643,shaheerjavaid,Spoiler Warning,5,26 September 2021,"Ending is so weak as compare to the hole story. Some story plot might need to be changed according to my narrative.There is no such logical reason to be showed Ashok family deep relations with political leaders, Just showed them as rich cruel landlord is enough.Don't need to be showed Grandmother as a negative character because this thing don't effect story even with positive portrayed character shows a strong bond within the family.At the accident time, there was no need to showed that Balram stop the ashok to see the child. Reserve scenario could be more better if Balram tried to reach the child and ashok stop him to do that.Ashok drive while hitting the child, make story more sense. Because with this reason ashok family tried to save him and take balram confession with threat and influence, and due to this pinky left him. Ashok start drinking due to that incident.Ashok do what his father and brother said because he knows he did a murder and his point of view would also be changed gradually due to feel the power of being rich in this third world country.",The White Tiger

649,smithalan2,Decent watch,7,30 January 2021,"I don't usually write reviews but I thought I would for this as I was debating weather or not to watch it. Its very hard to figure out from reviews if an Indian film is good or not, as they always seem to have high ratings, so in general I find reviews can't be trusted for Indian films. Here's my brief take on The White Tiger.The first half of the film is good, it's interesting and the story keeps you interested, the 2nd half is okay, some parts didn't make sense to me, and the ending was sped through.This film is worth a watch overall I think, the acting pretty good and it definately feels more like 'hollywood' than 'bollywood'",The White Tiger

Doesn't mean that I haven't watched any movies, but movies like these really pushed me to speak my heart out. Some filmmakers believe in making money just by showing the darker side of the society( ex: slum dog millionaire).This movie is a joke on the people who believe that hard working and loyalty is a good thing. This might definitely please few western audience, but might be really hurt from an Indian who believe that his country in changing.

The dialogues come fast and furious with some great quotes. Adarsh Gourav (Balram) is brilliant.,The White Tiger
678,crashtextr,Too Raw Too Realistic,10,17 September 2021,"MOVIE REVIEW ~ The White Tiger (Netflix)Based on the book by the same name written by Aravind Adiga, this movie is about the rise of an ambitious man from the pits of poverty to becoming a successful entrepreneur albeit with a twist. This movie starts from a small village in Bihar where the main protagonist Adarsh Gourav is born to a poor man who toils day and night to make ends meet. Adarsh named Balram Halwai in the movie is a bright kid who successfully reads proper English sentences in a village school where government schools are known for its sub-standard education. The school inspection officer is impressed by Balram and offers him scholarship in a city school. But things take a turn for the worse for Balram as his father is debt ridden and Balram has to toil in someone's shop breaking coal with hammer to pay off his father's dues. Balram doesn't get to see the face of school after this day. Things get even worse with his father dying of tuberculosis soon and the task of running the family falls on him and his elder brother. The journey of bondage starts for Balram henceforth. He starts working in a shop doing odd jobs but always had a passion for making it big in life. He sees his opportunity in the younger son of Mahesh Manjrekar acted by Rajkumar Rao(RR) who has just returned from USA. Mahesh Manjrekar and his elder son are coal mafia dons who are also into ""hafta vasuli"" from poor villagers. Balram overhears that the family requires another driver and borrows Rs.300 from his grand-mom to learn driving and finally lands as the personal driver of RR.Things change drastically for Balram after he takes up this job. I won't go into the plot of the movie any further and would leave the rest of the content to be viewed by the audience. I had very little to no expectation from the movie when I watched the trailer of the movie back in January of this year. But I was blown away by the plot of the movie when I watched it last night. One big reason for the movie to be this good is because it is based on a novel. Books/novels give you great script to work upon. The narrative style is similar to the movie The Life of Pi which too was based on a novel. There is a constant voiceover narrating what's going on in the protagonist's head similar to The Life of Pi. Priyanka Chopra has a small but substantial role in the movie. The acting of the rest of the cast is great including Rajkumar Rao but the protagonist played by Adarsh Gourav is exceptional.It's a movie of Rich verses the Poor. How the rich manipulate and subvert the poor and how one odd person who refuses to accept the protocol rises up and fights for his ambition. The thing to appreciate about this movie apart from acting is its cinematography. You get a very hard hitting reality of India where people on the roadside slums and people inside air-conditioned cars are juxtaposed. The movie is very raw in its treatment of poor people and situations. I was surprised by the human psychology shown in the movie especially of the protagonist. He goes through a lot and grows through it too. I would highly recommend this movie to everyone who hasn't watched it yet.",The White Tiger
679,austinruse,Awful Movie About Awful People,2,24 January 2021,"I was waiting for some kind of heartwarming payoff after a few hours of torture of an innocent man by amoral people.

680,kavyibox,A poor adaptation of a brilliant novel,6,15 May 2021,I wonder why this movie got an Oscar nomination under the Best Adaptated Screenplay category (!). Except for the lead actor Adarsh no one and nothing matched up to the characterization offered by Aravind Adiga in his book. The entire movie was incoherent and had a lot of characteristic events eschewed out that could have helped with the solid characterization in the movie that went missing.I believe it's Oscar nomination under the best adaptation category was purely because of the influence the movie had because there are other brilliant movies that are way more deserving and also because it definitely is not the standard for Oscars either.The rating of six is also only for the performance of the lead actor Adarsh.,The White Tiger
