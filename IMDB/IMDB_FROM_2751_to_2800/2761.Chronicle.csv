0,Leofwine_draca,Superhero story with a difference,6,22 June 2012,"I'll admit to having a soft spot for found footage horror films and shot-on-camcorder outings; I find them inventive and a breath of fresh air when compared to the latest x million budget Hollywood blockbuster. There's something raw and down to earth about making movies on a seeming shoestring, something that gets back to the heart of what filmmaking is all about in the first place.I'd seen the trailer for CHRONICLE and I'll admit that it impressed me, intriguing it with its potential storyline of ordinary American teenagers discovering extraordinary powers. In essence, this takes the same type of ideas as many of the superhero films floating around cinema screens at the moment and presents them in a far more realistic way, showing the effect of ultimate power on ordinary minds.The film that follows is something of a mixed story. It starts out realistic but soon goes into some pretty offbeat places before it finishes up being precisely the type of OTT piece of spectacle that I was hoping it wouldn't turn out to be; when they drop the whole shot-on-camera look in favour of a cinematic style, the impact is lessened. The biggest problem, though, is the entire lack of a sympathetic character. The lead in particular is a whiny, maladjusted youth who I couldn't stand, and his supposed friends are little better.There are still reasons to watch, not least the unorthodox approach to the material and some quite spectacular special effects work, but the film never reaches the heights it had the potential to reach. There's just way too much of the larking about/look at me stuff when it should have stuck with the serious, more realistic angle.",Chronicle
1,SnoopyStyle,"Nice little movie, done in indie style, but with credible F/X",7,1 September 2013,"Whilst attending a party, three high school friends (Dane DeHaan, Alex Russell, and Michael B. Jordan) gain superpowers after stumbling upon an incredible underground artifact. They have pretty good chemistry together, and seem like regular bros I know.It's a simple premise. There isn't much to it. They have some fun with their newfound powers, but power corrupts. There is a lot of these lesser movies that have good CGI these days. It's done with a lot of first person hand held POV. This one is a fairly simple story, but it's done well. The final battle isn't quite as compelling. It feels repetitive after the numerous guys-thrown-through-a-building scene. The filmmakers just got a little carried away. It would probably work better with a slimmed down climax.",Chronicle
2,Prismark10,Fury in the footage,5,18 February 2015,"Chronicle is a found footage film although by the end of the film you might be wondering who was taking the footage by that point.The film was co-written by Max Landis (son of John Landis) It follows three Seattle high school students. Andrew (Dane DeHaan) is socially awkward, bullied and always armed with a camcorder, his cousin Matt (Alex Russell) and more popular Steve (Michael B Jordan.)The trio form a bond after gaining telekinetic abilities from an unknown rock. They first use their abilities for mischief and personal gain. They realise that they need to form rules as to how to use their powers but Andrew whose powers are strongest becomes increasingly unstable.The film has elements of the film Carrie as the geek turns on the people who are oppressing him including his father. The film begins with the superhero origins scenario as the group realise that with great powers come great responsibility which is subverted by Andrew whose inner demons are coming out in the open. However you see it all coming as the trio begin to conflict with each other leading to an epic super battle at the end.You then realise that the film has nothing much to offer and went through all the normal plot points in a predictable fashion.",Chronicle
3,claudio_carvalho,You Are not a Bad Person?,6,29 June 2013,"The shy, lonely and outcast teenager Andrew Detmer (Dane DeHaan)is bullied and has no friends at high-school and lives with his abusive and alcoholic father Richard Detmer (Michael Kelly) and his terminal mother Karen (Bo Petersen). Matt buys a camera to film his everyday.His cousin Matt Garetty (Alex Russell) drives him to school and invites Andrew to go to a party at night. They meet their schoolmate Steve Montgomery (Michael B. Jordan) in the party and they overhear a noise and find a hole in a field. They decide to explore the underground and they acquire powers. Soon the trio learns how to control their telekinetic abilities and Andrew becomes the most powerful. But he easily loses his temper and becomes dangerous while Matt tries to control him. When his mother needs a medicine and Andrew does not have enough money to buy it, his darker side overcomes and he becomes a menace.""Chronicle"" is a movie with potential that could have been a great movie, but It is not. The story is a sort of ""Carrie"" with more characters, with three teenagers acquiring telekinetic abilities and one of them abused and timid that is pushed to the limit; awful camera in the style of ""The Blair Witch Project"" and awesome special effects. The three friends are terribly developed - a loser, a pretentious intellectual and a popular guy - but the worst is the ridiculous conclusion. Matt goes to the Tibet and tells to the camera that Andrew is not a bad person. They guy has killed his best friend, several innocent people on the streets and destroyed properties but he is Mr. Nice Guy since he had problems with his father. It is really a great message for the crazies that sometimes commit mass murders. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Poder Sem Limites"" (""Power without Limits"")",Chronicle
4,kosmasp,Superhero found footage,8,2 June 2012,"It's really something people were thinking about. What would you do, if you were in that position? What would really happen with you and your friends? And other questions, that haven't been really answered by other similar themed movies. Of course doing so here, makes this vulnerable to some slower and more boring scenes, that need to be placed in there, to see the progression.Plus for all the trying it does, it is kind of predictable. Does that take anything away from the movies impact? I don't think so. So it is cliché at times (in a common sense world that is), but the actors are doing a great job. Plus it does a neat thing with the found footage thing, that could only be done here and still ""make sense"".Watch it, if you're tired of other movies pretending to know what would happen, but be aware that you might think that the other movies are doing a better job, because they're not trying to depict ""reality""",Chronicle
5,jboothmillard,Chronicle,7,25 November 2014,"I heard a little about this film after it had finished its run in the cinemas, I knew it involved either superheroes or people gaining superpowers, and then I heard about how the film is structured, kind of like Cloverfield, so I was hoping critics mostly positive reviews would prove correct. Basically in Seattle, shy, lonely and outcast teenager Andrew Detmer (Dane DeHaan) has no friends, is bullied at high school student and lives with abusive alcoholic Richard (Michael Kelly) and terminally ill mother Karen (Bo Petersen), and wanting to express his creative side he buys himself an high quality HD video camera to chronicle his everyday life. Andrew's cousin Matt Garetty (Alex Russell) takes him to a party with schoolmate Steve Montgomery (Michael B. Jordan), while there they overhear a loud noise and go to investigate it, they find a large hole in the ground of a field, exploring the underground they find an alien source, and following a blackout they find the next day or two that they have acquired superpowers, including telekinesis, flight and superhuman strength, Andrew captures many of their abilities experiments on camera. Slowly their integrity is tested as they find disagreements with each other and become irresponsible, particularly Andrew who becomes the most powerful of the trio, but unlike them he also becomes easily tempered and dangerous, Steve is killed when struck by lightning while flying in the sky and trying to console him in a moment of frustration. Andrew's mother's incurable cancer worsens and she needs a medicine that he cannot afford, so he uses his powers to steal mother, but he is too late and she dies, and that is when he really snaps and goes into a mad rage of destruction, and Matt, vowing to use his powers for good, is the only one who can stop him, they have a turbulent fight, and in the end Matt has no choice but to kill Andrew, and he flies away in the end with Andrew's camera, leaving it behind in Tibet after one final recording. Also starring Ashley Hinshaw as Casey Letter, Anna Wood as Monica, Joe Vaz as Michael Ernesto and Rudi Malcolm as Wayne. You can argue that this is nothing original, characters gaining superpowers, some turning nasty and the others going against them as the force for good, but the ""found footage"" element from characters' perspectives adds a little twist and makes it a bit more interesting to watch, and of course the special effects and action sequences are impressive and make it flow nicely, overall a watchable science-fiction drama. Very good!",Chronicle
6,Scarecrow-88,Chronicle,9,17 May 2012,"Chronicle just says to me that technology has no limits in where it can go in the filmmaking process. When you look through what seems like a camcorder while above the clouds as a plane nearly decimates three young men with telekinetic powers (thanks to what looks like a large piece of space debris that landed in an open area outside of a club, its impact causing a monstrously long hole) and seems a bit too real, I can only applaud the talents of those who made it possible. I was just staggered, mouth agape, as I watched that chaotic, everything goes berserk, finale in Seattle, as two cousins battle it out as the locals within the city are victims of their out of control powers. Practically the entire experience is shot POV and how they accomplish this feet as the three men fly around like Superman, at first just toying around by making objects float, harmless and playful, gets worse and more dangerous, is a sight to behold. That is because troubled Andrew, a mistreated outcast whose father is a menacing drunk (was a firefighter, an injury on the job forced him into drawing disability) and mother is dying of cancer (her medication costs more than the hubby makes per month) has a lot to deal with on a daily basis. He is the victim of bullying, ignored by most of his classmates, and a virgin the ladies couldn't care less about. He is probably not the most suitable candidate for telekinetic powers, but that is what this movie thrives on emotionally. He is constantly picked on, ridiculed, laughed at, and violently assaulted (the worse abuse comes from pops who is like a volatile stick of dynamite always on the verge of setting off on Andrew). With powers, gaining a fluidity and control that rivals his cousin and high school rock star, Steve Montgomery, Andrew will get revenge on his tormentors. Pulled teeth, hurling bodies through the air, crushing cars just by closing his hand, Andrew is soon comparing himself to the Apex Predator, on top of the food chain and willing to crush those who push him too far. The zenith of this is the ending and the city of Seattle pays the price. Buildings have giant holes, vehicles are tossed to and fro with relative ease, and citizens run for their lives, screaming at high pitch as a force against nature is unleashed with sound and fury that is incredible. Bonafide f/x movie, no doubt, but as an alternative to Big Summer Superhero Blockbuster movies, you can't go wrong with Chronicle. You actually see two of the characters above the clouds during a lightning storm, a car moved from parking place across the pavement and to another area of empty spaces, and POV shots of the camera leaving Andrew's hands, floating around capturing everything while he uses thought to control it. What an experience Chronicle was. I have no idea why I didn't even hear about this movie until it come on DVD/blu-ray. How could such an exhilarating movie as this go so unnoticed?!?! This takes the PG-13 to the razor's edge; it can get quite violent and has some pretty strong scenes (especially between Andrew and his cruel father). You rarely see a film feature super powers, touch on some dark themes, and watch as the wrong people receive them resulting in such death and destruction. It doesn't feel like a superhero movie, as much as a cautionary tale of what could go wrong if someone too fragile and emotionally damaged were to gain powers that can easily lead to terrible consequences.",Chronicle
7,zardoz-13,"A Kind of . . . Sort of . . .""Hancock"" Prequel",8,12 February 2012,"Once upon a time, Hollywood did everything to conceal the presence of the camera. The studios didn't want audiences thinking about the camera poised between their imagination and the screen. Usually, the willing suspension of disbelief dissolves the instant when either the camera crew appears in a reflection or a boom mike dips into the frame. Hollywood has toiled to keep the cinematic process unobtrusive so it doesn't call attention to itself. The first movie that called attention to the camera was the Raymond Chandler murder mystery ""The Lady in the Lake"" (1947) which portrayed everything from the protagonist's point of view. The Humphrey Bogart thriller ""Dark Passage"" (1947) followed several months later, but relied on the gimmick only in its first claustrophobic quarter hour. Everything appeared from the protagonist's perspective. Few films exploited the first-person point-of-view approach until the 1960s. ""Peeping Tom"" (1960) showed a felon who murdered women and used his 16mm Bolex camera to film the event. When the 1970s marched in, the camera played an integral part in the action, especially in the second wave of 3-D movies. Everything came full circle in 1989 with the seldom seen Vietnam War movie ""84 Charlie Mopic."" Everything was shown from the viewpoint of a combat photographer. ""84 Charlie Mopic"" lacked the impact of ""The Blair Witch Project"" (1999) with its iconic first person camera approach. Since then ""Cloverfield"" (2008), ""REC"" (2007), the ""Paranormal Activity"" franchise, and ""The Devil Inside"" have adopted the technique with considerable success. Writer & director Josh Trank and co-scripter Max Landis openly embrace the first person point-of-view approach in ""Chronicle,"" a provocative but formulaic science fiction saga. This contemporary, low-budget, 84-minute, melodrama concerns three teenagers who acquire super powers under strange circumstances. These powers constitute more of a curse for them than a blessing. The narrative blends legitimately with the first person point-of-view approach because the lead character maintains a video diary. He lenses footage of every moment of his life no matter how much it alienates his peers and parents. Basically, he carries a camera with him everywhere. The hand-held, guerrilla-style camera work serves to heighten the reality of ""Chronicle"" and makes its spontaneity appear less theatrical. The cast consists largely of unknown, and this contributes to its pseudo sense of realism.""Chronicle"" concerns the ephemeral, ill-fated friendship that three Seattle high school seniors develop off campus. Andrew Detmer (Dane DeHaan of HBO's ""True Blood"") contends with violence on a daily basis both at home and at school. Drew lives with his dying mother and his abusive, alcoholic father. Drew's mother Karen Detmer (Bo Petersen of ""The Wooden Camera"") suffers from a medical condition that requires her to wear a breathing apparatus. When she isn't in a wheelchair, Karen is confined to her bed. At the same time, Drew's father Richard Detmer (Michael Kelly of ""Law Abiding Citizen"") takes his rage out on his neurotic son because he cannot afford to pay for his wife's expensive medicine. When he isn't taking abuse at home, Drew tangles with bullies at his high school. Little about life is inspirational for Drew. Andrew Detmer is the masculine equivalent of eponymous character in the horror movie ""Carrie."" Every day is a struggle for Drew. By the time he decides to create a documentary about his life, Drew has sown his destiny. Along the way, Drew encounters his philosophical cousin Matt Garetty (Alex Russell of ""Almost Kings"") who furnishes him with transportation to school. Popular African-American student Steve Montgomery is campaigning for school office. Drew encounters Steve at a music rave one night after a jealous boyfriend decks him. Steve persuades Drew to join Matt and him deeper in the woods. They have stumbled upon a mysterious hole in the ground. They need Drew and his camera, equipped with a bright light, to illuminate the hole. Recklessly, the trio plunge into the opening. When the they emerge from the hole, they have been changed. Initially, they use their telekinetic powers for pranks. Eventually, things escalate, and Drew takes advantage of his powers to compensate for his lack of strength and courage.Mind You, ""Chronicle"" isn't a full-blown, costume-clad, super hero adventure in the tradition of ""Superman,"" ""Batman,"" or ""Spider-man."" ""Chronicle"" shares more in common with the Will Smith opus ""Hancock."" These guys don't don latex outfits. Another film ""Chronicle"" resembles in its depiction of people with super powers is Brian De Palma's ""The Fury"" (1978) with Kirk Douglas. In ""The Fury,"" the teenagers used telekinesis to levitate objects without physically touching them. In Chronicle,"" the protagonists exploit their ability to cavort in the clouds, move automobiles without laying a finger on them, and create force fields. Drew surprises his father with his powers when the latter hits him. Just as ""Spider-man"" addressed the consequences of great responsibility, ""Chronicle"" explores the morality of mortals with super powers. Matt argues that they are accountable for their actions. Drew's plight prompts his misuse of his newly attained powers. It is a good thing that we humans were not granted super powers because bad apples exist in every basket to abuse it. The battered hero is a real basket case with a lot in common with the tormented girl in the horror chiller ""Carrie."" Both of them used telekinesis to destroy their enemies. Some inferior special effects, principally, poor rear projection photography, mars the action where we are asked to believe our heroes are actually in high places. Dane DeHaan bears an uncanny resemblance to a young Leonardo DiCaprio and DeHaan's transition from victim to predator is impressive. Ultimately, ""Chronicle"" qualifies as a predictable but nevertheless disturbing thriller that enhances its off-beat plot with its first person camera technique.",Chronicle
8,Boba_Fett1138,"Original, that's for sure.",7,9 February 2012,"No doubt about it, this is one of the most original superhero movies ever made but does it also rank among the best? I don't think so.A found-footage movie, involving a couple of youngster who gain superhero-like powers. That, in one short sentence, is the best way to describe this movie. This premise alone is already a quite original one, that of course gives the movie a more realistic sense to it as well. And this is all very welcome of course. It adds a whole new, other dimension, to both the found-footage and superhero movie genre.Basically it's being a very pleasant, little movie, to watch because it's taking a very straightforward approach with things. There are hardly any side-plots and the movie has a very natural flow to it. Besides, they were being pretty creative at times with the use of the camera(s). You might perhaps worry that it's constantly doing the same thing, with also the same camera-angels time in, time out but the movie found a clever way to use multiple different cameras at times and to make the whole movie also more dynamic to watch.But really, no matter how hard it tries to come across as realistic at times, it just isn't of course. I mean, after all, this is a movie about kids with superpowers. They fly through the air like Superman and smash cars like the Hulk. You could shoot it in a realistic way but it's just never going to look as such, also in this case due to it, that the movie had some pretty poor special effects in it, at certain crucial points, which also took me out of the movie at times.Another thing that just didn't made the movie all that realistic for me was its acting. The kids in this movie just aren't all that great. At times they sound good and very natural but at others it just sounds far too scripted and they obviously didn't had much big acting experience yet.Still the whole approach of this movie and how its story and characters progress and develop in a realistic and very straight-forward way, make this movie a real perfectly watchable and certainly also original one.7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Chronicle
9,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,I am an apex predator!,8,19 April 2012,"Andrew doesn't have the easiest high school experience. The others make fun of him, his mother is dying, and his father is an abusive drunk(and even so, we understand him... he used to be a firefighter, then he got injured on the job, and now can't earn enough for her medication, and is suffering under the loss of his work identity; a lot of characters(and only the bullies and the like are obnoxious, even though the trailer makes it look like this is full of them) in this are psychologically credible and evoke sympathy even when such would seem difficult to accomplish). He starts documenting his life, and uses that to place a barrier between him and his life... make it something constructed, a piece of fiction. His one friend is his cousin Matt, the pseudo-intellectual. Together with the popular Steve, running for class president(or something like that, anyway), the three find and enter a hole in the ground emitting strange, nonsensical sounds(insert Rush Limbaugh joke here)... why only those three, even when others reportedly found this anomaly? ...good question. It's actually one of the few gaps in the story. Anyway, once they emerge from there(how is never explained... it creates mystery), they find that they have gained telekinetic abilities... and our troubled lead is the most powerful. What happens when someone so downtrodden can do incredible things? They get so good that they can fly, as well, and that's kickass... well, once or twice, it's goofy, but mostly, it is cool. And they do what teenagers would do, in this situation... pull pranks and play airborne football(I guess the clouds are goalposts? And no, they do not ponder if they should become superheroes... how many people would, anyway?). And since the guy filming it(who, unlike a lot of these POV-pictures, or found footage ones, actually has a role, he isn't just there to explain why it's been recorded) enjoys having the camera float, so they can do the crane-shots, panning and closeups that wouldn't come about naturally from this... and no, it doesn't make sense that they'd shoot, say, arguing with each other, etc. This is well-written, with a good amount of humor along the way. The story is well-told and keeps to a solid structure. It is genuinely engaging and tense, with some scenes that really escalate. The FX are excellent. It uses the relatively(! It is 12 mil...!) low budget well. This keeps to a swift pace, not even breaking 90 minutes, and as it gets to the climax, it begins cutting to other views(everyone has cell-phones, and those can capture footage). There is a little bloody, disturbing violent content and moderate to strong language in this. I recommend this to everyone who enjoys stories like this. 8/10",Chronicle
10,neil-476,Very well done,8,2 February 2012,"Chronicle I wondered why this film was called Chronicle. It turns out to be because it is record begun by high schooler Andrew when he buys a video camera to chronicle his life. It becomes clear that Andrew's life is fairly miserable: his injury-retired father, watching his mother die of cancer, takes his unhappiness out on Andrew when he drinks, there is bullying at school and in the neighbourhood, no success with girls etc. Andrew is a loner, his only friend being his cousin Matt. Together with school achiever Steve, the three of them find - and are affected by - an underground maguffin (subsequently buried by subsidence). They all develop telekinetic powers, experimenting with them until they become skilled at using them. At which point Andrew finds that his life changes in a number of ways.The trailer for this film sells it as a kind of super-hero (or at least super-powers) film and, to be fair, in one respect that is exactly what it is. But it is also a study of Andrew: the damaged soul he is, how he came to be that way, and what effect the new powers have on him. I won't say more, but I will say that Dane DeHaan, looking a little DiCaprio-ish, does a good job as Andrew, changing credibly from victim to someone more in control of his destiny. After a slightly slow start, the film carries you along with it very well.And the effects are astonishingly good. I am now waiting for a bona fide super-hero movie to do super-hero effects as well as this one.",Chronicle
11,evanston_dad,"Clever Movie, But Enough with the ""Found Footage"" Gimmick!!",7,17 December 2012,"A clever spin on the super hero formula.Three buddies find a bizarre glowing object buried in a hole in a field. After coming in contact with it, they find that they are able to move things (including themselves) with their minds, a power that grows increasingly stronger as they exercise it. But one of the three, a bullied outcast, sees the potential to use his powers to get back at a world that he hates, and what begins as mostly harmless teenage boy pranks and antics becomes serious and deadly.I liked the question this movie posed: Under what obligation are people with super powers to use their powers responsibly? If this were a different kind of movie, that question might have been explored in more depth. But this isn't that kind of movie, and instead it heads into pretty standard good guy against bad guy standoff mode with a special effects-heavy climax. So while maybe not profound, it's still pretty entertaining.It also happens to be indirectly disturbing in the wake of so many recent school rampages, the one in Newtown, Connecticut being most recent. There seems to be an undercurrent of rage percolating in America's youth that is venting itself in terrifying ways, and it's not hard to read this film as an allegory for the themes recurring in our media culture.The only thing I distinctly disliked about this movie was the director's decision to film it in the ""found footage"" style. Everything in the movie is shot in first-person perspective, via someone's video camera, cell phone, etc. This is easy enough to accept at first, but becomes downright preposterous toward the end as victims continue to film (and quite adeptly at that) events even as they're trapped in cars being hurtled through the air. It's an unnecessary gimmick that takes the viewer out of the experience.Grade: B",Chronicle
12,FlashCallahan,Let's go to Tibet....,8,12 February 2012,"Another found footage movie, with an edge though.Three high school kids find a rock, and absorb some sort of power from it. Soon enough, they are able to control things using their mind, and soon enough turn on one another.The tailer for this movie is very deceptive, as is the element of found footage, as there are obviously parts toward the end that are just like a normal movie.But this has to be the best 'ff' movie since 'Troll Hunter', and one of the best American ones out there.The simple being is because the film is a lot of fun, and because of it's very slim running time, we get into the action more or less straight away.The three high school kids are good, but they are predictable, you know from the upstart that the geek is going to be the strongest, but forgive this minor blip,and there is lots to discover in this.What makes the film fun, is the fact that they are doing exactly what we would do if we had powers. We would impress to get status, we would fly, and we would want to go somewhere cool.But also, in the back of our minds, we know that we would have the power to do anything, and know that we would be one of the most powerful beings on earth, and this is where the film gets it's biggest credit.One moment, the films like a big summer break, it's a happy discovery to find what you have. The next in literally a bolt of lightning, the film turns very dark, and shows its evil side.sadly toward the end, the film ebbs toward some sort of fantastic four duel of sorts, and just becomes a tad annoying, like the main character.But for the majority of the film, it's powerful, gripping, and most of all, a lot of fun.It's great when films like this come out of nowhere and surprise you",Chronicle
13,phd_travel,amateurish - waste of time,1,6 February 2012,"I read the good reviews and saw it was number at the box office so I went to see it. Didn't enjoy this one at all.Basically the story is about 3 teens who acquire some telekintic powers but things get out of hand. It should have been quite good and exciting but it wasn't well done. The first part should have been fun to watch how they got and tried out their new powers but it felt cheap and unsatisfying. When things went wrong, it was unpleasant and out of sync with the earlier part. The script is bad - it doesn't transition well from the first part discovering the powers to the later part where things go wrong. The directing is abrupt and disjointed.Terribly unsatisfying feel to the story. I know they wanted it to be a dark type of story but it ended up being not entertaining. This movie has a cheap feel. The hand-held handy cam photography is headache inducing and doesn't show what is happening well.The cast is made up of relative unknowns - probably to give it a realistic feel. Don't waste your time or money. The worst movie for years to achieve such box office success.",Chronicle
14,trashgang,to watch for the effects alone,7,14 May 2012,"This is Josh Trank's first attempt to direct a full feature after doing the series The Kill Point. And what a f lick this was. Just when it becomes a bit ridiculous it changes into a disaster. Storywise I mean.I wouldn't classify it under a horror, definitely not, I would rather call it a drama with huge sci-fi undertones. Tree friends discover a hole and descent into it to discover something strange. It's not of this earth and they don't know what is happening to them when they touch the unearthed device. Slowly they see they have abilities that are supernatural. They use it well and people look amazed but one of the guys goes berserk when he misuses his powers. Things go from wrong to a disaster. Friendship is on the line.But what makes this flick watchable are the effects used. It starts all very simple with a few LEGO blocks and you get into it but once they discover they can fly it was for me a bit too cheesy. Luckily from that point the flick turns into a drama and the effects also become watching it with your mouth open. The acting was okay and believable. A strange flick but surely one to watch for the effects alone.Gore 1/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",Chronicle
15,deloudelouvain,Superpowers without superheroes,7,23 January 2017,I'm normally not a big fan of the handycam filming technique. In the beginning it was all new and okay but personally I think they should stop that technique. It doesn't do movies any good. Not that Chronicle is a bad movie though. It's definitely something else then the usual superhero movies that we see so much lately. Here three kids get telekinetic super powers after discovering a strange thing underground. What starts as a bit of fun quickly escalates in catastrophes. The story is easy to follow. It's different then the usual action heroes that use their powers to fight evil. The actors are all quite young and are not bad. Thinking about what they do with their powers makes me realize that I would probably try the same things. But it's all fiction. So all in all it's an entertaining movie to watch.,Chronicle
16,siderite,A good combination of Misfits and Akira,8,8 July 2012,"The film has a lot of qualities, which is not easy for a kids with special powers hand-held camera movie. It starts a lot like the Misfits show, with three random teens getting telekinetic powers from a crystal like thing in an underground tunnel, follows them around while they discover and experiment with their powers in ridiculous ways, then ends with the inevitable conclusion in situations where weak people get lots of power.The actors play well (although I am not sure Dane DeHaan will ever be able to get the role of a normal person any time soon), the special effects are subtle, but very well done, and the film captures the emotions of those involved perfectly, ranging from inadequacy, moving through camaraderie and pure joy and ending with despair.A really good sci-fi film, one that not only is a well done movie, but also makes a good point. And if you think it is a little boring at the beginning, bare with it; it will be worth it.",Chronicle
17,StevePulaski,Possesses a rare amount of energy and confidence,9,4 February 2012,"I haven't seen a good found footage film in a blue moon. Paranormal Activity 3 was an extremely poor addition to a franchise that once packed scares and creativity, Apollo 18 was a mediocre space thriller, and The Devil Inside was one of the most unpleasant films I've seen in years. Chronicle is some kind of a miracle in film. Not only is it a superb thriller and a great addition in the found footage genre, but it gives us a unique story, appealing characters, and doesn't dance around the faux documentary idea so many other films of the same genre do.Too many films in the found footage genre try to pass themselves off as legitimate, factual documentaries that show us ""real"" lost footage. If one were to research The Devil Inside expecting explicit details on ""the real story,"" they would be very, very disappointed. The film is compiled of several stories, with little tidbits of information taken from each. In other words, it's a jumbled up mess of a film that is further convoluted by not even taking the path of one solo idea. But I'm done reiterating why that film was so lackluster and dreadful. Chronicle is a much brighter, more entertaining film.It centers around three teens; Steve (Jordan) and cousins Matt (Russell) and Andrew (DeHaan). Andrew comes from a bad home life with an abusive, drunk father and a very ailing mother. The other two boys' homes aren't explored very much. One day, during a barn party, the boys sneak out to find a circular hole housing indescribable glowing objects. It's extremely deep, and the boys venture down there with the camera, hearing loud, auditory piercing noises before the camera blacks out.Next thing we, and presumably they know, they possess telekinetic powers. They can move things with their mind, and do a world of damage by a slight arm movement. When using their powers excessively, their noses bleed - sort of like a vehicle will smoke if overused. The first forty minutes, or so, is focused on fun and games with the boys and their newly found powers. It's fun, playful, and humorous watching these boys screw around with such amazing abilities. It's not until a little after the halfway point do things start to take a turn for the worse.Andrew becomes anti-social, scared, and more hostile towards his peers. He begins to use his powers for evil, rather than fun. He injures many, and seemingly is acting on impulse the entire time. The last twenty-five minutes or so utilize the idea of the film to a whole new extreme. It doesn't feel like an overused concept, but a properly used one, upgraded to full force without overstaying its welcome. It's perfectly captured at only eighty-three minutes, and doesn't feel winded or slow at any point.This isn't a typical found footage film - that we can kind of assume. It has end credits, and never claims anything is real. It's a movie, shot like it's real, yet still is fully aware it is a movie and nothing more. Not a faux anything. Just a science fiction film, creatively shot, and professionally edited. I believe the true reason it works is because it's basically erected off of someone's very detailed fantasy. We've all wished we've had telekinetic powers, now we want to see people using and abusing them.I also think that Max Landis, son of the director John, fleshes out these characters because he is aware of the kinds of caricatures we are faced with in current movies of the genre. Going back to Apollo 18, we basically spend time with three middle-aged men who are the most typical of the breed. Also, when it comes time for Andrew to start using his powers for evil, it never seems contrived. It gives a perfectly valid reason why he is upset and starting to lose it. The movie never feels like it is trying to fit its shoes in the already firmly created footsteps of the genre. It's far too clever to do such a thing.First time director Josh Trank fills the film with life and style, as well as keeping its appearance subtle but its delivery impressive. I can see the man having great success as an independent director in years to come. I can see the rest of the cast choosing smart, inventive pictures as well. This is the kind of film where it pushes new stars into a great big pool of optimism and opportunities. Chronicle is short, exciting, and possesses an amount of energy that I don't think has occupied a film of the area in quite sometime. Or at least since the first paranormal effort.Starring: Dane DeHaan, Michael B. Jordan, Michael Kelly, and Alex Russell. Directed by: Josh Trank.",Chronicle
18,KineticSeoul,Very good superhero with power movie that accomplished a lot with a low budget,8,8 April 2012,"Wow, they really went all out in making a good superhero movie with such a low budget. There has been low budget superhero movies in the past that were decent or even good but the heroes had no power. But in this 3 teens have powers and one of the coolest powers ever which is telekinesis. There was a movie about a group of teens with the power to teleport which is called ""Jumper"" but as a movie it seems telekinesis is more fun to watch. This one is better than ""Push"" although that one had a bigger budget. The premise is this a 3 stumble upon a hole outside a rave party and decide to go in it and this mysterious object which isn't explained in the movie gives them telekinesis. And majority of the movie shows these teens pulling harmless pranks and doing harmless cool stuff with there powers and gets some entertainment out of it. Now these teens are boyscouts cause even though they have this awesome power they don't have any ill intentions of doing bad things or harming others by using it. But one of them is a loser and is very depressed with his life and thus ends up snapping. Yeah he does go through some issues but what he does with his powers is over the top considering he has an awesome power and him being the most talented with his gift makes him the most dangerous. Anyways he reminded me of those losers that committed the Columbine shooting. Now this is a found footage movie with the characters or at least the main character who is also the villain in this movie video taping everything. But that is what sort of takes away from this movie cause more than the power of telekinesis itself the way just about every character video tapes every crucial moments or even moments to move the story along just comes off ridiculous. Especially the main fight near the end with two characters with telekinesis duking it out. It just doesn't make sense how the fight sequences are all being video taped so well, especially during crucial scenes. Yeah, found footage direction starts off pretty cool and it works in the beginning but slowly gets ridiculous as it progresses. With such a low budget this one is a amazing achievement and it's better than some high budget superhero movies because it's more engaging even if the characters with powers ain't comic book heroes. I give this movie a 8 because of what it accomplished with so little compared to most Hollywood flicks.8/10",Chronicle
19,Hellmant,Spider-Man gone bad!,8,22 April 2012,"'CHRONICLE': Four Stars (Out of Five) Another 'found footage' film, this one deals with three high school friends who develop telekinetic powers after coming into contact with a strange object. It was directed by Josh Trank and written by Trank and Max Landis. It stars Dane DeHaan, Alex Russell, Michael B. Jordan and Michael Kelly. The film is a little more unique and original than your usual 'found footage' film and it's a somewhat memorable film going experience because of it.DeHaan stars as high school outcast Andrew. Andrew has problems at home with an abusive alcoholic father (Kelly) and a sick mother (Bo Petersen). His only friend at school is his cousin Matt (Russell) and he's taken up filming all his daily activities with an HD camera. His life takes a sudden turn when he, Matt and popular classmate Steve (Jordan) find a mysterious object underground. They develop telekinetic powers from it and begin to bond because of it. Things get out of control when they continue to get stronger and stronger.The film is sort of like an anti-superhero film (like Spider-Man gone bad). DeHaan is reminiscent of a young Leonardo DiCaprio and does a good job in the lead. The rest of the cast is not so impressive. The script is smart though and the directing is effective. It kind of feels like the movie was building towards something more than it ends up delivering but for the most part it works.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A55VyvDcEBI",Chronicle
20,thesar-2,With Great Power Comes Little Responsibility,2,4 February 2012,"Imagine for once, you're a high school kid: shy, secluded, wimpy, gets beaten down and then BAM!, you, your cousin and friend get these fantastic powers! You can get back at the bullies, fly to Tibet on a whim and fight back that bad, bad father.Now, imagine that same kid is bland, boring, brainless and brings little to the table – his super-friends, too – and the ""special powers"" are all-but a backdrop to whatever's (not) happening on the screen. Sounds like a fun time?It's hard not to put yourself in the shoes of these Teen Titans of 'Chronicle' (1½/5 Stars) and when you do you should be thoroughly disappointed in these shallow kids' discovery.Literally, or BARELY, nothing changes in these kids' lives following an alien encounter that leaves the three with the ability of telekinesis. And that's not a good thing: these boys didn't have that much depth or anything going for them prior and following, they have even less. Oh, there's some ""training"" and a girly, girl-podcaster side story that's about as interesting as watching Bella and Edward's courtship, but other than that, these fools do not act like normal kids who would find themselves much stronger than the day before. (One example, after a good friend dies, the first instinct, at least in this reality, is to film the funeral in some art-house fashion and then, its business as usual following. The supposedly far-lesser realistic kids of Elm Street showed more emotion towards their lost friends at each film's obligatory funeral.)I was a teenage boy once; I read comics, watched superhero movies and daydreamed a lot. Like what would happen if I had the ability of flight, invulnerability and the power to move objects with my mind through my hand. This, mercifully, short film was NOTHING like I imagined. These punks might as well been given a used iPad vs. abnormal abilities.There were enough misfires in this film that I left the theatre and said to myself: ""Thanks for the preview. Now, I can't wait to see the real movie!""But, beyond – or beneath – these squandered opportunities, I got the sense I was watching a film-school student movie that used the tired and old hand-held/lost-footage genre as the ""twist."" Let me tell you: when this is the 50th rip off since 'The Blair Witch Project,' it's no longer fresh. Hell, I've seen two new ones in the theatre this year in just five weeks. And aside from the genre being played out since 'Cloverfield' in 2008, I believe they're getting worse and worse with less and less happening until they all are equal to the over-long YouTube videos they really are.Okay, forgetting all that, what's left is some bad acting juxtaposed with bad dialogue, mediocre special effects – some of which were down-right pitiful (the stock-footage, cloudy sky green-screen shots and transposed geeks almost made me spit out my soda) and far-fetched camera angles or uses of the camera POVs. The whole finale was questionable, unless we're led to believe that some secret government agency went around collecting everyone's phones and cameras or both to splice together what happened. But, worse than that, was the brief, off-camera policeman saying they had to leave the cameras (yeah, two for whatever logical reason) on in a hospital room while someone was SLEEPING, possibly in a coma. Reason? It's part of the investigation. That was too obvious of a set up, bloody amateurish on the filmmaker's part and all-out jaw-dropping laughable. (No joke: I said ""WHAT?"" when I was in the theatre and then laughed after the words ""part of the investigation"" sank in and reminded me of an old MST3k film.)Even though they NEEDLESSLY had to remind us every few minutes (or less) that they're holding a camera for their self-explained ""no-explanation,"" I admit this odd-super-hero film was just slightly better than 'Hancock' but nowhere near as exciting or interesting as the other odd-titled-lost-footage movie: 'Cloverfield.' Since it wasn't even well paced, it's not worth the time, even at under an hour and a half.(On a cheery side note, I thought I would like it more when 2 of the 3 main characters were named Steve and Andrew – my first and middle names. Although, it might have been a tad bit creepy if the third were strangely named ""Reeves"")",Chronicle
21,cherold,Excellent movie is both entertaining and thoughtful,8,27 October 2012,"There are a few different ways you can go with a movie about teens who develop strange powers. Nowadays that usually seems to involve superheroes, but Chronicle doesn't show much interest in being usual. This movie tries to follow its premise through logically, considering what could happen with these particular characters in these particular circumstances.Because of that, the cool special effects and action scenes never feel like popcorn action material designed to get wows from the crowd. Instead they feel like they are part of the process of telling this particular story. Characters are well defined, especially the damaged lead, and everything unfolds convincingly. All the humor, all the action, all the drama, make sense.Even what could be argued is the the most gimmicky part of the movie, that it is all shot by participants with video cameras, is unobtrusive and convincing, feeling far less gimmicky than in other movies that use a similar approach. Like everything else, it comes out of the characters. I saw this movie on a day I was injured and could do nothing but sit on the couch and watch TV. I saw a whole bunch of bad movies and one okay movie and was wondering if maybe I just don't like movies anymore when I watched this one. This is how it's supposed to be done.ADDENDUM: Several years later I watched this movie a second time, because I didn't remember watching it before. Not a thing in it seemed familiar!After that second review I would have rated it 7, and I thought that while the found-video approach was fine, I'm not sure it added anything over just filming it in the more traditional fashion. I don't know if I overrated it last time because I saw several bad movies in a row or whether I'm underrating it this time!",Chronicle
22,FeastMode,ummmmm yeah,9,25 June 2019,"Amazing movie. awesome story, interesting premise, great action, very funny, and a very deep psychological aspect to it. beastly directing. by far the best ""found footage"" movie imo. they used it in so many creative ways. and they kept true to it. when a camera was far you couldn't hear the words they were saying, just their voices. or the security footage having no sound. it was so impactful and made it feel real.

i loved the way they expanded on the original premise. how they could eventually fly, and put a forcefield around themselves. i loved how in the beginning they were learning it, practicing, messing with people, etc. i also liked that the nerdy kid that everyone picks on is not the good guy but the villain. it makes you think that after all the psychological damage that he went through, when he finally had the power to do something about it, he used it for revenge, etc instead of good. as a smart uncle once said, with great power comes great responsibility.but i think the thing that got me the most was his psychopathic behavior. so many dark scenes gave me the chills, super goosebumps, like when he took apart the spider. that's messed up.",Chronicle
23,bowmanblue,Surprisingly awesome,9,5 March 2015,"I hated this film. And then after about 15-20 minutes I absolutely loved it.This is one of those 'filmed from a video camera' movies (think Blair Witch and Cloverfield). This, on its own, bugged me, but not as much as the main character - who really annoyed me. That was until I realised he was actually meant to be pretty annoying. Then he becomes funny. He films his family at home. And gets beaten up for it. He also constantly films he fellow pupils at school. And gets beaten up for it. He goes to parties, films people there, and generally gets beaten up because of it. He's a complete idiot - not the sort of person you want to get super powers.Unfortunately, he and two others then go on to get super powers. He's still an idiot, but, from being the poor, hard-done-by outsider, becomes something much darker and this is where the fun really starts.I thought Chronicle was going to be some sort of 'Heroes' clone all about teenagers. And, despite being about teenagers is much darker than its contemporaries.It's one of those films that, if I was telling a friend about I, I'd only tell them that its great and worth-seeing. I'd try to avoid too many plot details as I'd want anyone who watches it to go into it not knowing too much about it.A great watch. So glad I didn't turn it off after 15-20 minutes. A lesson for my attention span indeed.",Chronicle
24,ThomasDrufke,Young Actors Shine In Smart and Fresh Superhero Movie,8,14 May 2014,"This is a really cool movie. Not only because the effects for a 12 mil budget movie are top notch, but because of how different this film is. I have never seen something like this before. Im not a horror junkie so I'm not too familiar with the found footage type of film. In fact as far as I know this is the first movie that I've seen with almost all found footage. The approach really works. Probably due to the tremendous directorial job done by Josh Trank. He created these 3 characters that become more engaging as the film progresses. Dane Dehaan and Michael B Jordan will be stars someday but I also really liked Alex Russel in the movie as well. Perhaps this will be a movie we look back at in 10 years and were looking at multiple Oscar winners all in the same small budget superhero film.The difference between this and an X-Men film is not just the small budget though. This movie dives much deeper into the back story of a disturbed teenager and gives us a glimpse at how someone who is given so much power but at the same time is abused goes through on a day to day basis. It was devastating seeing Andrew go through this abuse and see his villain turn develop in front of our eyes and not help the kid out. Perhaps the one thing the film was lacking is the back story involving exactly how they got their powers. You see them touch this illuminated object underground but never get the sense of how exactly they are given this ability to fly and move objects. I also didn't find the father to be as terrifying as he was made out to be. Nonetheless this movie is a breakthrough in the superhero genre and a refreshing take on the found footage approach.If they do eventually make a sequel I hope it follows Alex Russel's character instead of having a new group of kids as what was rumored. Keep Trank and Landis on as consultants and I think it could be potentially good.+ surprisingly great effects+ great performances from young leadsnot enough of a back story8.6/10",Chronicle
25,g-bodyl,Stumbling Upon Power!,8,12 July 2013,"I wanted to avoid Chronicle at all costs because of the found footage genre, but I just couldn't give it up because of the awesome premise. Yes, the shaky camera for the first two-thirds was awfully annoying, but this film features some great up and coming talent. It's well directed, well-written, well-acted, and has really cool special effects.Josh Trank's film is about how three ordinary high school kids stumble upon a hole and later discover they have superpowers. After they had their powers for awhile, they begin to discover that these powers may have a dark side.The acting is really good for a bunch of unknown actors. Dane DeHaan is pretty good, if a little bit of a crybaby. I liked Alex Russell and Michael B. Jordan the most. Their performances were actually quite believable.Overall, this is a solid debut film and another good entry into the superhero genre. For a found footage film, this is awesome. But, I still haven't gain enough respect for the genre to start liking it. But Chronicle is a good way to start, not those Paranormal Activity films. I rate this film 8/10.",Chronicle

At first they just begin to mess around with their new powers and mess with people. When the begin to grow stronger they are forced to decide weather to use them for good or evil. I was actually looking forward to this movie. The preview made it seem a little ""X-Men"" like and I though it would be a neat idea. Almost from the beginning I was disappointed. I do however think that this is a movie meant for teenagers and not for me a 33 year old. To me this was a cross between a ton of different movies, most notably ""Hancock"" and ""Superman 3"", but really almost a blender full of movies. My biggest problem with this one is that it had no plot at all. This is pretty much a reality show about kids with superpowers. If scenes like the kids messing with some lady's car by moving it to another parking spot or eating chips without touching them with their hands is what you are looking for then this is for you. On a side note I think that the fake-documentary genre has run its course and needs to stop. Overall, a plot less movie that I think is geared toward teens, not for me. I give it a C+.",Chronicle
28,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews,7,18 May 2012,"Chronicle The most unrealistic thing about super heroism is that a human with extraordinary powers would don a disguise and avoid publicity.Fortunately, the superpowered friends in this sci-fi movie are keeping a video diary of their impossible exploits.When Andrew (Dane DeHaan), a loser who's taken enough abuse in school and in the home, begins documenting his meager existence, it sudden becomes not so meager.When he and his cousin (Alex Russell), begin chronicling the eerie sounds emanating from an excavation, the star-football player (Michael B. Jordan) encourages them to investigate.Inside they uncover a radiant rock that bathes them in an unearthly glow that imbues them with psychokinesis and the power of flight.An ultra realistic take on superpowers, Chronicle is an ingenious and freighting account of unchecked ability.Incidentally, the first thing that one should do after becoming a super-hero is to sell their film rights to Hollywood.

30,The-Sarkologist,One Boy's Descent into Madness,8,5 February 2012,"To describe this movie as a love it or hate it style movie is what I sort of get from the reviews, though I would fall into a 'pretty good' category myself. The reason I saw it was because I wanted to take my brother to see a movie, and out of the movies that were showing at out local cinema, this seemed to be the best (I was really not interested in seeing a 3D version of Star Wars episode 1, though I might go and see it another time, my brother loves Star Wars).The home video movie genre is starting to become more popular, possibly because the effects that can be used are becoming more developed as well. I remember that the first movie of this style was Blair Witch Project, and in a way there have not been many followers. It is a style of movie that if done well, will make for a very realistic and very gritty movie. Paranormal Activity was okay, but Cloverfield was awesome (now where is my copy of that movie, I simply cannot remember where I put it). This movie, I believe, did pull it off quite well, and noting that the director is new to the game, suggests that this is one of those style of films that budding directors should consider. However, it should be remembered that one needs to be careful because it can easily create a movie that is rubbish.Chronicle tells the story of three teenagers that find a strange crystal underground, and later on discover that they have superpowers. However this is not your standard teenager gets superpowers type of movie, but rather revolves around a single boy, Andrew Detmar, who's life is positively terrible. As some have suggested, Detmar is a prime candidate for somebody to simply lose the plot and go storming through his school with a gun shooting everybody in sight. His character is a very difficult character to play, and I believe it was pulled off quite well.While there is a lot that can be said about this film, the focus is on Detmar and his descent into madness. He is truly a tragic hero. We do sympathise with him, but only to a point. His mother is dying and his father is a brute who takes what every opportunity he has to beat him up. It is quite satisfying when Detmar finally lets lose on his father with his superpowers. However, at school he is also generally neglected, bullied, and ridiculed. However this is where the sympathy ends, because he doesn't gain his powers on his own, but with two others, and while they discover their powers and begin to bond, Detmar is so used to being the outcast that he does not understand the nature of their friendship, so he begins to reject them.It is when his mother is on her last legs that he decides to use his powers to help her, but in doing so lands up in hospital. Here his father blames him for his mother's dead, at which point he explodes in rage, drops him from ten stories up (only to have him saved), and the begins rampaging through the city of Seatle. It is only with a hard heart that his cousin, seeing that he has past the point of no return, that he is forced to kill him.This is not a superhero film in the traditional sense. There is no super villain, and they do not go out fighting crime and making the city a better place to live. They have fun, and play with their powers, and even joke around, however it appears that they would prefer to keep them to themselves. Detmar, though, uses it to amplify his rage at society. He is clearly mentally unstable, and is almost a warning to us that any amount of power in the hands of such an unstable person is disastrous. As some arguments have suggested, one does not need superpowers to be a threat, all one needs is a gun.I guess I like to speculate on how I would handle it, though I must say that while I empathise with his bullying at school, I have a supportive and loving family. In Detmar's case it appeared (at least to him) that the entire world was hostile (which is not the case, since he did have friends). In his place, I would serious have stood up to the father, making it very clear that I would not be pushed around, and with the powers that I would have, it would be very easy to turn him into a snivelling shadow of the brute he once was. Even more satisfying is that nobody would believe him that his son had super powers and was beating him up. As for school I would be subtle, very, very subtle, but in doing so would you my powers to completely embarrassing the bullies. For instance making their trousers fall down in front of everybody, causing them to trip and fall numerous times, but it would be on the sporting field where I would have the most fun.This movie is good though, and some of the scenes, such as when they are tosing the football about 20 000 feet about the ground, and then narrowly miss being hit by a jumbo is just golden. It is a very clever, and really well made movie that explores the human condition, and looks at how somebody to degenerate into such a monster where he lashes out and seeks to destroy all around him. Such is the society in which we live.",Chronicle

33,tomgillespie2002,"Exciting, well-acted, and strangely believable superhero film",7,9 February 2013,"Barely a week goes by these days without another superhero film. They are no longer simply movies for pale-skinned nerds still living with their mothers, but complex, emotional character studies, complete with high-octane action and some of the best special-effects that money can buy. Yet for every The Dark Knight Rises (2012), there's a Jonah Hex (2009), proving that such a luxury in abundance is not necessarily a good thing. You can not simply give a character powers, dress him in a silly suit, and expect box-office millions - something that especially Marvel have realised, who place serious consideration into their output and making some left-field production choices in terms of cast and crew. Clearly aware of this, director Josh Trank and screenwriter Max Landis created a superhero film with a twist, incorporating that other popular sub-genre, the found-footage movie, and with Chronicle, we have something very familiar, yet deceptively fresh.Teenager Andrew (Dane DeHaan), starts to videotape his life, documenting everything from the domestic abuse he suffers from the hands of his father, his dying mother, and his unhappy school life. His only real friend is his cousin Matt (Alex Russell), who he was close to growing up, but drifted away from as they both got older. After being attacked and thrown out of a party, Andrew is approached by the popular Steve (Michael B. Jordan), who asks Andrew to capture something strange he and Matt have found, which turns out to be a tunnel hiding a glowing crystalline object. As a result, the trio start to develop telekinetic abilities that cause their noses to bleed when they overreach themselves, but working like a muscle, getting stronger with practice. But after Andrew pushes a rude driver into a ditch, almost killing him, they agree to limit the use of their powers, especially when used against other humans, which proves difficult as Andrew's psychological unbalance begins to reveal itself.Chronicle's plot naturally put a lot of faith into the character of Andrew. Everything is viewed through his 'eyes', with his ever-present camera placing a psychological boundary between him and the real world. He is an often pathetic, unlikeable protagonist, but in the hands of Dane DeHaan, Andrew is simply fascinating to watch - an unconventional, multi-dimensional anti-hero. I predicted big things for DeHaan after his portrayal of gay, angry teenager Jessie in HBO's excellent In Treatment, where he even managed to overshadow Gabriel Byrne, and his terrific performance here will surely allow him to go on to bigger and better things (although so far I have only seen him in small roles in Lawless and Lincoln (both 2012)). Watching Andrew slowly lose his grip on reality and lose himself in the idea that he is an apex predator is like watching the birth of a great comic-book villain.The found-footage approach works surprisingly well, giving a realism to the various scenes of (often brutal) violence, and some entertaining light-touches as they record themselves playing with their powers in Youtube style. The 'problem' with someone having to hold the camera is rectified when Andrew realises he can use his telekinetic abilities to operate the camera, leading to an inspired scene where the trio play football in the clouds, having discovered they can fly. The slightly underwhelming climax over-reaches itself, abandoning the found-footage technique completely and losing itself amongst all the special effects, becoming an unoriginal study of the damning effects of power. But this is a minor quibble in what is an exciting, well-acted, and strangely believable superhero film.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Chronicle
34,Thanos_Alfie,Super powers...,6,13 December 2018,"""Chronicle"" is a Sci-Fi - Thriller movie in which we watch three high school friends finding something extraordinary underground that cannot be explained and gain superpowers. All started after their new discovery and at first, they were feeling different and sometime later they were able to move things with their mind. As they continued to use their new abilities they were becoming stronger and it was more difficult for them to be able to control their own powers, something had to be done in order for them to be able to control them.I liked this movie because it was very interesting and it had a very new plot. Despite the short length of it, it covered with many details the potential plot holes that had been produced without leaving us with any question at the end. I liked the interpretation of Michael B. Jordan who played as Steve Montgomery and he was very good at his role even if it was something more different than we are used to watching him play now. Other interpretations that have to be mentioned are Dane DeHaan who played as Andrew Detmer and Alex Russell who played as Matt Garetty. Regarding the direction which was made by Josh Trank, it was very interesting with some very well placed plot twists and an equally good script.Finally, I have to say that ""Chronicle"" is a nice movie and it is worth watching it because it combines very well Sci-Fi with drama and that is something very different from every other movie you have ever watched. I recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that you are going to enjoy it. Especially if you are a fan of Sci-Fi movies then I believe that you are going to be impressed with this movie, just don't expect very good CGI because you are going to be disappointed by it.",Chronicle

He is the lead that purchases a camcorder at the beginning of the film to chronicle his life. Andrew's only buddy is his cousin Matt (Alex Russell), whose seeming cool masks the usual insecurities. Steve (Michael B. Jordan) is an outgoing and popular guy. They become a trio when Matt and Steve discover a weird sinkhole that opens into a cave and induce Andrew to descend into it with them and his camera. Once inside, they discover some kind of Fortress of Solitude-like hub with a light show and a crystal that apparently bestows upon them the gift of telekinesis. From there on, the story begins and what happens becomes a mystery which one must pay close attention to see how everything unfolds, for better or worse.",Chronicle
36,TheMovieDiorama,"Chronicle manages to utilise the ""found footage"" technique to create an effective teen sci-fi.",7,24 February 2018,"It dabbles into various genres during its short runtime. Sci-fi, high school drama, thriller and even the superhero sub-genre. Surprisingly, despite the meaty contents, they all blend well. A small group of students stumble across a peculiar underground rock. They progressively start to realise they have acquired unique abilities and use them to their advantage, despite the consequences. At the centre of all the crazy happenings is Andrew, a troubled boy who lives a difficult life. His is unpopular at school, abused at home by his alcoholic father and is having to care for his ill mother. It details the effects of emotional trauma and how it can effect someone mentally. Andrew's troubled life has lead him to feel pure anger and hatred. We then view the positives and negatives of using telekinetic powers for one's own desire, falsifying a sense of popularity only for it to then come crashing down. It's a personal story, all captured on Andrew's camera, told through his perspective. The endearing aspect to this film is the chemistry between the three lead characters. They explore their powers together and form a close friendship, I found them to be relatable and incredibly lifelike. Dane DeHaan steals the film and portrays his character's development with ease. Also him saying ""I'm feeling really spelunked out actually"" just feels...satisfying. I don't know, I'm weird like that. Josh Trank's direction was solid where he really positioned the camera in inventive ways, particularly during the flying scenes. The low budget does unfortunately show during those scenes and the effects during the destructive third act detracted from the quality of the film. Also how they found the underground cavern to begin with felt coincidental and far too rushed. However, Chronicle is one of the better ""found footage"" films that genre enthusiasts will love. And if there is one thing it's taught me, never mess with an apex predator.",Chronicle
37,matthewssilverhammer,Wonderful Teenage Superhero Melodrama,8,10 July 2017,"Chronicle takes the found footage technique & uses it beautifully in the teenage melodrama/superhero worlds, opening with a heart-wrenching moment between the main character & his dad banging on his door. Through found sudden superpowers, we have some blatant parallels to puberty that work, & the teenage philosophizing is great for the characters. The effects are crisp, & the final battle is full of pathos & excitement. Trank's later meltdown is a shamewould so love to get more from this universe.",Chronicle
38,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Unique superpower riff that captures more realism than its big-budget counterparts,7,16 February 2012,"Since the Golden Age of comic books, folks have been imagining what it would be like if ordinary people came across extraordinary power. But not until 2012 with ""Chronicle"" has anyone truly attempted to capture this notion with a sense of realism. Josh Trank and Max Landis have done just that with their low-budget found-footage take on superpower archetypes.Found footage has exploded in the last 10 years. ""The Blair Witch Project"" just scratched the surface of the storytelling method's appeal toward the general public as well as the medium's secret ability to convince people that because it looks real, we for some reason must psychologically react to it as if it's real.Creating the illusion is about more than using lesser-quality lenses, however. At just 26 years old, Landis and Trank understand today's teens better than anyone making wide-release Hollywood movies right now. The trio at the film's center gets it too, and it results in some believable characters who react to developing telekinetic superpowers in ways you'd expect teenagers to: pranks, general tomfoolery and showing off.Although three teenagers come across this power, the story belongs to Andrew (Dane DeHaan), a loner who gets bullied at school in addition to a depressing home life that includes a deathly ill mother and an abusive father. He begins recording his life as if to document his misery (not a stretch considering the number of personal YouTube channels out there), and this serves as our only window into the story.After his cousin Matt (Alex Russell) convinces him to come to a barn rave (kids these days), Andrew, Matt and Matt's friend Steve (Michael B. Jordan), the most popular kid in his class, discover a hole in the ground. Upon exploring it underground, they find some kind of alien object, and the next thing we know they have telekinetic abilities, powers that grow stronger over time.The boys' newfound strength forges a secret bond between them, and Andrew has friends for the first time. He even uncovers some popularity—a loner's fantasy realized. But Andrew is also emotionally volatile. Unlike his friends, he lacks control over his life, and after an incident in which he pushes a car off the road and into a pond, things change drastically, both in the story and in the tone of the film.For a good chunk of the movie, Trank and Landis use their unique premise to explore how one's use of power and control can be dictated by personality, emotional wellness and social status. In no other phase of life do these feelings wield greater emotional consequences than in one's teenage years.As much as you want to believe Andrew can step back and look at things logically and communicate feelings rather than bottle them up (as Matt and Steve so often try to get him to do), you know he's going to pop at some point. Fascinatingly, he is both our main character and our source of antagonism in the story and it actually works. The film plays tug of war between sympathy and outrage at how Andrew handles his situation to keep the audience riveted.What happens next can only be described as gutsy. Things take a dark and chaotic turn and the scope of the story goes beyond what found-footage movies ought to do. The story remains gripping enough to keep us invested in the outcome, but it's a wild, wild ride that might lose some viewers in the process.The found footage gets tough for Trank to keep up in this final act, and it makes one question why it was necessary at all. Security cameras, cell phones and other people's assorted recording devices document this part of the story because the original documenter is off driving film's course of events, yet it's all perfectly edited together. ""Found footage"" would seem to imply the importance of the story being documented in a realistic manner, but that's not the case with ""Chronicle."" The medium appears to be utilized here solely for that authenticated look and to allow us access to personal moments for the characters. As such, Landis' biggest challenge as a writer had to be making up excuses for the camera to be in the right place at the right time.As striking and powerful as the climax of ""Chronicle"" is, it blows the door way too wide open. What began as such an intimate story to start finishes like a blockbuster. An exciting finish to be sure (on $11 million especially), but one with a cognizant disregard for the tone of the earlier acts of the movie. It's not a disappointment, but it could have concluded more meaningfully if done on a smaller scale.Especially when you consider that it's a rookie effort on multiple counts, ""Chronicle"" impresses with its unique riff on super stories. It also proves that a $200-million budget is not a prerequisite to making a movie about people with extraordinary powers. Considering it probes deeper into human psychology and power dynamics than those studio tent-poles, maybe those franchises need to take a good hard look at themselves.~Steven CThanks for reading!

39,DarkVulcan29,Super powered teens told through the point of view from a video camera.,8,9 February 2012,"The whole video camera has been done to death, The Blair Witch Project, Cloverfield, and the cinematic travesty known as Apollo 18. Going into Chronicle, I was had my doubts. But I was very surprised, Chronicle did the whole video camera quite well.Social outcast Andrew(Dane Dehaan) his cousin Matt(Alex O'Russell) and his friend Steve(Michael B. Jordan) one night while at a party, find a hole in the wilderness, they go in it, and find a mysterious glowing thing, they get close to it, and the next they all discover, they all have super powers. They all decide to have fun with it. But what happens when they grow too strong with it? Chronicle met my expectations, I really liked all three main characters, the actors where all memorable, I liked Dane Dehaan, and Alex O' Russell, and Michael B. Jordan, I really liked the Steve character, cause it was nice to see a popular kid, who was not a jerk for once. It had awesome special effects, which was probably not easy, trying to be told through the point of view from a video camera. Chronicle is like a Twilight Zone episode, it blends science fiction, and some elements of reality.",Chronicle
40,freemantle_uk,What would you do if you had superpowers?,9,22 September 2013,"In recent years there has been an explosion of found footage films thanks to the success of films like Cloverfield and Paranormal Activity and the growth of digital technology. Found footage films are cheap and often turn a profit, regardless of quality. Fortunately Chronicle is a very well made, interesting take on the idea of people developing superpowers.Andrew (Dane DeHaan) is a high school student in Seattle with an abusive dad and dying mum. At school he is bullied and considered weird and creep. His only friend his is cousin Matt (Alex Russell). When at a party Matt and the popular student Steve (Michael B. Jordan) find a strange hole they ask Andrew to film it and the trio end up developing telekinetic powers. They slowly develop their powers with Andrew being the strongest. But years of resentment and pain builds up in Andrew and his dark side develops.Chronicle had an organic progression as the relationship between the young men's relationship grows as their test their powers to the deterioration when Andrew's emotions get the better of him. The relationship is natural with Steve being made out to be a likable guy who actually wants to help Andrew and it feels believable that these three different lads who become friends.DeHaan is particularly strong as Andrew as the character is finally has friends, finally has power before turning into a psychopath. Even if Chronicle was not a sci-fi film it could have easily have about a story about a alienated young man who wants to take out his revenge against a world who always hated him. A rewrite could have turned the film into someone who plans and carries out a high school massacre.Chronicle is a first time film for director Josh Trank and writer Max Landis and they do portray a slightly take of the superhero genre as the characters test out their powers, play jokes, having to make up rules after they go too far and Andrew's moralising of his actions. The high school setting also felt really believable compared to other portrayals of high school.The found footage style worked for Chronicle as the story was engaging and Trank was able to play with the camera because of the telekinetic powers. As the film progresses Trank uses more cameras like security cameras and he gets some great shots and adds to the atmosphere. A particular shot I really like was the camera was stationery and we see a flight between Andrew and his dad which reminded me of fight scene in Unbreakable. Chronicle is a solid sci-fi drama, but it is the final third where Andrew becomes aggressive and insane and takes a darker turn. It was helped by DeHaan's intense performance. The final act was a great action battle between two superpowered teens in Seattle. It is even more impressive considering the low budget Chronicle had. At 81 minutes, Chronicle does cover a lot of territory in its short running time, and not just about superpowers, but also about high school life, the effects of domestic abuse and how would people act if they had some sort of power. It is easy to compare Chronicle to Unbreakable, a film about someone developing superpowers and Stephen King's Carrie, a teenager who is bullied who develops telekinetic powers and also goes crazy when humiliated. But if you are going to take ideas from other material, at least take from good material.8.5/10",Chronicle
41,strong-122-478885,"A Loser's Ultimate Wet-Dream-Come-True, Chronicled",1,21 February 2013,"*Note* Possible spoilers! Here's Chronicle's message to all-time loser teens?In order to gain any acceptance at all from any of your peers you must first acquire super-powers. That's right. It's the only way. Otherwise you will continue to be subjected to the same, old treatment that you so rightly deserve - Like being punched in the head at least 3 times a day by not only your fellow classmates (while others, doing nothing, look on), but by your very own father, as well.Now, I ask you - Wasn't it just the most amazing coincidence imaginable that Andrew suddenly started to diligently record everything on camera just days before he and his mates just happened to discover the hole in the ground and, thus, miraculously becoming the 3 bad-ass ""superboys""? I know that Andrew, Matt & Steve did actually return once again to the site of the mysterious hole and it was, at that point, filled in. But, what doesn't make sense to me was, later, when their super-strength had increased, why didn't they return again to open up the hole and maybe that way they could've gotten some sensible answers to this whole, weird phenomenon?In Chronicle it totally killed me that pretty, little Casey was also a hand-held movie camera fanatic, as well. I mean, she clung to her precious camera so possessively that even when she was falling from Seattle's space-needle, and Matt caught her in mid-air, she never let go of the frickin' thing. And while she was filming during this fall the shots were all totally 100% clear with only a minimal amount of shaking.... Sheesh!Chronicle was one of those films that just about bored me to tears. It took a whole hour out of its 84 minute running time finally to get to all of the mayhem and carnage stuff and by that time I was so fed up with this utter crap movie that I couldn't have cared less what sort of awesome destruction was about to take place.And finally, I ask you - After you've killed someone, don't you think that it's just a little too late to be saying complete nonsense to the dead person like ""I'm sorry"", and especially the most nauseating line of all ""I love you""???? In my opinion, Matt's hypocritical, little speech to now-dead Andrew at the end of the film was so bloody hollow and despicable that at that point I really wished that I could've leaned over and spit right there in his stupid, smug, little face.",Chronicle
42,dfranzen70,Wish I had a reason to like this,4,10 December 2012,"I suppose Chronicle is a sufficient movie, but I wouldn't call it enjoyable. It has a bit of a nasty streak, a relatively incoherent plot, and a brief running time, although the latter might be considered a positive. It's grimy, unreasonable, and seems to give off a generally displeased vibe, as if it just didn't want to be made in the first place.The plot synopsis says that three friends find Something underground that gives each of them telekinetic powers. Well, two of them are cousins who only kind of tolerate each other, and one is an introvert with whom the other two hang only because he has a HD videocamera. Comes in handy when you want to film yourself flying around Seattle.Yes, it's another movie shown through the perspective of another camera lens. In some movies, this gambit works; the process makes the viewer feel more a part of things, as if he or she is experiencing the story just as the characters are. Here, though, we feel conversely removed from the proceedings, as if we're watching a movie being filmed. That's because quite a bit of suspension of disbelief is required for this kind of movie, and trying to introduce the veritas of a camera just doesn't gel with the intent.Andrew (Dane DeHaan) is the kid with the camera, Alex Russell plays his smart cousin Matt, and Michael B. Jordan is class president/popular kid Steve. At a rave - yes, they do still exist - the three find a big hole, wind up in it, find something that's not explained (doesn't have to be) and soon find they can lift objects, including themselves.The basic morality of the movie is the use of their new powers - for fun, for good, or for something else? Matt wants rules, such as no hurting people. Andrew, who has been repressed and abused for most of his life, chafes at that possibility. Steve just sort of wants to have fun. Matt uses these new-found powers to help get Andrew out of his shell - he knocks 'em dead at the school's talent show and is the man of the hour at the big party afterwards - but it's soon obvious that the years of pent-up rage are affecting Andrew along with his powers, and something's gotta give.I don't need to tell you what. Bad things happen. Friendships are questioned. There is death and plenty of mayhem. After a while, I stopped being interested in the dynamics within the Steve-Matt-Andrew friendship, and even the effects became rather lame, uninspired, and impotent. We see them fly, even toss a football while way up in the sky, but we don't get to see them fly through the city, a la Spider-man. Well, you know what I mean. We see a lot of little stuff, then some parlor tricks. The film moves as if it's late for something. When a character turns, you expect to feel something - glee, disdain - but here there's nothing to be felt, because we're immediately whisked away to action of some kind. In fact, it's not that there's a lot of action but rather many, many short scenes with some action in them. If you add that to shallow plot development, you get a mundane movie that should be anything but. The actors don't do the plot any favors, either; it feels as if they were selected because they were unknown, not in spite of it.I didn't have high hopes for the movie, although I did think it would be more like Jumper or Push, which shows you how little I anticipated Chronicle to begin with. But I saw it anyway.",Chronicle
43,dee.reid,"A great new twist on the superhero origin story, with a little bit of ""Akira"" (1988) thrown in for good measure - Seattle, Washington, is about to E-X-P-L-O-D-E...",8,16 May 2012,"It was once mentioned early in the 21st century (or maybe the late 20th century - I'm not sure) that comic book superhero movies represented one of the last places in film for truly original and innovative filmmaking. That was true circa-2000, but 12 years later superhero movies are a dime a dozen and have quickly become an over-produced genre upon themselves.Superhero movies have now become a trend, a fad, a cash-cow, in filmmaking, which is ironic considering that comic books have long been considered juvenile, mindless entertainment with little or no redeeming social or artistic value, and only now are people beginning to see that there is real artistic integrity and appreciation to be had in them. And only within the last 25 years has Hollywood begun to see the substantial dollar value attached to adapting comic books to the big screen.The superhero story is usually the same in every movie: guy/gal/group of folks gain superpowers, fight evil, the end; bring on the bigger-budgeted sequel. I don't mean to sound cynical, but that's only to illustrate what the genre has become.As a comic book reader and admirer of the superhero mythos, I find this both disturbing and distressing to see something that I admire so deeply quickly wear out its welcome. But, I do see some hope at the end of the darkened tunnel, especially with Josh Trank's 2012 hit ""Chronicle"" (with an inspired script co-authored by himself and Max Landis - son of ""National Lampoon's Animal House"" John Landis), a superhero-inspired movie that also manages to offer a new spin on the ""found footage"" genre of movies (which is also quickly becoming tiresome and predictable).Technically, it's not really ""found footage"" (like, ""The Blair Witch Project,"" ""Cloverfield"") because everything we see is actually part of a ""documentary"" being filmed ""live"" by the film's lead character, troubled Seattle teenager Andrew Detmer (Dane DeHaan), to videotape his day-to-day life after purchasing a $500 camcorder. Bullied and unpopular at school and verbally & physically abused on a regular basis by his alcoholic father at home, Andrew is a ticking time-bomb.Andrew's only real friend is his philosophical, socially-conscious cousin Matt Garetty (Alex Russell), who knows how to navigate the stratified social structures of high school. To help Andrew meet people, Matt invites him to a rave, but is thrown out of the party after a nasty altercation with a fellow party-goer. That's when Matt, along with popular jock Steve Montgomery (Michael B. Jordan), venture out into the woods, discover an underground cave, and later find a large - possibly extraterrestrial - crystalline structure that soon grants them with a large array of superhuman abilities such as telekinesis and flight.At first they use their newfound abilities to play harmless pranks on unsuspecting townspeople and their classmates, as well as improve their various lots in life. But soon things grow out of control when they come to embrace their dark sides, testing that ages-old adage that with ""great power, there must also come great responsibility."" More thoughtful viewers don't need to be told where such a story is likely to end up (think: the conclusion of any big-budget superhero movie, cross-bred with the second half of Katsuhiro Otomo's landmark 1988 Anime' ""Akira"").To get this out of the way, ""Chronicle"" is a film that grabbed me from the beginning. I started watching the film earlier today but because I had errands to run, it was difficult to tear myself away from the TV after 30 minutes in since the movie already had me firmly locked onto its story and characters. We really believe in the characters and that they're real people. Most importantly, we still believe that Andrew, Matt, and Steve are real human beings: the movie constantly reminds us that the three of them still exist in a world where they are still essentially seen as teenagers, teenagers with superpowers, not teenage superheroes.In doing so, we get to really relate to the characters, especially Andrew (Dane DeHaan turns in the film's most powerful and true-to-life performance). One of the benefits of the ""found footage"" genre is that we can always count on natural performances from the actors - something that I really believe to be true about ""Chronicle"" and Dane DeHaan's acting. Alex Russell and Michael B. Jordan also deliver brilliant performances. Their joy, and excitement, at their newfound powers becomes ours to live through vicariously, since, after all, if we ever got a vast array of superpowers like they do, these are many of the things we would do and these are how we would react to these superpowers.The ""found footage"" concept, I feel, added a new dimension to the well & worn superhero movie genre. It's a difficult thing to apply special effects and CGI to live footage in these movies, but what they did here was quite amazing; be honest, how many of us got a visceral thrill out of the vertiginous flying scenes? The only thing that really ruins ""Chronicle"" is its disappointing third act.I mentioned earlier that the movie turns dark around the one-hour mark and suddenly goes totally ""Akira"" on us. Thoughtful viewers will not find this the slightest bit unexpected, but I think it could have been handled better. During a great special effects-laden climatic third-act battle, we don't really get to see enough of the action to really comprehend the action & mayhem to care about what's happening to any of the characters. The ending wraps things up nicely, but it's still handled quite clumsily and could have been done better.And don't be surprised if we get a sequel in a few years.""Chronicle"" was a neat new twist on the superhero movie genre, a great new twist that shed light on a dying genre. I already know it's going to be a while before we see anything this original or innovative again.8/10",Chronicle
44,JoeB131,Better than I expected,6,14 June 2012,"This film uses the device of ""young kids YouTube every aspect of their lives"" to tell the story of three teens who gain super powers after encountering a mysterious object in a cave. They develop the ability to fly, move things with their minds and become invulnerable to bullets.Okay, to start with, they use the very tired convention that was started with ""The Blair Witch Project"", and continued with films like Cloverfield and Quarantine. Here it works a little better because they show the film comes from a number of sources, not just what the character themselves were filming.The film centers around the character of Drew, who has the alcoholic father and the dying mother.

45,drqshadow-reviews,"Crafty But Raw, Chronicle Needs Fine-Tuning",5,6 May 2014,"This awkward blend of several trendy genres has something to say, but can't quite work out the right way to say it. As the meeting point between superhero origin pictures, found footage compilations and moody coming-of-age stories, it arrives pre-loaded with all manner of tripmines and potholes, so numerous that it can't hope to avoid them all. It feels hokey and gimmicky, particularly when the action grows intense and the plot bends over backwards for an excuse to introduce more hand-held cameras. The cast interactions feel rushed and shallow, hurrying past crucial bits of character development to reach the precious prize of a shiny effects shot. And even those, presumably the film's sizzle, unanimously feel weak and clunky. Chronicle has a point, and the ruminations it embraces about the underbellies of each genre have loads of potential. It's just so poorly executed, nearly across the board, that it's tough to focus on what's going on beneath the hood. Excellent as a rough sketch or a proof of concept, flat as a finished product.",Chronicle
46,MBunge,"Well, that answers that question.",7,6 February 2012,"With Chronicle I've finally had to accept that no matter how good a movie is, I can't really enjoy it if it makes me physically ill. Whenever I try to watch one of these hand-held video, ""found footage"" flicks in the theater, I can only make it about 40 minutes in before the all the camera movement gives me a headache and light nausea. Which is frustrating in this case because this film is not just a good example of its particular genre of storytelling, it's a pretty good story by any standard. But just as it wound up to its emotional climax, I couldn't really get into it because I was trying to avoid climaxing my lunch onto the theater floor. So, if you're like me and prone to motion sickness from this kind of thing, you'll have the same problem. If you're free of that particular weakness, you might enjoy this motion picture a whole lot.On the surface, Chronicle is about three high school kids who crawl down into a hole one right and find something that gives them the power of mind over matter. When you look a little closer, though, it's actually a super-hero story. Except instead of focusing on a hero who learns ""with great power comes great responsibility"", this is all about the origin of the super-villain and what the hero learns is that the responsible thing is to NOT dress up in a costume and try to fight crime.The budding bad guy is Andrew Detmer (Dane DeHaan), an introverted high school loser with a dying mother and an abusive father. His cousin Matt Garetty (Alex Russell) is the sort of loner who thinks himself above the teenage experience and reads philosophy books to validate that feeling. The third, but in no way inessential, wheel is Steve Montgomery (Michael B. Jordan), the hot shot class president who's so normal, happy and well adjusted he doesn't have the slightest clue what to do with his power or the ambition to figure it out. The ""found footage"" of the story comes from the camera Andrew constantly keeps with him, though his eventual use of his power to manipulate the camera without touching it does give Chronicle a look that's quite different that other movies of this type. Now, you can't explain or rationalize any of it as some sort of documentary made from video recovered after events occurred, but it seems that convention of the genre is being dispensed with more and more as time goes on. I suppose that's good for the long term heath of the genre, but it's going to allow increasing implausible and hard to swallow storytelling.While there's a subplot involving Matt and a pretty young blogger (Ashley Hinshaw), the heart of this film is watching the moral disintegration that comes when you give incredible power to someone with the inner demons from a lifetime of social isolation and parental abuse. The lesson being that an unhappy person who becomes powerful doesn't become happy. They just get the ability to act out on their misery. And it is in that dynamic that the character of Steve is so important to the movie. While Andrew is a high school reject, Steve is the most popular guy in class and Chronicle embraces the reality that popular kids like Steve usually aren't douches or jerks. That's a stereotype propagated by writers, who were often the uncool kids in their class. Popular high school students are often no better or worse than anyone else, they're just more outgoing and socially capable than their geeky, withdrawn classmates. While the main relationship in the story is between Andrew and Matt, Steve is the lightning rod for Andrew's transformation into a bad guy and provides a moral clarity and structure to Andrew's predatory evolution.If you put Chronicle into the alternative super-hero genre, this is one of the best ones that's been made to date. If you classify it as a ""found footage"" flick, I'd only put it behind the verisimilitude of The Blair Witch Project and the inspired filmmaking of Video X. You should definitely watch itthat is, if you can keep a clear head and a calm stomach.",Chronicle
47,estebangonzalez10,Super powers used differently!,7,10 March 2012,"¨A lion does not feel guilty when it kills a gazelle, right? You do not feel guilty when you squash a fly... and I think that means something. I just think that really means something. ¨ During a time in Hollywood where we are constantly bombarded with superhero films, it felt fresh to see a different kind of movie in this genre. Here we actually are introduced to three characters who receive a special power (telekinesis), but instead of becoming superheroes they actually act like three young teenagers would really act if given this special ability. They begin to play pranks on other people, goof around, and have fun. They aren't interested in saving the world or putting on a cape in order to stop a dangerous villain. They just decide to have fun with their extraordinary powers. The story moves along nicely at a very interesting pace until we reach the third and final act which I didn't end up enjoying as much as the rest of the film. When one of the characters begins to abuse his special powers and decides to act revengefully, the film sort of goes over the top and that's when I began to lose interest. I think they just decided to go way over the top when unfortunately the movie was moving along at a great pace. I had a lot of fun with this movie and that is my only complaint. I'd give it a much higher grade if it weren't for that final act. I was really surprised with this movie since none of the actors are really known, but they do give believable performance. First time director, Josh Trank, who also wrote the story along with Max Landis, really proves himself with Chronicle, and he will be someone to look out for in the future. He managed to direct a very good action film with good visual effects on a very low budget, so he deserves a lot of credit for his work.The story centers around three high school kids from Seattle who seem to be leading normal lives. First we are introduced to Andrew (Dane DeHaan) who is the typical quiet kid who gets bullied on often, then there's his cousin Matt (Alex Russell) who drives him to school sometimes, but really doesn't hang out with him a lot since Andrew is so quiet most of the time. Finally there's Steve (Michael Jordan) who's the jock and sort of the celebrity of the school. He's actually a nice guy and dreams of becoming president someday. Matt convinces Andrew to come along with him to a party and during the party they encounter some strange object that has fallen deep into the ground. Steve, Matt, and Andrew decide to investigate by going down the hole and they finally find a sort of colored crystal rock. When they touch it, the crystal changes colors and blood begins running from their noses. The next day the kids discover that they have some sort of telekinetic ability and begin moving small objects with their mind. As they continue to experiment with their new found power they begin to grow stronger and find themselves moving bigger objects and even elevating themselves from the ground. The three grow really close to each other, and begin having fun with their ability by doing several pranks on people in a supermarket. The kids have a lot of fun at first, but soon they will discover that their ability can be dangerous as well if they don't learn to control their emotions.I think that the story is really well written and it does have an interesting and more realistic take on what would happen if a teenager stumbles upon a super power. The film does reflect on some of these issues, like how power can end up changing our lives if we don't learn how to handle it correctly. It also deals with another common issue that has to do with bullying and how this can severely damage people's emotions. I really enjoyed the take they had on this movie, but I wouldn't have gone as far as they did in the final act. I enjoyed the comedy of the first hour or so, but the last half hour was a bit of a stretch for me. Chronicle was filmed as if it were a documentary, a trend that began with The Blair Witch Project and has continued with other films like Paranormal Activity and Cloverfield. Chronicle actually feels at times like a J.J. Abrams film. This style of filmmaking may be distracting for some people, but I don't usually tend to have a problem with it. I do however think that this film, given its interesting story, would've been much better if filmed normally, without the hand-held shaky camera going on, because it did have a really interesting premise. I don't want to sound too picky though because I did enjoy this movie quite a bit. I just think it could have had the potential to be a five star film, but it's still a good watch.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",Chronicle
48,Fluke_Skywalker,With great power...,7,20 April 2015,"If your average kid were to suddenly gain ""super powers"", what would they do? Don a costume and fight evil? Not likely. They'd probably goof around, pull pranks and ultimately use it for some less than noble causes. But what if this real world Peter Parker didn't have the avuncular Ben Parker around to shape his moral code? Might he do something far, far worse? That's the very intriguing and well executed take of Chronicle, a quasi-super hero origin story that owes as much to 'Carrie' as it does 'Spider-Man'. Strong performances and some truly amazing F/X work highlight this impressive debut by Josh Trank, director of the upcoming 'Fantastic Four' and one of the proposed 'Star Wars' ""Anthology"" films. I would personally have preferred a more traditional narrative to the ""found footage"" gimmick, but Trank makes it work. I've had my doubts about Trank's 'F4' take since the start, but re-watching 'Chronicle' was a reminder that the guy is a real talent, and along with the new fairly strong 'F4' trailer, I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.",Chronicle

It has superior special effects, and they are used to enhance most scenes. I am not buying the three amigos thing, and particularly not buying the not enough money for the sick mother thing for sure. I mean really, If you can move things by thought, why not fly to Vegas (literally), and go to the craps tables. You could pay some older guy to throw the bones and get enough 7s and 11s or make the points to buy a hospital, not just the drugs you need for mom.

51,yusufpiskin,Blu-ray Extended Cut Version,8,14 November 2020,"One of the most stunning films in a genre that has clearly lacked originality for quite some time. Chronicle is an intriguing found footage film based entirely around three teens who discover an alien artifact that gives them telekinetic and psychic powers. The camera work is incredible and at no point does the film make you feel sick. Shakey cam is somewhat existent in this movie but it is no where close to the shakey cam in movies like michael bay's transformer films. The acting is incredible. Dane Dehaan Not only pulled off the emotionally traumatic and abused character well, he blew it out of the park. The movie is fast paced, original, entertaining, intriguing and challenging. The story beats flow nicely and the transitions are well done and feel seem less. For a choppy found footage film to still maintain the flow and fluidity of other movies in the genre really shows how talented the writing and directing teams were. Im so glad this film didn't fall victim to the American Sequel-ization of every successful form of media in the entertainment industry. Its a successful stand alone film and it wraps up cleanly. The movie starts and ends very strong while the middle content keeps the audience engaged. This film is a must see.",Chronicle
52,rooprect,Outstanding on so many levels,9,18 March 2015,"""Chronicle"" is a supernatural found-footage movie that.... Whoa, wait, where are you going?? Get back here! Oh I see you have a healthy distrust of the phrase ""found footage movie"", especially in conjunction with ""supernatural"". It probably brings to mind certain groundbreaking but nausea-inducing films like ""The Blair Witch Project"" and worse, many a low-lowbudget indie flick that uses ""found footage"" as an excuse for lazy camera work.Well, you'll be happy to know that none of that applies here. Initially very skeptical, I ended up really getting into the camcorder approach when I saw how expertly the camera work and special effects really are. Ultimately the cinematography of this found-footage flick ends up being more polished than most Hollywood blockbusters.""Chronicle"" is about 3 ordinary-to-nerdy high school students who stumble on a phenomenon that gives them supernatural powers. Immediately one thing I liked was the way the movie didn't waste any reels of film on trying to explain the backstory of this phenomenon. It was as if to say, ""Ok people, we're establishing that this is a supernatural story. But that's not the point so we're not going to waste time dwelling on it."" And immediately the story shifts to a very personal and psychological tale about 3 friends, their different personalities, the demons in their closets, and how the supernatural power brings out their latent, often ugly, human nature.The trailer, as well as the PG-13 rating, may lead you to believe that the story is somewhat tame if not flaky. There's no nudity, not too much profanity, and not much violence... whoa... Wait, actually there is a good bit of violence, but the camera doesn't dwell on it. Instead, even more disturbing I think, the camera gives you just enough to imagine the rest, and that can be pretty chilling. My nails were dug a good 3"" into the edge of my seat by the end. ""Chronicle"" begins at a leisurely pace but begins to pick up speed and tension up to its absolutely spectacular final minutes.I'm not just talking about the special effects which are quite convincing especially on a big screen if you have one. But the drama between the characters comes to an amazing climax, every bit as riveting as the visuals.""Chronicle"" is a great flick because it isn't stuck in any particular genre. It has elements of ""the Dark Knight"" and all those superhero type flicks, but it also has a firm basis in a solid teen-coming-of-age story with dark psychological overtones like ""The Squid and the Whale"" or an obscure favorite of mine ""Archie's Final Project"". It touches on the serious mind-damaging issues teens face in school like bullying, peer pressure to be cool, high school cliques, abusive parents, and (the whole point of the found-footage angle) society's withdrawal and depersonalization from itself through cameras and technology. This ain't no mindless action flick (although if you're just up for a good time, it can be taken as that), but this is a very critical study of the issues that many young people face. Couple that with super powers and you never know where it'll lead.Other great films about how humans behave when given absolute power include ""Sphere"" (1998) and the underrated gem ""Special"" (2006). Thumbs way up for all of these. ""Chronicle"" gets an extra thumb for featuring the David Bowie song ""Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars"" (an excellent metaphor). See it on a big screen blu-ray if you can.",Chronicle

The concept of three teenagers getting powers could go in a lot of different directions, so I thought it might be hard to explore all the possibilities in the length of one movie. By the end, I was satisfied. Three high school boys find a cave with glowing crystals, and the next day they begin developing powers. For a while, they just play around and pull pranks. However, one of the boys is picked on by classmates and abused by an alcoholic dad, and eventually turns his anger outward. He eventually becomes so dangerous, the other kid with powers has to turn on him to stop the rampage. It was a pretty epic finale. The found footage aspect of the film was its weakest part. I think that was because it was inconsistent. I enjoy the hand-held cam effect most of the time, usually because the films that employ them are well written enough that they would be good however they were done. In this movie, the effect distracts from the story. Especially since the scenes sometime look hand-held and sometimes look traditionally filmed. A fun watch.",Chronicle
56,TdSmth5,Tolerable and at times entertaining.,6,27 August 2012,"One day a loner kid whose mother is dying and his injured former-firefighter dad abuses him decides to film everything. That ostracizes him more from him peers because he runs around everywhere with some giant camera on this shoulder.After a party his philosophizing cousin and another friend ask him to film what they found- a large perfectly circular hole in the ground. They jump into it and follow along the cave to find some alien looking giant glowing mineral. Something happens and the the filming is interrupted.When the filming continues after some time we find them in the backyard controlling a baseball with their minds. Since the incident, they've developed telekinesis. At first with small objects, then larger ones, then themselves. They take their powers public bothering innocent people in stores and parking lots. Then they lean how to levitate and eventually fly.When the poor loner kid's mom is one the verge of dying, the kid puts on a protective suit and tries to rob a gas station to get meds for his mom. On his way out, the attendant shoots at him; an explosion ensues and the kid catches on fire. He ends up in the hospital. Even there, and after the mom's death, the father will blame him and try to abuse him. The kid loses it completely. Having realized he's an apex predator and that the strong destroy the weak, he's now ready to unleash his powers and destroy all who get in his way. It's left to his cousin to try and stop him.Chronicle overall has a good idea. It's entertaining to watch the kids develop and tame their powers and experimenting with them out there in the world. The filming is part POV, part third person because fortunately, the kid learns to control cameras and has them swarming around him. Thankfully, even when he has his old camera, the quality of the footage is excellent- unlike those poor bastards in horror movies who are forever condemned to film stuff in dismal quality grainy video. So at least that makes the POV stuff tolerable. But Chronicle retains the weaknesses of that kind of movie. It's boring at times, the portrayal of relationships overall is pretty poor- the relationship between the cousin and some girl is just awful, and eventually you end up with people just screaming at each other. Still, the entertaining aspects outweigh the negatives and this movie offers something we don't see often.",Chronicle
57,aidanratesmovies,Chronicle,10,20 May 2020,"Massively entertaining, endlessly interesting, and often awe-worthy- Chronicle is able to successfully break the mold of the superhero genre, by daring to do something different in the most unique way possible- and somehow succeeding. The main 3 cast members are all great, with Dane DeHaan and Michael B. Jordan deserving the most recognition from the cast. The film is also layered with some other good supporting performances, and a true brilliance of energy, shock, and humor that truly keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way through. Going into the film I expected very little. I've seen all of the MCU marvel films and all of the DCEU, as well as many other noteworthy superhero franchises, but none spoke to me on a level like Chronicle did. The film is so unique and so brilliantly crafted, it's incredibly hard to believe that the same man behind the camera on this film was the same guy that made the horrible Fan4stic Four remake. The film is directed, and written brilliantly, it's incredibly well paced, and despite its CGI not holding up SUPER well (no pun intended), the film is incredibly timeless. In the end, Chronicle is very brave with how it handles its material, and does it in a way that is both unique, refreshing, and cleverly entertaining. I have little to no bad things to say about the film, and hope to see films like it, and films learn from it in Hollywood in the future.

58,aharmas,Struggling with Super Powers,10,28 February 2012,"Superman had it easy in ""Smallville"" and facing the Joker was no big deal when you watch the ongoing development of acquiring super powers in ""Chronicle"", a refreshing take on what it means to have a sudden change in your physical and psychological nature.Three teenagers see their lives changed radically when they start manipulating the world around them. At first, there's a sense of confusion, some odd physical reactions, and plenty of disbelief. Of course, it helps that at least one of them is a bit different to begin with, and he has the most oppressive home environment. It's never quite explained, but every bit of their changes is recorded, so we can see the transitions, their joys, their ongoing conflicts, and the surprising conclusion. It's all thought out beautifully, with much attention paid to the personalities and the various events.We never forget who these people are, and most importantly, their age group. We see their interactions with other teens, their silly attempts at how they attempt to control their newly found powers. Some of the visual gags are immature and dumb. There are questions about what responsibility might come with their changes, and we get to see even how there are some unexpected developments as they learn how to fly. Interestingly, the writers don't make them immortal, and this is what helps you relate to the eventual conclusion.The film takes a different approach from the typical Hollywood blockbuster. We don't have easy answers to sudden changes in anyone's life. It's no more ""Ozzie and Harriet"" or ""The Brady Bunch"". Dreams are not so easy to achieve, and some of them might become nightmares.A film to be enjoyed, probably might even become a landmark on its own right because it dares to create magic, using every possible element in cinema: a solid script, decent acting, and a quite accomplished mix of technology.*****",Chronicle

60,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,Chronicle (2012),9,10 June 2012,"Mixing two of the most popular genres of the moment, found footage and superheroes, Chronicle has a lot of potential and actually lives up to it. 3 teenage boys discover something strange which eventually gives them telekinetic powers. One of these boys is Andrew, a bit of an oddball, he likes to record everything on film. He starts using his powers to gain popularity, but with a dying mother and an abusive father, it isn't long before his anger takes over. I love both these genres of films, so I was immediately taken in. However, I did feel the found footage gimmick was stretched slightly thin here. I think they should have done a District 9 and changed to conventional narrative means. The film is very entertaining at first. Imagine Jackass with superpowers. The boys have have so much fun exploring their powers and playing jokes, it's a side most superhero movies don't have time for.DeHaan gives a great performance and clearly captures his character's frustration and anger. He isn't simply a sniveling loser, but it's obvious to see that he has problems before the events of the film. As Andrew has the camera for the whole film, we see his side, which means as we approach the final confrontation, it's a weird feeling of relating more to the villain. The effects are stunning, and sit easily in the format. The flying scenes were simply beautiful, and completely blow away all previous cinematic flying. You could sense the calm and excitement of being among the clouds. The end had one of the most involving smackdowns of any superhero films.

As the film goes, Andrew starts abusing of his power and hurting people for no reason. Matt and Steve try to calm him down, but they never succeed. Acting is very good from the three main actors, with no exception. The whole story is VERY entertaining and interesting, probably helped by a strong directing and a beautiful photography directing.

Jordan is right behind him, alongside Alex Russell. It is almost literally just these 3 guys filming each other as they gain, experiment, and grow their supernatural abilities. There are some supporting cast, but they're more there as plot devices, and another camera angle. Found footage is not easy to do, which is why everyone complains about it.This is a very natural feeling movie with some dark aspects too it. I really think you can feel when the mood changes in this movie. It also brings up some great points on the ""reality"" of if people gained super powers.While most people would claim to be Captain America, the reality is that people tend to do whatever they can get away with, so creating a checks and balances with one's co-supernaturals makes sense, but the reality is enforcing that turns it into super ""hero"" versus super ""villain"".Surprisingly, this movie reminds a little bit of ""Hancock"", but probably not quite as good, mostly just different.If you like dark, edgy super power stuff or found footage, give it a go.",Chronicle

There is definitely ominous signs thrown in all over the place - probably too much foreshadowing actually. Anyway, pretty much from the get-go you can guess that things are not going to be nice and cheery to end the film. However, I greatly underestimated the magnitude of the explosion of aggression and violence that lit up the climax of this movie - quite jolting. It was pretty well done technically and the young men who starred (Dane Dehann, Alex Russell, and Michael Jordan) all did solid jobs for the movie. I especially liked Russell as the peace-maker, big-brother. Definitely worth a watch, and one of the better movies lately in early 2012.",Chronicle
64,brando647,Surprisingly Cool 'Found Footage' Film,8,26 August 2012,"I love a good comic book/superhero movie. They're my weakness, and I'm open to giving just about all of them a fair chance (for example, I paid to see RISE OF THE SILVER SURFER in theaters despite being well aware of how lame the first movie came out). While I am a massive fan of comic films, it doesn't mean that I'm blind to the fact that they have become a little formulaic in their execution. Whenever a new superhero is brought to the silver screen, regardless of how well it's done, you always sort of know what to expect. So I am incredibly supportive of any effort that tries to rattle the system a bit and attempt something different with one of my favorite genres. CHRONICLE is just that: a new spin on a popular genre. The characters in this movie aren't from any established comic book series; the story is completely original and written by Max Landis (son of director John Landis). Three teenagers in Seattle are exposed to some bizarre alien object buried in a field and soon find that they have developed telekinetic abilities. Andrew Detmer is your average socially awkward teenager, quietly coping with a terminally ill mother and an abusive alcoholic father. His closest ""friend"" is his philosophical cousin Matt and he fails to connect with any of his classmates, including captain of the football team/future class president Steve Montgomery. The three of them are brought together by their fantastic circumstances and start off using their powers for pranks and fun, but everything soon spirals out of control.CHRONICLE was Josh Trank's directorial debut. The man was only 27 when it was released, and it went on to gross $125 million. I don't care who you are, that's impressive. I dug this movie a lot more than I expected. The trailers had piqued my curiosity but the whole ""found footage"" angle has been so overplayed in recent years (sometimes well, sometimes not) that I wasn't in any rush. The entire movie plays out from the perspective of Andrew's personal video camera because his life is so miserable that he's decided to record it for whatever reason. Regardless, the format works out perfectly in the context of the movie. The movie is at an advantage not shared by other found footage movies in that it's character/cameraman uses his telekinesis to float the camera around, achieving angles that other movies of this format can't. It also had the good thinking to not limit itself to Andrew's personal camera, as they are many moments in the film cutting to other recording devices in the vicinity to capture the scene, whether it be a camera phone, a security camera, or internet video blogger Casey Letter (Ashley Hinshaw) who's only real purpose in the movie appears to be to act as a second viewpoint. The home video style has the added bonus of making the effects in the movie, impressive enough on their own, appear more authentic. When these friends are engaging in their pranks with their newfound powers, it looks legit.The movie stars a bunch of unknowns, of course, and it probably wouldn't have worked any other way. Fortunately, the non-stars in this movie have enough talent to come off as real high school students in a bizarre situation. Michael B. Jordan is charismatic as the football star, and Alex Russell does well enough as Matt, the voice of reason who decides one fateful afternoon that rules need to be set when things get a little out of control. But the real talent here is Dane DeHaan as Andrew Detmer, the true focal point of the movie. While all three of these kids received the powers, the story truly focuses on him. He's from a dysfunctional home with an abusive father, and he's never had any real friends to speak of. He's a walking joke at school, made even more awkward when he decides to start carrying his camera everywhere. He's a ticking time bomb and fate has just turned him into a weapon of mass destruction, with only a shred of self-control keeping him from going off. He's a vulnerable, lonely kid who finally feels like part of something and his eventual downfall when the pressure becomes too much feels sincere and you can't help but feel for the kid. And when he does finally meltdown, it pretty awesome. CHRONICLE was one of my surprise favorites at the start of 2012, so I'm glad I gave it go.",Chronicle
65,bob-rutzel-1,Pointless,4,25 May 2012,"Three high school students go into a cavernous hole and come out to discover they have super powers. Yes, somehow alien (UFO) technology is involved. I think the point of the story was supposed to be: Absolute power corrupts absolutely. And, maybe it was. As for me, I saw the movie as pointless. Remember the movie Jumper, which I also labeled as pointless? Hmmmm tough room. Anyway the same thing here. Okay, the students had fun with their powers on a small scale and even participated in a school talent show and did some amazing things. Then, as we knew it would, things got out of hand as their powers increased. And, we are presented with out-of-control kids, especially the angry one called Andrew (Dane DeHaan) who was always picked on by other students and whose home life is the catalyst for all that follows. One would think that when adults saw what was happening, particularly at the talent show, the kids would be corralled and asked to explain, but then that would be another movie. Hence, we are left with this show where no one noticed what was happening. The movie is watchable due to good acting and the CGI stunts are nothing but super fantastic. Kudos. However, people who have super powers are supposed to use their abilities for good. As a possible good Sci-Fi movie, this fails because we see a kid who is so out of control he cannot be saved; and the damage he does is mind boggling proving that absolute power does corrupt absolutely. Of course in Andrew's case, his anger helped fuel everything. We cringe as we watch things that should not happen.So what are we left with? Very good CGI entertainment, and very bad behavior that is not entertaining. As I said pointless. If you had super powers, how would you handle things? Huh?(4/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Only some soft stuff and not much of that.",Chronicle

""Yet another superhero-esque film"" I thought, this time brought to the screen with the increasingly hawkeyed hand-held style. Is this really necessary? Well no, its not, but its a lot of fun.The plot you can decipher from the trailer; three teenagers, Andrew, Steve and Matt find a hole in the ground and uncover something that gives them the power to move things with their minds. Then they act as any normal teenager would if suddenly given superpowers, they goof off. Things however get murky when Andrew (Dane DeHaan) begins lashing out as his broken family life becomes too much for him to bare. Actors Michael B. Jordan and Alex Russell complete the triptych as the local high school's popular kid and Andrew's too-cool-for-school cousin.Capturing teenage angst on film has always seemed like a real struggle for Hollywood. Common knowledge dictates that if you faced the camera towards a group of well groomed twenty-somethings and relegated them to a particular clique it'll all work out. Yet ""Chronicle's"" script expands on that world without making it ""the film"". Steve is popular because he is genuinely a sociable guy not because he's some feckless ladder climber. On the flip-side of the coin, Andrew is withdrawn and anti-social because his mother is ill and his father is an alcoholic with a rage problem. These are very real issues that are glossed over or ignored in average teen movies.But this isn't just a coming-of-age tale, its also a showcase for emerging talents, director Josh Trank and screenwriter Max Landis. While some of the camera tricks and dialogue may seem contrived at times there's no denying their boundless creativity. Trank breathes new life into the 'Blair Witch' gimmick taking ""footage"" from a wide array of hand-held gadgetry to create a pretty convincing collage, or dare I say chronicle.As the three climb into the hole to investigate one of them makes a reference to Plato's allegory of the cave. Perhaps a quote from 'Alice in Wonderland' would have been more apt.

I tend to go to all kinds of sci-fi movies, even if I think it's bad, because there's always something inspiring, even if it' s just a tiny little thing.Don't expect a high gloss picture, but something different. And don't expect the end to be as good as it promises. Still this is a promise of a great new filmmaker.In the beginning I actually though I had gone to the wrong movie. It was all like the start of ""Blair Which"", ""Cloverfield"" or ""The Trollhunter"" mixed with ""Kick Ass"". But the film evolved into an interesting and very different kind of movie.The acting of these, to me completely unknown, actors was brilliant. You really start to believe this is real handycam-stuff going on in Seattle. I think Dane DeHaan in the leading role is simply fantastic. His presence is actually reminding me of a very young Leonardo DiCaprio in ""This boys life"". Just like the boy there, this is a mistreated boy, lacking all confidence, with a violent and abusive father. DeHaan makes us as viewers suffer as we watch his fright and tears. His basic charm combined with acting talent will bring him far. I'd love to go watch the next film he's in, just because it's him (though every actor often needs a good director to shine).The synopsis to the movie sounds lame. And forget the lame trailer as well. This promises an annoying and rude highschool-comedy, probably to get hold of a big audience. I can promise the film is way better, and much more realistic. What's the best, is that we start caring and believing.I never felt so afraid for the main characters as half way through the movie, not to spoil the fun here. I almost felt sick with fear, like I was the father or brother of the boys exploring their newfound talent. When a film does this, especially as a surprise, then I'm all in!I really don't understand the title ""Chronicle"", cause I got thousands of other ideas for a name for this very different movie, but never mind.This is Kiss Ass without the humor, mixed with ""Cloverfield"" with a heart, mixed with wild sides of ""Paranormal Activity"", a part of ""Man on a ledge"" without the lines, mixed with ""Carrie"" and ""The Karate Kid"" with a dash of sci-fi, mixed with a dash of ""This boys life"", ""What's eating Gilbert Grape"", ""Trollhunter"" and even more - and this all made by a debut director, Josh Trank!Occasionally you see that this is a low budget movie, but this doesn't distract the story or absolutely the freshness of this movie.Go see a different movie, and use your brain the right way after wards!

The credit goes to Josh Trank and Max Landis because it's out and out their imagination and clever direction and story respectively which keeps us hooked to the chair. Casting is completely fresh so we don't have any pre conceived notions about the actors. Dane DeHaan is brilliant as misfit kid. Alex Russell is a charmer (I saw him in Aussie ""Wasted on Young"" before). Michael B. Jordan is alright, there is nothing much a black dude does in thrillers except getting hit first.

71,Screen_Blitz,"Exhilarating and gripping on its approach on the found-footage genre, Chronicle makes for an entertaining superhuman tale",9,25 August 2017,"Normally when it comes to the found-footage genre, the first concept that comes to mind is a horror tale centered on characters fighting against paranormal entities or demon incarnates. Director Josh Trank offers something unprecedented in the category, a story that answers the question of what would do you have if you were a high school teenager with superpowers. It is a story, caught on documentary- style footage, following the bonding and friendship of three friends put to the test when they are acquired with an uncanny gift that goes beyond what their imaginations. And for those nervous about the found- footage genre's common filthy habits of contorting the action with eye-straining shaky cam, fear no more as Josh Trank makes a generous effort on reducing this gimmick to a minimum. But that's much of the surprise compared to the gripping narrative heft that writer Max Landis manages to pack in this 83 minutes science-fiction thriller. This film, set in Seattle, follows 17-year old Andrew Detmer (played by Dane DeHaan), a lonely young man struggling with an unpleasant home life perpetrated by his alcoholic father (played by Michael Kelly) who slaps him around like garbage and his mother who is bed-ridden and dying of cancer. If that is not enough, he is also forced to deal with bullies at school and has no one to turn to but his cousin Matt (played by Alex Russell). During a night of partying and dancing, he, Matt, and popular fellow student Steve (played by Michael B. Jordan) sneak into some deserted where they are plunged into a dark hole inhabited by a mysterious crystal. Before they know, they are granted with eerie telekinetic powers. The story then follows their adventures as they explore their powers which soon turns into the nightmare when Andrew develops a dark side and becomes using his powers for sinister purposes. Some may argue that this is a superhero origin story as it follows the journey of three teens gaining superpowers. However, it is hard to considered this for the superhero genre based on its approach. That is not to say this film doesn't inhabit a few components of a superhero flick. There is a supervillain, but the villain lies not among the characters but within the psychological nature of the lead character Andrew as he progressively transforms from an innocent kid to an emotionally disturbed youngster with anger and frustration consuming him from inside out. The emotional nature of the young man is established by scenes showcasing the harrowing relationship with his abusive father The film maturely handles this concept in a way that not only allows for some steady character development, but opens the door to an tightly gripping climax towards the end where Andrew struggles to come to terms of his slowly deteriorating innocence. This is greatly pulled off by a sufficient, if slightly jarring tonal shift from the first half following the lives of the three characters as they toy with their new powers in goofy activities like flying around the city and pulling silly pranks at a toy store, to the second half revolving around Andrew's emotional transformation. However, partial credit should go to Dane DeHaan who puts on a stellar performance, channeling the psychological disturbance and emotional fortitude of his character. And kudos to Josh Trank for effectively capturing the action, particularly the final sequence in downtown Seattle, without resorting too far into the common gimmicks of smearing the action with redundant shaky cam and frenetic editing.Chronicle is an exhilarating incarnation of the found-footage genre filled with fun, energy, and gripping spectacle. Of course, the film is no gamechanger for found-footage flicks, a category of films that have gained notoriety for their creative bankruptcy and the unfavorable cinematography that has hindered the experience of many movies in that crowd. Nonetheless, it is a nice little treat of both teens and adults. So step onboard!",Chronicle
72,Troy_Campbell,A tremendous achievement in low-budget filmmaking.,9,3 February 2012,"The next in a long line of ""found footage"" flicks that have been flooding our cinemas over the last few years, Chronicle breaks free of the usual constraints within that sub genre to concoct a truly memorable sci-fi thriller. Retracing the steps of three teenage friends who are gifted with telekinesis after a chance encounter with something (intelligently, the movie never stipulates what exactly), the story focuses on the varying paths they take with their new found talent, but not until they have had some juvenile fun with it first. This is an amazingly accomplished debut feature for writer-director Josh Trank (who co-penned the script with Max ""son of John"" Landis); his technical veracity is utterly mind-blowing – especially when you consider the shoestring funds he had to work with – and his narrative pacing is impeccable. The icing on the already yummy cake is the marvellous CGI that allows our protagonists to fly, crush cars and stop baseballs in mid air – all seamlessly and photo-realistically. Chronicle is a tremendous achievement in low-budget, big-concept filmmaking.",Chronicle

Soon , they find life out of control as they embrace their darker side.Hand-held camera flicks are becoming common now days but this is completely different. It is a complete out-of-box thinking where final year college student's life changes after making an incredible discovery. This film reminds you of the great line from Spiderman flick ""With great power , comes great responsibility"". It makes you think about what will you do if you have been given supreme power. Will you use it for good purpose or will you misuse it to prepare your evil plan. Chronicle is directed by first time Josh Trank but the maturity with which he has handled the direction leaves a definite impression in your mind. Screenplay is tight and each scene holds your attention. The visual effects are mindblowing and fun to watch. The dialogues are crispy. Performance wise , I think it was Dane Dehaan who plays the role of Andrew. He was very good playing the character of an innocent-depressed boy turned into an evil sinister.Overall , very nice movie with good direction , storyline and amazing graphics.",Chronicle

How much can they get away with? This is all explored and played with quite brilliantly. The special effects on this one are quite awesome, with an ending that's both fun AND awesome.

75,Prashast_Singh,Amazing. Just amazing.,10,23 December 2020,"Chronicle is breath of fresh air when it comes to the originality it brings to the superhero film. It's short, fast-paced, action-packed and a relatable, grounded human story at core. As a kid, I myself imagined getting superpowers and being able to do all the flying and fighting: this youthful excitement is beautifully captured in Chronicle, due to which it's really fun to which. Although filmed in the found footage format, it's not a shaky/jarring visual experience; the camera itself becomes a character after a point of time and the innovations done with its handling are one of the many positives of this refreshing action film.Although it's reminiscent of the 1988 anime film Akira as the story progresses, Chronicle is fairly original and manages to be so much within the limited duration. It's also quite dark at times, touching themes like domestic violence and bullying without going overboard. By the time the action-packed climax arrives, you're fully able to understand the characters and what drives them to be what we see them as. Most superheroes are about what one should do upon getting superpowers, while Chronicle realistically portrays what one WOULD do, especially if they have a troubled life.The action sequences are fun and intense from time to time; the initial action portions focused on testing the power are pretty exciting, especially the flying scenes. Later, it grows intense and violent, and the effect is increased by the innovative use of various cameras. The visual effects are also pretty good for a tonally downbeat film like this. By the time it ended, I knew I was watching the right film. Chronicle is a fresh take on both the superhero film and the found footage film style at the same time. I knew it'd be fun before watching it, but I'd no idea how much it'd surpass those expectations. Strongly recommended.",Chronicle
76,TheUnknown837-1,"Josh Trank's ""Chronicle"" is the best, most clever mockumentary film this amateur critic has ever seen",9,6 February 2012,"Josh Trank's ""Chronicle"" is the best, most clever mockumentary film this amateur critic has ever seen. Walking into the picture knowing next to nothing about it, I did not expect it to follow in the tradition of ""The Blair Witch Project"" with every shot taking place from a hand-held camera and I must confess, that when I realized this was the perspective it was going to take, I started to groan, thinking I was going to have to suffer through another ""Cloverfield"" or ""The Last Exorcism."" So my reservations at the beginning only amplified my excitement at the end.Don't ask me why the movie is called ""Chronicle"" because I still am not sure, but here's the plot. Three friends (a popular sports star, a shy dweeb, and his cousin) are going through the rhythms of their lives when they discover a chasm in the middle of the forest. And being movie-teenagers, rather than summon the authorities, they go inside. Down in the chamber, they find (I think) a big blue crystalline object. The camera loses power. Cut to a new camera, and the kids have developed telekinetic powers. They can levitate objects, hurl things across the room, and fly like Superman.You'd expect the movie to become a buddy-film, with the three kids becoming crime-fighters, heroes of their local town. That is not the case. Instead, ""Chronicle"" which was smartly written by Max Landis, decides to delve for the authentic. The kids use their powers on impulses and whimsies, not sudden desire to be role models. For instance, in one of the movie's best scenes, they play pranks in a shopping mall, pushing carts away from people, and scaring the daylights out of a little girl by making the stuffed animals in the aisle float and dance in front of her. In another moment, one of them sets off a leaf-blower to lift a female classmate's skirt. By making these kids less of the typical do-goodies, they seem all the more believable. And the dialogue the three immensely-talented actors (Dane DeHaan, Michael B. Jordan, & Alex Russell) are given sounds so natural. It is the way young people talk. Mr. Landis makes good screen writing look easy.The movie is composed of recorded footage, but what makes it so terrific is the way it tinkers and plays around with that convention. It's inventive. One of the kids learns how to make his video camera float and move around, and this is so much more effective than the nauseating shots of ""Cloverfield"" and ""The Last Exorcism"" which were so fuzzy and out-of-focus that it became really annoying, really fast. In addition, the film does not stay with one camera in one unbroken shot the entire time. There are other cameras rolling, from other sources like cell phones, and security monitors. The filmmakers also utilize classic motifs such as establishing shots. For example, the story takes place in Seattle, but we don't figure it out until about ten minutes in, when we see the Space Needle through a windshield. But the very best usage of this cinematography is after the three characters have learned to fly, and are playing football in the clouds. My only wish is that this scene had contained them dropping the camera, and racing down to catch it before it hit the ground.Oh, well, I guess we cannot have everything.Effective as its cinematography is, I do wish ""Chronicle"" had gone for the traditional movie-making style, without everything being ""found footage."" Yes, the gimmick is used efficiently here, but it's still a technique I do have my reservations about. And although the sequences I admire, especially the flying parts, are spectacular, in hindsight, I kept wondering just how much more spectacular they would have been with normal film-making techniques. Also, Ashley Hinshaw gives a good performance in which is unfortunately a thankless, insignificant, and underdeveloped role as a love interest. She's first of all not on screen enough to justify her existence, and does little besides hold another camera and look pretty.2012 seems to have gotten a great start. Hopefully, Hollywood can redeem itself for the more-or-less debacle that was last year. ""Chronicle"" is certainly a step in the right direction. And after watching the film, I was all the more impressed to learn that its director, Josh Trank, has never made a movie before this one. Sometimes you can tell it's a director's first effort, but not in this case. As far as I was concerned, Mr. Trank was a pro with ten, twenty years of experience. He knows how to tell a story, even with gimmicks, and I look forward to his entire career.",Chronicle

""Red Tails"" Jordan. In a tale that riffs on ancient Greek admonitions about hubris and the Judeo-Christian equivalent, ""pride goeth before a fall,"" ""Chronicle""'s three high-schoolers discover a strange artifact that transforms them into superhumans (powerful telekinesis, flying, relative invulnerability). The results are eventually tragic, although the film ends on a note of hope and redemption. The trip along the way is refreshingly well done, an examination of the nature of the superman without the embarrassment of comic book adolescence. No spandex costumes, no crime-fighting, adventure-seeking nonsense, just a thoughtful examination of Lord Acton's famous adage, ""Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely,"" which he expanded upon thus, ""Great men are almost always bad men."" The ""found footage"" presentation makes it immediately accessible, especially since there's a notable dearth of shaky-cam so often associated with that conceit.I note with interest that the trinity of leads all have biblical names closely associated with the New Testament: Stephen (Steve) was an early Christian martyr, while Andrew and Matthew (Matt) were Apostles of Jesus. Coupled with Andrew's interest in Tibetan mysticism and Matt's eventual journey there, along with Andrew's dramatic arc akin to a male version of ""Carrie"" ramped up a few orders of magnitude, this can't be accidental. References to folks like Schopenhauer and Jung highlight Andrew's ultimate belief that he has become an ""apex predator,"" thus making the tragic finale all the more inevitable.Still, despite a satisfying close to the story (which I will not spoil), there's plenty of wiggle room for a sequel, and given that this brisk (running time less than 75 minutes by my DVD clock, not counting credits) sci-fantasy made a very handsome profit, I have little doubt there will be one. We can only hope that Landis gets to script it. Recommended.",Chronicle

An interesting variation on the now familiar 'Spider-Man' formula and other empowerment fantasies - what starts off deceptively appearing to be another story about a nerdy underdog triumphing over adversity by way of his mysterious new powers slowly turns into a horror film, much like Alfred Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" or perhaps even more so David Cronenberg's ""The Fly"", as the protagonist, Andrew, slowly turns into the antagonist, being both villain and victim by the end of the film. The hints aren't hard to spot - early on it is evident that his empathy for others is questionable at best, so you may not be completely surprised when he goes over to the dark side, but it's still a chilling sight to behold.",Chronicle
81,cultfilmfan,Chronicle,10,6 February 2012,"Chronicle is quite an interesting and thought provoking film that takes familiar elements that we have seen in other films and makes them feel new and original here. The basic premise is about three teenage friends who acquire telekinetic powers. At first they use these powers for fun and to play practical jokes and even to enhance their popularity at school. However like most teenagers the ones here deal with normal teen self esteem and angst issues and soon it may become dangerous if they decide to use these powers for evil and destruction rather than good. Chronicle is done using a hand held camera in most scenes and is supposed to have an almost documentary, or ""found footage"" type of feel to it like films such as The Blair With Project or The Last Exorcism. On the plus side, unlike such films as The Blair Witch Project, or Cloverfield, which I both saw in the theatre and both had very jumpy hand held camera sequences, this film did not make me feel queasy, or nauseated because of it, whereas the other two I mentioned did, so I thank the filmmakers for keeping it low key in that regard. I liked how the story of the film really reflected the different personalities of these three teenagers and didn't shy away from more mature subject matter as well. They do deal with loneliness, physical and verbal abuse and troubled home lives as well as trying to fit into school, but mostly being ignored, or ridiculed instead. Not all of them share these traits, but they are all unique and different in their own ways and very much similar to the type of people I remember going to school with, whether it be college, or high school. They like to have fun and be mischievous, or pull their pranks, but in their own way they are growing and maturing as well and in some of the darker and more serious scenes in the film, those characteristics come through strong. I felt that these characters were believable and I think any number of teen audiences who see the film should be able to at least connect, or relate to one, or maybe even all of them in different ways and that is another one of the film's great strengths. The film shows what it really feels like to be a teenager and it is not all fun and partying, but a lot of responsibility and at deeps can be overwhelming, troubling and one of the most difficult periods of one's life. The fact that this film did not shy away from these more realistic and personal scenes, I applaud the filmmakers for because it added depth and believability to the film. The film does deal with the telekinetic powers as I mentioned above, but I felt did it in a smart and original way. This is not your DC or Marvel comic book type of film. Those looking for that will be disappointed. The superpowers are more dealt with here on a moral type of reasoning and behaviour type of way. At first these powers are used for fun, but then it could become something a whole lot serious. It deals with the old saying ""With great power comes great responsibility"", but what if you do not have that responsibility, or are able to handle it? I like how the film threw us different angles of looking at this situation and by moralizing it and giving us something to think about afterwards. Also much to my delight the film did not overuse their special effects and instead of going overboard with them, or trying to show them off it uses them to enhance the story and the scenes in which they are required, but has no more, or no less and is not done to impress, brag, or be self indulgent. Something, I also really appreciated about this film. The film has an excellent pace to it and it does build a certain type of tension that I thought was built up quite nicely and worked very effectively. The film is also extremely captivating and entertaining and should draw most people in rather quickly. The style and direction of the film does as I mentioned take familiar elements from other films, but it really does make them it's own here and while some may have to get used to the style, I think most people will find that the filmmakers originality really pays off here. Here is a film by a very talented cast and crew who will definitely go on to do other big and great things. This film showcases their acting talents, the original and insightful screen writing as well as some good and tight direction that pulls it all together. I am very thankful that a major studio took a chance on a film like this because it was fantastic and I think the people who go to see it will find the same thing. This is the first 2012 movie I have seen so far this year and it's already one of my favourites of the year and I hope it keeps up it's box office momentum and my good review here adds to it's positive reviews and word of mouth.

As the meeting point between superhero origin pictures, found footage compilations and moody coming-of-age stories, it arrives pre-loaded with all manner of tripmines and potholes, so numerous that it can't hope to avoid them all. It feels hokey and gimmicky, particularly when the action grows intense and the plot bends over backwards for an excuse to introduce more handheld cameras. The cast interactions feel rushed and shallow, hurrying past crucial bits of character development to reach the precious prize of a shiny effects shot. And even those, presumably the film's sizzle, unanimously feel weak and clunky. Chronicle has a point, and the ruminations it embraces about the underbellies of each genre have loads of potential.

If you can imagine the outcome from a storyline so hedged in, you probably have a good idea what to expect from this movie.So I can't heartily recommend it. I know there's a subculture that fawns on CGI-dense movies... but I don't run with that sort... don't really know their expectations... so I'm not sure if I can recommend the flick to them.If you expect narrative richess from a flick, skip it.

This is nevertheless a very competent, well-told, mostly-sparing and surprisingly well-acted piece of work. While the special effects occasionally look creaky, this does not detract from the core issue here of an unlikely but growing and initially heartwarming friendship between likeable young characters played with considerable professionalism by Dane DeHaan, Alex Russell and Michael B. Jordan. The fact that the powers inevitably lead those who wield them astray (after initial pleasure and popularity) leaves the film edgy from almost the outset, and the second fact that DeHaan's character Andrew Detmer is so much worse off (in several ways) than his colleagues does not provide the kind of ""we need to forgive him under the circumstances"" leeway you might anticipate. He's one of life's victims, he's suffered quite a bit, but that does not let him off the hook, and this is actually quite a tangibly tough message.Given that none of us are likely to encounter an alien source dispensing this kind of special force any time soon, we are entitled to ask why a film such as ""Chronicle"" should be made at all - or watched.

87,johnstonjames,A Chronicle Of The Power Of Youth,7,4 June 2012,"more than anything ""sci-fi"", i really thought this film played basically as a metaphor for youth. it's message was clear and simple, youth is a time of energized power and ability, but also can be a time, if not channeled properly, of energized destruction and negativity.often times young people, like the teenagers in this movie, don't know or fully understand the power of their own strengths, and without any conscious insight, can wreak much harm and havoc and sometimes, destroy themselves. we see it all the time in young people and most can remember what a volatile and troubled time we had adjusting while we were young. some of our generations never even make it to a ripe old age or even middle age for that matter. others are often capable of amazing things that sometimes revolutionize our world.i really enjoyed the story, script and timely metaphor here, but i admit i didn't care too much for the film's ""video footage"" approach. there are times when the ""documentary"", ""video footage"" approach can still be milked and used effectively, but not always and not here. this time the whole ""video footage"" approach seemed clichéd and unnecessary. this film would've worked much better and more effectively without it, had it been given the usual dramatic approach that most Hollywood films still employ in their narrative. i would have appreciated this film even more if it hadn't been a ""video footage"" narrative.but it did manage to have some good action moments and some good CGI FX. and the plot was developed in a timely manner.most of all this was a good film about being young. the protagonist were, after all, only kids. i mean like one of the teenage boys still had a old toy box filled with his old 'Lego' building pieces which the boys played with.it is also a film about the powers you have when you are young. when you are young you are often more energetic and vitalized more than older persons who become more set in their ways and demand more quiet and peace of mind. but just as youth holds the power for dynamic ability and change, that power can also be channeled into negativity and destructive tendencies if unchecked with everyday realities and responsibilities.",Chronicle

We know little to nothing about them at the beginning of the story, and we learn nothing more as the story moves along.There isn't enough interaction with other people, and when we do see this, we get nothing more than silly pranks.The effects were sub-par, and the movie didn't really hash out any specifics on the mortality of the characters.Which brings me to my biggest gripe which is; what is the point? There is no moral here, there is no story here, there is no ending here, there is no connection with the central characters. I cannot think of one character that was likable, not one, and to top it all off, the whole movie seemed extremely unrealistic in how it unfolded.

Andrew Detmer played by (Dane DeHaan), Steve Montgomery (Michael B. Jordan) and Matt Garetty (Alex Russell). The three discover something not of this world buried deep in a cave that gives them superpowers. At first their powers are weak and are a burden to use leaving them with bad nose bleeds.

Soon the full potential of their powers get them into trouble and it isn't long before one of the three develops a bit of a god complex and begins becoming more and more unstable.The main issue I have with this movie is that it's filmed like a found footage movie meaning it's shot almost entirely in POV (Point of View). These kinds of movies always give me a headache and make feel nauseous due to the shakey camera movement and constant change in focus. I will however say that Chronicle is one of the better movies to be filmed in POV the camera work is far better than in other found footage movies like (The Blair Witch Project) (1999) and even big budget movies like (Cloverfield) (2008).One of the other issues I have with Chronicle is that the movie focuses more on the characters doing juvenile things with their powers than it does on action and storytelling. I appreciate the characters being written as more down to earth doing juvenile things with their powers like any person would if they suddenly had a powers. The problem is that a good chunk of the movie focuses on the three main characters playing pranks on people and doing stupid things with their new powers. Theres only so many times you can laugh at the same joke over and over again before you get bored of it and you want to see some action on screen.The last twenty minutes of the movie is where all the action happens and I will admit the special effects and camera work even in POV looks amazing. There are some really cool looking shots of the characters crashing into buildings and statues during the movies climax. I was impressed with how much they managed to accomplish with the budget they had for the movie.I would definitely recommend watching Chronicle if you're a fan of superhero movies and TV shows. The movie can be a little silly at times with it's juvenile prank humour but overall Chronicle is entertaining and enjoyable.",Chronicle
93,qormi,Good - Watch it.,10,19 August 2012,"The twenty-something teens seemed authentic - they actually acted like teenagers - a rarity. The use of the camcorder - sort of a candid chronicle of what's happening - went over very well. The emergence of their superpowers and their mastery of it fit into the teenage reactions you would expect. I think it was an intelligent film - it made you think and it seemed real. When one of the teens, who had a traumatic home life, begins to unravel, everything accelerates into a tragedy. It was genuinely scary because it seemed so natural. Every single one of the characters seemed authentic and I believe this film achieved groundbreaking realism in that regard. It's one of those movies that holds your interest and makes you cringe. It drags you into it....when everything spins out of control, it retains its edge....it's genuinely terrifying.",Chronicle
94,griffolyon12,A Surprisingly Thoughtful Found Footage Flick,8,3 December 2012,"I am generally not a fan of found footage movies. From Blair Witch Project to Cloverfield, I've never really felt that these films had much to say. They were gimmicks used to get cheap thrills, or to tell a conventional story that has nothing else going for it than the found footage angle, but what Chronicle does, is that it not only plays on the superhero genre, but it also works as a fascinating expose on modern teenage culture.The premise is simple, a teenage outcast takes to videotaping his life, then one night him and two other guys travel into a mysterious cave, and when they emerge they all have telekinetic powers. The film then doesn't bother itself with being a superhero film, but rather a realistic exploration of what would more than likely actually happen if teenagers got super powers in real life. Well, they'd abuse them of course.Actor Dane Dehaan is the thread that holds the whole movie together, as outcast teen, Andrew, filming his whole life. By choosing to do the found footage approach, it shortchanges all of the other characters, but makes Andrew's character all the stronger, and it actually portrays an outcast's turn to violence, with more clarity than films without the fantastical elements. In a world such as the one we live in, it's surprising to find a film that is so socially minded, wrapped up in a film that will appeal to the crowd that most needs to see this cautionary tale. While it isn't perfect, or by any means all that rewatchable, it's a genuine surprise that is worth seeing.I give Chronicle an 8 out of 10!",Chronicle
95,Laakbaar,Teenagers suddenly get super powers,8,18 April 2012,"This is a movie that competently takes the viewer (once again) into the world of a small town American high school. The focus is on two cousins: older and cooler Matt (played by the attractive Alex Russell) and troubled Andrew (played by Dane DeHaan). One more joins the group: popular Steve (played by Michael Jordan).A strange event occurs that gives the three special powers, specifically telekinesis and flight. Later they also seem to have super strength and at least some invulnerability. A fun part of the movie is exploring what American teenagers would do if gifted with such extraordinary powers. This is nicely portrayed and the viewer is drawn into the excitement. The flying sequences in particular were fun to watch.At the start, the story is primarily told from Andrew's point of view, literally, because Andrew is into filming and the story takes the form of found footage. We see the world through Andrew's eyes, so we come to understand his life and his motives. However, because of his family life and emotional problems, Andrew ends up having difficulty coping with his powers. This problem becomes the focus of the last third of the movie. Will Super Andrew, our narrator, be able to find his way?",Chronicle
96,billygoat1071,"Great Power, No Responsibility",8,9 February 2012,"Chronicle is not really a superhero movie. It uses its themes but none of the characters are using their powers for virtues and justice. It's all fun and games until they get into trouble. It's a great idea but it could have been filmed in a regular filmmaking style. The hand-held camera fails to make the film credible. Despite from that, the film tells a great story with a great twist. The actors are fun. The CGI is good enough. The film is short and small but it's undeniably exciting and really compelling than any other big blockbuster films we usually get.Chronicle abandons the clichés of superhero films. Usually, when they discovered their powers, they use it to save someone and make their own costume and save the day. The movie asks, what will happen if teenagers in real life have superpowers? In this film, the kids are just recording themselves having fun with their powers. And one of them will use it more for revenge than saving the day. It's a clever idea.It could have been filmed in a regular movie camera. The found-footage style is pretty unnecessary. The film doesn't need that to look credible. Also, there are too many random cameras and angles which is kind of awkward. Though, the shot was pretty good. But it's still unnecessary. The CGI works better in large objects. It looks dated when comes to the small ones like the spider and the legos. Dane DeHaan, Alex Russell, and Michael B. Jordan are all fun together. It gets better in the third act. Dane DeHaan gives a great rage to Andrew. The climax is awesomely fun.Chronicle may be short and small but it feels long and bigger. If only the film was shot in a regular style. But it still makes a great movie. The concept is great. It's fun, intense, and compelling enough to enjoy it in the big screen.",Chronicle
97,TheSquiss,I've been trying to fly ever since watching it.,8,16 June 2012,"Chronicle doesn't have many selling points on paper: Feature directorial debut of Josh Trank, a cast of virtual unknowns and a light plot that deals with three friends who find something down a hole that gives them powers. The most obvious selling point is that writer Max Landis is the son of John and there's always the hope that some Blues Brothers (the original, not the travesty of 2000) magic has rubbed off on him.That was before I watched the trailer. Too much was shown for my liking, but that's a regular gripe and I'll deal with it properly another time. What we see is three friends hurling trucks from roads, cops and cars being thrown across car parks and enough drama to make a ticket purchase essential.But there's more to Chronicle than CGI effects, which are largely superb, and superheroism. It makes the fantastic seem credible and the possibility of such events occurring almost tangible and definitely desirable! The fad of 'lost footage' films kick-started with 1999's Blair Witch Project and has evolved over the years through some real dross and the occasional gem like Cloverfield and Rec, yet Trank manages to bring something original to the sub-genre.With such films there are limits, not least of all because we're not able to see the character holding the camera unless the director breaks the rules. Not so with Chronicle. The protagonists' new found powers of telekinesis open the film up to completely satisfy the viewer without leaving us feeling cheated. It's a great device that works perfectly. Trank also brings a genuine sense of reality to the film both in shooting style and content. Let's face it, if you suddenly found you could move objects or fly, would you suddenly don a spandex costume and fight crime or would you start by freaking out customers in shops or playing football in the air? There's an edge to the film, there's a moralistic element and one can understand why it all goes wrong for Andrew, the geek with the camera. I'm not saying we'd all go around slinging buses through buildings if we could but we've all had the urge to throw something at someone and buses are a small step away from that. Well, they are if you're in Chronicle.This is absolutely not a superhero film, no matter what you've heard. It's a film about emotions, friendship and coming to terms with what life throws at you. And we've all been there with our teenage years. More than anything, though, Chronicle is great fun and I've been trying to fly ever since.Another film review from The Squiss.

98,osj2507,I think this has some qualities,6,12 September 2015,"I am not particular for the hand-held camera experience, but after a while it actually works very well for this movie, it makes it seem a bit more realistic and maybe even like a ""real"" super hero footage kind of thing :)Andrew Detmer played by Dane DeHaan is a very special character, he is not popular and maybe most looked upon as a nerd or even a freak, he clearly haven't read a lot of stories about super heroes, at least he doesn't think he has any responsibility, but thinks only power comes with his new found abilities.It is interesting to watch, but becomes a bit too much and maybe to serious, the first part where they discover their abilities and develop them are great, but it becomes very dark and revengeful.

100,dfle3,Black trench coat fantasy...as filtered by Hollywood. 65%,6,29 February 2012,"I saw this movie because it had gotten some good reviews...but mainly because a specially 'loyalty' reward (cheap ticket) was about to expire on my cinema chain card.The overriding response this movie got from me was one of how silly it all seems to be...which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but which, on reflection, made me drop my score from 67.5% to 65% (and hence one less mark out of ten).Storywise, this is a tale or origins...how a group of teenagers came to have extraordinary powers. It's told through the narrative device of self-filmed story...that's hand-held cameras. Even though I think the last movie I saw this device used was The Blair Witch Project, I still felt that it was 'too soon' to see it again! In any case, I don't see why this kind of story needs the simulation of 'realism' to confer something on it. All it does - early on, especially - is give the movie the sense of being a boring, self-indulgent homemade video.So, the movie does start off slowly, establishing character before these characters are transformed...rather predictably, truth be told...I was aware of some reviews mentioning this movie having good and bad characters...not much of an effort guessing who would turn bad.In favour of the movie is the humour in the establishing part of the narrative. As these three, male teenagers come to grips with their powers, there is comedy as they learn by trial and error.The biggest plus to this movie is that - unlike in a TV show like ""Heroes"" - you don't have to invest that much time in it. It's over quickly. No brain popcorn entertainment. I suppose it's possible that there could be a sequel, but really, once is enough for me.If you enjoyed shows like ""Heroes"", ""The 4400"" or movies like ""Spider-man"", you could enjoy this.

This film is absolutely trippy. I really enjoyed the humor and was convinced this is the way high school kids would act if they suddenly gained superpowers. This isn't a superhero film though. On the contrary, the kids just enjoy themselves, showing off, freaking a little girl out in the store by making a stuffed bear float and dance, flying through the clouds just for the heck of it. And then things get dark when one of them out of anger swipes a tailgating truck off the road with a mere wave of his hand, nearly killing someone. That's all the spoilers all give.

You really get into the mood of those guys goofing around, it's crazy. DeHaan, who played the troubled kid, is even excellent. Nice ending.The bad. At some point, the hand-held camera premise got a bit constrictive and they had to find an other camera totting character, the blogger. That was one too many, and you loose the intimate feeling of the group.The ugly. When they couldn't keep the hand-held camera premise anymore, they shifted to include CC camera.

105,johnnymacbest,"Despite it's short length, I really enjoyed Chronicle.",8,12 February 2012,"Throughout the years, audiences have been treated to origin stories such as those based on superheroes. With the recent success of the Batman, X-Men, Spider-Man films; and also worth mentioning ""Thor"" ""X-Men:First Class"", and ""Captain America"", it's not hard to see why they click with audiences. With ""Chronicle"", the superhero origin story is given a fresh new spin.Directed by Joe Trank, ""Chronicle"" tells the story of three friends who gain superpowers from a mysterious tunnel discovered in a remote part of a suburban town. Strangely, these teens don't seem frightened or confused about their new found power. Think about how frightened and confused Bruce Banner was when he first transformed into the Hulk. But whereas Hulk was bombarded with gamma rays, ""Chronicle"" takes a swipe at a fairly plausible Dues Ex Machina plot device that has yet to be explained in possible future installments.It's true that some may find fault with it's vignette-style story telling in the vein of ""Cloverfield"". But unlike ""Cloverfield"" which was a good film in it's own right but had a little too much ""shaky-cam"" effect, the technique is surprisingly easy to follow. That along with the well-written script and performances, made ""Chronicle"" all the more enjoyable and engrossing. Maybe in the future, film-makers should take notice from this film in order to make a superb product. Not only that, they even managed to achieve believable special effects on a low budget along with the script. That's really impressive that they achieved to reach fans of superhero comics and films as well as the general audience; very unique.But I really wished it was longer. With such an intriguing premise even more better than Hayden Christensen's stinker of a superhero origin story ""Jumper"". ""Jumper"" was such a disappointment. It wasn't even fully developed on it's potential and sadly was utterly wasted. Thankfully, ""Chronicle"" delivers on everything that film didn't and more. The climax(which I will not spoil) is one of sheer awesomeness. Emotionally charged with a nice dash of good vs evil, done in an unconventional way. The length of the film bummed me out, but from the looks of things, I can see this film grow into something really special.",Chronicle
106,kdnor2011,A great Supervillian origin story,9,20 May 2012,"Chronicle is a different type of found footage movie. Most found footage movies are horror, but I guess since superhero movies are so popular right now, we should have expected a found footage super hero flick. And while The Devil Inside was a boring train wreck of a found footage movie, Chronicle gets almost everything right.Let's just get the stuff I didn't like out of the way. The special effects range from OK, to bad. Most of the time they looked descent but nothing ground breaking, but a few times they just looked so fake. Also the lead girl (Matt's girlfriend) seemed completely pointless. I can't even remember her name, she was there, just so they could have another camera.Other than that, this movie was great, and for a while was my favorite movie of the year until The Avenger took over. I really liked the characters, the three main guys were all likable, played by great actors, and very funny. The premise is great, think about it, if you got super powers, you wouldn't use them to fight crime, at least not at first, you would have fun with them. I love how they use telekinesis (I doubt I spelled that right,) to fly, it seems so obvious now, why haven't we used this in movies before. The found footage gimmick is used very well here, using dozens of camera throughout Seattle. I don't know who edited this together, but he had to find quite a lot of cameras.Normally I'm not a fan of superhero origin stories, but this is more of a supervillian story. The relationship between Andrew and his dad is very well done. I HATED his dad, he was a horrible person, and I can totally understand why Andrew went the way he did.Chronicle is one of the best films of the year so far, and one of the best found footage movies out there.8.5/10",Chronicle

Yes, there are sections where his cousin Matt takes over and Matt's girlfriend Casey Letter (Ashley Hinshaw) also has some camera time, but I found it all a little one- dimensional. As far as performances go, well everyone did a pretty good job with Alex Russell just about standing out for me. Although I found the contrivances used to get this 'found footage' style film up on the screen a big distraction it did have a one good thing in its favour. I did like the special effects when things are kept up close and personal. As soon as it became much bigger as in the big fight scene at the end; I'm afraid it all got a little too 'Transformers' for me. Over all, I found little likable about any of the characters; particularly Andrew (although he does have a fine name); and this was enough to put me off. After all, if you can't identify with the characters then the filmmakers have lost half the battle.

109,nickmesafilms,Chronicle (2012) - Supernatural Powers Are Caught on Camera! Awesome!,10,6 June 2012,"Presented with the look and style of a ""found footage"" motion picture, filmed as if the characters are filming the events with a recording device that they carry around with, ""Chronicle"" is a ridiculously entertaining motion picture that's definitely worth the price of admission. The film follows the story of three teenagers who end up getting supernatural powers of mind control and levitation, after discovering a mysterious object from underground. ""Chronicle"" delivers a unique version of how one receives supernatural abilities, and how they must learn to control it. That's a perfect example of what this movie brings. These three kids have decided to use these powers to prank strangers, make magic tricks, and use it for personal life problems. But the phrase, ""with great power, comes great responsibility"", is still recognized as a fact. One of the teenagers, who has been abused by his stepfather, been bullied at his school, and his mom is close to dying, has gone obsessed with his powers, and it allows him to use them, more for darker issues, from making others feel tortured and feel pain, separating himself from other people. This will cause some conflict and destruction near the final act. ""Chronicle"" is probably one of the best movies of the year, by far. From beginning to end, this is an immensely enjoyable motion picture, that redefines the genres of both supernatural power and found footage genres. I love how this movie makes fun of the fact that this is a found-footage movie, since the main character takes the camera everywhere he goes, and doesn't want to get rid of it. The unique style of cinematography is brilliantly executed, perfectly capturing a real-life style and look to the movie. The visual effects are undeniably groundbreaking, some of the best effects that I've seen in a while. All of the characters absolutely shine, delivering such realistic and conflicting performances that accurately show the real-life adventures of a high school senior. I was remarkably impressed by this movie, and I can go on and on, but I think I've made my point. But I was definitely impressed on what this movie wanted to be. Director Josh Trank perfectly makes a film that perfectly shows the realism of a teenager's life, through the lens of a camera, and how having superpowers can show their complete anger and pain. ""Chronicle"" is a powerful, and thought-provoking motion picture that will test your emotions, and show who a human being really is.

110,Ramascreen,Super Cool!,8,2 February 2012,"I've got two words for CHRONICLE: Super Cool! What a fantastic film! So  much fun! The three characters on the screen havin' a blast with their  superpowers and we the audience get to have a blast with them,  CHRONICLE is that engaging! I'm not too crazy about found footage or  POV genre but writer Max Landis and director Josh Trank have crafted  something that allows not just the character's camera but every other  freakin' camera that's around, to help tell the story. And I admire the  fact that the film doesn't shy away from the usual adolescent problems,  it's pretty much a relatable teen movie but it's also got awesome  superpowers..  When I watched the previews and trailers, I thought I was in for some  kind of wanna be X-Men but minus the costume and minus a mentor ala  Xavier, but CHRONICLE is nowhere near that comparison at all. The two  powers presented in this film are telekinesis, which is moving objects  with your mind, and flying, one of the top most coveted powers ever,  who the hell wouldn't want to fly?!  Of the three key characters, I think it's fair to say that Andrew (Dane  DeHaan) is the lead. His story, his personal dilemma, becomes the  motivating factor for the epic conflict that awaits in the third act.  Matt (Alex Russell) is his cousin and Steve (Michael B. Jordan) is the  popular jock. In a normal world, there's no way that these three  could've been friends, not in another lifetime either, but as soon as  they gain superpowers, there's a bond, a friendship created, it's as if  they've formed their own fraternity that only they could play in.  If you're a teen and you suddenly find that you could fly and move  objects without touching them, saving people or being a hero would not  be the first thing that comes to your mind, that's just the honest  truth and that's why CHRONICLE is fun because it shows what any normal  teen would do if they're granted superpowers beyond their imagination.  They'd pull pranks, they'd use it to see girls' underwear and the list  goes on, they'd even play football 30,000 feet above ground. The flying  sequences are my favorite because they're absolutely thrilling. The VFX  is impressive for something that's not a summer big budget type film.  And as I mentioned earlier, what CHRONICLE does is tell the story from  the perspective of more than just Andrew's camera. Especially the big  fight scene at the end, you get to see it through traffic cameras,  helicopter cameras, building security cameras, and regular folks'  handycam. And because the character Andrew is supposedly skilled at  handling cameras, what you get is a more steady, less dizzying  presentation as opposed to other found footage films like Cloverfield  for example. Any teen with problems at home could relate to the  frustrations that Andrew, Matt, and Steve feel. None of their problems  are far-fetched, their powers may be, but their problems aren't. Taking  it out on the world,.. not being there when you're needed the most,..  those kinds and more make CHRONICLE a grounded, unique film.",Chronicle
111,dvc5159,Boys will be boys indeed,7,7 February 2012,"Josh Trank's ""Chronicle"" comes at a time where ""found footage"" movies are all too common and gimmicky. Hot on the heels of ""The Blair Witch Project"", ""Cloverfield"" and ""Paranormal Activity"" (all of which are scary films), big movie studios are wringing this concept dry in order to save huge costs and make millions worldwide. Of course, the public soon grew tired of the ""fake documentary"" style and excessive ""realistic"" shaky camera as a result.""Chronicle"" isn't a horror movie, however. I'd like to think of it as a superhero origin film without the usual glorified stuff, sort of like M. Night Shyamalan's ""Unbreakable"" but with more youthful angst. At first glance it could be called a comedy, and soon after the midpoint that's where things go dark. After a mysterious discovery three teens suddenly develop superpowers which they decide to use for fun. You got Andrew the anti-social loner who constantly faces sh*t every day at home and at high school, his cousin Matt who uses philosophy to justify his own loneliness, and the popular and well to do high school jock Steve who wants to help Andrew get lucky. All three use their powers for pranks and flying and other fun stuff (if one of them was Peter Parker, Uncle Ben would be rolling in his grave) until Andrew accidentally injures someone with his powers out of anger. Youthful rage, indeed. Telekinesis is no worse than a gun or a knife when placed in the wrong, and especially angry, hands.From these three main characters the foundation is set for character development and conflict. The home footage, like all ""found footage"" films, definitely gives the dramatic scenes some punch, specifically with Andrew the unlucky one. The film is mostly seen from his point of view so we understand his motive as his new-found powers being to chip away his withdrawn exterior and he begins to lash out at everyone who opposes him. It is villainous, but it isn't evil, it's just tragic. Brian De Palma's ""Carrie"" comes to mind, except less bloody and on a more destructive scale (still around the PG-13 limit). The audience is treated to a ticking time bomb of a character while the other two try to reason with him, inevitably leading to a violent and tragic confrontation. A real hero and villain face-off. Trank and fellow writer Max Landis (son of fellow filmmaker John Landis) succeeded with the character development here, we are not so intimidated by Andrew as we do feeling sympathetic for him. The writers do not care about the origins of their powers as they do with the emotional effects it will have on the three characters. Dane DeHaan, Alex Russell and Michael B. Jordan, the three main actors, are all new to me, but they give very convincing and entertaining performances, especially DeHaan who looks like he can have a rich career ahead of him.Trank directs the film briskly and confidently. The editing doesn't feel forced, and the various camera formats (home video, CCTV) spliced together gives a raw atmosphere throughout the film (a staple of ""found footage"" films) which makes for a more interesting and exciting watch, specifically during the climax where Seattle comes under attack by Andrew's rage in scenes reminiscent of Katushiro Otomo's ""Akira"" (I doubt Jaume Collet-Serra will be as good as Trank in making his remake as engaging as this scene alone).The special effects crew, given the budget, manage to make the destruction and the mayhem feel threatening and not just exciting. The camera work was nicely done as well as it wasn't as aggressively shaky as expected from this type of film, we even manage to view the action in its fury during the climax. It's clear Trank wasn't going for the ""woah"" feeling and instead was aiming for the gut. Not bad for a first feature film.Despite some clichéd moments and a few plot holes, ""Chronicle"" stands on its own right as simply a solid, good film, not just a light surprise in the ""found footage"" department. It is a real movie, with interesting, fleshed out characters and a coherent, fluid story structure, instead of being just another ""remnant of whatever happened"". I wouldn't mind seeing it a second time, but I'll probably wait for the DVD/Blu-ray rental. Oh, and I hope those teens who watch this movie will at least stop bullying whoever they are bullying. They'll never know until its too late. Poor Andrew.Overall: 73%",Chronicle
112,Sanpaco13,"Interesting take on ""super powers""",9,26 March 2012,"From a certain perspective, this is just another super hero movie where the hero and the villain start as friends and become enemies. For me this had a lot more levels than that. I enjoyed the first person mode of filming because it made the characters seems more real to me rather than being actors. It helped me to really identify with each of them instead of classifying any of them as either good or bad. Andrew and Matt's relationship is a truly interesting one where Andrew is truly the more likable of the two, but as they begin to progress more and react to the power they get from their new abilities, Matt is the one who is more level headed and Andrew begins to go off the deep end. I think for me what really made this film entertaining was the lack of superhero tights or nicknames or even alter-egos.

""Chronicle"" aptly portrays adolescent/high school existence, an age that so many films screw up with clichés and stereotypes. Very true-to-life dialogue: Whoever wrote the script did an outstanding job. All the Greek morality play elements, the theme of hubris, etc, add a great deal. Special effects are good but not too Hollywood-slick, which makes them all-the-more convincing. Humankind's common desire, unaided flying, is portrayed without strings attached: The flight scenes are, well, awesome, and they also capture the complications of achieving this dream. Plenty of surprises--love the ending.Still, ""Chronicle"" would benefit from a little more-in-general (only 84 minutes?!), which is, I suppose, the best sort of flaw a film can have.",Chronicle
114,Chris_Pandolfi,Boys Will Be Super Boys,7,3 February 2012,"""Chronicle"" makes a compelling case for what would happen if a group of teenage boys were to suddenly attain superhuman powers. They would not stare at each other in awe, as if they had just been touched by the hand of God. They would have fun with it, not just at their expense, but also at the expense of others. Initially, the boys in this film behave like the cast of ""Jackass,"" using their powers to pull dangerous stunts strictly for cheap thrills and a few laughs. They even pull pranks on unsuspecting people. One of them moves a parked car into a different parking space, leaving its owner confused. Another one sneaks into a toy store and makes a teddy bear float in front of a little girl, who can't be any older than six or seven. She understandably screams in terror. Once they get this out of their systems, I can see how they would then fly through the clouds and toss around a football, never once stopping to consider the idea that they might be in the flight path of a passenger jet.But what if these powers found their way into the life of a bullied, abused, socially awkward teen? At a certain point, it would no longer be enough to just have fun with it. In all likelihood, you would be pushed into using it against other people, people who have hurt you, humiliated you, ignored you for no real reason other than being who you are. High school can be a lot like that. The sad thing is that so few are willing to listen if someone is having a problem. It's common to even excuse teenage cruelty and hatred as ""kids being kids."" Some will look at this movie and see a reworking of the superhero genre, specifically the opening chapter in which the hero rises and the villain is unwittingly created. One could certainly make a case for such an interpretation. For whatever it's worth, I see it more as a sad parable about how mistreatment can only be tolerated for so long before a breaking point is reached.Taking place in suburban Seattle, the film is constructed, as many films are nowadays, as a found-footage mockumentary. Much of the action is shot by the story's tragic figure, a high school senior named Andrew (Dane DeHaan) who has decided to document his life on videotape. His mother, whom he cares for deeply, lies in her bedroom dying of cancer. His father, an unemployed firefighter (Michael Kelly), is a bitter alcoholic who not only physically abuses Andrew but also blames him for all the family's troubles. At school, he's regularly picked on by many of the students. He gets along with his cousin, Matt (Alex Russell), although there's always the sense that it hasn't always been this way. One night, while attending a rave at an abandoned barn, Andrew, Matt, and a new friend named Steve (Michael B. Jordan) discover a hole in the middle of the woods and decide to go in. A quick journey through a series of underground tunnels leads to the discovery of a cavern containing ... something mysterious.They quickly discover that their exposure to the object in the cave has given them super powers, including telekinesis and the ability to fly. It's all fun and games until Andrew nearly kills a driver by pushing his car off the road and into a lake. Matt tries to establish some ground rules, although Andrew is less than receptive. Andrew then uses his powers to make himself more popular in school. Of course it works, but you can see his frustration building. These students are not really his friends; had he not performed amazing tricks at the school talent show, he would remain the outcast he had always been. And it's not as if his home life has improved any. There are stages to Andrew's emotional breaking point, but it begins when his mother is in dire need of an unaffordable prescription medication. In his distress, he begins to see himself as an apex predator, believing himself to be stronger and therefore more worthy than all other human beings.Andrew's footage, filmed on a camera that he can make float in the air, is occasionally intercut with footage shot by a girl named Casey (Ashley Hinshaw), an internet blogger. Her purpose is pretty much limited to being a plot device, as she provides the audience with a camera perspective different from Andrew's. There are hints that she and Matt have a complicated romantic history, although it's alluded to so infrequently and comes off as so contrived that it begs the question of why it was included in the first place.And then there's the issue of the film's found-footage style, which was obviously chosen for its current marketability, especially in the horror genre. It works fairly well at first, but it gradually loses credibility until a climactic superhero-like duel on the streets of Seattle, at which point the illusion has shattered entirely. That's because we not only have Andrew's camera, but also surveillance equipment, police videos, civilian cell phones, and dozens of camcorders that just happen to be flying around Andrew and Matt as they hover near the Space Needle. I would think that, at that stage of the story, Andrew would long since have stopped documenting his life. The best bet would have been to shoot ""Chronicle"" with an ordinary omniscient camera. I don't think any of the film's more compelling aspects would have suffered as a result. And just think how nice it would have been to avoid the Queasy Cam.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",Chronicle
115,jose-cruz53,Excellent entertainment,8,27 December 2012,"Chronicle was perhaps one of the best movies of the rather mediocre 2012. Superhero movies are at an all time high these days, with blockbuster films like Amazing Spider Man, The Dark Knight Rises and The Avengers, but though these films boasted massive budgets and tons of explosions and action scenes they lacked the emotional intensity of less ""massive"" films like Chronicle. I wouldn't call Chronicle a low budget film, since it had a rather sizable budget of 15 million dollars, for me a really low budget film has a budget around 2-4 million dollars. :)Highly recommended as the best superhero film of 2012!",Chronicle
116,Thrashman88,Believable Teen Superheroes,8,22 September 2013,"I thought I read somewhere that ""Chronicle"" was not that good. I just saw it last night and was thoroughly entertained. The movie deals with 3 high school senior teens who find a strange artifact buried in the woods. This glimmering artifact gives them super hero powers like flying and levitating things. Through out the film, one of the teens (Andrew, played by Dane DeHaan) has a compulsion to tape everything on video, so the movie has that hand-held, ""blair witch project"" kind of vibe. Fortunately, it is not as shaky as ""Blair Witch"". The teens behave, talk and act about their new powers like a normal teen would do under such extraordinary circumstances. They begin to do pranks on people and slowly begin to show off their powers to their high school friends through a talent show. Almost 70% of the movie deals with this, pranks and stuff, but after that things start turning sour. Andrew is the shiest of the trio of teens. Having an ailing mother and an alcoholic father, Andrew seemed to find solace in video taping things, but after he gains his powers he begins a steady mental decay that jeopardizes the secret the trio of teens have sworn to keep.The Special Effects are particularly good and believable since we're supposed to be watching a movie shot on a High Def camcorder, so it does not have that fancy, typical Hollywood sheen to it. Nothing is really said about the artifact they encounter, whether it was from an alien or earth origin or what its purpose was, so the audience is pretty much in the dark about that, but so are the 3 main teen characters.They movie is barely 90 minutes long, but they will go by fast. I have to admit I really enjoyed ""Chronicle"" and my only gripe would be the title itself, because it doesn't give anything away. Chronicle of what??? Sure, the movie is supposed to be taped, but maybe another title, a darker title would've been more suitable.Anyway, ""Chronicle"" was blast to watch and I truly recommend it. 8 out of 10!",Chronicle
117,eshwarmail,A dark superhero thriller that is fun in its own way,8,13 October 2012,"Are we keeping a count on the number of found footage films that are being made these days. Or what about superhero movies? How about a combination? Well that sounds new. It is fresh and self aware of its reach and limitations and executes well within its boundaries though found footage aspect may not add much value to it.Matt (Alex Russell) is a cousin to awkward and abused Andrew (Dane DeHaan) and friends with flamboyant Steve (Michael B. Jordan). The trio chance upon an uncharted hole in the ground when they were wasted after a party. They slowly realize they got gifted with telekinetic powers after their encounter the previous night. After deciding to keep this secret to themselves and playing a few pranks on the locals, they start understanding how to practice and improve their acquired powers. Their social and domestic positions, life perspectives influence their decisions on how they are going to use their powers until one of them lose control.It works more as a superhero movie than a found footage one since it basically does not add any value. The script itself is quite powerful which does not require such additional gimmicks. The trio of relatively new actors does a commendable job especially Alex Russell as just another bunch of kids who suddenly acquire superpowers. Their transition from experimenting, practicing and losing control is superbly structured and very involving. It takes a much darker route than your average comic book styled action movie and the climax brings back glimpses of 'Carrie'. The cinematography is excellent though sometimes you may wonder what the character's camera is doing there. Full marks to editing and subtle use of special effects.A dark superhero thriller that is fun in its own way",Chronicle

He purchase a video camera in order to film his daily activities at home and at school but also for beat boredom from his lonely life. He has one friend who spend most of his time and one night at a party Andrew is mocked by a guy and he wake up in the parking, where is found by another colleague Steve and all three walks around until they discover a strange hall in the ground and being curious Steve enters then Matt and Andrew follows him. They encounter a strange crystal that seems to be out of this world and after being in contact with it all three have the power to move object around them without touching them. Starting with small objects to bigger then even persons they learn that will be put in the position to fight for their trust and for their life.The movie is good but not extraordinary I think the rating is a little exaggerated. The special effects were good but the story too torpid. OK they received the power of telekinesis but to humble innocent peoples in public places? Why? Because they didn't get along with the powers and some brain. So now they can fly like Superman? Those who posses this powers can move object around them but I don't think buses are among them.

119,Ryan_MYeah,Disappointing.,5,2 December 2012,"Chronicle may have its moments of pleasant distraction, but mostly feels like a wasted opportunity. The beginning and the ending of this film are crap, but everything in the middle is not all that bad. The best moments of this movie are when we get to see the three main characters testing out their newfound powers, and the talented (mostly) cast react to each circumstance properly. It's a great silver lining to a predictably clichéd script, and the effects are pretty nifty to look at. However, the movie wastes its potential with that gimmicky found footage format. If you don't like that style of shooting, this won't change your mind. The photography becomes distracting, irritating, headache inducing, and the climax feels like an eye sore. My question is this: Why did it need to be shot like this? What does it add to the movie? I'm not saying they had to ditch it entirely, maybe they could have balanced between hand-held camera work and traditional cinematography. Think 127 Hours. To be fair, it does use the found footage format better than most, but that's not saying much. That's like saying the crap I took this morning was better than the crap I took last night. Overall, it's a cautious rental.**1/2 / *****",Chronicle

122,doorsscorpywag,Carrie doesn't live here anymore!,8,29 April 2012,"Nice to see something with a bit of thought put in rather than the mindless Hollywood fare of the last few years. Not all that original as it's basically Carrie with guys but enjoyable to watch with believable characters for a change.A shy guy who is at the bottom of the food chain both at school and home buys a camera and is asked at a party by the schools 'popular guy' to come and film something he found along with shy guys cousin who happens to be shy guys only friend. It turns out to be something strange and glowing in a hole in the ground that seems to be making a weird sound. A strange noise is emitted which damages shy boys camera and then we find the three friends sitting at home three weeks later with telekinetic ability which is getting stronger by the hour.There seems an odd gap in between the discovery and the realisation. But that is where the clever touch comes in. This is not some lost footage film but instead viewed from the eye of not just shy boys camera but cameras which appear throughout the film. Shy boys cousin has bought him a new one hence the resumption of the film a couple of weeks after the discovery. They find they can now fly around and do all manner of super power stuff just by thinking about it.Normally the three would make costumes and become a crime fighting triumvirate but these guys do something more realistic. They begin to have fun. They play pranks some of which are really funny. Shy boy begins to find himself becoming popular due to a great turn at the school talent show.But of course realising that you are superior to all around you comes with a cost. It starts when shy boy and the popular kid become firm friends due to a shared dysfunctional home life. It begins to get out of hand and the fun stops and the action begins. The pranking takes a disturbing turn as shy boy realises he is no longer at the bottom of the food chain but is in fact at the top.Some of the effects are pretty good and the final segment really well done. In the end, like Carrie, shy boy finds out that becoming popular isn't as easy as one thinks sometimes.Some of the stuff in the film is pretty original especially the way the shy boy finds to allow us to follow the action. The acting is pretty good all round especially the three leads. A little short which is a shame but well worthy of the hour and a half it demands of you.",Chronicle
123,martinrobertson300482,"Thinks it's unique, and actually kind off is!",8,14 March 2012,"""Chronicle"" sums up my favourite off cinema experiences. Being pleasantly surprised by something I expected nothing from.Having heard (On the way into the cinema no less) that ""Chronicle"" was another ""caught on camera"" film, I expected the worst. But again, I should never off judged a book by its cover. This ""super hero"" film (Or maybe its just ""super power"" film) injects new life into an already over-used idea. The usual too-shaky-too-make-anything-out moment unfortunately made an appearance, but the subject matter off the movie, and use off many different cameras, made this perhaps the most believable ""found footage"" movie yet.Not that the plot is believable. Three teenagers get themselves some super powers and film themselves having lots off fun with them, until the inevitable dark side emerges in one off them. It would off been cooler if the dark stuff happened sooner than it does in the movie, but its still pretty fun until the point it does happen.In short, I went into ""Chronicle"" wanting too hate it. But found myself watching something that injects new life into the both over-used super-hero and found footage genres.

There's only one thing that I don't like here and it's the cliffhanger at the end, leaving some space for sequel(s). I guess that's what producers dictate, blackmailing artists. Otherwise, this could be perfectly rounded movie with ""a head and a tail"". Although it my appear so, this is not a sci-fi, but a story of relationships and circumstances. It stars rather slow but when it starts to run it does not stop until the very end, keeping your attention with abundance of details carefully put together.Highly recommended not only to people who just want to see a good movie (at last) but also to think about ""what would happen if..."".

126,ghost_dog86,How much found footage could there possibly be?!,7,16 February 2012,"Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I. AshlandThe fact that ""Chronicle"" does get around the shaky camera effects, which seem to plague these ""found footage"" films, in a very clever way, is almost worth the price of admission. Directed by Josh Trank, who single handedly saves this film from a ""Real World"" type of unwatchable teen monotony, aka watching teen boys attempt to talk to girls and cry about how they have no friends or how nobody understands them. As for the visuals, the special effects are what they are. Meaning, not impressive (in fact very corny at times), but since most of the plot is not going for any kind of serious drama, the kind you would find in a superhero movie such as ""The Dark Knight"", the low quality of the effects aren't played off as anything more than low quality special effects. In fact the only aspect of ""Chronicle"" that keeps this film from being an instant hit isn't the special effects or the camera work at all; it is the actual story itself.The premise of ""Chronicle"" plays out like a storyline off of the debunked television show ""Heroes"". You have one character who is the most popular guy in High School, another who is the semi-popular jock and lastly you have the loser cousin character, aka the character that gets the short ends of the stick in films like this. In ""Chronicle"" that character is named Andrew. Well, Andrew's mom is dying, his father is a raging alcoholic who beats him, and over time he has essentially turned himself into that misfit character from ""American Beauty"", who creepily films everything. OK, so in the movie these guys happen to be at the same house party, where they find a mysterious crater-like hole in a field near the house and decide to explore it. Why? Because they are teenage boys I guess. In it they make a discovery that gives them superpowers, which in turn leads each one of them down very different paths; some darker than others. The smartest aspect about the plot line itself is that it doesn't try to bore the audience to tears by explaining a long drawn out back-story, about what the origins of the mysterious thing in the mysterious hole that gives the boys said mysterious superpowers. Another thing that works in this plot's favor is how realistic it attempts to be. And before I get comments criticizing me for thinking a movie about teenagers who obtain super powers is realistic, let me stop you right there. I mean realistic in the sense that if a group of actual teenage boys one day received ""super powers"", it would be highly doubtful that they would try and save the world or anything like that. Chances are your average teenage boy would do just as the adolescents in ""Chronicle"" did; that is, fly around for no reason other than to see what it's like, blow cheerleaders skirts up, and throw baseballs at each other's faces in order to see if they could stop the baseball with their minds. Interesting stuff right? Well, for a while it is. But with that realistic feel, eventually comes with it the downfall of ""Chronicle"". When it becomes apparent that the characters are not going to help anybody or do anything of note (with their powers) in certain instances, the story does become bland and or lackluster. To be fair, the climax does become more conventional and over dramatized, in a Marvel-ish style, which most audiences may enjoy a lot more than the first half of the film. With all of that said, the biggest reason that ""Chronicle"" works is because of the camera work. It is as simple as that. If you are hesitant to see this film because you think ""Chronicle"" is going to contain lose-your-lunch visuals resembling ""Cloverfield"" or ""I can't see what's going on"" visuals resembling ""The Blair Witch Project"" or ""The Devil Inside"", then you can lay your fears to rest because this film contains none of that, while still maintaining its hand-held camera integrity. How does it do that you ask? Well, you have to watch the movie to find out. I know, lame right?Final Thought: The camera work is substantially more impressive than any story ""Chronicle"" has to tell. And while it is, for the most part, semi-entertaining, at the end of the day most of ""Chronicle"" feels like an underdeveloped, teenage, MTV version of ""Unbreakable"". Plus, if you are expecting some kind of origins story, with a stylish comic book, saving the world, hero vs. villain likability, viewer beware: ""Chronicle"" is in no way that. But if you go in with an open mind, ""Chronicle"" is sure to surprise most, as (if nothing more) an impressive spin on the seemingly played out hand-held, found footage, faux-documentary genre.

127,gregeichelberger,"Worst movie of the year, so far",1,31 January 2012,"One can try to couch this in any term one may want, but Universal Picture's ""Chronicle,"" nothing more than ""Children Of the Damned"" meets ""Heroes"" and filmed in ""Cloverfield""-vision, is as profoundly a bad movie as one will see this year.And, perhaps the next few years, for that matter.Despite fawning critics, there is nothing even remotely redeemable about this picture, from acting (the film stars absolutely no one, for a reason), direction (Josh Trank in his first — and hopefully last — big screen effort), special effects, production values and a basic plot line.It's as if Trank (who also is responsible for co-writing with Max Landis) woke up one morning, wrote a series of incomprehensible sentences on a piece of paper, cut them up into individual words, put them in a hat and then drew out one word at time. Thus, the screenplay of this monstrosity was born.There are lines that have NOTHING to do with any story uttered by a young cast that should no doubt be toiling in the food service industry by the end of the year. There are scenes which will cause not only film fans, but casual observers to wonder out loud: ""Did I just see what I thought I saw, or have I been smoking crystal meth for the last week and a-half?"" I will do my best to explain this plot (if that's even conceivable). Three high school students, the wimpy loner Andrew (Dane Dehaan, ""True Blood"" TV series, who is just two years younger than the director, I weep for today's youth), his cousin Matt (Alex Russell) and popular Steven (Michael B. Jordan, ""Red Tails""), discover a rogue coal mine.Upon entering — which is contrary to every instinct the loser Andrew feels — the trio becomes super-radiated, or whatever, and later discover they have power over natural law. So much so, that they can stop baseballs from hitting their faces, can manipulate large objects and fly.Yes, they can propel themselves through the sky with little or effort and the only reaction is Matt saying, ""You know, guys, this was like the best day ever."" Giggle, giggle. The boys also become very popular at parties, the cool kids now dig them and Andrew uses this special ability to walk a tight rope and juggle in a school talent show.Andrew is also able to take revenge on his alcoholic father and all of the bullies who have picked on him his entire life. Like we have not seen this plot before.As things in these kind of movies turn, however, the fun is over all too soon and one of the members is on the wrong end of a lightening strike, while the remaining two battle it out in a listless conclusion over the city of Seattle. These scenes rip off ""Superman II"" and ""The Incredible Hulk,"" but by this time, few will care at all.I, sadly, gave up on this one early when Andrew began filming EVERYTHING on his video camera. Once a film establishes this point of view, though, it has to maintain it consistently throughout (including awkward scenes where a character films his or herself). ""Chronicle"" does not maintain these shots, nor does it really seem concerned about it, expect in a ridiculous sequence where a girl is falling from the Space Needle, but films the entire drop.That scene, along with the world's worst acting and dialogue are all I needed to give this one a huge ""skip it."" I know I am in the huge minority here, but the shallowness and idiocy of this movie will eventually be recognized, and you will say you read it here first.",Chronicle

Soon, though, they find their lives spinning out of control and their bond tested as they embrace their darker sides.As we all know, superhero movies nowadays don't exactly share differences. Some superhero movies may be good, but it's all the same, nothing new is injected into genre. When I first saw the Chronicle trailer, I didn't expect it to be that great. In fact, honestly, I found the trailer cheesy and lame. That, though, did not ruin my trip to the theater, and I was blown away... In Chronicle, we have actors that we probably have never seen. We don't have all these big actors used in every movie, but something new. Thing is, these kids can act! I never seen such talent for (1. this is the director's FIRST movie) and (2. this is the first movie the guys have been in.) I never expected this, so I was greatly happy when this happened. Next, the special effects! Again, with this being the director's movie we can tell he's up for some big stuff. These special effects were like Transformers, and most of it looked believable, if we were in this kind of world. I can't wait for what else this guy has for us. I also have to brag about how good the editing was. While a superhero found footage movie sounds over-the-top, they filmed it so brilliantly. The protagonist floats the camera above him so you can see what's going on, and later on, the filming switches over to another recording device. It was really unique to see this, because I never foresaw what they could've done to make it happen. I also loved the deeper meaning within this movie. Although it seems like a teenage story, it's really not. The movie is really mature in it's own way, and it's sad to see people denying this. All in all, I recommend Chronicle.

It usually portends poorly for the videographers. Indeed, the ""found"" part strongly implies that there were no survivors, which kind of kicks the suspense in the head. No more ""How are they gonna get out of THIS one?"", more like the Final Destination question of ""Who's gonna get it now, and how?"".But, while this loss of suspense is certainly a strike against a movie from the outset, it can be overcome by clever storytelling, and that's the case here. 3 unknown actors — Michael B. Jordan as Steve Montgomery, likable popular guy; Dane DeHaan as diffident school spittoon Andrew Detmer; and Alex Russell (no relation) as Andrew's philosophical, understanding, good-guy cousin Matt Garetty — use 95% of the screen time to do a highly credible job of showing what it would be like for ordinary high-school boys to acquire telekinetic powers, which slowly strengthen as they exercise them.We hardly see Andrew at all in the beginning, as its his camera that's being used to film everything, and he's behind it, not in front of it. But it turns out that he has a natural knack for the TK thing, and soon he's using mind power to float the camera at a distance so he can be included in the picture. (This is a clever work-around for some of the inherent limitations of the found-footage approach.)The only credibility problem in the film (aside from the basic premise) was that the lads didn't use their powers to excel on the school sports teams. Man, I would have totally done that! Otherwise what they ACTUALLY do is completely believable, and that snares us with vicarious buy-in.

But with great power, we are reminded, comes great responsibility, and one of the fellas is a tad short in that department, so things take a turn toward the alarming after we get past the wheee part.Andrew has been treated as a loser his entire life, most notably by his alcoholic ex-firefighter dad, who lavished all his love on his wife (now dying of some unspecified chronic respiratory disease) and has nothing but contempt, anger, and abuse for Andrew. But now, with new-found powers and growing self-confidence, Andrew doesn't see why he should have to take crap from anybody any more. So he starts striking back. Then he discovers that he likes it. Then he decides he's cut out to be what he calls an ""alpha predator"" and begins predating.Steve and especially Matt try to reason with him, but it doesn't go well.This is a movie that follows its hook straight thru without blinking or apologizing. The many effects were seamless. And, as a plot tactic, I was particularly struck by how somebody would start to do something, then decide it wasn't working and try something else. This happens all the time in real life but hardly ever in the movies, and it added to the serious verisimilitude. Props to screenwriter Max Landis and director Josh Trank for nailing the feel of real people in the real world.",Chronicle
132,freaky_dave,Well Done movie,8,3 February 2012,"What would happen if teenagers in real life gain superpowers. The new movie Chronicle, with a clever script by Max Landis, and smart direction by Josh Trank, answers that question.Andrew (Dane Dahaan) is a troubled youth who one day decides to videotape everything that happens in his life. His father is a violent drunk, and his mother is very sick and bedridden, and he is an outcast in school who is often bullied. Using the camera as a sort of shield to hide behind all this sadness, him and his cousin Matt, (Alex Russell) with the persuasion of class president Steve (Michael B. Jordan) find a hole in the ground in the woods. THey go down and investigate and find something strange and alien.A few days pass, and the three boys soon discover that their excursion into the hole with the glowing alien object has somehow granted them superpowers. The thing in the hole is never really explained, and neither is how they gain these abilities, but an explanation is not needed. Once again the secrets of how and why are left to the imagination, and that is probably best.Instead of using their powers to go and fight crime, like the heroes in comic books like X- Men or Spider Man, the three friends use them to do what most teenagers would do if they had powers, by playing games and pulling pranks. Quite a few of the pranks are clever, and one of the best scenes in the movie deals with a magic show, which helps to make Andrew popular for a little while before things start to turn dark in the second half. I won't go into details on what happens, but if you've seen the trailers, you'll know that one of them turns dark, and the other two have to pull together to try and stop him from going over the edge.The climax is a pretty good special effects wonder for the budget this movie was given. It does tend to go way over top, and will make people wonder how human beings can take such punishment, but I was still drawn in mainly because of the three main leads who are perfect in this film.Overall, the first part of this movie up until the magic show is the best half. The second half is also good, but the realistic feel of the movie goes a little haywire. Still, I enjoyed this movie and recommend it. I think it will be a surprise sleeper hit.",Chronicle
133,tr91,Great fun movie & visually amazing,8,2 August 2013,"This film was a pleasant surprise, much better than I expected. The storyline is quick and straight to the point. I like the idea of the guys all filming it on their camera, it was a unique way to watch a film.The plot is fairly simple but extremely effective. The 3 main characters are all played by actors I have never seen before and it felt really fresh, they was all very good. The film had much more humour than I had expected, there was some funny one liners and also when they got their powers there was some really funny scenes of testing them out etc, really different to anything I have seen before. The special effects in this film were incredible, you just have to see it for yourself. It really did look amazing.After a twist, the main character starts to lose control and ends up causing absolute carnage, this was just a breathtaking last 10-15 minutes of action.Overall a very enjoyable film, short and straight to the point. I would recommend this film to all.9/10.",Chronicle

135,stevepat99,One of Every Ten Viewers Gave it Thumbs Down,1,13 March 2012,"My buddy and I looked at the 72% rating and 86% on Rotten Tomatoes and rushed to see it.... our stomaches were churning out of control at 20 minutes in and at 35-40 minutes into the film we fled the theater. Still what does it all mean, such high ratings that is??? How do the 2,000 of 20,000 who gave the film thumbs down figure this out in advance? (1) Read the worst negative reviews and see if they offer 'buzz' words that relate to YOU...i.e. story about three moronic, idiot teens who become super power enhanced moronic teens. (2) Read 10 star reviews and look for 'buzz' words that offer clues to why you might go thumbs down i.e...young teenagers will love this film...when you can not recall your teen years. Ex. great film of hand-held genre with teens having super powers, albeit mostly using them for 'silly teen stunts' etc. (3) Note the few top critics who gave big thumbs down and check their reviews of future films (4) More 'buzz' words from thumbs up reviews that at least 2000 thumbs down viewers should have taken head of: (1) Then they act as any normal teenager would if suddenly given superpowers, THEY GOOF OFF (2)that is fun for the first half (so now we know the juvenile 'teen stunts and goof offs' cover half the movie) confirmed in our 35-40 minutes of viewing.Finally this: 'it's a wild, wild ride that might lose some viewers in the process.....' well said...Know that this film, even from thumbs up reviews, requires that you sit through half the film before one gets to the 'good/best 'stuff' and many like myself and my buddy had to give up after donating 35-40 minutes of our life watching gross teens doing stupid things non-stop in moronic mode.",Chronicle
136,oshram-3,Surprisingly effective and smart,8,30 June 2012,"Chronicle follows the story of three high-schoolers, popular Steve (Michael B. Jordan, who was so exquisite in The Wire), brainy Matt (Alex Russell), and his withdrawn cousin Andrew (Dane DeHaan, looking occasionally like a young, angry Leonardo DiCaprio). Andrew starts going through his phase where he films everything, and we are treated to his lonely, abuse-filled existence for the first fifteen minutes of the movie until Matt prevails upon him to join him at a party. While Andrew films the rave, the story is interrupted by Steve's discovery of a sinkhole nearby, which the three boys investigate, only to find some weird glowing artifact buried within (intentionally shaky camera-work obscures just exactly what the McGuffin is). Whatever it is, it imbues them with psychic powers, predominantly telekinesis, which starts off small – Andrew builds a replica of the Space Needle out of Legos using just the power of his mind – but graduates to larger stunts, namely the moving of someone's car while she's shopping in the mall, and then fatefully, Andrew casually tosses a pick-up truck off the road when the driver following them becomes too aggressive for his liking.The film does cover some familiar super-hero ground – newfound powers and how to deal with them – but it's immeasurably smarter than the average journey down this lane. You don't even know it will be a sci-fi movie until about twenty minutes in (it seems like an indie flick about teens), and where Chronicle really stands out is that finally, finally, someone understands that story stems from character (okay, Joss Whedon demonstrated that in The Avengers, but that was a rare exception). Each character is smartly thought-out and more importantly stays consistent when his powers develop into a great deal more than any of them imagined (special mention must be made of the initial flying scene, which was the most innovative of its type since we first saw Chris Reeve do it thirty-five years ago – the sheer joy these kids feel when they learn to break the earth's bonds is infections and terrifically captured).The performances all around are aces. All three young leads stand out – it's hard to prefer one over the other. Michael B. Jordan shines here – with the right projects, he could be a huge box office sensation. Alex Russell is strong throughout, and Dane DeHaan – who gets the lion's share of screen time and the darker role – is simply superb. The movie's just plain clever as well; it's just smartly thought-out and feels satisfyingly realistic (especially compared to tripe like the Tobey Maguire Spider-man films). The use of faked surveillance footage also adds to the realism as it's so adroitly done (and probably saved quite a few pennies on special effects). The few showy effects – Andrew splits apart a spider into its component pieces – are so well realized they feel eminently natural. From every angle this movie surprised me.It was only toward the very end, when (naturally in a super-powered movie) things get out of hand that the light bulb went on over my head and I saw an additional shading of genius in this movie: it is, for all intents and purposes, a live-action Akira, except that it's really well done and doesn't have a crappy let down of an ending. There is no longer any need for anyone else to even attempt this, for Josh Trank (director) and Max Landis (screenplay) have already achieved it, far better than any adaptation of Otomo's work could (and indeed, more satisfyingly than Otomo's original version). I've gushed enough. This movie brilliantly exceeded all my expectations and deserves a lot more exposure than it's gotten. It's smart, engrossing, sharp, and best of all, it didn't cost hundreds of millions of dollars to make. It just goes to show if you have good ideas and a good, well-told story that you don't have to break the bank. I'll be anxious to see what these guys do next, but honestly, it would be hard to top this.",Chronicle
137,pontifikator,Meh.,5,20 February 2012,"This oft-told tale is co-written by Max Landis and Josh Trank, with Trank as the director.The movie starts out with Andrew (Dane DeHaan) videotaping himself to chronicle his life. For a few moments I was afraid I'd drifted into ""Blair Witch"" territory, but the self-taping was the only similarity. We meet the likable Matt (Alex Russell), Andrew's cousin. Matt is smarter than the average kid and shows it. Then we meet the third of our trio of heroes, Steve (Michael B. Jordan). Steve is the most popular kid in high school, a shoo-in for class president. At a party, Andrew is lured by Steve and Matt out into the woods where they've found a mysterious hole which the fall or jump in. In the depths of the cavern they find a mysterious glowing thing that gives them powers. I had read a review that made the movie sound great, and saw previews that made me expect a semi-comedy. The thrust seemed to be that high school boys get super powers and explore them as only the insane, immature boys in their teens could. I was misled. It's another coming-of-age movie. Andrew is a nerd, he's bullied at school, he's bullied at home, and he's got no girls. His self-taping may be a way to distance himself from himself, dissociation it's called. ""This isn't happening to me, it's that guy on the monitor there."" The movie drags till they get super powers and explore them. It's mildly amusing watching the teens learn to move things (they make a tower of legos), learn to levitate, and then move on to using a leaf blower and blow girls' skirts up. Childish stuff. But Andrew is abused at home, and his powers take a dark turn. He gets in the school talent show and pretends to be a magician who can play card tricks, juggle, and walk a tightrope, all of which are manifestations of his powers. The crowd goes wild! Only a nerd could imagine a high school crowd going wild over card tricks and juggling, I'm afraid. But that's the script. Things go wrong with Andrew's attempted initiation into sex, and he spirals into the dark side as things go wrong at home.In addition to some script problems, DeHaan is 25, Russell is 25, and Michael is is 25. All the students at the high school look like they're in their mid-twenties, too, and the parties are even more sophisticated that 20-somethings throw. I'm sorry to say there was zero credibility as a high school group. And while there's some motivation for Andrew's use of the powers for evil, there are no real scenes showing Andrew, Matt, and Steve as people who have some feelings and longings. Steve is the least well-scripted of the trio, and when he dies, there's no sense of loss from us the audience nor from the remaining duo. It's basically a set up for the power struggle between good and evil as Matt and Andrew fight with big things up in the sky and through skyscrapers. It's basically the same coming of age movie as ""Star Wars,"" ""Donnie Darko,"" and their sci-fi ilk. I would say it's not worth seeing as it adds nothing to the genre. If you like failed experiments, I recommend as noble failures ""Donnie Darko"" and ""Liquid Sky,"" a totally different coming of age story directed and co-written by Slava Tsukerman. The best coming of age movie is ""The Princess Bride,"" followed closely by ""Stand by Me,"" both directed by the brilliant Rob Reiner.",Chronicle
138,CMTiago,Found Footage done right,8,29 May 2014,"Found Footage done rightBy now I'm sure we have all had our heads done in by the found footage craze, spearheaded by the ever growing popular Paranormal Activity franchise, which I consider to be some of the most uneventful pieces of cinema today. With Chronicle we get something that I have craved for in a movie shot with hand held cameras: an actual story with interesting and complicated characters. All of our protagonists are regular people who, in the midst of acquiring powers, must find out how to deal with them and how it will affect everyone around them. The talent involved in the film is great, with all of the leads playing their roles superbly. Not only does this help the movie in its overall quality, but also allows for the audience to connect to the characters they're seeing on screen. Although the style continues to bother me, the found footage style has finally showcased its full potential with this fantastic film. If only there were more just like it.Rating 8/10",Chronicle
139,sam_smithreview,"very interesting idea and story, not the greatest execution",6,23 April 2016,"For a film, the story was very cool and pretty original. Kids getting powers and instead of the whole cliché moment where they become super heroes and start fighting these super villains that appear roughly same time as them. Chronicle makes it more real. The kids, don't have any responsibility and don't fight crime.The movie asks, what will happen if teenagers in real life have superpowers? In this film, the kids are just recording themselves having fun with their powers. And one of them will use it more for revenge than saving the day. It's a clever idea.It could have been filmed in a regular movie camera. The found- footage style is pretty unnecessary. The film doesn't need that to look credible. Also, there are too many random cameras and angles which is kind of awkward. Though, the shot was pretty good. But it's still unnecessary. The CGI works better in large objects. It looks dated when comes to the small ones like the spider and the Lego's. Dane DeHaan, Alex Russell, and Michael B. Jordan are all fun together. It gets better in the third act. Dane DeHaan gives a great rage to Andrew. The climax is awesomely fun, the film could have had a better finale and maybe a better ending 3rd act all together, but overall the acting wasn't to bad and the film was impressive for what it was.A Surprise",Chronicle
140,ThreeGuysOneMovie,not so clever idea of found footage,6,26 May 2012,"The best I can give this film is a meh. Chronicle is another in a long line of super power origin stories that has been done to death using the not so clever idea of found footage that is plague upon modern cinema. It doesn't help that during the scenes when people are flying you can almost see the crane and harness they are using. Similarly, forcing the film to stick with its found footage format really hinders the suspension of disbelief aspect of the film. It's almost like the director can't wait to have Andrew gain some powers so he can have him use telekinesis to have a camera float above the character for the rest of the film. If that is going to be the case why not just shoot this without the found footage technique? check out our full review at 3guys1movie.com",Chronicle

In an attempt to put a new spin on an old human trauma-based social issue, the movie makers create a few tricks and some ... er.... whatever... about three teens coming into contact with deep underground crystals and developing paranormal powers.Blood, tears, death, misery and a bunch of stuff occurs and oddly, in this day and age when police tend to shoot to kill and ask questions later, nah uh, not in this pic... first, they allowed their entire police force to be annihilated, whilst yelling politely, 'Stop right there, stop right there...' while buildings topple, buses are smashed into tenth story windows and cars are sent into oblivion... naturally... perhaps if all of this hadn't been in this terrible movie, we might have had to have a story and a conclusion not based on sentimental sloppy, lazy, lazy, lazy movie making.",Chronicle
142,cadillac20,A great new entry into superpower mythos films,8,3 February 2012,"Chronicle is one of those films that kind of snuck up on everyone and may very well have slid under the radar if not for a somewhat dead weekend in February and good word of mouth. And it's rightfully earned. After last weeks fantastic The Grey, the new year continues to produce good film with one of the most interesting takes on the comic book film in a long time.Now, you might be tempted to blow this off as another low budget, shaky cam movie ala Paranormal Activity, but you'd be wrong. Firstly, this is a film that establishes it's lead ""camera men"" as experienced with a camera, so shaky cam is mostly gone from the film. We also have some other rather interesting excuses for better than average faux-doc filming, namely the main character's ability to levitate his camera around to get multiple angles. Suffice to say, the camera work is mostly good and legitimized so it never feels like it's too good. So, if you fear that this is just another poorly made hand-held excursion, fear not. This is a very well made hand-held excursion.The story itself is nothing terribly new or original. A group of teens inexplicably get super powers from some weird, glowy crystals and that's about it. But where most stories about super powered people might find them fighting evil or exploring human nature, Chronicle takes it's time to show a more realistic approach. Our characters play pranks, gain popularity, and try to just have fun. Also realistic are how the powers come out in other forms, manifesting the inner turmoil of one troubled teen who becomes too powerful for his own good. Although the story may not be wholly original, the script is pretty good and the films take on both the hand-held film sub genre and the super powered sub genre is good. This is a more grounded look at what might happen should we find ourselves with power we can't understand. We don't get noble causes or some epic quest to save the world, we simply get teens who are being teens, albeit with telekinetic abilities. I read this film compared to Carrie, and it's somewhat accurate, only this is Carrie x5.It helps that the leads do a great job in their respective roles. They seem naturals as the teens, and DeHann in particular is great as the troubled Andrew. We can see what's to come, but when his turn finally comes, most noticeably in a scene involving a spider, it's a frightening wake up call to the true nature of the forces at work here. There is some reality in this film, and it's frightening to think what some might do with that kind of power if given it. Even with that last bit of darkness at the end of the film, it's fun, and shown in a very intimate way. Being so up close and personal with the action is exhilarating and there are moments when the film even feels like a ride for a time. There are several good scenes displaying the use of the teens power, but the final 15 minutes are some of the most exciting, super powered moments of any film of it's kind. The fact that it feels more realistic than, say, something like Iron Man makes it feel that much more exciting. It's like watching a high school fight, but pushed to the 10th degree.Suffice to say, Chronicle was a pleasant surprise. It's the kind of film you hope to walk into. As a fan of comic book films, it was especially pleasing as it really shakes the genre and tries, successfully I might add, to do something very different. It could have been a complete disaster with typical hand-held filming and a typical story. But the smart and creative take on the genre makes this another in the great beginning of 2012.",Chronicle
143,dcobbimdb,The hand held camera just bugged me too much,4,17 February 2012,"I liked the story itself, Even though I'm a little old for the demographic group of this movie. However I'm very much into sci-fi / action / Marvel comic book super heroes kinds of movies, so other than it being a high schoolish group I was on board with the material. The script I thought was decent and actually the special effects were pretty good as well for being a 'B' low budget kind of movie. So all these factors for me bumped it up to a 4/10That said what knocked it down for me was the whole hand held camera aspect which I just couldn't get into and at times really bugged me. Granted it probably didn't help that I was more near the front, so perhaps sitting in the back more would have helped some. But movies like this, Blair witch project and Cloverfield where the entire movie is filmed with a hand held camera and most of the time a foot away from peoples faces shaking much of the time, while some may argue tries to bring a realistic ""being there"" kind of feel, but to me I go to a movie to get away from reality and just to be entertained, not to be turned dizzy for $10. You want to create that ""being there"" feel, then do it in the 8mm like Saving Private Ryan, not like this. Within the first 2 minutes of this movie I felt like walking out, and that feeling persisted for about the first 20 - 30 minutes. Luckily though the movie picked up and I could kind of get past the hand held cam bit. But the other dumb thing about the movie was all the emotional scenes and there must have been 5-6 of these where someone would say ""Just turn the camera off"" and you as the viewer are thinking ""yeah and then you'd have no movie"" which pretty much leads into my other big related gripe which was far too much attention was being given to the camera itself, to the point where it too should have been listed in the credits.Another thing for me was the lead character, a rather boring very introverted, creepy looser type of kid who at times was just painful to watch. His friends weren't that much better either and I don't really blame this on the actors per say, I think they acted exactly as scripted and directed Overall I think I would have liked this movie a whole lot better had it been shot with standard cinematography rather that this hand held crap and I don't think it would have taken away anything from the film and I now know never to see a movie filmed in this way again, no matter how good the material / story may be",Chronicle
144,JimmyCollins,Ridiculous in every way.,1,10 February 2012,"I went to see Chronicle the day that it was released, I'd seen the trailer once before and that was all i had seen if it, there was very little promotion for it I found, and I was surprised St how many people were showing up to a seemingly under the radar film, it didn't take long for me to realize that this movie was really really bad. Pretty much straight off the bat the acting is terrible and it doesn't get better as the film progresses, the plot line is OK I suppose but the fact that so much is left to the viewers imagination, you never know any type of back story as to how theses teens get super powers from a rock in the ground, it's just not good enough I think, and yes I know that it's a found footage film but still it's just really unimpressive.So many times I just felt like drifting off to sleep, I wasn't the least bit interested in any of the characters, all 3 have nothing likable about any of them, and the scenes that are meant to be the wow scenes are just lack luster.The climax at the end of the movie is really the only half good thing about it, but by the time it finally comes around it's too late for you to care. I would highly highly highly recommend saving your money and waiting til you can see it for free. I honestly cannot see how this terrible film is getting the amazing reviews that it is getting. But I guess everyone is different, but for me i was just not into it. Lame times ten.",Chronicle
145,piratecannon,Power Trip,7,26 December 2012,"Like so many movies of the past decade,Chronicle is one that makes use of the ""handycam"" technique. In other words, it's told from the perspective of several hand-held camcorders so as to give it a more authentic (and ultimately, perhaps, more personal) atmosphere. The technique works here, as it's the sort of thing you'd expect from a socially awkward high school student who uses the device to—in his words —create a barrier from himself and the harsh nature of the reality he inhabits.The story is minimalist in its presentation, and that's just fine. It follows the increasingly familiar narrative arc that finds an otherwise oblivious group of protagonists stumbling across something extraordinary and coping with its effects on their lives (in this case, that something is a pulsing blue crystal in the middle of the Washington wilderness). How or where the object came from is irrelevant, as our focus is directed to the teens who, through their interaction with the mysterious item, gain unbelievable powers that grant them the ability to manipulate objects at will. Everything is fun and games at the beginning: they spend their time playing practical jokes on unsuspecting victims in toy stores, relocating the automobiles of mall shoppers, and throwing baseballs at one another to see who can best ""control"" their abilities. As each character's personality is further hashed out, though, we see what really makes them tick. In the case of Andrew (Dane DeHaan), we get a character who's tired of being bullied by everyone in his life (the lone exception being his dying mother). As Andrew's power grows so does his penchant for darker musings.There's an effort to work tragedy into the story, too, as a perfect storm of circumstances sees Andrew stealing and murdering in an effort to obtain enough money to buy the costly medication that will sustain his mother's life. When she dies and his alcoholic father blames him for her passing, he loses control, unleashing his rage on downtown Seattle. It's quite the spectacle, and, at times, feels a little too Hollywood. While the first 9/10 of the movie are guerilla-esque, the end is borderline laughable. Buses are hurled through the air and skyscrapers are demolished, all while our anti-hero screams at the top of his lungs like an afternoon matinée villain.Another problem is that Andrew's shifting moods—from ecstasy at having finally found some friends and rage at the sight of his abusive dad— feels a little too jarring. The transition from angst to downright malevolence feels a little too forced, and this detracts from any emotional empathy that might exist.Most of the movie, though, is competent enough, and there's just enough philosophy and old school Shakespearean melodrama to make it stand out from the crowd.",Chronicle
146,EmmaDinkins,Chix Chat on Film review: Boys will be boys.,6,6 February 2012,"The name of the film Chronicle gives some insight into what will take place, a chronicling of something by someone. In this case it is Alex (Dane DeHaan) who at the onset of the story has made a decision to capture everything on film. The audience immediately learns who he is and the circumstances surrounding his life through some very Cloverfield-esque footage. I do not care for this film making style, but I will say that it was done better than some others, since the camera was much steadier. It's known from the trailer that this is a story of a trio of super powered young men, in addition to Alex the other two key players are Matt (Alex Russell) who comes across as the voice of reason and Steve (Michael B. Jordan) who is the popular man on campus. I had just seen Mr. Jordan in one of my new favorite movies Red Tails, and recall him as Reggie Montgomery from All My Children, which marked the end of an era with its demise, it is missed. I was not pleased with the stereotypical outcome regarding Steve, but the special effects that led up to it were done quite nicely. In all had it not been for the effects I would have found this to be just another silly teenage boys hijinks film with them enhanced by a hyper steroidal side effect from whatever they came into contact with. I wanted to know, what happened to the boys, but since it was a retelling from their point of view and none of them seemed to remember, then conversely the audience didn't get to know either. It seemed that it was a savvy set up for a sequel that would begin with suppressed memories emerging. The climatic good versus evil battle was very reminiscent of the Hancock He versus She smack-down, and it made the film take a completely different pace from the beginning of the film, which I found to be refreshing since the beginning was a bit slow. I didn't want to dwell on the things from the movie that I felt were borrowed from other films, but I did think that they could have borrowed from some other source a better ending. I have thought of a number of ways that the final scenes could have culminated, but figured that the early mention of something so odd as Tibet, would have to be worked in somehow. I give it an amber light.",Chronicle

I've never read comic books, but I like the idea of being different from society. Chronicle rides this line with excellent finesse and skill. I loved the lack of a traditional exposition, with the movie instead diving straight into the main trio learning how to use their powers. Dane DeHaan's family dynamic was fantastic, Michael B. Jordan's personable characteristics were much-needed, and Alex Russell's overall resolve really brought the movie full circle. Really the only complaint I have is that it was on the short side.

148,ksj870,What Would You Do With Super Powers?,9,9 July 2012,"Every comic book fan grows up dreaming of having super powers. Wish fulfillment is big part of what makes comic books so enchanting, and to find oneself gifted with Herculean strength, the ability to fly at the speed of light, or the power to move objects by willpower alone would be the ultimate wish come true for legions of superhero fans the world over.Chronicle, a film directed by Josh Trank, takes the innocent fantasy to its logical conclusion: what if three very average teenage boys suddenly found themselves in possession of the last ability listed above—telekinesis, or the power to manipulate the physical world with the mind. What would three typical 21st-century kids really do with that kind of power? And would they find that power a blessing, or a curse? For the story to work as anything other than just another superhero film, the three leads have to be easy to identify with and believable as everyday teens who are inexplicably singled out by a Fate they do not understand. Fortunately, the three young men who carry the picture (Dane DeHaan, Alex Russell and Michael B. Jordan) are all exceptional actors who have no trouble selling their parts. At no point do any of the boys behave in a way that should surprise the viewer, even if at times we are shocked by their choices.At first, much like Peter Parker/Spider-Man,the boys don't plan to do anything special with their newfound powers. They play telekinetic baseball in the backyard, they play pranks on oblivious people in public. The most ambitious thing any of them contemplate doing with their abilities is winning the school talent show, which one of the kids, an outcast with an abusive father and a mother dying of cancer, hopes will win him the respect from his peers he has so long been denied. But for the most part, it seems the boys don't consider doing anything remotely superhero-like with their powers, and they certainly don't want anybody else to suspect what they can do.But as the boys experiment with their powers and learn how those powers can be used in their everyday lives, things begin to change. And one of the boys slowly begins to reason that he has perhaps become something higher than a regular human, that he may be the next step in the evolutionary process and that he has, in effect, become the world's new ""Apex Predator."" It is at this point that the lives of three boys begin to take a tragic turn. Will they master their new powers and learn to use them responsibly, or will they give in to the temptation to make themselves little gods? Chronicle is a sober, well-written and entirely believable variation on the usual superhero tale. Like Watchmen, it examines those blessed with ultranormal abilities from a realistic perspective, and while it acknowledges many genre stereotypes, it puts an entirely new spin on most of them. Chronicle is at times heartwarming, funny, and finally even tragic, but ultimately it is a must-see for every boy who grew up with the comics wishing for a super power of their own.",Chronicle
149,caseymoviemania,Casey's Movie Mania: CHRONICLE (2012) Review,8,13 April 2012,"Found-footage genre has already fast becoming a fading gimmick, even though many Hollywood filmmakers are still milking the trend since it's cheap to make and it's often profitable (e.g. PARANORMAL ACTIVITY series). But not so for CHRONICLE -- a unique and exciting blend of found-footage concept mixes with superhero genre. Yup, how come nobody thought of that earlier? No doubt both director Josh Trank (who previously helmed a few episodes in the short-lived TV series called The Kill Point) and writer Max Landis (yup, he's the son of the legendary John Landis) knows well how to have fun with the genre mishmash, while successfully raises an all-important question that makes this movie so compulsively watchable: What happens if someone granted a superpower but ends up abusing it for the wrong reason? It also helps when Landis's screenplay offers considerable logic that makes this superhero genre all the more involving.Full review at http://caseymoviemania.blogspot.com/2012/02/chronicle-2012.html",Chronicle
150,rmarkd,"not bad, just didn't quite do it for me",6,24 May 2020,"Chronicle is a movie about three kids Andrew (Dane DeHaan), Matt (Alex Russell), and Steve (Michael B. Jordan). Andrew is the outcast kid, Matt is his more popular and I guess smarter cousin, and Steve is the uber popular kid running for student president. Andrew has decided to film his life and so most of the movie is from this ""found footage"" point of view.Andrew's confidence and popularity grows as his friendship grows with Matt and particularly Steve, all which crashes down at a party. Andrew gets all angry and ends up accidentally killing Steve. Andrew's popularity dies along with Steve and he decides he's an apex predator and then goes on a violence spree. I suppose some of this parallels Akira, as was intended by the director.It was an interesting concept. Admittedly, I grew a bit bored of the kids doing their parlor tricks as the movie spends quite a bit of time on this. It's not a long movie, but something like half of this was spent on them discovering their powers and building upon it. The instant friendship between the three also seemed a bit hard to believe. I suppose all having a power like this would serve as a bonding mechanism, but Andrew is still very much unlike the other two so I found it hard to believe they'd be so close so quickly. It's a minor nitpick though.The movie ends with a fairly cringy scene, that I don't think was needed. I think we knew Matt was guilty for what he did. They also had a subplot with Matt developing a relationship with Casey, that really didn't go anywhere and was pretty much pointless. Maybe this was for a possible sequel?6/10. I can see how some would like this more, and I wanted to like it more, but it just didn't quite do it for me.",Chronicle
151,goods116,"Pretty good movie, would have been better without ""found camera""",7,15 February 2012,"I generally enjoyed the overall story in which teens get powers and we get to see how they use them and how it changes them. Not amazing, but interesting and many good scenes, especially in the last 15 minutes. However, the movie loses a rating point or two by the contrived ""found camera"" gimmick. It really makes no sense, no one would video tape their lives like they show in the film. By trying to squeeze the movie into this structure, I think the movie lost out on what could have been better character development and frankly better cinematography. Sometimes the movie was a bit hard to watch or simply awkward because they had to fit everything into this gimmick. It made more sense in movies like Blair Witch and Paranormal. I give this 6.5 to 7.0 stars which means cleanly above average, but certainly not an elite movie which would merit an 8.0+. With normal storytelling and a bit more character development (which would also mean a move more than 1:30 hours), this could have been GREAT.",Chronicle
152,jbacks3,Impressive battery life in that video camera...,3,18 February 2012,"Okay... here's what's wrong with Chronicle: 1) Urine-poor plot development, especially regarding contact with alien ""force."" C'mon, the entire episode is distilled down to exploring a hole in the ground. Chronicle makes alien contact almost boring. 2) Headache-inducing use of hand-held video cameras. We've all been Blair witched and Paranormal Activitied to death already (and wasn't there that gimmicky alien Godzilla-type thing a few years back too?). Please stop doing this crap! 3) The kid turns into an alpha predator without a lot of reason. Yes, his dad is a drunken jackass, but c'mon, his wife is dying! 4) There's one long weird pointless scene where the introspective philosophical kid knocks on a girl's door that goes nowhere. It should've been cut. It's useless and left me thinking the reason for it had been left on the editing room floor. The good: 1) The unknown actors are fine, but ill served by a shallow script. I liked the black kid who did a likable ""young Barrack Obama"" role, but his presence seemed a little too P.C., like a McDonald's commercial that hits every racial demographic. 2) Special effects are OK. Not terrific, but serviceable.Not a great movie by any means and clearly aimed at 15-17 year olds. I wish there would've been a product placement for whatever batteries were used in that camera...

This is a very ambitious entry in the documentary-style of films, and i think it's ambition and near-flawless execution puts it near the top of the heap. The ending leaves it open for a sequel.

154,chaz-28,Chronicle's exploration of telekinesis & its effects are a breath of fresh air to the superpower franchise,8,6 February 2012,"Telekinesis is one of the lesser discussed powers in movies about superheroes. Superman and the Jedi are telekinetic but to different degrees. Batman, Spiderman, and all of the Avengers are not telekinetic even though they each have their particular strengths. The high school kids in Chronicle spend the film discovering their new telekinetic powers and how to shape them to affect themselves and others around them. They fall somewhere in between Superman (not human, can fly in space, turn back time, etc) and the Jedi (who can move items with their mind but cannot fly).Andrew (Dane DeHaan) is the least popular senior in his Seattle area high school; he appears to be lower on the totem pole than the lowest freshman. He has a troubled home life where his mother suffers from terminal cancer and his alcoholic father (Michael Kelly) is ready to beat on him while drunk at 7:30 in the morning. He starts lugging around a video camera, which does nothing to help his social standing, and his only explanation is that he just feels like filming everything. His cousin Matt (Alex Russell) is also a senior in his class, drives Andrew to school every day, but is just fine ditching him at parties so Andrew doesn't cramp his style too much.It is at a party in an abandoned building where Andrew, Matt, and Steve (Michael B. Jordan) discover a hole in the ground and some sort of pulsing alien artifact which inexplicably transfers telekinetic abilities to the three high school kids. Steve just happens to be the most popular kid in school, is running for class President, and for once, Steve as the African-American is the rich kid with the supportive home life rather than his Caucasian counterparts. For the screenplay to specifically set it up that it is these three boys who find the hole and become powerful is a stretch but suspending disbelief for a moment is worth it to then follow them around as they test out and try to find the limits to their new gifts.Quickly, they learn they can move an object from here to there, stop an object's momentum or speed it up, make items levitate, and eventually, fly. Chronicle's effects are some of the best I have ever seen. Legos seamlessly stack themselves in mid-air, the omnipresent camera which Andrew conveniently lugs around gracefully floats around the room, and the physical forces upon the human body look realistic when they are thousands of feet in the air flying through clouds.The cinematography is set up as 'found footage'; think The Blair Witch Project and the Paranormal Activity franchise. Instead of one camera; however, Chronicle is edited with other cameras including a friend's video blog, security cameras, and third party observers and also has an extensive soundtrack full of songs in the background. It is not as much of a documentary feel as recent found footage movies and as for the steadiness of the camera, it falls between Cloverfield (somewhat nausea inducing) and Paranormal Activity (on a tripod).The director, Josh Trank, made a wise choice to go with unknown actors here. It helps the audience sink in with the found footage feeling because you will think to yourself, ""Hey, James Franco (or whomever) can fly."" These are just high school kids (perhaps a bit too old looking at times) who stumbled upon a hole in the ground. The reason Chronicle is so effective is not just because of the special effects, but because its story idea and screenplay are quite strong. I cannot think of another movie which focuses specifically on the telekinetic powers and its abilities and limitations. A film like Firestarter is limited in what the character can do and a film like Spiderman (which is similar in that a high school boy discovers he has powers) moves on quickly from the initial shock of discovery to fighting evil-doers who have also been zapped by some form of radiation.The Chronicle kids never get past that initial shock stage. They continuously call each other up and show their buddies what new skills they have unlocked. The possibilities of complete telekinetic power, as you can imagine, can go on for a long time. Interspersed throughout the script are scenes which touch on the philosophical implications of what these boys can do. Matt happens to be the philosopher of the bunch and casually name drops Schopenhauer, Plato's allegory of the cave, and the tragic failure of hubris. Andrew waxes philosophical later on but carries it towards a darker end of the spectrum (think Hobbes's Leviathan).Wrapping up Chronicle would be a challenging task for the strongest screenwriter and the movie eventually falls off the tracks and crashes through the plausibility barrier in the end. However, the first two-thirds of Chronicle are so strong and original that I can look past the sloppy ending and appreciate just how good this movie really is.",Chronicle
155,bdgill12,The Best Found-Footage Film Ever,8,15 February 2012,"Since The Blair Witch Project debuted in 1999, I have been intrigued by the concept of the found-footage film. Obviously I am not alone in that sentiment seeing as the genre has exploded over the last decade, resulting in a number of low-budget, low-quality films that consistently disappoint across the board. Still, however, I remain interested in the concept as a whole because I believe that, if it used correctly, the technique could lend itself to an outstanding film. Enter Chronicle.Andrew Detmer (Dane DeHaan) is your typical high school nobody. He is routinely bullied, his home life is a mess, and he has only one friend, Matt Garetty (Alex Russell), a cousin who he isn't really close to. As a defense mechanism, Andrew starts filming everything he does, earning the ire of just about everyone around him. At a party that Matt drags him to, Andrew is approached by the school's most popular student, Steve Montgomery (Michael B. Jordan), who asks him to bring his camera over to check out what he and Matt just discovered. What they find is a deep hole in the ground that brings them into contact with a foreign object that imbues the boys with special powers. As the film cuts from scene to scene, we see the trio learning more and more about their abilities, beginning with simple telekinesis tricks like stopping a baseball in midflight and moving up to flying high above the earth with ease. But as they grow stronger, Andrew becomes more powerful than both Matt and Steve and he begins to abuse his powers, prompting a cataclysmic confrontation in the streets of Seattle.Chronicle hits its projected target on just about every level. It is all at once a sci-fi thriller, a superhero origin story, and, possibly most importantly, a coming-of-age drama. Andrew, Matt, and Steve may be somewhat cliché but they embody their respective roles with ease and comfort. Their relationships, actions, and motivations are completely believable; they behave exactly the way you would expect three teenagers with brand new super powers to behave. These guys aren't immediately concerned with changing the world for the better or using their powers for good; instead, they compile numerous hand-held shots of pranks and hijinks, toss a football around at 20,000 feet, and enroll in the school's talent show. Meanwhile, though, Andrew's worldview becomes darker and darker, bringing the narrative back around to the concept at the core of virtually every superhero film: with great power comes great responsibility. Andrew is set up not as an evil character but rather a mere boy who can't handle the abilities he's been gifted along with the emotions of a troubled youth. That is an important difference that keeps Chronicle from becoming the standard good-versus-evil affair and brings more depth to the film than I might have expected going in.First-time director Josh Trank (rumored to be Marvel's choice to helm the Fantastic Four reboot) displays great talent but also great restraint. He meshes the teenage angst and drama beautifully with a score of high-quality special effects shots and sequences and never stretches his film too far. Chronicle is less than 90 minutes long and while I usually take that as a red flag, in this case it fits perfectly. Any longer and the film would have run out of steam. Instead, it finishes with a bang, an extended FX sequence that concludes exactly when and how it should. Moreover, Trank's film is perhaps the first of the genre to properly incorporate multiple viewpoints. Most of the found-footage is taken from Andrew's camera but throughout the film, Trank interweaves shots from several other sources, particularly in the final, explosive act.Above all else, I think what sets Chronicle apart from just about every entry from the genre is that it is a good, worthwhile story without the found-footage aspect. Rather than using the technique as a crutch to prop up a pointless story or to simply provide cheap scares, Trank and writer Max Landis crafted together an excellent film that just happens to use found-footage as its medium. Overall, Chronicle stands as a compelling and sometimes thrilling film that represents perhaps the very best the found-footage genre has ever had to offer.Please see my reviews at thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com",Chronicle
156,bennyhagen,"""Turn that thing off...""",1,14 May 2012,"Found footage is now a business model exclusively and this horrible thing makes it extremely obvious. Whole plot devices are crafted merely as an alibi for cameras being around in the most implausible situations to accidentally set up a perfect OTS shot. Being limited in telling a story, when everything needs to fit into a situation with some kind of camera around, the directors elegant solution of course is to convert 85% of the unimaginative dialog into exposition, spoon-feeding you the two dimensional, infantile melodrama, leaving 10% to explain the camera presence in some way and adding 5% of irritating bull crap that I guess the writers thought modern teenagers would say when behaving naturally.

The plot is so interesting and really has you wondering what's going on through the whole movie and with the fantastic character development and great friendship between the characters it really makes it so fresh and interesting. The emotion in this movie is what makes it feel so raw and authentic, the characters all go through such a character change and they all develop so much throughout the film and it's truly amazing that they can fit three well done characters arcs in one movie. It's such an interesting style of movie for a found footage movie as I really have never seen a super natural style thriller movie like this before.

159,StonedMagician,Great: 9.0,9,27 July 2019,"Especially for a low-budget debut film and screenplay, Chronicle blew me away. This is a film that can stand proudly among other genre giants. Complex and perceptive, Chronicle is a superhero film that seems proud to bend the rules of its genre and filmmaking style to suit its needs. Actually, more than anything, Chronicle is a psychological study, but more on that later. The characters (who aren't that different from anyone here) come first, and thankfully, all of them are very well-played by the young stars. Andrew, the main character, is a senior in high school who has a pretty bad life at first. Beaten by his father, bullied at school, and antisocial in nature, his cousin Matt and a camera are his only companions. He uses the latter to film his daily routine, such as watching a pep rally, going to school, and letting Matt drag him along to a party. It is at this point that (spoiling nothing)the duo and their mutual friend Steve happen upon a hole in the ground, put there by a large, seemingly alive crystalline object that disrupts the camera feed and gives them telekinesis. For the next thirty minutes, there follow some of the funniest pranks anyone with telekinesis could pull (scaring a little girl with a floating teddy bear, pushing a car into a different parking space, etc.) However, giving away as little as possible, one of the three (guess which) begins to slowly use his powers for not-as-amicable reasons, including, in one incredibly disturbing scene, levitating a spider and severing all its legs at once. Wow. However, the psychological aspect of the film is one that is almost creepily realistic, thanks in large part to the writer, Max Landis. The dialogue sounds almost exactly like what kids their age would actually say, as do their actions (brought to life with some great special effects). If you are in your late teens, it makes you wonder whether you would have used your power differently than the characters did. It is a great example of how, if one is pushed far enough fast enough, and is given the ability to deal with his problems in unimaginable ways, something will snap. And it does. It really does. The final forty minutes or so are dark, chilling, and bleak. Josh Trank uses the found footage concept to great effect, with the rare knowledge that there is usually more than one camera in an area at a time. Cell phone cameras, security footage, and Andrew's camera are used to maximum effect, and the telekinesis gives the director a great excuse to use conventional film techniques with digital photography. Combined with the sparse but convincing effects, it never brings you out of the story or the experience, and never feels cheesy or overdone. And interestingly, the tonal shift near the middle feels to me like a reflection of superhero movies themselves. Before the year 2000, they almost never took themselves seriously, and were all melodrama and light shows without much depth. But recently, films like Watchmen, The Dark Knight, and Iron Man have given us looks at the dark depths beyond the colorful exterior their protagonists hide behind. Prior to its release, I wanted this to be good, but just did not have the confidence that two industry rookies could do justice to the great ideas the film seemed to possess. I was glad to be proven wrong.",Chronicle
160,austin-takahashi,Chronicle Movie Review: 3.5 Stars,7,9 February 2012,"The three teenage heroes of ""Chronicle"" are strangely drawn to the baffling hole in the woods. From deep within this crater comes eerie sounds, and the little light that gleams from it is unexplained. In neglect of the human instinct of self-preservation, the boys jump right in. It wouldn't be unnatural to fear that these kids would end up injured, missing, or trapped, especially if you've seen too many episodes of Man vs. Wild. But what do you know? They not only survived their stunt, but also gained telekinetic superpowers as a result. Lucky bastards.""Chronicle"" adapts the idea of the Superhero Origin story and operates it within the immature and naive world of teenagers. The boys are grateful to have acquired their amazing abilities, but their nature doesn't lead them to save lives and fight crime. Heck, they're probably not even old enough to win a battle against their own hormones. The film's first half gives a depiction on what would happen if astonishing powers where granted to immature beings. Shoppers at malls become victims of telekinetic practical jokes. Leaf blowers are mentally activated in front of pretty girls with short skirts. The scenarios are small-scale and simple-minded, but they're also amusing and believable, and certainly more original and entertaining than most of the comic book movies of last year.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/chronicle-movie-review/",Chronicle

Three high school kids get super powers. They film a documentary of their wacky miss adventures, and of course one of them takes it too far. The plot is so paper thin it's ridiculous. I'm really trying hard not to spoiling it. Moving on to the acting. Andrew is superb at playing the abused, awkwardly shy high school kid. His performance while filming was a spot on interpretation of how a student film would be. The camera quality improves as his upgrades cameras which is a nice touch. It really gives a student film kind of feel to the movie. It's not glorious or perfect picture quality like a standard run of the mill Hollywood flicks we're used to, but that's what makes the movie stand out. However, aside from Andrew, the other characters were so dry and unoriginal that I completely forgot their names! Andrew's mother wasn't bad, but his father was just terrible. There were lines where I believe he just lost his train of thought. Overall, this film is mediocre at best.

Filmed in a typical found-footage style, this movie far surpasses all the rest and the points for that are pretty clear to me.First, very fine and credible characters, they are very well developed, situations are very real, this is filmed in a way that seems possible to happen and that's great for a found footage film.Second, the pace is very well managed, the little jokes between them slowly turning into something else and surely going into something darker.Third, The premise is quite simple but effective, 3 friends found a source for super powers,but, as the saying goes, with power comes greats responsibility, these guys doesn't seem to know it, or at least not all of them and this is a guaranteed descent into the subtle dark corners of the mind.It has a nice atmosphere, well developed characters, good first act, fine comedy parts in the second act and a brilliant and shocking third and final act.Simply put, this movie is brilliant, I really like it, but, some essential parts of Hollywood storytelling are not here, director and writer manage to get some courage and take a change with something different, usually this means that people will either love it or hate it.I'm the lover, if you feel yourself at rage in the first half of the movie, don't go on, you will hate it, if you, like me, manage to be amazed at the refreshing new style of the first half,please go on, you will love it, specially the end.This movie set the bar for found footage films.8 out of 10",Chronicle

I just don't like the shaking, and the shots present in these types of films. But then as I watched the film, I had my worries settled and found it to be an immensely entertaining sci-fi film.""Chronicle"" is a sci-fi film shot in a ""found footage"" style focusing on three teen guys: Andrew (a shy, unsociable, and unpopular guy), Matt (a normal guy), and Steve (some student who's into politics). One night in a party, they investigate a mysterious hole and encounter a mysterious crystal that grants them the powers of telekinesis and later on, flight.That's right, telekinesis (the ability to move objects mentally) and flight. These three guys then use their powers to their likings by committing pranks on people, creating the illusion of performing magic, and other activities for fun. However, one of the trio starts using his powers in a more dangerous scale and soon starts causing trouble.Let's get back to the ""found footage"" format. The reason why I love this movie is because its ""footage"" style is different than that of other films. By having the characters possess telekinetic abilities, this allows the scenes to be progress smoothly for most of the time. And sometimes, this makes the movie look as if it had been shot without the ""found footage"" style.The acting itself was satisfying. Introducing a group of unknown cast,we can discover new talents. The three leads are okay considering they aren't big yet in Hollywood. The rest of the cast were also fine and their performances are above average.Another reason why this movie is special is because of its running time. Running at just over 83 minutes, the film has a lot of content in it and most of the scenes are sensible and flow into the next ones smoothly. When I got up to leave the theater, I looked at my watch and was like ""What? That was only 83 minutes? That's very impressive!""""Chronicle"" is an entertaining sci-film shot using the ""found footage"" style and is very fun to watch. Considering its relatively low budget of $12 million, I have to say this movie is very impressive compared to many disappointing big-budgeted films. I definitely recommend this film to all you readers because this is just impressive.

It's realistic and the effects are superb; probably some of the best super power sequences I have seen in a while.Couple of downsides: I would have liked the ""abusive father"" stuff to have been less restrained and/or the mother and son scenes to be more poignant because I personally didn't ""quite"" believe one of the kids' motivation for the things he did; it was also weird that the cousin didn't really spend time with his aunt...I don't want to give too much away though.I also wasn't happy with the final scene. The ending itself was absolutely superb - I wasn't expecting it to be as massive as it was thinking their budget might prevent that but it was amazing. The very final scene though left me feeling like it wasn't necessary - but it didn't detract from anything that had gone before, it just meant I looked at my friend afterwards and said ""why?"" instead of ""wow!"".But we were both animatedly talking about how brilliant the film was for hours after and how glad we were that we watched it.One final thing; something happens in the film that I'm not going to spoil...but it was totally unnecessary and harsh - you will know when it happens.Best and most satisfying film I've seen in ages, 10/10",Chronicle

169,Marc_Action,Chronicle Deals With More Than The Supernatural,7,29 May 2012,"If you enjoyed the Heroes series on NBC those first two years it debuted back in 2006, then you'll love Chronicle. With that said, I guess you can also surmise that this film is not too original. And the problem with super hero movies and TV series like this is that it's hard to keep the material fresh and hard for writers to come up with plots that are even 70% believable. That was my concern with this film, the previews looked promising, but I also figured that much of the action that would take place in the film was mostly displayed in the 30 - 60 second previews. Well I was wrong. This film succeeded in holding my attention throughout the film and managed to be quite believable. Two of the things that make it believable is that it deals with deep, human physiological issues just as much as it does the supernatural powers that the filmmakers promoted. Director Josh Trank brilliantly shows (through actor Dane DeHaan's character) that such powers in the hands of a mentally-disturbed individual, or an individual with economic issues, can be a serious danger to society and self-destructive, even when that individual is not intent on doing so. And the second reason this film is believable: Chronicle does not have a happy ending. And I don't mean to come of as pessimistic but for me, that makes a movie more believable, because let's face it, in life sometimes we don't get a ""happy ever after"" ending. With that said, I will definitely recommend this movie. I rated it a 7 because I thought the special effects were a little elementary, but the content more than makes up for this flaw.",Chronicle
170,skullislandsurferdotcom,"A Bit Too Much, but Pretty Decent",6,6 February 2012,"Three teenage boys, after discovering a mysterious hole in the ground, acquire telekinetic powers. The main character, Andrew, the nerdiest of the group with a dying mother and abusive dad, is determined – even before the transformation – to film everything on his home video camera.The best scenes involve the trio first discovering their skills by lifting smaller objects around, performing miraculous tricks at the school's talent show, and eventually maneuvering vehicles: think if Sissy Spacek's CARRIE directed JACKASS.The reactions of the wizardly teens, playing God with the unaware dolts around them, is infectious – you'll wonder what they'll think of next. But when things kick up a few notches, and they begin flying around like teenage superheroes, it resembles a computerized mainstream motion picture, losing the spontaneous edge of the ""chronicling camera"" device.Here's where the characters get lost in the mix: especially after Andrew becomes a formidable villain that can't be stopped, resulting in an air battle you'd see in a video game. But as entertainment goes, this does entertain. It's too bad the film, like the characters therein, eventually takes its powers, and itself, way too far and far too seriously.For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com",Chronicle
171,byrann_gowan,An interesting take on the found footage and the Superhero genres,8,19 June 2012,"This film is about 3 high school students: The first is named Andrew, who's life is a living hell. His mother's sick, his father's a drunk, and he is constantly bullied at school. The second is Matt, Andrew's cousin, while the third is Steve, Andrew and Matt's friend. After making an incredible discovery, they start to develop superhero powers. However, when these powers start developing, their lives are turned upside-down, and things start to take a nasty turn for the worst.I want to start by saying that this is not the first found-footage movie that I've ever seen. The first was Project X. I'll admit that, while that film was stupid, it did acknowledge that it was stupid. Therefore, I knew what I was getting into, I kept an open mind, and for that, I enjoyed it. However, this film just rocks it out of the park. What Project X didn't have, Chronicle more than made up for. While Project X was a fun time, Chronicle had more of a story to it, so the actors had more to work with in this one.Speaking of the actors, they all were great here. Michael Kelly is the drunk father who just does not care for his son at all. Ashley Kinsaw is great as Casey, the girl who Matt has a thing for, and who, in the end, is the girl who sort of gets in the middle of it all. Then, we have our three stars: Michael B. Jordan, despite not getting as much screen time for reasons I will not mention, is still great. However, if there are two clear stars in the film, it is Alex Russell as Matt and Dale DeHaan as Andrew. Their interaction throughout the film is great, especially throughout the latter half of the film.Now, I know what you're thinking: if it's a superhero movie, it has to have two things: a) a bad guy; b) some sweet special effects. This movie has both. I won't mention who the bad guy is, but the special effects in this film are pretty sweet here. The hand-held camera technique adds to the special effects, in that it actually makes you feel like as if you're witnessing everything that's going on.Overall, a solid movie for me. It does arrive in the midst of a string of found footage films, but Chronicle is smart, well-written, and well-acted. A perfect 10/10 for me!",Chronicle
172,baumhenrik,"Refreshing new concept of a ""superhero"" movie",7,6 July 2019,"I liked the innovative approach of this movie. It's not about perfect super heroes but more about teenagers that have to deal with their new gained powers and just like Spider-Man said ""with great power comes great responsiblity"" or at least something like that. Of course this movie has some flaws but over all I enjoyed watching it. Would recommend to anyone who likes superpowers and dramatic stories.
Also this movie reminded me a little bit of 'Akira'.",Chronicle
173,DarthPaul85,Best case for live-action Akira so far...,7,9 February 2012,"My expectations were low...but after seeing it, I have to say I was very impressed. First of all, if you've seen the trailer (or Heroes, or any other superhero movie made in the last 3 years) you know exactly what's going to happen in this film. It's a stock story (""Akira"" meets ""Heroes""), it's been done, and the film knows this.What wins in this movie is the sincerity of its main character, and the relentless ""real world"" level of drama it maintains. It would've been very easy for this film to get melodramatic or stupid, and (for the most part) it does neither. This film works because we believe (and root for) the main character. He's a clichéd character for sure, but played earnestly.What's also great in this movie is the use of superpowers. (spoilers follow). It was a brilliant decision to give all three teens the same power, and see how each of them develops it. They use it how most real teenagers would; for fun. It definitely makes you wish you had telekinetic powers of your own. The movie definitely had weaknesses, though. First and foremost, the ""cinema verite"" style doesn't work. The whole point of doing a movie in that style is to make it feel authentic, uncut, raw, etc. For example, cloverfield worked because it felt like we were seeing government archive footage. Same goes for Blair Witch. But this film completely misses the point of those films. Here we have multiple cameras, cuts (like, traditional A/B style cutting), ""too-perfect"" framing, and no clear sense of who had this footage or how it was put together. We even see footage from cameras that have been destroyed while the tapes were still inside them. You could argue that realism wasn't the point, and it was a stylistic choice, but even then it fails because the filmmakers refused to leave out any important visual information (again, Cloverfield, blair witch) so it comes off as feeling shot by a filmmaker anyway. District 9 proved that you don't have to justify your camera being there ""in reality"" to do a film that feels like it's real. My only complaint about the actual story is that the main character makes some incredibly stupid decisions towards the end, clearly just to ""get the plot moving."" It's a real shame too, since there were many ways to get the guy from point A to B without dumbing him down. My last gripe is about the special effects. I have total respect for anyone willing to make an ""effect movie"" that's based on hand-held footage. However, when you're competing against cloverfield and district 9, well...this movie just feels like it was ""made in after effects.""So that's it! I may have gone on a bit about the movie's faults, but trust me when I say it's a well-made film. I hope the filmmakers for Akira take good notes on Chronicle, because this is almost exactly how it should be done (minus the hand-held camera gimmick).",Chronicle
174,jjnoahjames,"Chronicle = ""The Blair Witch Project"" mixed with prehistoric ""X-Men""",9,5 February 2012,One Word here Dane DeHann. He plays the troubled Andrew in this progressive film. He's made appearances in Law and Order but most notably he played Timbo in True Blood.Dane paints insanely emotional artwork here and in the end he tackles the big screen. Still I could feel his callow acting in the beginning (yet it could be that I just didn't like the character).Now don't let that ruin it for you he's good enough to make the movie work and this Leonardo DiCaprio twin (seriously take a second look) get's better as the movie goes on.Chronicle was worth it. I was bothered by the Blair Witch style camera shots at first but they get better as the movie goes on.There were some amazingly memorable scenes that makes this empathized X-Men drama feel 100% authentic.It's worth it just for that.,Chronicle

176,amichnea,Hated it... and I love superhero movies,1,22 May 2012,"First allow me to start by saying I wish I had my 1:42 hours back... Seeing how this had such good rating I decided to watch it, this was after watching The Avengers so you can imagine how disappointed I was with Chronicle.I hated the way the movie was filmed... only using 3rd parties cameras. This means any cameras around the heroes be it their own, someone else's, CCTV, News Cameras etc. Due to this reason the story will skip, so one day you see what you can because there is a camera around and then you skip a few days and you see something else. Bear in mind this is a very simple movie, nothing deep for you to understand. Even the way they got their powers is pretty lame.I grew up with comics so any superhero movie for me is a must see. I don't think I have seen any bad ones until this one. Sky High was 100 times better, I am number 4 which are rated below what Chronicle is. I am surprised how people can accept mediocrity and then praise it 7.1 stars at this moment on IMDb. There is nothing spectacular about this movie, there is no deep story and no the characters aren't cool or have any kind of personality, you don't feel anything towards them.I watched this movie with my wife and she kept telling me how bored she was, eventually falling asleep then waking up... until the end when she said WTF was that? What a waste of time. I dare you to take your kids to watch this and see their reaction:)) tell them it is a cool superhero movie.All I can say that this movie does show you one thing, how a socially retarded kids act when given enough power, in other movies becoming popular... or like the many stories in real life they get hold of some guns and then you get the idea. These guys are American high school kids... expect them to behave like that... when I watched Chronicle all I could think was ""what a bunch of idiots"". I guess this is the difference between a movie like Batman, Spiderman etc where you see the hero develop and take some responsibility for his gifts (with great power comes great responsibility). Don't expect any kind of responsibility in this movie.",Chronicle
177,theycallmemrglass,"The Superheroes genre gets a Highly Entertaining ""Found Footage"" treatment.",8,2 February 2012,"It was only a matter of time until we got a superpowers version of the ""found footage"" genre. Thankfully, we get a damn good one.This is a highly entertaining superhero ""origins"" movie which should delight fans of the genre. However, it does have a rather predictable storyline with quite a few clichés to boot. In fact, those of you who have seen the old classic film, Carrie, with Sissy Spacek, will notice the similarities in the storyline. Originality therefore, is not its strength. But its the whole execution of the film that completely wins me over. The dialogue was witty and engaging, and there was a delightful balance of humour, drama and very cool moments.Given that everything is meant to be captured on film by the on screen characters, a lot of liberties is taken with how every key moment is captured but it is cleverly explained and integrated neatly with the superpowers of the protagonists. So the effect of everything that unravels visually is creative, visceral and very entertaining.Even though I could see where this film is going, it was still compelling and that's mostly down to Dane Dehaan who plays the ""Carrie"" style character. He was superb. His performance of a troubled teenager gave the film more depth and realism than you would expect from an OTT high concept film like this. Michael B. Jordan provides a natural tone of comic relief while Alex Russel is suitably fine as the more rational leader of the 3 super power teenagers. The 3 leads played off each other well creating a complex chemistry in their relationships that ranges from juvenile foolery to mature responsibilities for each other's conflicting actions and use of their super powers.There is room for a sequel and as long as they can come up with a good story and try not to rip too much off other sources, I will happily be in the queue to see it.",Chronicle

181,Medacakathareal,A lot of fun!,7,4 February 2012,"I've been interested in Chronicle since the trailer emerged some time ago offering a glimpse at what seemed like a ""found footage"" film with a good story for once. Typically these sorts of films are like Paranormal Activity or Blair Witch Project, horror films done in handi-cam or surveillance footage as a gimmick to add credibility to a ""based on a true story"" marketing campaign and save money on real camera work.Chronicle on the other hand makes no attempt at pretending to be ACTUAL found footage and instead focuses on characters and that is it's strength. The tight focus of the film, following three high school seniors who gain telekinetic powers after finding a strange object in a cave, is what makes it so much fun. All three characters are fairly relatable and have consistent character traits. The film is seen through the eyes, or more accurately camera, of the protagonist Andrew. Andrew is not only the protagonist but thanks to his character arc he is also the antagonist. They couch this transformation in the idea of a tragic hero falling thanks to his hubris. Andrew's fall into darkness never grows too over-the-top or excessive and reminded me almost of a better told version of Anakin Skywalker (George Lucas could see this film and take notes).If I could describe this film in one word it would be FUN. It's exhilarating watching the three friends experiment with their powers, your ups are their ups and your downs are their downs.The film easiest to compare this to is Hancock and where Hancock started good and got increasingly more stupid as it's back story was explored Chronicle starts out ordinary and escalates to a satisfying, if not somewhat abrupt, climax. I could see a sequel with a bigger budget and better CGI easily being released as a summer blockbuster, or even see a spin-off TV series.Easily the best ""found footage"" handi-cam film I've ever seen, far from perfect but solid enough to earn a 7 out of 10.",Chronicle
182,victoryismineblast,Great story and effects make for quite a thrill ride,9,19 January 2014,"Chronicle uses the current found footage craze to great effect as it follows three high school seniors with totally different personalities who stumble upon an underground passage. What they discover there gives them supernatural powers, which they carefully hone and learn to control. Soon they can move objects with their minds and fly. These powers grow significantly, especially within Andrew, who is an outcast at school. He also has a dying mother and an abusive father.This does not play out like a superhero movie as Andrew decides on an unconventional method in order to gain the funds to pay for his mother's very expensive meds, which the family cannot afford. Eventually his rage spirals out of control until the people around him start paying the price.As far as found footage goes, this one is right up there with the likes of Cloverfield.

183,hi_im_manic,Impressive and surprisingly fresh,9,23 November 2012,"I want to kick myself for allowing this one to slip past my radar. It landed at Redbox early June yet it's taken me this long to find it, it's available in DVD and Blu-ray format. I'm so pleased that I finally did watch, for it was truly enjoyable and time well spent! Our three teenage leads present us with believable, solid performances. It's a treat to see fresh young faces (especially in this genre) command convincing roles, never was I reminded that they were ""actors"" playing a part. Clearly, they're talented and were granted well-written material and fine directing. The supporting cast did well enough in their mostly minor roles. The film focus' nearly exclusively on the three leads.In a market that's flooded with a deluge of found-footage and POV style films, Chronicle outshines and differentiates itself from others. Shaky camera and minor focusing difficulties are to be found for the first few minutes, but after they begin using a new camera and are bestowed with telekinetic powers, this effect is notably absent. By utilizing their new-found power, they are able to manipulate the camera into angles and capture footage in a way no POV/found footage film ever has. Indeed, meaning the camera operator can make the camera soar high and behind them, or encircle any activity smoothly. So no worries, your eyes wont be bouncing while you watch. I'm unfamiliar with all the production persons involved with this film. I must commend them for a job well done, especially on a tight budget. I begrudgingly use the term ""tight budget"", because no matter HOW much their budget was, they did an amazing job and the finished product is better than competitors with multi-million dollar budgets. The effects were spectacular and convincing, they dominate the film and are only rivaled by the compelling storyline.Some developments in the story are by-the-book predictable, certain events are inevitable. There weren't many surprises or unexpected twists for Me, but there were a few ""Oh holy hell?!?!"" moments that sufficed. I did laugh out loud at their superpower pranks.No matter the viewers age, the characters were relatable and realistic, as were their actions and plights. Nothing seemed unnatural nor cliché, and each of them were likable (abusive father and bullies excluded). The only character that seemed out of place was the blog girl / love interest of one of the leads. She comes into the story out of context and doesn't really contribute much to the plot. Altogether, this was a well planned and executed film that will far exceed the average viewers expectations. I'm looking forward to adding this fun film to My collection!",Chronicle
184,user-543-975655,Fascinating,8,31 August 2013,"This movie was riveting. Both visually, and emotionally, and almost every way else. Some pro movie directors go their whole lives without making a movie as good as this, and Josh Trank, this being only one of his successful movies, succeeded in making a very memorable movie. It started out on the lighter side, the boys using their powers for minor things, like building Legos or eating Pringles. This continued for a while, and made the movie fairly happy and fun. However, Andrew starts to slowly drift to the darker side, and the movie becomes much more serious. Andrew starts to strike back against his abusive father and tries to take better care of his increasingly sick mother. I hope that wasn't a spoiler, because it's one of the main plot points. Matt and Steve stay pleasant and happy, but Andrew easily loses his temper and starts to uses his powers for evil. THIS is what turned the movie to the very serious side. Halfway through the movie, Steve learns he can do amazing things like flying. I hope that wasn't a spoiler because it's on the cover of the DVD. The second half of the movie is also funny in some parts, but not as much as the first. I think I'll start reviewing the movie now. This movie was very realistic all the way through. The visual effects were absolutely outstanding. You would believe that this movie had a higher budget than $12,000,000. It's not as good as hero movies like the avengers or Th Incredible Hulk, but they were still awesome. The dialogue was also very realistic throughout the movie. In fact, my only complaint is the excessive usage of S*** throughout the movie. Maybe not excessive, but definitely not necessary. In fact, that's my only complaint about the movie. The storyline is a little out there, but don't you agree it has to be for this genre of film? It kind of needs to be. One example of the outstanding effects in the movie is a scene where Steve and Matt play football. Sounds normal, but you'll just have to see where they are playing. It will be awesome! The movie was great for a few reasons. It was a much needed twist on the genre, and had awesome special effects and it is gripping until the end. In many scenes, there are many action scenes that are very necessary throughout the film. But you'll have to see them yourself. The acting was also great throughout. It was very believable the whole time. People sounded hurt, happy, sad, and angry as if it was caught on tape. Yeah, that good. This film gets an 8/10 because it is very realistic, riveting, and very realistic, visual effects wise. My only complaint is the over usage the S-word. Anyway, it was a good movie, and would not mind getting it on DVD and adding it to my collection. Thanks for reading!",Chronicle
185,TheConnoisseurReviews,Chronicle Review,8,30 July 2012,"""Chronicle"" is shot in found footage format meaning they pieced together a bunch of random footage that they ""supposedly"" found. For the most part it is effective, but I couldn't help, but think that a more traditional take would have been as if not more effective. Sometimes I questioned why they were carrying around a camera, mostly during some of the more elaborate and dramatic moments. However, what they did was effective and gave a good style to the film.The film deals with the theme of being an outcast. The main character is abused throughout the early parts of the film and he holds back a lot of his temper, which blows out of proportion as the movie progresses. When he gets his powers he can't take it anymore. The movie is not only about not treating people that way, but also about controlling your temper. Also it deals with evolution and how certain people feel that they are superior when they have certain talents or abilities that no one else has.The acting and characters are all really good. Characters are very real, they don't put on tights and go fight crime when they get their powers. The guys mess around and see what is capable with their new found powers. They pull pranks and use it for their own benefit, much like most of us if we had powers. The acting is great and each lead has adds a level sophistication to their performance. A lot of emotions are present on their face and we can feel their humanity. I wish we had gotten more of their faces because that is were the heart and emotional connection is in the film.Overall, ""Chronicle"" is a really good movie. It shows us what one would really do if they had came across some super powers. There is a level of emotion present and the story builds up to a satisfying confrontation and conclusion. The found footage format doesn't always work, but the strong writing transcends the story to another level. I give it a solid 4/5, a faulty directing choice doesn't hold back the great writing and acting.""Muy Caliente""",Chronicle
186,ticket_for_one,Good Sci-Fi film with great performances,7,2 February 2012,"Good film. Akira meets Heroes. This film is about three high school kids. Matt your typical high school kid, Steve a jock or athlete running for class president and Andrew, the bully victim and laughing stock of his because of the obsession he has with his video camera. They hang out one night and find a hole in the ground which leads to an underground alien orb. Once they encounter the orb, they black out and wake with superhuman powers. All 3 have telekinetic abilities and at first use their powers for their own selfish gain. They soon find the responsibility of holding these powers is greater than they expected and Andrew in particular begins to explore his darker side and begins harbour the grudges he has. Really good film, I must say. Went into the theatre no knowing what to expect but I wasn't pleasantly surprised with Chronicle. The entire film is from a camcorder/video camera perspective. So in every scene one of the characters is always behind the camera in a scene. It's similar to Blair Witch with just better quality. Now this is something that's been done to death, but Chronicle somehow manages to make this interesting. Performances from the three boys were excellent.I felt that Dane DeHaan as Andrew in particular was outstanding. His character becomes unstable and if you watch the film you'll see how unstable he actually becomes. Alex Russell as Matt was great and did well to handle a lot of the humour the script has. Very funny as well showing he had the chops to handle the dramatic scenes. Michael B Jordan aka Wallace from the Wire, all grown up here does an equally great job as his cast mates, very funny as well as being charismatic. All three have great chemistry and I believed that their friendship was genuine. Special effects are awesome. Some of the effects you see in this will really impress you. Good dialogue between characters from a really good script. The only downsides about Chronicle are the sub stories. The story involving Andrew and his abusive father and Matt and his pretty girlfriend who also likes holding a video camera, slowed the film when it was just gathering momentum. Although Michael Kelly and Ashley Hinshaw do good jobs, their scenes drag film the down. Were they included to show we are dealing with real people? Probably! Also the end finale I found a little unoriginal and I was equally disappointed with the film's ending. Josh Trank is a young director and for his first feature film, he's done a good job. At times it has that student project feel to it, but the actors and the special effects quickly make you forget that. All in all I recommend you see Chronicle. Best thing out at the moment.",Chronicle
187,markdroulston,A shot in the arm for superhero origins,7,1 February 2012,"Ever since the breakout success of 1999's The Blair Witch Project, the found footage film has become a subgenre in its own right. In a similar vein to Blair Witch, the Paranormal Activity series has found great financial success with their comparatively meagre budgets, and Cloverfield in 2008 proved that, even on a larger scale, the handycam aesthetic can deliver effective thrills when employed by filmmakers who have a solid understanding of the style. Josh Trank's Chronicle represents an evolution of the found footage genre, taking the character as cameraman conceit to interesting new places, and marking the director as a young talent worth monitoring.Chronicle differs from predecessors like Cloverfield in the sense that this handycam footage isn't presented as 'found' per se, but rather is a stylistic and narrative choice which puts a refreshingly original spin on a well overdone story: the superhero origin. After encountering a strange, glowing object in a deep underground cave, high schoolers Andrew (Dane DeHaan), Matt (Alex Russell) and Steve (Michael B. Jordan) discover they have telekinetic powers which allow them to move objects with their mind. Matt considers the powers to be like a muscle, which can be strengthened through training, and after beginning small eventually the trio build superhuman strength and, to their delight, the ability to fly. The special effects betray a small budget at times, but the initial flying sequences are breathlessly entertaining, and the pure joy of the characters makes them more effective than most mega-budget blockbusters. These are meant to be regular kids, and although the story loses focus as the scale grows towards the climax, the early scenes are surprisingly genuine and affecting. But make no mistake, this is an origin story (one which doesn't necessarily beg for a sequel however), and Trank and his co-writer Max Landis (son of John Landis) use the visceral, in-your-face nature of the found footage to breathe life into a genre which has come dangerously close to wearing out its welcome in the past decade.As is the case with almost all science-fiction, a lot more can be read into Chronicle than what is happening on the surface. Aside from the excitement of fighting and flying about, there is a very real human story at work, with a lot of teenage life's triumphs and tragedies. Trank and Landis clearly poured their own experiences into the film, with the three leads seeming like people from everyone's high school years. Added to this is a nice element of self-reflexivity as Andrew, an unpopular misfit, uses his camera to define himself, and how he sees the world. The old adage about writing what you know seems to ring true in the case of Chronicle, and seeing Andrew learn to move his camera in more dynamic ways thanks to his new found powers is perhaps the tiniest hint of autobiography from Trank. The film is filled with subtle aspects such as this which will probably be missed by most, but thankfully simply taking Chronicle at face value is a rewarding experience, proving that the superhero origin story is not dead, it just needs a good shake up from time to time.tinribs27.wordpress.com",Chronicle
188,lleeric,Woah. This movie was so awesome.,10,1 March 2012,"Oh my gosh. This movie was so frigging awesome. Every single thing about this movie was great. I loved chronicle. It is one of the best found footage films i've seen in a very long time. Also one of the best superhero movies i've seen in a very long time. You should especially check this movie out in Imax because it kept me on the edge of my seat. It is about 3 high school boys. Andrew, Matt, and Steve. Andrew is the main focus in this movie and he films the whole movie. He get's bullied a lot and gets abused by his drunk father. He doesn't really like his life. This movie was also frigging hilarious. I love the scenes where they screw around and just do all these fun stuff. The special effects were superb and perfect. The performances were surprisingly very good by these kids. It was very interesting and made it seem very realistic how they filmed it. Also, the last 10 minutes of this movie will blow you away because it was so fantastic. Overall, i really enjoyed Chronicle and definitely the best movie of 2012 so far. Great year for movies so far. 10/10",Chronicle
189,saschakrieger,Adolescence with a Twist,7,26 March 2012,"Andrew is a teenager whose life attracts nobody's envy: He is an outsider at school, neither attractive nor popular, he has a dying mother and an abusive father who regularly beats him. He has no friends, except his cousin Matt who hangs with him more out of pity than sympathy, and has never been with a girl. He has no self-confidence and is constantly afraid of pretty much everything. Chronicle has all the ingredients of the usual troubled teen film which is a subgenre of the coming of age movie, often turning into a comedy with a happy ending in which the ""hero"" gets the girl. Or it may be the realistic variety in which the protagonist struggles against the odds but at least ends up a little wiser. Chronicle is none of these things. Instead, Josh Trank's directorial debut is a wild and thoroughly creative as well as entertaining mixture of coming of age drama, found footage film and superhero movie – genres that have little to nothing in common but are combined here in a strange but exciting and thoroughly original way.Since the sensational success of The Blair Witch Project 13 years ago, found footage has been a trend that has become increasingly stale. Chronicle revitalises this idea because it makes it serve the story and play a role in it itself. Andrew gets a camera with which he films his whole life, from waking up to going to bed. The camera is a wall behind which he can hide, a protective shield. The camera through which we see the film's story unfold is more than just a ploy, it is a way for Andrew to communicate and to avoid communication, a means enabling him to bear the hostile or at best uninterested world. As we see everything through its lense we are made to see what he sees in the way he sees hit. Andrew is characterised through what the camera shows us. There is no objectivity here, this is his world and it is not a pretty one. Chronicle is not the most colorful film, the Seattle it presents to the viewer is a cold, dark, grey place, desolate and rundown, a place that has seen its best days. Unlike most found footage films, the camera is not moved erratically and the images are not intentionally coarse- grained. Its use is as plausible and believable as it is unobtrusive. The found footage concept is not the star here.One day, Andrew, Matt and Matt's friend Steven find a hole into which they climb – against Andrew's will, of course. What they find is some mysterious structure which provides them with telekinetic powers. After they emerge and find out what happened, we watch them try out their new- found powers. They play and fool around with them as teenagers do – if the viewer buys the concepts, this feels totally real. It is the strongest part of the film as they test what they can do, train their powers and adapt to them as they grow stronger. Andrew is the best at this: His powers are the strongest and he can control and use them best. Finally, he has found something at which he is really good. His confidence grows and his anxieties recede allowing him to open up and begin to find out who he might be. The three become real friends as Andrew is no longer an angst-ridden teen. The super powers are little more than a tool, the means which make him transform into the person he had locked up inside. Steven encourages him to employ his powers in a positive way which, although briefly, earn Andrew the respect he has never known.But the danger is already lurking: Among the things Andrew had hidden inside is a massive anger that now has found a channel. The first time it emerges, Matt and Steven are shocked but they think they can get Andrew under control again. Unfortunately, things get worse in Andrew's life and the anger finds less and less resistance. The path to the dark and destructive side any power has if it is not matched by responsibility is laid out plain to see. Andrew, after all, is an immature teenager full of anger and hate. And while Matt becomes more mature and responsible through his power, Andrew seems to go the other way. The shift is plausible even though some of the plot twists are not.So the final chapter is a full-scale superhero battle with a long – too long – showdown that increasingly loses sight of the story and seems to indulge a little too much in effects. Whereas before the superhero plot served to highlight the internal struggles of the adolescent protagonists, it now takes over leading to a rather unsatisfactory ending which, at least, clears the way to a sequel – which apparently is already in the making.For most of its duration, though, Chronicle is a highly entertaining and completely original take on the very everyday fears and worries, hopes and dreams that come with that fragile time in which a child tries to turn into an adult. Chronicle turns out to be a surprisingly realistic portrait of a few kids growing up – with a twist that only highlights the real story being told. If only they had found a better way to end ithttp://stagescreen.wordpress.com",Chronicle
190,cablooie,"Overall entertaining, found footage with decent budget and good flow.",6,2 October 2012,"I had no idea about the nature of the story when I watched this movie.I found it entertaining and funny at times (where it was supposed to be so). The found footage style was not crucial and the hand held camera is annoying at times. It's not incredibly original, not exceptionally acted, not a milestone in the history of film making, but surely entertaining, better than expected and a good pop corn flick.Ending is wrong in my opinion (not the last seconds, I mean the last 10- 15 minutes), a bit OTT when things get amok, all in all I found it unnecessary to have all the messy destruction. The boy tossing coaches around and yell-disintegrating everything was rather ridiculous than terrible, not to mention the Matrix stolen scene where he stops bullets.Still I will give this a 7, mainly because of the first phase in which the main characters have and deliver fun exploring their new possibilities, a good way to get to know them as well.",Chronicle

And I really wanted to like this because it had a bullied kid get superpowers, but about 50 minutes in I got really annoyed that it still wasn't getting to anything that could be called ""the good part"" and I started skipping forward. Only to find that there is no good part. It's just a teenage wet dream of what getting superpowers would be like. Even the pathetic attempts at dramatism and creating a philosophical core are cringe-worthy at best.Just a waste of time, another IMDb score out of whack sending me on a wild goose chase.",Chronicle
192,jashezilla,Bring a fresh originality back to the superhero genre,9,23 September 2019,"Most people can't get past the found footage style that Chronicle is filmed in, but if you can you are in for one heck of a ride. Now the story is pretty generic, but the way it's told and shown to us is very unique and feels fresh. The twists are great, the characters are great, and the style is groundbreaking.",Chronicle
193,eatfirst,Smart and sprightly indie take on the superhero genre,6,30 December 2013,"A smart, indie-spirited superhero movie that asks the question (admittedly not for the first time), what would really happen if ordinary people developed superpowers, but handles the result with more wit and emotional punch than the premise might suggest.Three teenagers, after an unexplained encounter with something...well, something, find themselves in possession of some form of telekinetic ability which manifests mildly at first, and is the cause of much entertaining japery, but soon develops into something with far more alarming strength.The three leads all perform extremely well with what are largely archetypes; the bullied loner and the popular cool kid for example, and build an engaging relatable friendship that goes beyond high school movie cliché, even while the movie indulges in some of that genres most well-worn tropes (school hall bullies, problem fathers, trying to get laid at parties). What feels at first to be rather over-familiar works as an effective piece of audience wrong-footing, as the movie then makes a lurch into darker, more dramatic, and genuinely original territory.The conceit of all this playing out through selfie home video footage is a somewhat peculiar choice, becoming an unnecessary millstone to the production as the third act requires every police officer and bystander alike to be blessed with Roger Deakins levels of camera control. But this oddity aside, Chronicle is a breeze. Moving from charming hi-jinx to an efficiently devastating finale in less running time than it takes for Bilbo to get all those dwarfs out of the kitchen.",Chronicle
194,bassrourke,Check this out NOW,7,2 February 2012,"No spoilers here so all good you can keep reading, however my advice is go see Chronicle as soon as you can before anyone tells you what happens or even part of the story-line. Luckily the trailers do not give too much away except three mates in high school obtain magical powers after discovering a weird hole in the ground. Thats all I'll say other than its awesome, different and when one of them goes ballistic, Armageddon is nigh. Filmed in handy-cam style like CLOVERFEILD, BLAIR WITCH, DISTRICT 9, this is outrageous stuff. Beautiful and talented, Ash Hinshaw & Anna Wood are the prominent females in the cast, but its all about the boys, unknowns now but after CHRONICLE, exposure will be immediate. Must See.",Chronicle
195,jackharding89-1,Akira meets Cloverfield in this super indie smash...,9,9 April 2012,"Marmite. Garlic. Brussels Sprouts. Don't worry, you're in the right place; this is a film review. Why the hell has it began with a list of disgusting foods- you ask? Well, that's the point. To many, they're actually delicious. Even sprouts. You simply either love 'em or hate 'em which, consequently, brings us to Chronicle. First-time director Josh Trank's low-budget sci-fi spectacle that bolts itself to the vexed Blair Witch-ish notion of ""real"" documented footage. The reasons to love this kind of style are actually reasons to hate; raw, course and tangible filmmaking that blends truth with trickery. Sucking the viewer into the plot whether they like it or not, spitting them out at the end all shaken and stirred. While some revel in the tremulous, hand-held realism conjured by the cast and crew, others detest; dismissing the concept-cum-gimmick as mere nauseating crap. Example? Cloverfield. Another? Paranormal Activity. One more? Troll Hunter. Chronicle, then, will enthral just as many as it'll appal. Given the ultimate success of certain hand-held films across a range of genres, it was only a matter of time before someone had a go at a superhero flick in a docudrama disguise. Trank's directorial debut chronicles the events of three high school friends who gain telekinetic-like superpowers after stumbling across a mysterious crystal-like-thing. Soon, though, they find their lives spiralling out of control as the cameraman and would-be baddie of the trio starts to embrace his darker side. In an era where we're documenting our every thought, mood and action, updating our Facebook status' and flushing all sorts of crap down Youtube, anybody can chronicle their day-to-day life, anybody can make a movie. It also appears that any production company can put up the cash to pretend to make a low-budget, indie film. With its sterile, static twitching camera concept and staggering effects, Chronicle falls somewhere in-between the three. It's a product of its time; an immersive and enjoyable experience blaring with cinematic shock and awe with humour to spare. The everyman acting of the unknown cast instills enough empathy and flat-out realism to make the super power servings palatable. Chronicle all but makes the unbelievable believable. A rare feat, indeed, in modern-day fantasy film obtained only by the likes of Christopher Nolan and the cream of the discovered footage crop. Yes, teens do play pranks, bend metal and move cars with their minds and take to the skies from time to time. Our main character's subjection to domestic abuse and high-school bullying along with his terminally ill mother and punch-drunk dad brings Chronicle crashing down to earth, though. But not for long. Trank counteracts this dark subtext by ramping up the voltage and the laughs, the fireworks and the fantasy. His Chronicle is ambitious, immersive, subversive and boasts a barnstorming finale redolent of Akira. And like the seminal Anime classic, Chronicle is a revelation. Yes, it requires a certain predilection for found footage filmmaking, but it's hard not to marvel at the enterprise of such a well executed concept.The fact little effort went into a lofty viral marketing campaign (or any sort of campaign for that matter) means Chronicle won't reap the initial hype and profits obtained by the likes of Cloverfield at the box-office. Which doesn't make much sense given the film's demo-graph. But with its pending DVD/Blu Ray release, sales and idle talk should sky-rocket in Josh Trank's favour. Whatever happens, Chronicle looks set to be a cult hit and possible catalyst to a league of sequels and spin-offs (which may not be a good thing).Anyway, the last thing I want to do is to encourage you to see a film you may not like, but seldom do you see a mainstream-friendly film this engaging; this pioneering. It's absolutely brilliant and like all great movies, Chronicle is a rousing and fresh fusion of cinematic prowess and high-quality entertainment that breathes new life into a genre. Forget The Hunger Games. This is the new and exciting sci-fi saga we deserve. See it.",Chronicle
196,uttiyo-sarkar56,Unreal!,8,28 April 2012,"Entertaining, Visually Stunning, Fast-Paced and Well Directed and acted, Chronicle is a superb sci-fi movie which is very fast paced, precise and to the point with stunning visually effects and great acting and is what it is much due to the excellent work by Director/Writer Josh Trank who has done a great job in making one of the most unique movies of the year.The Story is about 3 friends, Andrew, Steve and Matt who are socially awkward or nerds who make a discovery in a cave which gives them super- human powers or telekinisis which at first they have fun with but as the movie goes on Andrew becomes obsessed with the power he has and goes dark during the course of the movie, which proves to be havoc for the city he lives in and his friends.The Acting by the young cast is superb and they have precisely done all of their respective roles very well, and its good to see a movie without a big star being such a fine movie. Dane DeHaan specially has done a solid job in the role of Andrew, who is a tricky character to play and he has really justified the character with a great performance, and also Alex Russell has done a fine job in portraying Matt, the cousin of Andrew who also becomes a super-human with him and makes a special bonding while the time.The Direction of this kind of a fast-paced, visually stunning movie is really superb by director Josh Trank, knowing the fact that the movie was displayed on a Hand-Held video camera, and he has also done a great job in guiding these young actors to perfect their roles, and also a great job in utilizing the great and unique story which is also partly written by him greatly by making one of the best sci-fi movies of the year and definitely an entertaining one which will keep the audience glued to their seats.The Visual Effects in the movie are simply stunning and some of the scenes shown such as they clouds in which they are flying and more are superb and great effort from the visual team to make this extremely delightful visual effects. The Story written by both Josh Trank and Max Landis is quite unique and great showing how the obsession of power can make a simple nerd do all the wrong things. Landis has also done a good job with the screenplay of the movie.Finally, this movie is definitely one of the best of 2012, and great visual effects, acting and direction along with a gripping and entertaining story will surely ensure the audience to really love this movie and watch it without any hesitation.My Rating: 7.5/10",Chronicle
197,ivern-326-711636,A Very Special Kind of Found Footage Movie,8,1 June 2012,"Three teenagers, Andrew, Matt and Steve make a big discovery in the woods when they find an ancient artifact that gives them telepathic powers. ALL CAUGHT ON TAPE!Chronicle is very special type of Found Footage movie. I've always liked the Found Footage genre, ever since I saw Troll Hunter. They're a good way of adding more realism to for example horror movies or thrillers. Now, Chronicle is very different from the usual type of found footage like Cloverfield and Troll Hunter. This one centers around superheroes in real life, pretty much. Unlike those movies also, Chronicle is shot through multiple cameras. Throughout the film, especially the last 30 minutes, the film switches from camera to camera. It's shot through everything from from security cameras to mobile phones. It's pretty genius, actually.The characters are very likable, and the main character Andrew is very tragic, but relatable. His cousin Matt is also a good character and the third character, Steve, is also great. The movie really captures the feel of imagining if you had superpowers, and used them to impress the people around you.There are very few things wrong about Chronicle. The only thing I personally didn't like was the change from funny to dramatic. It isn't really a flaw, and it's good that they made it that way, but I personally liked the parts were they were doing pranks on people more.Overall, Chronicle is a really good movie. Great characters, a great story and great use of the found footage style makes it an overall great movie.",Chronicle
198,Josh_The_Third,"traumatic & violent, just for the sake of it",6,10 June 2012,"First off, let me kill all your ""realistic"" arguments. The characters get super powers and start doing a lot of stuff that even a 13 old would not find believable since there is no real back story or explanation to it. Occasionally you think ""ooh I guess they're going to explain that now"", but that kinda thing never happens. Instead, you get a lot of violence, so, alright, you think ""wow that's bad, guess that issue will get solved"" but no, violence is the only answer and entertainment here, it just doesn't stop until you give up on humanity and movie makers.That's actually where the movie succeeds: at showing how society and even the characters themselves, are actually all powerless because they can't avoid their fate, just like we couldn't freaking' avoid this violent empty shell of a movie!Look, what i'm trying to say is that nothing here gets solved. The main character has issues, and movies are about solving such issues, and non of that really happens here. The epilogue is a joke. Its half-a-movie by far, with tons of trauma and violence and for what? that's right, for nothing really.",Chronicle

I felt as if I was back in high school again and I shared the coming out story of the jock meeting the nerds and having a great time. I certainly hope there will be a follow up movie. I hate films with the shaky found footage effect but this was done in an unabusive method. The only part i didn't quite understand was with them doing these wondrous feats in public and no one saying anything as they fly away from the supermarket. I enjoyed the way the story was told and the villain emerging from true pain of death and embarrassment. I was hoping for a longer story and ending was cool but a bit brief. This movie is a great change from the usual super hero story because it wasn't. It was more of a coming of age story about three boys with special abilities. I can see a sequel coming with the same actors coming back. Great movie to see and own.,Chronicle
200,FFman-847-460126,Great New Twist on Superhero Movies,8,4 February 2012,"Enjoy trolling? Enjoy watching people get trolled? Here's your movie. Chronicle stumbled into theaters thoroughly undervalued. Although it does have its flaws, it has paved an entirely new route in the worn-out genre of superheroes. Chronicle brings all the major superhero questions into play—Where did our powers come from? How should we use our powers? In the end, however, those questions are irrelevant. This movie is not about three superheroes. It is about three teenage boys who just happen to have super powers.This movie is quite extraordinary. All three of the main actors are unknowns. When the movie begins, they all promise to me stereotyped high schoolers—the popular one, the outcast, and the stoner. As the movie progresses, those stereotypes become worthless. These actors were up to the challenge. Each main character changes so much that you won't recognize them from beginning to end. Mix this with the unique storyline and this movie has an extremely strong core.A good deal of this movie is enjoyable simple because it is realistic to life. The bullying is brutal. The type of things that the main characters do with their powers is exactly what I would do. That's the shining point of this movie. It is true to life. It doesn't cover up life or try to smooth it over with simplifications. This movie is beautiful with its honesty. It allows the viewer to laugh hysterically one moment and cringe the next.The problems are minor but still present. The incredible climax is followed up with a lackluster conclusion. The father's character is rather over-the-top. I can't tell if it was the writing or the acting that made it so. These two facts won't pull you away from enjoying the movie. It's just too bad that such a good movie would end on such a low note.This movie is worth seeing. Some people will have trouble watching it in theaters because it is a shot from the first person and can be jerky at times. If you are okay with that, I would recommend seeing it in the theatre. I saw this movie with a large audience—which appeared to add to the experience. For the average Joe, this will be an enjoyable movie. For the superhero fan, this could be a cult classic.reillyreviews.wordpress.com",Chronicle
201,kdorsey321,Excellente,9,7 February 2012,"Checked out the movie ""Chronicle,"" starring Dane DeHaan, Alex Russell, and Michael B. Jordan(The Wire).

These are kind of my type of movies so I was more than happy to give it a shot.This movie was a breath of fresh air! It was cool, fun, funny, and the plot was original. The plot of this movie is not predictable, which is a great thing, but the story does have some things that we as movie fans are familiar with. I liked this movie a whole lot! I think this was a flat out great film! I felt like they did a great job in picking Andrew(Dane DeHaan). When the viewers are watching any antagonist, the antagonist has to give you a certain amount of ruthlessness that makes you feel the character in a unique way and Dane DeHaan does a great job of that playing Andrew. I felt like Andrew's character was pivotal in this film.I also like how real it felt. Even though there are clearly fictional things going on in this movie, this film still gave you a real feel that you can't deny.I'm giving this movie a 9 out of 10! I feel like this was a great film and a film that was needed in its genre. This movie has a very good acting, very good plot, and excellent execution!

203,MC1-Bjornson,Chronicled Well . . .,9,27 March 2012,"Chronicle"", Rated ""PG-13"" for Adult Situations, Adult Language, Adult Humor, Some Sexual Innuendo, Strong Violence, Some Gore. Running Time: 1hr&23mns.My Take: ***1/2 (Out of ****) // 9/10 on the IMDb Scale There are some people who absolutely detest ""the camcorder movie."" That's understandable. These types of films don't have the same mass appeal as the summer popcorn blockbusters do. However, I do believe these films ultimately do find their audience.""The camcorder movie"" is also known as the ""found footage"" movie. Basically, these are films purporting to be the faithful and accurate depictions of actual events as they had unfolded. The characters in these pictures chronicle everything with their video cameras. Good examples would be the supposed lost NASA archival footage of ""Apollo 18"" (2011) or the supposed discovered camera of the ill-fated college students of the witch-in-the woods creep-fest ""The Blair Witch Project"" (1999). The actors in these movies are usually unknowns to aid in their believability as the ordinary people they portray. The sound fluctuates and the image is usually grainy to appear as actual stock footage, right down to framing and dust on the film if required for the medium.It is necessary to establish this before going right into my review of ""Chronicle"" and for the context in which I have graded this picture. This is a movie intentionally designed to appear being pieced together from multiple video camera footage, cellular telephone videos, a surveillance video and a live news broadcast feed.""Chronical"" starts off simplistic enough. The film opens with Andrew Detmer (Dane DeHaan, ""True Blood""), a socially awkward teen, videotaping his abusive alcoholic father pounding on his bedroom door. At first you think this is a defensive tactic to ward off the father, but we soon realize there's more to Andrew's need to videotape the moments in life. His camera now goes everywhere he goes as he documents his world. He doesn't fit in at school and his loving mother is dying of cancer.Andrew's cousin Matt Garetty (Alex Russell, ""Almost Kings"") has been absent for a while. He likes to quote Plato and is asking deep questions. Matt and Andrew link up and attend a rave outside of Seattle. That's when popular Steve Montgomery (Michael B. Jordan, ""Red Tails""), who's running for class president, enlists Andrew's aid in taking some video of the mysterious cavern in the woods and what is inside.After the trio is exposed to a glowing crystal in the cave, they develop telekinetic abilities. That is, they are able to move objects with their minds. At first this is a novelty to them. It's good for hijinks with a hacky-sack and skipping rocks on a lake. They discover telekinesis is also fun to play pranks at school and at a shopping mall. The moments in the parking lot and the toy store are some of the funniest I've seen in a movie this year. The part with the young girl with the teddy bear had me laughing out loud.After theorizing the use of their powers is like ""flexing a muscle,"" the three friends broaden their abilities into flight. The footage of them playing football in the clouds together is what you'd expect newly super-powered youths to do in real life. To them their new found powers are the means to goof off and have a little fun. Sadly, as is often the case, absolute power corrupts absolutely. Not everyone can possess super-human abilities and keep their tempers in check. For those who can do so, it might have something to do with moral re-armament and their upbringing.This first 50 minutes of ""Chronicle"" are an absolute delight. The three friends act just like ordinary high school kids would act as they test their new powers. The problems they face and their good humor comes across as real making this film feel like a legitimate home video. Even when the extraordinary happens to these guys, they still act as teens probably would act in this kind of situation. There's an authenticity throughout the picture that really makes everything feel believable and true. This includes Matt's courtship of the cute Casey (Ashley Hinsaw, ""Gossip Girl"") to the extraordinary show-down in downtown Seattle toward the climax of the picture.DeHaan is terrific as the shunned Andrew, whose problems at home and school are universal. Andrew's repressed anger issues are to be expected. He is sweet and reserved until his personal demons get the better of him. What starts off as an unassuming movie with good cheer turns a very dark page. Though this transition seems a little abrupt, it also makes sense. The last act plays out well.""Chronicle"" has the ingredients of a comic book origin story, though the filmmakers wisely decide to keep this movie in the real world as much as possible. The overall effect is one of sincerity. Some will argue that ""the camcorder/found footage"" approach in this film's story telling is a gimmick. Maybe it is, but so what? In this case, it helps make ""Chronicle"" work.""Chronicle"" is written by Max Landis, who is the son of filmmaker John Landis. It's evident that he has a firm understanding in writing teen dialog and making lines that seem nonsensical come across as real and true. All of the characters are genuine.I can only review ""Chronicle"" in the context of what it is: ""the camcorder/found footage"" picture. For those who don't care for this kind of picture, there is no talking to you. That's fine and I respect where you're coming from.

I have been waiting for an unnatural accident or encounter that would infuse me with super human abilities since i was four years old. If your the same you will enjoy this unassuming story.Its fun and surprisingly good to spite a little bit of plot predictability like the character Andrew Detmer (Dane DeHaan).There are flying scenes that are very satisfying and convincing - special effects that contrast the low budget feel of the production.

207,ChipperX,The Terrible Cost Of Power,10,7 July 2014,"If you were virtually limitless, what would you do? If you had the strength of one hundred men, would you use it to help others - or would you harm them, instead? These are seemingly simple yet complex philosophical questions director Josh Trank attempts to answer in the 2012 movie Chronicle.When three friends encounter what appears to be an alien artifact in an underground cave, they gradually develop telekinetic abilities. As they experiment with their new-found power, they become geometrically stronger and more skilled. Their super-human abilities change their fundamental realities, blurring the lines between right and wrong.Dane DeHaan plays Andrew Detmer, a high school outcast with a physically and emotionally abusive father. Alex Russell plays Matt Garetty, Andrew's popular cousin. Michael B. Jordan plays Steve Montgomery, who is currently running for school president. The director fleshes out a complex social interaction between the three characters based upon their backgrounds, social standing and morals - or lack thereof.The movie is very successful in its approach: All of the action is viewed through the scope of Andrew's video camera. Through this sometimes-shaky lens we are treated to slices of Andrew's life. We begin to understand and sympathize with him as he is bullied, beaten and abused by his father and by his classmates. We are sad when we are shown his mother, who is terminally ill - she loves him unconditionally, second only to his cousin, Matt.The true crux of the film lies in the character study of Andrew and his disassociation from society. With so few allies to support him, director Josh Trank choreographs with frightening clarity Andy's descent into utter madness as his telekinetic powers grow to epic proportions.This film is well-worth the watch for its commentary on the price of teen-aged angst, alienation and its effects on the human soul. You will also enjoy the special effects and the surprising strength of love. The ending may not shock you, but it may make you think twice about what it means to be human.Chipper F.

208,rajivness,A must see superhero movie sort of similar to Kickass and Super,10,28 April 2012,"i absolutely loved this movie! this is one of those movies you can keep watching over n over- while continuing to enjoy it even on the 2nd, 3rd, 4th view.the movie is about 3 high school students who develop telekinetic super powers on exposure to an alien meteor (glowing technicolor crystal). what follows is harmless pranks to malevolent actions by Andrew to the point where Andrew develops a God complex and begins to look at people as insects. he kinda goes apeshit at that point and goes berserk - causing property destruction that makes Hancock look like a boy scout.The part of the movie that doesn't make sense or I consider unnecessary is the video camera element. The movie isn't shot as a docu-drama like paranormal activity or cloverfield - where we're seeing footage thats found after the fact. Andrew is a film director wannabe with a camera fetish and just wants to shoot (film) everything for no rhyme or reason - kinda random.That aside, the movie is basically a 'What IF' movie. What would you do - if you developed super powers? Would you use the powers responsibly? Would you use the powers for the greater good or for your own personal (selfish) reasons? I can relate completely to a lot that transpires. Thats the magic of this movie. You can relate to it. You can see yourself doing everything these guys do as they learn more about their abilities and as their abilities develop.This movie is similar to Star Trek Nemesis - where Captain Picard is faced with a clone, albeit a younger version of himself - who is nothing like him because of the hard life he's (the clone) lived. Picard asks Data if he might go down the same dark path if he had had a similar life. In Chronicle, Andrew's cousin is like the Good version with Andrew being the 'bad guy'. Andrew is the bad guy because he's had a hard life and has always been considered a loser, is a loner and has had no luck with girls at all. He's a social Pariah. People pick on him in the school hallway, girls ignore him like the plague and he's the kind of person who's watching the world from the shadows.This is a must watch movie for anyone who likes superhero movies including wannabe superhero movies like Kickass and Super - which are more comedic than action - but are amazing to watch over n over.",Chronicle
209,xcitenlady,Horrible waste of time and money,4,21 February 2012,"I am not sure if I was in the same movie the other viewers were in viewing this movie.It never provided the reasoning behind how and why they received the power; sure teenagers are daring but to go into an ""unknown content"" black hole and move around is unheard of.As the movie proceeds it becomes more and more predictable...the effects, as usual Hollywood thinks that the average movie goer just needs a great effect and that makes the movie good...not in this case.....I was so tired of seeing the flying and leaping and such....the actions with no meaning for the action and the usual 3 guys or girls who meet all the diversity criteria to please the audience....but no real substance to the characters.....and the ending well it leaves very very much to be desired for...but for the ones that think its good, the ending is an indication there will be a Chronicle II....",Chronicle
210,Junreviews,The movie that contains a hidden message for bullies and offenders,8,10 December 2012,"When is the last time you watched a movie without any background music? The Chronicle is a documentary film where the majority of scenes are recorded by a camera. It shows how well each scene is depicted and edited while arousing curiosity about what is going to happen ahead within two hours. Despite filming it with zero musics, the intensity can be felt as if you are the main character filming the entire sequence. The plot starts off with an innocent teenager, Andrew, trying to submit a video for the competition gradually turning into a cynical outcast after finding out how invincible he can be with the mysterious power he gains from a giant crystal. The conflict between Andrew and two of his friends, Matt and Steve, who also get the equivalent superpower is intriguing as they try to suppress the turmoil that is caused by Andrew's abusive behavior and infinite desire. The continuity is smooth without repetitions and the complexity. Types of superpowers that they possess simply consist of levitating which becomes flying as time goes by, Telekinesis, controlling any objects regardless the weight. Visual Effect deserves a huge credit for making them look real.So why I do I think this movie sends a message to the bullies? From my perspective, the motive of Andrew for becoming evil-minded comes from his agony and rage that originated from getting consistently bullied by his classmates and drunk father. By unleashing the formidable superpower that enables him to retaliate, the director subliminally tries to tell us that bullying or provoking someone can negatively impact anyone. As this movie also reflects the typical life of high school where Andrew performs in the talent show using the superpowers to brag ""New Andrew"" to students looks probably a little cheesy and unreal but it is an effective way to express the true colors of human beings. How their attitude towards Andrew changes because of his unique ability that differentiates him from his classmates. To sum it up, it is a decent and different movie depends on how you see it. I would have given a perfect score if they had added brief expositions for the origin of the superpower. How did the crystal land on the earth? Why do they have nose bleeds every time they use the power? Or it is better for the questions to be remained unknown?",Chronicle
211,BornKnight,A Sci-Fi Drama of a teenager with Telecinetic Powers and a Troublesome Life,8,2 May 2012,"""Chronicle"" (2012) tells the story of a adolescent, Andrew, who is socially excluded at school, besides being an introvert personalty, and serious problems at home with the aggressive alcoholic father and his mother, who is dying of terminal cancer.He still enjoys the company of his cousin, Alex, and at a party, he and another friend, Michell, find in a nearby cave a meteorite that give them powers of telekinesis, which are discovered little by little ...Initially the jokes with the use of these powers were funny, but they begin to take another course, and the situations of Andrew's life ultimately influence his control (and uses) over these powers.The film has a very good visual, with convincing effects, extremely well made that does not transpire much use of CG. Also just taking a different approach, because Andrew, early in the film uses a hand-held camera to film the assaults of his father, and the camera ends up being the main perspective by which the film is shown, until the final half hour.The performances are very good, particularly Dane DeHaan (Andrew) that clearly shows the psychological chaos in his life and that culminates with the final events shown in the end.The audio of the movie is nice, with effects and music very good and appropriate to the film.There are some comparisons to Akira, and yes, it resembles it - but what that involves psychic powers that does not refer to the Manga or Carrie's, somehow?Anyway, the movie ends up having a very good approach to what the conditions of life a person could do with their mind, and what would happen if by chance, this person had powers - of course, in a common sense much in the film ends up being driven to a adolescent target public, but even so, the focus is very good, and it is enjoyable for older people.A great choice for a science fiction - drama movie, with a different theme to what we are accustomed. My score: 8.4 / 10.0.",Chronicle
212,bardia-moose,"One of the better ""found footage"" films out there.",7,23 September 2014,"This movie makes me excited for Josh Trank's future projects because his work is unique and surprisingly redeemable. Dane DeHaan delivered a stellar performance, which was much needed because of the distractingly poor CGI. I was not bothered by the ""found footage"" aspect at all, and believed that it helped me learn more about Andrew's character as I could see the world from his perspective. The filmaking style also enhanced the suspense/horror aspect of the movie. Apart from a rushed conclusion, Chronicle was a nice surprise that is definitely worth checking out, especially if you are a fan of sci-fi and superhero movies.",Chronicle

214,Glock_Boy,A disappointed optimist,4,29 June 2012,"I'm an optimist. The reviews for this movie were all over the place. I wanted to believe the good ones. I was hoping the plethora of bad reviews were just lame attempts to drive the rating score down. I was wrong.The premise was intriguing to me, even if it wasn't original. But the execution failed on several levels.The characters were not likable. They were just hormonal idiots. That's the fatal flaw. The nonsensical ways these fools use their new powers just makes you shake your head.Imagine you have these new powers and abilities. What would you do with that? Think about all of the great things you could accomplish. Instead we are lead down a road of violence and murder. The screen writing was weak. A great premise wasted.Here's a question for you: You need money because your mom is dying. You have super powers of levitation and strength. Do you: A. Grab some ATMs and get the money you need or, B. Rob a convenience store and get shot?I hate movies that have promise that deliver so very little. In this case, I did not get my $1.25 value from this movie rental.",Chronicle
215,Schnayblay,An Incredibly Unique Genre Film With a Lot More Than You'd Think...,8,8 June 2012,"""Chronicle"" was a film I was excited to see from the minute I heard the premise. I'm a big fan of the found footage craze, and when I heard this was going to be a superhero film rather than a typical cinema-verite horror film, I was psyched. But what I didn't know was what a well-made movie I was going to watch.The story of ""Chronicle"" is about an 18 year old guy named Andrew Detmer. He doesn't have the best of lives. His mom's dying due to cancer, his father is abusive, and he has no friends at school other than his cousin Matt. One night, Matt, Andrew and on of Matt's friends, Steve, discover a cave. Inside, they find a strange object that gives them telekinetic powers. They use these powers for fun at first, but eventually, tensions rise and the three boys friendships are put to the test. For such a simple premise, you're going to find a lot of character development in ""Chronicle"".As soon as the movie starts, you already sympathize with Andrew. He has no human connections, really, so he starts filming everything in his life. I think it's a thing we've all thought about. Maybe not filming our whole lives, but at least a day or two, and playing off that I think was really smart. We all like to think our lives would make good stories, so given Andrew's sudden decision to do this, don't find it weird if you have the desire to start filming your life suddenly.Dane DeHaan did a great job of portraying Andrew. You really love this guy, you can feel his frustrations, and while the things he does toward the end of the movie are just brutal, you can still understand his reasons. I don't think it's a spoiler that he goes psycho. You can tell that just from the trailer. But when it happens, you're so involved in his character, you feel something; a connection to him. No matter how many terrible things he does, you really want to see him turn good again.There's a scene where Andrew is in the hospital, and his father goes on a monologue about how Andrew's mom just died because his father was out looking for him. He blames Andrew for her death, and is literally about to hit him, when Andrew wakes up. You know at this moment, things are about to get serious. It feels a lot like Anakin Skywalker; how he lost his mother, and then turned evil. But this connection you feel to Andrew really gives you mixed emotions. You know you're supposed to be routing against him, but you've grown to love this character, and even though it's wrong, you don't want Andrew to be stopped, because you're just hoping he'll come to his senses. That's what you call deep and thought-provoking writing.That's another thing I have to mention. The writing is great. Max Landis and Josh Trank did a great job at making likable characters, great comedy, and tension. Max Landis is the son of John Landis, the director of ""The Blues Brothers"". I have to say, I'm very happy to see such a different style of writing come from this lineage. This movie feels like something you and your college buddies thought up of one night at 2:00 in the morning. It's such a simple concept, but it evolves into a great film.I should probably talk about the other characters. Michael B. Jordan plays Steve, a very popular, well-loved kid from school. After gaining their powers, he becomes very close friends with Matt and Andrew. Besides Andrew, he's my favourite character. He's very positive, always in a good mood, and he's really funny. There isn't a whole lot to say about him, but you love him from start to finish.Then there's Matt, played by Alex Russell. Here's where the cliché hero comes into the film. Matt is a boring, uninteresting character who you don't give two cares about. It feels like Russell was trying to do his best Superman. He's the upstanding, always do right guy who just drags down the teen fun of this film. There are parts where you like him, but especially towards the end, you're going to be so sick of him.The action in this film is jaw-dropping. The whole film builds up to the final battle with Andrew and Matt fighting one another, with all of Seattle as their battlefield. They wreck everything: buildings, signs, cars, helicopters. It's complete and total mayhem at the hands of one kid, and you're going to be exclaiming from awe every 10 seconds. For a film with such a relatively small budget, I found the action in this to blow my mind and excite me more than in most Hollywood blockbusters.In the end, I loved ""Chronicle"". I can easily see this becoming a cult movie that fanboys will still be watching in 20 years.It's one of the most original and unique films I've seen in a while. I like the simple premise, I love the characters, I love the style and story. I just enjoyed every aspect of it. I definitely say watch it. If you enjoy any of the elements of film that I've described, you are probably going to have a lot of fun with ""Chronicle"".",Chronicle
216,markphilo,Nicely put together,9,12 June 2018,"I not normally a fan of hand camera movies a la Blair Witch and Cloverfield, neither of which I liked, so going into this movie with its shooting style wasn't going to win me over.Except it did. It was compellin, well acted and I could see myself following a very similar path to the main characters.A flick through the reviews you can see people love or hate it. This is surely down to the handicam shooting. I would like to have seen it as a traditional shooting style.Either way, this is definitely worth a watch .",Chronicle
217,Shakor77,Don't understand what all the fuss is about,2,8 May 2012,"This game got good reviews for some reason but I really can't see why. The story makes little sense, even in the context of a super-hero/sci-fi setting, and the first half of the movie is about a bunch of teenagers and their usual issues at school except of course they got some sort of super powers...And the ending is nothing sort of craptacural, over the top and just ridiculous. Also the movie is filmed like Blairwitch Project, i.e. with a hand-camera and that was cool, back then, but now it is just not original anymore.So unless you are a teenager dreaming of having super powers, this movie is poorly filmed, poorly written and just plain silly.",Chronicle
218,geodrake-71-627198,A decent try but falls short of the mark.,5,10 February 2012,"Chronicle is almost a good movie. The plot revolves around three adolescent guys (two of whom, Andrew and Matt, are cousins) who develop superpowers after encountering an extra terrestrial object that I like to imagine is a fragment of the planet Krypton. Strangely they only use their powers (including flying) to lark around; none of them decides to become a superhero. Andrew (Dane DeHaan), the social outcast of the group, utilises his new skills to gain acceptance from his peers in school. This starts off well but leads to his humiliation at a party. On top of the abuse from his Father, his Mother's illness and the family being unable to afford her meds pushes Andrew over the edge and leads to a spectacular showdown with Matt (Alex Russell) as they battle across Seattle. Sadly, somewhere along the line, the screenwriters decided to film most of the action as if captured by Andrew's hand-held camera. The amateur footage gimmick has been flogged like a dead horse by movie makers; it's no longer innovative, shocking, or convincing enough to appeal to savvy audiences. Director Josh Trank must have found that not all the plot was filmable from Andrew's point of view, because during the film, especially at the final battle, the shots swap to footage from other cameras, e.g. Police surveillance tapes. Which begs the question why the pushed ahead with the idea in the first place. You find yourself longing for conventional filming after about five minutes. Special effects are decent, apart from some of the flying scenes, where it is painfully obvious from the way the actor's bodies are positioned that they're on wires. A scene where Andrew uses his power to pull a spider apart is impressive though. DeHaan's believable as Andrew, portraying his angst and growing hatred of the world in a convincing manner. Russell and Michael B. Jordan who plays the third gifted teen give capable performances with the material they're given. To conclude, Chronicle is worth watching if you have some time on your hands, but don't go out of your way to see it.",Chronicle
219,ernesto-garcia,A Genuine Review of Chronicle,9,28 January 2013,"Chronicle is a 2012 action POV film. Chronicle begins by showing us the hard life of Andrew, an outcast senior as he gets ready for school. Personally I am tired of all the POV, but I always love it when something fresh is brought to the screen. This film makes the audience connect and sympathize with Andrew and when he is happy so are you, when he is hurt so are you.I love the 3 main characters and I think they did an above average job.If I had one problem with the film it would be that the progression of Andrew as he goes from bad to worse is a little to fast and he hurts his friends for no reason.The Film is excellent and deserves to be watched time and time again.Watch this flick if you like POV, or if you like deep,complex characters with a rich interesting take on a superhero movie. If you don't like POV films this is not as bad as others but it still might make you sick. 3.5/4",Chronicle
220,jackstarr777,An inventive and thrilling film with a fantastic final act,9,13 July 2012,"As the film starts, as with most found-footage films, we gain an understanding of the characters. Here, we see that the protagonist is shy, and bullied, and weak, and we sympathise with him. But, as soon as things get interesting, we forget nearly all that.As the teens start experimenting with their powers, we find it fun and intriguing. As each one is revealed, we get more excited and more interested. Unfortunately, though, after the first act things get a little tiresome and uninteresting. During this period, I was tempted to give it a seven.But, the final act seriously packs a hell of a punch, and by the end, I wanted to give it a 10. The inventive methods of cinematography are dazzling, the effects are good and it is totally unpredictable and packs many emotional punches. You'll leave feeling thrilled and inspired, guaranteed.8.7/10",Chronicle
221,jeffrey-utley,"My Favorite ""Found Footage"" Movie",8,18 July 2013,"Now that ""found footage"" movies have their own genre thanks to the 'Paranormal Activity' franchise, we'll be seeing more than only ""found footage"" horror movies. I think this was the first non-horror ""found footage"" movie, it was a drama, sci-fi and thriller movie. It did well at what it shot for.I am not very fond of the ""found footage"" genre, because the element just lowered the quality of the movie, when it was supposed to make the viewer get the feeling that it's real. In this movie, the ""found footage"" element did of course bring down the quality, but it also kind of did make the movie seem real. The main character's dad abused him and I thought that it was really awful, because it seemed real. He was also tormented by kids at school, which wasn't as bad, but it still seemed bad. ""Found footage"" movies always have a low budget, so the CGI in this movie was low quality, and easy to tell that it's fake. It's also very easy to tell when there's a green screen... But I didn't let those things ruin the movie, because it was still cool.The part when the three guys got the powers was much more intense and much cooler than I thought it would be. I expected them to find a kind of big and strange rock that gives them powers. I didn't expect them to go down into a deep, dark hole and find a huge, strange living thing inside of a big glass surrounding. I also didn't expect it to push them back and out of the hole, which was very cool. The way they were all linked was something that fit well into the story and played a good part. It wasn't exactly necessary, but it worked in the story and I thought it was a good idea. I liked how it showed that the connection was extreme when one of the other guys would do something extreme. The sounds would be louder and the nose bleeds would be worse. It was good that they demonstrated that in the movie.I thought the acting was good, and the writing made them seem like high school seniors. They messed around and had comedic conversations that made me think that they really seemed like they were in high school. They all-around acted like and even looked like they were high school seniors.Anyway, here's the movie as a whole. I very much enjoyed it all the way through and had a good time with it. It wasn't too slow in the beginning and didn't take too long for them to get their powers. It shows everything they can do with their powers, but they used about an hour of the movie to show it. I know that it has to be realistic, but it took us so long to find out how everything they can do. It showed them moving things with their mind and messing with people (it was pretty funny), which was cool, but for a lot of it that was all they did. It eventually showed them flying, which got old after a while, but it was cool in the beginning. I do like how it shows that the longer they have their powers, the more and better things they can do with them. Anyway, as it goes on things with the main character happen and he starts killing people and starts to lose it. Since it had the ""real"" element to it, that part seemed awful.Now we have the end. It was big and very cool, but it went on forever. Andrew, the main character, is basically tearing up the city and killing so many people, and it is very cool. His cousin (who also has the powers) is trying to get him to snap out of it, but he won't stop it. He is going crazy and fighting with cousin. It's almost like they can't die with their powers, so the movie has things knocking them down and electrocuting them and having things done to them that would kill a normal human being, but it doesn't kill them... So it gets old after a while, but not long after it gets old Andrew dies and the ending goes downhill from their.Despite the stupid things about the ending, it was very entertaining and when I watched I was on the edge of my seat, it was awesome. The rest of the movie was kind of slow and had bad CGI, but it had the ""real"" factor to it and it was very cool and enjoyable. My 8/10 rating of ""Chronicle"" means that it is really good. I probably won't buy this movie, but I recommend it to anyone who is thinking about possibly watching it.",Chronicle

WOWIt started weird with a high school group who seem to get beat on by everyone and one geeky kid who is playing with his movie camera making us watch through that shaky ""realistic"" footage we are all tired of. This group of awfully silly giggly teenage boys climb down a hole to find a glowing rock wall that gives them telekinesis. They discover they have gained powers, so they juggle candy and Lego's and when they get more powerful they scoot a car in a parking lot so the owner has to goto a different space to find it again, giggling and cooing all the while. It never occurs to them having powers like this is a life changing event, that the rock they discovered is an immense power of some kind. They just continue to giggle and play hokey stupid five year old pranks until one of them pushes a rednecks truck off the road with his mind. After almost killing the poor redneck it FINALLY OCCURS to them they may need some RULEs to help self control their super powers. Really ? All those stellar reviews must have been writ by dopey teenagers who would love to clean their rooms by just looking at them.We shut this mess off. Way too childish and silly for a sci fi lover. It was such an incredibly stupid and simple minded screen play, it actually became painful to watch. I have always agreed with movies ratings on IMDb and this was a 7.2 when I reviewed it.

Sure it had had some positive reviews, but how good could another 84 minute teen movie really be? Well, I couldn't have been more wrong. Chronicle is an excellent piece of film-making that is not only entertaining and very well made for such a low budget, but also has a message, something not one of these 'Found Footage' films (read: Blair Witch Project, Cloverfield, etc.) has ever had. It portrays what can happen to people when they are suddenly given a lot of power, be it political power or super power, and manages to bring that message across very powerfully in just 84 minutes. This is one of the few 'short-n-sweet' films that feels like nothing is skipped, like the story is told perfectly within those 84 minutes, and at the end it just feels like it's done, complete. 9/10.

225,chaugnurfaugn-269-83012,Cloverfield without Godzilla and the feel of reality,7,16 June 2012,"The benefit of the found footage genre, and one that director Josh Trank exploits here to the absolute limit of the envelope, is that where special effects and CGI look cheesy on a big budget they look impressive and expensive on a small one. Wobbly angles, quick cut-aways as the action explodes and vague, indistinct long shots combine well. The photo-realism of the hand held camera juxtaposed with the kind of jaw-dropping FX once the sole reserve of James Cameron really make Chronicle a movie worth watching.Unfortunately the story is nothing new, nor complex in its execution. Akira did it better and with more pathos, atmosphere and originality back in the early 90s. It's a new spin on an old idea, but brings the concept to a new audience, which is never a bad thing. It doesn't deliver in terms of depth but the shallow fun to be had before things escalate to apocalyptic levels is certainly and undeniably entertaining.A sequel would be interesting, if not compulsory.",Chronicle
226,myungjahigh,"hero, antihero, villain",8,14 March 2012,"Chronicle is not a movie focused on heroes or their superpowers. It is not a story of awesome heroes such as Superman, Batman, Ironman. The characters who have powers here never say that they will save the world with the powers.Andrew, Matt, Steve are very normal high school students. After acquiring superpowers, they just concentrate on trying them to put up some lego blocks, move a car, and so on. How ordinary it is. If I suddenly get superpower, I would take a remote control from little distance and watch TV, instead of swearing I will be a hero. This is what I like about Chronicle. It is certainly different from other superhero movies. I felt something congenial to the characters, which I have never felt when I watched superheroes. Camera effects of the films did make me feel that more. It looks real, so I could focus on it better. I like this kind of fake documentary..Chronicle does not have very splendid, amazing story in it. However it is still a good movie. it makes people see superheroes in a different way. Even if one got a superpower, not everyone can live as in movies.

Usually they take it to far or sometimes it's so blurry or so shaky you can't get the right feel for the movie. Like V/H/S(totally frustrated me).That being said Chronicle is nothing like any cam movie out there. They actually use a camera that has some quality and it's not shaky at all. I loved the plot and the mundane-ness of it all. I mean when I get superpowers saving the world would defiantly be the last thing on my list of ""Things To Do"". They do what normal teens would do if they get telekinesis: pick on people in Wal-Mart, scare little children, move cars so old ladies freak out when they find their cars are not where they parked them. And a little bit of revenge now and then. ""But with great power comes great responsibility"", and we learn that in the end when our ""Nerd"" freaks out and almost destroys half of Seattle in his ""nobody ever cared"" episode and then his best friend (his cousin I think) has to put an end to him. It would be awesome if they made a sequel to this movie. The ending defiantly gave way for a sequel.So yeah I gave it a ten out of ten, because it's really a pretty amazing movie that I would defiantly recommend to every person who was a fan of Cloverfield and such.One of my favorite movies of 2012 by far....",Chronicle
228,UnknownRealmsDotNet,Why was this made as a 'found-footage' film?,6,22 July 2012,"While not a bad film, Chronicle isn't the groundbreaking event that it is trying to be. If you aren't a teenager, or if you have even an interest in stories from other countries, you'll see beyond the surface of Chronicle. But first, lets get to the good stuff. The climactic sequence is pretty cool. It is very reminiscent of Akira (both the manga and the film), and the use of found-footage makes for a great montage of sources to bring that action to life. That said, however, the rest of the film plods along with a story that is manufactured for teens, fails to have any conflict, and is really nothing more than a origin story for a comic-book villain. The thing is all of this has been done before, and done much better. Unbreakable (origin story, which actually had conflict, and an arc to the story). Akira (some REAL mind-manipulation). Blair Witch Project, Cloverfield (found-footage that actually served the story). And I'm not really sure why they made this movie as a found-footage film. It really didn't enhance the film in any way. It was actually distracting. Because I was constantly aware that this was supposed to be a camera floating around.

229,bcbell79,"Chronicle is a fresh take on the Super-Hero and ""found footage"" genre. I loved it.",9,7 February 2012,"Chronicle led the Box Office this past weekend, pulling in $22 million. Not bad considering this film's meager $12 million budget! Directed by the virtually unknown 27-year old Josh Trank, it is an uncommonly well put together 'found footage' film.Trank, who also wrote, produced and directed the surprisingly good 2007 TV mini-series Kill Point, co-wrote the story for Chronicle with Max Landis (who wrote the screenplay and happens to be the son of Director John Landis). The film is shot primarily in first person. One of the three main characters, Andrew (Dane DeHaan) uses his newfound super-hero like power of telekinesis to also hover the camera around himself to document his (and his two friends) new powers. This alleviates the ever so annoying shaky cam that plagues most first person or 'found footage' movies of late. It also allows you to get to know his character once he masters this ability, but I am getting ahead of myself...Chronicle opens with Andrew (DeHaan)- a high school misfit with an alcoholic abusive father who films everything with his camcorder- and his popular cousin Matt (Alex Russell). The two attend school and eventually going to a Rave out in the woods. This is where we meet Matt's best friend Steve (played charismatically by Michael B. Jordan), who found a hole with a mysterious object in the ground. The three boys go in to investigate the object, and this is where things start to get really fun.The three boys quickly discover that they can now move and control things with their minds by simply thinking about it (with varying degrees of success). This film does a great job showing what teenage boys would likely do if suddenly given super powers, from playing pranks and trying to fly, to getting emotional and hurting people.The three characters are great, each boy handling their newfound powers differently. Soon they are flying through the sky, beating up bullies, and lifting cars...all with just their minds. And that's all before one of them starts to loose self control, which has violent, destructive consequences.I have wanted to see this movie since I first saw this trailer many months back. I have to say, as cool as the trailer was, I wasn't expecting too much from the actual film. Was I ever surprised! Chronicle is such a fun, fresh movie with entertaining characters and some great action and effect sequences. With that said, the effects aren't perfect, but they never hinder the story or take you out of the film. And sometimes (the end sequence especially!) they are fantastic.If you can get on board with the 'found footage' concept, Chronicle will entertain and surprise you. If you like super-hero movies, it's a must see (you are in for a real treat!). This is an exciting movie that is totally worth the price of admission, and deserves watching on your favorite local big screen.",Chronicle
230,cnitinb,An entertaining footage that brings back pride to the genre.,7,6 February 2012,"'Found Footage' genre of movies have existed since the 80's but not since the famous 'paranormal activity' in 2007 has it gained so much popularity. In 2008 , there was movie called 'Cloverfield' that combined this genre with the monster-disaster genre. It was surprisingly a delicious blend and went on to become a huge hit that year. It was the ideal version of 'godzilla' that Roland Emmerich's dud(1998) never even came close to. Chronicle is one such 'footage' movie that adds depth and realism that one doesn't normally come to expect from a 'super- power' science fiction film. The result is a satisfying thriller that manages to entertain thoroughly.Director Josh Trank's Chronicle is a story about a socially awkward teenager Andrew and his encounter with a mysterious underground artifact, along with two others, his cousin Matt and Steve. This twist of fate leaves the trio with Telekinetic powers-the ability to move around objects with the power of mind. From here on the first half of the movie is a joy to watch as they hone their skills , discover new traits and just have fun like a bunch of youngsters are supposed to when they realize sky is their limit, quite literally. The film takes a predictable darker tone when the obvious happens, one of them breaks the 'uncle Ben' code- ""With great power comes great responsibility"" and havoc breaks loose. In terms of the plot there is absolutely nothing new. It is basically Stephen kings 'Carrie' with all guys and the entire city replacing the infamous prom-in-gymnasium scenario. But it's the footage angle and earnest performances from a rather unknown cast that adds all the freshness required. The stunning visual effects and clever use of familiar camera-recording-like video is a winning combo that will leave you surprised to see even the routine 'levitating object' effect. The action and explosion sequences are a treat to watch despite the shaky camera feel. Perhaps the realistic effect masks expectations but nevertheless it all works in the favor of the film's tone and there isn't a single dull moment. Some feel the 'found footage' genre is being overdone and misused and they have a long list of films to prove that. In fact the paranormal activity series, no matter how much moolah they are raking, has lost its charm. But every once in a while a movie like 'the chronicle' comes along to remind filmmakers the 'uncle-Ben' code when it comes to using the shaky camera-work and hey it comes with cool visual effects too. Kudos!",Chronicle

For all though's people that on reading their review... and myself quite fancying the look of this movie, I'm certain i will not pay to see a film at the cinema again for a long while! After The Grey(which i reviewed last week) was as poor as this but in a different way! my cinema trips have went down hill somewhat drastically.Anyone that has seen Cloverfield, Quarenteen or any other cam held by the actors style movies this one will only encourage you to avoid future viewings (though i did enjoy Quarenteen) this one has an old premise of superman powers that fall into the wrong hands and gets darker as it goes along, only to end up with you hating the supposed hero's and having no sympathy for what happens to them.If you've seen Heroes on TV you've seen this movie only with less character building and more enthusiasm for the credits.

With a movie, don't judge it by it's trailer, and I fell for that... a little. The trailer looks good, and after all, these teenage boys did great acting, but what mattered was the story. Besides the acting, all powers were cool, but I still think it's a 7, If you read this review, don't fall for others.

233,skyminster,"If Boys Will Be Boys, Working On This Basis, Can Boys Not Be Boys?",8,13 October 2016,"Back in 2012, a year with all sorts of crazy blockbusters including Skyfall, Avengers Assemble, The Hunger Games, The Dark Knight Rises, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey and The Amazing Spider-Man (wowzerz, and the list goes on), this particular film came around from beneath people's noses with all kinds of shaky cam blazing and became somewhat of a hit. A lot of great films came out in that year, much more than we've been graced with in 2016, and I never managed to watch Chronicle until today, a thriller that mildly impressed a good portion of movie watchers. I, too, was mildly impressed.It follows the story of three high school students, Andrew Detmer, Matt Garetty and Steve Montgomery in Seattle who gain telekinetic superpowers after exploring a mysterious underground cave on a night out. The three something-teens are brought together into an unlikely friendship, linking the shy and odd Andrew with the popular and outgoing Steve as they have unimaginable fun with their ridiculous abilities. However, when Andrew embraces his dark side with his powers, things start to spiral out of control and their friendship is tested (to the max).It all starts when Andrew (the main character of the movie) begins filming everything in his life with his camera, and he is dragged into a party that eventually leads to the excitable exploration of said mysterious underground cave where weird shizzle happens and they come out being able to control the movement of objects without touching them – including, eventually, themselves, in a sense, as they fly around the joint. The problem is with the plot is, in the first half-an-hour or so, everything is a bit slow, and a bit boring. I'm not gonna lie, I didn't think the film was going to be that great when Andrew was slowly perving on cheer girls and walking around a bit. Even so, we get to learn more about Andrew, Matt and Steve as the film goes through this slow progression, and so although enjoyment factor is greatly crappified, the character development is given good time to grow.Chronicle's gradual and frankly boring progression, however, is followed by a (mostly) thrilling and fast-paced hour or so of sinister and bloody friendship tests, as the film introduces itself to a much higher entertainment medium. Things go from fun and goofy to dark and edgy (THE EDGE IS FINE) in the flick of a switch around the half- hour mark when Andrew uses his powers to hospitalize some bloke in a truck.With it's shaky camera-work and dark undertones, Chronicle, I'd say, is a pretty cool film. Its found footage cinematography and its use of interesting premise help it to reach 'pretty cool' heights, along with its silent score and anti-protagonist Andrew. I'd call him that because he's a douche, but he's the guy who gets the most screen- time (like a protagonist) and I felt sorry for him because he sort of became a douche because of his long suffering at school and at home.Something that is great about Chronicle is that it is completely honest, and there are no smoothed edges by the giant sandpaper in L.A; the fact it is means that the characters' actions can be easily relatable, and the dialogue, school bullying and action sequences can be fittingly brutal — which in turn means the film has the power to control your emotions as the viewer, because everything you see you can believe. However, the trolling by the teenage trio when they first obtain their powers is fun, but doesn't utilize that aforementioned ability to give you these emotions, because unfortunately I wasn't pushed to hysterics. There is also a slightly tacked on romance (of sorts) between Matt and some girl, which I didn't care much about, and there is a slightly lacklustre ending.Even so, the more sinister and violent side of the film is immense, as the bloody climax is thrilling, and not at all overblown like one of Marvel's shiny-fests. I got over the fact that it got a bit ridiculous towards the end, because it was more intense than anything I've seen in a while, and the cool factor was pushed to awesome with all the super-charged explosions and telekinetic terrorism. Andrew changed from a weird kid in some corner to a demi- god from the timid start to the explosive finish, and that progression saw the incredible climax it needed. The other two of the three super-powered mates also saw fantastic character development through the run-time, as Micheal B. Jordan and the bunch put across believable and genuine performances, and were helped by a brutally honest script (get that sandpaper away from me, Zak Snyder!).Chronicle is also a film that gets you thinking. It's not just a few teenagers flying around. The dark side's vicious admission makes you question the human soul and underlines how easy it is for someone to turn on their conscience, whilst also reminding you of the power of friendship and all dat. I apologize for the rubbishy analytical turn this review took. Let's go back to basics.Chronicle isn't perfect, but it manages to push its flaws aside. It totally redeems itself with its brilliantly intense atmosphere, relatable characters and brutal realism on show, all delivered through unique camera-work and nailed down with a solid premise.",Chronicle
234,JimSpy,A Pleasant Surprise,7,27 July 2012,"I have to admit to being pleasantly surprised at the quality of ""Chronicle."" As soon as I read that it was another ""found footage"" movie, I was ready to dismiss it. Glad that I didn't. It's the best of the genre, way better than ""Paranormal Activity"" or ""Cloverfield"" (and let's not even mention ""Blair Witch""). For starters, there's none of the nauseating ""camera shaking"" meant to remind you that an amateur is filming. (Don't we go to movies to see PROFESSIONAL camera work? Otherwise I'll watch my family's old home movies from trips to Europe!) And the acting is really quite superb - you nod your head and say, yeah, that's exactly how today's teens would act in these circumstances. There are some exquisitely done special effects, probably nothing ground-breaking, but a couple of ""how'd they do that"" moments. And there is welcome departure from some worn-out movie clichés. All in all, two thumbs up. And don't be surprised if there's a ""Chronicle II.""",Chronicle
235,The_creator2010,Chronicle is a clever tale of an aftermath encounter with a telekinesis energy,7,16 May 2012,"Chronicle is the latest movie to be released in relation to the newly born genre,Found footage.We have had a monopoly of found footage movie releases over the years. The Blaire witch project might be the only one that deserves a positive mention. Its vintage concept came about back in 1999 when it gave us something fresh and paved the way for a not so great future...""Apollo 18"", ""Cloverfield"", ""Quarantine"" and not forgetting the awful release of ""The Devil Inside Me"".Chronicle follows the lives of Andrew, Steve and Matt who find themselves trapped in a life changing experience when they encounter a strange hole containing a strong alien like energy. Their everyday ability becomes abnormal when they find their encounter the night before has left them with telekinesis strength.It is from there on that Andrews desire to video tape life's events might actuality make sense as he begins to film the development of their newly found superpowers. Things spiral out of control quickly as both Steve and Matt start to doubt Andrews consistency as he begins to take certain matters into his own hands, leading to serious consequences and uneasy attention.The scenes consist of clever camera tricks, involving moving cars, floating objects and bullying the public, all out of boredom leading to sheer enjoyment. Chronicle is quite amusing with some jaw dropping moments and does well in keeping the viewers attention.In comparison to previous found-footage movies, Chronicle beats them all, as it was both exciting and enjoyable with some scenes bound to leave you wide eyed. As for the acting, from a cast I wasn't aware of, they all put in quality performances making something so far fetched seem very realistic.Did you enjoy my review? check out my previous and up to date reviews at my blog - http://gerrysreviewsforthosecurious.blogspot.com/",Chronicle
236,serina25801,Tastefully Done and Amazing!!,10,4 February 2012,"I'm normally not a big fan of the first-person films; I found Blair Witch to be boring and Cloverfield to be nauseating (it wouldn't stop moving). A few, however, have kept me from stopping to watch them. Independent films, like Grave Encounters, and box office hits like Paranomal Activity 1 & 2.This is one of those that sets the bar! The film opens with the main character, Andrew, reflected in the mirror on his door with his new video camera. Right off the bat, it's on a tripod to keep it from moving and, while the film does have it in the characters' hands, for the most part, Andrew uses his telekinesis to suspend it in the air to keep it still. It starts off a little slow, but it sets the tone for the rest of the film. Once they discover the hole and acquire the abilities, however, the movie picks up and becomes fun.To be honest, I spent half of the film with this stupid smile stuck to my face, because that is EXACTLY what someone would do if they suddenly acquired powers. They would experiment and have fun, be stupid and joke around with people. Play pranks, etc. You do feel bad for Andrew, though. By the end of the film, you wanna keep saying that they all deserved it and anyone would snap after being through what he had gone through (nothing that the previews haven't shown, by the way).The end of the movie speeds up and is done with multiple cameras: from people having their own hand-helds filming, security cameras in buildings and police cars, it gets a little hectic. A few times I was wishing that one of the cameras would just stay still long enough, but it was still brilliantly done. I won't put any spoilers.The point is that if you want to see this film, the movie WAY passes the trailers! If you've been having doubts, see it! It's AMAZING!

237,r_massey,Insane,8,21 February 2015,"There isn't much I have to say about ""Chronicle"" other than the fact that I found it fresh, intriguing, tragic and captivating.The relationship between the three main protagonists, though odd at first, feels genuine and is a testament to the performances by the actors; their interactions are typical of teenagers, making them all the more relatable. Following their journey through the 'found footage' aids in this achievement, getting a nice insight into the personal lives of these characters. This intimacy is also what sets this film apart from simply falling into the 'superhero' movie genre and even amidst the science-fiction/fantasy aspects to the movie, the whole experience can be treated as quite realistic if such events were to happen. Going off this basis, the climax is pretty insane, but in a great way; just when you think the found footage perspective is getting tiring, it once again brings this third act to a personal level and the presentation of action is unlike anything I've ever seen. There is no musical score in the background to force us to feel like we're experiencing something truly 'epic' in the third act, as one commonly finds in a sci-fi/superhero film, as it is the cast performances and suspense created by some of the alarming visuals that ultimately create this effect.I can understand why there may be some mixed feelings towards the film, especially with the choice of found footage to drive the narrative, but I feel that ""Chronicle"" tells the compelling story that it wants to tell through both tragedy and marvel. Bearing in mind that this is a low budget film, its ramifications noticeable in the CGI (though this is something you soon get used to and actually come to praise), I would definitely recommend ""Chronicle"" for anyone interested in a fresh take on the science-fiction and superhero genre.",Chronicle

I find that far too often there's no explanation for the camera to be there, let alone be rolling, it's shaking worse than a twig in a hurricane, and the acting is often sub-par.Chronicle is a different story.Right off the bat, there's a reason for the camera. People don't ignore it or treat it as normal, and it adds a certain realism to events in the film. On top of that, the way the camera-work is done throughout the film feels real without giving me motion sickness. Add the fantastic acting and you've got yourself a brilliant character piece. Don't get me wrong, the story isn't exactly groundbreaking, but it is interesting enough and a much more realistic take on how people would likely act if given superpowers. The characters and setting just feel so real that the found-footage style actually works in the film's favor.Overall, I can't recommend this movie enough. There are a few nitpicks I have about it, but for the most part, this is one of the best found-footage films I've ever seen, and it gives me hope for the genre.",Chronicle

Boy, was I misled. This movie combined two genres of film that are really starting to annoy me, the hand-held ""mockumentary"" style, and ""let's throw some stupid teenagers into a movie and have something happen"" type.The ""mockumentary"" style of shooting in this movie was interesting at first, but became annoying when you encountered parts where you could only wonder... THIS is what happens to this kid, and the first thing he wants to do is record it? And the plethora of teen movie cliché's (the jock with rich parents and everything he wants, the misunderstood nerdy guy who nobody likes, the obligatory party, the underage drinking, the sex, stupid boys playing stupid tricks on people...blah, blah, blah) made me want to leave the movie early.Not to say that I totally hate the ""mockumentary"" genre, I genuinely enjoyed Cloverfield.

240,antoniomagallon90,Its better than I expected,8,18 March 2012,"Andrew (Dane DeHaan) is just like your average loser. His alcoholic father is abusive and his mother is dying. He is unpopular at high school and the only person he can talk to is his cousin Matt (Alex Russell). He accidentally meets Steve (Michael B. Jordan) at a club. Although Steve is the most popular kid in school, he is kindly to Andrew. So the three of then sees a mysterious hole and went down in the hole and discover something strange. We don't know what it is because it is never explained, but whatever it is, it causes them to have telekinetic powers, which can manipulate objects and lift them as well. They're learning it slowly but once they get the hang of it, things get very interesting, primary for Andrew.When first seeing the trailer, there were doubts that the movie was going to be joyful. I was wrong. One thing that surprises me the most is that the plot is smart and well told, however it is not original. Most of the film is highly influence by Carrie and Akira. The good news is that at least they didn't rip-off the story. Even better, Chronicle manages to have character developments, which is not easy to do and most films don't accomplish that. The cast mates were great for their roles, primary Dane DeHaan, the main character. Sometimes you feel sorry for him because of what he goes through, but at the same time you hate him because the things he's done. It annoys me that usually found footage films (mockumentary is a better term, but most of you guys love say ""found footage"" for whatever reason) often has one camera to tell the story, which gets old too quick. In Chronicle, even though it is mostly focus on Andrew's camera, the filmmakers were wise enough to use other people cameras to tell the story. This technique has been used before, but it has never been as accomplished as this movie has. Sadly there are some issues that I have come across with. For a high budget film, the special effects were weak. 20th Century Fox could have done a better job. Also it was too short to watch. Let me put it this way, think of a roller-coaster ride that was short and you wanted more. That's how I felt when it was over.Chronicle is fun to watch. Despite the fact that it had weak special effects and short length, the film is forgivable because of the overall experience. Chronicle is one hell of a movie. Let us hope that the studio doesn't do a sequel or else it will be a bad idea.B+",Chronicle
241,jessicareid,Really different and includes a bit of everything,8,8 August 2013,This was a film about three teenagers who develop incredible and fascinating powers after a strange encounter at a party. Throughout the film they learn to use and control their powers and discover new things they can do. This was a really enjoyable aspect of the film and the way characters reacted was fun to watch and felt believable. The way Chronicle was filmed as though it was all through the main character's video cameras made it more personal and in a way more realistic as well. The three main characters were all very different and interesting in their own way and as the film goes on you see how they all deal with their new found powers differently.What I found great about this film was how it had two very different sides. The first part was really light-hearted and comical as they try out their powers and become good friends because of their shared secrets. Then the film changed quite drastically and became quite dark as things start to go wrong and there was also a lot of great action in the latter part of them film.I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed this film and I think it is definitely worth a watch.,Chronicle
242,Darkfrog24,I just watched Darth Vader's origin story. It's called Chronicle.,8,11 February 2012,"I was not expecting that movie to be that good as art. It helps that Dane DeHaan looks like a young Mark Hamill with Alex Russel as his guy-in-the-rough Han Solo. We see an on-screen transformation of both characters, Andrew into a supervillain and Matt into a human being.This was how three teenagers would act if they suddenly had superpowers. It's full of joking and wonderfully knuckleheaded guy stuff. Visually, the flight effects can be awkward, but that did help contribute to the sense of acrophobia during the cloud scenes that we don't experience in most superhero movies. With Superman, we feel safe. With Andrew, Steve and Matt, we're waiting for the inevitable shoe to drop.This movie is daring. It leaves out information and expository scenes that most filmmakers would assume was required. As we see at the end: It's not about the answers; it's that the characters have grown to the point where they're finally asking the right questions.This isn't only a wonderful deconstruction of superpowers; it's also a commentary on the psychology of friendship and group dynamics. What the character Steve keeps trying to say is that Andrew just needed to find one thing that he was good at, and it DID NOT MATTER what it was. When Andrew stops thinking that he's a loser, so does everyone else--as we see in the wonderful scene when Andrew's mother asks him to say, ""I'm stronger than all of this,"" on camera. We see that it's the first time he believes it.",Chronicle

One camera. Zero Music and Mold-breaking visuals.In fact when I say Mold-breaking the visual effects in Chronicles go beyond the very word. ""Splitting the very fabric of the universe"" is what it should be used to describe the divine powers of this film and I don't mean the Telekenetic ones our 3 characters gain in the story, I mean that kind of CG (That's come a long way since Cloverfeild) that used to make said abilities come to life and seem so real to the point they make the Force in Star Wars look old-hat and dysfunctional (Not that the force is).The film is Essentially a visualisation of the whole ""With great power comes great responsibility"" thing used my Spider-man in marvel in that it shows the three focuses of the picture initially messing around with their abilities in broad daylight before an accident convinces them to try take better care of them. It also shows the corruption of said powers depending on the users's Exsitance. Secpifically the film explores the creation of a supervillan in how they are eventually driven to use their powers for Greedy or down-right mental purposes based on how difficult their life was before which involve a lot of pain, wrecking stuff and causing general anarchy. If you watch the whole film you'll know which of the two out of the three characters sides with the either the Light and Dark side Respectively.Although they don't technically have superhero/Supervillan names in the film cause they don't need to. I would have personally called the hero ""Tellikit"" and the Villain ""Apexus"". You'll know why I gave those characters those names if you watch the film. I wouldn't call it a masterpiece but never-the-less Chronicles offers a new, Exiting and Interesting take on a film in a strange yet popular genre that offers up hints of a sequel.",Chronicle
246,coastin_on_a_dream,Surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie,8,26 January 2014,"I am usually not a fan of these ""found footage"" movies. Some are good, but most seem to be cheap gimmicks. They aren't expensive to make, but they make a lot of money, so studios churn these out hoping to make a quick buck, and they put in very little effort, so the end result is a bad movie.Chronicle is different though. The found footage concept is obviously nothing new, but the movie has a great screenwriter and actually has a good cast of main actors. The dialogue is believable, the characters are likable, and the actors have great chemistry with each other. You actually care about the journey they go on. The story is basically a superhero villain's origin story. His name is Andrew. He's very troubled; he's bullied, his mother is chronically ill, his father is an abusive alcoholic, and he's lonely. It's easy to see how he goes off the rails later in the movie and abuses his new found superpowers. He's so tragically misguided and sad, and as an audience, we feel sympathy for him.Although we see everything from Andrew's POV, the audience also identifies with Matt, his cousin and the closest person he has to a best friend. Matt is the most normal one, and as Andrew begins to lose his grip on reality, we identify with Matt because he sees things objectively and wants to take a step back and figure out what is going on.What really helps the movie is that the main characters are so well developed and likable. I went into this movie expecting a movie about stupid teenagers destroying things were their telekinetic powers, but it gave the audience much more than that.Overall, this movie was well worth the money. I do wish they had fleshed out a few things, story-wise, but I think the idea was to leave it open for a sequel. They created a nice story and there's much to be explored. I would highly recommend this movie because the entertainment value is so high.I give this a solid 8/10.",Chronicle
247,foxx_1,Losing faith in Hollywood,1,29 April 2012,"Let me tell you, I hated ""Jumper"" for its total incoherence and lack of moral substance - and ended up watching this movie which might as well be titled ""Jumper 2""... It is simply insane that more and more directors/scriptwriters are jumping on the bandwagon, making more of those ""handheld style"" movies. How is something that is amateur and simply annoying e.g. playing with the zoom, swinging the camera around etc. supposed to be entertaining? Unfortunately, this is just one of the problems with this movie. The first 30 minutes we get to watch one of the characters filming around and explaining to everyone why is he doing so. That could have been cut down to 5 minutes and still served the same purpose i.e. who is who and why are they acting like that... but if the scriptwriters did so they would have to think of something to fill in the remaining 60 minutes. So after the boring beginning, out of nowhere, they learn about some noise coming from a cave nearby and just walk in. What was that object inside and how come nobody ever noticed it before? Too hard to explain so we are left wondering. Looking at the mysterious object turns out to be quite beneficial: for some reason the 3 characters gain cool superpowers that they manage to develop further simply by training so they can not only move Lego pieces around but even manage to learn how to fly (?!?) How telekinesis can be fashioned into flying is yet another mystery. Strangely, the one who is beaten up by an abusive father and cares a lot about his sick mother (Andrew) turns into an evil monster who never questions his actions - just because he considers himself a predator. From my point of view, this totally absurd development did not make any sense and is a complete script failure. The film obviously needed some action so I guess the scriptwriters figured ""Hey how about a cool battle between Andrew and Matt?"" Then all of a sudden Andrew is full of criminal energy and needs a few hundred bucks - so how about robbing some bullies and a gas station. No clue why he did not try robbing a bank with his superpowers and just toss around the bullies as pure act of revenge - let's assume he is not only turning evil but also a complete moron. Somehow the writers expect the audience to be morons too: instead of flying away after his heist, he prefers to run (?!?) Nice. Anyway, we get to a showdown with lots of explosions for their own sake - again, the evil kid might have just conveniently chosen to fly away instead of blowing up downtown Seattle but hey, he is evil, remember? So he has to get what he deserves and the audience gets the mandatory dose of good vs. bad fight.Basically, another letdown - if you take out the special effects, the remaining story would be totally useless. I expected the car accident that occurred earlier in the film and played such a pivotal role to lead to some interesting developments - but to my great surprise, it simply did not. Dead end, zero. Instead we got to see some extended flights through the clouds which served no specific purpose other than adding some screen time - which unfortunately only confirms my conclusion: story with a lot of potential but lacking imagination and depth.",Chronicle
248,zgamer-1,"Superheroes via ""The Blair Witch Project""",9,5 February 2012,"Three teenagers stumble across a meteorite that gives them telekinetic powers and each react differently to their growing abilities. This is a very simple premise and the films eighty three minute run time is a testament to that. What will surprise you, however, is how much each minute counts to making ""Chronicle"" a distinct entry in the found footage genre and the superhero genre.The writing and direction are top notch in this, especially for the newcomers behind them. We are always focused on the main characters and what they are going through. There is no dizzying camera-work or choppy editing to try and disorientate us. This actually feels like a naturally shot faux-documentary. There is a lot of great dialogue in the film, particularly because it actually feels written for teenage characters. It has those semi-juvenile lines mixed in with attempts at more mature comments that feels like teens preparing to leave high school. The pace and tone are well controlled too, combining elements of an action film, a ""Blair Witch"" style documentary, a teen comedy, a dysfunctional family drama and a ""high school massacre"" style tragedy (particularly through the starting scenes of the third act). Best of all, it never breaks the found footage illusion. We are always immersed firsthand into the scenario and aside from some seemingly inconsistent moments, there is almost always a plausible way to maintain the documentary style.The actors really needed to be top notch to make this believable and thankfully they chose some very talented unknowns. There is Michael B. Jordan as Steve, who really feels like a popular kid who gained his fame from being a great guy rather than an attention seeker. There is Alex Russell as Matt, who blends the right amount of ""too cool for school"" swagger with genuine good guy qualities. Then there is Dane DeHaan as Andrew, who seems all too comfortable playing the reclusive and increasingly disturbed character. He is really the lead character and while his arc may seem strange at first, it feels like the only way he could have gone with his quirks and defects. Each of these actors work great on their own, but it is their great chemistry that drives the film. They really feel like guys who became great friends through a unique circumstance and it makes the eventual drama all the more hard hitting.The effects lend to some truly incredible scenes. Thanks to the aforementioned camera-work and editing mixed with some great visuals, we get moments that work great because it is done found footage style. On one end of the spectrum, we get terrific scenes of awe like the guys playing football thirty thousand feet in the air. On the other, we get some great comedy bits as they use their powers to cause mischief in a toy store. Somewhere in between, we get some great action scenes like the finale caught on multiple types of cameras one shot after the other. It is unfortunate that this brings up one of my biggest gripes with the film. As great and subtle as a lot of the effects were, there were several scenes where highlighted moments of effects looked badly rendered. Among them are a scene with Lego blocks and some of the character models during action scenes. While the film is working with a smaller budget, the fact most of the effects looked so good makes those moments stand out.I had so much fun with this movie. It had more going on in eighty three minutes than many movies do that run over two hours. A great film to lead the way for 2012 possibly being a great year in cinema.",Chronicle

Some quibbles: Anyone who has seen Akira knows that this is more than an homage, it is a ripoff. Why have a lead character that looks exactly like Leonardo DeCaprio?""High schoolers"" that look as old as college grads. The extras at the welcome party looked like the right age.How can they gain these powers and not at least make a joke about being a Jedi?Good guy pushes the rules. They didn't see Spider-Man either? They could have mentioned the part about great power and responsibility.Why make it a found-footage film? To create it, sources had to be pulled not only from the lead's cam, but a hastily inserted and extraneous female video vlogger, and news and security footage. It should have just been presented as a straightforward documentary.Still, an OK way to pass 90 minutes. Not a buy, though.",Chronicle
250,jennifer626,Sleeper movie that should have received much more attention,8,17 November 2012,"I stumbled across this title when I was looking through the On Demand library for a movie I haven't seen yet. I was encouraged by the positive reviews on IMDb, and they turned out to be right on target.Chronicle compellingly explores how ""real"" teenagers might react to unexpectedly receiving extraordinary powers. Although I recognized none of the three young leads (or any of the supporting cast, for that matter), each actor brought depth and humanity to his role and we should see more of Dane DeHaan (Andrew) and Alex Russell (Matt)in the near future. The teens acquire their new skills early in the film, and the first hour is spent establishing their characters and relationships. Each one deals with the abilities differently, and the movie grows increasingly dark and suspenseful as they unsuccessfully attempt to set moral guidelines for their conduct. I was literally on the edge of my seat during the last 20 minutes as the fragile framework snapped.Definitely recommend, you will not be disappointed.",Chronicle

It was released in '12 and here I just finished watching it with my son in '16. Normally if a movie eludes me like that, it's most likely because it's really not worth watching...not the case here!All of the key elements of a film are executed very well - good story, well written script, great cast who all delivered solid roles. The effects for their powers was done in a very realistic believable way.I'm not sure if this is based on a book or anything, but expect to see at least a sequel, and it has the potential to become a solid trilogy. So if you're like me, and you missed this one when it came out, give it a watch. You won't be disappointed.",Chronicle
253,D-Gal,"Tried really hard to love it, but felt it was lacking in many areas",5,14 May 2016,"I confess that I am a pretty big fan of found footage films, and if the screenplay is really good, the movie can be absolutely epic! I really wanted to love this movie because it had so much potential, but it didn't quite get there for me. The idea of a large underground, glowing, foreign object that has the ability to give people telekinesis while being within a certain vicinity of it is an interesting and intriguing concept, but the story-line was very 2 dimensional. It was heavily based on the lives and actions of 3 protagonist teenagers whom possessed telekinetic abilities after contact, and the film never veered back to this object underground. We learned absolutely nothing about this object whatsoever. We don't know if anybody else discovered this object or if it ended up in government possession; we just don't know. Toward the end of the movie it felt like just another revenge/betrayal film as one of the teenagers turned on everybody and ended up feeling all too cliché for my liking. The special effects weren't horrendous, but they weren't amazing. In saying that though, you can't expect pure greatness with only a 12 million dollar budget. I do praise the film for its ability to accumulate 126.6 million USD in the box office off of only 10 million USD. I think a reboot of this movie with an altered story-line and a higher budget could be phenomenal. Bring in depth and sense of intrigue with better characters, an extremely enjoyable cast and limited cliché moments and you have yourself a stupendous film. I personally feel that IMDb's rating of 7.1/10 is a little overrated for what, I feel, the film is as a whole, but I have a bad habit of looking too far into a movie; I always wait for and want the moments that truly blow me away so I'm okay with being picky. All in all, it is an OKAY movie that you should watch once just for the sake of it. Everybody's preference in movies varies, but it's good to hire for a one time watch (to me).Mediocre. Not for me. 5/10",Chronicle
254,lisa-629,"Very entertaining, but nothing to write home about",6,6 February 2012,"Although entertaining, Chronicle has quite a lacking dialogue, attempting to capture the high school lingo fell flat for me from the beginning. But the story itself has amazing potential, three high school boys jump into a hole in the ground and encounter a magical rock/meteor/radioactive stone, not completely sure what the hell it is, and magically attain super human powers. In the beginning, the boys attempt to push the limits of their new found abilities, flying, moving objects, just having fun with it. Then one of the boys starts to combine his newfound abilities with his personal, violent and depressing home life. He starts using his powers to hurt others by fighting, stealing, robbing, and pretty much anything he wants. This is where the story took a turn towards a direction that could've been brilliant, but just made the boy appear silly and downright selfish. Perhaps he went mad, perhaps all the years of bullying finally caught up with him, but killing a bunch of people didn't seem to be the way he should've gone, it just felt so forced to me, and I'm sure to many others. I still recommend the film, it is an entertaining story with plenty of action.",Chronicle
255,ulricjoh,I wish I could give a negative vote - there's no way this is a 7.5...,1,5 February 2012,"From the outset, I will say that I liked the Blair Witch Project - it was unique in it's use of a hand-held camera to film most of the work. I thought that Cloverfield was good, although it was a bit of a rehash in the style of Blair Witch Project. This movie just seemed to have no idea on how to get the best of the hand-held camera.It was too repetitive, the camera work too shaky, the story implausible (dare I say utter cr@p), the script was dry and I felt that I wasted my time watching this nonsense.I can only think that the people who rated this movie so highly were either friends of the movie company or have no idea what makes a good movie.Here are a few of the inconsistencies: 1) The kids find the ""rock"" which gives them special powers. After the area is closed off by the authorities, it is no longer given any reference in the movie.2) They fly up into the sky, at the same level that jets are flying, yet they have no problem with hypothermia or lack of oxygen at high altitudes.3) There are references to nose-bleeds when they use their powers but the bleeds are irregular and don't have any impact on their lives other than the boys commenting ""I've got a bad nose bleed"". Why even mention them ? All in all, this is a movie that is seriously well worth avoiding at all costs.",Chronicle

The overall film looked promising but i thought the plot would let it down a bit. Oh how i was wrong....What i actually saw was a very clever, well put together production. The special effects weren't over exaggerated as i sometimes find in these sorts of films and i think the overall effects done the plot well. I also liked the fact that there were really only 3 characters in the film, of course there were others but the 3 boys were on their own for around 75% of the movie, which i find doesn't confuse the plot too much. The plot was actually one of the strongest aspects of this movie, it was simple yet clever, and there were no empty points as far as i could see.The only and very small criticism i would have about this movie is that it was quite short, maybe a low budget movie like this would be expected to be no longer than 90 minutes long, but this was still quite short as far as low budget movies go.Other than this i thought the film was excellent and fully deserves a 9/10. Well Done Indeed.",Chronicle

258,SuperMah,With great power comes great responsibility,8,26 April 2012,"This is not your average superhero movie as you may think because of the characters inheriting superpowers. It is more of a story of innocence, friendship and evil taking over. The movie kicks off with showing us the life of each of the characters prior to their inheritance of the superpowers. The struggles and the bond of friendship is shown throughout the movie. An insight is given on how the characters gain these superpowers but no explanation on how and why so we are left with a mystery but not an unpleasant one that will make you feel this movie is stupid or intolerable. The bond of friendship grows as the characters start to learn more about what they have become and stretch the limits. However, as time goes on controlling this power becomes a struggle and the friends face challenges that they need to overcome.The acting in this movie was absolutely brilliant. You can feel the struggles of each character although they are all experiencing it in a different way. The story line is magnificent. Unique which makes it exciting for viewers.

The part of the film where the boys discover their super powers is sort of believable and the kind of stunts they pull - teenage. The story arc of the main character is a little more predictable - think the ""little corporal"" or Col Gadaffi; but you wonder why films like this cannot show people rising above their circumstances rather than being consumed by them - know your place! I think a person who expects power and respect from others is more likely to get megalomania when he gets more of it and not understand limits, than one for whom it is a new experience - think bankers bonuses! That said, the way the film was pulled together was excellent and the grey rainy feel added to the dark brooding nature of the story.

Let's hope they never go to Hollywood with this.",8,7 February 2012,"I can't stand the ""found footage"" type of stuff and I easily have motion sickness. The found footage aspect of the movie is just a pretext for the story to unfold - I found it neither disturbing or annoying.Enough with the cautious beating around the bush stance with this movie. Now when I think back about SpiderMan, Xmen, Hulk (to a lesser degree), the Fantastic 4, Thor, IronMan, Green Lantern and especially Batman - they feel so ""cheesy"" compared to this. I can only laugh (especially at Batman's voice). Only the original two Superman remain true to what we are - humans. Who cares about their glossy moralistic little tales of spoiled brats or boyish science geeks in weird cities that bear no connection to real life, wearing kevlar reinforced spandex and such speaking with big voices to make us thing they're cool. The paper comics were so much better - Hollywood ruined it all just to make a buck out of it.Chronicle was just a blast, it felt real, like it happened to some friends or your kids, it was funny, well acted, well written, the effect were very good - and we don't get to see a close-up of a spaceship fuselage for 5 minutes (luckily, that sort of garbage is so overrated and we're done with Star Wars once and for all... no wait, now you'll get the metal fuselage in 3D for 5 mins - *please applaud*). The movie was compact and no time is wasted on our characters' past lives in Tibet or their kindergarten girlfriends, Jar-Jar and such other pets like MaryJane or other butler/waitress. We get to know them as they deal with what happens. It's not that it's so original, you can see where this is going, but the last part of the movie becomes very climatic, and the effects are well put to use. For me it was a greater ride than the marvel/dc stuff. Let's hope Hollywood doesn't get a hold of this in order to make 2-3 cash-milking sequels.Enter Chronicle.",Chronicle
261,achsaphillippi8,"An intense movie, definitely worth seeing",10,7 February 2012,"Finally a different kind of superhero movie! This movie does not involve super villains, spandex outfits, or a love story. This is the story of three normal high school kids who gain extraordinary powers, and begin using them for their own pleasure. This is a story of how great power can lead to great corruption. It also shows you what bullying, isolation, and ridicule could do to a person.The movie starts out fairly well; it sets up the everyday life of the main character who holds the camera for most of the movie. He comes from a broken home, and is harassed and bullied in school. You go through the whole movie feeling sorry for him, no matter what happens. The main character, his cousin, and their friend discover something that grants them amazing telepathic abilities, and the movie really begins to open up.The great thing about the middle portion of the movie is its light-hearted tone. As the three guys fool around with their new abilities, you smile, laugh, and gasp in awe along with them. And then the tone darkens. It's amazing to see the character developments later on, and it's easy to feel sympathy and pain for the characters. As certain things start to go bad, it's not hard to feel a sense of desperation and intensity as the events unfold.Along with the characters and the story, the camera work and special effects really add another dimension to the movie. It's easy to see what is going on, as the shaky-camera technique is not abused in this movie. The dark tunnels, the cloudy skies, and the emotional interactions between the characters were very well done. In the scene high in the clouds, you can actually feel a sense of weightlessness. The action scenes are very intense, and will keep you on the edge of your seat.I won't give anything from the end away, but I will say that it was a very good wrap-up for all the events that had occurred before. It seemed like the best way to bring the conflicts to an end.I definitely recommend this movie for all who want to see something fairly new among movies about superheroes. There are no super villains, no costumes, and no love story, rather it's a story about being at war with yourself, friendship, and strength. It also teaches you a lesson: don't ever ridicule someone for being different, especially if you have no idea what kind of background they come from.

I do like found footage films, and I've been a fan of the genre since the blair which, but this film took the genre to a whole different level. This isn't no cheap effects film where the camera is always shaking because there's nothing to show, this film had fantastic effects. And did very well for its budget. The acting was great, I was convinced the whole time as a viewer that these teenagers had those abilities, as anyone if they got those abilities would be having fun and doing stupid pranks. But as they get stronger the whole film changed into a 'matrixy super man' type of film. Without spoiling too much, it has its fair share of flying around and great action sequences. I must say this one of the most original films I've every seen and better yet the best found footage film ever made. This film was short but takes you on a great adventure all the way through and even emotional at times. So for this my overall rating is, 5 starts (10/10) And also the best found footage film ever made, alongside Blair which, Clover field, End of watch.",Chronicle
265,sarah-lou_12,"""My favourite kind of hero""",10,30 March 2015,"Chronicle tells the story of a young boy named Andrew - an outcast, abused by his father and, more often than not, his peers too. Andrew's an extremist version of Spiderman - he just doesn't fit in. And then, suddenly, he comes into this amazing power. Unlike Spidey, Andrew's friends also inherit this power. What follows is the story of their discovery of their own boundaries. Many boundaries are discovered and crossed in this film - not all of them positive. One thing can be sure - this is not a superhero movie. It's more an accurate representation of what would happen if teenagers got super powers - they'd prank people in supermarkets and play extreme football. The first half of this film, though clouded with dark undertones, is mostly light hearted. Unfortunately, due to his tragic past, you can only assume that Andrew's mind is going to take this power way too far. I won't say anything else, but I will say that the ending will not leave you disappointed. If you love morally questionable, tragic protagonists, you'll love Andrew. I personally loved Chronicle. I didn't think the found footage element in any way detracted from the storyline. I'm not actually entirely sure 'found footage' is exactly the right word. I don't think anybody is claiming to have found these tapes and put them together, I think this was just a useful and alternative medium with which to tell the story. Either way, the film was great, the storyline was interesting and there were a lot of issues explored. To conclude, if you love anti-heroes, you liked Dane Dehaan as The Green Goblin, and you're in the mood for some seriously emotional content, as well as some laughs and some stupendous action sequences (Considering the low budget), you should probably go watch Chronicle.

He likes to shoot things on his camera, yet is bullied for almost everything he does, including this. Without giving away too much, he quickly makes some friends after receiving telekinesis at a barn party. Because Andrew records everything, we feel like we are a part of him, like his imaginary friend and we begin to feel for him as he makes new friends. After a while, he begins showing his darker side, after trying to rescue is mother, dying with Caner, and being abused by his alcoholic father. His friends attempt to stop him from becoming depressed and resentful again, but he fights back, accidentally killing one of his friends in the process. The other, his cousin, knows exactly what he has done, and why he's filming everything, makes it the even more scary. But when he stops filming, the footage from car dash cams and helicopter cameras makes us feel as if we are no longer Andrew's friend, and we cannot help to feel sorry for him as he fights his only friend to the death.Overall, Chronicle is a very good film and for a low budget is phenomenal.",Chronicle

Extremely relatable kid and if you're gone thru the same thing, the very raw scenes with his abusive father will hit close to home. The CGI is fantastic for a $15M production. A very interesting twist on the superhero genre that is fun for the first half and then becomes very dark with a third act that is so absolutely bonkers, it would Katsuhiro Otomo (Akira) proud.

I knew the basic plot and thought that with the combination of special effects, the storyline, and the gimmick of the found-footage film, that this film would be original. In other words, I had high hopes and may have expected a bit too much from this movie. The plot is simple : a few kids stumble upon a creepy hole in the ground that gives them the power of telekinesis. Also know as the ability to move things using the mind. One of the kids begins to use the power in destructive/evil ways, and the film takes off from there. The problem is getting to this point. The beginning is very slow and the exposition is a bit boring. The film doesn't really get going until they discover their superpowers. Even at points between then and the climax, the film stalls.The special effects featured in the film are realistic and beautifully done, but again, nothing game-changing or special here. All in all, this movie was weird, visually stunning,and genuinely acted, but at points boring and sometimes cracked under the weight of the found- footage gimmick.

270,akik1259,"If real teens got superpowers, this is probably what they would do!",8,23 January 2014,"This movie pleasantly surprised me. All you need to know about the story is that three teens mysteriously gain superpowers and have fun just screwing around with them in idiotic ways. However, when one of them takes a dark turn, the movie becomes more plot driven.The movie is found footage format, so it uses a single camera to film things. Overall, the special effects are good yet practical. They are not over the top, like in many action movies. There are some truly hilarious scenes of the guys using their powers in regular, everyday places. Who wouldn't want to abuse their powers on unsuspecting people? The characters (there are only three, maybe four) are pretty well developed. They bond with each other over their new powers. However, when you learn how crappy life is for one of them, Andrew, you can probably guess what will ultimately happen to his character (teen angst, physical abuse, superpowers, you do the math.) The movie takes a dark turn and all hell pretty much breaks loose in the climax. Here's where the sense of scale gets upped and the effects go crazy. It pretty much becomes a full blown action movie. You can tell most of the budget was spent on the climax.A few minor complaints. Because the movie is found footage, no doubt you are going to get some slow moments. Some parts feel a little too drawn out, such as when we're forced to listen to one of the guys cry, but thankfully these moments are few. Also, Andrews character was a bit too whiny and annoying, and his dad was a bit over the top in his physical and verbal abuse. Also, I thought it wrapped up a little to quickly; they probably cold have done more with the climax.As far as found footage movies with unknown actors go, this is definitely one of the best. It's a unique take on the superhero genre, and when it's got a budget and compelling story to back it up, it makes for an enjoyable movie.",Chronicle
271,jens-wegar,Your basic vengeance superhero movie,6,24 May 2012,"It was better than I expected, I'll give it that. Not since The Blair Witch project have I seen the hand held camera concept been used so well. Often you did have the feeling that the camera was just following along in the hands of one of the guys, which was the point of course. They also had a very good way of introducing a second angle every now and then by having another teen run around with a camera the whole time filming for her blog or showing footage from security cams or news crews. Realistically, in those situations the sound scape changed as well. For instance when showing security camera footage there would be no sound. The film stayed true to it's format by always providing a sound scape as it would have been picked up by the camera currently showing it's image on screen, which definitely added to the ""realism"" of it all.In the end though this is your basic high-school-nerd-taking-out-revenge-on-all-that-do- him-wrong movie. Even though I must say to some extent it's provides you with a warm fuzzy feeling to see the bullies get what they deserve, the next turn of events is not very hard to predict at any point. You have the basic stages of super heroism, such as getting to grips with your powers, realizing you can do good/evil, and either straying to the dark side or seeing the light.",Chronicle
272,Samandreas66,Unbreakable 2,10,19 February 2012,"I really enjoyed chronicle from start to finish.This movie pushed the envelope on the found footage genre and the superhero genre as well.The way the filmmakers used the whole found footage idea was pretty smart.The storyline actually works and kept me engaged.Chronicle feels like an origin story of one of the main characters.The special effects look good considering how much this movie cost to develop.Also this movie is realistic and has some good characters.The acting felt realistic and I actually cared for the characters.The three central characters Steve,Matt and Andrew represent some cliché characters from high school but have more to them.My favorite character had to be Steve because for me he actually develops more depth.A lot of people complained about the running time but I had no problem with the eighty three minute running time.The running time didn't bother me at all I felt like I got my money's worth half way through the movie.The whole big spectacular climatic fight scene was amazing.This movie feels like a fan boy film but it works.Chronicle mixes unbreakable meets cloverfield meets akira meets superman II meets breakfast club.What more can someone ask for.Max Landis and josh trank has revived the found footage genre to the stratosphere and made the whole idea of superheroes better.",Chronicle
273,tagerjd,Appropretly done for the budget.,7,27 July 2016,"Chronicle tells the story of three friends who upon attending a party fall upon a mysterious rock that grants them superpowers. Although it was outstanding for a superhero movie and certainly took risks that the M.C.U. as well as Fox's X-Men universes would dare to try, as a stand alone film its predictable as can be. But it was good.Chronicle was good because of its fleshed out characters that all felt relatable. And to add on to the fact that the main trio in the film are teenagers it feels all the more relatable through how they react to the events in the film. And although the promotional material might show this movies plot being simply about superpowers it surprisingly has an emotionally gripping though predictable main plot about the main character that makes this movie all the more riveting.The main complaints I have with this movie is how the effects did not look convincing. This problem is pretty visibly due to the films budget. Thankfully since the movie was done on a smaller scale this problem did not take me out of the movie. There were also some character decision's that did not make the most since, but this movie was enjoyable as well as unique.In conclusion Chronicle was good, I thought. I'm glad that it tried something new, and I'm even happier that the movie was able to grip me in way I did not think a superhero movie could. This is without a doubt one of my favorite films of 2012, and will probably be making my list. And I'm giving this one a 7/10.",Chronicle
274,doomas10,I believe i can fly,9,1 February 2012,"I had mixed feelings about this. The trailer does not do justice to this film at all. The characters seem to be the ultimate bullies, interested only in women and stupid child-like pranks. Fortunately this is not the case. ""Chronicle"" reveals the story of three teenagers who discover a meteor-like thing that gives them incredible abilities such as flying, superhuman strength and telekinesis. Things go wrong when they overabuse their power. Or don't they? See, this is how ""Chronicle"" wants you to believe but the film takes an interesting turn. Mostly based around Andrew, a passive and shy individual who happens to record everything, with almost no friends with almost no friends expect his intellectual and popular cousin Matt. A frequent problem with the found footage genre is the fact that characters continue to film the occurring events even if the s**t is hitting the fan and people are sliced, diced, eaten alive, possessed, require help etc. Here though a nice trick is that Andrew has such a powerful mind that could do all the amazing things do while lifting the camera to record his achievements. Now that we got that out of the way, i can safely say that ""Chronicle"" contains some of the best scenes shot in this style. Make no mistake. You won't be dizzy after this. It's like being shot by a pro. Sometimes it never feels like the film belongs in that genre but let's say that it could be a sci-fi-ish teenage drama from a first person perspective. Sometimes the camera holder is not even Andrew and you get to witness the actions from various other perspectives. This is a slick touch. Now, you think you know the story but you don't. I was positively surprised about the way it unfolds in the big screen and the circumstances that surround it. First of all, all three leads are exceptional actors, especially the vulnerable and angry Andrew and the well-spirited Matt. The characters are sharply presented and while the posters of the film want you to think that about them, really they are just teenagers who desire fun and freedom. Additionally, Josh Trank is wise enough to show to the audience some real friendship scenes with actually funny pranks and quality time spending that bonds the trio together. Particularly, Andrew's school and house environment help portray his psychology better than the other two as we spend most of the sceen time learning his perspective. Towards the (destructive and emotional) climax, in which you already know who is bad and good, yet you kinda root for all of them and that is quite an accomplishment.The standout scene that gave me chills in a good way was the discovery of the fly ability. You will believe a man can fly. The realistic approach on that sequence is breathtaking and it really elevates you to the clouds, thousand meters from the ground along with the characters. It's been a while since i felt such a strong emotion. How much i would love to be able to do such a thing. Visit places all around the world just like that, with a movement of my body. At this moment, we start investing to the story and its main human components. Their ideas are not to impress the crowds and win the prom queens with their skills. It is travelling, simple as that. Nevetheless, the only minor complaint i could have about ""Chronicle"" is the sudden and total turn of Andrew. Despite having loads of problems with his classmates, his father and mother, it feels a bit forced to go against society as well (not though unexplainable).Still, ""Chronicle"" is easily one of the best films i have seen in years. With its short duration, it contains both originality and innovation with an emotional content and packed with likable characters and a storyline in which the audience could understand and relate to. Josh Trank seems to be a promising director and i am curious to see his next directional effort. Until then, i will dream that i can fly.",Chronicle

I recall seeing it before, but I do not understand why any movie would feature it. Maybe for a few minutes. Hand-held cameras have been around for decades, so it is not new technology. Maybe it is fun to watch if the viewer is doing lots of drugs. The ability for practically anyone to film stuff is somewhat new, but I do not understand why that would make it a good tool for a movie. And then there are periodic short skips in the movie. Perhaps it is expressive in some way, like how to be annoying as possible while making a movie. Too weird IMO.",Chronicle

I first I thought it was going to be stupid and silly but I totally relate to Andrew and I totally enjoyed the movie.Andrew learned the hard way from practical life experience from his drunken useless father and the jerk bullies at school how useless pathetic people are and how much better animals are than people.Unfortunately his goody goody two shoes cousin was so worried about the jerks Andrew was hurting, he ended up killing Andrew in the end. The ironic part is how he claimed that ""for Andrew his cousin"" he was going to figure out how they got these magical powers and ""to do good for humanity"". Andrew could care less about humanity because he knew how inhumane people are! And Andrew could care less about the source of their magical power either. So how ironic!",Chronicle

We both enjoyed the movie and thought it was intense but with an interesting message.My 12-yr old daughter didn't make it past the first 7 minutes so any preteens who feel the emotions very deeply may not be able to handle what happens in the movie or the relationship between Andrew and his father, mother, or some of the school bullies later on.The movie goes into some deep emotions and you ride the roller-coaster with the main character Andrew: you feel sorry for him, hate the mean people surrounding him, rejoice when he has friends, laugh at the 'learn the powers' antics, and are bewildered and upset when he abuses his new-found powers.We were truly surprised at the ending and my son wanted any future teen viewers to know that it is a good movie with a good message but it is sad. As a parent, I'd want someone to know the same things.I'd recommend for 13 yrs + unless said teen is like my daughter and not able to handle the bullying and parental situations.",Chronicle

280,smijatov89,Misguided with a good idea,5,20 July 2013,"This is a tough call. While the premise is interesting, and the story quite entertaining, something's just missing with ""Chronicle."" It plays around with the whole superhero/villain theme, which is rather refreshing. It seems that in most sci-fi stories that involve sudden gains of power, the protagonist is always somehow good. ""Chronicle"" plays rather well with this notion, which is a new spin to the story -- it's the Magneto of regular superhero films. Otherwise, the biggest setback of the film is it's rather poor character development. While we are made to feel sorry for the main protagonist, Andrew, the ways that we are made to feel that way are rather clichéd: no friends, bullied at school, abusive father, etc. His rage and his inner turmoil somehow is multiplied to the verge of bursting, without it quite making a lot of sense. The three main actors were pretty decent, especially Alex Russell who was the most engaging and believable of characters. The hand-held camera, and the very choice to do a camera perspective for the entire film, is a rather divisive choice as I have come to see in reviews, but I did not mind it all that much. The escalation of the story by the end somehow happened out of nowhere and escalated quite dramatically. A bit too much for my taste, with a rather anticlimactic ending. It was a nicely conceived idea and some great visuals can be seen in the film, but this falls into the mediocre bracket easily. 5/10",Chronicle
281,JBlueNote,Superhero Meets Cloverfield,7,3 February 2012,"Man oh man what a movie. It wasn't as intense as the movie I saw last week (""The Grey""), but it sure was something. If your a fan of Cloverfield, Quarantine, or the Paranormal Activity movies, this one is for you. It was mostly shot in that first person view style like those movies were, and what was cool about that was it was shown through more than one person's camera besides the main character's. If there was someone close by who was recording something, the scene would change to their point of view at one point. The plot of the movie was mostly centered around this one guy who, if you've seen the trailers, gains some hidden power along with two other guys. The rest of the movie is basically what happens next. It kind of gave me an idea of how a person in any situation would react to gaining such a gift. Sadly unlike ""The Grey"", there weren't any extra features after all the credits. If I were to rate this movie, I'd give it a ""mind-blowing"" (haha) 7/10 stars.",Chronicle

The opening is that of a typical American teen movie and will definitely appeal to audiences in this age group. Before you know it you're lost in the crazy action of cameras and boys exploring their childhood fantasy of flying. I enjoyed the modest amount of action this movie provided,especially Andrew a depressed and unpredictable character.In fact,Chronicle could have out performed most big budget films if the camera was used more smartly to capture some of the shots that we didn't get to see.Watch it yourself to see what I mean.

Then Matt and his friend Steve stumble on a strange hole. They talk Andrew into filming as they explore the hole, cave and what it contains. What is in the cave can't be explained, yet gives them strange powers and brings out their dark side.Most of the movie is filmed from Andrew's viewpoint—literally—as though he is filming the movie himself. As a result the story is raw and gritty. This filming style is not my taste and I found it rather boring. However, it is a pretty good illustration of the pent up anger kids can have if they face verbal and/or physical abuse at home and/or school. Especially if no one takes the time or energy to truly care.",Chronicle

Andrew, Steven, and Andrew's cousin Matt find a random pothole in the forest that is stuffed with crystals that gives them superpowers. They have fun with their newly-acquired powers.Andrew lets his powers take over his mind that he goes insane just to help his dying mother. He almost kills his father in one scene out of anger.In short, this film is worth watching just for the powers and how they use them.

Still thought it was great, something different, even if at times predictable. You know he's going to put the hurt to someone at school at some point, and going to have a little payback with dad, and because of trailer totally lose it, but still cool. Not sure about the part when his friend Steve gets zapped by the lightning as far as the explanation. That was confusing. Matt confronts Andrew and asks him to explain how Steve got zapped by lightning and there wasn't even any reports of lightning. Looked like a lot of activity going on in the scene, a real sh*t storm more or less, so why the line that there was no reports of lightning? Did Andrew create the lightning? And if so, it's there, wouldn't there be a report of its activity, especially if he created it and it wasn't expected. I'm not a whetherman, maybe at a certain altitude there's 'lightning' but then wouldn't planes get zapped out of the air? That was the only flaw for me, because I bought into the movie and the world it created, just the part about Matt's scene with Andrew didn't make sense. I mean there was lightning all around and that's how he got killed, whether Andrew re-directed it or not, it seemed lie they were surrounded by it, so why did Matt say there were no reports of lightning? Other than that rant, liked that it was something different. I didn't even care that the under ground rock phenomenon of how they get their powers wasn't totally clear. Thought the way that it affected them differently as far as mentally was great, too, because they all had different outlooks on life and even thought they all got the same dose of powers, some where able to expand on them more and want to do different things with them. Had a real, probably unintentionally, comic book hero-villain concept brewing. Like when one gets powers they use it for good, and the person (like Andrew) who has a bad seed in his head, goes evil. Now that I write this I think this could have been a great vehicle for hero and villain set up, kind of like batman and the joker but even more intense. There hasn't been a new comic book villain and hero in a long time, this could have been the perfect vehicle. Maybe it's time! I like Batman and Superman and X-Men and so on, but maybe it's time for a new generation of super heroes and super villains. All in all, thought movie was great. It was great and original.

I didn't see ONE commercial for this movie, yet saw an ad on the tomato movie website and after watching the trailer I knew this movie was gong to be AWESOME :) :)! This isn't your ordinary superhero origin story: this is REAL kids who gain phenomenal powers MINUS ANY responsibility! that alone made for the greatness of this unflinching look at 'what would YOU do if you had this power?' That pretty much sums up 'Chronicle'.The characters are believable. The script and dialogue is refreshingly realistic (doesn't sound forced for the sake of making the movie plausible). I mean, the character talk, act like, and say things that actual boneheaded teenagers would say given the circumstances (those circumstances being the ability of telekinesis). No high-reaching noble acts here; no one is saving the world and fighting super-villains. These kids are demi-gods walking the earth and they are out to have a helluva time and capture it all on camera :)The camera work is truly inspirational! The flying scenes - in their remarkably simple execution- are some of the BEST special effects I've seen in a very, very long time, considering the film's low budget. But in the final act of the movie, the multiple camera angles that capture the climatic events was definitely inspired work. Kudos to the director! Finally - watching a troubled kid go from tortured soul to nigh-unstoppable villain with an agenda was definitely disturbing to watch unfold and worth the price of admission. Early on, you want to feel bad for the kid from all the undue hardship he goes through.... that is, until he starts wrecking havoc and turning into something nearing evil. Suddenly, your sympathy turns to creeping dread, and by the third act you're hoping that some way, somehow, someone can stop this kid.If you haven't seen or even heard of Chronicle - WATCH IT RIGHT NOW! :)",Chronicle

BUt Chronicle surprised me a lot when it didn't go down the same downfall where many of similar products usually go. This is one movie that you of course want to watch on the big screen, but don't worry! you can still watch it on your small screen laptop and still enjoy how the story is developed with a careful and joyful pace! Chronicle is a simple story that so neatly narrates how easy it is that humans join the dark side of the power! Chronicle beautifully tells what it plans to say by drawing out a natural setting where man so easily becomes a slave of his own temptations and heavily impacted by his surroundings.Acting is not the best point of strength in Chronicles, but it's nothing that would in anyhow ticks you off or distract you from the story. In fact, it's not bad at all! The visual effect I should say is pretty decent considering the amount of destruction scenes we see throughout the movie and specifically during the last 15 minutes of it. Chronicle is about a film inside a film; Although the characters never go back to watch it again, but the film itself is worth watching for a second time! (though for those who're not into the hand-held narrative documentary style of shooting, the movie may become annoying at some point). I give 4 stars out 5 as the movie delivers a unexpectedly high-quality piece of story with natural ups and downs that all of us may have on our daily life-routine. There are however points where the movie fails to clarify the characters actions, but like many other action-packed thrillers, details are not of the most importance, throughout the length of the film. The important point is that the message that movie tries to deliver, is successfully conveyed through a channel of fun and excitement at one hand, and pure drama on the other hand.",Chronicle

Three teens with absolutely nothing in common suddenly find themselves together when a strange force gives them telekinetic powers. An apparent government conspiracy removes the source of the power, and the boys accept a get out of here from the local park ranger rather than using their new powers to unearth the artifact. Of course, no one trusts their parents enough to share the look-what-I-can-do power.So, the popular kid, the jock, and the down-and-out loser have to deal with being Superman, with all the predictability of Carrie but with no pig blood or nudity so they can have a PG-13 rating. Throw in an abusive alcoholic dad and a mom dying of unknown illness with no insurance; there is simply no character in the film who is original.All the while, for reasons never made clear, two kids decide to shoot video. (I know when I'm in the middle of a fight for my life flying ten stories above the streets, I check the framing on my camera too.) On the plus side, the film is blissfully short at 83 minutes. And it comes with 10-plus minutes of trailers.The young cast of relative newcomers justifies my rating of 3/10. Playing stereotypes the young men and one woman rise above the poor material and all are clearly destined for something better. Dane DeHaan and Ashley Hinshaw, in particular, are clearly stars on the rise. DeHaan reveals a depth comparable to DiCaprio or Pacino and I look forward to his next project to see if he really can play anything. Although Hinshaw's role is regretfully small, and her disappearance at the end has no denouement, her flirty journalistic interaction with Alex Russel's character was entertaining and intriguing.

Boy, where to start with this one.First off, for a first-time director AND a first-time screenwriter, both working on a very low budget, this is a very well-made movie; they did a very good job experimenting with the idea of a movie shot solely from the point of view of in-universe cameras, using shots from hand-held cameras, news choppers and CCTV video, just to name a few.The characters are quite fleshed out, given the circumstances, and *gasp* are actually likable. Yeah, when the three mains discover they have superpowers, they start out by pulling pranks and just goofing around. But, then again, can't say I wouldn't do the same thing in their position. The main character, Andrew's, actions are actually believable: He starts out using his powers as a means to increase his social status and his self-esteem, starts becoming a laughingstock, and eventually his anger snowballs into the very intense finale. The dialogue itself all feels very natural, not making any of the characters cartoonishly irritating or unrealistic.I recommend this movie to any fan of superhero movies, or anyone who has actually liked the slew of found footage movies that have flooded the market in recent times.

300,wwillcox561,Chronicle Review,9,7 February 2012,"Chronicle happened to actually be an awesome movie for such a low budget film. It has taken back the dignity of the ""found film"" sub genre back from the Blair Witch Project. The story is basically about a group of 3 teen's who develop telekinetic powers from an unknown energy source. Andrew decides to film their daily lives with having these new powers. While there are really no prominent actors in the movie, the main role Andrew played by Dane DeHaan was so great that I can see him having a very successful future down the road. The supporting actors which are his best friends Matt and Steve also provide some much needed comic relief throughout the movie. The scene with them flying is just absolutely awesome and stuck out as one of my favorite parts of the movie. The last 30 minutes of the movie are just absolutely epic with the different changing camera angles throughout the city like cop car footage, mall security footage and various other news reporter cameras. That is really what got me hooked on this movie and why I've been recommending it to everyone I see.",Chronicle
301,poopiter,Very FUN Movie!,8,6 February 2012,"This was a great movie made up of decent effects, good acting and a solid story. It's not mind blowingly original but it fun to see kids being kids. We're talking 15 mil budget for this movie and its just as if not more enjoyable than its 200 mil budget competition. This is one of those movies that you might have to drag your girlfriend or mom to go see but then they come out liking more than you. My mom went and saw without having a clue other than thinking it was something about a kid with ESP and she loved it. If you can convince someone to go without knowing the plot it will be worth it for them.!!!!SPOILERS!!!! from here on......One thing I wish would have been a little expanded on or done different was the very end. His dialogue should have been a clear message that he will be spending time in an isolated location (Tibet) to strengthen, safely control and understand his abilities so he can use this gift to help people in honor of Steve and Andrew (or something like that).",Chronicle
302,cjbrighton,"Mediocre, not great.",1,5 February 2012,"The whole film is shot using the same camera technique as Cloverfield, intentionally amateurish, disjointed with annoying camera shake during the action scenes. Initially, the dialogue is fast paced but the characters are 2 dimensional so I found little to care about in any of them. They do acquire some depth eventually but the pace of the plot is so slow that for the first 30 minutes I didn't feel any buy-in to the story which is too long in my opinion. Eventually the special effects are well executed and the film kind of redeems itself but then it's over and I was left feeling a little cheated. Shame as the trailers are great and I was expecting a great film however, I would say it's mediocre at best.",Chronicle
303,skm4321,Science Fiction + Found Footage +Super Hero Origin Story= Potent Combo,8,6 February 2012,"Chronicle is a nice movie with no star power that combines the three genre Science Fiction, Found Footage and Super Hero.This is story of three friends Dane DeHaan as Andrew, Michael B. Jordan as Steve and Alex Russell as Matt.Andrew is a shy, a loner and a nobody in his high school.One Day he starts recording his day to day life.His only friend is Matt his cousin.One Day Andrew and Matt together with Steve encounter some inexplicable alien thing which gives them superpowers.What happens to them after that and how they use it and how it affects their friendship and life is the main plot of the movie.All the three boy's acting is superb with Dane impressing me the most as Andrew.Movie's First half is very entertaining and second half is very intense.Due to casting unknown Actors its virtually impossible guess the outcome and who to root for.After the three different types of ordinary teenagers get extraordinary power,their reaction to these situation looks totally plausible and real.During the movie at many points I thought that If I were in position of any one of them,I may also have done the same thing.Uncle Ben's words ""With Great Power comes Great Responsibility"" will surely come in to your mind when you watch this movie.All in all this is a great movie with a great climax.From start to end this movie never seem slow or loses steam.Its final ten to twenty minutes are epic.Character Development is phenomenal.So watch it if you haven't watched it already.",Chronicle
304,hbk_nwo33,Refreshing take on the superhero genre,10,25 August 2013,"Chronicle is a fresh new take on both the hand-held camera genre and the superhero film. It tells an engaging story about coming-of-age, friendship, family and how power effects people in different ways. The films moral take on the responsibility that comes with power isn't its only message, with it showing how the way people treat each other at all times, no matter how small it initially seems, can lead to much bigger consequences.Fantastic performances from its great cast, especially the three stars (Dane DeHaan, Alex Russell and Michael B. Jordan) but also some solid supporting performances from Michael Kelly, Ashley Hinshaw and Bo Petersen. The directing and writing from the combination of Josh Trank and Max Landis is perfectly on target, and the cinematography from Matthew Jensen all contribute to make this a refreshing and bold effort that has deservedly launched the careers of all involved.****SPOILERS BELOW***** At its heart Chronicle is the tragic tale of the rise and fall of the world's first, and currently only, supervillain. Dane DeHaan's Andrew Detmer is a character that is doomed for misery from the very beginning, and despite all of the things going on around him, Chronicle is truly his tale.Everything about the film is tragedy, showing how power can easily corrupt, yet still the story running in the background is one of morals and heroism, with the incorruptible Matt being the traditional superhero, yet playing a severe back seat in the movie. The film is a thoroughly refreshing take on the superhero genre, because we see everything through the eyes of what would normally be the villain of the piece. This is not just because he is the main cameraman in the hand-held styling, but because everything is focused on his story. His family life, his rise and fall of a social life and the goodness within him crumbling underneath the pressures of society.We feel all of this so strongly due to the performance of DeHaan and the direction of Josh Trank. The choppy cuts between shots as Andrew pauses his camera give a real personal and amateur (in a good way) feel to the piece, as if shot by the character himself. The first sky-high flying scene for example made you feel like you were Andrew, flying above the world and through the clouds, immersing the viewer better than 95% of 3D films ever do. The more nuanced shots of Andrew simply lying around whilst we hear the background noise of his father are almost more effective in portraying his home life than the scenes where his father gets physical with him. Andrew's dream of visiting Tibet because of how peaceful it is shows how different a life he could have led if external circumstances had been different, he never really wanted to harm, he just got driven to it and broke. This is perfectly mirrored by the closing scene as Matt takes his camera there.Michael B. Jordan's performance as Steve gave the character a genuine feel despite his massive popularity and charisma, you never once questioned his sincerity in his friendship with Andrew as he developed into a big brother of sorts to the often secluded outcast. Not to overlook Alex Russell, whose performance as Matt was the closest thing to happiness the film gets. He transforms from the analysing superiority complex he begins with into being the moral spine of the film, the one who prioritises love over the powers, who tries to bring Andrew down to reality and keep him grounded. From beginning to end Matt is always looking out for Andrew, even in their fight at the end, as he looks emotionally shattered by having to kill his cousin to stop his destruction. And even after everything he still takes Andrew (or a symbolisation of him anyway) to Tibet, his dream location, with a heartfelt goodbye. Matt himself suffers heaps of tragedy, losing a friend in Steve, having to kill his own cousin and having to leave behind the girl of his dreams (Ashley Hinshaw's Casey) who he had finally gotten after years as he has to take to the road to help save the world whilst avoiding being captured for having powers. He is a true superhero.Thanks the scripting and the grounded performances from its cast, the film feels authentic. From the way the students act and speak at school to the up-and-down behaviour of his alcoholic and grieving father and the reaction that the public display of powers gets at the end (onlookers immediately filming on phones in awe whilst the police immediately react by viewing it as a threat) it all seems natural to the way people would really behave.The story reminds me somewhat of Carrie, of which it no doubt took influence, but it sees Andrew's character experience more in the way of natural friendship and warmth from his mother, cousin Matt and his bonding with Steve. His father takes on the role of Margaret White, being the abusive parent that ultimately brings about the downfall of the tragic teenager, seeing him turn on his new best friend Steve that sets in motion the beginning of his ultimate mental collapse.The one thing I do question, although it feels minor in the overall picture of things, is what the final fight was being filmed on. During the section at the statue we get a couple of different close-up angles of Matt, but there doesn't appear to be any cameras close to them whenever the shot is distant. Only a small gripe, but still seemed odd as I viewed it.",Chronicle
305,PhoebeDay,An Interesting Twist on an Overused Plot,9,28 October 2016,"So many movies consist of a band of unlikely people who are brought together by something intense - it's also common nowadays for films to be about teenagers acquiring powers. However, Chronicle is a new twist on the cliché. The way of filming is already the first obvious twist as it is shot in ""found footage"" style. The added fact that the camera is supposedly moved by the boys mind is even more interesting. Not only did the cinematography bring a fresh take on such a common basic story, the actual plot in it's entirety really added a boost of something new. I can't say too much as I don't want to spoil the movie, but I would highly recommend this movie to somebody who's interested in ""found footage"" style of films and films that defy the clichés.",Chronicle
306,petesmithhome,Really enjoyed this film! Pure fantasy fun.,8,18 February 2012,"Saw the trailer and went to see this with my daughter. I really enjoyed it as it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. Its pure fantasy and you have to be able to watch without judging the fact that a lot of what you are seeing is a bit ridiculous, take it for what it is, a fantasy film. It has so many emotions in it and the scenario is excellent. Really made me think. It has guilt, hatred, sadness, fun, confusion and a lot more. One minute i was smiling and laughing and literally the next I felt a tear in my eye. My only reason for not giving it a ten is that I thought it was too short. Especially the last 30 minutes seem to be rushed and I left the cinema wanting more. If you are able to let your imagination run wild, don't miss this!",Chronicle

I never looked hard enough to notice it was a 'found footage"" as they are calling it film which if I had I would never have rented it. Thankfully I did not have the money to go see this in the theater or I would have been demanding my money back early on and would have been right. There was nothing worth watching until about 2/3 of the way into the movie. By then your so drunk from the shaky camera which by the way some times you think ""oh the camera is gone now it's a real movie"" and then Oh crap the jerk got the camera again. At times you wish someone would break it (and they do try but not well enough) There was no real plot there was no sympathy for any of the actors. there was nothing. I feel asleep and missed like 20 minutes of the movie and I am thankful. I did not miss anything really it was all crap. super hero? there were no super hero's in this movie only super villains and super greed. Super heroes would not let their girl friend go with them to fight someone that they know was capable of killing everyone.",Chronicle
308,dcastellani,Underrated is the review,8,27 June 2020,"I saw this film back in 2012 when it came out but I never understood why it wasn't talked about more. As far as found footage films go, in my opinion this is the most original one. The way they use the characters powers to actually control the camera is just a really cool concept, and it is truly unique to this film. And as a movie goes it's enjoyable. These 3 high schoolers discover a rock underground and it gives them powers. The main character Andrew is definitely an outcast who comes from a broken home with a drunk abusive father, and his mother who is dying from a disease. Besides his home life he is a social misfit who is rejected and bullied by the majority of his peers. The movie at its core is the transition of Andrew from good boy outcast to a straight up villain. As a film it fires on all cylinders from story to characters to cinematography. It is definitely worth a watch, especially if you're a fan of found footage.",Chronicle
309,gerbildad,The moral of the story: DO NOT give a troubled teen superpowers!,9,18 April 2017,"Every now and then, a movie comes along with unknown actors and a low budget, but then turns out to be far better than you'd ever believe. This is such a movie. The acting is first rate, the plot intriguing, and the characters develop well as the plot unfolds. There are even some mind-blowing special effects that are quite well done.It's about three teenagers who discover they have developed superpowers. The three have distinct personalities, and handle their new abilities in different ways. The story moves from teenage awkwardness to wonder, then spirals tragically out of control, with some spectacular CGI along the way.The acting by the three leads is very natural and convincing. Andrew's father on the other hand was truly monstrous; so bad some may find it strains credulity. Unfortunately though, there are real people like that out there; if you find the father's character unbelievable just thank your lucky stars.I'll give this movie 9/10 because it exceeded expectations so spectacularly. So...why is this movie not more well known?",Chronicle
310,ripleyclone8,Fresh take on an ongoing genre,7,3 February 2012,"I really liked Chronicle mainly because they fleshed the story out and made a ""big"" film. Many of these found footage films are very minimalistic and small in their takings. Chronicle slowly builds up the ""BIG EPIC"" feel of a film that so many other found-footage films don't even adhere to. The characters were believable and you felt the pain these characters were experiencing. It was a fun ride and this ""found-footage"" genre has finally gone somewhere else other than just to demons, ghosts or zombies, which was nice. Plus the ending was satisfactory. It was short but ""BIG"" and it left a little light and the end of a tunnel to explore this storyline further.Of course it had increments of CGI placed all over the film but with a storyline like this, well what else could you do? One of my biggest pet-peeves with the found footage genre is the length of these films. There so damn short, ranging from just an hour to an hour and half. With a movie like this, a bigger budget and a more lengthy film would of made this movie a golden gem in the found-footage genre of cinema. But then again a lot of these ""found footage"" films tend to shorten up the film and use shock value as their key support. That to me is what lessens these movies from being even greater. There incredibly short and leave no time to expand on the characters and flesh out the storyline.Overall, Chronicle was a fun-ride. It was like experiencing the origins of some superhero but through the lens of a camera. The powers these three characters conceived showed just how dangerous they can be if not disciplined to ""think before you act"". Chronicle also gave these three teenage characters the ability to act out a ""realistic"" life style in this film without having them to suit them up as Batman or Superman. It wasn't far-fetched. I would say Chronicle is like, ""What if a few teenage boys discovered some superpowers and didn't know their limits."" That is a realistic portrayal of a superhero. Every DC or Marvel Superhero is somehow able to discipline themselves and never go outside the box when discovering their powers. This film took you out of the suit, out of the fantasy world and placed a superhero in our world today. Thats what I really enjoyed about it. Chronicle gave you a glimpse of the true potential of a person with such powers who didn't abide in a world of limits. Plenty of action and suspense. A fun Friday-night film to see with your friends if you have got nothing better to do. I'm sure you won't regret it.My verdict: A fresh take to a continuing genre of cameras and shaking action/horror. Gives a super-hero twist to these kinds of films and really emboldens what a young superhero is all about in a realistic kind of way. I give it a 7 out 10. It wasn't a perfect gem of a film but if you enjoy ""Found Footage"" movies like myself, you will most likely really enjoy this.",Chronicle
311,StInSanDiego,Interesting premise,8,18 April 2012,"Chronicle is nicely directed by Josh Trank, and well written by Max Landis and Trank (story with Landis).The actors, which include Alex Russell, Michael B.

As they try to learn to master these new posers and use them to their liking, their lives move toward a darker.There are some choices made with camera moves that are interesting.Overall, the movie kept my interest and there were only a couple of times where I looked at the time. And the ending is pretty interesting as well.This should receive some commercial success, given that apparently it was made for a very low budget.",Chronicle
312,davylevine,Excellent Sci-Fi film that transcends the usual,8,19 May 2012,"I was surprised by how much my wife and I both liked this film. It brings to mind Attack the Block and Super 8, but surpasses those in depth of character, script, humor and special effects. The special effects are astounding. But the depth of character surpasses the kitsch that most special effects really are, in this age of CGI and other computer generated marvels. We found ourselves really liking and caring about the main character, a quiet, smart, nerdy kid who is bullied both at home and at school. His creative outlet is amateur filming, which is a theme that runs through the movie and which lends itself very well to the idea of an Indy produced, hand-held camera that gives an otherwise unbelievable film its cinema verite quality. This serves to make the special effects even more memorable and believable, since the boys' powers are so understated and minimized at first. Great script, beautiful characterizations, heartfelt sympathy for teens, the whole enlivened by humorous and believable teenage testosterone ... and some real magic. I had some very minor issues with the film, but this did not prevent me -- and my wife, who usually can't sit through a real sci-fi film -- from enjoying this nearly perfectly realized film. Thoroughly enjoyable and highly recommended.",Chronicle

And don't you think this Paranormal activity style of cameras is getting too much now? The movie would have been a 4 if not for it. I wish I hadn't seen this as it is clearly just for dumb teenagers.Special effects are not great, cinematography, there isn't one, music, not good at all, story, beyond awful, acting is not too bad, but not good either.

315,TheTVSamurai,Chronicle: A Unique and Creative Approach to a Superhero Movie,7,12 February 2012,"A friend of mine recommended this movie and suggested I write a review about it...so there I was last night in a nearly empty theatre with a bunch of my buddies waiting for Chronicle to start. I've read a few reviews on the film before watching it and people either loved it for what it is or found it lame. Here's what I thought.For those who don't know much about the movie, the story centers around 3 teenagers who happen to stumble upon a blue glowing giant meteor and gain super powers from it. The whole film is shot with a ""found footage"" method, meaning its shot in a documentary type style with a hand-held camera, think of movies like, Cloverfield, Catfish, Paranormal Activity and The Blair Witch Project. So it's safe to say, if you are not fan of that type of filmmaking, this movie might not be for you but having said that, I personally think that Chronicle does it in a pretty creative way that makes it different from the other films I've listed above especially since its a film about superheroes and superpowers. If I had to choose, I'd say this film is much more like Cloverfield in the sense its using found footage containing a lot of action sequences where as other films are usually portrayed like a reality TV series or a documentary film.The three main characters include: the main camera man of the film, Andrew Detmer (Dane DeHann), Matt Garetty (Alex Russell) and Steve Montgomery (Michael B. Jordan, best known as the QB for East Dillon in Friday Night Lights). Andrew is a very emotionally disturbed individual, who is the victim of insulting jokes, school bullies and a drunk abusive father. Andrew's cousin, Matt is a level headed all around cool, nice guy of the group. And Steve is the funny, popular teen who's running for school president. The three teens all gain super powers from the aforementioned meteor, giving them telekentic abilities, super human strength and the ability to fly—all while giving the 3 of them a special bond and connection with one another. The three start off using their powers as practical jokes which include a lot of laugh out loud moments in a American Pie-esqe manner but to no one surprises, it soon gets them into a lot of serious trouble, all self inflicted—mainly by Andrew. It takes awhile to get use to the camera style because throughout most of the film, its told through the eyes of Andrew who's basically a newbie cameraman, meaning there's a lot of hand shakiness but as the film progresses, (much like his superpowers and camera skills) the camera-work becomes more and more smoother and we also start to see the film told through other different cameras as well. I was pretty impressed with all the flying sequences because I don't think I've seen anything from the eyes of the ""flyer"" to this degree. A lot of very visually satisfying shots, great action sequences and like I said, a lot of funny moments.

316,pantelisandreou96,Discover the amazing power,8,19 May 2012,"When three high school friends discover a mysterious source of power, their lives are suddenly turned upside down, as their newfound abilities make their wildest dreams a reality. At first, everything plays out exactly the way you'd imagine a couple of teenagers would use their powers; as in goofing around with innocent pranks and showing off to the ladies. But like the poster says: it's all fun and games until everybody gets hurt. For as a more darker side begins to emerge along with the discovery of their gifts, their bonds of friendship become ever more strained, leading up to a dire and catastrophic turn of events, where nothing can no longer be controlled and the darkness gets the better of them. If you think this sounds like the premise for a great and awesome movie, it's because that's exactly what it is. Fun-filled and exhilarating, I wasn't bored for a single second, and it kept on topping itself with progressively cooler special effects. The fact that almost every actor in it is completely unknown to me, only benefited the film as it made it feel more genuine. And it's this goosebump-inducing sense of realism, that makes it such a spellbinding watch. My only complaint as far as the visuals go, is that many of the moments where they fly around are too obviously done by wire. You'd think with how much technology has evolved in the past 10 years, that they'd be able to make it more convincing, but unfortunately it doesn't look much better than it did in the ""olden days"". I was also very annoyed by how they *spoiler alert* killed off one of my favourite characters so early on in the movie. Especially as I considered him the best of the three lead actors *end of spoiler*. In all other regards, however, this was a phenomenally entertaining experience. It was like watching one of my own dreams on screen, in which I've fantasized about having superpowers. And although rooted in familiar themes, found in hundreds of other Hollywood features, the pragmatic execution and natural character behavior, makes you fully invested in everything that's happening. So as far as found-footage fare goes, this was quite the mind-blowing success. A fresh, action-packed and impressively made sci-fi yarn, that treats its audience with dignity, while leaving you with an appetite for more and the hope for a continuous sequel. 8/10",Chronicle
317,friendly_poison,A Found Footage Masterpiece,8,12 May 2014,"Just finished watching this, after the encouragement of of my girlfriend and I was extremely impressed, needless to say this is a landmark in the the genre of 'found footage'.I recently saw 'The Blair Witch Project' and I was introduced into a world of apparent, 'realism' in film. A medium so simple of taking a camcorder and simply recording your normal life or say heading into a forest to document a ghost chase, becomes all the more personal and vivid when played out in a film-within a film environment.Chronicle continues this effective display of realism with perfection in this supernatural drama, directed brilliantly by Josh Trank. The film follows 3 high school students, Andrew (Dane DeHaan), Matt (Alex Russell) and Steve (Michael B. Jordan) as they stray away from a late night party into a strange pit, where, after a little exploring they discover a large, strange and glowing crystal that apparently bestows telekinetic powers upon the trio. At first the three friends playfully experiment and get to grips with their new found powers, such as messing with patrons in supermarkets and even moving parked cars to test themselves but also eventually expand outwards into even more impressive feats. Flying.Out of the three, the stand out performance is from DeHaan's, Andrew. He lives a shy, reclusive life as he is frequently bullied at school and is abused mentally and physically by his alcoholic father, Michael (Richard Detmer). From the get go, Andrew purchases a camera to document his life, forming the base angle from which the movie is viewed. As the film goes on, Andrew, having grown more powerful, begins to telekinetic move the camera around, giving the audience an excellent view into not only the story as it unfolds but the evolution of Andrew and the rest of the cast.The character development is deep and relationships between the three protagonists is well written and translates well to the screen. The films message also speaks out on the topics of loneliness, social awkwardness, acceptance and the true depth of power.If you're a fan of the 'found footage' or, hell, even if you aren't. I highly recommend this awesome movie, especially if you've had problems in high/senior school in your youth (who hasn't right?). You may learn a lot about yourself, others and what it means to be human after all.I'll catch you guys another way, another time.FP",Chronicle

I feel like it makes me feel like I'm in the movie and actually seeing what's going on. I think this movie have done a great job on that. This movie, even though the whole movie was about someone filming, it didn't look like a work of an amateur. I liked how they involved all those security camera and other people's camera as part of the movie. I liked the character change in this movie too. The actors have fair skills of acting. The story was kind of predictable. However, I think the cinematography had covered all those imperfection of this movie. I believe this to be one of my favorite and the best (in my opinion) movie that I watched until now. I really liked the cinematography and all that.",Chronicle
319,Krisp8888,"A surprisingly original, dark, and simply phenomenal film.",9,26 February 2012,"*Minor spoilers if any. Nothing further than what is shown in the trailer. I wasn't overly interested in this movie upon release. The superhero genre is very overdone, as is the ""found footage"" genre(and most films use the ""found footage"" technique just to make up for a weak plot line). This film was (surprisingly) very original, unlike anything I have ever seen. This is not a masterpiece, I wouldn't call it ""Brilliant"", but it is very original, and thoroughly enjoyable. The premise is that 3 teenagers(Matt, Andrew, and Steve) get ""Superpowers"" from a mysterious underground cave. When they discover these ""Powers"", they begin strengthening them, and having a lot of fun int he process. I think the writer of this film sat around and asked himself ""What would I do if I got superpowers""? As in most films about ""Superheroes"", they are trying to save the day. In ""Chronicle"", they are throwing a football around in the clouds. The first half continues on that route, with them using these powers to prank unsuspecting and baffled people. This is a surprisingly entertaining and hilarious thing to watch. Then when we get to the second half of the film, it begins pulling viewers further and further down an emotionally riveting spiral downward, as things take a dark turn. Andrew we have developed through the first half as a bit of an outcast that is dealing with am abusive father and a dying mother(whom he loves dearly). His home-life has turned Andrew into a rather disturbed boy.Andrew emotionally is going through this downfall, and we are pulled right into it with him. What started as a fun and downright hilarious film becomes very dark, and very disturbing.By a certain point of the film, Andrew could easily be classified as mentally ill, and being mentally ill and having these powers are not a good combination. This is a fun, hilarious, intriguing, emotionally compelling, intense, and at times disturbing film all in one(and at only 83 minutes to boot!).I was especially skeptical of the ""Found-Footage"" technique, though I thought it was done very well here. It wasn't so much ""Found-Footage"" as about half the film being shot from a different point of view(whether it be Andrew's camera, Security Camera's in a hospital, Security Camera's in a bank, etc.). And roughly half of the movie is filmed in the standard form.I have already seen ""Chronicle"" twice, and would see it a third time in a heartbeat. As of now, this is easily my favorite film of 2012(with Source Code winning that award for the year of 2011). If you haven't seen ""Chronicle"", I highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys a great movie. Come on, I am somebody who traditionally doesn't like superhero or ""found footage"" movies! If I loved it, who wouldn't?!",Chronicle
320,RandomViewer,Astonishingly good filmmaking crippled by the choice of the lead actor.,7,8 January 2013,"That this movie was (reportedly) made for $12 million is a wake-up call for Hollywood; to achieve what it does on this budget shames the entire industry. It is a remarkably fresh take on the superhero genre made by someone who understands that many people under 40 are getting better stories -and a sense of wonder- from the best video games, rather than movies.The special effects are astoundingly good, and, for once, are at the service of the story; sparingly where necessary, before building up to a stunning climax in the last third. They were not only more effective and superior than what is usually seen in a $150M production, they were used in a smarter and more convincing fashion.The tempo of the story is managed perfectly over the 90-odd minutes, and some of the actors involved would seem to have a big future. The black dude has the charisma of a Denzel Washington; he, the cousin and the filmmaker/girlfriend all complete their roles perfectly, without any of the self-aware over-acting prevalent in most studio movies these days.The only negative for me was a big one; I nearly turned it off after the first ten minutes due to the fact that the lead character was possibly the most whiny, wet and irritating I have ever seen in a film. It wasn't that he stood out more due to the higher standards being set everywhere else, because I was ready to turn it off before knowing how good the rest of the movie would turn out to be.I get it that a huge part of the movie was the contrast provided when a powerless, submissive protagonist gains extraordinary power, yet even the most determinedly unsympathetic anti-heroes pale in comparison to this guy. As the victim of many circumstances out of his control, even when he turned evil I felt like there should have been at least some stage where I gave a sh*t but this never happened. Much of this has to do with how the character was written, yet I think literally any other actor playing that character would have made for a better film.I don't know the history of the director, the cinematographer or the writers of the script; if they are all unknowns then what they achieved here is even more impressive.

News flash!!! It's a freaking movie!!! Movies are generally a replacement for theatrical plays. The main difference is that movies allowed the audience to view the actors doing things that were not possible on a regular stage. They are supposed to have a story line, no really, movies really are supposed to have one. This may be too hard for some people to believe, but that's what movies originally were supposed to do, they were supposed to have a story. Whoa, this just might be to much for people these days to believe.That's right folks, movies were originally intended to be a type of stage act, a play, but now on a big screen. Either 2, or 3 acts, some high points and some low points. Heck you could even try for 4 acts if it can still be decent.Some of these director's might have so much money that they can just make a movie that is pure dog doodoo and it won't hurt their budget, but people are being starved for a real story these days.I just hate going to the movies lately! Everything I have gone to see in the last year has been extremely disappointing! I used to go to the movies all the time from 1995-2005 and was seldom disappointed. In the last 2-3 years I have seldom been satisfied.Well, I guess I should get to my review, so heads up:***********************Spoiler Alert!!!***********************OK, so Chronicle is using yet again the ""home camera shooting"" fashion, like that other extremely disappointing series of movies that started with ""Cloverfield"" (2008). Yes, for those of you who agree that it totally sucks, and detracts from an actually enjoyable movie going experience, it sucks very much.I was immediately turned off once I realized that it was shot in this style, but I decided not to be completely closed off to what it might offer. I sat patiently, waiting and praying for something still worth watching. As the minutes went by the words of my friend came into my mind, ""try not to have so many expectations when you go to the movies."" He gave me that advice because I hated another movie I saw recently that he enjoyed.Nevertheless Chronicle continued to get worse with every passing minute. Three teenage boys, a younger brother, an older brother, and a friend find some hole in the ground and explore it. They find some large foreign object, and then it cuts to nothing. The next time you see them they have telekinetic powers and begin to experiment with them.Horrible story plot points, no explanation is given as to how this happens. The audience is just introduced to the fact that these kids somehow gain telekinesis, so brace yourselves for that one. I suppose we don't need a complete drawn out map, but it wouldn't hurt to at least have a tiny bit of explanation.They continue to experiment and soon realize they have a power much greater then originally recognized. They can do many things with it including flying. Eventually, one of them hurts someone and they feel bad because of it. They try to make some rules to control their powers but eventually give into the darker halves of their own conscientiousness.*******************NO MORE SPOILER PAST THIS POINT******************This movie does contain the elements of a story line, but still falls short of clever plot points, good screen play, and lacks true cinematography.I'm awfully sick of the Cloverfield cinematography. One was way more than enough directors, yes I'm directing this comment directly to Hollywood directors!!! Stop using this God awful type of cinematography!!! IT SUCKS!!!!!!It's amazing that a movie with an actual story line (albeit a God awful one)like this can still make a movie like ""The Tree of Life"" (2011) seem not as bad as it really was. I still think The Tree of Life is worse.A person should not have to be deciding which movie was worse, please make something that amount to more than horse pucky on the side of the road directors!!! Gosh!",Chronicle

I really really liked how they showed what you could actually if you had superpowers in the real world. But I just wanted more, you know? Like, what would it be like to fly all the way to the Tibet by yourself? How long would it take? What other crazy stuff can you do? How can you make money with the power?
PS: NOT BY FREAKING STEALING! Sorry, that part was terrible, he could make money so many ways with that power, like, you know, magic? Transporting stuff? Being a camera man?

It just wasn't worth the effort.I was hoping for so much more and it didn't deliver. Maybe it's just me. There seems to be a lot I decent reviews out there and critics seemed to think it was decent.

324,swmayer,"A film about the people with the powers, instead of just the powers.",8,29 April 2012,"All right, just got back from seeing twenty-seven-year-old Josh Trank's first blockbuster: Chronicle. I've got to say knowing you can make films like this at my age makes me feel like I'm way behind the curve. The first ninety percent of this flick is absolutely stacked with perfect pacing, real characters, and a great new twist on an old story (mainly, teenagers develop some sort of power and have to figure out to cope with it). What makes Chronicle unique is how raw it feels. It doesn't have the smooth cuts and pans and close-ups of a traditional film. Certainly it's not the first film of its visual type: The Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield come to mind, but this film manages to bring a whole new element into the style that makes it more than just a movie with a wobbly camera and a ""found footage"" trope. First off all, the movie uses more than one camera. Instead of focusing on just one camcorder and a found tape, this film pieces together ""natural"" camera footage (mainly from three separate camcorders but also later from news and security cameras). This gives the director more freedom to cut to characters in different places. Though, it seems the more the director sticks with the two cameras owned by the three main characters, the more the film seems to retain that raw, natural feel. The last ten percent or so of the film, where Trank uses a lot of extra cameras to change his shots up, I feel like the film loses a lot of the realistic credibility it worked so hard to build up. But, overall, this film breaks new ground in the ""handy-cam"" genre.From here on out, beware of spoilers. The film begins with no opening credits. It sets up the audience with an immediate introduction to the owner of the camera, Andrew. Andrew runs the camera to try and record his life. He's a loner with an abusive father and no friends to speak of. His cousin, Alex has a limited relationship with Andrew, though it is hinted at they were closer when they were younger. While at a party, a very popular kid name Steve rushes up to Andrew and tells him to bring his camera along. From there, the three become their own clique, tied together by an inexplicable happening late that night that endows them all with telekinetic powers. From there, the three boys have to deal with their original (teenager) problems but with the addition of having to learn how to harness this power, when it is appropriate to use it, and how to keep it in check when emotions grow hot. This truly is where this film leaves the other handy-cam films behind. It tackles the upsides and downsides of having powers, without resorting to the kids donning suits and attempting to emulate their favorite comic book heroes. Instead, these kids use their powers in the ways that come natural to each of them — for reasons that seem natural to their problems, desires, and personalities. A unique and realistic relationship is built between the three of them, and the sort of interior, subtle power struggle in the group keeps the film about people instead of about powers.Other, welcome additions to the handy-cam genre are a mixture of great sound, assorted, subtle film textures as we me move from one camera to another, and the unique ability for steady, moving shots due to the camera being utilized by characters with telekinetic abilities. This allows the camera to float during many of the scenes where it wouldn't do to have it jostling around or have it set in a single place. This was a very unique way to solve the problem of wanting those ""theatrical"" kind of shots without breaking the illusion of reality. To some extent, this sense of reality is broken toward the end during a climactic battle scene, where supposedly we are watching footage from news cameras, but it seems too cinematic and doesn't mesh too well with the other camera work.But the film is definitely worth a look. There are more than a few exhilarating moments, moments when the hairs on your arms will stand up, and real, human moments you'll find yourself smirking at these teenage boys that should seem familiar to anyone who went to high school that wasn't an all-girls school.",Chronicle
325,wvanderheiden,Dragging - To say the least,4,1 April 2012,"So, there I went, to the cinemas with a group of friends to watch this movie everybody was so enthusiastic about, at least on the internet. What we discovered was that it was a movie that was never exciting, full of shots that didn't add anything and a character development that was close to zero. Really nothing in this entire movie did strike us as intriguing, refreshing, interesting or exciting. To us it looked like the directors didn't have the script ready and tried to take shots and add it to the movie or it wouldn't even last the full 85 minutes. We left the cinema disappointed. Disappointed as there was no proper strong build-up, disappointed as there was no real tension and disappointed because the ending was to short of a thrill to be exciting and make us leave the cinema with a better feeling.To sum up the errors: 1. They get their powers from some stone underground. What is this for stone? Where did it came from? Why was it there? No answer is given. 2. His mom is very sick and his father is a drunk. Is that to create pity for the main character? And if so, perhaps the main character could get a job to help for the med-costs or go to the police about his father? The issues are known but nobody or nothing is dealing with it. 3. After they touched the stone they can move things but suddenly they can fly in the air as well, negclecting all normal effects that would have on your lungs and head and so on and so on.I can continue with this list for a while but I'll save you the time.Conclusion for us was: Don't offer your friends to go and watch this movie, don't waste time to rent the DVD or Bluray, let alone buy it. For us it was a waste of time. The only for us that was comforting was for the fact that we were there as a group of friends.We all expected an impressive movie but the ratings it gets online don't add up to our own opinion and the ones we heard around us since then. Really, don't go and watch this movie. It's crap, unfinished and too predictable.",Chronicle
326,DoctorKingSchultz,"A Great Development in the ""Found-Footage"" Genre",8,22 February 2012,"I went into Chronicle with expectations unusually high for a film like this; I had previously noticed several positive reviews, and a high IMDb score. By no means confirmation of a good movie, but it gave me hope. I also kept in mind previous attempts at this style of film making. I enjoyed Cloverfield, and The Blair Witch Project was okay, but the shaky-cam and intensity of these films never really interested me. Especially the Paranormal Activity films.Anyway, as you can tell by my score given, Chronicle is different. It's set up very well. Andrew, our protagonist, is bullied and a bit antisocial. He has a mother dying of some unnamed disease and a violent alcoholic of a father. In his boredom, Andrew decides to start filming his day-to-day life. Whether or not the character believed this would help his social life, is debatable. But it's all for establishing the world of Chronicle.Andrew is accompanied by his cousin, Matt, and Steve, who is running for class president. I was pleased to see that the writers didn't have the typical ""popular kid bullies outsider"" type of thing going on. If anything, Steve is the kindest and most likable character in the film. When attending a rave, the three guys (two of them clearly under the influence) stumble upon what appears to be a hole in the ground that is emitting slight tremors. They go inside, see some weird stuff, and it's history from there: they have superpowers.Next we see the guys in someone's backyard, messing around, levitating a baseball. And here's where the movie gets good. It's just FUN to see these guys fool around with their newfound powers. It's believable stuff. Just goofing off. And they get more powerful. They can fly. They're having fun. They're bonding. But when Andrew starts to abuse his power, we see a gap put between the boys. It's the classic story of the weak man given the ultimate power.Andrew becomes the strongest of the three, and he knows it. He believes he has become the ""apex predator"", which really is an accurate description. ""You don't feel guilty when you squash a fly"" Andrew says to the camera. It's true; compared to Andrew, everyone else is a fly. Even Steve and Matt. But not until the end of the film does he really use his power as a form of leverage. But when Andrew becomes angry, instigated by his father, he takes it out on everyone and everything around him. And that was another great part of the film. Seeing what was basically a battle between two superheroes in downtown Seattle from the perspective of hand-held and security cameras. It's exciting stuff.The drama in the film is often hard-hitting, especially the pivotal moment I won't spoil here. I think it's because we get to know these characters as who they are; teenage boys. We see them around their friends, being open and honest. That's what makes what would otherwise be meaningless important.I'm sure Chronicle won't be the last of these found-footage films (I'm trying to think of another term for them; I sound redundant!) but in a genre that is growing by the day and often times getting worse with each release, Chronicle stands out. Hopefully it influences a wave of other films of it's genre. And I'm going to go on record and say that I think that Chronicle is the best of it's kind yet.",Chronicle
327,cgsoldier22,Awesome and Entertaining,9,3 February 2012,"Chronicle was surprisingly a good film. You can't hate on this movie because of the ""childish pranks"" they pulled. All the humor and pranks made it feel more realistic. If 3 teens suddenly got superpowers, I really doubt they would say lets become superheroes. No. They would go out and discover new things and just have some good fun. Which is what they did.The hand-held camera had a better twist to it. Now the character can control it through his head. Obviously through telekenesis. The acting is great for the young actors. Effects were awesome, especially during the breathtaking flying scenes.Andrew's turn to the dark side was obviously going to become the plot, but it was still very cool to watch because you almost felt bad for him. Until the end and you'll understand why you don't feel bad anymore.Overall an awesome movie to go see with your friends. First half you will just laugh at the stunts they pull, the second half you will just sit there in awe at the screen! Highly recommended!",Chronicle

A couple of regular kids find themselves with super- human powers and have to come to terms with this new, amazing, scare reality like only teenagers know how: through experimentation - the good, the bad, the ugly. The plot, I felt, didn't know where it wanted to go. I think whoever wrote the script knew he/she had a great concept, but just couldn't take it to where it needed to go; like 2/3 of the way through, a big chuck of cryptonite fell onto the writer's lap. Also, the hand-held camera action... it had credibility for about three scenes... then the reasons for having to constantly film lost all credibility. All up, had huge potential, but a few obvious and major flaws turned it into a bit of a tomato.",Chronicle
329,brownfrichard,"Good, Boring, Bad, Worse",4,8 February 2012,"There's a quote attributed to Will Rogers, a very practical guy: When you find yourself stuck in a hole, stop digging. I offer this aphorism for consideration to the lead character Andrew in Chronicle and to the filmmakers behind Chronicle as well. Andrew, a shy teenager, finds himself part of a trio of boys who discover a strange crystal artifact in an underground cavern. The crystal, for some reason, gives the boys telekinetic powers. They can move objects with their minds and even figure out how to fly above the clouds. The external benefits of Andrew's new physical power include making new friends, becoming popular at school and even attracting the interest of girls. But ultimately Andrew's damaged ego and personal problems at home are more powerful than his abilities his father is an abusive drunk and his mother has a terminal illness. As Andrew's telekinetic powers strengthen, his emotional self-control weakens. Instead of being a hero, he becomes a menace of violence and destruction. The ""chronicle"" part of this is that the whole movie is shot in so called ""found footage"" style. I call it faux-verite. Andrew carries a video camera and his recording of everything that happens is our viewpoint into his rise and fall. There are a lot of movies using faux-verite but experimenting with the form, Chronicle ventures into original territory. I like the special effects work of the suspended objects and flying teenagers. I also like the story in the first two thirds a lot. Is all this really happening to Andrew or are we a voyeur into his fantasy life? Is this an origin story of Andrew as a comic book style hero, or super villain? There are probably a hundred interesting places Chronicle could have taken us but it doesn't go to any of them. Instead the story runs out of gas creatively and begins to get boring, even at under 85 minutes. In the desperate feeling last act, Andrew goes on an I-can-destroy-you-all-if-I-chose power binge. The filmmakers have no idea what to do with their own character. So they drag Andrew into a hole of explosions, nihilism, and waste. Unfortunately, Andrew lacks the ability to think of any better solution than to just keep making things worse. In the same manner Chronicle goes from good, to boring, to bad, to worse. I should mention that I saw a strong homoerotic subtext here as Andrew's fantasy-come-to life seems to be finding a phallic object in a cave and using its secret power to convince attractive, popular boys to runaway with him- just something I was thinking about as I watched this movie go to pieces.",Chronicle

Looks too real to be fake, you almost feel as if your there with these three boys as they're going through all this, their joy is felt by the watchers as the anger from the protagonist. Amazing break through performance from Dane DeHaan, despite the destruction he creates you find yourself loving him, sympathizing with his anger, crying at the end. I'll admit that I balled like a newborn when I first saw it. I just have one question, Where can I meet the writer of this?? I really want to meet them to see if there as dark as the theme of this movie. Every school should show this, has a major anti-bully and anti-abuse theme; tells kids that if you bully someone they're doomed if the bullied gets powers.

What starts out as learning these powers and using them for fun turns into a dark tale of what our generation would do with limitless power.Chronicle. Kics.

I am being very conserved about what I give away but I will tell you, check this film out. I believe you will have a great time. Even if you don't like found footage films, this is great!

334,callumthebeast,Chronicle review,8,23 February 2012,"When the words 'superhero movie' are said, immediate thoughts draw to; Iron man, spider-man, batman and maybe even the awful spoof film of 2006! Competing with such superhero companies as D.C and Marvel and also going against the superheroes that most know and love, is quite a risky plan. Which is why I believe the recent release of Chronicle is such a interesting and important one. Not only does it compete against the big companies, it also offers something new and fresh as the whole film is shot with hand-held cameras.In the spring of last year I went to see X-men first class at my local cinema, and one (of the many!) aspects of the film I disliked was the fact that none of the teenage characters seemed to show any kind of personality, we didn't even get back stories for any of the characters. However in Chronicle strong personalities are shown, and the back story of the main character, Andrew, is sentimental and very fitting. The 3 teenage boys act as any other teenager would if they'd developed super powers, which gives a huge sense of realism to the film , something that is rarely shown in other superhero films. Theirs no cheesy looks at the camera neither any corny catch-phrases, just a realistic depiction of what boys of their age would actually do, which of course is go to the local shop and mess with peoples heads! But behind the fun of the film theirs the sinister yet sentimental back story to Andrew. This back story, which is told throughout the film, makes the crossover from the upbeat banter of the 1st half of the film to the sinister 2nd half, fluent and believable.The whole film is also shot only using hand-held cameras, which at points is a bit ridiculous but is mostly very affective. The aspect of super powers in this film is obviously a huge one but in more ways than one, often the telekinesis power of the boys is used to manoeuvre to camera to show us different shots from different angles, which was used to great effect. However their were other excuses to 'keep rolling' which weren't so good, for example a girl was shooting a video for her blog for the entire length of the film, which I thought was slightly odd and unrealistic, I think they could've shown the girl perspective much more effectively. This however is my only negative point about the film as I thought on the whole it was much more engaging than originally expected, this film has come out from pretty much nowhere and sprung a sigh of relief upon the film industry showing you can compete against D.C and Marvel, and win.* * * *Calum Russell",Chronicle

Combine with teenage angst and pretty good special effects, the picture holds the audience's interest. I thought the two other boys kept backing the vulnerable kid into a corner so he had to strike back. The black kid just would't back off during the T-storm. He should have just waited for the other kid to get hungry or have to take a dump or something and try talking to him later. Similarly the white friend kept resorting to physical force. Or he insisted on rules without explaining why or giving anyone a chance to debate them together. Even as kids all three should have realized that they had to keep their powers a secret, lest they wind up as lab rats in a government laboratory, or names on a hit list, as potential threats to humanity, or targets for religious fanatics for the sin of exercising powers only their deity was entitled to. If only the sensible kids had cited reasons like this for the rules. They should also have put their heads together on how to use their powers to become rich and famous without giving away their secret. Then the bad boy would not have tried to shake down neighborhood toughs for chump change. Just go to a gold mining region and pull all the gold you need out of the ground.

Upon Chronicle's release in 2012, it looked like another smaller budget, Project X mixed with Final Destination high school movie. This of course was not the case at all, and I have decided to rate Chronicle at a 7 out of 10 due to its originality. Since this film has come out we have seen Stranger Things and some superhero movies blend in Chronicle's take on telekinesis and super powers. What is really fun about this movie is that even though it becomes a good guy verses the bad guy story, it's really about the evolution that gets us to that point. We also get to see two blossoming young actors that no one heard of at the time in Dane DeHaan and Michael B. Jordan. The three amigos in this story drive our interest as their friendship becomes stronger, as does their powers. As always, conflict grows when one person does not feel the same as the group. This in turn creates our bigger storyline and fuels the story to its conclusion.I would rate this higher, but I felt it was not quite on the scale of ground breaking movie making. It was however refreshing, and much better than what it's previews suggested. The usage of the title Chronicle was clever. However, the utilization of POV camera shots does get old in some scenes, but is brought back through the creativity of the telekenis camera techniques. If you like super hero movies...you may not love Chronicle. If you're like me, and really done with everything Marvel and DC studios has to throw at you, then perhaps you will enjoy it more than the next Batman vs. Aquaman vs. Antman, or whatever else they can piece together.

There is no explanation as to how the super powers came about and the characters don't spend one moment thinking about how they could change their lives or anyone else's lives for the better. They just do a bunch of dumb things and then they do a bunch of even dumber things. Do yourself a favour and watch anything else. I cannot believe how high the ratings are for this piece of garbage!",Chronicle
344,RLuciano-OneClickFilms,It was OK,5,29 April 2012,"There really isn't much I can say about the film other than I loved the concept. I love the story. I can't stand how it was filmed. Acting was good. Direction was good. I almost shut the DVD off several times specifically because of the concept of how it was filmed. Why they couldn't just shoot it as a regular old movie is beyond me. If they did, I would have given the film a ten without hesitation. Honestly, if there is a sequel and it's filmed the same way this was filmed, I won't watch it. The way this movie was filmed was virtually unwatchable. With that, I give it a 5. It confuses me why movie companies do this, as I find as creatively as they think their idea is, if it detracts from actually enjoying the film, then it shouldn't be used. They completely ignored that.",Chronicle
345,silversmith27,.,10,8 February 2012,"3 friends discover telekinetic abilities in a hole in the ground, literally. But that is where the similarity with the rest of the Superhero movies ends. They don't feel obligated to wear capes and masks and go around the city fighting injustice. They're just being boys with an incredibly powerful toy. That's until Andrew's troubled personality, magnified manifold by his new found power and his ability to wield it, goes completely cuckoo.What's good : The trailer projected Chronicle as an action flick. However its actually a coming-of-age story of a troubled boy, whose rage just gets amplified with his new-found powers. The acting from the small, young cast is good, especially from the 3 leads. Dane DeHaan is brilliant as Andrew, the primary character of interest in Chronicle. He's the guy whose camera is 'chronicling' the developments in this movie. The fact that DeHaan looks like a cross between Leonardo DiCaprio and a very young Mick Jagger adds greater appeal to his character. The special effects are top notch and in spite of the fact that it was filmed on a relatively meager budget of $12-15Mn, Chronicle has at least 4 scenes that any other movie due later this year will struggle to outshine. Keep an eye out for the airplane scene.Whats not : The fact that there is a sequel coming was conveyed rather blatantly in the closing scene. Good thing is, I cant wait for it! There's a lot of shaky camera-work in the beginning which can cause dizziness. But things get easier when Andrew discovers God mode (camera levitation) Verdict : For folks who like sci-fi, superhero films or simply crave an 83 minute adrenaline rush, this is a must watch.My rating : 10/10!",Chronicle
346,azim5431,Awesome movie with a 12 mill. budget,7,5 June 2012,"Chronicle was a nice ride of superhero/alien and the the story of three kids who possessed it. Some really cool and dark concept presented by the young moviemaker. Chronicle not just a 12 million doller indie movie but it has every thing to wow about. Stunning visual, videotaping style of movie (like paranormal activity and jackass but still better) and so much better special effect then what we seeing now-a-days so called ""blockbuster movie"". It has the nice taste of 'next new thing' of movie making. story and screenplay is really top-notch. I am recommending everyone to watch this movie just to get a different taste in movie.",Chronicle
347,Closeone,Why? Screenplay doesn't hold together.,3,27 April 2012,"This movie is way over rated on IMDb. The last Superman was better than that, and it wasn't that good. I can't understand why it is above 7/10...The characters are not bad, neither are the actors. It's quite high school action at the beginning : the jock, the bullshiter, and the alone/creepy one. Right from the start, the screenplay is crystal clear : why are you filming : I'm filming everything now. Okay, why not. Then you see how the BSer one isn't that clever (he doesn't get better through the movie) at the party. Well now that the characters are introduced, beside the jock who comes out of nowhere, we go to the main part : that thing that give them their powers. Then they train, then the creepy one goes batshit insane, then he's killed, then the end.Long story short : if they are getting stronger through the movie, why don't they dig up the whole thing near the end? Why, if they are getting tougher with time starting with fork unable to penetrate their skin, does Andrew gets hurt by the fire/javelin and Matt by the bullet? Why is Andrew using his dad's firefighter uniform, instead of a hoodie and a scarf? Why this same uniform is unable to protect him from the blast at the gas station (despite the fact that his skin is supposed to be way harder than the beginning, and the fact that he is the most powerful)?For me, it's just a teenager action/scifi movie, with not so clever characters. The villain is also the main character and you have to feel sorry for him despite he doesn't make clever/good choices and his life sucks, even when he has power that can help him and his family to get out of this hell hole (which is the main thing of this movie I believe, either way it's almost The Convenant, but without the lame love story). If you're in high school, or if you still think the same way than in high school : this movie is for you. We don't know where their powers come from, how do they work... What is the point of this movie? A sequel? Please, no.",Chronicle
348,devarsh85,Chronicle : A Realistic take on Sci – Fi Action,8,13 February 2012,"Chronicle is an engaging offspring of two very separate genres. Reality based horror / thriller movies and Super Hero's. Never would you have imagined a super hero origins movie being shot with a hand-held camera. They are often related to high octane action sequences and graphics and CGI. Well that thing doesn't change here either but the treatment is creative and thoroughly engaging. If suppose paranormal activity and any super hero movie were to mate, their offspring would have been called ""Chronicle"".I think by now the ""handheld camera"" trick in films is becoming a little stale. Sure, it can help smaller productions and can make some films visually spectacular. However, it seems that it is used in way too many films, usually horror flicks at that. Chronicle, however, is nothing less than a masterpiece at not only the ""found footage"" style, but is also a brand new way of making a superhero movie, mainly because the people it centers on are far from heroes anyway. They are portrayed as everyday people. People with real problems and psychologies. All the larger than life characters of other sci fi or super hero movie is nowhere to be seen here.Read the rest of the review at : http://devlifeintechnicolor.wordpress.com/2012/02/13/chronicle-a- realistic-take-on-sci-fi-action/",Chronicle
349,ShaunAlanAnderson,A Fantastic Handy-cam Film With A Superhero Edge!,8,15 February 2012,"We haven't had much glory with found footage films recently. The Blair Witch Project was just awful, and there were mixed opinions on others like Cloverfield and Paranormal Activity. With a superhero like film, ""Chronicle"" coming out, I didn't know why it needed to be a found footage film. Until I saw the film of course.Now as always in found footage films, there are always small time actors. I thought the majority of the actors done a pretty good job, especially Dane DeHaan (Andrew) who played the character of a socially abused teen with low self esteem and low confidence. The only people that didn't sell it the best was Michael Kelly (Alex's Father) who didn't look like an alcoholic father, and didn't really execute the abusive edge. Another was Alex Russell (Matt) who I think didn't really shine until the end. At the Beginning and mid-way through the film he would just look stoned and not be bothered about the events that happened, like he basically came to terms with it just after the incident. At the end of the film however, he really did come out of his shell and showed his emotional side.I was greatly entertained with the flying sequences, with it being a slightly low budget film, you didn't expect something as breathlessly amazing as that.Overall, the only down side to this film is the excuses they made for it to be a 'handycam' film. There was Andrew who said he wanted to film everything from now on and there was Ashley Hinshaw (Casey) who was filming for her blog. If you had to make all these excuses, then what's the point in making it a found footage film? Nevertheless, the film is truly an experience, with it being a superhero film with a twist! I seriously recommend checking out this film, if you're a big superhero fan like me, this will surely be a fan favourite.Anderson",Chronicle
350,JGomez3248,A Masterpiece of the Genre,10,18 May 2012,"Well where can I start with this masterpiece? Overall this movie was probably the 2nd best superhero movie ever (Dark Knight has to be #1 but this is pretty darn close). The actors did a great job portraying their characters as regular teens who end up gaining powers. The story itself was a little cliché but the entire way the story was went about was amazing. Josh Trank does an excellent job directing this movie. The found-footage effect that the film is filmed through didn't distract from the movie but added another layer of realism. What I think really put this movie above others (The Avengers, Thor, etc) is the emotional connection you build with this movie. The main character of Andrew was extremely relatable to and really made you feel empathetic toward him. When he was abused by his father you really felt bad for the kid. Dane DeHaan, I believe deserves an Oscar Nomination for this performance, yes it was that good. As the movie progresses you slowly see Andrew's slip in to insanity which I felt is a very hard thing to portray in a movie but Trank does this justice. In the end what really set this movie apart from the many others was that it left me spellbound afterward. I could not stop thinking about it for days. I could not get over it. Overall, I could continue for hours but just a warning this is a movie you either love or hate but hey give it a shot! You wont regret it!",Chronicle
351,Metzuda,Definitely Worth Seeting,8,15 February 2012,"Chronicle is a film about three high school boys who, after encountering a mysterious glowing object, develop the ability to move objects around them using only their minds. For a while, they test out their discovery, experimenting and pranking as boys tend to do; soon enough, the movie takes on a darker twist when the boys realize that if gone unchecked, their powers could be fatally dangerous.The film is shot somewhat in the same handy-cam-found-footage style of movies like The Blair Witch Project, The Troll Hunter, Paranormal Activity, and Cloverfield. Fortunately, there isn't a lot of the shake-so-much-I-feel-sick sort of work there is a little, but as the videographer (main character Andrew) improves his skill, the shots also steadily improve.Some have noted that this is a ""superhero origins"" film, but I cannot say that, knowing it would share a bed with so many Marvel-based films Chronicle is in a different league. Chronicle is a well-written, well thought out film, unlike the bulk of the superhero genre. The main characters progress very believably throughout the film, carrying their opening identity from beginning to end, and the actors, in my opinion, did a very good job of portraying the emotion their characters were struggling with, layering their socio-psychological issues deep into the mind of the audience.And that's what set this film apart, for me I couldn't just sit idly through it. Perhaps it was because I found myself identifying with the main character(s) so much but isn't' that the mark of a great film?Do not go into this movie expecting a feel-good, happy ending film. Do not go into this movie expecting to encounter superhuman philanthropists. Do not go into this movie expecting Hollywood-ized high school kids.Go into this film expecting to see a deep struggle between self-worth and unbridled possibility, digging into the bowels of pain and fear experienced through the digital eye of a normal high-school outcast upon whom power and responsibility are suddenly burdened. I really think that is what this film is about.",Chronicle
352,s456123789,Too obvious from the start,5,29 April 2012,"Didn't read a lot about this movie before I watched it and hadn't even fully watched a trailer. But, I thought I would give it a go and see what I thought of it. I normally enjoy the ""found footage"" kind of films, with Cloverfield and Troll hunter being 2 films in the genre I have really enjoyed. Unfortunately this one does not add to that list. For a start off there is no need for the found footage theme. It is just a little gimmick they use but was not needed for the whole film, would have been better if it had been split more 50/50 between that and normal footage.The whole storyline of the film is too obvious, within 10mins of the films starting I had already guessed what would happen and told my wife what I thought the outcome would be. After the end of the movie, it was nice to know I was right yet again. The acting was OK but nothing special. Effects again where fine, but only of the level we have come to expect from most modern movies. The first half of the movie is a little slow but also probably the best. The longer it goes on the more obvious and generic it starts to feel.Such a shame, it had the potential to be so much better but an obvious storyline, average script and acting and an off kilter pace (either to slow or too fast depending on the part of the movie) spoiled it.",Chronicle
353,giveandsee,I am glad they left some secrets,10,15 March 2012,"I thought the movie was awesome.The main secret that the makers of the movie left out was where did the supernatural power come from. The question was asked throughout the movie and even in the end it was brought up again. I feel like for many this was a big problem, but for me I felt it left good curiosity.The overall movie was filmed well. I thought it was going to be a regular story about someone who becomes a here etc. However the movie was formed off of realistic scenarios. Scenerios mixed with the science fiction elements made the movie bring a sense of realness.Something I liked about the movie is the emotion brought out in each character with the gained super power. I feel like each person watching the movie could at least relate to one of them.To sum it up, awesome movie and great actors.",Chronicle
354,rockyfanatic9292,Surprisingly entertaining,8,15 February 2012,"When I first saw the trailer for this movie, it looked sweet but I didn't think they would be able to make an entire film about it. However, i was pleasantly surprised when I got out of this movie. Normally I don't like ""found footage"" films because I never really buy the fact that they are video taping everything. In this film it gave a back story as to why there was a camera, at some points, the characters even remarked about why the camera was there. As i'm sure everyone knows the story is about 3 teenage boys who get superpowers, and one of them seems to be a little more mischievous than the others. Andrew has a pretty messed up home life and that leads to him abusing his powers. The characters could have been developed a little better, but not much to complain about. The plot was very interesting, and got me pretty emotionally invested. Overall, i was very surprised at how entertaining it was and i would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is looking to have a good time. Perfect movie to go see with your friends on a Friday or Saturday night. 8/10 Solid movie",Chronicle

I'm so glad the cinema was full and we watched this instead. I can honestly say I haven't been this entertained and adrenaline rushed since I watched Kick-ass all the way in 2010. This movie is a epic, but not a Lord of the Rings epic, a different kind of epicness. Although this movie is not original in the slightest it is a breath of fresh air, and P.O.V hand-held camera is very well done. For a movie that has no known actors, I got to say some of the performances are great. Especially by Dane DeHaan. Don't ask why I know but i'm certain he will have a great career ahead of him. Also Michael Kelly as the abusive dad was great. Alex Russel was good too and Michael B. Jorden played role really well as well. But more importantly director Josh Trank debut, which is a great achievement! Bravo Trunk! Bravo. I'll keeping an eye out for his upcoming movies. Of course there are some bad points. The lack of explanation on how they got their powers. And the bad CGI most notably. This movie is extremely recommended!",Chronicle
356,AileenTan12,This movie is not highly recommended.,3,12 February 2012,"To start off, I commend the casting directors for casting such great talents. The actors did a terrific job in expressing the emotions of their respective characters. However, that's the only thing that I liked about this movie.First of all, the camera is so shaky. I understand that it's because the movie was 'taped' by a teenager who records everything that transpired in his life, but the shakiness makes me dizzy.In addition to that, the plot is nothing special. There are so many questions left unanswered. Like, how did the crystal get to Earth. Is it even a crystal? What's with the sound at the pit where the crystal was found? How did it vanish? How did the characters know of their powers and how to use them? I feel like there's a deep lesson that the writers wanted to show but wasn't able to.Furthermore, the special effects are horrible. It's so obvious that the actors were hanging by a rope. The angles of their bodies give it all away. You can definitely determine where the ropes are attached.In my opinion, the plot is pointless. It's predictable and boring. Half way through the movie, nothing near a climax is happening yet. The ending is okay, I guess. It contains a few symbolism and, what I think is, the theme of the whole movie.",Chronicle

I also felt disappointed as I'm afraid the trailer does reveal some of the end scenes, so if you want to sea the film, don't watch the trailer.The film was filmed with a home camcorder, which I have to admit I had to get used to, however after a while it was fine. The film also did seem to drag on a bit, however it wasn't too bad.I thought that overall the film had lots of heart, and was a big improvement on these blockbusters which lack decent acting.",Chronicle
358,Kobestarr,With amazing powers comes amazing responsibility!,9,24 February 2012,"I cannot impress enough on people how entertaining a film Chronicle is! In the last 20 minutes of the film I was literally on the edge of my seat deeply involved in the action. I can't remember the last time that a film drew me in to that extent with me willing the story on.Chronicle centres around Andrew, a high school loner whose only real contact outside of his own world is via his cousin and a new camcorder. His cousin Matt persuades him to go to a rave, which he reluctantly agrees to but behind the safety of his camera. Whilst at the party Matt and a friend, Steve find a hole in the ground and the all head down there to investigate.The three guys emerge from the hole with partial amnesia and new unexplained powers. The film focuses on the three characters as the learn, train and play with their new found skills, benefiting the troubled Andrew as he comes out of himself and finds friendship for the first time since he was a young boy.It is this relationship that is the main draw of the film as the boys train their powers. They learn that they cannot escape their personal lives and try not to let emotions guide them in true ""with great power comes great responsibility"" style.Chronicle takes a step up in gear that drives forward as through to the climax in a way that is enthralling entertaining and exciting.At times the ""found footage"" aspect aspect was contrived and the CGI unconvincing but not at the expense of great cast, performances, direction and story.Coming in at modest $12m this a huge slap in the face of the ultra high budget films that still dish out style over content. This will end up as one of the best films of 2012 no doubt! K*",Chronicle

The story line in general was good, however, there where many scenes where I would have liked to have seen a different outcome. My first criticism with regards to this movie is the lack of much expected action adding to the fact that all the action was crammed into a short space of time. The second criticism would be the ending. There are many unanswered questions.

Although the acting in this film may not be an Oscar worthing, the characters do pull off a good job as their own characters. After seeing this film back in February, I had already heard of Josh Trank be interested in directing the ""Fantasic Four"" reboot. If he weren't interested in directing the reboot, I would have hoped at the time he would also be interested in making a sequel to this film, without doing found-footage type of filming.

It is even the most thrilling found footage film than Paranormal Activity or The Blair Witch Project. The script is good. But the best is the fun never stops as thrills begin to rise while the movie runs. Now, lets talk about the effects. The effects are likely real. You can hear vibrate sounds, wind, crashing and booming, and some shattering. You can see also building getting crashed, cars crashing, crushing and flying, lightning strike, and many more. Then, lets talk about the story. The story is about a teenager named Andrew videotaping his life. One night after partying (he left), Andrew, his cousin, Matt, and the most popular student, Steve discover a hole, which they find a giant crystal.

362,jfcdownsi,Cloverfield meets Akira?,8,19 March 2013,"This is, by far, the best POV film since Cloverfield - fact! Although drawing obvious comparisons to Cloverfield with its personal camcorder style film, Chronicle takes any sort of conventional camera view point, whether it be CCTV, helicopter cameras or a blog camera, filled by one of the main characters love interest - a simple plot line designed to improve the narrative of the storyline. However any changes to the storyline and similarities to Cloverfield, Blair Witch, Paranormal Activity etc stop there. What this film is - is more of a teen angst drama, similar to 'I am number four' in many respects, although a better made and written story. What this film does so well is create a realistic downfall of the main character, combined with superhuman powers forced upon him, his cousin, and the popular kid in school. What happens after that, is anyones guess. I can't reveal too much, but if you enjoyed the filming of Cloverfields' action scenes, or Paranormal Activity's realism, you will probably enjoy this too. Not your typical superhero film but with the style of filming aside, plotwise, this has many similarities with the extremely classic Akira - and if you watch this film and enjoy it, I seriously recommend Akira a watch - albeit an anime, Chronicle has clearly been influenced a lot by this classic. If Akira was ever to be made live action and if they ever made it of a similar quality as Chronicle, then it wouldn't be a half bad attempt. Although the acting is often understated, the superhuman powers have absolutely no explanation - all that does is envelop the viewer with the sense of limitless possibilities in terms of the final outcome. Although the plot line is often predictable, the actual varied scenes keep the story moving at a very decent pace, almost perfectly filling its hour and a half length, any less would be too short, and any longer would definitely be long winded. Not a film for a sequel I fear, only because a sequel would be difficult to make as good.",Chronicle

I think it's definitely fine to follow your dreams and to challenge yourself, but not when the method you use is against morals. I don't agree their way of using the power but it was a good lesson.

Learning and using new powers despite adolescence and bullying! Great character growth operated by all characters, especially Michael B. Jordan's ""becoming big"" performance.Also, if you notice at the beginning of the movie, the handheld usage of the video by the main character is choppy and ""unprofessional"". But as the characters learn how to control and perfect their powers, the image becomes less choppy and smooth. The correlation between power control and smooth beautiful picture is striking. Slightly film noir-ish.

If I had to compare it to anything, it'd be Shyamalan's superhero origin movie Unbreakable. In as far as it tells a story of power, responsibility, and the ties between heroes and 'villains' without the gloss and explosions of the typical blockbuster superhero fare.That said, the shooting style shifts in Chronicle. Away from such a strict 1st person telling to something more 3rd person. But it still maintains it's very personal hand-held quality. It just becomes more 'man on the street' footage vs. lead footage. And the story isn't so black and white in regard to heroes and villains. There's empathy and growth, apathy and undoing on both sides.All in all, it didn't fit any one genre perfectly, a good sign in my eyes. It was superhuman but only to serve human story, it was equal parts heart wrenchingly dramatic and laugh out loud funny. It wasn't perfect. There were moments of student film-ness that could've been better. But overall the story was there made up for any failings. Like listening to an old cassette demo of a great band.",Chronicle

Straight up Chronicle delivers with humor, engaging story & visual cinematography, intensity and an unpredictable ending that differs from other shaky camera thrillers. For once the camera doesn't end on the floor!One thing that I noticed and found that worked with Chronicle, was that it not only used one camera but switched between the cameras of many different characters and places such as iPhones, security cameras etc... The only criticism I had for this film was that the ending dragged out a bit and kinda felt like a superman battle which was a bit ridiculous at times, yet didn't spoil the film for me.In retrospect I left the film knowing I had gotten more than I had expected and although it leaves it open for a sequel, I doubt and hope there will not be, as I believe the story is done and told.Other than a drawn out ending Chronicle exceeded expectations and is a great start for 2012, as well as leaving the door open for more ideas in this genre.Rating: 7/10",Chronicle
372,mli-618-454454,Extremely boring hollow movie,1,29 April 2012,Wasn't expecting much but was dragged by high IMDb review score... was so wrong here- film is so boring that I started to fast forward in the middle of it (for 3 minutes as my girlfriend told me to stop as she watched most of it and it's not much of torment left). Film is done in a Blair Witch Project way- main characters are filming everything and it's the same way of personal camera story tell way. As all we know it tells the story of American teenagers and such teenagers are the only positive audience this film can have. Actually I am really surprised it can have any positive audience as I really tried hard to understand what could be graded so high... Film doesn't show anything- action just goes flat forward relentless- guys are talking about everything but nothing they say is really interesting. It tries to show feelings guys share between each other- their relationship and emotion-play. The thing is that story is sooo poorly made and scenario is sooo weak that all the behaviour of the guys (specially Andrew with his psycho problems) is tiresome and is annoying for the spectator. The only positive thing is special effects- they are nice but you could good as well watch them separately- you would save a lot of time... So I will- as this movie- tell no more- there is nothing more to say...,Chronicle
373,judder_vision,Everything was just sort of here-and-there,4,13 February 2012,"After seeing the trailer, I was so excited to see this movie. It wasn't long 'til I was sitting in the theatre wondering when it would end. It constantly left me hoping something exciting would happen. It seemed as though it just dragged along, not following any sort of storyline at all.It starts out with these three boys who happen upon a hole leading to a rock that gives them telekinetic powers. And we never hear about the rock again. This incredible, mysterious, glowing rock that allows for the rest of movie to actually play out wasn't important enough to be mentioned of again.There was no lead-up from scene to scene and there was nothing that tied the scenes together; suddenly they're flying, then they're in a car, then a talent show, then a party, a car again, flying again, then Andrew decides to rob a gas station. Everything was just sort of here-and-there. And Andrew at the end was WAY too over-the-top. The only parts I actually found the least bit entertaining was when the boys used their powers to mess with people at the store and when Andrew used his powers when he was angry (save for the ending). I honestly think the only thing I appreciated was the concept and the special effects.",Chronicle
374,parsaeshragh,my idea about this movie,9,12 August 2012,"at first i must say a sorry to the readers because its my first review. i think this movie was some how strange and this movie could be better than this.much better.but i didn't get why the director put the fighting scene at the end?? i loved the first 50 minutes of this film.you know it was really good and powerful.flying parts.bothering parts,the jokes and ..... but about the last 35 minutes ... you know it was sort of disappointing.you know ... that part of fighting and madness ... that part was odd and i didn't get why the director put the fighting and madness scene at the end?? in my opinion if the movie was ended after first 50 minutes it would become a good movie.but as i told the last 35 minutes destroyed all of the movie!! this movie could be better than this.much better.at last i didn't get why the director put the fighting scene at the end??i mean really why?? and as you see i rate this movie 8 out of ten and eight means a completely normal movie to me.about this movie i can say somehow wanted to tell us the real strength of power.it doesn't matter witch power but all of them in their own whey will double or make more something that's in the owner of that power.you know..make good better and make bad worst. as you see in this movie Andrew wasn't a normal person.he had some complex and anger in himself.so the power made him worst and involved him to that creature ... but Steve and Matt ... they were good you know...they didn't have any thing bad in themselves so they didn't become worst they grew better.i hope you find this review useful. and as i told sorry about the mistakes because it was my first review. thank you for your attention",Chronicle
375,ryanapearce,Tons Of Fun From Beginning To End,9,4 February 2012,"Every so often you get a film in theaters from a director you have never heard of and lead actors you have never seen. Your first thought is to pass the film because there is no way a movie could be good unless there were some A-list actors and a director who has had years of experience. Chronicle is one of those movies you rarely find in theaters now-a-days, with great acting, fantastic storyline/concept, and some great camera angles thanks to the director.Chronicle is a unique take on a ""superhuman"" kind of film and mixes it with the ""found footage"" filming style. Both of these concepts together create something viewers haven't really experienced before. Some might be cautious about seeing this movie because of an unstable camera; this was not the case with Chronicle. I found the shots to be surprisingly smooth for a ""found footage"" film, and it really helped me connect with the characters, as if I were a fourth member of the film.The story takes place with Andrew, a kid in high school with troubles both at home and in school. His cousin, Matt, tries to be more friendly with him in hopes of making Andrew feel more accepted. After being forced to a party, the two run into Steve, the popular guy of the school and stumble across a huge hole in the ground. Filled with curiosity, the 3 guys go down to investigate. Waking up the next morning the 3 realize that they have telekinesis powers. From then on out, they pull small pranks, until one of the friends abuses their powers and starts to cause trouble.The pacing was slow at first but it was necessary to introduce the characters; however, about half way into the movie the pace quickens and from then on out you are taken on a wild roller coaster ride. Being a low-budget film, some CGI came across as a bit amateur but in no way did it ruin the film.Overall I was very impressed with this film and thought it was definitely worth the money.",Chronicle

377,sugar_lump2008,A few funny moments but terrible overall,3,22 February 2012,"This is one of them terrible films I wished I had never paid to see. To summarise... The good points: - There are a few funny moments - The shaky camera work is not as annoying as other POV camera films such as Blair witch or Cloverfield - The film started off with a lot of potentialThe bad points: - As the film went on, the worse it got - The characters were incredibly clichéd, eg. the bullied loner, the popular guy and the laid back waster. Oh and lets not forget the one that ALWAYS gets angry and power mad - There was no explanation to a lot of things, eg. the strange discovery the boys encountered and the nosebleeds. Although I think this was done purposely - The very very very poor endingSo no I did not enjoy this film, it was very poor and I do not understand why some people are giving it 10/10. I know everyone has different opinions but after reading some of the good reviews I'm starting to wonder if we all seen the same film!",Chronicle
378,Maverick2014,"A great movie about the coolest ""superpower""",10,15 March 2012,"I will tell you upfront that I am biased about this movie. Ever since I remember, I have thought that telekinesis is the greatest superpower ever! So, naturally, when i saw the trailer for this movie i almost shat my pants! After three months of waiting Chronicle has arrived in the Netherlands and i just saw it in its first day. And i was not disappointed!The special effects are great, which i assume is why most people will go see the movie. The acting never lets you down and the director makes you feel that you are in the middle of the action, right next to the protagonists, especially in the flying scenes. Like someone here said, the three characters use their powers to do the things that the regular Joe would try and do. This helps making a connection with the audience.Bonus: the nice surprises! 1) I usually hate this ""reality TV"" style of filming but here they made use of the camera in an ingenious way: the main camera is most of the times flying by (yes, telekinesis) and some of the footage contains recording from other peoples' phones, video cameras or traffic cameras. These two combined build the ""chronicle"" narration and make it the closest thing to the classic, third-person omniscient narrative. 2) Someone here had commented that the ending was not as good as the rest of the movie. So i prepared myself for that because the end is what breaks or makes a movie. i was so relieved to witness that the ending did not disappoint and it seemed like the natural way to end this story while still leaving room for sequels without feeling stretched out.Speaking of sequels, go see this movie! Even if box office will not convince 20th Century fox to make Chronicle 2, this is a great stand alone movie! But, in the rare chance they will make it, there are so many angles that they can approach the story! It's up to YOU to make it happen by convincing your friends to go see it.Oh, and to all of telekinesis fans out there... This will be a sweet ride!",Chronicle
379,Colyn1006,"""Found footage"" films have the tendency of being awful, predictable, and nothing but a cheap money grab; Chronicle, thankfully, is different.",8,5 February 2012,"Chronicle is a ""found footage"" film that is similar to Cloverfield, The Blair Witch Project, and - the infamous - Paranormal Activity series. Those kinds of films (mainly Paranormal Activity) have a tendency of being awful, predictable, and nothing but a cheap money grab; Chronicle ,thankfully, is different.Andrew (Dane DeHaan) is a high-school teenager who has decided to make videos of his life. Through these videos, we find out Andrew is a total outcast and doesn't have an easy life. Andrew's father is an abusive drunk, his mother is dieing of cancer, and his cousin, Matt (Alex Russell), barely tolerates him. One day, While Matt is driving Andrew back from school, Matt urges Andrew to go to a party with him. Matt then pleas Andrew not to bring his camera; Andrew doesn't listen. After being punched in the face by a drunk raver, ""the footage"" then cuts to Andrew sitting outside the party crying. Steve (Michael B. Jordan) walks up to Andrew and tells him that he and Matt have found something they want him to film. What they find is a huge hole. As Andrew is filming the hole, an odd sound is being produced from the inside. Steve, Matt, and Andrew both climb into down hole to see what is. What they find is ______________________________. Some time later, Andrew, Matt, and Steve are then shown that they've developed telekinetic powers (that's when the fun begins). Instead of using their powers to fight crime, the three - now friends - use their powers to play practical jokes on people. As their powers get better, so do the camera angles. Andrew is eventually able to levitate the camera anywhere imaginable as he's doing anything. It's pretty cool.What amazes me about Chronicle is how well everything has been written. The writing is very well thought out and so are the three main characters. It's rare that you see this in any film. It's even rarer when you see this in a ""found footage"" film. I'd advise any writer that plans on writing anything about high-school teenagers to watch this film; These are how real high- schoolers act. They're not too immature, they're not too mature. They're teenagers. simple. That's one of the reasons why I love these characters, I can relate to them. Regardless of who you are, you can relate to at least one of the three main characters. As for the other two, you probably know/knew someone who had similar personality traits. It doesn't hurt either when the three form a strong friendship with one another. The first hour or so is a great bromance filmThe effects are pretty good, for the most part, considering Chronicle is a low-budget thriller. Most of the effects are practical with uses of some green screen technology. The stunt that looked a little odd to me was the flying, but you get used to it after a while and accept it for what it is. Even though some of the effects looked a little awkward, I have no choice but to respect it, for the fact Chronicle didn't rely solely on CGI.Dane DeHaan, Alex Russell, Michael B. Jordan give great, convincing performances. These characters feel real, so you have to give credit to the three main actors for making them come to life.In case you can't already tell, I really enjoyed Chronicle, and I think anyone that likes superhero movies will too. Chronicle is the definition of a great ""found footage"" film. Chronicle is a fun, thrilling movie with simple, yet great dialogue that comes with a great story. Chronicle does a brilliant job at making you feel like you're part of the movie (I really felt like I was the fourth member of the crew), and that means something. I give Chronicle a very enthusiastic 4 out of 5.",Chronicle

To be honest I do feel the same about this filmThe idea is sound and in general well executed, the acting is smooth and the film watches well.

It is certainly well worth a watch, the characters are well rounded and pretty realistic, the effects are good and the storyline is well thought out (for the most part).

383,exo-planett,http://tgtbtw.blogspot.com/,7,26 February 2012,"Chronicle is a found footage film that follows the story of three friends, Andrew, Matt, and Steve, and how they gain their supernatural powers. While they are at one of their friends party they discover a deep hole that has a high pitched sounds screeching out of it. When they go to check out where the sounds is coming from they reach the end of the hole and find a strange blue-glowing structure. As the high pitched sound starts to become unbearable, Steve's nose begins to bleed badly, and right than Andrew's camera cuts out. When the camera is turned back on we are witness to the three friends trying to learn their new abilities.What made the story so unique compared to most supernatural thrillers, is that the whole understanding of the power is completely left up to us. In all super hero stories we always know where the power of the villain and the hero came from, therefore we already know the motive behind both of the there goals, making the story more predictable. In the case of Andrew, Matt, and Steve, they stumble upon the structure and with no other knowledge, gain this power. We as an audience get to see these three individuals minds expand, as they gain godlike powers. Their minds could take them anywhere, and as their power grows stronger, that same power begins to corrupt, and take over their body.Chronicle adds some fresh new elements to the somewhat dry style of ""found-footage"" filming. At points when the character Andrew (who did most of the filming) did not have the camera, we as an audience got to see the scenes through a different camera instead. Even some cameras with no sound such as, hospital cameras in hallways, or police dashboard cameras. It was new, and realistic approach to a genre which at times feels duplicated. It has also since improved the quality of how distorted some scenes with lots of action can turn out, which a lot people complained about when watching Cloverfield(2008).I'm extremely excited to see what comes next from Writer, Max Landis, and Director Josh Trank. For this to be a first full length film for both of them, makes this film even more impressive. They both to seem to have a passion for science fiction, which is a genre that is need of some serious help. I'm curious to see if they continue on with the story of Chronicle, or if either of them have new stories to tell.",Chronicle

First of all, it is entirely viewed through cameras carried by characters, with some exceptions which were refreshing. So if you don't like the shaky shots, perhaps this movie is not for you. The special effects are mostly excellent, outstanding at the movie climax. There is maybe some kind of deepness of characters, but just enough to explain the main character's behavior.

Three teenage boys, Andrew Matt and Steve, are suddenly empowered with telekinesis and begin to grow stronger as well as change personally with every use. The underlying theme is what would one do if one is so possessed. Each boy develops reasons and rules for using their new found power. There is one sub-theme, however, that bears mentioning. Andrew is bullied, both by his peers and his father. He is Matt's cousin, and at one point asks Matt the question: ""Do you like me?"" Matt is unable to satisfactorily verify that he does like Andrew. Later on we find out that Matt does like, even loves his cousin, but Andrew never finds out. It leaves you with the thought that had Matt expressed his feelings more succinctly for his bullied cousin, the climax may have unfolded differently. The sight of Andrew reaching out for love and recognition made my heart melt, and illustrated to me that we all should watch for the signs of bullyism, and do what we can to express love and validation to bullied kids before it is too late. The climax is somewhat spectacular yet disturbing: a special effects extravaganza on the one hand (even though it is filmed through hand held cameras) no pun intended, and a sad commentary on the other. The three young actors are up to the challenges of their roles, and even look somewhat natural during the flying scenes, which is a testament to the trainers who taught the boys how to use the rigging. The ending is less than satisfying, unless there is going to be a sequel. Without a sequel, the ending is somewhat cold, figuratively and literally.",Chronicle

The first time Steve touches the rock his nose starts bleeding which plays sort of a key part in this movie.That is the main idea of the movie but there is more than just three teens with super-powers. First of all, the main character, Andrew, who ends up going berserk with his powers, has an abusive father and a ill mother. Matt is Andrew's cousin and Steve is just a friend of Matt who ends up becoming friends with Andrew only because he too got super-powers.This movie could NOT have been any better. The actors were terrific and the plot was excellent.(My opinion about what the sequel should be about) - The sequel, if there is one should be called, 'The A-Pex Experiment', where the government plants the rock there in order for them to obtain the powers and see if the power gets to them, as it did to Andrew in 'Chronicle'. That's pretty much it lol.",Chronicle
400,andrew7777,A Great Twist on the Superhero Story,9,9 June 2012,"Chronicle: 8.9/10 Advertised as just another ""lost footage"" flick, Chronicle proves to be anything but. With a surprisingly deep story of three teens who are granted telekinesis powers, one starts to lose control with his dying mother, abusive father, and harsh school life beginning to break him down to his last nerve. The director created interesting ways of filming the footage (such as moving the cameras with their powers, using the ""bystanders'"" footage, and even footage from security cameras in buildings) putting a whole new twist on the growing genre. The story itself is also great, as the boys harness their powers after coming into contact with an alien-like object buried beneath the earth. The biggest aspect of this film is that it feels real, unlike ""Paranormal Activity"" and ""Apollo 18,"" which can seem just silly at parts. But ""Chronicle's"" cast of characters show superb acting skills and I found myself feeling for every one of them. Altogether, these elements craft a tremendous movie that seems to take a giant step in the right direction for the genre.",Chronicle
401,ilivethis14,"Not what is depicted by the trailer, but still a tremendous ride",9,4 February 2012,"By far one of, if not the best, found footage film of all time and the biggest surprise of the last few years in my opinion. To start out, for a low budget film the special effects are spot on (definitely Oscar worthy come next season), never seeming cheesy, over the top, or unnecessary. Along with the special effects, the writing and acting were in a word, great. We as the audience genuinely feel for the hardships of the characters, one more so than the other two, however, in the end, each of their ultimate outcomes do create a true emotional impact that stays with you once credits roll. This is where Chronicle separates itself from the found footage genre, as well as many other mainstream cinema. In films such as The Blair Witch Project, Cloverfield, and Paranormal Activity, we don't care about the characters themselves, other than the fact that they are merely there to push the story along and the found footage style is only used to instill an eerie feel to the atmosphere of the film, which can get quite irritating after a while. Chronicle on the other had uses it to create a more personal connection to the characters, which ultimately creates a much stronger film, and the camera work gets substantially better once it is no longer being physically carried. Overall, the only reason this does not get a 10 would be that it was a bit cliché in terms of the use of high school stereotypes and the story as a whole was a tad predictable in terms of what is going to happen next, but this can be easily over looked when you consider the entire film, and the ride that it takes you on. It looks great, the acting is great, the ending leaves nothing really to be desired, and at a crisp 83 minutes, you can't find a better way to spend $10. - (9.5/10)",Chronicle

The fact that this movie got a 7.5 on here is surprising.Personally, after about the first 10 minutes of the movie, I was tired of hearing the ""s-word"" but that's just me. The movie was really slow and I found myself bored through most of the movie.I felt that the plot was not quite developed. However, I was routing for it until the very end. I wanted the main character,Alex to overcome his obstacles so badly. Instead he was overtaken by his newly found power. It was hard to watch the main character slowly be destroyed and destroy the people who really did love him. If he had killed his dad and been done with it, good for him! But when he killed Steven I was just like ""Why?"" Chronicle had potential but did not reach it. This is coming from someone who had absolutely no expectations.",Chronicle

That's the most interesting part portrayed in this story, ironically said. I love to see how the character of Matt Garetty well played by actor Alex Russell which done a lot to reach and connect with his miserable cousin, Andrew Detmer, who is a boy hated by his own father. In addition to his demoralized surroundings, Andrew had to face his mother illness which seemed hopeless ... yet his mother's concern of Andrew's life apparently shows that there's actually still some love in the air, even it maybe not enough to hold what's coming up next for her son's destiny. The effect caused by the some sort of eccentric crystal activity apparently brought a new phase in Andrew's life and tremendously bonded relations between buddies of three, which still inadequate for Andrew in fitting himself. Acceptance was overrated and somehow it had turned him to someone he's not. Dane DeHaan must gave he's all to play this pathetic loser with a vengeance role.

404,dylanhook,I was expecting to come home to a ton of negative reviews...,1,13 February 2012,"I honestly don't understand how this movie can have so many good reviews. I've never reviewed a movie before, but I absolutely need to write about this. The shakiness of the camera was almost unbearable; I had a raging headache after the first 10 minutes. I understand this is a ""handheld camera"" style movie, but so is Cloverfield, and I didn't have a problem with that at all. The movie looks like crap too, up until the end. This was obviously done on purpose, trying to create the ""home-movie"" type feel that I personally hate in films. The visuals did improve during the last 15 minutes which was when all of the action took place, but the shaky camera and weird cut scenes kinda ruined that for me.The movie has no plot...at all. We kinda just have a few events thrown at us, and we aren't given any explanation as to why or how these things occurred. Basically, the three kids walk down a hole, find a glowing rock, and suddenly have telekinetic powers. No explanation, no other reference to the rock aside from the time they go back to see the hole has sunk in. They then learn to harness their power, and for one of the kids, he becomes mad with power. That's about it. The ending is somewhat confusing, and seems to be left open for a sequel. I also don't get the reason why the kid carries around a camera the whole time. This wouldn't be so bad if the who carrying a camera thing wasn't so over-emphasized throughout the beginning. Everybody he came in contact with in the first 10 minutes of the film referenced the fact that he was carrying a camera and asked him why, and he kept saying ""don't worry about it, just gotta film things now, trust me on this, etc."" no real explanation as to why later in the film. The only redeeming qualities in this film is the semi-cool action sequence at the end and character Steve who was pretty funny. I'd say skip this one, especially if you're prone to getting headaches, or hate movies with minimal plot depth, character development and/or storyline.",Chronicle
405,nick-nelsonmovies,Found Footage Super Heroes,9,3 February 2012,"Chronicle is a movie that I had mixed feelings going into. The trailer showed it had a very interesting premise, but it could have been great or awful luckily it was the first. The movie is about these three friends who find a mysterious sort of rock that gives them super human powers, and it details what happen as their powers get stronger. The film is a found footage film, which first appear on the big screen with the indie hit the Blair Witch Project and other films like the Paranormal Activity franchise and Clover Field. Chronicle is a lot more like Clover Field with how they handle the camera, The camera is addressed right at the beginning of the film. The main character Andrew brings his camera around to document everything that he goes thru, and he gets picked on because of it. They also use the camera in interesting ways, like they use their powers to levitate the camera everywhere they go. I thought that this movie had a great and funny script. They would banter with each other and there was times that I laughed out loud and I don't do that very often. They also made this a very heartfelt story in the short run time of 83 minutes. The camera style really helped out the movie by making it feel so real and that it seems like it could really happen. the last act of this film was frantic and will leave you breathless. I had some minor quips with this film like the shaky cam that comes with the found footage genre, and the flying effect was not the greatest. I was surprised how much I liked Chronicle, you should definitely go see this movie in the theaters. It is a great superhero origin story, and is a lot better than most movies that come out this time of year.",Chronicle
406,Dan-willock,Not What You Expect... Even Better,8,20 February 2012,"I watched Chronicle at the cinema in screen 1 last night. I was not expecting much from it if i'm honest, the adverts and summery made it seem... boring and cliché. DO NOT take any notice of the adverts, they totally throw you off the idea. The film is brilliant, it starts off interesting and ends even better. This film I would say is for the younger though, some people may dislike and not be able to relate to it. Then again we have all imagined what it would be like if we had powers so great you could do what you liked, from lifting things with your mind, to flying through the sky. Well this film basically relates to anyone who has imagined that. It is what really would happen if teens had powers, starting off as a bit of fun and ending up a bit tragic. One of the best things they did is the filming POV, they new that some people dislike the idea of always having a hand-held camera like blair witch, troll hunter and cloverfield, so they made the kid with the camera use his telekinetic powers to hold it like they are being filmed, i thought that was a brilliant way to beat other POV films. The main concept of this film is the quote 'with great powers, comes great responsibility.'. Which is shown very effective in this film. The only criticism is the fact that you never find out where or what the powers have come from except a big flashy stone underground. Hats off to the actors who where unknown and brilliant.",Chronicle
407,irem_genc92,there is no power without control,5,13 May 2012,"Movies's filming technique was more different than the other film and filming was thought you are in movie if you watch Cloverfield or Rec, you can realize resemblance and additionally there was no sound in film.They try to make a realistic movies but because of being science fiction movies there is no realty in story. Still science fiction lover will like it. But besides science fiction sides of movie there is a life story in it. It is telling us main characters problems and what can be happen if a person who has a psychological problems gain supernatural powers .And also Chronicle was a closed movie that there was some questions in my mind. For example what happen to the hole? or why someone else discover it? or why the characters didn't go there again as secondly? They are easily surrender.In movie ordinary people is gaining supernatural powers and you don't know where it came from it was a classic Hollywood movie.Flying scenes were nonsense.There is no thing to say about actors they were fit in their characters.End of the movie was different you don't think like this end.But movie is so smooth that you aren't realize how the time is passing.",Chronicle

Many probably would assume that this movie has zippo brain and intelligence, but surprisingly, that's not that case here. Chronicle is extremely entertaining. It scratches surfaces of character development that you wouldn't expect from a found-footage format film, which I could really appreciate. From the moment the film started I was never bored, nor disappointed with what I was seeing. From flying football to epic beat downs in Seattle's skyline, the film keeps your attention. The characters are all very well developed and well acted by their respective handles. Being a superhero movie, it's not like this film will change your life, but it covers more ground than you may originally think before going into the theatre. The writing and directing are solid as well. Landis and Trank are gonna be a duo to look out for in the future! 8.5/10",Chronicle

What I liked about the movie that it suggests topics that could happen in real life for example: it discussed bullying at school and families argues, we see Andrew fights and tried to do every thing possible to help and save his mother with his super power. And if I were them i would probably use this super power for the same purposes that they used ! The movie is realistic and you feel like It could possibly happen, well it won't happen, but that what you'll feel when you watch the movie !I like the direction and the unique story as well the acting is really convincing and Excellent, but I didn't understand one thing: how they got their super power?! Most likely I wasn't focus at the beginning of the movie! Unless if they got it when they fell down to the underground hole! To be honest I didn't like the movie at the first 10 minutes but, i gave it a chance and i continued watching, and I'm satisfied and glad because I did, that why I rated it 8 out of 10! A mixture between Sci-fi , drama and thrill, made a great flick as well the ending was brilliant and extremely sad, I won't add much more so you guys can enjoy the movie.

410,shanahg,It is a good movie to watch,8,3 February 2012,"The plot was okay, typical guys got superpower type. However, it wasn't like them saving the world, a bit different and more human-natural. I would recommend you to watch it. And then you judge what is the real ""right"". Part of the movie was going so fast and confusing, however the main line of the story is still clear. Also the ending is not bad, not as bad as The devil inside, it was okay, but somehow too simple. So if I say about this movie, I would say it is what normal people would do when they get superpower, beat up the guy you hate, fly or else. Also when you get mad, you will definitely abuse that power, who won't? yeah that I was talking about, this is the greatest point from movie. When you got power, you wouldn't go saving the world, punishing the criminals. ""I don't give a damn"", ""I will just use it however I want, because I'm stronger than everyone...""",Chronicle
411,ollieboon1,Same old thing...,6,14 February 2012,Chronicle has has a fair amount of hype. Using the found footage technique may seem slightly overdone but this film takes the filming style into its own with Andrew being able to manipulate the camera with his powers (A great new spin on found footage).However the plot feels as if it has been done before (the idea anyway) and therefore the story seems so familiar. Not being able to relate Chronicle to any specific films it is easy to pick up on a few things which make you feel as if you have seen the movie before.Nevertheless I think that its worth a watch and will most likely have you enjoying the sometimes more serious and sometimes humorous plot.,Chronicle
412,bigmouthmike,could have been much better with concept of the story,1,14 February 2012,first of all let me start by saying this is 90 minutes of my life i will never get back. following other movies that use point of view or hand held camera style of shooting left me feeling rather sick. the story line was rather weak as they come across something that gives the three guys powers but no explanation of what it is or how it got there or where it went. then it moves too the three guys playing practical jokes and pranks on people where as would have been better if they had become superheros and done some good.the only good part of this movie for me was the end credits seriously as soon as they come up i felt relieved that my 90 minute torture had come to an end if u want entertaining movie don't go and see if u want to be bored go and see.,Chronicle

The movie starts off pretty neatly and keeps you guessing as to whats gonna happen next for the first 15 minutes or so. Thats all what is good about the movie. It totally loses any sense of direction halfway through and leaves you scratching your head. And the misery just piles on from there and I was just waiting for the ending. From an optimistic point of view, some scenes were hilarious. Those were picturized pretty neatly. The acting was pretty mediocre as well. Too many unwanted subplots screw up the main story line and that is what exactly happened. So much more could have been done with this concept but it just wasn't in the right hands! Apart from the pretty good graphics involved, there isn't anything worth watching.",Chronicle
414,ikilraagain,brilliant/funny,8,9 February 2012,"Open film that leave's a lot to the imagination. It show's you how the protagonists act and how they are corrupted in there own way. Yet it is easy to see sequels picking up from the beginning, as this film truly starts from the middle of a story. 3 kids, on a popular Jock, one a genius about the psychological mind and one a social outcast that has never truly been happy, stubble upon an unknown object that changes there lives, some to better, others to the worse. As the story unfolds you see more of how they wish to use there powers, and how they don't. Leading up to one of the shortest yet best fights i have ever seen. The movie itself was well done. Plays out from the camera, and the story twist's depending on who is holding it. The CGI was mind bogglingly good, it truly looks like it is happening real in real life, not some Hollywood trickIt was also explained in a way that these powers seem so possible that anyone could get them, and it also show's the consequences if miss used and everything in the middleAll in all this movie is worth watching for those people that that love a laugh, with the tricks that these kids get up too be that a little perv with a blower, or taking the gum out of someone's mouth.

While we're talking about endings, Chronicle's ending was dis-likable and kind of sad but it fitted just fine in the whole story of Chronicle. Great way of in-movie-camera recording, 'cause it makes the movie look more realistic/less edited, but because of that you might get a feeling that the movie is a low-budget one, but it's not, and don't let that spoil the fun for you.

417,rickhowarth69,Almost great but wouldn't pay twice to watch this,7,20 February 2012,"I left the cinema, which i had attended alone for the first time not quite sure how mush i enjoyed Chronicle. Yes it was good, yes it was original to a point, but it left me with an empty feeling. THe character were far to stereotypical, the jock, the geek and the self proclaimed outsider, does the USA have any other type of people. The three come together somehow and the inevitable happens to all three. The jock bites the dust for no real reason other than to provide further expansion of the story, the geek realises his power over normal people (basically every bad guy, in any films story) and the outsider realises the benefits of not being an outsider.... So where i hoped it would go didn't, it just faded into predictability. I had hoped for the three to continue to explore their powers and use them to provide either comedy delight or a, 'yes i would probably do that feeling', okay they have fun but it becomes all to who is the most powerful to quickly. The geek becomes popular but then turns against his only true friends, as well as become a super annoying character. He may have problems with his father, but surly using his powers to discover a way to heal is dieing mother would have provided more interest. I point you in the direction of Bradley Coopers movie limitless, which is far more rewarding. In this he uses his powers gained by taking a magic pill, to find a way to continue this ability In surprising way and uses it against those trying to better him. Chronicle doesn't do this, it just touches on elements of what would you do. In the main of the film they discover they can fly, what do they do, they play football in the sky and then put on a magic show, boring to say the least once past the initial amusement. In the end the geek decides, amateurishly to say the least, to rob a petrol station dressed as a fireman, mmmm. perhaps use your powers to rob a bank or create a hole in a vault. Eitherway it is his undoing and the end of the film arrives as his bully of a father arrives by his hospital bedside to blame him for the death of his mother, all in the same night..... Commence Geek goes mad, and rampage on the locals begins. Outsider who cared about nothing at the start now cares about everyone and saves the day. Different movie, but in hindsight, not a different as you may think if you take away the nutty camera angles, which i thought would bother me at the start but its well done to no complaints there. For me a 7, just. Could have been great, just a shame the ideas seem to run out early on.",Chronicle

While watching, i felt the tension build until it seemed that small rocks were starting to rise and hover in a foreboding manner around my couch, as they did in the movie. My cynical side would call this movie Akira Light, but even so, i would HIGHLY recommend it.Filler: loved the actors, none of whom i recognized.

You have a kid that is bullied at school, abused by his father, has a dying mom, is socially awkward, and is in high school. He buys a camera and tells his dad, ""I'm recording everything from here on in."" You think his life is going to stay the same, like all teenage movies. But at a party, he, his cousin, and his cousin's friend go into a hole they find in a forest, which contains a supernatural crystal which gives them all nosebleeds. The movie flashes forward when they are discovering their new powers which include telekinesis and flight. But the kid, Andrew, starts to become corrupted with these powers. The second half of the film is about him exploiting these powers and killing people. The climax is intense, poignant, and wonderful.This movie was excellent. It was timed beautifully and made with skill, precision, and knowledge. It was a pleasure to watch, and probably the best found footage movie I have ever seen, taking into consideration Cloverfield and Paranormal Activity. The climax was beautiful and the very end was sad. I couldn't help but cry at the last scene.One thing this movie could do to improve is make it easier to tell who is filming.

423,emile-isopescu,A True Masterpiece,10,28 May 2012,"Unfortunately, I wasn't able to see this film on the big screen, but after viewing the trailers I was quick to pre-order it on DVD. I cut myself out from the world of Chronicle so as to avoid any spoilers or opinions, leaving me going into this film with a fresh mind, a blank canvas. If my mind was the canvas, and this film was the artist, then it has just painted a masterpiece. I have seen tons of films, yet this one seems to have left a massive, lasting impression on me. It's an interesting take on the 'found-footage' sub-genre and it's incredible. We first see these seemingly normal high-school boys, one of which is the classic quiet and disturbed teenager who has a bad family life. The way this film deals with his life is perfect and it's entirely believable. The thing that drew me into this film the most is what they do with their new-found abilities. In reality, if we acquired super-human abilities our first thoughts wouldn't be to help people. We are only human, after all, and thus we would pursue money, fame or popularity. This is especially true for teenage boys who are naturally reckless. The film is soaked in originality and if you're obsessed with super-human films like myself, it will leave your heart racing and your mind so blown it will be splattered all over the floor.The story isn't exactly unique but it somehow manages to tell that familiar super-human story in a new way. The reason that the main character acquires the camera is natural and it's something that you can imagine someone doing in his position. To tie it all together in a wonderfully neat package is the visual effects. The effects are fantastic and it all adds to the realism. The flying effects and fight scenes are all fantastically well done and it's worth seeing just for that! All in all, great film. Whether your into super-human movies or not, go and see it. You will not disappointed.",Chronicle

This definitely breaks the mold of low budget 1st person camera style movies (blaire witch, paranormal activity, cloverfield). The camera motion felt nature and some cool tricks dealing with the characters telekinesis powers helped keep it dynamic. It was also cool that the shots were used from multiple cameras (not just the one the main character has). Story line is good, even though you might expect a typical superhero movie. It's not. The way the characters deal with their powers seems much more realistic and entertaining. The acting is also very natural and character development is smooth. It's really clear how the main guy slowly morphs his ego and gets full of himself. Same skill goes with the other two (Steve playing a friendly, popular, hotshot, with a compassionate supporting side-the good guy. Matt as a more level headed guy who eventually tries to reason with his distancing cousin) CGI is decent most of the way through besides a few scenes in the clouds (gets a bit hairy). Overall, definitely worth the rental fee. Probably a theater ticket too. I find myself really moved by the whole film now (day after) and the whole concept is just interesting.

The style of movie-telling used in Chronicle is actually more unique to our generation, and this is (for me) the first time it's been used as a device to really put the audience ""in the characters head"".When I first saw Chronicle (release day), I could not believe some of the things they chose to do, and the direction they chose to take the story in.This is a story that (assuming you went to college/high school etc) feels like it was written by someone who knows some of the people you actually know, and does some of the things you actually do, or wanted to.When you put these things together - you have a film that is not going to be to everyones liking, but those who are into it, will REALLY be into it.This film is a buzz-kill, but it's a fantastic one.",Chronicle
427,iMusicMacedonia,Oh my god.,9,14 June 2013,"Chronicle tells a story of three boys meeting an unknown source that gives them superhero powers that are very unusual and basically - not seen every day. Of course, with great power comes great responsibility and one of the boys can't handle it and that's when things turn bad. Saying that they and specifically he can't control it things turn very very ugly at a sudden moment. This movie was great. I loved the plot,the acting,the point of view and of course the special effects. The point of view is what amazed me cause we are talking about a found footage movie and not a regular one like 'Paranormal Activity' or 'The Blair With Project'. This movie brings something new to this genre and that's what makes it so awesome. While watching the movie I felt like I'm the 4th superhero. The technique used makes you feel like your one of them. There were many many cool scenes that you have to think awhile to come up with them and this just proves another thing - the director gave everything he had and we loved it.

Yes, it is a good documentary movie in the sense that the cam-holder at least knows what a camera actually is (that's a first).But other than that, the plot was horrible (The ever clichéd story line of the unpopular nerd getting unfathomable super powers and wreaking havoc, or simply, a total rip off of Carrie),the characters did not have any unique personality that you would want to root for, and the story did not follow any specified pattern or focused on one character,but just drifted from one character to the next (like my mood throughout the movie).

435,rajje-1,"Surprisingly well-made, intense and realistic",9,5 May 2012,"I had heard this was a low-budget science-fiction film, so I watched it expecting a simple, rough, dialogue-based flick made by some college kids with a bit of clumsily but proudly inserted CGI. Sure enough, it begins with grainy point-of-view video footage of Andrew Detmer's (Dane DeHaan) home and life as a quite stereotypical outcast kid with an abusive father. Everyone in his surroundings, except for his wannabe-philosopher cousin Matt Garetty (Alex Russell), seem to inexplicably hate him, especially when he films them, and when he's dragged along to a party and brings the camera, he doesn't manage well. Having the camera anyway, Andrew is asked by Matt's friend Steve Montgomery (Michael B. Jordan), an archetypal popular guy, to come and tape something cool they've discovered in the woods outside. The thing radically changes the three kids' lives and also brings them together. Very early, it turns out that the low-quality feel was just sort of a prank by the director. The character gets a new camera, replacing his broken ""piece of sh*t from like 2004"", and suddenly the picture is perfect and in 1080p. Some obviously CGI floating balls and lego pieces are shown and I'm guessing the film was made just to show off some guy's supposed animation skills. But then the complexity and realism rapidly increases with every scene, until it's intense. Also, with every scene, vanishes the stereotypicism of the three characters and they develop into real people. ""Chronicle"" is high-quality but it's not about polished effects. It is very human - it's a journey and an interesting thought experiment. It shows what could happen if an oppressed outcast in the real world suddenly was given power. It metaphorically depicts the mind of the outcast - an insecure and distanced mind, brought up in mental and physical abusiveness. A mind where years of humiliation and powerlessness has built up banks of anger and chronic mistrust, that can't be fixed easily. The writing and acting is ultra-realistic, with as few Hollywood-style deliveries as possible. The cinematography also adds realism by exclusively using diegetic video sources - yet it cleverly jumps between many different such sources. ""Chronicle"" is not simply derivative of ""The Blair Witch Project"" or the obvious comparison ""Cloverfield"", but it brings to mind such European directors as Lars von Trier and Jesper Ganslandt.""Chronicle"" is a most welcome addition to the field of science-fiction and of films in general. It is a clever new take on some concepts and it has a genuine story. It is neither an action sci- fi, nor a quiet ""thinking man's sci-fi"". It brings a lot of heart and the slow build-up and intense realism causes an amount of suspense I never experience in action films.",Chronicle
436,helicon02,Chronicle: You are an Idiot,5,11 June 2012,"I really expected to like this movie because my hopes were low. It can be tough for found footage films to 'land' and actually make the viewer believe what is happening. Movies like 'Rec','The Tunnel' + 'Super 8' strike me as movies that found a formula that worked. This movie is very close to getting the formula right, but ultimately falls short on several levels.If you have seen AKIRA, simply remove the label and add 2 cans of cold water to your memories, and you too will have made an unremarkable film like this.The movie is not as terrible as say 'Skyline',""I REPEAT: not nearly as bad as that problem pile"", but it did leave a similar flavor in my mouth. An experiment in how to make a cheap movie look expensive. This movie does achieve interesting things visually, but they are often cut too quickly and don't really give you much to hang on to. The special effects just seem rushed in. I wish movies like this had double the budget to give it the attention and care that it might have deserved.The final conflict was worth sticking around for; at least, if you made it through the first hour. Technically speaking, the special effects and the action during the finale is great, but still feels rushed(&/or limited) being a few minutes too short.That is all I have to say at this time.",Chronicle

The way it was filmed, as if behind a home video bouncing all over, made me a bit sick. I did find it clever, but it got old after a while. It never got any better than what you saw on the trailer. It turned a bit creepy, dark and twisted. It seems like this is the way some movies are going these days. I an starting to think I'm getting too old. I compare this to Cloverfield, if I remember it right. The way it was filmed, how the story played out. It just keeps going. In hope it would get better.

I really do not mind even if there are stupid flaws or big holes in the story, as long as it is still entertaining and that I still get a kick out of it.However for this movie, it simply did not make any sense at all the way anyone would react given the same scenario; that will simply ruin the fun out of it for me.For instance, they can fly, move anything, create barriers, among other things. The first thing any teenagers would do is make some money easily without any problems. For instance, they could bet money of any sports (Basketball, control the ball by preventing it going in the basket, or in football, making the quarterback drop the ball, etc...) especially one of them needed money urgently to buy medication for his mother.Why would anyone want to rob a gas station or take the pocket money from punks when he could simple crush an ATM teller is beyond stupidity?The movie had great potential, but it just went in all directions and with all its flaws it really started to annoy me.Maximum I would give for the movie is 5 stars..

439,normb1-1,A sci-fi that was a pleasant surprise,8,24 November 2012,"This was a movie that surprised me in a good way. The acting was better than normal, the script even more so, but the special effects, for a low budget movie, were spot on. The teens in the movie and for the most part, everyone, acted like real people, doing ordinary things and dealing with challenges, including the pending death of the main character's Mother. What especially appealed to me was that the kids dabbled in their powers, growing more bold each time, and doing stupid, silly things, just like ALL of us would do. The death of the first main character, Steve, was sad as he was the one that brought a sense of fun to having these awesome powers. As the effects of Steve's death and the guilt took its toll, the movie now spiraled into darker territory.As we hit the last third, when Andrew gets desperate for funds and starts his robbery spree, we know he and we are venturing in the Dark Zone and it will end badly. It does, but all the fighting and action sequences are extremely well done and the ending leaves you fulfilled in how it played out.This was a ""small move"" that I barely heard about when it hit the theaters, and happened to find on cable. I recommend it, it's worth the short running time of less that 90 minutes and you'll get a kick from it.",Chronicle

447,RyanT21,Lacking,3,4 February 2012,"I went into this movie with an open mind. I really liked the premise from what I knew about it, and the trailer had me intrigued so I decided to go see it. Coming out of the movie though, I just felt unfulfilled.*SPOILERS*The way they obtained and acted with their powers just rubbed me the wrong way. It was just the fact that they didn't really do anything to much to get these powers, but immediately knew they had them. And I even recall them saying other people had gone in ahead of them, but why had no one else come across this? And why was no one else even around? It just all seemed a little off to me.On top of that, there wasn't much in terms of plot or character development. Andrew (Dane DeHaan) was the stereotypical loner type high school kid, with home problems and the cool relative that tried to get him to socialize. Nothing about him struck me as violent. In fact to me he seemed almost passive, but then he immediately pushes a man off the road and feels zero remorse. From there you could already predict what would happen with him for the rest of the movie. Matt (Alex Russell) was being portrayed as the cool kid who sees that there's more to life than just partying, and is into philosophy and things like that, but I never felt liked he developed as a character. He was just kind of there. He felt the same throughout the whole movie. I felt the same way about Steve (Michael B. Jordan), and when he died I really didn't feel anything, because I felt no connection to him or any of the characters. I wasn't really immersed in this movie, and I walked out unsatisfied.I truly don't understand why this movie is appearing to receive decently high reviews, because honestly it wasn't very good.

The abuse of the vulnerable is not always handled very sympathetically, but in this case the total transformation it causes is seamless and one finds oneself egging them on for vengeance in the first instance and saying 'oh no, don't do that' in the next. There is plenty left unexplained and to think about afterward, which is often the downfall of some stories.

Are they hoping a part 2 will offer some twist like the bratty runt is brought back to life and breaks free after repeated experimentations on him? Is Steve just in a super-power coma and raises from the dead as a returning superhero? How can this storyline stay afloat? Other things I didn't quite fully understand:When you see the fork get bent up from the experimental stabbing, it seems odd that other characters can fall from lightening, fire, bullets, and statue piercing. The handycam style gets tedious. Perhaps I don't understand this 'genre' if that's what people are now calling it. OK, so is this a found-footage film, pieced together puzzle cam, or simply a style of bumpy ride that makes you feel you're experiencing life behind any camera? The film jumps around from lost huge cam, mini handycam, blogger cam, security cam. If the boy comes from meager background, how is it that he lost his cam in the cave, carries a new one afterwards without any notice of financial difficulty, video or audio quality change? It seems even less plausible that righteous cousin would even continue using a cam to 'chrnonicle' this story after the fall of his runt cousin. I hate to think about this more, it simply wastes my time and energy. It's kind of presumptuous they chronicle it 'I' already as I'm truly hoping nobody decides to invest in further development nor the consumer spend their disposable income and valuable spare time on this rubbish. Star Wars IV was a multipart story that at least ended on it's own very well. I'm sorry but this is nowhere near as interesting.",Chronicle

With the recent release of The Devil Inside and Paranormal Activity 3, it seemed that the limits of found footage filmmaking had been exhausted. But then a movie like Chronicle comes along, and proves that in the hands of the right filmmaker, innovation and inspiration can still be found in this shaky, sub-genre. Chronicle is molded around a simple story. Three friends discover a mysterious entity which grants them incredible superpowers. The fun is in watching these guys discover and play with their new found abilities. The effects are often jaw dropping, especially during the flying and telekinesis sequences. Some scenes could use little more polishing, but on a technical level, Chronicle is a great looking film.Props go to Dane DeHaan, for turning in a scary, heartbreaking performance. His character is the heart and soul of the film, which is unfortunately burdened by sub-par acting and dialogue. These weaknesses hold the movie back from ever achieving greatness. Luckily, director Josh Trank utilizes some innovative camera techniques, that push the found footage genre to new limits. If this is where the genre is headed, I'm on board.

It is filed with unknown actors who do a great job, which is great. The effects could have used some work, but they are well above the acceptable level.A lot of people will most likely complain that most of the story is left unresolved/unexplained. That is the point, this movie doesn't draw you a picture, in fact it doesn't even give you the crayons to draw your own. This film documents a story, from where that story starts to where it finishes. Anything that requires an explanation from out side that frame is left out.My only concern is that this film does fall into a hole that most of these ""lost footage"" films do: and that is when we suddenly see footage from an external source.

The amazing superhero and found footage concept makes this film one of the most unique in its genre. The idea of the film all being recorded on a hand-held camera makes the movie the most believable I've ever seen and in an age where one can record there own life wherever is one of the best ideas for a film, much like that of cloverfield etc. But the most amazing thing about this whole movie is how original the story is and how well the characters are played. This isn't a simple good guys verse bad guys, this whole film revolves around these 3 characters who at first use there powers as jokes but learn that they are becoming dangerous. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone who wants to watch a true masterpiece.

I really hope this becomes a major franchise. If you want to see a good movie and have a great time then by all means, go see this film.",Chronicle

Of course I'll take his word on it since he is a budding film maker himself. He enjoyed the special effects and although it is a 'found footage film' he said it utilized that cliché and turned a possible disaster of a film into what he calls a great one. What concerns me is I see Max Landis is screenplay writer. His infamous dad, John Landis, is responsible for the loss of 3 lives while filming The Twilight Zone movie, and has never accepted responsibility and allegedly doodled cartoons and smirked during court proceedings. Spielberg ended his relationship with him and I vowed to never watch a Landis movie again, so all you get is my son's review.

464,Rivero-Daniel,Exactly how it should be,9,5 February 2012,"""By the time Steve, Andrew and Matt become familiar enough with their powers that they are flying at will and moving objects with nothing more than a passing thought, Chronicle already has you hooked.First time director Josh Trank and writer Max Landis put together what feels like the most real life portrayal of what it would be like if teenage kids possessed super powers. As a self-proclaimed nerd when it comes to super hero movies and comics, this is exactly how I'd imagine teenage kids to act if given powers. Whether it's using their powers to have a little fun at other peoples expenses or to further their status at school, it never feels contrived. And when it comes time for one of the trio to turn evil, it comes naturally. How many times is it proved that anger and self-loathing is caused from an abusive and antagonizing head figure at home? It comes as no surprise when Andrew's father complains about having to pay for his public schooling and that it's his fault why his mother is in the condition he is that Andrew would lash out. It actually played out a lot like a modern-day telling of the story of how the X-Men's Magneto became a villain. Not necessarily inherently evil, but because of the events around him. I thoroughly enjoyed this storyline and the path Andrew was on.Of course, the best laid idea is only carried so far if the performances aren't there. The three boys are all played perfectly. The witty banter for the first half of the movie is pitch perfect. The dialogue keeps you loose and right there with the boys as they develop their powers.When the plot takes it's turn towards the dark side, the boys don't lose steam.With a lot of the found footage genre, a shaking camera is inevitable. The use of Andrew's natural talent for telekinesis to hold the camera and provide an answer to this problem was genius. The camera is very still and can provide a look at the one ""holding"" the camera since he has no need to be behind it. At no point did I feel like I would be sick and I generally get motion sickness fairly easy. The use of Matt's girlfriend filming as well for her blog was a great way to have another perspective to the events going on around them. While the special effects aren't Avatar, they are more than serviceable. It was all very fluid and believable.With The Avengers and The Dark Knight Rises due to come out this year, there isn't a shortage of super-hero or super-powers on screen. But with Chronicle, the story of three boys with powers and the consequences of their actions may be the best super-hero movie without a super-hero.""",Chronicle
465,solver2,IT'S about time someone starts thinking outside of the box,10,5 February 2012,"OK, I'm not a critic who has all the correct words to evaluate this flick. However, I will tell you that I'm so grateful that it wasn't all shot like Cloverfield. Thank God they thought outside the box for once. I was getting really tired of the same crappy remakes and sloppy seconds. This was a very fresh movie and I hope that the money powers start a second one that is done just as well as the first, if not better. NO MORE SLOPPY SECONDS. Hell, I wouldn't even mind seeing the last character become one of the Avengers. There are tons of questions that need to be answered and answered well. Normally, I'm left with hating a flick for not having answered some of the questions that the movie asks. However, this time, it was a little different. This is a good recipe and the actors really did a good job. I strongly recommend this movie to everyone and the special affects were really well done. While this movie is Sci Fi, you can kind of see this happening to each of us, if were exposed to the same thing. While it's far fetched, it's still well grounded even in its extremeness. You would think that a studio would be able to see the promise in their own productions and would actually have a part two already in the can and being made ready for a 3 or 4 month release instead of making us wait a year or two. Hell, it could be a new way to create a series for the screen.",Chronicle

467,o-rodwell,The Mark is over there somewhere.,4,7 February 2012,"As you can probably guess from my somewhat sarcastic title, I believe this film is a great idea which just doesn't deliver. The film is clearly a story about superpowers, which is fine its a great device, but the origin of those powers is vague, not investigated and very thin. For a film which is attempting to make it look as real life account as possible, the old 'touched a glowing rock and could fly' thing is a little silly. As for the characters, they are pretty well developed, if not incredibly naive for a bunch of kids that find out they have superpowers, who decide that the coolest thing to do is small pranks and the occasional magic show? And as always there's the misunderstood one who eventually turns bad for the right reasons but the wrong means to the end blah blah blah. Its a little irritating that a boy who needs money for his mother and could easily, fix sports, or levitate money out of a bank or shop, decides attacking and killing people is the only real way, but these films always have little loopholes.one of the nicer aspects of the film is the way that it starts off viewing the main character in a sympathetic light, of course this being the character that eventually ""goes bad"" it should create a strange divide in the audience with those who sympathise with him and those who don't.Of course for the audience I was with, just kind of made us hate the annoying little tit. I know thats a little harsh, and some kids out there are in hard situations and I do feel sorry for them, and I never like people being bullied or abused. But he doesn't seem the 'poor him' type, he seems like the 'you are kind of weird' type, and quite frankly what this film shows is a kid in a touch situation breaking down and killing a load of people. Now Im sorry, but that is a little too close to the people who go into schools in real life with a gun and do this for me to be comfortable with the directors attempts for us to sympathise with him.All in all, Its a very ""late 2000's"" film, with the popular and trendy way of shooting a film as if the protagonists are recording it real time. Although this can work very well, It just does not translate with the underlying themes, and leaves the audience with the feeling of watching something very powerful, and yet I am at odds to discover just what that is beyond a mask of complication over a very simple and disturbing plot.",Chronicle
468,kingderekx,Amazing Story,9,7 February 2012,"This movie is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Maybe it's just because I love found footage films, but I feel they make the movie seem more realistic. We follow the story of Andrew, Matt, and Steve as they gain telekinetic powers and discover just what they are truly capable of. We follow the story of Andrew mostly because he is the one recording everything that happens (with the exception of a couple scenes). Andrew lives a crappy life with a mother who is dying, an alcoholic/abusive father, and is constantly bullied. Of course, when he gains superpowers he realizes he doesn't have to take anyone's crap anymore. The viewer throughout the entire film can't help but feel sorry for Andrew throughout this change.The movie is incredibly realistic not just because it's found footage, but because it also shows exactly what any teenagers would do if they gained telekinesis. Pulling pranks, using it to get popular, and even fly. I also love how the writers incorporated the symbolism of how Greek goods and philosophy are a big part in the story.I give it a 9/10 and not a 10/10 because and ONLY because I thought the part where they go into the cave to find the meteor/crystal/alien thing was written kinda poorly by the writers...I mean, come on...Andrews just sitting there and Steve randomly walks up to him and basically says ""Hey man, come into the woods with me and check out this 'thing' with your camera. Come on, man, trust me."" But I guess not every good movie can be perfect...The movie apparently has been hated by some reviewers because they don't have the cognitive ability to keep up with what is happening without having their hand being held and having every little detail explained.

The movie follows the lives of Andrew (Dane DaHaan), his cousin Matt (Alex Russell), and their friend Steve (Michael B. Jordan) after they obtain telekinesis. It's a found film, so the camera work is a little shaky in the beginning, but the plot more than makes up for that. The acting was also much better than expected, especially considering the fact that these three are relatively unknown. It's pretty easy to feel for the characters, so it's possible to see why they--especially Andrew--do what they do throughout the movie. The special effects weren't the greatest. Some things definitely looked like they were hanging on a string, but others were better. All in all, it was an excellent film.

As seen by the trailers, three high seniors discover an unknown radiation substance that empowers them with abilities that nobody's ever seen or had before, it's almost like a combination of different super powers that's been portrayed in past super hero films.The movie itself is very entertaining and fun and I think most everyone would enjoy it because it covers heroics, resolution, nerve racking, happiness, and most of all a powerful antagonist. Most importantly, it involves every criteria for a movie to be successful but there are still holes in the story much like any other film today but don't let that influence your decision, it's still a good movie worth seeing on a laid back Saturday evening.I give it a 4 our of 5.",Chronicle
472,penpage,"Perfect high school dialogue, and dynamics.",9,10 February 2012,"Like many, I was a teen who attended a public high school. I am proud of the education I received and the fun moments I had being a free spirited young man at a large bustling school. High school can be a difficult experience yet rewarding in that many life lessons are learned while trying to fit in. I saw firsthand the incredible intelligence of my peers and the raw stupidity. I was not immune to their act, I was one of them. The characters in this film spoke with dialogue that I was accustomed to in high school. They at times had deep thoughts and feelings to express, but otherwise they wanted general boyhood clout, and girls, or in Andrews case less bullying from his father and classmates. I understand why so many people connected with this film. I also know that not everyone will connect because everyone's life experiences differ. If you were expecting Hollywood high school, perfect scripted dialogue, and a story that is more than public school teen life, I'm glad you had no part in the production of this film. This film was realistic, and I found the boys antics to be true to nature. Often when walking home from school with my friends we pulled off some very foolish pranks that I look back on and regret. If I had super powers as a teen I would have thought about all the heroic things I could do with my powers, but first I would have honed my skills, tested them in foolish ways, and after that I may have caused enough problems on my own that helping others would be second on the agenda. In Chronicle the characters are taken down a path that is more realistic and thoughtfully paced than a sudden progression to unsightly tights and masks.I applaud the makers of this film, for not trying to make a story that is so jumbled in complexity that it looses the simple notion that a camera is following boys. I enjoyed following these characters along on their journey no matter how unsettling it or boyish it was. I was not expecting the captivating effects in the film, and I was satisfied with the CGI, it didn't annoy me at all. This movie had above par effects. Chronicle had enjoyable flight sequences that brought fun to the characters flight learning process as Iron Man did. It also had some high flying fast paced flights coupled with heart pounding moments at high altitude that were very realistic and thrilling. The flight sequences had more thoughtfulness than Superman Returns and that goes a long way in my book. On another note, I want to address the amount of invincibility the characters had. A viewer wondered why Andrew was burned so badly, when both Andrew and Matt were able to fly through concrete walls unscathed. To answer, their powers depend on forethought, just as avoiding a fork impaling took some forethought on Matt's part. Their only power is telekinesis which when used properly can allow them to fly, move objects, and keep objects away from their body. The burst of fire was unexpected and fast and likely Andrew could not shield himself mentally in time. His fireman uniform is no match for a gasoline explosion at close range. Comic book science dictates his burns. Overall a great movie, that I will buy and add to my collection.",Chronicle
473,kjgifted,"Fresh, entertaining and insightful take on superhero genre.",9,11 February 2012,"This movie works on so many levels- On the most basic level, it is a somewhat original, more realistic take on the Superhero genre. The premise is a universal one that we can all relate to – what would we do with superhero powers and how it accentuates our characteristics. Basically X-Men, well actually more Unbreakable shot with then original but now overused 'Blair Witch' hand-held camera filming style. However, this is one where that style serves it purpose as a storytelling device but also as a metaphoric hint at the increasingly more 'reality TV, look at me/celebrity' voyeuristic generation addicted to using the camera as therapy or a claim to fame. (Be it the Kim Kardashians of the world or the numerous reality shows out there) More importantly, it works a social commentary on American teenage culture as it perfectly depicts the teenager experience – the psychological effects of the home and school life, the bullying, the fickly nature of popularity, the class dynamics, friendships and family, the price of power and celebrity.And it helps that it also works on a purely entertainment level. The scenes of them discovering and developing their powers were captivating and at times humorous. Sure, it could have been slightly longer, but the fact that it works on the other two levels made it even more entertaining for me. I highly recommend the movie as it is something I will use as a teaching resource as a discussion igniter but also a template for effective storytelling and a creative writing prompt. Already the frontrunner for movie of the year, at least it'll make my top 3.",Chronicle

The story of this movie really shows and tells about a problem that is actually on the rise today such as the tragic Columbine shooting. Being a highschool student myself, popularity and the pressures to fit in definitely has a toll on teens. Dane DeHaan did an outstanding job as Andrew Detmer, really showing the struggles of a neglected highschool teen, abused by his alcoholic father, and trying to help his dying mother. Alex Russell and Michael B. Jordan also did an excellent job playing the roles Matt Garetty and Steve Montgomery.I have never really liked the first person camera perspective, but this movie really did a good job with it. And once Andrew starts to float the camera around to include himself in the recordings that made the perspective even cooler. I'm not going to spoil it for anyone who has not watched the movie, but this is definitely a must-watch. Story, actors, plot, effects, and technicality are fantastic.",Chronicle

People are complaining about the nose bleeds significance. They said their power is like a muscle you can break it if you stretch it too far past the limit you've strengthened it. The black guy moved the car early in the movie and he bled profusely as punishment comparing his face to a period.

The problem with some films is the characters are made to be entertaining, and do what they do only because it provides laughs, sadness or frustration for the audience. In some films the characters leave you thinking 'Why would you do that?' Chronicle however, scraps this. Each character has something that everyone can relate to, because everyone has friends similar to these, or may even see parts of characters within them selves, and for this I applaud the film. Seeing the development of the story and the characters makes you believe your in their world, and the 'found footage' approach only adds to this, making you feel apart of it. I genuinely find this film difficult to fault, while the sfx aren't top class they aren't over the top either. The only thing I could really nag at is the lack of explanation behind everything, which can make the film seem a little, well, empty. Although it may be possible that a sequel could answer questions about these empty gaps, I would hate to see one.

482,dylanbm21,Allegory to Drug Addiction,5,15 February 2012,"In my opinion, the creators of this film were attempting to show the dangers of drug addiction. Using these powers as a symbol for drugs, the directors showed just how far these kids were willing to push before they became hooked. They become stronger and stronger as they use their powers and are wanting new excitements. I believe this represents building a tolerance to a certain drug and wanting to try new, more powerful drugs. The point where they learn to fly, in my opinion, is the point where they find their drug of choice and are high. As we all know, with most drugs comes addiction. You can clearly see the change in Andrew's behavior as he becomes hooked. The popularity at his high school gets to him and only adds to the addiction. As he sees the consequences of his actions in front of him, he is faced with the choice to stop for the safety of others, or to continue for the pleasures he feels. The addiction has gotten to him and he chooses the path of pleasure. But, enjoyment can only last so long, and the high must come to an end eventually. In this case, we see the ultimate crash as Andrew takes a turn for the worse. Overall, this was a decent film with an incredible plot that failed to deliver.",Chronicle
483,cmpstone,"Nice change from the current superhero and ""found footage"" formulas",8,15 February 2012,"Rather than give a brief overview of the plot which can be read in the above description, I'll skip to the substance of the film to save anyone reading this some time. That said, having just left gotten home from seeing Chronicle, I can say that I enjoyed it for a number of reasons. Most importantly, what I feel this film should be commended for is changing the accepted formula for both the modern day superhero and ""found footage"" genres. It was refreshing to put a well done (albeit somewhat small budget) superhero movie into the ""boots"" of a genre (found footage) that has customarily relied on frantic camera work, tense silence, and the characters' anxiety to make them convincing and engaging stories. Chronicle relies on none of these conventional tools and is all the more successful as a result. At no point was I hoping for the camera to steady out so that I could tell what I was looking at, nor were there ever periods of black screens where the film was trying to elevate the on-screen tension.The other aspect of this film that I found interesting (especially being a 29 years old) was that this story seemed to be heavily borrowed from the 1988 anime cult classic Akira. Chronicle could probably be accused of stealing/borrowing several of the films predominant themes from Ohtomo's piece (troubled anti-social protagonist, social hierarchy issues, protagonist's lack of a family, inability to control newfound powers), but I actually found this aspect of it nostalgic and fulfilling. Afterall, who doesn't like to see a great adaptation of a classic manifested in a very convincing and widely acceptable film such as this.Film nerdery aside, this is an entertaining flick that can be watched, enjoyed, perhaps given some deeper thought as I did, and then put on the Netflix queue for a few years down the road. Do yourself the favor though if you like the two noted genres and check this one out for a nice deviation from the standard equation.",Chronicle

The commercials do not even do the film justice. I will admit, the movie did not turn out exactly how I had anticipated, but it was much better and exceeded my expectations! It was also nice for the film's ending to be different than the typical movie.First time director Josh Trank has done wonders with this movie. Not to mention at only 27, he is one of the youngest directors to have a number one movie in the United States. So many movies today use a green screen to create a background image that is not really there. A majority of the time, the product is poorly displayed and looks excruciatingly fake. The is a scene in Chronicle where the guys are speeding through the sky and in and out of the clouds. Everything looked so real and lifelike! The clouds looked just as they would if someone were to look right out of their plane window. Their flight was realistic as well. It did not seem as though the boys were hanging from the ropes used in theater plays. His film pulled me in instantly with the use of everyday situations, drama, and good laughs. I felt as though while the movie was science fiction, the activities that occurred could actually happen in real life.When it comes to surprise twists and turns, Chronicle has no shortages. This movie is filled with plenty of action, everyday situations, and real life learning experiences. Three very different teenagers accidentally uncover something mysterious, causing them to develop special abilities and a bond with one another. An unexpected friendship then blossoms between loner Andrew, ""too cool for school"" Matt, and popular Steve. The incidence that has occurred brings a lot of good times, but the teens soon learn it can also have it's downsides.Life has taken an exhilarating and exciting turn. The boys learn to work with and control their powers. They use these amazing abilities in various ways to create harmless fun and laughs. Not all happy moments are permanent, and just as in any new situation, with good, always comes some bad. Matt, Andrew, and Steve must learn to compose themselves, and will discover their actions have harsh consequences.",Chronicle
485,kmanibo1,A very well made movie would be an understatement.,9,17 February 2012,"Chronicle is the first thrilling, captivating and intense movie that I've been so satisfied to see this year. The first scenes did start off with quite a negative mood; it was a bit slow in the beginning but picked up as the movie progressed. The events building up to the ending were well directed. The POV, shaky camera movement wasn't too nauseating unlike some other POV movies (Cloverfield, District 9, etc.) and was put to good use. The acting was marvelous. Dane DeHaan completely fit the role of the stereotypical ""loser"" in high school, and he was convincing when the movie continued on. At the end, the emotions I had about his character were so strong. I was angry at his character, I was irritated with his character. I was even scared at one point. His background really helps to show how he became who he was at the end. Everything came together. As for Alex Russell and Michael B. Jordan, their acting was flawless as well. This wasn't some cheesy half-assed acting. It was the real deal. The plot was pretty original in my opinion. I thought it was different, and that's what makes this movie stand out from all the others this year.The ending was pretty satisfactory for me. Though I was disappointed that we never really got to know what the whole alien sort of thing was in the beginning, Mark does say he'll find answers. So at least the directors didn't end the film with us wondering too much about it. The whole part about leaving the camera on, I think that really shows how true of a friend Mark is, that although something came between friends, they still were friends up until the end. I left the movie feeling satisfied.I wasn't ever bored except in the beginning, where obviously nothing really happened. I was on the edge of my seat many, many times.I really would recommend watching Chronicle. Though a bit bloody and violent, it's not any more violent than movies out there these days. Chronicle made my heart beat and I found my hand over my mouth at times. Please give this movie a try, I guarantee you'll at least find something good about it. :)",Chronicle

I was really rooting for this movie thanks to another great Hollywood preview hook. Sadly I sat through the entire thing hoping for it to finally pull itself together and bring something truly original, or at least classic or simple plain mindless entertainment...none of the above. Awful acting and copycat filming with special effects borrowed poorly from Hancock (really enjoyed Hancock) Anyone claiming original filmography with incredible action sequences need to put the dope down. I have lenience for poor acting....but the story was hollow and substanceless. I'm not even searching for some non existent lesson hidden within, I just wanted pure entertainment, simple time consuming enjoyment....no such luck here.

487,kevinperrette,Ruined by weaknesses,5,21 February 2012,"I am giving a second fair warning in telling the reviewer that this review will contain several spoilers. Do not read on if you do not wish to know what happens.In trailers, this movie is incredibly appealing to the average moviegoer. Three teenagers obtain telepathic powers but one starts to abuse their power. After hearing what a few of my friends had to say about the movie, I went to see it with very high expectations. I tend to look deeper into movies than most people around me seem to.Starting off with the hits. The movie does a very good job of capturing what late high school life is like. The behaviors of the characters were all very realistic from the parties to the way the characters themselves acted. Another great thing the movie did was it kept you in your seat. Gimmick movies like these are always interesting simply for the fact that you don't know what the characters are going to do next.The hits of the movie are greatly over looked in my opinion due to the number of weaknesses this movie had. Character and story development were not created as well as they should have been. Matt seems to have an ex-girlfriend I assume but not a whole lot is really known about their relationship. It's almost as if she's just in the movie to take up time. The father-son relationship between Andrew and his father is a mystery to me. What in their past causes Andrew's father to be so angry all the time other than Andrew's dying mother? One thing that modern films seem to have a fancy for is the whole video camera deal. Just personal opinion, I don't like it. It's not a very good fad for big movies. The death of Steve in the movie didn't have the emotion I expected. Matt seemed to completely under react against Andrew, knowing Andrew had killed Steve. Last but not least, one of the biggest issues I have with most modern movies, impossible situations. In the climatic moments of the movie, Matt and Andrew are fighting to the death in the city. Watching these two beat the hell out of each other and destroy buildings in the process gives me the impression that they're both just about invincible. Smashing into buildings and doing considerable damage to said building doesn't seem to do much harm to the characters, yet Andrew was able to be impaled and killed. Sort of insults me as the movie viewer. I gave this movie a 5 out of 10. The hits in the movie were great but there were just so many weaknesses the movie had that I didn't feel completely satisfied when I left the theater.",Chronicle

The Blair Witch project had the same effect on me. I really wish the studios would put some kind of warning on films like this as I know I'm not the only person that has this problem.That said, the bits that I opened my eyes for - mainly when Andrew had put down the 'hand held' camera or the point of view switched to a CCTV shot - were quite inventive and entertaining. The adolescent humour was good too, although a little clichéd in parts. I think it's a real shame the shaky camera work went through most of the film as it would have been sufficient for just the first couple of scenes to be that way to make the point. Most people would not notice if there was a gradual transition to professional footage.",Chronicle

492,smullegugg,"It was, on the whole, a quite okay movie.",6,3 March 2012,"I saw this movie last night and I can say that it was very okay. I saw the trailer about two hours before we went to see it, and I did probably expect more. I thought that the movie was about these teens getting powers, and as in all the Hollywood movies with a group of people that gets powers, one would go bad and the others would try at first to help but then wouldn't be able to. This was not exactly what I got. It's something along that line, but I missed a few pieces.Following text will contain SPOILERS:These kids finds some kind of cave, and get powers, but you never find out WHAT is was that gave them the powers, or if it was dangerous. It might be a second movie or something like that which will explain it, but on its own the story is missing some pieces. On the other hand, when you're watching the film, you aren't really wondering about it until it ends. I was watching and liking the movie most part because it contained and okay story, it contained very, very, good effects and also quite good acting. It builds up properly to the end, it was no rushing it but neither boring. Also you get and insight in the life of one of the teens, Andrew, and you understand him and what he does. The story had some other holes, but the acting and the effects that made the action very nice, made up for them. It is a movie that should be watched. I can't say if I will see it twice, but I do not regret seeing it in the theaters.I give it a 6. /Henrik",Chronicle

Chronicle should have been at best, a movie of the week on the Sci-Fi channel. The plot went no where, you never found out how the kids get these powers, and the ending is god awful!!! The camera angles were annoying and made me feel sick and the special effects and green screen were worthless. I don't understand how anyone rated this over a one. I love super-hero anything and thought this movie would be great to see what teens who acquire super powers, would do with them, but this sucked!!! The writing was garbage (a actually laughed at how stupid some of the lines were), the plot non-existent and answered no questions, and then the just wrap it up with a crappy, completely predictable bad ending.",Chronicle

Movies don't have to be totally realistic, but when they're well done, we should be able to ""suspend our disbelief"". Through a combination of sub-par plot development and scenes that felt too over the top, at times it just seemed silly. I also had difficulty with Andrew's character -- rather than finding myself emotionally invested in understanding and caring about his internal struggles, I largely just felt annoyed. I also felt like there should have been more depth to the ""sci-fi"" aspect: I felt unsatisfied by the lack of further development on how this all came about or if there was any deeper connection between the origin of the powers and any of the plot elements. Sure, we can be left to make our own conjectures, but the film gives little to build from.(Purposefully left this vague to avoid plot spoilers)",Chronicle

The plot about the abused high school kid who decides to film everything is not bad if it were a serious movie about bullying shown in schools, this seems like another attempt to make a really cheap movie and steal as much cash from people as possible, (although some special effects are OK, the whole flight scene was a waste of time)and yes the special effects would have cost a penny or two, it still seems like any first year film student could have thrown it together.",Chronicle

You will have feelings, will cheer, will smile and one scene will definitely make you have a ""i wish i could do that"" moment. After that, i think whoever was funding this project came and said, ""Ok this movie has to be done and we don't have any more money."" And it shows. its so painful you will need the courage from the first 1/3, in my opinion you can leave out the patience and you wont regret not finishing the movie. Things just happen, people just appear in certain locations, important characters just die, ITS REALLY AWFUL I TELL YOU! One of the worst endings of a film project.

498,sunil-mehla-87,Amazing treatment of an age old concept,8,3 May 2012,"Saw this movie without knowing any backgrounds or even hints about what it was going to be. Super hero movies usually turn people off because the topic is so worn out. The latest trend had been to use a character much more closer to realty like kick-ass instead of Bruce Wayne or Spiderman.The camera handling in this movie is best to be characterized as a ""deliberate amateurish type"". I don't know whether this works only on me or to others like fans of ""paranormal activities"". The idea was to first let people realize that the content is ordinary and yet engraving with the suspense entering soon enough before people start loosing focus. The extreme contrasts of a concept like super powers and the ""amateur camera handling"" is such a power tool to keep the people hooked.The content of the story was an expression of teen emotions. It was not a ""superhero stuff"" or ""save the world"" and much more about the emotional impact of a change in life.The special effects demand a special mention. They were definitely pro and not down scaled to the camera level and just apt for the treatment required. The sounds were amazingly cool.The climax was a little sad though. The good wins, again over bad, again realizing its not the man who is bad but his choices and yet it leaves you injured, knowing the actions of Andrew as pure evil but so sentimental.Overall a thrilling and a must watch for people loving this sort of camera handling.",Chronicle

Its just random scenes thrown together for the hell of it (spoilers from here) then the 'loser' character gets a chick, then he gets sick (on her) and he goes psychotic. Its just plain rubbish. They bounce of walls and fly around in circles and its all over. No meaning, no journey, very little in the way of story telling. The only thing this film has going for it is the CGI probably where 11 of the 12 million budget went.Chronicle for me (you might feel different and that's OK) is a film about nothing.",Chronicle
500,oscarbr,Boring and predictable.,4,9 May 2012,"I just have three words to describe this movie: Akira meets Cloverfield.To expand on why I say it's boring and predictable. You know right away that the whole thing will be centered around a typical teenager who has a very hard time dealing with the realities of life and is a depressed loner. Give that type of person some power, and you get what happens during the whole movie. It's quite smart how they step away from the hand held shots (reality movies like Cloverfield and one of the ones that started all this trend: The Blair Witch Project) by letting the main character use his powers to film in a much more stable and general view kind of shot. A release from the confinements that allow film makers to get away with cutting of on difficult to solve shots by killing the continuity with simply having the character filming turning off the camera for some reason or another. This makes the film feel more like an actual movie and not some home made thing and for some cool effect shots.The movie never engages you. Most of the time you just loathe the whinny teenager and hope for a quick ending. You know things will NEVER go his way, because the plot needs that, so it's all very predictable and boring.Don't pay movie tickets, rent it.",Chronicle
501,thekindofbroken,Obviously Not a Film for Everyone,9,21 May 2012,"After watching the trailer for Chronicle, I was really excited to go see this movie. The thing that sets this movie apart from others is the script, which is written as if the characters are ACTUALLY teenage boys in high school. The actors are given lines in which they backtrack, struggle to build cohesive sentences, and generally talk like a real human being rather than an extremely articulate unrealistic character. I noticed this in the trailer and that's what actually encouraged me to see the movie. Another interesting difference between this film and other found footage films was the flexibility of the camera. Because the characters are telekinetic, the camera was able to move in more traditional shots as the film (and their powers) progressed. This also allowed all three of the main characters to be on screen at the same time. This film also follows a much more realistic point of view on how teenage boys would behave if they suddenly developed super powers (playing pranks on each other and generally causing chaos). I mean, what's the likelihood that they'd actually dress up in spandex and defend civilians? Come on, they're in high school. Now, despite my personal enjoyment of the film, I am 100% sure this is not a film that everyone will enjoy. In fact, I think you'll either love or hate it. I don't think there's any great way to tell if you'll like the film or not, but here's some things that I think could help you decide. -If you easily get motion sick, don't see this movie. While I think it's much smoother than many found footage films, it's not like watching your average movie. -If what you're looking for is a straight up superhero movie, don't see this movie. That's not what it's trying to be and you will be disappointed.-If you're looking for a movie that doesn't expect you to think, don't see this movie. This film isn't about cheap thrills and explosions. If you see it and that's what you think, you missed something. HOWEVER-If you are or have recently been in high school, I think you might enjoy this movie. These guys are so realistic, it'll be like seeing your friends on screen. -If you're looking for a movie that approaches a popular subject in a completely original and harsher way, see this movie. It's different and it's fresh. -If you tend to like small budget artistic films, this could easily be a film for you.",Chronicle

Instead of being a pleasant diversion, it turned out to be top-notch sci-fi with an emotional gut punch.I'm not spoiling anything to say that you see the ending coming, but you see it in the way that a person in a crosswalk sees an oncoming car. You know it's coming, but you also know you can't do anything to stop it. The way this director builds tension is really cool.The young actors are amazing. They each have a stereotypical character, but the script and the actors turn each one into more than a stereotype. The emotionally damaged Andrew is great, but doesn't upstage his cousin Matt, the rational good kid, or the popular ""candidate for class president"" Steve. The three of them and the camera bring us into their world of weirdness, and we feel privy to a secret as they experiment with their new abilities, playing pranks and just giggling at the silliness of it all. Matt manages to convey the idea of ""with great power comes great responsibility"" without using the trite language of a comic book. Steve honestly tries to help Andrew but doesn't realize that he's too damaged to be helped. And Andrew, for his part, is so emotionally wounded that your heart goes out to him even though you realize he's beyond redemption.Good movie. See it.",Chronicle

Do not let the ""shaky cam"" or hand-held cam discourage you from watching this movie because it is only like that for the very beginning. It does not detract from this movie at all. Anyways, The characters are young adults who happen to stumble upon super powers. The movie does a good job of keeping pace with the boys as they learn to use their newly acquired abilities. My favorite character was the main character because he is a socially awkward boy with a poor relationship with his family and friends. He grows and changes as the story progresses and that's where things become really interesting. I feel like I can relate to the main protagonist because he begins to feel resentful towards people once he becomes more powerful. While this movie succeeds in many places (football scene in the sky and the car crushing scene) the ending was a bit unfortunate and lacked closure. Nevertheless it was an excellent film and deserves your attention.",Chronicle

I thought the story was pretty good and i wished i could have seen the end of it but i never would have lasted. What the hell was the director thinking? I know some people can handle shots like that but to do a whole movie like that was brutal. And it seemed very pointless to shoot it like that as well. Anybody wanna tell me how it ended?

Now a days movies and stories that have super heroes show two sides to gaining power, becoming a good superhero or a bad supervillan. They don't show the actual struggle of fighting a power that is stronger than the human who gained it. This movie does show that. they don't put on a mask and start fighting crime, they do what anyone their age would do. Use it for pranks and messing with people. They use the powers in a more realistic way, its probably the same way I would react. Then the film turns and shows how the power affects Andrew. He turns into a crazy power house, killing anyone because he can. Someone with his background would end up the same way. He could not handle all that power and he let it overtake him. This film tells the story perfectly. The acting was great and so was the effects. The scene where they fly through the clouds took my breath away, it looked so real.

509,olis_redan,"Although fun in places, this is not compelling or original. Calling it mediocre is being generous.",1,29 October 2012,"So, where to start? Well, let's start with the positives. First of all, the special effects are passable for the budget allowed (though not seamless nor entirely convincing) and, secondly, there are moments of genuine enjoyment to be had, the scene where the three teenagers have a close encounter with a jumbo jet being one example. The idea of telekinesis is a pretty cool one when done well, and I have to say the film did not screw up enough to make that aspect detrimental to the story. It actually seemed a desirable thing to have despite that completely unnecessary spider scene. However, there are quite a lot of mediocre qualities in this film, which in my opinion is worse than the bad qualities it displays. The real problem with Chronicle is that the ideas involved and the execution are singularly the most uninspired I have yet to witness this year (or indeed the past few years, if I am to be honest). Not a single trope was subverted or averted and not a single twist or surprise occurred. This was a very by-the-numbers way of story telling. For example - the troubled teen becomes a violent psycho after he realises the enormity of his power. Sounds like a simple concept. Well, it is a simple concept. It's just a shame it wasn't used to explore other areas of Andrew's thinking or demonstrate to him just how precarious his emotional situation was before passing the moral event-horizon. It was a simple idea told in a simple manner. Hell, even the kind black guy snuffs it first. There's another example right there. They had might as well have given him a red shirt. It truly felt like I could (and often did) guess what was going to happen next, merely through being well versed in how movies stereotypically tell their tale.The big fight at the end wasn't the war between morals and choice I had (foolishly) expected it to be. It was simply a matter of stop-the- nutter. The morals explored in the movie not only went over old ground covered better by it's peers but also had nothing new to bring to the table. The process of the teen going from troubled to psycho is, how can I put this... two dimensional. There was no depth to his character development, as if he trundled along a predestined path, unable to make independent decisions. The bullying portrayed seemed like it was written in by someone who had never actually been bullied, having only seen it happen to others, let alone the abuse by the father. These factors that supposedly led to Andrew going nuts are done in such a limp manner that they are entirely unconvincing, leading to the undermining of Andrew's character and his later motivations.The same went for his cousin. To begin with he was merely a tool to enable the psycho to gain his powers and after that he was simply a reactionary or background device. Toward the end he was almost continuously telling his cousin to cut it out, to stop what he was doing, not once showing initiative with the sole exception of using that spear.And then we get onto the camera work. Granted, it did the job but it was unnecessarily of the found footage style. While this is just my opinion on the matter, I think that the film would have greatly benefited taking one of two routes - either stick with a single camera POV or use the traditional methods. The fact that this movie 'uses' footage from differing cameras (Andrew's camera, the girlfriend's camera, public footage, police cameras) entirely undermines the point of the found footage style. If they were going for a documentary style, why didn't they use that? I think this might boil down to poor direction, ultimately, and could have shone just that little bit brighter had someone with a flair for the unusual was at the helm.The dialogue is at times stilted and at others downright awful, the script could have done with a hell of a lot more polish and, let's be fair, the love interest could have done with a shot in the arm.Unfortunately, the downsides far, far outweigh the positive sprinkles and I heartily recommend you find something else to watch.

And based on the reactions (or lack thereof) of everyone else in the theater I was not alone.Based on some of the reviews I've read since, I'm almost under the impression that there are currently two movies out with the same title, it would be the only explanation that makes sense.Lets see; there is no plot; there is zero character development so I was never engaged and didn't care what happened to any of them; there was zero suspense; there is no explanation or even attempt of an explanation; hand-held camera footage is really bad for a complete movie.Wait, there is one good thing about the movie; it only goes for 95 minutes.It was bad, and not even in a good way.",Chronicle
511,anad-119,it could be better,6,10 May 2013,"entertaining nice but it could be better, there is Idea that no matter what what you do make or what do you have still the opinion of parents will effect you the most , it's very nice movie worth the time but i wish it ends in better way using the camera on the way documentary films was beautiful and smart, making this project a more enjoyable, time was an important factor was not long and boring, but unfortunately i still have a big issue with the ending it could be better , and in this movie you don't need to bay a blue-ray version in the end it's not batman or the iron man but for me it's more enjoyable then iron-man if you have time and nothing to watch , watch it",Chronicle

I won't give it less than 3 stars because objectively I know that there are of course much worse movies than this one.",Chronicle
513,cruzin920,I Am The Apex Predator (Spoilers Inbound!),8,12 December 2014,"Chronicle, directed by Josh Trank and written by Max Landis, is a layered, super-powered character study, an entertaining exploration of a troubled teen's psyche. Filmed in the ""found-footage"" style of horror films such as The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity, Chronicle follows Andrew Detmer (Dane DeHaan), a downtrodden, isolated teen, along with his cousin Matt Detmer (Alex Russell) and popular class president Steve (Michael B. Jordan) as they learn to control and develop their newfound telekinetic abilities, inspiring mischief that later builds into destructive mayhem. In terms of cinematography, the ""found-footage"" style is executed very well, and makes the film feel more immersive. The opening scene depicts our protagonist Andrew setting up a digital movie camera as his father attempts to break into his room. Andrew announces aloud, ""I bought a camera and I'm filming everything from here on out."" Most of the film is presented through Andrew's camera (in addition to camera phones and security cameras), though it is not certain whether he is documenting his life for himself or wishes to share his life with an audience. In conjunction with the ""found-footage"" style, there is barely any music in the film, as it would mean that Andrew would have to accompany his video diaries with a soundtrack. The only exception would be the car radio in an early scene in the film. Finally, the special effects are utilized as the telekinetic hi-jinks begin, and kick into overdrive as the film enters its finale.Andrew doesn't have it easy, and Dane DeHaan gives a great performance in portraying the disconnected teen. Andrew's aforementioned father, an ex-firefighter, is now an unemployed, abusive alcoholic. Andrew's mom is bedridden, afflicted with an unspecified disease. Andrew's only friend is his cousin Matt, also a high school senior, who drives him to and from school. At school, Andrew is an outcast, eating lunch by himself on the bleachers and often targeted by bullies. Things begin to pick up when Matt drags Andrew along to a rave party, in order to crack his shell a bit. Outside the party, Andrew is found by Steve, the confident, well-liked class president who excitedly urges him to follow with the camera. Steve, Andrew and Matt (who was already by the hole) climb down into a cave, encountering a strange glowing object before the camera blacks out. In the next scene, the boys are already testing their new abilities, with no explanation on how they escaped the cave or what the object did to them. This oversight indicates the writer's intention to focus on character reactions and interactions in place of an overarching plot. In his essay entitled, ""The Hero Defines the Genre, the Genre Defines the Hero,"" Peter Coogan establishes ""mission, powers and identity"" as the defining traits of a superhero and his/her narrative. The boys of Chronicle are gifted with extraordinary abilities but are lacking in the mission and identity criteria. Some of the movie's best scenes are when the boys are screwing around with their new powers, pulling pranks and flying around. No one displays ambitions to use their powers to benefit anyone, like a hero would. Andrew even asks Matt if he has thought of doing anything more with his powers while they skipped rocks at a lake, to which he replied, ""No."" While they don't reveal their abilities to anyone outside the circle, their identities still remain intact as high school kids. Interestingly enough in a film where teens receive super powers, the word ""hero"" was not uttered at all. The boys are not super heroes, but simply teenagers, each with issues and insecurities. This route may've been taken to provide a more ""realistic"" depiction of a bunch of kids gifted with extraordinary power. Thus, this film could be better categorized as a teen power fantasy rather than a superhero film. It's safe to say that teenagers were the primary target audience of this film, featuring a high school setting and themes such as fitting in. However, the promise of superpowers is sure to attract younger and adult viewers as well. Despite not being a traditional superhero narrative, this film tackles one of the genre's greatest themes: power and responsibility. ""With great power comes great responsibility"" is a quote often attributed to Uncle Ben of The Amazing Spider-Man series, Peter Parker's deceased uncle. Peter takes these words to heart as Spider-Man, vowing to use his abilities for the good of New York City. Unfortunately, Andrew doesn't have such guidance. As the film runs, his mother's conditions worsens and his relationship with his father deteriorates. His abilities only amplify his isolation, warping his sensibilities as his powers grow stronger. In one scene in the latter half of the film, Andrew uses his telekinesis to toy with a spider, lifting it in the air before separating its limbs and killing it. This scene serves as a window into Andrew's head while also foreshadowing what's to come. Despite not having a specific mission or purpose, Andrew uses his newfound power to exert his long repressed will, even for all the wrong reasons.Chronicle is not a wholly original film, owing many ideas to film and comic predecessors such as The X-Men, Carrie and Akira. However, Chronicle was successful on putting a fresh spin on the superhero origin narrative. Featuring a troubled, compelling, and sometimes relatable protagonist, this film weaves a story of corruption well-adapted to the computer age through a smart utilization of the ""found-footage"" gimmick. Despite being set on such a massive scale thanks to the extraordinary abilities of the main cast, at its core, this film can be viewed better as a psychological analysis of a damaged psyche. This is a great directorial debut for Josh Trank and I'm looking forward to what he does for the upcoming 2015 Fantastic Four film.",Chronicle
514,aborunda,Why aren't people talking more about this film?,8,27 February 2012,"My first thought after walking out of the theater was, why isn't there more buzz around this film? ""Chronicle"" does with more success what all the ""Avengers"" prequels, Shyamalan's ""Unbreakable"" attempted to do, namely, to show an origin story related to acquired super powers.I will not expand on the plot here, but suffice to say that it falls in the genre of ""found footage"" a la ""Cloverfield"", ""Blair Witch"", or ""Paranormal Activity."" It follows three high school friends as they witness an event that leaves them changed, and the impact of those changes on their lives in the weeks and months after.The three main actors have very good chemistry and this helps along the film. The special effects are a testimony to how inexpensive FX computer software and hardware have become because they are very realistic and lend an air of authenticity to the film.Even though many of the elements in the film have been explored before in films such as ""Spider Man"", ""Thor"", ""Superman"", and TV shows like ""Heroes"" and ""The X Files"", I don't believe they have been shown in this particular combination and that makes this story seem new.The changes that the characters undergo, both psychological and physical are well portrayed and lend an air of inevitability to the final act.I think this film is one of those unappreciated gems that will gain more credit as times passes. I highly recommend it.",Chronicle

My favorite movie ever.",Chronicle
517,tonimatanas,One of the worst movies I have ever seen,1,3 September 2018,"It was very boring. I get the free camera style, this didn't bother me although it did bother most of the people that I saw this film with. I also watched it alone because the first time I saw it, I found the movie to be extremely boring so I decided to give it another chance since I wasn't really paying attention. The second time I watched it I was left with the same impression. Nothing was happening and the plot was extremely monotonous. The dialogues were useless. Nothing of importance was said. At times they were screaming and at other times they took pauses between sentences but you could hear their mouths and saliva which was not really nice.The movie was not only dull and boring but also annoying. The special effects were... nothing special.Why did I decide to watch it? I saw the reviews and the IMDB rating and I thought that I should check it out. Don't waste your time. If you hate someone suggest them to watch the movie but tell the to wait till the end because ""something amazing happens"". Nothing will happen and they will have lost their time.TL;DR Boring movie, meaningless dialogues, no plot, annoying screaming. Do yourself a favour and don't watch it. Unbreakable and Split are two movies that I would suggest now that we are on the subject.",Chronicle
518,billypics,Kill Me Now,4,2 June 2012,"Three of the dumbest teenagers on planet Earth (and that's amongst fierce competition at their high school) acquire powers that far from turning them into super heroes, turns them in to ultra dumb fatheads with incredible super powers, who apart from shouting and whooping at each other (do all American kids truly behave like that? It's exhausting) at every given opportunity, spend an in ordinate amount of the picture spouting banal dialogue (12 year olds would get it perhaps) and being completely thick. I know when we're young we're unworldly and naive and given to making rash judgements and poor decisions, but these guys get the award stereotypical teen movie morons. Of course its in the script - if indeed there was one for much of the dialogue seemed off the cuff and spontaneous. The three principles are really good at their craft, working with what was a clichéd portrait of American schools and teens. Yuh know, the school bullies, the cheer leaders, the party animals right down to the local neighbourhood thugs in Andrew's (one of the three boys and principal characters) Piney leafy neighbourhood, albeit a neighbourhood that's distressed and low rent. I got very frustrated by the illogical and banal dialogue and just couldn't see how the three boys could continue to be around each other as they spent a lot of time at loggerheads and being macho (Yawn!) with each other. As long as you're not looking for any intellectual approach to the script this will satisfy those who have been missing Superman lately and in fact at times it put me in mind of one of the early Superman movies with Christopher Reeve. Its Schlock as far as I'm concerned, but kids will probably identify with it.... sadly! Good performances from Alex Russell and Michael B Jordan and a truly terrifying performance from Michael Kelly as Andrew's drunken sadistic father.",Chronicle
519,soiajake,Incredible Surprise,10,10 April 2013,"This movie completely astounded me. I've never been very ""hot"" on found-footage style movies, even back in the 90's Blair Witch was pretty boring. The creators of Chronicle really peeled back the skin of this concept and made a film that entertains on so many levels.The emotion of growing up is captured perfectly by our three very different characters. The trials they put themselves through are incredible analogies to the steps we take through adolescence. The action is given the perfect amount of space in the film to really blow you away when things ramp up. The plot twists are jarring, emotional, and will leave you with this exceptional ""I can't blink"" feeling.I highly recommend not reading spoilers or in depth summaries for this movie - as I did, my expectations were battling the film nearly the whole movie. When I began to realize Hollywood salt did not denigrate the creative process of this film, I was even more thrilled and entertained. A+. Can't wait for a sequel.",Chronicle
