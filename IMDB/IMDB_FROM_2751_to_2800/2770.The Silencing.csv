0,Leofwine_draca,Spare thriller,5,14 November 2021,"A low budget thriller for an out of work ex-GAME OF THRONES star. Just kidding, I do like Coster-Waldau, but this sombre thriller doesn't really do much with his charisma or his talents, and it's one of those spare kind of films that you just wish had more going for it. Coster-Waldau is this reclusive guy living out in the woods who becomes involved in the hunt for a child murderer. Little plot, and that which does exist is predictable, although a fair bit of quite well shot action; it's unbelievable the punishment our hero goes through in this one.",The Silencing

When it is discovered teenage girls are being hunted, Rayburn wants to find the killer as much as Alice (Annabelle Wallis), the newly elected sheriff. Her brother has issues and becomes an early suspect. Victims have their vocal cords cut so we can have a title to the film. They are hunted ancient school with an atlatl.This is a mystery without a lot of characters. Alice was the interesting character, a newly elected sheriff who wants to protect her brother who has brushes with the law. This leads to an interesting unexpected scene later in the film.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",The Silencing
2,classicsoncall,"""I only took the ones that no one would miss.""",6,15 July 2021,"The most curious thing about this picture is why Sheriff Alice Gustafson (Annabelle Wallis) would shoot Rayburn Swanson (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) to protect her brother (Hero Fiennes Tiffin), who at the time looked like a suspect in the abduction and murder of young teenage girls. Neighboring town law officer Karl Blackhawk (Zahn McClarnon) put her on notice of suspension (how does that work?), but then it didn't amount to anything because Alice was back on duty immediately. Something here wasn't thought out very well.Well, I don't know about that sasquatch outfit the killer was wearing. It did provide a pretty good disguise, but it looked kind of weird at the same time. If it's purpose was to scare potential victims it probably worked. The motivation for Dr. Boone (Shaun Smyth) to go out and target young women because his daughter was killed in a hit and run seemed kind of suspect to me.Was there a reason for Brooks (Tiffin) to kidnap Sam Moonblood (Gregory Odjig) and tie him up in a deserted building? If so, I didn't catch it.There seems to be a penchant for a lot of the more recent movies I've seen to be filmed with crucial scenes almost completely in the dark. Fine, if the story calls for it, but even so, how about letting the viewer see what's going on. Early in this picture, Rayburn's animal trap pit was revealed having upturned spikes upon which a large animal might be impaled. You felt that maybe this would have figured in the resolution of the story when the time came, and it does, but how many viewers would have forgotten about it when Rayburn had that final struggle with Boone . You had to remember that earlier set up, otherwise it just looked like Boone fell into a completely dark hole and didn't come out, leaving you to wonder why.",The Silencing
3,bombersflyup,Wildling Pictures aye.,6,20 July 2020,"The Silencing is a solid film, despite not having considerable dialogue or delving very deep.Nikolaj Coster-Waldau's certainly one of the ""Game of Thrones"" cast members capable of carrying a film. It's a little far-fetched though, someone doesn't just become a monster overnight, that and happening to see something on the cameras and happening to be in the doctor's office and being able to get there so quick. There's a missed opportunity to take it up a notch, after the minor twist, but unfortunately it's just put to the side.",The Silencing
4,deloudelouvain,Good thriller but not perfect.,7,8 January 2021,"The are a lot of positive things to write about The Silencing, although not everything was perfect, but the positives outweigh the negative. The story is interesting and captivating to follow. The acting is very good and that from the entire cast. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as the leading character did a very fine job. The cinematography was also top, good editing and quality images. But the story could have been a little bit better what could have result in a higher rating. For example when somebody gets an arrow in the heart region and gets shot in the stomach, or another steps in a bear trap, and they both can walk around or even run and fight like nothing happened to them it's just not that believable and that brings the quality down. Other than that it was very enjoyable to watch, with the right amount of suspense and a nice twist that could have been more elaborated though.",The Silencing
5,ops-52535,this is a cloaked twinn peaks,6,18 July 2020,"Ive seen better movies on this subject/topic, and that is because there are too many inconsistencies and loud screams of ludocrisity done by the caracters in the plot. a superindependent sheriff that does the lonesome ride everywhere danger is, and the parkkeepers lack or will of communicating with police and others in dire situations, a w/t or a cell might have given some truthfulness working or not, or a simple houseline phone or better. its also hard to understand the police juristictions and the way law enforcement are dealt with, it just becomes deadwater where there are no push to be found.acting wise, and the filmographic presentation are well done, much thanks to the choice of locations and nature scenery, but the story are plotted like good old ''twin peaks'', extremely slow, and wait till next weekend to get another clue.its a film that will enerve some and make others bite nails from the nerves, the grumpy old man liked the first one third the rest is for you to decide. its a recommend anyway",The Silencing
6,Thanos_Alfie,Simple but interesting...,6,31 July 2020,"""The Silencing"" is an Action - Thriller movie in which we watch a father trying to find the man behind the kidnap of his child while he has to deal with his addiction in alcohol. Soon he will realize that his daughter was not the only victim and he has to do his best in order to find that man.I have to admit that I did not have high expectations from this movie but I was happily surprised by it because it was not only a nice and interesting movie but it was more than this. The direction which was made by Robin Pront who is also the writer, it was very good and I believe that he did an excellent job on focusing and presenting his main characters problems, history and goals. This had as a result to make us not only relate to them but also to feel that we are a part of it, something that made his movie far more interesting. Finally, I have to say that the interpretations of both Nikolaj Coster-Waldau who played as Rayburn and Annabelle Wallis who played as Gustafson were very good. I highly recommend everyone to watch this movie because it is a nice thriller with a simple but interesting plot and some very good interpretations.",The Silencing
7,Tweetienator,Good Enuff,6,2 October 2020,"A solid and decent thriller - nothing new on the Western front one may be dared to quote. The cast and production is solid, the story good enough, and last but not least it is nice to watch Nikolaj Coster-Waldau again (he was the main reason why I gave The Silencing a try). Recommended if you liked Wind River (2017). Precise rate: 5.5",The Silencing

This movie has ample amount of tension n suspense. It started without wasting any time n at the same time it delivered developed characters n background stories.
The twist came as a surprise.
The plot may remind viewers of Nic Cage's Frozen, Renner's Wind River n Most Dangerous Game.
The story is about an alcoholic ex hunter who has become an animal savior n lives secluded in a sanctuary named aft his daughter who has been missing since five years. The arrival of a new sheriff brings some hope in the method of investigation but things get ugly aft a discovery of a female teen's dead body pointing to a killer who is hunting teens for sport.",The Silencing
9,gwnightscream,Pretty Good Thriller,6,27 February 2021,"This 2020 thriller stars Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and Annabelle Wallis.

11,jtindahouse,A well acted and twisty thriller movie well worth your time,8,25 July 2020,"'The Silencing' had all the things I love in a film. It had unexpected moments sprinkled throughout, a lead character I liked and wanted to be alright in the end, a whodunnit element and some twists. What more could you ask for from a thriller? This was the type of movie that was coming out every week back in the 90s, and they were all great, yet these days you're lucky if you get one every couple of months and they're not usually as good as they used to be. So when I come across one as well done as this film was it is a rare treat.Nikolaj Coster-Waldau from 'Game of Thrones' plays the lead role, and he was a remarkably good lead-man. Not only is he naturally likeable but he is also very easy to sympathise with. His character has had something awful happen to him and so he has become an alcohol and can be quite unpleasant to his ex-wife's husband for example. Sometimes these characters can be very hard to get onboard with if they're played by the wrong actor, but in this case I was happy to look past his flaws and get on-side with him.As mentioned earlier I really like a good whodunnit. They're incredibly out of fashion these days unfortunately, but 'The Silencing' is a great reminder of how well they can work in cinema. I really enjoyed this movie and would highly recommend people give it a watch.",The Silencing
12,jadavix,Mediocre thriller,5,20 December 2020,"""The Silence"" is a very mediocre thriller that doesn't do anything particularly well, except perhaps for Coster-Waldau's performance.The script is sort of underwritten and overwritten at the same time. There are too many characters and too many extraneous scenes. This is a thriller; it needs to be taut, without a scene wasted. It wastes many scenes, and you stop paying attention.The twists and turns were uninvolving and sometimes made little sense. There is one bizarre turn around where a previously heroic character goes bad, and then the movie seems to forget about it later. They were apparently willing to kill to protect a family member, who they believe is a serial killer?There is also a backstory for Coster-Waldau's protagonist that fails to convince. It needed to be hinted at strongly, not involved unconvincingly.",The Silencing
13,kwenchow,"Another worst thriller film! Too many boring conversation, and overuse scene! Not recommended!",1,8 August 2020,"This film start with a female dead body floating along the river, and a man ""Rayburn"" stop two men for hunting in the wildlife sanctuary scene! As turnout, this film is to find out who is the mastermind of the killing of a series of young girls, including the daughter of Rayburn! The mastermind actually is Dr. Boone! Entire film full of boring conversation, and overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the driving scene, overuse of the aerial river scene, overuse of the searching things scene, and overuse of the watching surveillance video footage scene! Make the film unwatchable! All the action scene have blood at certain point, but overall portray by sideways! Not intense at all! Barely intense scene is, Rayburn fighting with Dr. Boone in the kitchen! At the end, Rayburn push Dr. Boone inside the animal trap, and let him rot in there! That's it!

14,henry8-3,The Silencing,4,2 March 2021,"Coaster-Waldau is a heavy drinking game reserve keeper whose daughter was murdered some years before. When young girls start getting hunted and killed again he and separately, sheriff Annabelle Wallis start investigating.After a dullish first half there are enough twists and turns in the plot to make this a diverting time filler, albeit the 2 leads lack any form of charisma making it difficult to empathise / get remotely excited. Gets better as it progresses but ultimately only a so so effort.",The Silencing
15,jimbo-53-186511,"Unfocused, slow-moving and nowhere near thrilling enough",4,29 March 2021,"Reformed hunter Rayburn who is living in a remote sanctuary finds himself in a deadly battle of wits against a madman whom is not only targetting Rayburn, but is also hunting young women as well. With the help of Sheriff Gustafson, Rayburn tries to find out who it is who is responsible for attacking him and the young women, but the truth may lie closer to home...The Silencing has all the right ingredients and had a lot of potential so it's a shame really to see most of it wasted in what is ultimately a rather underwhelming film. The film moves slowly and this is made worse by many of the characters who are all pretty dull and their conversations are mostly lifeless and meaningless. Rayburn again had potential to be an interesting character (with him being reformed and having a problem with alcohol which creates an odd character juxtaposition), but nothing is really done with him as a character (he's not developed or explored) and despite him allegedly being a tortured soul of sorts I could never really feel for him as a person. Annabelle Wallis is also quite a bland character with a performance to match (and I know that she can do better if she is given the appropriate opportunity).Aside from a glacial pace and a bunch of bland unintersting characters, the film is also pretty unfocused and seems to be treading along 2 different paths during the middle of the picture (for no particular reason). The direction is lackluster, the script is poor offering no real surprises and the peformances are mediocre (and that's being generous). In spite of the film advertising itself as a thriller, you'd be hard pushed to find many thrills and spills here (although it has its moments which is why I'm not rating it any lower than I have).The Silencing is far from being the worst film in existence, but it's fair to say that it is decidely bland and unremarkable.",The Silencing

17,peterp-450-298716,Can't say it's bad. It's just mediocre.,5,16 September 2020,"I need to see that girl.
She could be my daughter.It's always nice to see how actors from a successful television series cope in a feature film. And especially if the genre is quite different from what they played in that series. Here Nikolaj Coster-Waldau makes a decent attempt to show that he has more to offer than playing a king's son who prefers to perform gymnastic exercises with his sister between the sheets. His performance here is on a similar level to that of Jaime Lannister in ""Game of Thrones"". Convincing enough, but not exactly of exceptional quality. A role that doesn't annoy you. But every time you see his face somewhere, you have to think for a moment where you know that face from. This is also the case here in ""The Silencing"". I was like, ""Damn, where do I know this guy from?"". Only after fifteen minutes or so, I could figure it out.""The Silencing"" itself is of the same level. Certainly not a bad movie. But also not a movie that'll blow you away. The story felt a bit incomplete to me. There were some improbabilities (not to say completely nonsensical decisions). And the denouement with the disclosure of the perpetrator and his motivation, I personally found a bit far-fetched. The film had something ""Silence of the Lambs""-ish but then set in an extensive, forest-like nature reserve. An area managed by Rayborn Swanson (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) that has been given the name ""Gwen Swanson sanctuary"". A reference to his daughter who has been missing for 5 years. It's a place where animals can live undisturbed and protected, far from hunters and poachers. Rayborn lives an isolated life far from the civilized world. A way to silently grief about the loss of his daughter. Usually by consuming liters of alcohol. A bit strange because that's exactly what caused that disappearance.The story gets a little bit more exciting the moment a serial killer comes into the picture. Someone who probably watched ""The Hunt"" too much. What follows, is a cat-and-mouse game with the participation of the local female sheriff Alice Gustafson (Annabelle Wallis, series-loving fans will recognize her from ""Peaky Blinders"") who herself has her hands full with the stupidities her little brother Brooks (Hero Fiennes Tiffin), a drug addict with a traumatic past.Without a doubt, this could have been a much better, coherent movie, provided the script was changed a bit. It's linked together with hooks and eyes. Full of coincidences and ridiculous twists. Decisions are made that are too ridiculous for words. Alice's surprising action at one point is understandable on the one hand. But on the other hand completely unreal. And the indifference that those involved show afterward as if nothing had ever happened, made me frown for a moment. Rayborn's paint pot trick seemed so absurd and stupid that I spontaneously burst out laughing. Not exactly applicable to a serious thriller about a serial killer.""The Silencing"" isn't so great. A mediocre piece of movie. Actually, you could say that you've seen it all before in other movies. And much better movies too. Cinematographically it looks professional (despite the low budget) and the general mood is also good. But, when you love watching exciting flicks with nerve-racking suspense, you'll be disappointed. The only thing I can't say anything wrong about is Nikolaj Coster-Waldau's acting. Solid and constant. Just like in ""Game of Thrones"". Again a pitiful persona. But I'm sure I won't recognize him in his next feature. Once again.More reviews here: movie-freak.be",The Silencing
18,valleyjohn,Scooby Do for Adults,6,14 October 2020,"This is the synopsis found on IMDBA reformed hunter living in isolation on a wildlife sanctuary becomes involved in a deadly game of cat and mouse when he and the local Sheriff set out to track a vicious killer who may have kidnapped his daughter years ago.When I read in a synopsis that someone is involved in a deadly game of cat and mouse Im almost always automatically suspicious. It's a tired , over used description to make a dull film sound exciting and while I wouldn't go as far as to say The Silencing is dull , the synopsis does make it sound better than it is.Nicolaj Coster-Waldau is doing his best to cash in on his popularity after Game Of Thrones and he's not doing a bad job at all. He was great in Shot Caller and has a few films ready to be released in the next twelve months .
He's definitely the best thing about this movie. He's totally believable as the alcoholic father who has lost his daughter, it's just a shame that Annabelle Wallis is totally miscast as the Sheriff.
Caked in make up , she swans around in a police uniform looking totally out of place .The action is few and far between , it's more of a character study than an action movie .
There are many plot holes and unanswered questions in the film but it's probably best not to question the poor decisions of the characters if you are to enjoy this . It's not unlike an adult version of Scooby Do ! You just have to guess who's going to be unmasked as the bad guy .Overall it mildly entertaining as well as lazy at times but it's probably worth watching for Coster-Waldau's performance alone .",The Silencing
19,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of The Silencing,5,24 November 2020,"""She was hunted"". Uh-oh. That can't be good. Hunting is for other stuff which I don't condone, like killing a wild animal for sport or misbehaving like those dudes in 1994's Surviving the Game.Anyway, 2020's The Silencing is my latest review. And yeah, I'm not quite sure what the title of this movie actually entails. I mean there's no silencers involved and well, people get loud and angry. Oh I forgot, there's a scene where a muted persona willingly writes her name in the dirt.Released in July of this year, filmed in the dark-clouded wilderness of Canada, and featuring an ending that does a 180 just for kicks and giggles, ""Silencing"" is helmed by second-time director Robin Pront. Pront divvying a twist or two with a few whip pans, thinks he's channeling his inner Jonathan Demme. In reality, he's just well, channeling.Starring an almost unrecognizable Nikolaj Coster Waldau (in looks and in accent), glorifying spears as murder weapons, and distributed by the busy bee organization that is Saban Films, The Silencing has its characters getting stabbed and shot yet miraculously recovering as they walk around unscathed. I mean it makes sense while being senseless. Otherwise the flick might cease to continue.So yeah, ""Silencing"" kept me involved for at least some of its 90-minute running time. Still, it's over-familiar with stuff like Wind River, Blood and Money, Cold Blood, and 2019's Daughter of the Wolf already making the rounds.The Silencing is about a wildlife sanctuary owner who tries to track a killer bent on preying on young girls. Said owner is an alcoholic, he's got a closed-off personality, and he takes the law into his own hands without so much as a mild indictment. As an avid movie watcher, it's been there and done that for me. ""Tranquilly"" mixed results.",The Silencing

24,NijazBaBs,too unclear and negative,6,26 October 2020,"I hated this movie for being too unclear and negative. The dominant emotion is anger. And leaves us with too many questions unanswered. For example who is that girl on the picture with the culprit (could she be main actor's daughter and still alive), did they find all the bodies especially of main actor's child, why policewoman (sheriff) acted too inapropriately (unreasonably) (even if that is her son, is is still too extreme and unreasonable), why would someone perform surgery on kidnapped children if that is just to save them from drunk parents, what is really wrong with sheriff's kid and what crime has he done and is doing.

26,apryla-58795,Sheriff looks like she just came from a photo shoot,5,30 January 2021,I don't care how good a movie is...when you cast a Botoxed injection filled faced actress in a role like that you loose me. Soooo unrealistic! Annabelle Wallis is only getting roles because she's pretty. She can't act. She's not even interesting. She's bland. Not at all believable that she'd be the sheriff in that one horse backwater town. Nikolaj is of course good and it has been interesting to watch Hero Fienes Tiffin career unfold and the movie did hold my attention BUT again I can only get into a movie so much when they make ridiculous casting decisions. You simply cannot get into a movie when they cast a flawless faced actress in a role that requires someone who would clearly look NOTHING like that. That was a huge misstep and it clearly didn't help the box office numbers. It still failed. Shame on the casting director.Also...no way could he get shot with an arrow...stitch himself up and then the next minute be running around in the woods tracking a killer AND then pick up an approximately 115lb girl and carry her for miles.

34,TwistedContent,The Solid Nikolaj and the Half Realized Script,6,21 July 2020,"It's always interesting to see what the stars of big and beloved shows do after their characters leave (or when the show ends, sometimes in a manner that's anything but beloved... Yes, Benioff and Weiss), so a thriller with Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Game of Thrones) and Annabelle Wallis (Peaky Blinders) was anticipated with intrigue. The setting and plot topped the cake off with a cherry. And so, ""The Silencing"" is quite the decent thriller - never reached the stars and pales considerably in front of its spiritual similars and perhaps inspirations (True Detective, Wind River etc.), but no aspect really in this movie is below the average.Nikolaj portrays Rayburn Swanson, a reformed hunter living in solitude in a wildlife sanctuary, troubled deeply by the disappearance of his daughter years ago. A deadly game of cat and mouse ensues, as he and the town Sheriff Alice (Annabelle Wallis) set out to track down a newly active serial killer who may have also kidnapped Rayburn's daughter. The story provides most of what one would expect, chases, clues, violence, investigative and other misconceptions, offering also some minor plot turns that could raise a couple eyebrows. Though serious and working on heavy themes, ""The Silencing"" lacks suspense and the atmosphere that could've been, as plot largely functions on familiar tropes and leads to a rather clichéd final act. Where the first feature screenplay by Micah Ranum doesn't realize its full potential, the performances, geographical backdrop and visual work tries their best to make up for it. I took some issue with the character of Alice, and Annabelle Wallis didn't have a whole lot to shine on, whereas Nikolaj's offering of Rayburn felt like the most fulfilled character, and acting performance within ""The Silencing"". Shot in Ontario, Canada, ""The Silencing"" utilizes the landscapes and small town's drab charms well, though this backdrop eventually plays a role smaller than I'd wish to see. Cinematography's solid if not exactly impressive, though throughout I was thinking it'd do better with a little less greys in color grading.""The Silencing"" feels lesser than it should've been, but it's never bad or truly boring. Decent, but forgettable, lands in the middle, one of those many movies that feel disappointing for... not being disappointing. Fans of rural thrillers, devious small town shenanigans and serial killer mysteries should be able to find a kick or two in ""The Silencing"". My rating: 6/10.",The Silencing

39,jb_campo,Superb murder thriller,8,13 August 2021,"The Silencing blew me away. The story follows Rayburn, a loner who lives a subsistence life alone by a lake in Minnesota. Apparently, his daughter disappeared years ago and he was driven deep into alcohol to ease the pain. The actor Nikolaj Waldau is incredible. I felt all his desperation and emotion in every moment of this film. Outstanding performance.There are multiple crossover themes in this movie. The loner, a native american land/county with their own law enforcment team, and the county law. Each theme is pushing back and forth against the other to try to get an advantage. Rayburn is divorced on top of his standard pain, and there is a tie to the native american land.The sheriff Alice Gustafson (Annabelle Wallis), is new to the job. She has a brother who has some strong mental issues that she tries to deal with, sometimes pressing the boundaries of the law she is to uphold. That debt against the law plays a key role in the film. Again, very strong acting from Ms Wallis.The direction and cinematography are top notch. The scenes are always somber, rainy, cloudy, no color. Sets the mood perfectly. There are multiple chase scenes that leave your heart pounding - will the person make it? What is going on?The ending is very satisfying and ties it all together in a respectful, believable fashion.The Silencing is an excellent, must-see film that will leave you guessing until the end. Great acting, great story, great cinematography, appropriate music. This movie has it all. Enjoy.",The Silencing
40,Darkjak007,Decent but missing content,6,17 April 2021,"The silencing tells the story of a reformed Hunter named Rayburn(Nikolaj Coster-Waldau)who owns a hunting sanctuary after losing his daughter five years ago. He's become a recluse but as soon as the body of a young girl is found. He confines in the Sheriff(Annabelle Wallis) looking into the case, matters only get worse when he notices on his security cameras young girl being pursued by a camouflage figure. This movie screams your basic premise of Cat and mouse routine but it does have it moments throughout the film but are not consistent. Rayburn characters the highlight of the movie he makes decisions that make you question his actions the whole time falls under the category cliché he pursues to try to chase a stranger off but as soon as he starts shooting and actually wounds him. He doesn't feel it necessary to call the cops. For his daughter being the main focus and drive for him' you really don't know anything about what she was like prior. There's one scene with him and his daughter the way it plays out you don't really buy it, coming to that conclusion. Sheriff Gustafson comes off as if she's going to be an interesting character without spoiling it's just just say that they find a quick way to ruin his character that you are not opened to anything she has to say for the rest of the movie. It doesn't help that for the first 30 minutes This movie feels more of a slow burner you really just get a bunch of scenes of the sheriff going around investigating which doesn't seem realistic because they're like no other cops with her. But it does keep you invested in Rayburn finding his daughter.",The Silencing
41,TuesdayThe17th,Robin Pront's lazily titled mediocre second film is nothing short of generic.,6,1 October 2020,"A title with no meaning. Actors with no oomph. A story we all know. Little to no bloodshed....sounds good, doesn't it?😋 just kidding...
This is actually a very unoriginal film. We have seen this before many time, and have seen it done better. Still though, this is a decent film. The second feature from Robin Pront in no way holds a candle to his first film, ""The Ardennes"" which pretty much looks the exact same as this film, but is much better. Personally I kinda of expected more from Prong considering his first film seemed to have enough grit and rawness to go around with a hefty side of violence. ""The Silencing"" is a let down in the sense that it doesn't provide anything new for us. It doesn't even have any really cool kill scenes. This movie needed more violence and it needed one more death in my opinion to fully achieve the uniqueness that would have brought viewers back for a second viewing a year or two down the road. There is very little to like besides the aesthetic and filters used. The acting is good, not great and the story is sooo recycled. It passes the time but it's just so bland at the same time. For hardened movie fans this film will disappoint but for someone who only watches a movie when they get the chance once every week or two, this movie will probably wow them. Truth is, however, ita very mediocre and that is sad because I was anticipating something hard, gritty, and unforgiving. Waldau is okay but the dude is currently over used in film.

The story is about a reformed hunter and a sheriff who tracks down a murderer. This movie is so good but it could have been great it had so much potential with fascinating characters. The suspense was very weak it felt too controlled for a certain build-up in which never came. I like how it tackles the love between a family and how the lines get blurred to do what might be right. There were many incredible moments and it frustrates me how everything turned into the most expected outcome.The composers Brooke and Will Blair brought fantastic music that defined the town's atmosphere beautifully.What a cast! Annabelle Wallis, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Zahn McClarnon, Hero Fiennes Tiffin, and Melanie Scrofano! Their performances were solid as ever but it left me wanting more as in one of the reasons the film felt incomplete. It gives one a glimpse but then it rushes ever so quickly to track down the murderer without realizing how it skips so many great things about these characters. I was intrigued in the Sheriff's storyline every decision she made got me so engaged with so much of her complexity but sadly along the way it was like they put it aside and that is where the movie got ruined.

From a technical, movie 101 perspective, everything is textbook and it doesn't make any huge mistakes.However, where the movie prevents itself from being very good, is in the following two things:1. Ruins one very good opportunity and turns it into a pointless plot device. Midway through, a discovery is made which raises the stakes tremendously. From that point, the film could have done something very good. But in the end it's rendered useless as the plot jumps onto something else. And the villain emerges with very unconvincing motive.2. It's a carbon-copy of a much better movie called Wind River (2017). I couldn't help but notice the similar look/feel within the first few minutes. The setting, the music and how the story opens was very similar. And much to my disappointment, the borrowing of ideas didn't stop there. The rest of the movie is practically the same.

90,kuner-59029,"Starts strong, but falls apart around the middle",5,27 September 2020,"For the first 30 minutes this film had me glued to the seat. I went in with low expectations, and from the eerie opening shots with a body drifting down a mountain river to the moody lit nature scenes, the tone immediately pulls you in. This is arguably the films strongest point. No gross oversaturation and high contrast steadycam shots to gloss over a non-existant budget, no trying to be cool and flashy or overly slow and pretentious. This film gets the tone right. That's a rarity these days.
The first meeting with the killer really ratchets up the tension. He could be anywhere, and a sense of dread kicks in which lasts right up until the confrontation in the house. They could have done even more here, having the killer keep up the pursuit to really push the sense of omnipresent danger.However, that's when the film falls apart. One of the main characters makes an extremely stupid and unrealistic decision, and the script never regains its footing. From there on out, the main characters make one head scratchingly dumb decision after the next up until an extremely disappointing reveal of who the killer is. One major problem is, that we're never given a list of suspects aside of an obvious red herring, who's plot line fizzles out like so many of the interesting setups from the first half.It's frustrating, because there's so much talent on display. Excellent acting from the leads, good score, great photography, several interesting backstories and conflicts for the main characters, none of which get resolved in a satisfying manner, which makes the plot just feel heavier than it needs to be, and the second half a chore to slog through.As so often, the script is the main problem.

170,henriette-kruger220,The logic is not strong with this one.,3,1 August 2020,"There were so many plot conveniences, unmotivated actions, plain stupid decisions, and even a few blatantly impossible inconsistencies, and unfortunately Nikolaj Coster-Waldau's (admittedly decent) performance can't save it. I was also very disappointed in Annabelle Wallis's performance, as I really liked her in Peaky Blinders. She somehow manages to sound bored while holding a killer at gunpoint.
The film's only other saving grace is the gorgeous scenery.",The Silencing

Bad acting was the least of its problems. Actually, I'm not even sure it was bad acting. Maybe that's just how it seems in a movie full of painfully uninteresting and pointless characters doing painfully uninteresting and pointless things. Sad. It could have been good had they stayed focused even a little to the story it was supposed to be.

183,einar-samuelsson,An iceberg melting too fast,6,21 August 2021,"One of the downsides being used to the multiple episodes format is the frustration over characters ending up flat.

186,dawesy101,A confusing absurd mess,4,20 July 2020,The reviews here are being far too kind. Whilst it has an interesting premise the film just bungles along and has far too many plot holes and characters making absurd choices.The writing is pretty bad and annabelle Wallis' performance is seriously phoned in and at times - just bad. The reveal of the killer is a serious let down and the motive is just not believable at all.The scenery is nice but the cinematography is very uninspired and very low budget looking. Give this one a miss.,The Silencing
187,bigsteve-58945,"Not to bad, was a enjoyable watch",6,18 July 2020,"I love murder mysteries, movies that dont give away the plot to early. So this one was actually good i didnt figure it out to close to the end. The acting was 6/10 and the plot and writing was also a 6/10 thats why i gave it a 6/10 rating. I find that when a story has good character building and it really gives you good background into why things happen in the story.but it wasnt developed enough for me the Sheriff played Alice Gustafson, and the male lead Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as Rayburn Swanson did a great job. Id recommend it for a good watch nothing more then that",The Silencing
188,knightwp,Hunt the writer,5,2 August 2020,"Solid performance from NCW, Annebele was sub-par performance, the script is horrible.
All the build ups were not nothing, the motive of of the killler is laughable. The title silencing, what's the point? Well, they should silence whoever wrote this.
One major downturn of the movie was when the Sheriff thought the suspect was her brother by guessing the guesture he made, without making sure, she shot the guy who caught him. That's one dirty cop! Better yet, she later found out opps it's not her brother and she vowed to catch the killer in front of the seriously injured girl. After all these, the writer would think the audiences are still into the movie?

190,mwaz-33830,Choices have consequences,8,15 August 2021,"I think the thing that made this movie so interesting for me was that it's story was different enough from other crime thrillers that I couldn't say, ""ugh, I've seen this before"". I am not 100% sure where in North America this is meant to have taken place, but it is a small town, lots of beautiful remote wilderness shots. The setting and filming of said locations was very beautiful and definitely added to the film quality. The film is set so that part of the area in question is under the jurisdiction of tribal police and the rest of the jurisdiction is under a sheriff dept. The story is mainly one about choices and their consequences as every choice we make in life has one, be that positive or negative. In this tale we seem to find the trail of bread crumbs working from present to past and back again, allows us to discover the mostly negative consequences of the choices that several of the main character's past coming back to roost. Spoilers follow ****** Nikolaj Coster-Waldau plays the grieving father role quite well here. Ironic that the thing that coincided with his loss is the demon that he chooses as his daily companion. His particular demon is drink. The film makes it clear that the man relies on liquor the way the rest of us rely on water or air. The filmmakers seem to portray this to be a sort of form of self flagellation, after all when his daughter disappeared he was with her and he was more interested in his next drink then her. Enter Annabelle Wallis character. The shiny, young untried sheriff back from the big town of Chicago. Freshly minted degree. Eager to prove herself to her detractors, but she has another purpose driving her, her guilt over leaving behind her troubled younger brother, Brooks. We learn as the film proceeds that after their parents death, she went off to college and he went to foster care, through a few quick scenes setting up Brook's trauma and some newspaper clippings we gather a rather horrific case of abuse followed. Hero Fiennes Tiffin plays Brooks character exceeding well. He may be a supporting roll, but for much of the film you don't know what to make of him. He is troubled and trouble, but how much? From his nail biting to knuckle cracking, to black eyed tight lipped silence, he certainly embued the character of the troubled post adolescent young man. I love Zahn McClarnon in this film. If Annabelle's character is fire, a little wild, guilt ridden, unpredictable and untried, he is the opposite. He is a rock, he has the experience and the character. He plays well the part of a man caught between two worlds. He is calm in the face of menace and rage. As all these charters collide, as their inner demons rage, I just found it very interesting to watch the tale play out. The moment by moment choices of each character. Many of them reacting in the moment. That momentary reaction, that split second choice one that could change the course of their lives forever. Made me think. I have watched this movie three separate times, just because I was invested in the process of that portrayal. In the end this story was less one of redemption and more one of resolution. I guess I found that kinda of interesting too. As humans we always crave the happy ending. We want everything tied up in a neat little bow, but here the writers don't so much give us that. In the end it's about choices and consequences and about how grief and guilt can twist and destroy you, if you let it. Or maybe I just watched this to many times and read too much between the lines?",The Silencing

Movies written by europeans but set in America are always cringe, because the europeans simply do not undestand North American culture, and it is always obvious that the movie is written by someone who has never been to north america, let alone lived there. This movie is almost as bad as that awful Three Billboards movie. Why do people on the left enjoy creating their own villains and narratives to support their political beliefs?

I mean i do not feel anything to the majority of cheracters, which had everything to get at least a small story behind them. Like why someone is drug addicted, what fell parents of kidnapped girls and so on... Rayburn Swanson was told to be always drunk, but we never see it. It appears only as a fact with no circumstances.

The basic idea that various teenage girls go missing in a small town kind of worksbut noone seems overly concerned about it! Why does noone look closely at the removal of voiceboxes and the neat sewing up job? How does the Sheriff not get suspended for shooting an innocent man (who had already been shot with an arrow and been badly beaten up but just keeps on going)? The subplots the Sheriff's dysfunctional family background isn't given enough time for her brother's actions to totally make sense. The chances of Rayburn's 14yr old daughter walking off in the rain seems highly unlikely given that most teenagers refuse to walk anywhere let alone when its shedding it down.
