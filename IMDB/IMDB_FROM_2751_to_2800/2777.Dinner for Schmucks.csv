0,MartinHafer,Would I have hated it less had I not seen the original?,3,27 May 2018,"The French writer/director Francis Veber is one of my favorite filmmakers...with exceptional films like ""The Valet"", ""The Closet"" and ""The Dinner Game"" (among others) to his credit. It's not surprising that Hollywood would want to remake one of his wonderful movies and cash in on his success. Too bad that they didn't trust Veber's wonderful script and changed it so much...dumbing it down in order, they assumed, to get a wider audience to enjoy the story.The basic movies are the same...but they are so very different as well. They both featuring a selfish man inviting who he perceives as a total idiot to a dinner party where all the sophisticated folks dig up the most annoying and stupid folks they can so they can laugh at them. The objects of their laughter THINK they're going to a nice party but there's really nothing nice about the folks running this godawful game. But so much is different beyond that....not just in the storyline but also in the way folks are portrayed. Veber's direction was generally very subtle...and nothing about this American version is subtle and it often chooses the low road instead....ruining, in my opinion, the story. Now I should point out that although the film occasionally irritated me and overall was a bust, my brother-in-law and sister-in-law loved the movie and laughed at many of the parts I hated most. I am NOT saying they are wrong or stupid....but they didn't see the French film and I wonder how much they would have enjoyed ""Dinner for Schmucks"" had they seen it as well. Overall, a huge misfire...and I hope people realize that the original is wonderful and clever.",Dinner for Schmucks
1,TheLittleSongbird,A real dog's dinner of a comedy,1,2 April 2011,"Now don't get me wrong I do like comedy, when it is funny and well-performed it is great. Dinner for Schmucks is not for me the worst comedy ever made or the worst movie ever made, but in my honest opinion it is among the worst of 2010 along with Fred:The Movie, The Other Guys, The Last Airbender and Vampires Suck.Seeing at how good the cast is on paper, Steve Carrell and Paul Rudd are very good with fun material, I really wanted to like Dinner for Schmucks. But there are several reasons why I couldn't even enjoy it. The film does have some decent settings and location work, but I do think the editing could have been a lot tighter, some of it seemed rather rushed.The soundtrack was lacking for me as well. I love a good soundtrack in movies, but the background scoring felt generic for me and the song choices didn't completely fit the film's mood. The direction is poor as well, when it comes to the cinematography it has some odd angles and overall direction wise it felt like too much time was spent on making the leads funny, without succeeding, rather than focusing on a decent story and script.What really brought Dinner for Schmucks down was the story and script. The story is incredibly predictable, with a number of unrealistic and poorly thought out ideas. Also it is poorly paced, I found the first act rather rushed and then as the jokes got stupider the film ground to a halt. The writing is even worse, Dinner for Schmucks has in my view a terrible script that verges more on offensive than funny while the jokes are stupid and some were delivered so fast they went over my head. I didn't like the film's tone either, it went overboard with the craziness and chaos.The acting fares little better. Carrell is talented, and when his material is good he is good too. However his material is pretty much pathetic, so in a valiant attempt to elevate the material Carrell overdoes it and it doesn't help that his character is incredibly annoying. Rudd is the opposite for me, he can be good too, but here he seems bored and underplays his part badly. It is sad as well that the chemistry between the two isn't there either.Overall, a dog's dinner of a comedy. The only redeeming quality really was the mouse art work which was quite enjoyable. 1/10 Bethany Cox",Dinner for Schmucks
2,bkoganbing,He Kind Of Grows On You,7,9 August 2010,"One of the funnier episodes of Married With Children had Kelly Bundy invited to a party for dullards that was throne by the members of a MENSA group. Bud clues her in and they take some action with the other invited dullard guests.That was played strictly for laughs, but Dinner For Schmucks takes the same premise and brings a lot of pathos into the same situation. Steve Carrell plays the invited guest by Paul Rudd to a similar type party being hosted by Rudd's boss Bruce Greenwood. These Yuppies idea of entertainment is for the guests to bring along one oddball character so that they all can be laughed at and the biggest oddball winning some kind of distinction. Like Quasimodo being crowned the King of Fools.Rudd literally runs into Carrell with his car in their meeting, but he remembers the party and cultivates him for a brief spell. Although this is supposed to be of short duration and Carrell drives Rudd out of his mind, he does kind of grow on you.Carrell is funny, but like a lot of comedians of the past like Jerry Lewis, Lou Costello, and even Charlie Chaplin he brings a great deal of pathos into his role. You might even find yourself shedding a tear or two at this gentle, but completely pathetic individual.Among other things Carrell wrecks Rudd's love life with girlfriend, Stephanie Szostak. She's fine in her role, but Lucy Punch as the mad dominatrix who Rudd had a fling with is next to Carrell this best in the film.Dinner For Schmucks is a fine comedy showing off Steve Carrell's talents to full advantage. Catch it while it is still in theaters.",Dinner for Schmucks
3,SnoopyStyle,Fun duo but premise is just a movie excuse,6,13 October 2013,"A lowly 6th floor analyst Tim (Paul Rudd) is invited to a Dinner for Idiots with the boss where everybody has to invite an idiot. He almost refuses when he runs over weirdo Barry (Steve Carell).The premise is really stupid and gets in the way of this funny duo. Paul Rudd and Steve Carell have great chemistry as a really odd couple. I wish they figure out a better way to get these two together. Carell is having a hilarious time especially with crazy Darla (Lucy Punch). Zach Galifianakis is doing another wacky character but isn't quite as successful. He and Carell do this weird thing. It's more sad than funny. This has many uneven moments, but I do love all the mice in the picture boxes.",Dinner for Schmucks
4,claudio_carvalho,And the Idiot does not Know Who Santos Dumont Was....,3,13 January 2011,"The 1998 French comedy ""Le Diner de Cons"" is one of the funniest comedies I have ever seen. The witty theatrical screenplay is intelligent and hilarious and I laughed a lot along the 80 minutes running time.Unfortunately I have decided to see this American remake expecting a funny comedy but the plot is so ridiculous that I did not laugh. The title of this movie should be ""A Film for Schmucks"", and the screenplay writers David Guion and Michael Handelman should have wined the competition in the dinner for schmucks if they were guests for destroying the magnificent storyline. The clumsy character of Steve Carell is extremely annoying, stupid, irritating and never funny and there is no explanation why the clever Tim stays with him after the initial mess with Julie. The poor idiot does not know who Santos Dumont was in his presentation, but what else could I expect from this lame story. The good point is the sweet and beautiful Stephanie Szostak, an unknown actress that shines in this terrible flick. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""Um Jantar Para Idiotas"" (""A Dinner for Idiots"")",Dinner for Schmucks
5,nogodnomasters,I MADE YOU READ THIS,7,23 April 2019,"The movie concept was great. In fact the dinner with the schmucks was very funny, I just wish there had been more of it. Rather than concentrate on what the title of the film would have us believe the movie is about, it takes its time to get there. The movie is about the relationship of Paul Rudd and various people including his gf, ex-gf and Steve Carell, the schmuck he has selected to take to a dinner filled with schmucks. This is a monthly event hosted by his boss.Steve, our schmuck, uses dead mice to make menageries of his life and the history of mankind. He is really a nice guy, who through his stupidity messes up the life of Paul Rudd. The movie makers decided the movie needed a heart warming message that schmucks have feelings too, not thinking that the audience doesn't really care. I think making Paul Rudd attend multiple parties, building up to this one would have been better than the trek these writers took.The movie was funny when it wasn't overly stupid. The reason why we laughed at those Pink Panther movies because there was a sense of possibility in all that stupidity. When you cross that line to no possibility, as this movie sometimes does, it becomes just stupid.Listen carefully to Steve Carell's lines as he mixes up words. ""After sex you curl up and assume a fecal position."" Funny without fart jokes. While the humor is adult, I wouldn't classify it as overly crude.",Dinner for Schmucks
6,kosmasp,Working,7,1 April 2013,"This never should have worked. The premise is evil and why would you root for someone who does something like that? Maybe because Paul Rudd is playing that person that goes wrong and he's so lovable you can't be mad at him. Not to mention that he is put through a lot during the running time of the movie.Actually so much, that you might wonder, why he doesn't stop some things from happening or just reacts another way. But again, it's a slippery slope and it could go any way. The movie does stay on the right side of evil fun most of the time. So it does succeed, which doesn't mean you will automatically like it, of course. Steve Carell is the other guy who makes this happen. If you didn't know Steve from any previous movies, you might think he is that guy he's playing. He's that good at portraying him",Dinner for Schmucks
7,jboothmillard,Dinner for Schmucks,1,13 January 2011,"From director Jay Roach (Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, Meet the Parents), apart from Three Men and a Baby and The Departed, I can't think of many remakes of foreign films that have been made better than the original, and this was another one that wasn't. Basically mid-level financial executive Tim Conrad (Paul Rudd) is successful in his job, and he is pretty sure he has a promotion in the bag, especially with his boss Lance Fender (Bruce Greenwood) inviting to the ""dinner for winners"". He finds out that this dinner has a catch, it is more a ""dinner for idiots"" because he is supposed to bring the most stupid person he can find for the after dinner entertainment, i.e. mocking. The next day he bumps into IRS employee Barry Speck (Steve Carell), with his weird personality, a strange hobby for taxidermy, particularly taking dead mice and turning them into art pieces, or ""miceterpieces"", Tim decides he is the perfect idiot. Soon enough he starts regretting his decision to invite Barry to dinner as he is stalking him, and staying near him causing chaos in his personal life, including mistaking one-night stand from years ago Darla (Lucy Punch) for fiancée Julie (Stephanie Szostak). Tim has the chance to make a good business associate in his boss's colleague, wealthy Swiss businessman Martin Mueller (Little Britain's David Walliams) at lunch, but of course with the Darla-Julie mix-up, this is ruined. After an encounter with Barry's rival, his boss Therman (The Hangover's Zach Galifianakis) with his ""mind control"" powers and who stole his wife, and a bit more chaos, Tim does come clean to his ""friend"" about the whole reason for the dinner. After Barry wins the idiot competition, a big disaster occurs, causing Tim's boss to fire him, and Julie loses her job too, but everything turns out well in the end. Also starring Jemaine Clement as Kieran Vollard, Jeff Dunham as Lewis the Ventriloquist, Ron Livingston as Caldwell and The IT Crowd's Chris O'Dowd as Marco the Blind Swordsman. Rudd seems like he isn't having much fun, just like Sandra Bullock in All About Steve, Carell with his glasses and brushed hair is too freaky and psychopathic to be taken light-heartedly or laugh at, I admit I did like the mouse artwork, but apart from that, this is an appalling and unfunny dog's dinner of a comedy film. Poor!",Dinner for Schmucks
8,paul_haakonsen,This movie will stay with you for a long time...,8,22 December 2010,"I found ""Dinner For Schmucks"" to be quite enjoyable. Why, you ask? Well, the story was quite catching and good, it is the kind of story that grows on you and stays with you for a long time. You have the corporate man wanting to climb the rank ladder (played by Paul Rudd) and the innocent, ignorant ordinary man (played by Steve Carell), coming together and two complete opposite worlds collide.Paul Rudd was quite good in the role of Tim, playing the rules dealt by the corporate ladder, rules that doesn't really sit well with his person, but it takes the interference with someone from another world to make him come to terms with this. And Steve Carell was so amazingly cast for the lovable role as the somewhat slow and gullible Barry who sees the world differently that most others do.But the supporting cast was quite impressive as well, with names like Zach Galifianakis, Bruce Greenwood, and Ron Livingston on the list as well.I loved the way that the movie told the story, and it was really such a great story. I think lots of people could actually see parts of themselves in the Tim character, and I bet most people do not want to admit to having something of Barry to their personality. But those who fully admit to whom they are and are proud of whom they are, are the ones truly happy. And the story told in ""Dinner For Schmucks"" really paints this in a good way.And the whole thing that Barry had going on with the mice, wow. That was beautiful on many levels, especially when you find out why this is his hobby.Honestly, I was really surprised at how much this movie entertained me. It had comedy in good amounts, and I especially loved the brunch scene, I was laughing so hard at that point. And the movie also deals with love and romantic screw-ups in a very good way, and it comes out on the screen so well.This is a movie well worth sitting down to watch, be it by yourself, with your friends, with family, or with a loved one. There is something for everyone in this movie. And anyone who will not find the story touching in even the slightest way, should perhaps take some things in his or her life up to re-evaluation. This movie took me by storm, let it do the same to you.",Dinner for Schmucks
9,Quinoa1984,fools on the hill,5,10 August 2010,"Sometimes, even in comedy, you need to have people that you can sort of, kind of, care about. Even if things get exaggerated, or surreal, the audience shouldn't be looking at their watches or sitting uncomfortably as the obnoxious and strange-for-its-own-sake goes across the screen. Dinner for Schmucks takes off from a French film by Frances Veber, The Dinner Game (which I saw a decade ago and only remember I enjoyed, though not enough to see more than the once in 1999), and has been updated mostly for the sake of giving some more room for locations- originally the Veber film was like a play, set in the guy's house for the dinner- and with lots of comedy actors and so on. It's also helmed by Jay Roach, which is a decent sign of things to come but never a great one (not since the first Austin Powers at least, and that was for Mike Myers comeback).It's the story of the bourgeoisie and the lower-class idiots of the world; watching the film I got the sense it was like a distant, younger relative of Luis Bunuel's style of comedy in attacking the disgusting rich and giving some absurdist praise for the lower rungs of society (think Exterminating Angel with the climax of Viridiana for you fans out there). But it lacks the kind of focus and savage wit that Bunuel had. It's kind of a soft upper-middle class saga of a man, Tim, is after a job on the ""7th floor"" with the other big-wigs, but has to participate in a 'dinner' where everyone brings a 'fool' to make fun of. Enter in a sudden moment of chance (by head-on collision) Barry, a weird little man who works as an IRS analyst by day and makes dioramas of mice by night.Tim has his chance, but what about his girlfriend who is disgusted with the idea and is thinking about leaving him because of it? It's around this point, when Barry shows up again at Tim's place and doesn't leave for nearly the twenty-four hours until the dinner, that the film starts to lose its comedic footing. Early on we meet a supporting character, a creepy but amusingly over-the-top ""arteest"" played by Jemaine Clement, who puts himself really into the work and dons horns and other apparel in his artwork, often with hot-ass girls. He's funny, if a predictable character, and one hopes the film can at least continue in this context. But what comes across at first as a kind of sweet-natured annoyance from Carrel's character just turns to... annoyance, with the occasional mice diorama.The dioramas, in fact, steal the show. They also open the film in a striking credits sequence of various mice set up in designs and clothes and backdrops to the Beatles ""Fool on the Hill"". It's a beautiful, absurd little number, and it barely reaches that authentic whimsy and fun again. Scene after scene, Barry keeps poking his head in Tim's business, or his business affairs (i.e. trying to sweet-talk a Swiss man to go with the money firm or whatever), and while the point is mostly clear- that annoying idiots still have hearts to and can be endearing- it's muddled by a) it not often being funny, and compounded in unfunny stature with the appearance of a stalker-of-Tim's who is even WORSE than Barry, and b) a lack of focus as the plot continues to its inevitable climax. Even supporting players that *should* be dynamite like Zach Galifinakis fall flat under the strain of over-awkward comedy.As I mentioned, Bunuel could have done wonders with this sort of material. It mixes social satire and the genuine bizarre people of the world together, and it should be funnier. Should being the operating word; sometimes it IS quite funny, mostly due to Clement or the occasional aside from Rudd or Carrel. But the climax is overstuffed with predictability and snide commentary. Somehow director Roach sees a lot of this as believable in its situation to situation, but it isn't. Why would Tim go so far with this guy? There's an underlying nastiness to the movie too, and it's sometimes hard to pinpoint until one sees it, and it's in the guise of a sweet-but-bizarre comedy of manners. Again, the mice- especially mouse Vincent Van Gogh and Ben Franklin- steal the show. I would just turn it on for those scenes, or maybe some of Clement's scene-stealers. It's mostly a disappointment of tone and obnoxious tendencies.",Dinner for Schmucks
10,tavm,Steve Carell and Paul Rudd make another good teaming in Dinner for Schmucks,7,2 August 2010,"Okay, Dinner for Schmucks is a comedy with overtones of schmaltz, slapstick, and silliness that somehow is mostly very enjoyable in spite of itself. Certainly the reteaming of straight man Paul Rudd and eccentric Steve Carell makes the whole thing go down pretty easy even during the more cringeworthy parts. And they're surrounded by some other wonderfully crazy characters like Zach Galifianakis as an I.R.S. man who's sleeping with Carell's ex-wife, Jemaine Clement as an artist named Kieran, or Lucy Punch as Rudd's stalker Darla. Throw in Bruce Greenwood as Rudd's boss, David Walliams as potential client Fender Mueller, and Stephanie Szostak as Rudd's potential fiancée Julie and the whole thing has enough humor and heart to make this one of the most enjoyable comedies this season. Director Jay Roach of the Austin Powers and the Focker comedies lets things get a little wild before settling to a more sentimental climax that doesn't get too cloying. Certainly the use of The Beatles' ""The Fool on the Hill"" contributes to the feel-good vibe felt throughout...",Dinner for Schmucks
11,jotix100,Dinner with idiots,3,2 December 2011,"What genius in Hollywood thought he could improve on an original French film that stands by itself, which in addition, was witty and funny? Judging by other 'adaptations' for movies that originated in France, the odds for 'Dinner for Schmucks' to succeed as a good comedy were nil, at best. This was a project that might have appeared to being ripe for the trans Atlantic voyage, but alas, something happened before it landed in L.A.This was obviously a Steve Carell's vehicle. After all, he was going to play the schmuck in the film. From all his films, we thought this must have been his worst appearance. Mr. Carell has done much better, something that unfortunately does not happen under the direction of Jay Roach, a man identified with the Fockers and Austin Powers sagas. The problem seems to be the screenplay written by David Guion and Michael Handelman. It is over plotted and over long. In comparison, the original ""Le diner de cons"", created by Francis Veber looks like a masterpiece.The best thing in the film is Paul Rudd, playing the straight man, to Mr. Carell's goofy, mice loving guy. Mr. Rudd is an impeccable actor who always manages to shine in whatever he is asked to play. The side story of Kieran, as played by Jemaine Clement and the IRS inspector of Zach Galifianakis, just do not make it because both characters are phonies. Lucy Punch has some good moments as the woman infatuated with Tim. Kristen Schaal casts a nice presence as well as the beautiful Stephanie Szostak, who plays Julie. Bruce Greenwood, a serious actor, had the misfortune to play the mean boss giving the party for the 'schmucks'.",Dinner for Schmucks
12,zardoz-13,What A Travesty!!!,2,3 August 2010,"""Austin Powers"" director Jay Roach serves up a less than appetizing rehash of French director Francis Veber's 1998 comic masterpiece ""The Dinner Game."" ""Dinner for Schmucks"" casts Paul Rudd cast as the straight man, while Steve Carell hams it up as a dim-witted idiot. Rudd and Carell have now co-starred in three comedies. Previously, they appeared together in ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy."" No, ""Dinner for Schmucks"" isn't half as hilarious as either ""40-Year-Old Virgin"" or ""Anchorman."" The premise of this half-baked hokum is that our hero's arrogant boss throws a once-a-month dinner party where his best and brightest employees compete to see who can bring the dumbest dinner guest. Typically, the dinner guests are such incredible imbeciles that they don't realize that they are being roasted instead of toasted. Essentially, these cold-blooded bigwigs at a private equity firm that cuts up other firms and sells off their assets need something for a good laugh. Unfortunately, ""Dinner for Schmucks"" comes up short on yucks. This politically incorrect plate of pabulum concerns an ambitious, young analyst who is prepared to sell his soul to the Philistines so he can realize his dreams, specifically marrying his girlfriend. Along the way, our hero realizes the error of ridiculing idiots so that he can attain his dreams. Long before he grasps what he has done, the humor in ""Dinner for Schmucks"" has lost its seasoning. The original French comedy concluded before the eponymous dinner. ""Dinner for Schmucks,"" however, goes in for a seven course meal and wears out its welcome. Mind you, it is always a pleasure to watch Carell cutting up, and he seems to be genuinely having fun as an IRS processor and mouse taxidermist who assembles the dead rodents in detailed dioramas. Incidentally, designer Joel Venti and the cult effects Chiodo brothers, Charles, Edward and Stephen , who fashioned the puppets for ""Team America: World Police,"" whipped up these inventive dioramas. The point is that Carell steals the show, but the show really isn't worth stealing. When Carell isn't carrying on his shtick, ""Dinner for Schmucks"" sucks.Financial analyst Tim (Paul Rudd of ""Sidekicks"") has been pestering his cute girlfriend Julie (Stephanie Szostak of ""The Devil Wears Prada"") to marry him, but she is a career girl who orchestrates elaborate art deals. Meanwhile, Tim lives in an elegant apartment and drives an expensive sports car that he really cannot afford. After the president of Tim's firm, Lance Fender (Bruce Greenwood of ""Star Trek""), pink-slips an executive who took the business down the wrong path, Tim angles for the promotion. Tim concocts a scheme to bring a fabulously wealthy Swiss entrepreneur, Mueller (David Walliams of ""Stardust""), to Fender Finances. Mueller owns a munitions firm with tons of leftover ordinance from World War I, basically bombs, and Tim has figured out a way to convert the bombs into lamps. Of course, Fender Finances will take a bath marketing the bomb lamps, but they will clean up managing Mueller's portfolio. Fender is desperately looking for ideas to turn his company around when Tim pitches his proposal. Initially, Fender wants to hand the project over to one of his surefire executives, but he finds Tim's blind ambition so refreshing that he lets him woo Mueller. Fender tells our hero about his super-secret party and invites him to bring the biggest boob. It doesn't take Julie long to convince Tim that the dinner is a dumb idea. Nevertheless, Tim needs that promotion so desperately so he can sweep Julie off her feet that he sets out to find a loser.Literally, Tim runs into a loser. Barry (Steve Carell) is picking up a dead mouse for his mice diorama when Tim hits him. Fortunately, Barry is none the worse for landing on Tim's hood and then being hurled several feet away. Initially, Tim fears the worst when Barry and he try to reach a monetary agreement, until Tim realizes that Barry plans to pay him for the damage to his sports car. After Tim breathes a sigh of relief, he asks Barry what he was doing in the middle of the street. Barry shows Tim a dead mouse that he was trying to retrieve from the street before our hero could flatten it with his care. Barry flaunts a book that contains photographs of the dead mice after he has dressed them up to resemble famous paintings, such as Whistler's mother. Tim knows a good thing when he sees it and cultivates Barry's friendship. Meantime, after Julie gets wind of what Tim plans to do, she wants to break up and devote herself to her latest insane art client, Kieran (Jemaine Clement of ""Gentlemen Broncos""), whose art works of himself dressed up in a satyr costume are selling like crazy. As nutty as Barry is, Barry stands no chance alongside the warped, egotistical genius of Kieran. Predictably, Tim learns his lesson, and Barry and he show up Fender for the snobbish ape that he really is. However, before Barry can win the trophy as the biggest idiot, he must confront his intimidating IRS co-worker, Therman (Zach Galifianakis of ""The Hangover""), another hopeless moron who constantly overshadows Barry.Incongruity is the source of the best comedy. The buffoons that Steve Carell, Jemaine Clement, and Zach Galifianakis play in ""Dinner for Schmucks"" are as funny as this labored comedy gets. What makes these performances work so well is that the actors appear to have no idea how ridiculous they look. Carell looks like he is channeling the comic actor Austin Pendleton of ""My Cousin Vinny"" with his spectacles, buck-teeth, and wacky haircut that makes him look particularly nerdy. Jemaine Clement scores points for ""Dinner"" as an eccentric artist obsessed with all things goat, and Zach Galifianakis never misses a chance to make himself look hopelessly cretinous. Despite its interesting characters, ""Dinner for Schmucks"" belongs in a richly deserved doggie bag, but not as a treat.",Dinner for Schmucks
13,george.schmidt,Comedic blend of Apatow heart/Farrelly Bros' instincts & LaBute underpinings; hysterically funny - Rudd & Carell make an inspired odd couple,9,5 August 2010,"DINNER FOR SCHMUCKS (2010) ***1/2 Steve Carell, Paul Rudd, Zach Galifianakis, Jemaine Clement, Stephanie Szotstak, Lucy Punch, Bruce Greenwood, David Walliams, Ron Livingston, Larry Wilmore, Kristen Schaal, PJ Byrne, Andrea Savage, Lucy Davenport, Chris O'Dowd, Jeff Dunham, Octavia Spencer, Rick Overton, Patrick Fischler.

What comes across as a hyper blend of Apatow heartwarming gross out comedy with Farrelly Brothers' instincts and an undercoating of bilious Neil LaBute, the film runs on all comedy cylinders with no holds-barred with some truly hilarious bits (namely Rudd attempting to coerce his fiancée Szotstak away from pompous ass 'artist' Clement who nearly steals the movie) and a few genuine sequences of emotional breakdowns (namely Carell's nemesis IRS colleague Galifianakis and his 'hypnotic mind puppetery'!)

14,ferguson-6,Fool on the Hill,5,31 July 2010,"Greetings again from the darkness. I fully expected this to be an all-out raunch-com in the vein of ""The Hangover"", and I was absolutely mistaken. The film only slips into slapstick and physical punchlines at the lowest part of the actual dinner. The rest of the movie is pretty basic and set near real life.Often, real life situations bring the most humor. Sadly, that's not the case here. Most of this one is just plain boring. There are some very talented people associated with this one and they all do a fine job. It's just that the pieces don't make up a whole. The film basically rides on the shoulders of the talented Steve Carell as Barry. Barry is a genuinely nice guy whose wife left him for his boss (Zach Galfianakis), and his hobby is making intricate displays of dressed up dead mice ... his ""mouseterpieces"", he calls them.Paul Rudd plays Tim, another genuinely nice trying very hard to make it in the business world. He has the right car and a great apartment and a beautiful girlfriend (Stephanie Szostack) who doesn't think it's time for them to be married. Tim seizes an opportunity at work to go for a promotion. This gets him invited to his boss's monthly dinner party where all the managers bring a guest with extraordinary skills ... the schmucks of the title. The point is to have a good laugh at the expense of the idiots. Obviously Tim runs into Barry and guest list is complete.Tim explains to his girlfriend that there is a ""me you don't know"" who has to do things in order to get ahead at work. I really wanted to see more of THAT guy! Instead, we are subjected to another film that just doesn't know how to take advantage of Paul Rudd's talent. He is a funny guy and you would never know it here.If not for Steve Carell and an outlandish performance by Jemaine Clement (Flight of the Conchords) as an ""artist"", this film would be totally flat. Instead, there are a few laughs and an underlying theme about the sweetness of some people. It tries to ask the question, who are the real schmucks? Director Jay Roach is responsible for the Austin Powers and the Meet the Parents franchises. He obviously knows humor. He takes this one from a French film directed by Francis Veber called ""The Dinner Game"". In that film, we never actually get to the dinner. In this one, the film sinks to its lowest point during the dinner. Lesson learned. Best part? Hearing the Beatles during the opening and closing credits.",Dinner for Schmucks
15,anaconda-40658,Dinner for Carell.,9,19 August 2015,"Dinner for Schmucks (2010): Dir: Jay Roach / Cast: Steve Carell, Paul Rudd, Jemaine Clement, Zach Galifianakis, Lucy Punch: Hilarious comedy not so much about idiots, but about those making such accusations. Paul Rudd wishes to move ahead in his job but first he must attend an annual dinner where he must bring an idiot for the amusement of the guests. He encounters Steve Carell who dresses up dead mice for scenery pieces. One of director Jay Roach's best and funniest. He previously introduced the world to the antics of Austin Powers. Carell is a hoot as the unpredictable nerd who lives to laugh but often causes havoc. Part of this is in no due part to his e-mail response on Rudd's computer to an intimidating ex-girlfriend. What Carell teaches us here is done in form by accepting who he is and whom others believe he is and running with it because in the end, he is the one who laughs loudest. Rudd is very good and a terrific foil to Carell's antics but his concluding decision is obvious. Among unique supporting players is Jemaine Clement, an exhibitionist laying claim to Rudd's girlfriend, and Zach Galifianakis as a corrupt hypnotist who will meet his match in a very strange way at the dinner. Lucy Punch is funny in a brief but pivotal scene as Rudd's stalking ex-girlfriend whom Carell makes contact with, resulting in brawl. This dinner is complete with a variety of strange looking characters that are suppose to be the brunt of a joke but we are left admiring their creative get-ups and egos. Very creative and unique comedy about judging others, and other such appetizers. Score: 9 / 10",Dinner for Schmucks
16,Sylviastel,Funny at Times! Faithful to the Original French Version to some degree!,7,15 August 2010,"Steve Carell really shows his comedic range in this film. You can't help but like Barry, the IRS taxidermist, who was hit by Tim's car as he was collecting a dead mouse off the street in Los Angeles. Tim is played brilliantly by Paul Rudd. Tim is a businessman who wants to get promoted and hopefully engaged to Julie, his live-in girlfriend who is an art museum curator. At the moment, she is representing Kieran Vollard who has some pretty weird taste in his artistic endeavors. Anyway, Tim meets Barry and his life changes for the worse or the better depending upon how you look at it. Both men have more in common than they realize. Barry's wife leaves him for his boss, Thurman, who becomes a guest at the infamous dinner for idiots. While Barry thinks the other guests are remarkable, Tim knows the real reason that they're all there. I like this film and I think the director didn't go too far into the ridiculous as he could have done. In fact, the film has a lot less vulgarity in language and even sexual relations although there is some sexuality especially with Kieran. I expected sick jokes at times but I found the humor to be mild and tame and they told the story of an unusual friendship. The original French version ended differently but I wanted Tim to make the same revelation that he's the biggest idiot and maybe we all are. It's funny how two different people like Tim and Barry can become friends who did need each other and learned from each other.",Dinner for Schmucks
17,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Dinner for Schmucks,7,10 October 2010,"Based upon the film Le Diner de Cons, Dinner for Schmucks is the Hollywood remake directed by Jay Roach, who is better known for being at the helm of films such as the Austin Powers trilogy, and Meet the Parents/Fockers, all of which are some of my favourite comedies. Dinner for Schmucks however isn't that laugh a minute forgettable flick, but rather is a more sombre tale to remind us of the little guy that's always around, easy to tread on and bullied by the high and mighty.Paul Rudd stars as Tim, an analyst who is dreaming of moving upwards in his company's corporate ladder. He gets the attention of CEO Lance Fender (Bruce Greenwood) through a rather brash stand out moment during a meeting, and is given that 5 minute elevator pitch to join the firm's head honchos in a dinner where he would be welcomed into the fold if he can meet their expectations - that is to bring along an idiot as his dinner guest, and they were all to laugh at him. The objective is secret of course, and everyone will bring someone in a competition of sorts. It's unorthodox and reeks of elitism, but desperate to get that cushy job, he goes against the wishes of his girlfriend Julie (Stephanie Szostak) and fate allows him to bump into Barry (Steve Carell), a simpleton taxidermist who works on mice.As you can predict, much of the comedy comes at the expense of Barry, who speaks funny, behaves oddly, and most of the time you wonder if you're guilty of the same if you were to laugh at him and his antics. It's evil that we get to laugh at someone who's most unfortunate and naive, but that's how David Guion and Michael Handelman's story sets it out to be, with Barry being the fall guy at the receiving end of the butt of the jokes, while Tim slowly undergoes a painful lesson the ill intentions go through a karmic circle as we see his life turn upside down where misfortunes become lucky escapes which in turn sets itself up for a bigger fall.Steve Carell is a great comedian, and like his Maxwell Smart in Get Smart, his Barry here is loony with a capital L, who lives life in his own cocoon which I suspect had snapped when his wife cheated on him with his boss Therman (Zach Galifianakis), who claims to possess the power to read minds since he works in the tax bureau and can see through guys hiding something. The major scene played in the office is nothing but insane and frankly, idiotic, but sets itself up nicely for the big mano a mano in the last act, which unfortunately came across as a little stretched. Thanks to Carell's presence, he brings to life a comedy of disastrous situations though it's still a little bit unnerving to consciously know you're laughing at someone's misfortune.With the strong underlying message of what friendship means and how we learn to accept the drawbacks of our friends, Paul Rudd stars in his second bromance after I Love You Man to explore just that, but it's Jemaine Clement (from Flight of the Conchords) who steals the show as Kieran the artist who's so full of himself and pretentious. Now that is something I can wholeheartedly laugh at!",Dinner for Schmucks
18,StevePulaski,A Comedy Afriad of It's Own Shadow,7,4 August 2010,"The 2010 year, the start of a new decade, has not delivered too many laugh out loud, hilarious Comedies, at least none that I've seen. The only Comedy I think I've liked this year is She's Out of My League honestly. This movie had a good cast of people, cameos and leads. Still, from the trailers and the reception, I had full expectations that this would be a funny movie, not living up to The Hangover in terms of jokes, but at least an above average film. What I got was a mix of some good laughs, some flop jokes, and scenes that dragged on way too long.The plot is a hard one to explain, Tim (Rudd) is a hardworked, up-tight business man who is empowered to sell model lamps to his boss Mueller. Not to mention he has a girlfriend Julie (Szostak) who is getting a curator deal for a friend named Keiran (Clement). After being invited to a dinner when surprising everyone with the unexpected lamp surprise, Tim learns from his boss that he has to find an idiot to bring to the dinner and if the idiot is chosen as the stupidest he'll win an award and get the job. So its more of a mockery rather than a true honor. When Tim hits Barry (Carell) with his car by accident, they become closely acquainted, but since Barry jabbers on and on and basically makes an idiot out of himself while simultaneously ruining Tim's life, he believes that he can use Barry in the dinner and hopefully get his lamps selling. Barry also has an obsession with dead mice, making them into nic-nacs after cleaning them up and practically having a whole mice world in his basement.The Comedy is slow for the first half of the movie, but picks up real fast once Barry is introduced. I can say a lot much about this movie, for instance, we all have the ""Barry"" character in our lives. Someone who is too nice and someone who tries to help out while at the same time destroying your life. Schmucks also has jokes that are sometimes laugh out loud ones, sometimes they fall very flap, and some small grins. This movie is almost afraid to go to far which is to blame because of the PG-13 rating. If this had an R rating we could have gotten more out of the characters. A possible vulgar outburst from Barry, a very loud fight with Julie and Tim, a lot of scenes could have been added to make this film funnier if it wasn't cut back to PG-13. Also, its noticeable that the jokes are recycled, but used as if they are fresher than when they were first used. But jokes that are as if they are new come very rarely.It also includes one of my favorite songs for a brief eight seconds. You guessed it's ""Escape (The Pina Colada Song)"" by Rupert Holmes. It was used in Grown Ups as well and The Sweetest Thing. It made me smile when I heard it and I believe it gave a more open mind about what to expect.The movie also tends to drag on way too long. This movie is fit for a ninety minute runtime. No need to exaggerate the plot to 114 minutes. Most scenes featuring Rudd/Carell go on a while since the character Barry needs seem like a slow-witted person. The whole movie focuses on a dinner that doesn't happen until the very end. It should have just been called Meet the Schmucks or just plain Schmucks. Or if you want to be real corny, Whatta Buncha Schmucks! fits well.The movie all in all isn't new, but it acts as if it is. There are cool scenes of the mice dioramas made by Barry which is probably one of the top qualities about this film. The pros revolve around Rudd/Carell being great together, some huge laughs, a fine overall plot, Jeff Dunham's cameo is excellent and unexpected as well as the return of Office Space star, Ron Livingston, whos cameo is great too, and semi-believable characters. The cons are its overly long, Barry's approach is tedious at times, the plots recycled, Zach Galifianakis's cameo is too dumb to believe, and a trimmed rating. Its good in my book, but it could be better.Starring: Steve Carell, Paul Rudd, Zach Galifianakis, Jemaine Clement, Jeff Dunham, Bruce Greenwood, Ron Livingston, and Kristen Schaal. Directed by: Jay Roach.",Dinner for Schmucks
19,KineticSeoul,Well it ain't the one of the worst comedy I seen...,4,6 August 2010,"Well it was better than the trailers to some degree, but that isn't saying much. Now I like Steve Carell and Paul Rudd in some of there movies, and they try to do what they do best. Except Steve Carell plays a real psycho in his new role, don't know any other roles where he plays a retarded psycho. Anyways the premise is about Barry played by Steve Carell who collects dead mice and makes a model of them and also screws up Paul Rudd's character's life piece by piece. Although Tim(Paul Rudd) tries to use Barry in the beginning, I couldn't help but notice how much of a saint he is in this film. I mean he doesn't go as far as some people would go to get a promotion, and even though his life gets screwed apart he keeps his cool for the most part. Now the premise of a idiot constantly messing up someone's life has been done before, but in this it all seems way too intentional. Like Barry is trying to screw it up intentionally which takes the sympathy out of his character, even when it talks about his somewhat sad background. Now I found some parts sort of funny and got a few chuckle out of it, unlike some of the skateboard kids that were sitting behind me in the theaters. They were constantly cracking up going ""OMG"" and laughing like it's the funniest movie ever. It really isn't and as a whole, the film is a mess, in a negative way. It basically insult both the so called fools and the corporate people at the same time.4.5/10",Dinner for Schmucks
20,Hellmant,An insult to creative outcasts and individuals everywhere!,5,14 September 2010,"'DINNER FOR SCHMUCKS': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Jay Roach, director of both the 'MEET THE PARENTS' and 'AUSTIN POWERS' franchises, directs this remake of the French 1998 film 'THE DINNER GAME'. It's co-scripted by David Guion and Michael Handelman (who also wrote 'THE EX') and stars Steve Carell and Paul Rudd (who apparently can only co-star in buddy films). It's also highlighted by memorable co-starring performances from Zach Galifianakis, Ron Livingston, Bruce Greenwood and Stephanie Szostak (who bares a striking resemblance to a younger Julia Ormond and is just as beautiful and talented, all though her part is a little weak and annoying here). Even with all that talent the film still flounders; all though hilarious at times it's way too ridiculous and mean spirited as well.I've never seen the original but I've gathered, from reading about it, that this is a somewhat loose remake. It revolves around Tim (Rudd) an exec desperately looking for advancement at his business in order to impress his girlfriend (Szostak) who he continually asks to marry him, and even carries around a ring for. When given the chance of a promotion, through the firing of another employee, Tim jumps at the chance to impress his bosses. He learns that this includes attending a dinner in which employees pride themselves in bringing the biggest idiot they can find, to mock and make fun of for the enjoyment of others. His conscious and his girlfriend are dead set against this but when he meets Barry (Carell) he can't resist the opportunity. Barry is a sweet heart-ed but naive and sheltered buffoon who prides himself by making art displays out of dead mice, which he uses his taxidermy skills on. The movie pretty much writes itself from there.Parts of the movie are laugh out loud hilarious thanks to impressive performances, writing and directing but other parts are appalling thanks to performances, writing and directing. The concept itself is brilliant, which I'm guessing the original film is as well, but this remake is way too over the top and unbelievable as well as just ugly and mean spirited. It pretends to be in good will and have a small heart at times but really it's an insult to creative outcasts and individuals everywhere. The 'loveable losers' presented in this movie are shown as annoying and idiotic pests on normal citizens who we should love because they mean well. It's really patronizing and insulting to anyone who dares to step outside of the norm, although it briefly pretends to be otherwise. The movie is not realistic in any way and does make several jokes at the expense of others, just like the majority of it's characters. Movies like 'THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN', 'PLANES, TRAINS & AUTOMOBILES' and the more recent 'SHE'S OUT OF MY LEAGUE' represent a more heartfelt and sincere example of similar subject matter. The movie is really funny at times but it really leaves a bad taste in your mouth after-wards. Some people, like many of the characters and film makers of this movie, think it makes them look clever and smart to make fun of others but that's really easy and anyone can do it. Some of us just choose not to.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YDpWRaEnYQ",Dinner for Schmucks

22,ElMaruecan82,Only the beginning and ending of the film redeem the one-hour mess that goes in-between ...,6,12 April 2013,"I remember when I heard that ""The Dinner Game"", one of the greatest French comedies ever written, was going to be remade in America, my initial reaction was ""Not again!"" or ""Haven't they learned the lesson?"" Of all the Francis Veber's movies that got the remake-treatment, none inspired a remake worthy of comparison, and the remakes immediately sunk into oblivion. Who remembers now ""The Man with One Red Shoe"", ""Pure Luck"" or ""Father's Day""? Not Jay Roach apparently, who directed ""Dinner for Schmucks"" with Steve Carrell playing the role of the late Jacques Villeret and Paul Rudd as the obligatory straight man.The casting was promising though, and the film deserved at least to be given the benefit of the doubt. However, my first glance at the movie poster confirmed my initial fears: Carrell looked too dumb, and I knew the Americans would get the meaning of 'cons' (the titular insult in the original comedy) totally wrong. Villeret played a 'con' as a lovable buffoon who, despite all his efforts to help and make up for his mistakes, was generating one disaster after another. He was still a 'normal' man, one you got to talk to a few minutes before realizing how idiotic he is. ""Dinner for Schmucks"" goes straight to the point, an idiot has to look idiot, in case people wouldn't notice a man collecting dead mouses to recreate famous paintings or historical scenes would be mentally challenged.The problem is that the initial premise of the film was deliberately cruel (a group of rich snobs inviting a fool to vote for the most idiotic one) but it made the series of incidents punctuating the narrative even more rewarding, we wanted the rich villain to get his comeuppance, as no decent person would laugh at people mocking other people. In ""Dinner for Schmucks"", Carrel looks crazy, stupid, in fact, he doesn't need to do anything to make you laugh, he's already a comical character. I thought there would be a thin line between French and American sophistication, it was not even a gap, it was a ravine. Therefore, we laugh at Carrell too, we laugh at his stupidity and craziness, and it's Paul Rudd we feel sorry for. The roles are reversed and it's almost painful to see Rudd going through this nightmare since he didn't even want to be involved in the dinner (contrarily to his French alter-ego who was a cocky bastard).The problem with ""The Dinner Game"" is to over-exploit the idiocy of the main character at a point you wonder whether he is a moron or a retarded person, and to make things worse, the characters who were supposed to behave normally in the French version, are all parodied to the worst, the mistress is a slutty and pervert nymphomaniac, the IRS colleague another idiot in a more psychic level, and don't get me started on all the other 'idiots' invited for the dinner. I wanted to feel sorry for them, but the film insists so much on their 'peculiarity' that the only feeling that clearly came to me was pity. However, it would be a lie to say that none of these character made me laugh, but while the French version's gags mostly relied on comedy-of-errors, verbal humor and confusion, ""Dinner for Schmucks"" contained too much slapstick and gross gags to make you focus on the more subtle parts, and to the heart of the story, which was the friendship and understanding growing between Rudd and Carrell. Yes, because despite my criticism, the film had its moments and some of them touched me.""Dinner for Schmucks"" had a great potential, something that could have elevated it to the same level of poignancy and tenderness than ""40-Year Old Virgin"", even more because Carrel's character had a sweet side, expressed through his passion. Paul Rudd played his part perfectly, even better than Lhermitte, and interestingly, the film developed the dinner's concept more than the original. The first part in the company is cleverly written and made me expect a much more mature humor, the relationship with his fiancé provided the perfect dosage of romance. But the ""Dinner"" was too great a concept not to be filled by visual gags, the French version focused on the interactions between the two leads, the second one knew it had to be a warmer tone, less cynical, but while the intentions were good, the means are debatable.As a result, the film both starts and ends in a very positive way, and the mess that goes in-between is only redeemed by the whole tenderness still inhabiting the story. I confess that some gags really made me laugh, a psychological struggle with the telephone and the reaction of Carrel made me burst out laughter, but one or two gags perfectly delivered is still better than a series of gags begging for laughs. From the Gothic animal-lover artist, to the women who talked to dead animals, the movie plunged us in an ocean of absurdity and surrealism that killed off all the charm.I ended the French film's review by this sentence ""just because someone looks and sounds like a fool doesn't mean he's not one"", and this was referring to the ending of the film which was a strike of genius in terms of comical writing and a perfect conclusion. In ""Dinner for Schmucks"" , we already know that, there isn't much left to surprise you at the end  to take you totally off-guard, as if the script wasted so much energy in its avalanche of gags, that it was already out of breath at the end, and could only distribute the obligatory conclusions we all expected. A pity because the film had a great potential.",Dinner for Schmucks
23,g-bodyl,Quite Funny!,9,20 October 2013,"Dinner for Schmucks is actually a pleasant surprise and quite funny. Based off the trailers I have seen, this movie looked like tripe. Apparently many people did think this movie was tripe, but not me. I thought it was good idea for Paul Rudd and Steve Carell to team up because they are a funny pair and their chemistry proves it. This movie has some funny jokes but it has a heart and you feel for the main characters.Jay Roach's film is about a rising executive who realizes that the only way to get a promotion at his job is to find the biggest buffoon out there and invite him to his boss's dinner so he could win the promotion.This film has a talented cast led by the excellent Paul Rudd and Steve Carell. It's nice of them to use their talents to face off against each other. The supporting cast is great with such likes as Bruce Greenwood, Lucy Punch, Jeff Dunham, and of course the scene-stealing Zach Galifinakis.Overall, this is a pretty funny movie that has some solid jokes. This is way better than I have expected and the last half hour of the film is definitely the best. This is worth seeing just for Rudd and Carell. I rate this film 9/10.",Dinner for Schmucks

She is a budding art museum curator and, although she seems to love him, she won't put the ring on her finger that Paul constantly takes out of his pocket. To help his case, Tim is trying hard to climb his investment firm's ladder and, in fact, comes up with a brilliant idea to lure a wealthy Swiss man into becoming a client. The head honcho (Bruce Greenwood) is pleased. However, to ensure that Tim has the right stuff, the bossman lets Tim know that his relevance at an upcoming dinner party will be critical. Each member of the company that attends must bring a ""schmuck"", a loser, to the event. The person whose guest is the ""worst"" will snare a trophy AND be a top dog at work. When Tim tells Julie of the dinner, she is appalled and asks that Tim not do such a despicable thing. Unfortunately, a prime candidate, Barry (Steve Carell) literally runs in front of Tim's car and falls to the ground. This IRS employee is earnest but dimwitted and makes dead mouse dioramas in his spare time. Hanging out for a day or two together, Barry messes up Tim's life in a big way. A psycho ex-girlfriend of Tim's comes calling, thanks to Barry's Internet invitation, and Julie, getting caught in the fray that follows, bolts out the door and into the arms of a client. Eventually, there is nothing for Tim to do but take Barry to the dinner. Will Tim win the competition but, more importantly, will Julie come back to him and will Barry be hurt by the dinner's raison d'etre? Based on a French film, this American translation lacks something, being very uneven. Sometimes its very funny and other times, the jokes fall flat. But, the cast is wonderful and the movie's best asset. Carell and Rudd are a great duo, like Abbott and Costello, and Zach Galifianakis, Greenwood, Szostak, Ron Livingston, and all of the others truly ""make"" the film a success. That said, the settings are also very fine, with Rudd's apartment absolutely stunning in its decor. Costumes, too, are well-selected and the camera work is also nice. As stated above, however, the script and direction are on again, off again, making for a wee bit of disappointment in the overall final picture.

It's hard to imagine what the movie would have been like with out Rudd and Carell but I'm guessing not as good. This part seems written for Carell, he plays it perfectly and it is his funniest role since Brick in ""Anchorman"". The one downfall of the movie is that it is entirely predictable (most comedies are), but it is still a fun ride till the end.

And oddly enough, through the climax of the film I was somehow reminded of Beetlejuice, although I don't know why...something about the particular sense of humor used through the films.Steve Carrel does have some good moments when he makes his character very sympathetic. He really is a rather versatile comedic actor. Paul Rudd plays his role about how it should be played. Nothing spectacular, but on target. The rest of the cast does their job.The script seems sort of schizophrenic.

I saw many trailers showing the dinner as the main target, yet while watching the film, the whole dinner is basically just used as a subplot. It gets talked about quite a lot throughout the film but once it reaches that point, it seems very dull and predictable. The main plot was basically the relationship with Paul Rudd's character and his girlfriend after Steve Carell's character comes into Rudd's life only to stir up their relationship.Their were may awkward situations and many unfunny scenes. For most the characters were just annoying and unlikable, specifically Stev Carell's character. His character Barry just forced himself threw Tim's life without anything- he cause him to ruined Tim's relationship with his girlfriend and almost ruining his job promotion, yet of course at the end it ends with a happy ending. The dinner scene (start around 83min) was quite okay, not funny as it should have been but entertaining in the least. The mouse art by Carell's character was pretty neat.

32,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Idiocy reigns supreme, for better or for worse",5,22 January 2011,"The French film that ""Dinner for Schmucks"" draws its inspiration from,  ""Le Diner de Cons,"" was successful because it made us seriously ponder  who the real idiot was -- the up-and- coming businessman or the dolt he  must invite to a business dinner. With ""Schmucks,"" you seriously ponder  if the real idiot has been you for watching the thing in the first  place. Good news is if you can make it through the bumbling first half,  ""Schmucks"" turns itself around in almost redeeming fashion.  Paul Rudd plays Tim and Steve Carell plays Barry. The former works at  an Equity Firm and seeks a big promotion; the latter works for the IRS  and makes dioramas featuring dead mice dressed as people. Their paths  cross because after hitting Barry with his car, Tim realizes he's a  perfect fit for the ""idiot dinner"" that his boss has invited him to,  one that he learns will have implications for his future at the firm.  Unfortunately, Barry is a bit of a leech, and what Tim expects to be a  brief dinner that he can forget about later turns into 48 hours of  mind- numbing stupidity.  Not until Tim gets stuck deep in the shenanigans does any real humor  come out of ""Schmucks."" At first, writers Michael Handelman and David  Guion (co-writers of the barely seen comedy ""The Ex"" starring Jason  Bateman and Zach Braff) determine that Barry's idiocy justifies him  instigating the film's events with any absurd action they deem helpful  to the story. While we learn eventually just how clueless Barry really  is, his character had not been established as so socially inconsiderate  as to instant message with Tim's stalker Darla (Lucy Punch), the event  that sets everything into motion. Once that snowball gets rolling, the  situational comedy that ends up working does come out of it, but that  singular action was weakly constructed, topping the long and bad  highlight reel of the first act.  The moment that turns around ""Dinner for Schmucks"" completely comes at  an important business meeting between Tim and a Swiss billionaire  looking to invest with the firm. Tim's expecting a letdown because his  girlfriend, Julie (Stephanie Szostak), who was supposed to attend with  him to talk art with the investor's wife, has walked out on Tim,  partially thanks to Barry. In hopes of saving the day, Barry recruits  Darla the psycho to pose as Julie without telling Tim about it. Barry  and Darla join the meeting, which doesn't go quite how you'd expect.  Although spurred by the recurring ""accidental cell phone switch"" gag,  the key is that the scene gets you to think ""wow, Barry really is a  total idiot!"" and the whole thing will likely crumble beneath Tim,  including his job and relationship. Finally, Carell's Barry starts to  feel like a real character. Although not a cure-all for the film's  ills, that establishment works wonders on your ability to merely enjoy  it at all.  We've known for a while that Carell can do the idiot thing. From  ""Anchorman"" to seven seasons of ""The Office"" on NBC, no one does the  clueless guy better or to greater comic effect. He churns Barry into a  fairly likable numbskull, but the character operates as Michael Scott  on ""The Office"" and Brick Tamland from ""Anchorman"" combined into one  schizophrenic person. At one moment he's sweetly screwing everything  up, the next he's laughing at a chimpanzee on television. Given the  writing, it's not entirely evident just how stupid (or what kind of  stupid) Barry is supposed to be. Only toward the end does it take  shape. Director Jay Roach (""Meet the Parents,"" ""Austin Powers"") also  finds his groove here too.  ""Schmucks"" loosely follows the French film, the big change being the  actual dinner itself, which never happens in the original. Here, it  serves as the last-ditch effort for laughs by introducing bizarre  peripheral characters in the form of the other idiot guests, the  highlight being a woman who acts as a psychic medium for dead animals.  Some of the components of this finale are meant to serve the individual  subplots for Barry and Tim, which along with a few laughs make it  worthwhile. We learn, for example, that Barry's wife left him because,  as he puts it, ""he lost the clitoris."" Jokes aside, it's part of what  allows Tim to see Barry's humanity and puts a nice touch on their  relationship, which is the heart of the story and what made ""Le Diner  de Cons"" so terrific.  Ultimately, however, the setup does the payoff no justice and  ""Schmucks"" never fully washes out that first lengthy bad taste. So for  different reasons, the question of true idiocy remains unanswered -- or  simply that we're all idiots, including Hollywood.  ~Steven C",Dinner for Schmucks

Steve Carell again proves that he may the best comic actor in Hollywood today. He carries this movie. Without him the movie would have been unwatchable. The actual story is simple to the point of inanity. The attempts at farce fall flat but Mr. Carell delivers his lines with such feeling that he makes even the most trite and inane comments sound convincing. The title itself indicates what this story is about, except that the schmucks are not who you think they are, which is what makes it a good movie. The movie causes the audience to ask: who are the schmucks? Most of the characters are goofy but not funny. Paul Rudd's straight man is weak and the female roles are unfunny. This movie is a vehicle for Steve Carell. It is his movie and he makes the most of it, weak material and all.",Dinner for Schmucks
36,meeza,I wish I could exterminate this Roach-infested flick from his otherwise impressive body of work,5,24 April 2011,"Director Jay Roach's roach-coach comedy ""Dinner for Schmucks"" is one schmuck of a movie. I had an appetite for a quirky comedia pelicula with some eccentric characters and a magnetic narrative. But instead what the Roach-coach fed us was an unpleasant, dull movie about a rising executive named Tim whose superiors force him to bring a human target to humiliate in a ""hence movie title"". Tim meets the leading schmuck character of the film Barry while crashing his vehicle into Barry as Tim was texting while driving. Tim is played by the charismatic Paul Rudd, and Barry is played by a spectacled nerdy-looking Steve Carell. We all know that Carell and Rudd are consummate comedic pros who have proficiently showed their diverse talent both in television and movies. But there is nothing they could have done to save this awful cinebistro flick when they were handed a profoundly disoriented and steadily queasy screenplay by David Guion and Michael Handelman; a scribe that should have been ""handled"" by other ""men"". In returning to the narrative, ""why?"" probably because I am schmuck enough to continue to write about this movie, Tim longs to prove to his girlfriend Julie that he could move up the ranks in the business world, so he accepts the invitation by his boss Lance Fender to this ""dinner for schmucks"". Julie despises the idea but Tim goes along with it anyways. Upon meeting Barry and seeing all the schmuckering qualities he possesses, Tim then decides that ""he has found his schmuck"" for the din din. What follows is a slapstick boringpalooza which includes a stalking female psycho, a Swiss millionaire egomaniac, an outlandish artist, and a mind-controlling obsessed accountant. Actually, the last one was not too bad due to the fact that it was portrayed by the scene-stealing Zach Galifianakis. Too bad Roach did not ""hang over"" more scenes to the brain controller quack Therman, but not even Zach's comical efforts could save this turd of a movie. My main complaint of the cinematic service of ""Dinner for Schmucks"" was the disservice it did in degrading those with eccentric hobbies or passions. Sure it had to be part of the narrative, but Roach (who has proved he is a viable talented auteur in the past) did nothing inspiring or genial to glorify those with certain ""out of the ordinary"" talents or as the mass bullying population likes to call them.. ""idiots"" or ""nerds"". So without a doubt, this film is major ammunition to increase the senseless bullying that hurts many day after day. Maybe I should take it as a grain of salt, and not dwell on it, but there was no tasty grain of salt or anything else tasty for that matter in this cinematic dinner table that should warrant a reservation with the ""Dinner for Schmucks"". ** Needs Improvement",Dinner for Schmucks

Paul Rudd is the stereotypical jerk in the movie, and Carrel is the stereotypical idiot in the movie that you on one hand feel very sorry for, then on the other hand, you are incredibly annoyed by him.

38,myriamlenys,feel free to go on a diet,4,21 August 2018,"Time for a sad confession : although I've seen my share of comedies, I am unfamiliar with the French movie ""Dinner for Schmucks"" is based on. This is ""a hole in my culture"", as they say here in Flanders, but alas, it is true. On the plus side, I watched ""Dinner"" without preconceptions. The movie tells the story of a young and ambitious executive. Fate seems to smile upon him when his boss invites him to a dinner party. There's one catch : guests are expected to bring along weirdos and misfits, so that those who are in on the joke can have a good laugh. As it so happens, the young executive has just met a prime fool... The movie fails, mainly because it cannot decide what it wants to be : sharp, fierce and cynical or heart-warming and life-affirming. It tries to be both, resulting in an unholy tonal mess. Three other reasons why the movie sucks like a Transsylvanian count : 1) a lack of subtlety, 2) big sugary dollops of sentimentality and 3) some pretty weird ideas about what does, and what doesn't, constitute cuteness. For instance, at the beginning of ""Dinner"", there is a sequence where a man creates a gloriously sunny and happy little landscape, complete with miniature mice-shaped dolls. How adorable ! Little mice courting, juggling, frolicking ! It is only later that the viewer discovers that these are supposed to be dead mice preserved by taxidermy, which is considerably more sinister. Yet for some strange reason the movie insists that this is a sweet, normal, inoffensive hobby, comparable to stamp collecting. Another example : the movie ends with one of the male characters beginning a steamy affair with a beautiful and sexy woman. How nice, one might think. However, the man is a disaster-prone and tone-deaf idiot while the woman has a history of stalking and transgressing boundaries. Give this affair three weeks and it will turn into the kind of nightmare fodder where stunned sheriffs gaze into the cameras and say : ""I've been in law enforcement for 24 years now and I never saw anything like it"".I'm still handing out 4 stars because I liked the central conceit, about rich jerks inviting people so that they can mock them. (Which, by the way, is a betrayal of hospitality many ancient peoples would have considered sacrilegous to the extreme.) It's a good metaphor about the way the rich view their fellow men : as victims to be flattered, abused and debased.",Dinner for Schmucks
39,Jonny_Numb,Schmucktastic!,7,16 August 2010,"Of all the things that continue to surprise me about the comic genius of Steve Carell (who won me over indefinitely with his signature turn in ""The 40-Year Old Virgin""), the biggest is the fact that his pervasive presence in cinema has not become a source of burned-out annoyance. Unlike Jim Carrey, who held a nation captive with his rubbery contortions and crude humor, Carell can play dramatic angles as shrewdly as sharply funny punchlines. His versatility is given a workout in ""Dinner for Schmucks"" (ported over from a French short), wherein he plays Barry, an overly literal-minded buffoon whose hobby is stuffing dead mice and transplanting them into serenely artistic dioramas. When he steps into traffic to save a specimen one day, he is hit by Tim (Paul Rudd), a middle-management type looking to climb the executive ladder; his superiors have tasked him with bringing an ""eccentric"" to a dinner designed to mock those with unique or unusual talents, the ""winner"" providing entry to a more powerful position. Seizing upon this opportunity against the protestations of his girlfriend, Barry becomes a disastrous drag on Tim's life for 48 hours, leading to many hilarious moments (ranging from bull-in-china-shop slapstick to inspired dialog exchanges). A veteran of the ripe-to-rancid ""Austin Powers"" franchise, director Jay Roach and his writers do an expert job of juxtaposing humor with a genuine empathy for the central characters -- more than mere grist for the comedic mill, Carell strikes genuinely touching dramatic notes, especially when we wonder just how the titular event is going to play without feeling hypocritical and manipulative (it helps that Rudd makes a similarly capable foil to both the humor and humanity). Aside from a running time that feels long by 20 minutes, ""Dinner for Schmucks"" is a date worth keeping.",Dinner for Schmucks

44,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,Dinner for Schmucks (2010),4,14 December 2011,"A predictably loud and crass American interpretation of a mini-classic from France. This film is full of comedic actors, unintentionally following the plot of the film. The film sees businessmen bring idiots to dinner, trying to one-up each other. The film itself has a bunch of comedic actors, trying to be as over-the-top as possible, in an attempt to one-up each other. These shenanigans are distracting and sometimes shameful. As Carell and Galifianakis shoot mind bullets at each other, no one is having as much fun as them. Rudd tries to play it likable, while Carell is too stupid to care about. The original had me switching allegiances between a genuinely horrible guy and a doofus. Adding the actual dinner to the film just leads to a predictable message and a painful running time. It's nice to see so many comedians from New Zealand, the UK, and America, but no one has enough to do. The original was subtle, witty, and clever. This is a loud and obnoxious ego inflation.",Dinner for Schmucks
45,lewiskendell,"Rough start, but Dinner for Schmuck's fortunately gets better.",7,5 January 2011,"""Sometimes I think you think I'm an idiot.""There's no denying that in some ways, Dinner for Schmucks is a disappointment. There are sky high expectations (at least, from me), whenever Steve Carell and Paul Rudd team up, as they are two of the funniest actors working today. Anything the two of them collaborate on should be amazing, and sadly, Dinner for Schmucks falls short of that mark.The first of main two problems was that Carell's character (the primary schmuck referenced in the title) is so idiotic, insufferable, and unlikeable, that it throws much of the movie off. He's like a walking disaster from the second Paul Rudd's character meets him, until almost right up until the end. Imagine Carell's character from The Office, only 5 times stupider, 10 times more annoying, and with no real redeeming qualities. Towards the end of the film, there's an attempt to make the character more sympathetic and likable, but by then I was so thoroughly sick of him that it was almost too late. The second problem I had with Dinner for Schmucks is that so many of the jokes, especially in the early part of the movie, were complete and utter misses. It's like the writers were just throwing out every gag they could think of to see if any of it would stick. Fortunately, there were some really hilarious parts, as well, and a lot of them were thanks to the outstanding supporting cast. Especially Zach Galifiankis and Lucy Punch, who completely stole the movie every time they were on-screen. Eventually, Carell and Rudd got some better material to work with, too, making the last two-thirds of the movie a much funnier experience.Dinner for Schmucks started off as a pretty mediocre comedy, but it slowly picked up steam until I was reasonably pleased with it, by the end. It's no 40 Year-Old Virgin or Anchorman, but it's worth checking out.",Dinner for Schmucks
46,brando647,Steve Carell Keeps the Film Entertaining,7,12 January 2011,"I was not too impressed when I saw this film in theaters. I had been excited for it because I'm a major fan of it's two leads: Paul Rudd and Steve Carell. Rarely has either of these comedians been in a film that I didn't enjoy, but this one came close. The film is about Tim Conrad (Rudd) who is given the opportunity for a long-awaited promotion when he impresses his boss. As a form of initiation, Tim is invited to a special dinner where each person brings a ""special"" guest. The game is to see who can bring the biggest idiot and Tim believes he's found a winner when he (literally) runs into Barry Speck (Carell). Barry is an IRS agent whose hobby is making dioramas with dead mice. Meanwhile, Tim's long-time girlfriend Julie (Stephanie Szostak) is appalled at the idea of making fun of people for entertainment and their relationship is strained when Tim seems determined to attend the dinner to impress his boss and prove he's ready to move up in the company. Matters are complicated when Barry becomes involved and Tim's life begins to fall apart around him.The main problem with this film was the advertising campaign. The trailers lead viewers to believe that the dinner and it's lunatic attendees are a major portion of the film. In reality, the dinner doesn't occur until the final 20 minutes or so and the bulk of the film is watching Barry's arrival unravel Tim's life. It's not a terrible problem, but it is unfortunately misleading to those who aren't familiar with the film this movie was based upon, LE DINER DE CONS. As I watched this film originally in theaters, I was a bit let down and perhaps that affected how I received it. I've seen it since and each time I watch it, I find myself laughing more and more. It's certainly growing on me and I'm coming to appreciate the cast's performances more each time. There's definitely some quotable material here (mostly thanks to Jemaine Clement) and the film boasts some great talent.Paul Rudd has proved himself a great straight-man in recent comedies and he continues to impress here. He isn't given a lot of great moments as he's meant to be recipient of the chaos, courtesy of Carell as his idiot. I'm starting to see this as one of my favorite performances from Carell. He's a complete fool but he is so unbelievably charming that you can only laugh at him, even in his dumbest moments. He injects Barry with enough heart to keep him from becoming the creepy guy who plays with dead mice. The film's other great role would be Jemaine Clement as artist Kieran Vollard. I definitely got an Aldous Snow vibe from him, though instead of a crazed rock star he's a sexed up modern artist. He's got some of the best lines in the film (""I'm just a goat that's halfway through eating itself."") and he plays it completely deadpan. We also get the usual comedy from Zach Galifianakis as Barry's boss Therman. His character has a lot of qualities in common with his character in THE HANGOVER (idiotic with over-confidence) but he does it well and it's yet to wear thin on me.The film has a bit of a jerky pace and it feels like it runs on a bit too long, but that's all forgotten when we finally arrive at the titular dinner. The final 20 minutes of the film are the best and make the whole film worth watching, if only once. It's a funny enough flick and it's great to see Rudd and Carell working off each other. It's not going to garner any awards attention but it's good for a couple laughs if you're in the mood.",Dinner for Schmucks

Carell is never funny except for that one time in BRUCE ALMIGHTY when Bruce, as GOD, made him talk gibberish. I did also say that, perhaps, the only funny thing in here would be the title.And, after about a half hour into the movie when Carell showed up and acted the way he did in his character (as the idiot), I knew I could not watch the rest of the way. He was bad, not funny, but also the dialogue for everyone else was bad too.I wanted to make it to that dinner, but knew in my heart of hearts I would go crazy watching really stupid stuff so I shut it down and regained my sanity.

Now, they have united for Dinner for Schmucks, the hilarious new comedy from director Jay Roach(Austin Powers, Meet the parents). Despite mixed reviews, I still had a blast with this film.Paul Rudd is Tim, your typical business man who tries to get in good with the company. By doing so, he is invited for a so called ""Dinner for idiots"", where they find morons, bring them there, and make fun of them. Tim hits Barry(Steve Carell), a nerdy guy who makes models with dead mice, with his car.This is obviously a mistake. Because Barry is a moron. And he ruins Tim's life. He helps his relationship with his girlfriend Julie go down, he gets Tim involved with this psycho that he slept with, and he ruins his job opportunities. Which, if you think about it, is karma for going to such a party.Dinner for Schmucks is hilarious. It keeps going until the end. The supporting cast is excellent also. Dinner for Schmucks is more adventurous than you'd want to believe. It's a very entertaining film also, and I laughed out loud numerous times.When you first hear about what its about, you'll think ""That's sick"". But actually, it has a good message in the end. If you do something mean to others, it will come back to bite you on the ass. It did for Tim. I'm glad it covered that. Carell and Rudd are two of the funniest people out there, and Roach has always had a talent for funny films. Together, these three make a comedy that is high on energy.

62,bopdog,A sad sack of crap- Tedious and DULL,1,3 August 2010,"I blame myself. The reviews were largely awful, and many of the user comments here on IMDb also warned people. I didn't heed those signs. This movie was worse than bad. It was worse than a waste of money. This was one of those films wherein one feels angry and betrayed that my TIME was wasted. My high spirits were deflated, and I slunk from the cinema feeling like hammered garbage.For me the problem wasn't grossness. I love grossness, if it's genius and hilarious. Fart jokes and boobie jokes and what-have-you jokes are the true refined conversation of the enlightened man and woman. Make me laugh so beer explodes out my nose and I am with you 100%. The problem with this drivel is that it was that slow, tedious and annoying type of ""humour"" that grinds on and on with no laughs. It just isn't funny. It's wearisome.Compared to this film, David Spade seems like Ingmar Bergman. Heed my call, O my brothers and sisters! Step thee not into this cinematic trick of the no-talent hucksters. Golly, doing just about anything else would be your time better spent.",Dinner for Schmucks
63,jucsetmai,Dinner for Schmucks on 4k ultra hd,8,18 January 2021,"So I just gave this one another spin last night. Watching so much horror lately, that I felt like a needed a comedy in my life.I watched this when it came out, and remember thinking it was ok, but not that funny. However, upon revisiting it last night, I laughed really hard almost all the way through, and thought Zack Galf stole every scene he was in. It really is a funny movie, but it does have a couple of fatal flaws. Mostly narrative flaws, though.The ""message"" of the movie is that it's not good to laugh at idiots who aren't aware of how silly they are, while asking the audience to do just that very thing! Also, Steve's character isn't a lovable idiot at all.We're supposed to care about him, as he isn't being intentionally malevolent, but all of his actions towards Paul Rudd's character are utterly life destroying. Even after Paul asks him to stop being such a destructive force, he continues to wreck Paul's life. Being that he has to actively do these destructive things, I had no sympathy for him, and would have been way meaner to him than Paul Rudd was, mean enough to make him want to leave me alone.The failure of this film, is that Jay Roach wanted it both ways. He wanted to tell us it's bad to laugh at these people, while asking us to laugh at these people. He wanted us to feel bad for Steve's character, while he is being a terrible person.Having said that, I will reiterate that I laughed my socks off, so how do you rate a film like that? I don't know, and I'm at a loss on this one now on upgrade Upscaled 4K and Dolby Vision coming soon on paramount pictures 4k ultra hd release July 2021",Dinner for Schmucks

65,policy134,Wow. There are some pretty angry reviews here,5,3 April 2011,"Okay, so this is not the best work of either Roach, Carell or Rudd but to call it trash is really way over the top, even for hardcore bloggers.Sure, some of the situations are a bit of a stretch of the imagination but the idea here is insanely coherent. Haven't you met someone like Carell's character who will do everything to please but keeps overdoing it. Carell's interest in taxidermy is not a great comic hook, but haven't you seen much worse.When I saw the first 5 minutes, I was worried that this was turning into another Cable Guy. I was so relieved it didn't. Carell is not insane or a genuine loser like The Cable Guy. He is not totally average and the buck teeth are a little much, but that is the standard character of sub-par intelligence, I guess.The actual Dinner Party should have been a little bit more thought out, though. It's not that funny and the most unbelievable part of the whole movie. But the rest is pretty good. The bonding between Rudd and Carell is for the most part believable and the insane ex-girlfriend is only a minor annoyance.One major problem. Why is there always a subplot involving why a guy can't get a girl to marry him involved in these films? 'Cause that's what moviegoers relate to? The girlfriend character is absolutely superfluous here.",Dinner for Schmucks

67,josh_lambert1991,Perfect cast,7,26 January 2019,Getting Paul Rudd and Steve Carrell together you are always going to get laughs and that is exactly what you get with this film. A great film with lots of great laughs. Definitely a film you can watch over again,Dinner for Schmucks
68,TheAll-SeeingI,Even Better In The Anti-Bullying Age!,8,1 November 2019,"Everyone grimaces at the contrived version of the goofball -- the knowing exhibitionist that puts his or her manufactured quirkiness on blast to assume the very center of attention. Rest assured that the massively underrated ""Dinner for Schmucks"" bears no resemblance to that unsightly phenomenon.Barry Speck - played by generational genius Steve Carrell - is wholly self-assured, albeit only because he has no clue -- zero awareness that anything he does may seem undesirable or inane. Indeed, he is a natural born schmuck, and a massively endearing one at that. Complimented by the increasingly legendary Paul Rudd as Tim Conrad -- an aspirational young man in a nascent and hopeful ascent up the corporate ladder -- this is a comedy pairing forged in the Pantheon, and one with few peers. The setting is a dinner party hosted by affluent and demeaning old men who think Barry is a joke -- that's why they've invited him. Yet these elitist buffoons are the ones upon whom their own joke is perversely cracked, and therein rests the true ambition and glory of ""Dinner For Schmucks."" Carrell's inhabiting of his clueless yet paradoxically inspiring character reminds us that you can't successfully ridicule a man so self-contented that he doesn't even recognize barbs tossed his way as malicious in design.In the sum of its parts, ""Dinner for Schmucks"" champions the at-ease individualism of the unknowingly quirky characters that make this life worth living. The elevation of that archetype comes at the highly enjoyable expense of the easily-identifiable knobs seeking self-validation by ridiculing others. Leveraging the core attributes of farce and slapstick in equally maximized measure, ""Dinner for Schumucks"" is a great comedy film that's managed to go unheralded despite its aspirational cast and inspirational execution. For fans of the funny, absurd, and smart alike, and particular so in this welcomed and newfound era of the anti-bully.

The potential inspirational message is botched in the messy pivotal dinner scene (Barry's beautiful dream presentation was overshadowed by the dumb hi-jinx afterwards) but the reunion at Tim's place was a nice recovery.",Dinner for Schmucks
70,diac228,"Like a fancy restaurant with all style and no substance, Dinner for Schmucks has all the pieces for awesome potential, but none of them fit",3,31 July 2010,"Dinner for Schmucks is a very weak comedy that has trouble getting its footing from the beginning, resulting in a total tumble for the rest of the film. What surprises me the most about this movie is that the talent was most certainly there, but with a very weak script and poor pacing, the movie maintains a disappointing taste throughout the overlong 114 minutes. Paul Rudd is among the funniest out there in terms of deadpan and everyday man humor, while Steve Carell is easily one of the brightest comedy talents in Hollywood. Then we have Jay Roach, who has plenty of comedic experience with the like of Meet the Parents and Austin Powers. But despite the capability and decent resume, they all fail in delivering the laughs.From the trailers (which were weak too), it looks like the big focus is on the dinner planned by higher-ups in a company that requires that you bring an idiot to dine with the bosses. Instead, Dinner for Schmucks is about an aspiring rising executive (Tim, played by Paul Rudd) and his complications after accidentally meeting the idiotic but unselfish and sweet IRS employee (Barry, played by Steve Carell). Their encounter together triggers a series of events that involves a psycho stalker, a unique artist, several mix-ups, and the potential ending of the relationship between the main character and his girlfriend (Stephanie Szostak). This movie is a remake of a 1998 French black comedy Le dîner de cons, and with some of the humor and subject matter, the French influence was a bit heavy.The weakest portion of the movie is clearly the writing. The script was full of bad jokes, pointless scenes, predictability, very little payoff, and worst of all prevented the cast from adding the extra ommph needed to make this a truly enjoyable film. Surely there were some funny moments and some funny situations, but overall Rudd, Carell, and Jay Roach did not have much to work with. Even the main dinner itself had minimal time to expand or evolve into something very memorable to the likes of the infamous dinner scenes of Meet the Parents, Goodfellas, or American Beauty. The script was easily the weakest part of the movie, because the material presented just wasn't good at all.Steve Carell and Paul Rudd are among my favorite actors in Hollywood. Their comedic timing is impeccable, with Anchorman and Role Models being the best examples. However, they had very little to work with. Paul Rudd had to play the backseat to become the middle man, with no chance of being remotely funny. With Steve Carell's character, it's even worse, because he was written so poorly. Clearly, he couldn't improvise much, but what was written down was not funny at all. They consisted of stupid lines, stupider comments, and sometimes plain garbage. The trailer definitely hid all the actual funny lines from Carell, but clearly it was because there isn't much to begin with. Even Zach Galifanakis, who is a rising force in comedy, couldn't deliver anything past a chuckle. This is one of the few cases in which the actors are not to blame; they did the best they could. Jay Roach isn't exactly a genius, but usually does know how to maintain pace and deliver some fun little surprises here and there. With Dinner for Schmucks, there weren't any fun surprises, and the comic timing was a bit off. The softer, more heartfelt scenes were handled with much better care, especially when Barry is seen working and displaying his hobby. The dinner itself however could have been much better, and this missed opportunity really hampers the overall movie, especially after all the build-up. The film was nearly two hours long, and I can guarantee you that less than 15 minutes was dedicated to the big finale, the gigantic climax. That was supposed to be the big payoff. Compare this to the comedic classic Blazing Saddles, when the final battle becomes insanely elongated, but utterly hilarious in all its insanity and impulsiveness (if you have not seen this movie yet Netflix it immediately). Dinner for Schmucks has the makings of an insane comedy that cannot be predicted—unfortunately, doesn't deliver on the premise and the promise.Bottom Line: Dinner for Schmucks is a tough movie to fully rip apart and garnish it with a very low rating, because of the comedic talent and obvious effort involved. But, I personally saw a stinkpile of a script totally ruining and obliterating any possible attempt at becoming the big comedy of the summer; becoming this year's Hangover or There's Something About Mary. The acting wasn't too bad, the directing wasn't a disaster, and there weren't a lot of technical annoyances. But the storyline, pacing, dialogue, lack of a heart and lack of structure destroyed the quality of this movie. In order for your comedy to succeed, there must be a bit of heart and allure attached, whether it's subtle or clearly out there. If there is someone to blame, definitely blame it on David Guion and Michael Handelman. You two, please go back to your writing classes please, you clearly did not pass. Rudd and Carell were not as charming or as funny in similar previous roles (Danny in Role Models and Brick in Anchorman respectively), and Jay Roach has definitely seen better days (Austin Powers—the original and maybe the sequel; Meet the Parents). To say you won't laugh at all is exaggerating, but there isn't a standout moment, and there most certainly isn't a reason to join this dinner a second time.",Dinner for Schmucks

72,krachtm,"Not too bad, not that great. Tolerable, safe humor for Steve Carrell fans.",6,22 December 2010,"Often, when I watch a movie where someone's life spirals out of control, due to the well-intentioned mistakes of a doofus friend, I get kind of annoyed. For some reason, it frustrates me, perhaps because the plot is usually so unbelievable (how can *everything* go to crap in the space of 24 hours?). There was a little bit of that in this movie, but it seemed a little more believable than other movies. Unfortunately, there was so much emphasis on plot, the romance between the lead and his girlfriend, and the friendship between the two leads, I started getting a little bored! I wasn't expecting this movie to be so long or so sappy for extended periods of time.I know this is based on a French movie (which I haven't seen yet, unfortunately), but it seems almost like a remake of The Cable Guy, with Jim Carrey, with more sexual humor and less creepiness. Truthfully, I preferred the Cable Guy, though this movie does have some amusing (though not laugh-out-loud funny) scenes.If you like light-hearted comedies that have a little bit of bite, you'll probably enjoy this movie. If you're more into innocent Disney movies or really dark humor (like Very Bad Things), you'll dislike it, though I found it mostly tolerable, and I loved Very Bad Things, so who knows.

73,eagandersongil,"Good characters, bad script",6,30 October 2018,"""A dinner for idiots"" is a good comedy that sometimes gets confused in its own proposal, because the long one of the well-known Jay Roach and stuffed of good actors sometimes takes to serious, sometimes abuses of the besteirol, sometimes it extends too much a scene dramatic or hilarious, this is very guilty of the script, which is weak, we do not have much to judge here, comedy, scenes of shame sand, lesson sugar water, all within the standards of American comedy. Technically, the film is good, well directed, with a cool track, use of scene composition and a slightly more neutral photograph, uncommon in comedy films, a great third act that compensates the weak first two, despite having it wonderful - Steve Carrel and Paul Rudd in the cast, the big highlight is for Zach Galifianakis who makes a simply wonderful character with a very funny performance, his character is the great high point of the film that despite many problematic, is funny.",Dinner for Schmucks
74,dvc5159,Haven't seen the original; this is genuinely hilarious at times. I'm gonna go look for the original now.,6,2 October 2010,"This is a short review.Paul Rudd's performance is still the same from the ""Role Models"" and ""I Love You, Man"" days. I fear that he will be type-casted. However once Steve Carell enters the picture the movie suddenly accelerates into non- stop gags. Some jokes fall flat; many gave me lots of chuckles; and a few actually made me laugh 'till my throat went sore. This is a film which is proud of being a gag/slapstick/screwball comedy, and it pays off. There are some sexual jokes which may push the boundaries of its PG-13 rating but still manages to be funny.Now I have to admit Carell's character is so annoying/stupid/insane that you just have to stop taking the film as a realistic comedy and just accept the absurdity that poor Rudd's character has to go through. The plot is predictable but merely used as a vehicle to get the gag ball rolling.It's good to watch if you have nothing else to watch. I'll now look for the original French version, seeing that a lot of people said it's more hilarious.A lot of people seem to hate this movie. It's a comedy, albeit an absurd one.

75,Jackpollins,Funny stuff,8,6 August 2010,"From The Office to Anchorman, Steve Carrell has proved time and time again that he plays stupid & unaware really well, and with Dinenr For Schmucks, he gets to prove that again. Carrell plays Barry, a dumb and unaware, hence my previous statement man who decorates art with dead mice. Paul Rudd is Tim, a businessman who must bring an idiot to a dinner to get a very large promotion. Low and behold, Tim hits Barry with his car. Carrell & Rudd have nice chemistry and are very funny both together and separately. That said, the real star here is Jermaine Clement as Kieran, an edgy artist whom Tim's girlfriend Julie (Stephanie Szostak) works for. Kieran is edgy, which is what makes him funny, you never know what he's gonna say or, in that case, do next. That's a similarity to the character of Barry. Although Barry is stupid, he's not 100% stupid, and therefore you never know how Barry's gonna screw someone's life accidentally, or on purpose. Zach Galifianakis, who was hilarious in The Hangover shows up here as Barry's mind controlling co worker Thermal, and he once again proves that he's one of the funniest men working in film today. Overall, Dinner For Schmucks is a hilarious and hilariously fun time at the movies, and you should go out and see it if you just feel like laughing.",Dinner for Schmucks
76,deepfrieddodo,More Frustrating Than Funny,5,1 September 2020,"Whilst the film picks up towards the end and gives a few actual laughs, for the most part it's just frustrating. Carrell plays a character likened to Brick in Anchorman, but Anchorman works because Brick is a secondary character who chips in with absurd things occasionally. Having this same character as the lead does not work. It's a shame that such an impressive cast (plus a couple of duds) weren't utilised until it was too late.",Dinner for Schmucks

Such is not the case in practice. OK, The film manages to elicit a couple tiny chuckles. Whoop-Dee-Do. That is not nearly enough, or close to nearly enough, to recommend any of it. Are Steve Carrell and Paul Rudd miscast here, or are they just subtly acting? I am just not convinced they are trying at all. What we have here is a premise desperately, and I mean desperately, in search of a movie. Well, I'll admit it was a mistake to see this on the big screen. Needless to say, it's a waste of one's money. So what if Barry is a nerd? We don't care about him in the least because he has no redeeming qualities. And when we get to the main event, we don't care what happens. Another thing: what is the point of Darla's appearance other than to make Tim miserable?** out of ****",Dinner for Schmucks

Filled with little jokes and some smart references, Dinner For Schmucks does pull off a small feat, but it just doesn't feel like it can go the full mile. Some parts of this film are quite cringe worthy, boring and plain unfunny, whilst other parts do manage to make you giggle a bit.If you watch Dinner For Schmucks, one thing you will notice is the incredibly hilarious performance by Zach Galifianakis.

79,Ryan_MYeah,The creators of this movie are dumber than the title idiots.,2,13 March 2012,"Just, WOW! This movie is amazing. It is miraculously bad. A massive misfire to end all misfires.The screenplay has absolutely no thought put into it, nor any care for how inconsistently it flows. When it isn't overly dull and talky, the comedy aspect is incredibly mean spirited, not to mention hypocritical. The film has a half baked moral of treating ""extraordinary people"" as equal, but it feels no shame in exploiting them so much beforehand, and even after the moral is practically spelled out. These creators are more moronic than the title idiots.On top of that, the movie is directed with no discipline whatsoever by Jay Roach. Paul Rudd can't use a single ounce of his flat character to his advantage, and Steve Carell's wonderful comedic charm is ultimately absent, and is littered with annoyance. His character is so irritating that I just wanted to strangle him. And you've also got some talented comics in this movie like Jemaine Clement, but they just flat out suck.Saving Graces? Few. Kristen Schaal has some half decent zingers (Though I credit that more to her improv than the script), and Zach Galifianakis gives the one legitimately funny performance in the movie, but it's an overall dull experience.

If I've ever felt sorry for an opportunist fraud, it was in this film. Steve Carrell's character who makes the saddest dioramas out of dead mice is one of the densest, most destructive and most optimistic people I've ever seen portrayed on film. I was appalled at the utter cringe. However, Carrell carries it off, making me both love and want to murder him, same as Paul Rudd's character does. I don't know if this dynamic is dysfunctional or masterful. Anyway, apart from their dynamic, the other characters in the film are either wet blankets (Julie the girlfriend) or like, some of the most colorful characters (Kieran the sexual artist) ever. I enjoyed the originality of this film and its pathos. I really felt for Carrell's character.",Dinner for Schmucks
81,Scott_Mercer,Well Worth Seeing,8,31 July 2010,"I don't give two Euros if this is a remake of another film from Europe. I'm going to judge this film as if that other movie never existed. And, what do you know, for me, it doesn't. I have never seen that film, so it is of no importance. And, oh yes, it's French.That out of the way, let's get down to brass tacks. Is Dinner For Schmucks funny? Oh yes. In fact, I can find very little bad to say about this film. The acting was the best thing about it. Casting was superb. Jemaine was perfectly cast. I have to mention Zach Gallifanakis, who has caused me to laugh out loud at every part in every movie I have seen him in. So damn funny. ""I release you!"" has to be the catchprhase of the film, unless it's another one of Zach's lines, ""Say you'll let me eat your Pudding."" Carell was spot-on. Carell's character had to be annoying yet lovable at the same time. He's screwing everything up, but for all the right and noble reasons. Barry had to be somewhat pathetic but not pitiable. I think we all know people like that. He nailed it. Rudd had to portray the ambitious striver, willing to sell out his standards, but all the while feeling guilty for doing it.Rudd's part as Tim in this film encapsulates the hero's journey. Like all heroes of classical literature, he has a flaw: his desire to get ahead at any costs and impress Julie, his girlfriend who has already refused his marriage proposals several times. What he does not realize is that Julie is turning down his marriage requests not because he ""hasn't made it,"" but because she is not sure about his morality, and as it turns out, she has every right to be. But we go along with Rudd on his journey, and by the end, with the help of the annoying Barry, Tim has learned something about other people, about Barry, but mostly about himself.Jay Roach's direction was fine, if not impeccable. The writing hit all the correct notes. There were a few plot holes, but nothing major, and a few instances of the dreaded ""ADR plot point,"" in which the filmmakers try to clear up confusing elements of the story by dubbing in extra lines clumsily that were never in the script, usually heard while the character's back is turned to the camera and you can't see their lips. A pet peeve of mine. But these are small objections.And let's give some credit to the Chiodo Brothers for their excellent work on those lovingly assembled mouse dioramas.Is Dinner For Schmucks going to take its place in the pantheon of classic comedy, along side the likes of ""Stripes,"" ""Animal House"" and ""Dumb and Dumber""? Probably not quite. But it is very funny and very much worth the price of a theater ticket. If you end up missing it at the cinema, it is most definitely worth the price of a DVD rental, and then some.",Dinner for Schmucks
82,Ric-7,Extremely uneven and disappointing,5,4 August 2010,"I found about one-third of the film to be extremely funny. The rest was not funny, and occasionally it was almost painful to watch. I think that perhaps an editor could have shaved off at least 10-15 minutes and tightened everything up. If it can't be uproarious, it can at least move at a lively pace.As an example of what I mean, Steve Carrell's monologue at the dinner contained some truly wonderful lines, but the scene was way too ""cute."" And the dinner went on way too long: the scene after the award was made was definitely not funny. The vulture flying off with the finger probably sounded better in script conference than what we saw on screen.Zach G's Therman was not nearly as funny as it could have been. He obviously is capable of terrific comic acting, as in The Hangover. Here, the script didn't really give him much to do with a totally unbelievable character--not really a caricature of an actual person--just weird. How can this actor not be funny? I think the script did him in. And I don't think threatening people with an IRS audit is very funny, either.The big reconciliation scene at the end was not funny, went on much too long, and was a total anti-climax. I thought Kieran was another unbelievable character. Some of his lines were funny and believable, but others were just totally inconsistent and not funny.I guess I should have known there was trouble ahead when the opening credits featured amazingly creative and delicate mouse miniatures. I couldn't help thinking there would be a huge market for such art (or kitsch, but it's still marketable). And after that, I was asked to believe it was created by an idiot. And then asked to believe that this talented idiot worked for the IRS. And asked to find all of that funny.I don't recommend a trip to the cinema to see this. It might be worth a look later on television.",Dinner for Schmucks
83,colinrgeorge,"Too Much Schmucks, Not Enough Dinner",5,5 August 2010,"A confession: I am not the easiest person to make laugh. I'm like a comedy death-star, sitting impenetrably through most of what loosely passes as humor, but I am vulnerable to a very specific attack pattern. I also habitually see films on weekday afternoons, where it is not uncommon for attendance to be in the single digits. This is not the proper viewing experience for something like ""Dinner for Schmucks.""But be that as it may, its silences hung like ripe fruit throughout the overlong, often laugh- less endeavor. What I found probably most disappointing, though, was that the premise (you know, the title) is crammed into the last thirty minutes of a nearly two-hour film. The other eighty are spent mixing two of my least-favorite sub genres into a sleepy cocktail: workplace humor and romantic comedy.I understand the former is presently in vogue, and perhaps because I so admire the BBC ""Office,"" and Mike Judge's ""Office Space,"" more recent attempts at satirizing white-collar America have seemed, to me, incapable of pushing the envelope. It's ironic that Ron Livingston, who played the agnostic hero of Judge's film, plays his exact opposite in ""Schmucks""—An unapologetic businessman. But unlike the corporate lackeys in ""Office Space,"" he is counterbalanced by a protagonist (Paul Rudd) who wants just as desperately to assimilate himself to that ideal. His character, Tim, is someone for whom promotion is the only worthy goal.But what's worse is that he repeatedly fumbles his way toward that goal. He is asked to attend a sort of inaugural dinner party, accompanied, as every guest will be, by a fascinatingly imbecilic personage—Enter Steve Carell as Barry, a bland, dopey catalyst for frustrating, obvious misunderstandings.Had the plot remained so simple, there's a good chance I would have enjoyed ""Dinner for Schmucks."" The eponymous meal collects a compelling (and funny!) array of oddities, and the prevailing humor is decidedly absurdist. A better film would have built the entire second and third acts around this setting, but for over an hour we're subjected to the simple ruination of Tim's life at the hands of his new friend.For example, by way of an incomprehensible instant message conversation with an overeager ex, Barry leads Tim's girlfriend to suspect infidelity. Typically, this would be the type of comic scenario to employ double-entendre. Instead, Barry, at Tim's computer, seems to purposely provide misinformation. He may be a simpleton, but the scene is indicative of a greater problem with his character—We don't understand his thought process. He seems to be cunning when convenient, and unbelievably stupid when not.Incident after incident reveals his destructive power over Tim's life, and it becomes frustrating rather than funny that Tim, a man of some intelligence, is incapable of ridding himself of him. And it's not just his love life. Through Barry's aid he is repeatedly put in jeopardy of losing favor with the man that warranted him the promotion in the first place. Getting rid of Barry, by force if necessary, is the omnipresent, painfully obvious answer to each tiresome dilemma.Then again, who knows. It's difficult to predict the impact a full, laughing audience would have had on my opinion. I don't think ""Dinner for Schmucks"" is an especially bad film as it stands—Just a languidly average one. Based not on humor, but originality, this localized remake of the French film, ""The Dinner Game,"" carries little merit. It doesn't live up to its premise, and like Barry himself, quickly overstays its welcome.It's hapless, formulaic comedy with all the creativity of a targeting computer. And you don't need one of those to blow up the death-star.",Dinner for Schmucks
84,thekyles99,"Attention to both Carell and Rudd, please do not work with Jay Roach anymore!!",2,4 December 2010,"Wow My first disappointment starring both Steve Carell and Paul Rudd. I was saying during my last review of Date Night, also the last movie i saw Carell in that I have yet to see him anything sucky, well the old saying goes...never say never! This should have been hilarious and was short on laughs. A majority of laughs were anytime Zack Galifianakis was on screen. Carell plays an complete imbecile character that at times in stead of laughing i actually was tempted to punch the screen! A word to director Jay Roach if you are going to have the so called idiot in your film be so annoying that half the audience would rather leave then see do well in the film its time to rethink things before sending out the end product. Carell and Rudd are two of my most favourite of the comedic actors out there these days so i am going to blame both the screen writers and the director on this one. Tim (Paul Rudd) is a budding executive who happens to be at the right place at the right time during one of his company meetings that has the ever so hard to please boss Lance Fender (Bruce Greenwood) actually liking his pitch so much that he asks him to attend a dinner where they are to find the most eccentric and crazy person (ok a loser if you will) that they can as to which himself along with the major bigwigs of the firm can laugh at them only they have to be so much of a loser that they do not really catch on that they are being roasted not toasted. Now this storyline we have seen a thousand times before that puts a major idiot in the way of a successful individual's career path only to have him totally mess things up for the individual and in the end the person sees the error in his behaviour and they end up being best of buds right? Well like i said any movie that makes you want to strangle the lovable idiot instead of saying awwwww, is pushing the wrong point. Watch it you will see what i mean.",Dinner for Schmucks
85,Gideon24,What were Rudd and Carell thinking?,3,12 December 2015,"Dinner for Schmucks is a rambling, overlong, and unfunny comedy that is even worse than its title implies.This pointless 2010 comedy stars Paul Rudd as Tim, a business executive who is promised a promotion if he brings the right person to a monthly dinner held by his boss, where his employees are instructed to bring the biggest idiot they can find so that they can make fun of the dumbest guest and actually give him a trophy as the evening's biggest idiot. Tim accidentally meets Barry (Steve Carell), a nerd who is into mouse taxidermy and before he actually goes to the dinner, ends up methodically destroying Tim's life, primarily by ruining his relationship with his girlfriend (Stephanie Szostak) by bringing a crazed stalker named Darla (Lucy Punch) into his life and messing up an important business dinner with clients from Switzerland.Despite my opening remark about this movie, it was the title of the film that initially attracted me to this film but I learned you definitely can't judge a film by its cover. Let's start with a rambling screenplay that's all over the place and tries to cover so much ground that interest cannot be sustained for the film's unbelievably ridiculous running time. The section of the film where Barry ruins Tim's life just goes on way too long and has nothing to do with the original premise of the film. The story going straight from Barry and Tim's meeting straight to the dinner of the title might have been a good idea, but this part of the movie is just as ridiculous as the rest of it, adding a layer of mean-spiritedness to the boredom and stupidity that set in 45 minutes ago.Jay Roach's direction is as all over the place as the screenplay and the performances aren't much better. Rudd and Carell are fighting the script all the way and Punch is over the top as Darla as is Jemaine Clement as an eccentric artist who has the hots for Tim's girlfriend. As much as I love Paul Rudd and Steve Carell, this movie is a mess. Jay Roach had much better luck a decade earlier with Meet the Parents.",Dinner for Schmucks

87,priyantha-bandara,Can laugh a lot,7,26 January 2011,"If you expect to look at something and then laugh then you have come to the right place. ""Dinner for Schmucks"" has comedy written all over its face and there is a good load of it. Bit of a tricky plot to write about in one line but let me try. Tim is a rising corporate executive who is looking for his next big break and he bumps in to Barry who is an idiot (With a good heart) and lucky for Tim as he was already in the process of looking for an idiot to be presented in their big corporate dinner which is all about ridiculing an idiot! Got confused? Damn I'm good.Tim is played by Paul Rudd (I love you Man, Role Models) and Barry is played by Steve Carrel ( 40 year old virgin, Dan in real life). No need to mention they both are pretty good at what they do. Specially Steve Carrel pulls off the character very well. (Love the scene where he imitates the Swiss accent) This movie is not a masterpiece in comedies but it will make you laugh. And maybe make you a little sad too in several scenes. And make you a dreamer and give you some inspirational advice before it ends. Most of the critic seems to be really disliking this movie. But for me I'm not a pro critic but I'm happy. Didn't expect Shakespeare out it. And oh yes there are some really creative and sweet miniatures all over the movie from start to end as Barry is a miniature creator. You may like those as well.

88,Bravesfan17,Carell shines in a very funny movie,8,14 August 2010,"From director Jay Roach (Meet the Parents, Austin Powers) comes a new comedy called Dinner for Schmucks, starring Steve Carell and Paul Rudd. Rudd stars as Tim, a stockbroker who is given a chance to show his bosses what he is worth after a business proposal. His bosses tell him about the dinner they hold for ""extraordinary people"". Then he runs into Barry (Carell). Barry's hobby is that he makes works of art with the characters made from stuffed mice. Immediately, Tim invites him to dinner.However, Barry becomes even more involved in Tim's life prior to the dinner. Barry tries to help Tim out with his life, when it causes more trouble for Tim.Carell shines in the part of Barry. He is very funny and believable in this role. Carell's parts get the most laughs out of the movie.Rudd does some fine work as Tim. However, he does not show as much range as a comedy actor here compared to his part in I Love You, Man.A hilarious supporting player is Zach Galifianakis (Alan from The Hangover) as Therman, a co-worker of Barry's who also is sleeping with Barry's ex-wife.Another hilarious supporting player is Lucy Punch as Darla, an old flame who Tim slept with and is a crazy stalker who has been wanting more since.Roach focuses most of the movie on Rudd's character and his dilemmas. But Carell is the one who shines in this movie as this performance of his is right up there with his other great performances as a comedy actor.At times the story feels like it may go a bit off focus, but that doesn't stop this from being a very funny movie.",Dinner for Schmucks
89,Jonathon_Natsis,More like Breakfast of Champions!,7,1 February 2011,"An Americanised remake of the French comedy Le Diner De Cons (1998), Dinner For Schmucks puts together an admirable cast of comics, including Paul Rudd, Steve Carell, Jemaine Clement (of Flight Of The Concords fame) and Zach Galifianakis. I understand that his star is growing rapidly, but his name is just too hard to type, so for the rest of this article he will be 'Fat Jesus.' Nonetheless, this film delivers laughs and emotion in satisfying doses, and something I would definitely recommend.Paul Rudd plays Tim, who works a nothing job in Generic Financial Firm #17, until his superiors offer him the chance at a promotion. The catch? He must impress at a dinner hosted by his boss, at which all employees must bring along the most idiotic guest they can find in the hope of taking out first prize. Enter Steve Carell's Barry, IRS employee and amateur taxidermist, whose unique 'skill' with turning dead mice into works of art makes him the perfect candidate. Also circling the plot is Tim's diminishing relationship with girlfriend Julie, who no longer has feelings for the corporate drone Tim has become.The acting is competent overall, but two performances stand out and really give this film a kick. Clement seems to take great pride in his character: a pretentious artist whose hobbies include tantric sex and living amongst goats. In fact, his character is reminiscent of Russell Brand as Aldous Snow (Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Get Him To The Greek), but Clement comes right out of left field with excellent line delivery and tone, coupled with some fantastic physical comedy.Paul Rudd may receive top billing, but make no mistakeSteve Carell drives this film. Just about every line that comes out of Barry's mouth is gold, and a testament to the effort put into the screenplay. But it is the dimension, as opposed to just the humour, of Barry's character that makes him so engaging. He invokes real sympathy in a couple of emotional scenes that prove him to be much more than just a 'schmuck.' And his absurdist chemistry with Fat Jesus during the climactic scene is nothing short of hilarious.As soppy as it sounds, the film drives home a nice moral about how all people, regardless of hobby or intellect, all crave the same feelings of friendship and compassion in their lives. One scene in which Barry effectively questions all that he has achieved in his life is particularly heart wrenching and although it sets the foundation for an admittedly cliché ending, it is pleasing to see a film that markets itself as a first-string comedy still putting emphasis on genuine affection and character.When using a number system to rate films for as long as I have, one begins to develop a conscious idea about what number represents certain films. In my book, anything ranked at eight or above typically constitutes either a classic, or a film I think will be looked upon as a classic in the next twenty years. Dinner For Schmucks dosen't rank quite so high, but it puts up a great fight.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*",Dinner for Schmucks
90,chelano,Steve Carell is pretty funny in this film,6,3 August 2010,"OK there is only one thing that makes this movie and it was Steve Carell. In this film he got to act really strange like his character Brick from Anchorman. His awkwardness and easy to remember one liners will have you laughing through most of the film. Two other actors do really stick out. Zach Galifianakis is also pretty funny, but on certain parts. A few scenes really had me laughing with him, but others were just OK. Jemaine Clement had a character that was really funny and every time he talked, I couldn't help but laugh. Now Paul Rudd had more of a serious part. He had a few funny scenes, but I wanted more. I didn't really care for him in this serious role. Stephanie Szostak had too many close up scenes of her talking and it really bugged me. There are many other small characters and they were just OK in my book. Ron Livingston was in the film, but did not have a big part. I wish he did because I wanted to see more of him. This movie ran about 2 hours long and that is too long for a comedy. Because of this, they tried to make a decent story and had some serious scenes. To me, that failed. They could of left a lot out and made the movie around an hour and a half. So overall, a decent comedy and will defiantly have scenes to talk about. But as for best comedy of the year. Sorry, it didn't cut it.",Dinner for Schmucks

Let's also hope this isn't a sign of things to come for Jermaine Clement, whose cult television hit Flight Of The Conchords is in a completely different league to this offering.Dinner For Schmucks has somehow managed to be worse than any fan of the original could possibly have feared when the remake was announced.

The film is remarkably ""unfunny"" Didn't the marketing geniuses knew that we were going to find out. Were they just trying to make a killing at the box office for the opening week end? Knowing that this thing couldn't possibly have legs, presumably that was the strategy but, I think that if they had been more honest about what they were selling, the movie could have more of a chance with a knowing audience. How infuriating! I saw it at the great Arclight theaters in Hollywood, a full house with only scattered giggles every so often. I must confess I don't get Steve Carrell. A comic genius? A comic wonder? Please! When we finally get to the actual dinner, the premise gets contradicted immediately and the whole thing becomes a total confusing mess.

A poster child for so much of what is wrong with Hollywood comedies. First of all, it's a copy of a French movie, so you already know that the French movie is better. The telltale sign of how bad this movie will be is in the first 10 minutes. There is the typical all bad corporate president in a cliche meeting that doesn't seem believable, you have seen this 100 times before. ..the jerk mistreats people and has some cronies that are also equally juvenile. The difference between this Hollywood comedy of idiots and a foreign version of it is that Hollywood doesn't know how to create characters that are ""gray"" and interesting. That is, Hollywood beats you over the head with a guy who has the black hat on and is just a caricature of ""bad"".

95,C-Younkin,Laughing at the mentally ill,4,28 July 2010,"So now we have a movie that wants us to laugh at the disabled. Can this year get more depressing? ""Dinner for Schmucks"" is a painful remake of French film ""The Dinner Game"". Steve Carell plays Barry, a taxidermist who likes to present dioramas of dead mice. Tim (Paul Rudd) needs to bring an idiot to his boss' dinner of laughing at idiots and Barry fits the bill. Before that even starts, Barry sets off a wave of destruction that is at best smirk-worthy, at worst just plain dumb. From Barry's doing, Tim's apartment and relationship with his girlfriend (Stephanie Szostack, playing an art dealer working with a guy who seems to be ripping off Russell Brand's Aldous Snow) are ruined, a crazy ex (Lucy Punch) is back on his tail, and the IRS wants to audit him. This was all done accidentally, of course, because Barry is really just a simple-minded guy. In all honesty though, the guy is mentally ill. He shouts when he talks, has no idea what to do with a woman (he even tried to find his ex-wife's clitoris under the sofa), he takes the phrase ""stay in the chair"" literally, and he lets himself be swayed by the ""mind-control"" of his equally-mentally ill boss (Zach Galifianakis). Tim meanwhile is made to look like a jerk even though the movie claims he's a nice guy, and yet, there is nothing likable about Tim, nor is Barry-the-manchild anything but a destructive force. Director Jay Roach has the unenviable task of turning this into a sweet buddy comedy but in the end, you just want Tim and Barry to get away from one another. And then comes the dinner, where the blind and other disabled people are ridiculed. That ""Schmucks"" claims to be a ""good-natured"" comedy is really the biggest laugh here.",Dinner for Schmucks
96,moviemaniac008,Go see it,8,10 August 2010,"First off, I heard that the original French film is a classic, but I have never seen it so I cannot and will not compare this movie to the original. All I can say is that I walked in expecting a laugh out loud comedy and I came out with a huge smile on my face, ready to see it twice, which is something that rarely happens in movies when I see them at the theatres. This is a really funny movie that can't compare with other funny movies like the Hangover, but is certainly a lot better than all the ''comedies'' we're used to see in the theatre nowadays.Good points: The humour is almost non-stop, and I was surprised to see that the whole theatre was laughing. Not one person seemed unhappy, not one person didn't laugh, clap or smile. The chemistry between Paul Rudd and Steve Carell is solid. Speaking of Carell, to my eyes, he totally owned the film. His character got the most laughs. I loved Steve Carell in this film. And a few appearances by Zach Galifianakis (a.k.a Allan from the Hangover) were hilarious. A solid script kept the laughs coming, and that's just what you expect from a comedy like this.Cons: Some characters were just underdeveloped, used too much, not seen enough or had nothing to do at all with the story. Andrea Savage could have been used a lot more than two scenes since she's part of the office, Lucy Punch was used too much for what her character could do with the story. Zack Galifianikis could have been used a lot more.All in all, just shut your brain off and watch this film....you'll have a good time",Dinner for Schmucks

Those movies may be winners, but this movie is a winner too. Other movies can be winners. Not just the winners.This movie deserves a 6.5 rating not the current 5.9. At IMDb, a 7.0 is really really good, an 8.0 is a super great magnificent blockbuster. Higher is almost unheard of. But they do exist. Higher rated movies are almost always a sure bet to be a winner. But any movie in the 6's is usually worth watching, while any movie in the 5's is probably pretty okay. Even some movies in the 4's can be okay, so the movies in the 5's are even more okay.

I just stumbled upon it and even though it wasn't reviewed well, I liked the premise. I wasn't expecting much, but I thought I was going to get at least a little something from it. This movie takes a funny premise and essentially takes the least funny angle on every element within the movie with an over the top cartoonishly silly approach. It's a premise that needs to be treated with an element of realism that ties into the reality we are familiar with as a result jokes would land harder and overall it would be a more enjoyable experience. This movie gives us nothing that is relatable to our world. You couldn't try to make this movie any less funny. This movie should be rated much lower than a 5.9 on IMDb. The vast majority of the humor in this movie is sooooo cringe worthy unfunny. Sure, there are a few moments that made me laugh, but if you throw enough crap at the wall some of it's bound to stick, but it's amazing how little does. The whole storyline associated with that art dude was sooooo insanely unfunny on every level. Steve Carrell's/Barry's big theme to his character is, he creates art with dead mice. He uses the mice to depict famous/historical people (Benjamin franklin, Jesus, etc). Seriously! That's the funniest thing they could come up with? I mean 1/5th of the movie is dedicated to this mouse joke. I guess it's a joke? What were they thinking? The whole girlfriend/relationship storyline was painfully cliché and beyond cringeworthy and of course is consistent with being over the top silly. And the whole ex-girlfriend or whatever she was. Seriously? Oye Vey! The Swedish couple. redic! Then the move finally gets to the dinner and makes the audience suspend disbelief. We're supposed to believe that all the business big wigs were really enamored with Barry's weirdness as though he was a huge riot, but none of it occurred while we were watching it. He really wasn't that weird in comparison to the others and his big display with the mice wasn't really that bizarre or funny? Who knows, I'm done?

104,Legendary_Badass,Movie for Schmucks,4,30 July 2010,"In Dinner for Schmucks Paul Rudd is Tim, a man ready to seize an opportunity. The firm he works at as an analyst has a newly vacant office on the highly regarded 7th floor. Tim proposes a scheme to land a lucrative client and the boss approves, but before he can gain access to his new office Tim must first bring a guest to dinner. They call it ""The Dinner for Winners"", but the truth is it's a competition to please the boss by bringing in tow the biggest idiot of the show. Fortunate for Tim he literally ran into Barry (Steve Carrell), a tax collector who dabbles in constructing dioramas for deceased mice. Despite his girlfriend's disapproval, Tim invites Barry to the party and soon discovers that this escapade may be more than he can handle.I can think of numerous strikes that derail this lamebrain comedy. To start the hate spree I have to say that Steve Carrell is not the comedian for the job. I've seen him in top form in Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy and The Daily Show, even a strong showing earlier this year in Date Night. In each of these he played a distinctly different character but none of them as talkatively annoying as Barry. Brick Tamland is almost certainly dumber, but the delivery for that character had a charming naive quality. Barry is more along the lines of Harry and Lloyd's dumbest friend—brash, aggravating, and difficult to believe.For a movie with a sense of reality to it, there are just too many impossibly stupid characters. Darla (Lucy Punch) is Tim's stalker. Her inspiration for scary comes from Lady Gaga. Jemaine Clement plays an artist who spouts all the typical spiritual baloney seen only in a sitcom guest appearance.If a strong title describes the movie it's trying to promote, then Dinner for Schmucks is as weak as Uri Geller's spoons. I would assume we would be spending a great deal of time at a dinner setting. That's not the most original activity for a film but it isn't recycled as often as the road trip across America either. In actuality there is more time spent talking about the dinner taking place the next day than there is both traveling towards or eating at the title location.Director Jay Roach has burst some sides with the Austin Powers trilogy and Meet the Parents. Unfortunately there is a lack of inspiration in this go around. Everything from the music to the camera work screams par without an effort for more. There isn't a standout moment and I'm uncertain how much of this pertains to the fact that Dinner for Schmucks is a remake of a 1998 French film. In 12 years a lot can become cliché.There is a blatant moral to the tale clearly telling us to treat others with respect and the route taken to get there is as obvious as a stoplight. A comedy featuring grown men, which deals with business and relationships, doesn't sound like the appropriate venue for a message this elementary. This is a lesson children learn from Sesame Street, and I doubt adults need the refresher. *½",Dinner for Schmucks

Can't we just laugh? Can't we just be stupid with our humor and not stop? Look at the modern day classics.....""Dumb and Dumber"", ""Billy Madison"".....hell, even Seinfeld. Why are they held up as the greats of our time? It's because they want to make you laugh, not make you feel sorry. Hopefull Paul Rudd and Steve Carell can keep that hope alive.Well I'm sorry to say that this movie fell victim the very thing i just described. It started out mildly funny. There were some sequences that had me lightly chuckling to myself. But as the movie went on, it made you laugh harder and harder. Then i started to think, ""Okay, maybe this movie was just building character, now the movie is really going to get funny."" But that's where i was wrong. Right at the point when i thought it was going to start getting good, it got really really sad. I mean, really sad. Which is really confusing for an audience, because after that, you don't know if they actually trying to be funny, or emotional. So in turn, you just have a lot of raised eyebrows.And that really is a shame. Because the overall idea for this movie is great, granted that it is a remake. But still, there are endless possibilities with this idea. And rather than focus on the dinner portion (Which could have been so much more), they only give it a 15 minutes sequence out of a near 2 hour movie. I guess they had to sum it up because i think they needed to add a little more emotional depth to the story.Bottom Line......when the movie is funny, it's really funny.

Barry, which is Steve Carell's eccentric and lonely character, is unfortunately too unlikeable. If his character would of been less of an oddball and more realistic, then maybe you would have something here. Since this is not the case, the movie is painful to watch and memorable for the wrong reasons.While watching this, I couldn't help but finding similarities to Michel Gondry or Wes Anderson . Maybe it has to do with some music choices that sound almost like a score made by John Brion and certain weird elements, such as the mice photography.The film tries hard in getting you more involved with Barry, but fails in that as well.

Barry's defining qualities are shallow and outlandish, and the very traits that make him desirable for the party are the ones that lead to him unintentionally tearing Tim's life apart from the inside. The movie is a series of disjointed scenes centered around social ineptitude, easily solved misunderstandings, and characters with few redeeming qualities that are hard to empathize with. It feels as if the one-line concept was approved and then never developed further, and somehow reached fruition without anyone realizing how flat and meandering the plot was. Jay Roach, the director, did direct Austin Powers, so his heavy-handed slapstick humor is consistent with his brand. However, where the plot content and vibrant characters keep the Austin Powers films interesting, this film lacked the integral qualities to balance out the lackluster style of execution. The amount of ground covered feels more like an episode in a sit-com rather than a full-length feature movie, and is in my opinion, a smudge (if not a blemish) on Paul Rudd and Steve Carell's careers.",Dinner for Schmucks
109,anchoreddown,Carrell scores again!,7,7 August 2010,"Since the announcement of Steve Carrell's final season at The Office, I'm sure most of his fans are wondering what is next.Dinner For Schumucks is crude in its own way. Knowing the way these kinds of movies play out, the producers will often push the envelope out into the open several times just to get the laughs going. The general audiences will feel shocked by this, but yet in this day in age, acceptable for people who have no taste for movies what-so-ever and are sick enough to want to see this kind of crap.As far as the storyline goes, this is something you've seen before. The characters are put under pressure to the limit that they sometimes snap. People who write comedies now-a-days know this is a format that can be used to cram in as many jokes as possible seeing that nothing is sacred. Steve Carrell, in this case is a walking time bomb ready to go off any minute.So far on the review board, there hasn't been much praise for this film considering it's only been out for a week. However, if you really want to see this movie, you must disregard everything negative about it as described in the before.In my honest opinion, many of the most underrated movies on IMDb for Yahoo are usually quite good. I never listen to critics.This movie has a good chance at possibly becoming the summer 2010 sleeper that may come out in the rankings for best comedies of this year.",Dinner for Schmucks
110,GLanoue,Bad and boring,5,10 February 2011,"This Steve Carell vehicle just can't pull off the charm of the original French movie. What worked in the original was, ironically from an American anto-French perspective, the French class system. Every European knows that their local status games keep good people down and exalt idiots. The Carell character in the French original (the late and lamented Jacques Villeret) was not that dumb, not that stupid, and not that unsympathetic. He was just a schmuck trapped by his unfortunate appearance and by his social lower middle class destiny, to be working for the Fisc (IRS) and gluing together miniature models from toothpicks as a hobby and especially as an antidote to his boring and uneventful life. In the remake, because Americans usually don't get this aspect of Europe, people's fates have to be the result of their psychological makeup or of their lack of talent or brains (well, talent, since few people with brains are exalted by Hollywood flix). So, Carell as a schmuck has to be totally unsympathetic, and his nemesis has to have some warm feelings (which were virtually absent in the original). It has to come down to character and not society. It means that it's hard to be funny, warm and human in the circumstances, since it would be, literally, out of character, and in the end we can't identify with Carell except as a pathetic everyman underdog. Original director Francis Weber had a lot more to work with, so here Carell is given almost no redeeming qualities whatsoever (it's really not a spoiler, but the crazy credits at the end have him laughing at Fender's misfortunes; I won't say more, but it's mean spirited, while the original was not). Also, the whole subplot with Carell's ex now in the hands of his boss is completely mishandled. I for one was relieved that she left the jerk, albeit for another of the same ilk. The actual dinner scene is pretty funny and redeems some aspects of this movie, but that's because the other schmucks were given free rein to let loose, and they do. The animal medium lady is a hoot and worth at least three stars on her own, and the blind swordsman gets one as well. Still, it's a poor movie when the stars can't carry it and depend on five minute cameos by B-list character actors.",Dinner for Schmucks
111,matty_mushroom1983,6 stars to Steve Carrell alone.,6,23 April 2016,"I'm tired. I've had a long week at work, I want to ""chill out"", get hungry and watch something stupid. So I read the synopsis for Dinner For Schmucks and it sounds promising. Literally nothing interesting happened until Steve Carrell showed up. Some predictable gags and a template setup for the inevitable hilarity that will ensue. Tim wants promotion, his bosses are elitist douche bags, he wants to fit in and be successful, he's willing to do just about anything, even if he has to be cruel. His girlfriend works with an intimate weirdo, he has a stalker from the past, he has to impress ridiculously rich European people to he his evil promotion and he even learns a valuable lesson in the end. Hey, they're not spoilers, that's a stock standard plot. If the plot surprises you, id say you're very sheltered. NOTHING interesting happened while ever Steve Carrell isn't around. Carrell's given his script, told to do what he does best and he shows his true comic worth as creator of unbelievably mentally challenged characters. Every positive credit that can be given to this flick is purely due to the performance of Steve Carrell. If I can't enjoy a supposed comedy flick AT ALL when I'm high, there's something wrong.Steve Carrell saves this one",Dinner for Schmucks
112,unemployedvirgin,A Man & His Mice...,9,25 May 2011,"Having just watched the film i had to jump on here real quick to share my thoughts. Dinner For Schmucks has a new breed of hilarity that i'm proud to be an observer of. Choice of casting was great from the familiar yet ancient ""Friend's"" leading man to the Little Britian co-star.A Brilliant build up to a warm fuzzy finish, it has the animated craziness of a Disney film mixed with real life yet so off the wall characters that you have to love them, it's hard not to. Some funny quotes and 1 liners to be stored in the memory bank, along with an easy going soundtrack is too good to be true.The only reason i gave this picture a 9 was because i was hoping for just a little more R rated content, but regardless of having no explicit Tits & Ass this is definitely worth watching, i highly recommend it.

116,carljessieson,Hilarious!,8,6 September 2010,"I went into this movie with high expectations, and I was not disappointed.Paul Rudd is okay. He's cute, he has funny facial expressions, a nice voice. He was funny, yeah. But the real star of this movie is only Steve Carell. Oh my goodness, I cannot believe someone can be so hilarious. He had his character, Barry, completely mastered. Brilliant! Barry is this adorable, little geeky guy that is completely socially inept, and Carell acted out every single one. I forgot about every other role that I saw him play. I really lost the actor in this character, which is sometimes difficult to find in a comedy these days when most characters are generic.I laughed non-stop for most of the movie. When I wasn't laughing, it was because it was a serious moment. First of all, the jokes were great. They were new and made me laugh embarrassingly loud in the theater. I had a great time watching this movie. The emotional side of the film, however, was a bit much. It was okay for Barry's situation, like it was understandable and at a good amount, but for Paul Rudd's character, it was too much for me. I didn't like his situation; it was just too familiar, I've seen it before in other movies. That was the only disappointment in the movie. Maybe it's just me though, but I very rarely like the conflicts in comedies. They all seem the same and they seem like they only erupt from oversensitive, supporting characters that I don't want to hear from. It is probably just me, because of the mindset I have when I approach the movie. I go in expecting just a bunch of laughs, so when something serious happens I don't want it. That's my own problem.So, yep. I loved this movie. I thought it was extremely funny, I liked the story. I loved Barry and most other characters. I laughed a LOT and I left the theater smiling. On the drive home, scenes from the movie popped up in my head and I laughed about them all over again. I will definitely buy this movie, no doubt. It's a really good time.",Dinner for Schmucks

I guess I can see why some people didn't like it, but I guess I can also see why it's ranked a solid 6.0.First, I love Steve Carrell, so keep that in mind as I review this title. Second, I usually enjoy re-makes, especially comedies.Even though there were some serious themes and events, this movie was by no means plot driven. No, this movie was given life by well-timed humor. This isn't always a good thing, though, as you are bound to run into people who simply don't find the dialogue and characters funny. As I stated before, I find essentially all of Steve Carrell's work hilarious, so that helped get me through some of the bizarre portions of the film. I think there was a distinct limit as to how good this movie was going to be, and I believe they almost reached that maximum. Problem is, the writing tried to please too many types of people. There was just too many different types of humor and no underlining theme.",Dinner for Schmucks
118,dirtphelia,One of the worst movies ever. A disgrace to the original French movie.,1,9 June 2012,"It's not just that it's a completely awful adaptation, it's that it's an extremely BAD movie. I didn't watch this movie to compare it to the original, I really just wanted to watch the American version, after all the American version of ""The Birdcage"" was great. However, this movie is just plain crap! The original movie is funny because it's smart but the people who put this horrible fart of a movie together seem to have relied on the assumption that viewers would be either extremely drunk or superbly stupid to exude even a mediocre giggle.I can't even finish watching this thing but it looks like the makers adapted what they thought were the best scenes from original and threw in some ridiculous scenes of their own without providing any material to connect or justify it all.Really, total crap! It looks like the whole production was slapped together with the minimum amount of effort possibly required. Even Paul Rudd's acting is sloppy at many points. His character, Tim, is inconsistent throughout and the casting for his secretary is just awful. I just don't see what is funny about that bland woman. So many talented actors out there, it doesn't take much to select someone half-decent.Some of the worst scenes: it makes no sense that Tim was able to spot an idiot if he'd never had to spot one before. The scene where Darla the stalker goes to Tim's apartment is just plain stupid. And when Barry & Tim go to the artist's apartment, c'mon! The artist doesn't even ask how they got in, just acts as if they've run into one another in the street.I wonder if Rudd's and Carell's careers are already on the decline for them to accept doing such a terribly awful movie. And what's happening in Hollywood? Gotta stop hiring each other's friends and get some talented people to write scripts. There's NO shortage of writers in this world, the industry can do better if it wants.",Dinner for Schmucks
119,jimchudnow-1,ATTENDANCE at this Dinner is MANDATORY for Comedy Lovers,9,7 July 2010,"""DINNER FOR SCHMUCKS"" MPAA Rating: PG-13 MY rating: 9 stars (of a possible 10, based on an advance screening).In 1998, Francis Veber wrote & directed a French farce called ""The Dinner Game (Le diner de cons)"". This film is called an ""adaptation"" of that idea, & I found it exceptionally funny and well-done: ... Tim (played by PAUL RUDD) is an eager-beaver at a ""rodent-infested"" Financial advisory firm filled with RATS who tend to back-stab anyone that might affect their future income. His boss at the Fender company (BRUCE GREENWOOD) enjoys playing with peoples' lives and putting-down the many ""lesser"" creatures he finds scurrying around his rich-mens' world. To try to win a highly-coveted promotion which he feels will entice his love Julie (STEPHANIE SZOSTACK) to finally accept his marriage proposal, Paul tells Bruce his idea to try to win-over a rich new Swiss client named Müeller (DAVID WALLIAMS)  Before he agrees that's a good idea, Bruce wants Paul to further ""PROVE"" himself worthy of an upper-level job by attending a dinner in which he brings a guest that will impress the others as being the biggest IDIOT (schmuck) at the gathering. In other words, he & his cohorts want people they can make FUN of in their superior way, & the guy who brings the biggest ""loser"" to the dinner will be the biggest ""WINNER"" of the evening (& thus likely to ""move on up"" at the company)  Paul chances to ""run across"" a very ECCENTRIC IRS employee named Barry (STEVE CARELL) whose hobby is creating fanciful human-like diorama / vignettes utilizing taxidermied MICE posed in charming but strange ways  His girlfriend Julie wants to ""curate"" shows for outlandish artist Kieran Vollard (JEMAINE CLEMENT), & she is very much TURNED-OFF by the idea that Paul would stoop so low as to trick someone (namely, Steve) to attend the planned dinner at Bruce's  Paul finds that, while Steve is sort of ""RIGHT"" for being his guest at Bruce's party, he's not just off-center but decidedly WACKY in the ways he often goes about things in life. Steve (with no malice intended) chances to facilitate Paul's being STALKED by a violent ex-lover named Darla (LUCY PUNCH), which causes additional upsets in Paul's relationship with Stephanie (especially when Steve chances to get Paul involved with artist Jemaine)  Various other nutty characters enter the picture, such as Steve's IRS boss, ""Mind-control"" guru Therman (ZACH GALIFIANAKIS), additional kinky guests brought to Bruce's dinner by other company employees, etc. There's an inspired NUTTINESS to it all, both during the main film & in a number of ""postscript"" comments ""updating"" you on things as the CREDITS roll. Unlike so many other American comedies nowadays, this one is NOT rife with constant sexual activity or gross-out comments. I found it to be a wonderfully well-played whimsical ""commentary"" on the ""unusual"" characters we at times meet upon life's journey  Rather than being filled with ""clever"" lines, it's more of a ""slice-of-life"" character-&-situation-driven hilarity, with exceptional performances by Steve (who has a ""sweetness"" to his goofiness) & Paul (who does another masterful job playing an understated ""straight-man"" as he did in ""I Love You, Man""), with fine and funny work by those in the supporting cast  A number of people might find the whole story ""silly"". But, I found it an often-brilliant piece of ensemble comic work, and I both enjoyed & respected the success in which they ""pulled-off"" the achievement",Dinner for Schmucks
120,mannin11,Enough to make one weep with despair,2,30 July 2010,"How come the writers weren't invited to this dinner? If you ever wondered when Hollywood would scrape the bottom of the barrel in terms of remakes then believe it or not, that day has arrived. The original French version was so sublime in its high comedy and fast pace one knew it would be a hard act to follow. With two likable and talented actors like Steve Carell and Paul Rudd at the helm one hoped that the American remake wouldn't be a complete disaster. Alas, alas whatever committee was responsible for the script has destroyed every bit of wit and finesse contained in the original. What one has instead is a runaway train wreck of slapstick that congeals on the screen in an endless series of tiresome and unnecessary complications that are just too dumb to be funny. The Three Stooges at their worst are better than this movie at its best. One has to wonder at the ages of the people who wrote this script. Was it written in a locker room by a bunch of sniggering teens? A lot of talented actors are woefully wasted in this mess. Sad to say but this is just another example of the Last Airbender mentality at work: ""Let's just throw more money into the project and hope something worthwhile emerges"". The source material offered so much potential for a remake but the results are dire indeed. Kudos to the actors for a valiant attempt to kick some life into a rotten fish of a script.",Dinner for Schmucks

122,trixie-k-88,"Annoying, Stupid and Cruel",3,5 April 2012,"Dinner for Schmucks is an insult, to both the actors and audience. I felt nothing but negative feelings and disdain toward all the characters.Tim (Paul Rudd) is a guy working in crappy office job who is looking to climb the corporate ladder. The opportunity rises when he comes up with a clever idea and is asked to a dinner with a foreign businessman. The catch is that he must bring a ""fool"" to the dinner like everyone else is. The point of the party is for everyone to make a spectacle of their own ""fool"", and at the end of the night the dumbest and strangest guest gets a prize. While he is at first alarmed at the idea of this party, Tim instead starts thinking about proposing to his girlfriend Julie (Stephanie Szostak). As his luck would have it, Tim stumbles upon Barry (Steve Carell), a strange man who collects dead mice and creates dioramas with them. Tim befriends Barry and brings him to his apartment, where Barry begins to mess up his relationship with Julie, let his stalker-ex Darla (Lucy Punch) know where he lives, and even jeopardizes his career. Barry drives Tim crazy, but the night of the fateful dinner party arrives and they encounter a strange array of people including a woman who talks to dead animals, a man married to a ventriloquist dummy, and a ""mind control"" expert (Zach Galifianakis).To sum it up, this movie is annoying and mean. It's got the air of a ""What About Bob"" movie where one exceedingly annoying character destroys the life of some average guy. There is literally nothing likable about Barry, and at best you will sometimes feel pity for how people treat him. Tim is also hard to relate to because while we are also annoyed by Barry's obnoxiousness, he is being a complete jerk by using and exploiting him. Truly, none of the characters are likable. I'll admit that the dinner itself is kind of funny, but that's about 15 minutes out of an almost two hour movie. While it tries to have the characters redeem themselves by making friends and ""being nice"", it doesn't change the fact this is a movie about how much fun it is to bully people who are different. It reminds me of cruel parties that sororities or fraternities have to bring the nerdiest/ugliest/fattest date. I could even look past that nastiness if this movie was actually good, but it's just not. While I've not seen it, I have heard that the original French film is hilarious, so that's even more pathetic. It's a total waste of good comedic talent like Carell, Rudd, and Galifianakis.

124,dimarinc,"Has Plenty of Laughs, But Lags and Disappoints as Well",6,4 April 2012,"Dinner for Schmucks is a trendy comedy that draws from the formula that 40 year old virgin perfected. It features two stars from that film, and has enough charm and laughs to please. It is longer than it should be, and doesn't walk the line of stupid/silly all that well. Though there are a couple of big names in this movie, Jemaine Clement easily was responsible for half the laughs in this movie. He stole every scene he was in. Steve Carell was funny, but also pushed the silly envelope too hard too often. Paul Rudd was more of the straight line character and had enough charm to carry the main story.This movie was easily 20-30 minutes too long. The ""cameo"" by Zack Galafianakis missed in my opinion. The parts he was in seemed a little to dumb for my taste. I would recommend every comedy fan watch this movie. It also has enough story and charm to carry most casual viewers.

125,jgregg42,"""Dinner for Schmucks"" Only Whets the Appetite.",6,30 July 2010,"""Dinner for Schmucks"" has a clever title but it needed to spend more time on the main course. The audience is subjugated to almost one and a half hours of build up time before the dinner bell rings. It's not time wasted though, the story does make good use of its two hour run time. However, I felt like I was on a plane taxiing down the runway trying to get up enough speed to take off and once in flight the plane kept dipping and then pulling back up; then it finally it made an abrupt landing and the flight was over.We are first introduced to Tim (played by Paul Rudd), an investment analyst, who is presented an opportunity to pounce on a new promotion at work. The story is set up as most business tales are told. The boss has an important client, the main character is presented with a once in a life time opportunity to prove his worth and so on and so forth. While in the process he learns something about himself.The business men (one of whom is played by Ron Livingston from ""Office Space"" fame) are the typical jerks who will do anything to keep on top of the dog pile. In this particular dog pile they also like to pick on the smaller, weaker dogs. It just so happens that the big dogs are having their ""dinner for winners"" in a few days. Tim now has a great chance to prove to his boss he will go to any length to earn the new position. The catch is that he has to find a loser to bring to dinner. They then have a contest, unbeknown to the losers, to see who the biggest schmuck is.Tim finds his loser immediately the next day not by chance but because as Tim so wisely says ""everything happens for a reason"". Welcome aboard, Barry (played by Steve Carell), here the story starts picking up a little steam. Barry has a unique talent of finding the positive in almost any situation, he mispronounces words that any 5th grader knows, works for the IRS and in his spare time works on his ""Mouseterpieces"". A perfect fit for Tim. A ""Mouseterpiece"" is Barry's taxidermy side projects where he takes dead mice and mounts them in familiar historical and everyday scenarios (i.e. The Last Supper, mice having a picnic, Whistler's Mother, etc).A lot of activity happens in that single night before the big dinner; Tim and Barry break into one of Tim's girlfriend's biggest clients' homes and finds him in a weird sexual perversion act. Next Barry accidentally invites Tim's ex-fling, Darla, over to the apartment and the first laugh riot is finally given to the audiences through a funny fight scene between Barry and Darla. Then it is on to the IRS to talk to Barry's boss, Therman (played by Zach Galifianakis), who is also a self proclaimed mind reader. Have you noticed they still haven't made it to the dinner yet? The next day Tim has a brunch appointment with a potential multi million dollar client where Barry and Darla show up trying to smooth things over. Again the straight man, Tim, and goofy man, Barry, routine starts up and we are given another good laugh. It was a pretty easy set up; take a high pressure situation and place it in any restaurant that has a Maitre d' next mix in a socially inept character such as Barry and something funny is bound to happen.After all of this we are finally taken out to dinner. The peculiar thing was that the dinner only lasts 15 minutes. This was a shame because the story could have spent more time on the losers that came to dinner. There was some great talent there, one being Jeff Dunham, a humorous ventriloquist who has been working stand up clubs for the last two decades. It felt like the director (Jay Roach) should have pumped the brakes, slowed up and gave these losers some more screen time. We did get another laugh riot when Therman and Barry had an invisible shoot out between their mind reading capabilities. Then it was over with a nice epilogue to the story through Barry's ""Mouseterpieces"".Should you see this movie? UmmmOK, why not? There were some funny bits to it, the storyline was solid and the comedic actors were funny but didn't have to try too hard for the jokes. Rudd plays a good straight man in these situations where Carell and Galifianakis can play off of him quite easily.",Dinner for Schmucks

Run, Don't Walk, to See This Hilarious Comedy.",7,1 August 2010,"When I saw ""Dinner For Schmucks"" today, the audience was jam-packed and everyone seemed to be having a great time. Box office champion Steve Carrell and his regular second banana, Paul Rudd, along with high-concept comedy director and raunch maestro Jay Roach, combine their trademark sarcastic humor with underlying sensitivity and deep character study, and the result is a crowdpleasing winner.We take innocent but ambitious career-minded stockbroker Tim Conrad (Rudd)who, during a business meeting, sees one colleague fired for losing money in a stock gamble, and he wants to take his place. His boss Lance Fender (a conniving Bruce Greenwood) lets him on the deal, but on one condition: he must attend his dinner and find himself a willing guest who is so perfectly stupid. He refuses to let his sensible regular companion Julie (Stephanie Szostak) know about this, and this all leads to an on-again off-again relationship. Then Julie hooks up with a strange art curator named Kieran (Jermaine Clement), who likes to paint humans with animals hanging off of their bodies.Enter Barry Speck (Carell), a dumbed-out IRS employee with glasses and an overbite who has a fetish for dead mice and dresses them up in costumes or his landscapes. The landscapes with the mice reveal Barry's passages in life. Tim accidentally hits him with his car as Barry is about to pick up a dead mouse. Tim takes him and he and Barry develop a love-hate relationship as the unthinking Barry gets Tim into escapes with a blonde SNM stalker named Darla (the appropriately named Lucy Punch. Yes, that's her real name) and fellow IRS employee Thurman (Zach Galifianakis), who wants to rival Barry with his idiotic mind control tactics. Barry and Thurman hate each other so much and Barry's wife left him for Thurman. Also essential to the cast are David Walliams as a Swiss stock client of Tim's and the beautiful big blue-eyed Lucy Davenport as his exotic wife, who in one funny scene, coax Tim into marrying Darla when Julie was unavailable.Now get to the climactic dinner scene. All the characters and elements build up to the hilarious dinner in a huge mansion where chaos and laughs reign. The humor is funny but the slapstick really is the best at that climax. In the end, Barry gets the top prize against Thurman who wants to outdumb him. All works out everyone predictably in the end.The best thing about this movie is where the characters appear comfortable with themselves. Barry is content with his idiocy. Tim may be a social climber, but he is good hearted in his personal relationships with Barry and Julie. The rest of the cast play cold-blooded types for good measure, but in the end, all the good guys win.",Dinner for Schmucks
131,franciscoraposo72,Unfortunately Very Underrated!,7,29 April 2012,"Let me cut the chase, I do know which movie I'm reviewing, I do give Dinner for Schmucks a 10 out of 10 and I do consider it my 6th favorite movie, let me tell you why. Dinner for Schmucks it's not only a clever, well-acted and hilarious comedy, it's comedy with lots of heart and although it's a bit stupid it's definitely my 6th favorite movie. Jay Roach (The Fockers) did a terrific job with everything. Steve Carell, well, I'll have to write about him on a single paragraph, cause he was just... Paul Rudd was great, he played mature and funny. Zach Galifianakis, well, I'll join him to Steve's paragraph. Sow, Dinner for Schmucks is a terrific movie, it's not for everybody but it is for me, it's a light-hearted hilarious and stupid comedy that I just have re-watched thousands of times and I can't seem to get tired of. The soundtrack by Theodore Shapiro was excellent and gave this movie a certain atmosphere that I just loved 100%, the song ""Fool on the Hill"" (The Beatles) right at the beginning is genius and along the movie goes on you find many appealing themes and then at the credits you here an amazing song from Theodore, overall, I loved the soundtrack. STORY: Tim (Paul Rudd) has a great job and a great girlfriend and they're both in a great place at life. Tim is about to get a new office and an awesome promotion, but first, he'll have to appear at his boss' dinner that he hosts once a month, that dinner consists on every worker bringing an idiot person and the most idiot person of the dinner will win. Tim was definitely not going, but later, he has second thoughts when he accidentally runs over Barry (Steve Carell), a harmless guy who's work is at IRS and who's hobby is to make sets and pictures with dead mice. MY OPINION: The plot was amazing, it was full of hilarious stuff and fun stuff, I loved it. Steve Carell was purely fantastic, his glasses, his teeth and his blonde hair, he was just fantastic and he stole me a bit of oxygen if you know what I mean, Steve was extremely hilarious and no one could play his role better than he did, he was funny and idiot but he played a sweet guy that we all wish to meet, he was unforgettable. Zach Galifianakis was truly genius, his orange ... (I think it's worth being seen without knowing) and his hilarious laugh makes his performance be unique and highly unforgettable. The chemistry between Steve and Zach was fantastic and the scene where they both imaginary fight is a movie classic.Overall, Dinner for Schmucks is my 6th favorite movie without any doubts, it's funny, heart warming, very well-acted, hilarious, entertaining, fun, very well directed, very well written and still, I don't know how is it so much underrated- Highly recommended. Unforgettable comedy. 6th Best Movie of All Time.",Dinner for Schmucks

133,elroy_geronimo,"Don't believe the hype, it's not as bad as they say!!",7,2 December 2010,"Just finished watching ""Dinner for Schmucks"". To me it's a typical rom-com, but there's this weird guy in it that steals the show. I really liked the ""mice""-en-scenes, the ones at the dinner were lame, but the scenes Barry recreated from his marriage were beautiful in an odd way. I liked Steve Carell, as Barry, because surprisingly of all the over the top characters in this movie, he was the most believable and lovable and I'm not a fan. It took me a lot of time to like him in ""The Office"", but thanks to Comedy Central over here in Holland and after a lot of sleepless nights with absolutely nothing else to watch, he kind of grew on me. Zach Galifianakis character was great too, but the only things that had me laughing out loud was some of the slapstick. S o was it a good movie? Yes, enjoyable enough for a Sunday afternoon. I tried to watch the original ""Le dinner du cons"" before I saw this remake but I couldn't stand it, because of the slow pace. Now I have seen the remake and was pleasantly surprised, I just had to watch the original, because everyone keeps saying it's so much better. I used to love Louis de Funes and the Pink Panther movies when I was a boy (and yes I know Clouseau wasn't really French!), so I gave it another go. I was happy to see Jacques Villeret, the sidekick of Louis de Funes in a couple of movies, but I guess that's also the problem. He needs someone else to shine and he didn't really on his own. The dialogs were more tongue in cheek than laugh out loud funny and I really feel sorry for people who think this is the funniest movie ever I was also very disappointed that the actual dinner wasn't in the movie, because I expected the French to outshine the remake in it. So if you like Steve Carell you'll love this movie and as a remake I think it did improve on the original even though they gave it a typical Hollywood ending. If you really want to see a train wreck of a remake, I still think Louis de Funes' ""Oscar"" by Sly Stallone is the worst remake ever!",Dinner for Schmucks
134,theburrus1,"Steve Carell is great in all his movies, but he owned this film!",8,29 December 2013,"Steve Carell is one of my favorite actors, more and more each movie I've seen him in (not in chronological order). Then in looking for another comedy, I saw this one. Then I looked on IMDb and it had a 5.7 rating, slightly low for a film with Carell in it, who by the way is estimated to get $20 million a film these days. Now, I will say all the other characters are fantastic in their roles, but I do not think there was any scene that Carell's character (Barry) was in where he spoke or acted that I could not help but laugh at or just plain crack-up. And that to me is why he is worth what he is paid. Not only is he worth his salary in acting and comedy, but he owned this role like no one else could! And that is brilliant talent. Most likely, if you do watch this film, when it is over you would agree its him that takes this film up two notches from the 5.7 to an 8 stars out of 10.In concluding, the plot and parts of some of the supporting actors' scripts and roles might seem a little quirky or surreal in just reading the synopsis, but actually I found all of those areas of this film entertaining and amusing as well, if you pay attention to subtlety of statements or jokes throughout, but all of this is just the cake. And it is Carell whom, in my opinion, is the icing on that cake!",Dinner for Schmucks
135,skullballmovies,Charming but slightly plagued,7,2 August 2010,"The thought of inviting people to dinner just so you can have a few laughs and make fun of them is extremely cruel, and you may think that that is what the movie is fully about. I can assure you that it isn't. If anything, it's motivating people to act outside of the box, to be themselves. The movie is really fun to watch and I can guarantee you won't regret seeing it. It's funny, it's charming, and it makes you smile. Heck, I smiled through a lot of the movie. However, it does have some bad sides. Like a lot of movies do. It was ridiculous how many bad things were happening to Tim. Also ridiculous that he wasn't acting like a normal human being would. I can tell you that if all of the things that happened to him, happened to me, I would either break down and cry or scream a lot. Or both. Then the more serious parts weren't serious enough. They added too much comedic relief in it and I didn't want that for those scenes. It's a comedy, yeah, but that doesn't mean every minute has to try to be funny. That's how movies get stale and lose your interest. This wasn't stale at all, but it didn't make me crack up. Steve Carell was very natural and a very believable character. He was charming and cool, but dumb as can be. His 'mousterpieces' were outstanding and funny at the same time. Never seen anything like it, probably never will again. Overall, this movie is really enjoyable and you can probably get past the bad parts if you're not a reviewer like me. Check it out if you want to watch an interesting, but at the same time simple, comedy.",Dinner for Schmucks

142,SpaceComics,Best Comedy In Years,10,2 July 2014,"SPOILERS Dinner for Schmucks is one of the best comedies I've seen in recent years, possibly since Austin Powers. It's funny without getting as crude and disgusting as other recent funny comedies like Borat, Team America, Harold & Kumar, and Super Bad. The characters are likable with their funny flaws, and Steve Carell performs his role better than anything I've seen from Adam Sandler, Will Farrell or any of the other current lead comics. Carell plays a not so bright, nerdy amateur taxidermist who makes dioramas featuring stuffed mice. But you like him because he's very talented at his hobby. Paul Rudd befriends him with an ulterior motive, to invite him to the title dinner to impress his boss - but humiliating him in the process. But even before the dinner, Carell, trying to helpful, creates a series of misunderstandings that mess up Rudd's relationships. This makes up the bulk of the movie and is very funny, if typical comedic misunderstandings, well staged with good comic timing. SPOILER: But the dinner finally comes and that's the outstanding part, as we see the schmucks invited really are better people than the snobs who invited them, just ordinary people with some extraordinary talents -- but intensely funny. This is one to watch over again every couple years.",Dinner for Schmucks

145,Oeuvre_Klika,An underrated comedy,7,1 May 2019,"I had always avoided this movie because it is based on a French movie that I consider to be one of the funniest comedies of all time.Now I've seen it, I think many reviews here are very unfair. I see a lot of 1/10, and many of these are from people who are saying that it isn't as good as the original.Is it as good? No, I don't think so. But I it's still a good movie, and I think saying it has no merits whatsoever is a big exaggeration.One important thing to know if you have seen the original ""Le dîner de cons"" is that this movie is not exactly a remake. The beginning credits say ""inspired by"", and it's very true. Sure, you will find some of the same elements, but the writers really made a new story out of the original ideas.I did think this movie had flaws. For one, the beginning was really drawn out. We didn't need to see that much of the backstory before the real fun began. The beginning wasn't very funny and it made me wonder if I had made a mistake in playing this movie.Fortunately, once the story really got started, I was was laughing through and through. The performances are golden, and I think they are what makes this movie, more than the script. I'd particularly single out the two leads, Steve Carrell and Paul Rudd, as well as Jemaine Clements.But I'm not throwing the script under the bus. I loved that it had a lot of heart besides the jokes. They made Paul Rudd's character more sympathetic than in the French movie, and I was sceptical of that at first, but in the end I think it worked very well.Then, unfortunately, the movie suffered again from an ending that was too long and a little too over-the-top. And even after that, we had an epilogue telling us what happened to every single character, and I though that was overkilling it.If you're a fan of Veber's ""Le dîner de cons"", or if you're a fan of any of the actors that appear in this movie, I think you should really give it a chance. It has a good story, with a lot of jokes, and a surprising amount of emotion. But don't just take my word for it, watch it and, as I did today, make your own opinion about it.",Dinner for Schmucks

That being said, they are the worst choices for the roles they attempted to pull off. Paul Rudd was complacent and docile, while Steve Carell was downright unfunny. Zach G and Jemaine Clemente were amazing, they were the best parts of the movie. About half way through, I looked to my friend and asked if we should leave, he said we should stick it out. I attempted to find the highest point in the theater and jump off, but alas, I was stopped by security and forced to finish watching this joke of a film.

But when it comes into real life, it doesn't quite lie up to your hype. Don't get me wrong, Zach in his two scenes is hilarious and Steve Carell, no joke, deserves an Oscar nominee for his performance, but Rudd, without his raunchy humor, falls flat, and the rest of the supporting cast doesn't provide enough laughs or support, and the plot is practicable. All the plot unfolds and the climax is met before dinner even happens. And some parts are either sick or just wrong. Bottom line, to all the people who say this offensive or stupid, calm down. Its meant to be funny. And to all the people who said that this is the funniest movie of all time.. well you have bigger problems. So if you're a fan of the actors, like I am, see the movie, its worth price of admission.

I remember laughing properly about twice through the whole movie. Why? It's stupid, This movie is just really stupid.Its the story of a bland business type character trying to get a promotion by inviting someone much more interesting and confusing to a dinner and winning the dinner for idiots competition. The rest of the plot is as predictable as a Nascar racetrack, as is the amount of low brow humor that for the most part is lacking in laughs, style, class and intelligence. This movie seems to assume its audience is stupid and therefore tries to be as stupid as possible and then, when you don't expect ( I meant expect it) they try to put emotion in to make you feel something? However, this is only one character you can feel for and it is Steve Carell's character. He genuinely has a sad back story which is conveyed in a cunning and emotive way involving mice. Even this though, was not enough to save the movie from large void that it fell in.It had a good cast and some nice concepts, but in the end this movie was nothing to be enjoyed, which is sad because i feel there might have been potential in there somewhere.4/10 stars or, 2/5 stars",Dinner for Schmucks

This movie is no exception! Dinner For Schmucks is a pathetic, moronic and plain just unfunny movie. I rarely walk out of movie theaters but thankfully I didn't watch this crap in one!! The title is already an almost literal translation of the French title. Just replacing the French word 'con' with the Yiddish word 'Schmuck' and you have it- The story has a vague forgettable plot which resembled the original. The characters are NOT funny and therefore don't allow the viewers to identify or even sympathize with them. Once again the golden rule of remakes in Hollywood turns out to be true!!! Having seen the original, highly successful and hilarious French comedy Le dîner de cons written and directed by Francis Veber. Dinner For Schmucks is nothing like it! Steve Carell, who is usually funny and a comedic expert, completely fails at being remotely amusing. Even New Zealand born Jermaine Clement slightly above average performance cannot save this film from disaster. Trust me don't waste your time or money on this movie!!

I thought to myself, considering it wasn't funny it would be better if it was a serious drama, like carrel had a break down because his wife left him and Rudd tries to help rebuild his life or something; there are very few parts were you'll laugh and they are all on the trailers...

The story has a fairly mean spirited feeling, and the premise of it is so thin that the majority of it feels like filler. I felt myself getting bored at several occasions. not sure why the film is 2 hours, really not necessary. It seems like this would be better as a skit for SNL.
Paul Rudd, Steve Carell and Jermaine Clement are the highlights of the film. Clearly they are very talented and doing the best with the material they're given. But sadly the writing is just off, and the jokes don't land.

154,monkey_kelstar,"Hysterically funny, but it ended moronically",6,16 August 2010,"This is about a guy named Tim who's about to get a promotion at his company. He's told to come to a dinner his boss is hosting, where the tradition is to bring an idiot with a special skill so everyone can make fun of them. Tim doesn't think that sounds very nice and plans on not going when he randomly meets Barry, who fits the part of ""idiot with a special skill"" perfectly. However, Barry turns out to be way more trouble than he's worth, and nearly ruins Tim's life.If you want to see a movie that makes you laugh so hard it hurts, I highly recommend it. I won't give them all away, but some of the scenes were absolutely hilarious. Sure, it was low comedy, slapstick, most of it, but the laughter it induced was cathartic, therapeutic. However, it wasn't by any means a great movie. It's probably not going to be remembered in years to come. I guess there were two main things I found wrong with it. One is that it dragged on for way too long. We (the audience) kept asking, When's it going to be the dinner part, already? The exposition/rising action took too long. Also, the standards of morality some of the characters had were pretty annoying. Why did Tim's girlfriend have such a problem with him bringing Barry - Steve Carell's character - to the stupid dinner? It was a weak scene when she started getting on his case about it - ""I don't know you anymore, the Tim I know wouldn't do that."" Give him a break. He's just trying to do his job, make a living. And these idiots are such idiots they don't even realize they're being made fun of. The ending was pretty stupid, too. This is a comedy: it obviously ends happy. Though it shouldn't: Tim loses his job, all because he tried to stop the idiots at the dinner from being made fun of. That was pretty dumb. Overall, the story wasn't terribly intelligent, it wasn't haunting or life-changing, but many of the scenes were laugh-out-loud funny, and I suggest seeing it just for fun. Don't expect it to be wonderful - just expect to have a good time watching it.6/10, good comedy, dumb story",Dinner for Schmucks
155,RafiSteinger,"Disappointing movie, not worth seeing",4,9 January 2011,"This movie starring Steve Carrell and Paul Rudd had the potential to be blockbuster comedy but falls far short. To start, Steve Carrell's character while seemingly packed with potential humor, ends up being more like a fly on the wall. Steve Carrell portrays a socially awkward taxidermist that seems to fall just short of being mentally retarded. Paul Rudd plays an ambitious young executive who sees an opportunity to use Steve Carrell's character to his advantage. While this pair seems to have a lot of humor on the surface, the movie projects more of a message than viewers probably want to see; the movie isn't packed with the entertaining humor that old Steve Carrell and Paul Rudd fans probably want to see. Instead most of the jokes are ""forced"" and the situations are more ridiculous than a reasonable individual would believe. Most of the reason why people are fans of ""40 year old virgin"" and ""Role Models"" is because we can relate to the material and style of humor that the movie projects. In ""Dinner for Schmucks"", the tone of the movie is much more serious and it's coupled with even more outlandish situations than a reasonable human would be able to relate to; leaving the overall feeling of the movie mildly uncomfortable. Overall, it's just a disappointing movie. If you're expecting something entertaining and funny don't go see this movie.

158,nowlang,Embarrassing bastardized version of a French classic,2,6 February 2011,"Wow, how low can we go"" Since this movie was (improperly) advertised as the ""English (USA) version of the award-winning French comedy"", let me inform readers about the original.Francis Veber's award-winning comedy classic ""Le Diner de Cons"" (DdeC) released in 1998 quickly became an international success both artistically as financially. DdeC received numerous honors including six Cesar nominations winning three: best script (Francis Veber), best actor (Jacques Villeret aka Francois Pignon), and best supporting actor (Daniel Prevost aka Lucien Cheval, the Revenue Auditor). The ""Cesar du cinema Francais"" is similar to our (USA) Oscar Academy Awards and annually rewards the best performance in the various cinema-related specialties from acting to production. DdeC has been used as a teaching model for writing intelligent humorous scripts, inventive editing, and acting in some cinema schools. Veber adapted his script from his play of the same title which premiered in 1993 and has been playing ever since in Europe. It is a masterpiece worth discovering. The script was intelligently written, the quick paced dialog flowed harmoniously as the protagonist's situation deteriorated. The interpretation was sensitive, expressive and flawless.Back to Dinner for Schmucks: As an American, I found the Hollywood version insulting and demeaning. Trying to bank on the success of the original as is often the case with remakes, you take whatever worked in the first presentation, recycle it, repeat it over, amplify it, mass produce it, etc In Dinner for Schmucks, you steal an original premise, bastardize a bullet-proof script, exaggerate the humorous moments to absurdity, add profanity and obscenity to the dialogue (""he was searching for her lost clitoris under the table""), mix in some sex scenes, sanitize to ensure (American) political correctness, include most ethnic groups to maximize distribution (i.e. profit margin), the only thing missing may have been to add some farts and burps You get the picture. Are we so stupid and ignorant that Hollywood still makes profits feeding us such cheap products? I was insulted having to critique this movie to college students especially since this cinema class had reviewed the French version a few years past. One positive observation: Steve Carell and Paul Rudd did an OK performance as the protagonists unfortunately Carell's role was annoying and exaggerated to plain stupidity as opposed to the social ineptitude of the original performer (Villeret). Jemaine Clement did a believable performance as the artist. As for the real schmuck of this film, it is the director Jay Roach who seems to excel in this type of comedy.Overall, this movie is a lifeless comedy and a very sad but true representation of what many American film productions have degenerated into: cheap financial profit sources without body or soul. Do not waste your money on this lousy production misrepresented as the ""American version of the award-winning French classic comedy"". If that is the case then America is in trouble.Rating: 2 out of 10 for the acting especially Clement's.",Dinner for Schmucks
159,marplesj,It is what it is - daft,5,13 September 2010,"A film which centres around a single dinner was always going to struggle to pad out the remaining showtime and at times Dinner for Schmucks is obviously trying to do so.To begin with, if the lead wasn't Steve Carrell the film would not work in the slightest, tailor made for him and his daft faces/voices. That said, the film is by no means laugh out loud funny from beginning to end, in fact far from it.I counted just one or two scenes where the cinema audience all laughed together, other than that any giggles were scattered and few and far between. In all honesty the film relies way too heavily on the visual improvised humour Carrell and co. come up with which does become tiresome over the length of the film. I also felt slightly let down by Galifianakis and Rudd, not up to their usual high standards - Rudd's relationship with his supposed girlfriend is unbelievable at best.But rather than slate a film entirely I would rather search for its plus points.Some of the characters in the film are hilarious (admittedly others are just plain annoying) and I would have loved to see more of Chris O'Dowd's blind swordsman character Marco. The scene in which he flicks a light switch is brilliant. Also look out for the best intro sequence ever featuring stuffed mice.If you're after a film which will make you giggle, in which you don't have to think at all or indeed if you're a fan of Steve Carrell then this film will do for you. However, don't expect an epic, twisting story and falling in the aisles comedy as it just is not going to and will never happen.",Dinner for Schmucks

If you are into more sophisticated humor, then this is definitely NOT the movie for you.Maybe it's because I love Steve Carell, no matter what he does, or maybe it's some other reason, but this movie kept me entertained and laughing the entire time.

Overall, the humor was subtle and mostly verbal.The best characters were Clement's Keiran and Thurman played by Zach G. Keiran's egotism was hilarious. It's subtle, non-wacky humor. Thurman's delusion of being a mind-controller was funny, too. I could see Thurman as the lead character in his own movie..........I did not buy the premise that Carrell's character was an idiot/schmuck. Carrell did a good job with what he had. Carrell's character was educated/smart enough to be an IRS auditor. Carrell's character had enough social maturity & skills to be married at one time in the character's life, too. I guess the character was a schmuck because he made 'mouster-pieces.' Maybe Carrell should stay on 'The Office?' Maybe he should do dramatic roles like the suicidal professor in 'Little Miss Sunshine?' Carrell is good when he's got good material.

My wife and I were already feeling a little giddy having departed from a friend's birthday party. The slapstick humor, complete ineptitude of Carell's character Barry, and plain silliness of the whole thing simply continued our night. As poor Rudd's character goes through more and more cringe-worthy moments, you still end up appreciating what Barry is trying to do. The film ends up being sort of a wild ride, believe it or not. We laughed a lot.The final scene at the dinner reminded me of the CIA summary at the end of ""Burn After Reading"". After all the craziness that went before, it was the perfect ending.

In Dinner for Schmucks though, his character is so irredeemably unlikeable that the only emotion I could muster was annoyance. Steve fails to capture the charm of Zach Galifianakis' very similar character in Due Date or the wit of Jim Carrey's somewhat similar performance as the unwanted friend in The Cable Guy. He just comes off as a feckless moron who's unlike-ability is topped only by Lucy Punch's horrendously over-the-top performance as the token psycho ex-girlfriend.Paul Rudd plays it is as bland and safe as I've come to expect from every performance he ever gives.

It is a minimal vehicle for the character interactions.This movie is NOT: Drama, Romance, Mystery, or Action with comedy elements added in.

I mean, a dinner for idiots; that's sort of something that doesn't happen very often...The film very open minded and has a fair cast. The best of the bunch was the Mind-Reader.

The screenplay idea had potential and it was probably written having slapstick comedy in mind but it did not deliver.Unfortunately most of the situations that it produced were not funny but rather silly.

175,rugb,Get over yourselves...,8,17 January 2011,"Do the math. Almost everyone who rated it 1-2 stars is a non-American (or self-absorbed film critic) who saw one of the originals that apparently spawned this film and they treat this one like a villain because of it. Yet, most Americans or those who didn't see the original give it at least 4-5 stars even if they didn't like it. Among the more moderate dislikes I also notice a couple common biases. Many dislike the grouchy girlfriend and several more dislike the stupidity of Carell's character. Sounds to me like many nay-sayers bring their own baggage to their bias, to one extreme or the other. What were you expecting? The film is ""Dinner for Schmuks"" not ""Dinner for Sophisticates and Sycophants."" The latter were the antagonists of the film. The plot was Rudd's character realizing that, standing up to them, and befriending a social misfit. The concept and players are not all that different from Napoleon Dynamite; another film people trashed without ""getting it"" yet appreciated more with each viewing. I saw one reviewer say they disliked this film at first and liked it more with each viewing. That's not typical for even a lot of popular films. Most films grow tiresome over time.Bias is natural, but in this case it's largely unfair and unwarranted. On one hand, the pseudo-intellects think this film is dumbed down because they saw a similar film with a more artistic take. Boo-hoo! So give that film 10 stars and be reasonable with a 5, 6, or 7 for this one. I think it borrowed a little from The Party; a late-60s comedy about a dinner party. Should I hate the French or Indian films as ripoffs of that film since it pre-dated them? And of all the truly awful films out there, this is at the bottom? What is your scale? It's just my method, but I consider major criteria for films such as acting, script, music, etc. I may knock a star for every aspect that fails, or maybe a full star for 2-3 minor flaws. My bias plays into it too, but I try to grade on film merits without my bias taking the whole rating. There's a reason there are 10 stars to choose; it's not a black and white, like or dislike, thumbs-up or thumbs down rating scale. Do 1-star raters suggest this film fails at every element of film making? To me, 4-star means it is worse than half of the films ever made, since 5-6 should mean an ""average"" film. 1-star says to me it fails at every aspect of film making and gets a star merely because it's a film - it made production. I've rated very few films below 5 or 6. Most are average or better. If it's that bad, I hope I know better than to see it. Just food for thought.Meanwhile, the other extreme of dislikes seems to have expected a more straight-forward, raunchy comedy like Dumb and Dumber or Austin Powers (I like those btw; not knocking them) or something less silly like a typical rom-com. Instead, it was something in between: a basic comedy with an absurd premise and a very moderate amount of adult humor. It requires a bit more analyzing than most comedies, a bit of an unexpected gut check, and an open mind about the intentions of the film. Was it any more unrealistic than Ferris Bueller? More silly than the original Pink Panthers? More absurd than any Will Ferrell comedy? Check those ratings and rethink your perspective.Among today's films this is easily above average and definitely worth seeing. It certainly warrants a better IMDb rating than it has received so far. It's not amazing, but what in the world were the nay-sayers expecting? Script, premise and originality are the weakest aspects, yet they are adequate. At times the script is even quite clever. Acting is at least average if not better. Story and plot are good. The music is very good. Cinematography is even great for a comedy, especially in the scenes with the mice dioramas. And for those knocking the expectations of the cast: there are 4-5 notable film comedians in the cast. David Williams is the most authentic comedian and most Americans wouldn't even know who he is. He and Steve Carell fulfilled my expectations. Rudd is hardly a legit comedic actor as he has done as many non-comedies and often plays a straight-man. And Galifinakis and Clement have limited roles. Where is the comedic let-down? Take the film for what it is. It's about the relationship between Rudd's and Carell's characters, and what Rudd's character learns and appreciates in the process. Comedy is literally a secondary genre. I agree that it was advertised poorly.Finally, I was surprised how much human element is in the film. Very touching at times. (Reminds me of John Hughes films how you can be laughing one moment, brought to deep introspection a moment later, then laughing soon again.) Admittedly, the film goes flat at times, but only for brief periods and it ends reasonably well. I didn't like the Darla character. She detracted from the story and the annoying grouchy aspect of the girlfriend came directly from that. Plus the girlfriend was a mediocre actress and her character may have been improved by reworking the involvement of the Darla character. Nevertheless, if you watch it with an open mind and reserve the expectations a bit, I think most will be pleasantly surprised. In fact, I was apprehensions about seeing it, and never saw it in theatres. I reluctantly rented it when there was nothing else to rent and was glad I did.",Dinner for Schmucks
176,prishelec,Decent but very uneven,5,7 June 2011,"First of all I haven't watched the original, so I can't compare to it. As you can see a lot of people that didn't like that movie watched the original and I guess a little of ""original is better"" makes reviews a little bit biased.Steve Carel's role is his usual - goodhearted idiot - ""The Office"", ""Get Smart"", ""40-year..."". And he is good at it, no complaining :)It looks like writers didn't put much work into the script. 1. It's predictable as hell - from the moment boss told about the dinner - outcome was apparent (by that time we already knew about the guy with mice) -> they would become friends and main character would end up defending the poor guy. 2. It's very uneven. Scenes with mice are cute, some jokes are funny, but then come scenes like the final one where Tim tells Barry about how much he loves Julie. It was painful to watch.But overall it's a decent date comedy - not a lot of laughs, but very cute and leaves you in a good humor(especially last ~3 minutes of stories what happened after).",Dinner for Schmucks
177,Rick_Gershman,"Though an unambitious, boilerplate comedy, it's packed with laughs.",7,31 July 2010,"It's remarkable how quickly the new comedy Dinner for Schmucks disappears from your brain. I can recall laughing my way through the vast majority of the film--mostly soft laughs, but there were more than a few big, hearty laughs from deep down in the diaphragm. (One might more economically call such a laugh a ""guffaw,"" but guffaw is such a silly word I refuse to acknowledge I might ever participate in one.)Despite the inarguable fact that I was entertained throughout the entirety of Dinner for Schmucks -- a film that never actually uses the word ""schmuck,"" but we'll get to that -- I can't deny feeling rather empty while considering it a little more than a day later. I think this must be why many reviewers are giving the flick fairly lukewarm marks, though they had to be laughing their respective asses off on occasion just as I was.There are lots of reasons not to respect the movie. There's the fact that it's reportedly a fairly pale ""reimagination"" of a French film, Francis Veber's Le dîner de cons (The Dinner Game). (I haven't seen the original, so I can't compare.) The screenplay is inarguably mediocre. Some of the characters, especially those at the eventual dinner, are lazily imagined. And it's disappointing to see Paul Rudd, who's capable of much more interesting, brilliantly caustic characters (in Wet Hot American Summer and Anchorman, for starters) relegated to playing yet another purely-reactive straight man.And yet... Dinner for Schmucks is funny. Very funny. Occasionally laugh- out-loud funny. It's like a frozen Snickers bite-size bar when you're having a chocolate craving: Incredibly satisfying for about five minutes... after which, you'll forget all about it.Yet I can't help wanting to recommend Schmucks, and dammit, that's exactly what I'm going to do. Because for the ninety minutes you're in the theater, it is a lot of fun. It's a much better date night film than, say, the relentlessly mediocre Date Night.Those two films don't just share a star in Steve Carell. They also share a philosophy: Take a half-interesting situation, flesh it out a bit with half-written characters and a half-written screenplay, and let the stars make it sing. Date Night was only moderately tolerable because it had Carell and the always-entertaining Tina Fey as its leads. With Carell and Rudd joined by a far more interesting supporting cast (and a much sharper director), Schmucks is like Date Night done right.Carell and Rudd are consummate comedic pros with perfect chemistry together. You can't help but figure working together in Anchorman and The 40-Year-Old Virgin played a role there. With the expert guidance of director Jay Roach (helmer of the Austin Powers and Meet the Parents/Fockers series), they mine every possible laugh out of every line, every expression, every reaction shot.That's especially impressive because neither actor is working with a particularly well-crafted role here. Barry (Carell) is an amalgam of all sorts of odd eccentricities and levels of confusion, though his meticulous talent at turning dead mice into works of art suggests he's some sort of idiot savant. As many a commercial has already informed you, he gets invited to a very different sort of social dinner by Tim, a finance executive desperate to impress his bosses.Tim is virtually indistinguishable from the other ""straight men"" Rudd has played in recent comedies. Only the goofball buddy and the gorgeous girlfriend change. In Role Models, Rudd suffers through Seann William Scott's crazy schemes, which threaten his relationship with Elizabeth Banks. In I Love You, Man, Rudd's new ""bromance"" with Jason Segal threatens his engagement to Rashida Jones. And in Schmucks, Rudd's dinner plans with Carell threaten to derail his planned engagement to fresh face Stephanie Szostak.Schmucks ramps up the funny thanks to Roach's direction and some extremely well-chosen supporting players. It's very strange that Zach Galifianakis' name doesn't even appear on the Schmucks poster, especially given how hot he is following The Hangover and how heavily he's featured in the commercials. Though he appears in what amounts to only two scenes, the actor hijacks the film wholesale, and not in the wild, over-the-top sort of cameo you might expect from, say, a Will Ferrell or Ben Stiller.Following suit, albeit with much more screen time, is Flight of the Conchords' Jemaine Clement, who does do the over-the-top thing as avant garde artist Kieran, and it's perfectly brilliant. (One can easily foresee a Get Him to the Greek-type spin off for the character.) Every time Schmucks threatens to stall, it wisely finds a way to weave Kieran back into the proceedings.The longest period in which we don't see Kieran is also Schmucks' weakest stretch, the actual dinner itself. The French original apparently never included the actual dinner, and maybe that was a good move. The boss who puts on the dinner actually considers it a ""dinner for idiots"" -- the word ""schmucks"" is never used, and one figures that term came from some studio exec worried about the word ""idiot.""Barry's fellow idiots at the dinner aren't particularly funny, and this is where the film goes for some fairly broad laughs that are only fitfully amusing. In fact, the best part of the dinner is when Barry gets to show off some of his ""mousterpieces,"" a segment that's more than a little touching.Despite such faults, Schmucks plays it smart most of the time. It's sad that Office Space's Ron Livingston doesn't have much to do as Tim's nemesis, but two Daily Show personalities, Larry Wilmore and Kristen Schaal (also of Conchords), are pitch-perfect in small roles.On the whole, Schmucks isn't one of the decade's great comedies. But if you're satisfied with laughing for 90 minutes, and enjoying talented actors rise (well) above their material, it's definitely worth your time.",Dinner for Schmucks

I laughed about five times in the entire movie and the film was just a drag. That's not good for a comedy.I admire Steve in portraying the idiot friend who sabotages everything but he wasn't believable.

I find it strange to be characterizing Carell's performance as subtle in a film that has ""Schmucks"" in the title, but that's what it was. While films like ""Grown Ups"" bash the viewer over the head with their (sort of) comedy, Carell is much more subtle than that in this film. His character ends up being utterly endearing by film's end.I also have to comment on director Jay Roach for bringing out this performance in Carell. Never before during the watching of a film did I find myself laughing and crying at the same time, and that is due to the masterful touches imparted by Roach and Carell.",Dinner for Schmucks

183,gerold-firl,"brilliant comedy, with heart and brains",10,15 January 2011,"Dinner for Schmucks is not just a funny comedy. It is hilarious, and one of the best comedies of the last several years. I rate it with the Hangover and Superbad, it's that funny. The large number of negative reviews and relatively low rating (6.1) are a mystery to me. It's true that the title Schmuck played by Carrel is a very flawed character, and I can only conclude that the people who didn't get this movie couldn't get past that. If you can't handle a deeply flawed main character, then you probably won't like Dinner for Schmucks.It's a movie with two primary characters, and in more ways than one it resembles the character structure of Tommy Boy: one is smart and cynical, the other is dumb and innocent. Carrel and Rudd take it to a new level, however. Rudd plays a very smart, and very successful junior executive in high finance. He has a wonderful girlfriend and lifestyle, except for one small problem: his job requires that he behave in ways that are not very nice. However, he does get paid very handsomely to do it, and he has a very bright future ahead of him. He is willing to compromise his principles a little - after all, what he does is perfectly legal - but he doesn't have to like it. Like many of us in the industrialized world, especially in business, he sells a little of his soul and gets a nice car in return. Some viewers may find this distressing - a little too close to home, perhaps?The other character, Barry, played by Carrel, is pathologically clueless. He is one of the best screen portrayals of a pathetic loser ever seen. Fortunately, he does have some redeeming qualities: he is an excellent taxidermist, and his hobby of stuffing dead rodents and placing them in diorama scenarios is of such quality that is qualifies as art. His intentions are good, his heart is all right, but he is so oblivious, so socially retarded, that he caused tremendous problems for anyone he meets. As a result, he has no friends at all. None. He is completely alone in the world, but manages to maintain a largely positive view despite that. This is another reason why some people will find this movie painful to watch, and difficult to laugh at - they see too much of Barry in themselves.But for those of us who can recognize our own faults and failings, and even laugh at them, Dinner for Schmucks is an amazing and uproariously hilarious movie. It also has a beautiful message of inclusion and acceptance. As the movie progresses, we learn that we are all schmucks, and no one is. By accepting one another, flaws included, we're all better off. And by recognizing our flaws, and laughing at them, we can all be better people. I loved this movie.",Dinner for Schmucks

And apparently wanted to pay Rudd's character for running over him. I really found some of the scenes in this movie funny. I usually don't like comedy movies nowadays because they're just not funny!! Steve Carrell steals the whole movie with his mouse diorama or whatever you wanna call it. The whole thing with Darla( Lucy Punch) was really funny too! Well Skip to the end in the dinner scene, really made laugh, because of all the other weirdo's especially Octavia Spencer's character who can communicate with the dead( animals). The ending was somewhat touching and sweet. This movie has its stupid moments but good to watch when your down in the dumps. But don't expect it to be like LAUGHING SO HARD THAT YOu CANT BREATHE AND YOU JUST SH*T YOUR PANTS but its a fun, entertaining, comedy that will leave you warm inside and all that cheesy bull sh*t. So there you have it. I give this movie a 7/10 :)",Dinner for Schmucks
186,parisa6,Hated almost every minute of this movie...And I am a Rudd and Carell fan!,1,7 August 2010,"Guess who the schmuck is? Me and anyone else who was fooled into hoping that a movie by such comedic powerhouses as Steve Carell and Paul Rudd would be worth the $14 ticket price. Or worth our time.I wanted to leave the movie 10 minutes into it when I had not even laughed once. Then, Carell made his scene entry into the movie and a smile came across my face. ""Carell will make it all better"" I thought. Not only did Carell not make the movie any better, he made it agonizingly more painful.Before you accuse me of not having a sense of humor, know that I have loved the two-previous Rudd and Carell joint ventures: The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy. Dinner for Schmucks is nothing like either of those two movies but instead more like a bad Saturday Night Live skit that goes on five minutes too long.Schmucks uses plenty of cheap and unoriginal tricks to either grab laughs or to advance the plot but fails miserably at both. Best you can hope for are a few and I do mean a few scattered laughs, amidst a lot of creepiness, meanness and awfulness. Save your money. Save your time. But, if it's comedy you're in the mood for, go see the aptly-named The Other Guys--as those other guys, Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg, brought it! That comedy left both my jaw and stomach in pain from laughing so hard throughout the movie. Parisa Michelle - www.CelebMagnet.com",Dinner for Schmucks

We could see Inception again (Great movie), Dinner for Schmucks, Pirana3-D which we joked about seeing. Or see the other guys, again. Okay, so we get to the theatre, and this guy (Paul Rudd) has the most amazing life imaginable. About to get a big promotion, his beautiful girlfriend is also has amazing things going for her in the feild of arts. Amazing apartment, etc. Okay all is good until Steve Carrel is hit by Rudd's car. This is when I honestly could bare to watch the movie. It's so painful to see Steve completely ruin Rudd's life. I haven't walked out on a movie since ""The Master of Disguise"" which was the worst movie I've ever seen, nor have I thought of walking out on a movie. But my friends and I needed to see the boring and pointless ending, just so we could see Rudd finally happy, well, remotely happy. Save yourself time, money, and the excruciating experience.

Well, let me tell you something, you don't understand anything from movies, and next time you are about to give 1 or 2 stars on a movie like this, consider throwing your DVD player away, because you don't deserve to own one. This was the most entertaining and touching movie I have seen in a while. I love Steve Carell and he did not disappoint as well as the rest of the cast. Why did I give this movie a 10 star rating? Because it delivered what I expected, because it made me and the people around me laugh and because this movie deserves a higher rating. Simple as that, that's all I want to say.Try having fun and stop being miserable with your fake ratings.",Dinner for Schmucks

Not that i expected a modern day classic anyway.With cast that makes you chuckle just by saying their names, this movie had a lot going for itself.Call it bad directing or just flat out bad writing, this film was not created to its utmost potential and i feel that the creators underestimated the actors amazing skill in drilling a hole straight through our funny bone.Besides a handful of hilarious moments,Dinner for Schmucks was filled with cheap and generic humor.As far as the cast's performance, i felt that Steve Carell SAVED THIS FILM. He plays a simpleminded IRS agent and has the unusual hobby of creating dioramas with deceased rodents, while Paul Rudd plays as a rising employee at a type of innovation investors company who isn't quite sure what he wants in life. As for the story, i think that its your basic comedy, a person who was having nothing but good luck hits a bump in the road,the domino effect takes place,and we all laugh at their demise.Although this is not the unsurpassed comedy of the summer, i still feel that this is not one you should pass.I give this movie 6/10, check it out.",Dinner for Schmucks
190,jshadle0807,"Come on, you knew EXACTLY what you were getting into!",5,5 August 2010,"You did and you know it! You saw the previews and you saw the loser Steve Carell was playing. You knew it was going to be lame the second you heard stuff like 'Steve Carell at his best!' and when you saw the movie poster. I mean, look at it! (I'm not going into the plot. You know what is by now).Now I personally have never been a huge fan of Steve Carell. He always plays the same character in everything . . . however, that character always 'works'. I'll give him that.However, he is downright irritating in this movie! Seriously, I was ready to strangle him by the time the actual dinner rolled around. That is, until he started on his 'Tower of Dreamers' thing. He almost redeemed himself for me after that . . . almost. If you didn't laugh at some of those lines and dioramas, you were not in the mood for a comedy! There were some laugh out loud moments in this movie and I enjoyed the movie for the most part. However there were things I hated too. So let's get started.Star #1 goes to Paul Rudd because I feel bad for him. Why is he always the straight man? He is genuinely funny and I felt bad for him the whole movie. His girlfriend? Serious biatch. (I'll get to her later) And I give a star to ANYONE who could put up with Barry! Besides, Paul Rudd is one of my celebrity crushes :) Star #2 goes to Jemaine Clement. He was absolutely hysterical so many times! That role could have been so painful but he nailed it! I wanted to see him more! Star #3 goes to Zach Galifianakis. He's hilarious in a really creepy kind of way. ""Say you can eat my pudding."" I was really confused for a while and then you find out what that means. Ew! But seriously, he is the new rising comedic actor of today.Star #4 goes to the smaller parts like Kirsten Schaal, Jeff Dunham (should've been in it more!), and Larry Wilmore. They were just priceless! Well, I think Jeff Dunham could've been but he was obviously there just for the producers to be able to say he was there.Star #5 doesn't really go to anyone in particular. I don't think this movie is bad enough to be 4/10 because I did laugh out loud several times. ""And people said 'you only have one ear, you can't be an artist!' And Van Gogh said 'I can't hear you.'"" Now for the things that took away the other five stars.Star #6 was ruined by the character of Julie. Once the dinner was mentioned, she became the most irritating person in the movie. Yeah, that includes Barry! Seriously, who believes that their trustworthy boyfriend is going to just give away the engagement ring to some crackpot? Ugh, her plot was just annoying.Star #7 didn't exist because of Barry. I'm not getting to in depth because honestly, you've read this review and many others. Irritating character.Star #8 disappeared due to the plot line in general. I don't get why some brilliant executive wants a ton of idiots over at his beautiful home where they could potentially do damage for dinner and have a contest to see who brought the biggest moron. Stupid. Just really stupid. Was it so we hate big corporations? Um the oil spill happened due to BP. We're already hating big corporations.Star #9 went bye bye because of the idiots at the dinner! WTF? Okay Jeff Dunham's could've been funnier. There was potential there. And Barry and his boss (Zach Galifianakis) were funny together, for the most part. But that weird pet mediator lady? And the blind guy? And the beard guy? And the other people whose ticks I don't remember? Yeah, I don't remember. I saw this movie yesterday. Ugh, everybody else was just . . . weird. Not so much dumb, just weird.Star #10? Fail screen writing. Some of the dialogue was really awkward and some of the jokes were just not funny.All in all, I'd still recommend this movie. It was funny for 90 minutes and then you forget about it. Maybe wait to rent it or when it hits that cheap theater in your area.",Dinner for Schmucks

Yes, you do.There are nights for Inception, Shutter Island, Avatar. And there're nights for movies like Dinners for Schmucks. Have you not read the title when you purchased the tickets? I bet you haven't. The people who actually bought a tickets for a movie entitled ""Dinner for Schmucks"" should know exactly what they're getting themselves into.

I found myself laughing hard at most jokes. Overall this was a very funny film it was no ""Godfather"" but it was a hysterical movie. The strongest part of the movie to me was the plot. The plot was so good, that at one point the entire theater gasped and went ""ooooooooooooooooooooooo"" over...well I don't want to spoil anything but it had to do with one of the main characters and his relationship with his girlfriend. THAT'S HOW GOOD THE PLOT WAS! Steve Carrell was perfect. I'm so glad he's leaving ""The Office"" yes, it's an okay show but we've seen enough of him playing an annoying boss who we never get to understand as a character or anything. Anyway Dinner for Shmucks was a good movie at times (hardly) it slacked off a bit but i'm going to have to give it a low ""FULL PRICE!""

194,ekayepiao,Steve Carell and Paul Rudd in one movie? A blessing!,10,28 March 2019,"A legendary comedy movie!! The concept was just so amazing. At first, you think it will be ""messed up"" because its gonna be a dinner for idiots and make fun of them. My last sentence was a reference to the movie lol.I like the development of Tim and Barry's friendship because you know, in the start, Tim accidentally hit Barry with his car then they met. Barry showed Tim his work with dead mice dioramas and Tim thinks that Barry is an idiot then he invited him to the ""Dinner for Idiots"". A lot of disasters happened, Tim's life got messed up, Barry thought Tim was lying to him about everything. But after all that, they still managed to forgive each other and their friendship got better.Steve and Paul are straight up comedy geniuses. Seeing them in one screen in one comedy is like living the dream. Their acting skills are so amazing and they can literally handle ANY role. Their chemistry made me really speechless. Not because of them this movie will not be THAT funny. It was very hilarious! The jokes were well written, even though there's sexual jokes, it made the movie funnier! Also, the cinematography was actually so good.To end this review, I want to tell you that you should appreciate this movie more. It really deserves recognition.

I felt like watching an episode of The Office on crack, speed and blow. The movie at times looses a grip with reality so much in an attempt to be witty, funny and quirky at the same time but in the end it comes out as dull, uninventive and just plain retarded. The relationships between characters are forced and non-believable as much as the situations that they create. The most interesting part is that the ""non-idiot"" characters are actually more moronic than the so called ""idiots"". I can't believe that so many good actors accepted to be in this crap.

I am not really a fan of the people in the movie, but everyone else seems to like them so I decided to give it a go.I made it through about a quarter of the movie before I turned it off.

Not one single laugh through the first quarter of the movie.Think about it.... Nothing to do on a plane for nine hours and not even this movie could keep me occupied.

199,olivia-rambleon,Lots of laughs,8,29 May 2013,"Funny until the end. Steve was hilarious in his character, because he was very real and animated, but actually had a few moments where he became hurt by harsh words and withdrew into himself, or angry at Paul after hearing him say negative things about him behind his back. But these moments were then trip wired to have him snap back into his grinning wacky character to keep the entire movie on a light note.I have to say, I was laughing very hard during the chase scene between him and Paul Rudd's maniac stalker girlfriend. His performance was not forced or overly funny to where it seems like a theatrical, and he played well off of Paul Rudd, who himself had a few golden moments, such as singing high pitched opera without knowing his employer was behind him, or acting like an earwig. Definitely worth watching. Grab a few friends and enjoy.",Dinner for Schmucks
200,sdhardin,A really funny movie,8,31 July 2010,"Wow, lots of mixed reviews on this thing so far. Well, I'm going to throw in my two cents worth because I saw the French version (Le Diner des Cons) a few years ago and therefore had a reference point in mind when I saw Dinner for Schmucks. If you think the businessmen in Dinner are mean, please see the French version--I would not have given it as high a vote precisely because the meanness in that one reaches depths I don't appreciate at all. Also, the French movie is not even close to being as funny as Dinner is. I've never liked slapstick or very physical humor much and, even though there's a little of it in Dinner, I enjoyed the movie very much. I don't know about these reviewers who say there's a chuckle here or there--my family lives in a very conservative community that, for the most part, has little sense of humor--everyone in the theater when we saw the movie absolutely ROARED with laughter too many times to keep count. Some people nearly lost their breath. Lots of coughing.Hmm. I guess everyone has to judge for him- or herself.

And aside from Kieran's part being played by Jemaine Clement (still very well performed, although, Russel Brand would be perfect for the part), every single actor in the movie delivered.

And I think they are probably ashamed of this film.This is hands down Steve Carell's worst role I've ever seen. Although, there is no actor who could play this part well. To make a main character in a film this stupid is a blasphemy, all the more if he's supposed to have a job that actually requires to have a functioning brain. Entire duration of film you have a feeling that you're watching a three year old child in a body of Carell. Beside having a overwhelming feeling of desperation for having to even watch this thrash.And I wouldn't even mind the stupidity of characters if there was a lot of funny situations or dialogues (eg. Dumb and Dumber) but this film is half way between comedy and drama, trying to provoke your compassion for the most stupid, and trying to make you laugh (although unsuccesfully) with bad jokes.

209,hurumble,If you have any self-respect you will never see this movie,2,30 July 2010,"Paul Rudd and Steve Carell represent a new era in popular comedies to me. Movies they have starred in are on the whole intelligent, witty, and have plenty of heart. They gave me an alternative to dumb comedies... comedies starring Adam Sandler, Will Ferrell, Jim Carrey, and Mike Myers (not that I mean to completely put down all the stuff these guys have done.. they've all had their share of moments). Of course, I should have realized that when I saw the movie was going to be directed by the same guy as Meet the Parents and Austin Powers, I was going to get a movie with the same kind of humor... the humor that I enjoyed when I was 10. Steve Carrell plays an agonizingly dumb character. Unlike characters like Harry and Lloyd, however, there is nothing funny about Carrell's character. I'm a Steve Carrell fan, but he was the worst part of this movie. He delivers maybe two or three funny lines in the entire movie. I also felt I was misled by the trailers as to what this would be about. I got the impression by the trailers I had seen that this would primarily take place at the dinner and that the characters played by Jemaine Clement and Lucy Punch were two of those schmucks. Not the case. 3/4 of the movie occurs in the two days leading up to the dinner, and Jemaine and Lucy were never a part of the dinner, despite easily being qualified to be. The movie uses plenty of cheap, tired, unoriginal tricks throughout to either grab laughs or to advance the plot. There are two times when two characters are having conversations about another character, who unambiguously (yet the one talking still somehow has no clue) walks in in the middle of the conversation to hear something being said about themselves. The one bright spot of this movie was Jemaine Clement. If it wasn't for him I would have walked out of the movie. He gave me the most laughs. Let's put it this way: another movie came out last year with good actors starring in a movie that was panned by critics, Year One. This movie, while still somehow being way better with the critics, gave me about a quarter of the laughs as Year One did, and that is in no way a defense of Year One but a huge shot against Dinner for Schmucks.",Dinner for Schmucks
210,claritadeb73,Great cast. Poor story. Watch the French original.,3,16 September 2020,"Do yourself a favour and just watch the French original Diner de Cons. This adaptation completely misses the point and turns Rudd into a likeable guy and Carrell isn't such a ""schmuck"". Which in turn weakens the whole point of the farce. Sadly something we see US cinema do over and over again. I wonder if this had been made in 2020 by Netflix a few more risks would have been taken.The casting is an impressive list of names. And their performances pretty flawless. It's not their fault the story and script isn't up to scratch. The film was made at critical times in their careers, so I'm doubting they challenged it.Standouts in the supporting cast are Lucy Punch and Jemaine Clement. Walliams isn't bad either, his usual self but without the overacting. Zach Galifianakis is Zach Galifianakis (yawn in 2020 but probably not at the time).It's watchable.

There's some big comedians on supporting roles, but it really doesn't help the film. The script is just dreadful, it just doesn't work, the story is ridiculous which shouldn't be a problem for a comedy, but in this one everything is so predictable its painful. 1 star is a generous rating, avoid at all costs.",Dinner for Schmucks
212,boju-yanis,Not half funny as the original version. #overthetop,5,28 February 2018,"Being French, I was very curious to see how the Americans adapted ""Le Diner de Cons"" into an American comedy.If you're a French and want to see this, spare yourself the time. There are a lot of elements that are similar to the original version. Yes, they are similar but yet different in the way the outcomes and twists occur. The reason for which I watched it is because Steve Carrel plays the most important role (the imbecile) and I love this guy. His interpretation of 'Pignon' is interesting but is too cheesy in my taste.In the French Version, Jacques Villeret (who plays the imbecile) strives to be his normal self but keeps doing stupid stuff over and over (unvoluntary!!), which makes the situation(s) worse and worse as the movie unfolds. The thing that may annoy and put off most of comedy viewers with this American remake, is the fact that the 'imbecile' is OVER played. It is very obvious that 'Barry' is too much of a moron to be true which led me to roll my eyes on a few occasions... Barry just looks like his only goal in the movie is to stay in Tim's life and screws everything up.One may safely affirm that Barry is trying to fuck up everything through the whole film contrary to 'Pignon' in the French Film who looks like a decent guy who's trying his best to do the right thing, but screws everything up in spite of his good-hearted self, which makes the self hilarious.The thing I hated the most is the fact that production tried to convey a morale and some cheesy message at the end of the film, which makes no sense to me. The only redeeming quality of this film is the performance of both Steve Carell and Zach Galifianakis (especially the latter who has outdone himself with his performance) I do not know a single French person who doesn't like 'Le diner de cons' . Therefore if you're in the mood for a good/great comedy film, go ahead and watch this French classic with subtitles.",Dinner for Schmucks

The story is also pretty interesting.I confess some parts were a bit annoying, and how ridiculous dumb the main character was. But there were many hilarious scenes.

215,toastyinva,Save your money and time,4,4 August 2010,This is one of those movies where you sit for long times between so much as a snicker. The humor is dumb at worst and annoying at best. The actual dinner plays such a small part of this movie that it's misleading to think that is what this movie is all about. I think the script was so busy trying to flush out showing us why the idiot is such an idiot that it completely left out making it funny. I'm really afraid Steve Carrell is in the same league as Will Ferrell. He can't carry a movie and is a one-trick pony. He is better in small doses. I would not recommend this movie unless you think you can relate to the schmucks of the world. The guy behind me laughed uncontrollably and I laughed more at him laughing than anything in this movie. Painful to watch.,Dinner for Schmucks

This time I could not escape because it was playing on a bus I was on.This is a (rather poor) rip off of the delightful & funny, but not much known, Bollywood movie ""Bhejafry"". While the mentioned Bollywood movie was awesome because it built on an exaggeration of certain peculiar personalities that are actually found in India; but in a shoddy attempt to copy the movie - the Hollywood directors either didn't attempt to figure why the movie was so hilarious or didn't care - and proceeded to poorly copy a lot of the plot without understanding the cultural nuances that made the original movie funny.Result: Weird characters that bear no close resemblance to anyone either in India or in the US and this not relate-able; are not particularly funny - but extremely annoying.Do yourself a favor and skip this non sense.",Dinner for Schmucks

Then after seeing the IMDb rating I was a little hesitant then I heard reviews from people I knew who went to see it and they were not the greatest. So when I went to see this movie 2 nights ago I was kinda expecting to leave disappointed. However, I was positively surprised to see that I actually enjoyed this movie. It was HORRIBLY frustrating for a large percentage of the time which is where I think many people gave up on this movie. Yet somehow Meet The Parents is something of a classic (though it is only rated slightly higher IMDb wise) and while I loved that movie when it first came out when I try to watch it now it is the most frustrating thing ever!! That is the whole point of this movie, you are supposed to want to punch Steve Carell in the face.

And if they are made, your forced to watch them as punishment for stealing a snickers from the local gas station. Paul Rudd and Steve Carrell are amazing actors...with that said this film gave nothing for either of them to work with. Rudd didn't make me or anyone in the theater laugh once. Carrell a comedic genius that he is was so stupid and annoying in this film, I had to wonder how Darwin's Law shouldn't have ended this guys life by age 14 tops. The film's secondary characters of Zach Galifianakis and Jermaine Clement where the only tiny light of hope in this film. My girlfriend and I said on three occasions that we should leave the film and when a couple actually did, gravity almost pulled me in their direction. I forced myself to stay and finish the movie. At the end I couldn't give a damn about any of the characters or there meaningless relationships.

It seemed that every line he spoke managed to make me laugh hysterically. He was the main source of humor, but not the only one. Paul Rudd did a great job carrying the lead role, and Galifinakis was his usual quirky self. I will warn you that this movie takes a little while to get started but hang in there. The story is heavily clichéd but overall you will have a great time seeing this with friends once, but that is about the extent of it.------------------------- 6 out of 10",Dinner for Schmucks

Steve C is so one of the best actors out there.. Paul rudd is so funny as well... I though the office was nice where the film mostly took place..

Actually 95% of the movie doesn't take place at the dinner, just the terrible events beforehand. The movie makes you cringe and incredibly uncomfortable. Paul Rudd has a nice job, hot wife, nice apartment, and a promotion awaiting. Then Steve Carell enters Paul's life. Every event that could go wrong goes wrong in the worst way. In Paul's adventure of just being around Steve, he gets audited, breaks up with his fiancé, contacts his stalker, get his apartment ruined, and then loses his promotion and job. This all takes place in the first 2 hours. In those two hours you only stay in the theater is seeing the ""happy"" ending. Made me laugh a few times but in the end I left the theater depressed. Save your money and time and go see the next comedy that comes out. Hopefully that movie will actually make you laugh and not want to hang yourself.",Dinner for Schmucks
224,antithesisguy,The best comedy since Austin Powers.,9,1 October 2010,"Unlike other reviewers, i'm not going to slate it, comparing it to an obscure french film nobody watched. Instead I'm going to review it for what it was, a mainstream Hollywood film, the funniest one I've seen since Austin Powers.It was sidesplitting, literally I was keeled over and fell off my chair in the cinema because it was so funny. The charisma of David Walliams and Jemaine Clement were amazing, portraying stereotypes in wholly redefining ways that were invigorating, the way Walliams never took it seriously, but reveled in quips and over zealous accents.Carroll's range of emotional torture throughout is immense and beautiful, whilst Rudd enters the role wholly with deep satisfaction for the viewer and Szostak is a great new talent.After this I went to see Grown Ups with Adam Sandler. Now that film was terrible! In comparison this had so much plot complexity (we find out why Carroll does the things he does in such delicate layering that it is quite breathtaking).Masterpiece of comedy. Don't let the zealots watching french cinema lie to you.",Dinner for Schmucks

Paul Rudd plays the straight part to Steve Carell's 'funny' man, but the two don't have any dynamism together and just don't 'click', this means that Paul Rudds character comes across as very dull and boring. Most of the gags don't work and I'll never watch this film again and suggest you don't waste your time or money with it. I laughed once, briefly, mid way through this mess of a film. It seemed to last forever and I was overjoyed once it had finished so I could go and do something more fun like self harm.",Dinner for Schmucks
226,aleciakichton,Good movie,7,1 March 2012,"This movie's summary is about a man who runs into an idiot and earlier in that day his boss said they needed to bring an idiot to a dinner with all their co workers and their idiot they choose. After the dinner his boss crowns the biggest idiot there and make fun of him. The man is in a dilemma between listening to his girlfriend or bring the idiot to dinner. When the man talks to the idiot, the idiot thinks that they are best friends and that he actually likes him but little does he know he is just being set up. Later in the movie he ends up bringing the idiot to dinner and trying to be discrete about it so his girlfriend doesn't find out. He ends up realizing though that his idiot is actually very talented and so are all the other people they brought. When his boss goes to crown his idiot he feels very bad and is upset that he might ruin their friendship.This movie had a good plot but it was one too much like the others and was predictable as what was going to happen. It wasn't so much boring though because the dinner was funny and just to watch who all his co workers brought as their idiots and the night was filled with suspense and excitement. This movie does show a VERY strong message though and that is it's not nice to make fun of people especially if you don't know them because you may actually like them if you take your time and talk to them. The lesson shown is that all their idiots seem to be more talented them all of the workers and the workers look more like idiots than them.",Dinner for Schmucks

228,weiji2001,Truly a Horrible Adaptation of the French Film,1,28 June 2012,"It might help if you never saw the original French version, ""Les Diner des Cons,"" Somehow, when Hollywood appropriates French films it nearly always leads to a disappointment (or loss) in translation. This is no exception.The original French film was built on a satirical premise of French social manners, based on how the French view a cultivated person. I don't know what this version satirizes, and I don't think anyone involved in this film did, either.The original version was also very funny. The humorous situations, very similar to the US version, were beautifully timed and very plausible. I've never laughed so much as I did watching the French version. To make this story plausible, the Rudd role really needs to be convincingly ruthless and mean. But Paul Rudd as a supposedly ambitious private equity analyst trying to climb the corporate ladder only comes off a nice guy, a regular guy, a bland guy - not someone who really wants to win at all costs - which would justify all the bad luck the character has.Carrell, as the idiot, should almost immediately gain our sympathy, but this over-the-top performance with the fake hair, nose and buck teeth only plays for low humor laughs. In the end, it's really hard to care about his broken marriage or the fact that he was ridiculed. The manic Carrell pitted against the bland Rudd comes off acting like Jim Carrey's Lloyd Christmas in ""Dumb and Dumber"", except without the laughs.My advice - get a copy of ""Les Diner des Cons"" if you want a to see a really great film and laugh yourself silly.",Dinner for Schmucks

I did not laugh once during the movie. It was so painful to sit through this movie. The humor was so awful, a middle school child could write this movie. I really wish I could get my 7 bucks back, not because I am upset I lost it, because I do not want to give this movie any money. I would rather have the 7 bucks given to a child in the theater to go play video games. Everyone!....please listen to me and save your time and money.

I should have trusted what my gut knows about Steve Carell and just watched it soon because I laughed  off from start to finish. Carell plays a kind hearted IRS employee with a bizarre all be it harmless hobby, who continually miss social cues, and makes ever problem worse despite his best efforts. Carell is a master at the awkward moment and this film is loaded with them. The rest of the cast is stack with great comedic actors that who are no stranger to the awkward comedy play book.

As a fan of Steve Carell and Paul Rudd (not to mention Jermaine Clement and Zak G) and sometimes of director Jay Roach, it's hard to reckon how none of these talented people noticed how strained, mean-spirited and downright ridiculous this comedy is. No one behaves like an actual human being, and Carell's ""loser"" character is so annoying you're insulted when the script asks us to find him lovable-- you'd rather strangle him. A deeply cynical, formulaic farce without a shred of anything resembling reality. Even the broadest comedy has to be based in some recognizable behavior. It mocks the bad corporate villains for making fun of the fools invited to the party, and does the same thing itself. A few scattered laughs is the best you can hope for.

It was essentially a crappy Family Matters' Urkel meets What About Bob's Bob meets Problem Child's whatever the name of that kid was. It follows the basic overused formula of annoying character (Steve Carell) screws up every aspect of likable character's (Paul Rudd) life, pause for laugh, pause longer, still no laugh, move on, and then likable character accepts and learns to love annoying character. Nothing new. Nothing funny. You're just kinda left asking your self why didn't Rudd's character just tell Carell's character to go away, or punch him in the face, or something. Instead he passively stands by watching his life be systematically dismantled by an unfunny stranger with nothing more than a ""wow I'm mildly unconvinced by all of this you ruining my life stuff, please spend the night and sleep on my sofa"" attitude.

236,dollyrf,Laughed out Loud kinda funny!,10,10 September 2010,"I am surprised to see the bad reviews on this movie. I laughed out loud the whole movie except for the small bits of serious parts. Carrell's role was hilarious, and very well played. If I gonna criticize him on one thing, maybe he could of did a better job of making the character a bit more ""likeable"". I know the sob story part was probably meant to do that but I didn't buy it. I would still punch him and ditch that annoying guy on the side of the road. And that being said... maybe Rudd's role seemed a bit too dumb to be following Carrells advices.Basically, I like watching a movie where the actors seem to be having fun and it was obvious that everyone, especially Carell, was having fun in this one. Some jokes seemed spontaneous, they seemed like spur of the moment type of jokes. Those are the best because you really don't expect them to come out and burst out laughing when they do. Good job with the Darla role too, wanted to punch her too.On a final note, I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants a funny, easy-going night. For the people giving the bad reviews on this one... where is your sense of humour??? Yes the jokes are simple, and it is not very realistic, but it is a comedy movie. If you want a smart or realistic movie, go watch a documentary!",Dinner for Schmucks

Second complaint people have, is that it's mean. It isn't, how is it? *WARNING SPOILERS IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT SKIP TO NEXT PARAGRAPH* It has a happy ending, how mean can that be.

Steve Carrel was good but the weak plot made that movie worthless.There is no systematic flow. Very bad editing is probably one factor. Especially the last presentation scene was really not making any special effect which initially seems to be like a great ending. This scene was not in the Indian version so that's why maybe it was felt a little separated from the movie. Seriously that movie has lots of loop holes which greatly effect the flow.

Thank goodness I didn't go to the theater to see it, because I wouldn't have been able to throw things at the screen like I did at my T.V.Anyway, the movie is essentially about a crazy guy who follows the hero around accidentally ruining his professional life and his love life through a series of ridiculous coincidences.As for the actors, Paul Rudd is OK, but all he has to do is act exasperated. Steve Carrell is good too, but all that is required of him is to be annoying. There is nothing clever about any of the movie, but the Dinner scene had a lot of potential if the writer had been even slightly ingenious. There is one funny scene there where one of the schmucks, a black woman, does mental telepathy with the soul of the dead lobster being served for dinner. That was a riot, but that was about the extent of the true comedy.The rest was simply juvenile. Don't go see this if you are even slightly suicidal.

241,ASFan213,"Better than the trailers suggest, but not this year's Hangover",6,11 July 2010,"Being a fan of the cast, I will admit that I didn't like the trailers for this. The premise seemed a bit too mean-spirited and didn't seem like one we could really relate to, and Steve Carell seemed to be presented as a cross between Michael Scott and Sandra Bullock's character from All About Steve, in other words, very annoying and irritating. So I caught a free advanced screening because I like the cast, but was unsure if I wanted to pay to see it.I was pleasantly surprised that this made me laugh a good number of times, but I wouldn't call it this year's Hangover because it felt different. To me it was half funny and half not-so-funny and/or too weird.Pros: -The ""mouseterpieces"" were pretty inspired.-The dinner sequence was the most consistently funny part of the movie.-Jermaine Clement is the most consistently funny character of the bunch.-Paul Rudd's brunch with Steve Carell, Lucy Punch, and David Walliams was one of my personal favorite scenes.Mixed:-Steve Carell, Zach Galifianakis, and Lucy Punch all made me laugh at points, but the problem I have with their kinds of characters is that they don't really change throughout the movie, hence their routines get a bit tiresome for me.Cons: -The pacing was slower than The Hangover as well as other comedies I've seen as of late, thus I found a fair number of dull spots, particularly in the first two-thirds of the movie before the dinner. I think the movie was nearly two hours long.-Certain people like Ron Livingston and Larry Wilmore felt underused.-I like Paul Rudd and this is probably a fault of the script, but him playing the straight man has gotten kinda old. It's pretty much the same as I Love You, Man, but instead of focusing more on his social life like in that film, it focuses more on his professional life and it's not as interesting. He has some occasional quips, but the moments before he meets Steve Carell feel the most dull, and when he does meet him, Carell's outrageousness causes Rudd to take a backseat, and for a moment I forgot he was in the movie. However, like I said, this is more likely the fault of the script that causes him to just stand or sit and watch Carell rather than go head to head with him, which I believe Rudd, as a comedic actor, is capable of doing.-More about the script, I could pretty much tell how it would end, but how it got there made the ending feel rather abrupt and quite unbelievable, mainly because of how it painted Rudd up to that point. Also, the script didn't feel like it left room for much improv, something which these actors have shown to be very good at, so most of the movie felt too heavily scripted and it seemed to drag it down a bit. Additionally, I didn't find the romance aspect strong enough story-wise to make me care all that much about Rudd. Stephanie Szostak was pretty cute, but she ain't Rashida Jones, and she's not in the movie much.-This is a minor gripe, but some intense closeups were rather annoying.Bottom Line:All in all, despite my complaints, there were some good laughs to be had. It was a good one time watch, but I don't know if I'd want to pay to watch it again. However, if there were a spin off with Jermaine Clement, not unlike Russell Brand with Get Him to the Greek, I would pay to see that movie.",Dinner for Schmucks

Steve Carrell was creepy and not in the least bit funny. Zack and Paul Rudd were terrible. Zack was just weird and not at all funny. (loved him in the hangover).

Zack Galifianakis is a good addition, with his character being one of the more entertaining. Don't get me wrong it is a funny, unique story of a guy struggling to make something of himself in the business world, but they could have done so much more with the movie itself.

This movie is a good investment of your time, and I am planning another trip to the movies for Dinner once again!

Steve Carell's character Barry has been played in a similar way in both Anchorman and The Office but i find him so much more fit for this part. Himself and Zach Galifanakis are so fit for there roles but strangely i found Paul Rudd to be lacking and unfunny in this film much to contradict his characters in movies such as Role Models and Knocked Up.Needless to say, stay open-minded and control your expectations because Dinner For Schmucks is a great summer comedy that had me laughing through-out. It contains many one-liners and quotes that I am sure will be used in the future. Just remember its a memorable comedy but comedy isn't exactly the best genre for outstanding movies.

But I guess if you bring in a decent cast and enough hoopla for marketing you could sell ice to Eskimos. I set through the movie and other than a few laughters this movie is very boring and the main reason for it is the plot. It doesn't make sense and overall just a bad idea for a movie. Steve Carell is being brought over to dinner, by Paul Rudd, to make fun of and if Paul Rudd can bring the stupidest person for dinner he will get his hopeful salary raise .

The realm of absurdity can actually be hysterically funny at times, but when it isn't it's obvious the writers have horribly misjudged the envision of comedic value, and thus screwed the pooch. You then walk away hoping the film ended 15-30 minutes beforehand, just like Get him to the Greek. In fact, the weird painter Rudd's character is paranoid about, actually is very similar to Brand's Aldus Snow character in GHTTG.Bright performances: Rudd's secretary, I liked her character in a quirky Zoe Deschanel way. Rudd himself consistently good performance. The Office Ron Livingston guy not bad, but he's done better. All in all worth a buck to rent at redbox but not much more.",Dinner for Schmucks

By far this movie was lousiest piece of trash we had to endure in years.It's mean spirited, stupid, unfunny and a new low for Paul Rudd and Steve Carrel. Carrel works for the IRS but is borderline retarded and Rudd is miscast and just unfunny. Total waste of time and money. Skip the rental. Get a lobotomy instead.Sad because after seeing 40 year old virgin, I love you man and other movies these guys did, you'd figure that they would of burnt this script after reading it.

At one point about mid-way through this movie, I almost turned it off, about 6 times, but kept thinking, it can't be this bad. Well it improved enough to finish watching the movie, but that was it. It was awkward and uncomfortable. The only entertaining part was the brain power over mind power struggle, about 5 minutes of the movie, simply because you felt driven to see Barry win, other than that, a complete waste of time. You could get much more satisfaction from watching paint peel from the wall than to watch this movie. If I could, I would rate this movie below 1, because I just lost 114 minutes of my life I can't get back.",Dinner for Schmucks
252,keldabefeegle,"For comedy, better than the original.",7,31 January 2011,"Dinner for schmucks is not the clever but nasty French version, it is an American comedy with reasonable comedy value without the really mean character of the original film. I watched this film expecting to hate it. The two main actors in my view are middle of the road to less than funny in every film I have seen them in. In this film Steve Carell is the funniest I have ever seen him. He manages to pull of the comedy that the French film does not. The dialog is clever and the support cast are effective, all playing their part. I laughed a lot, was touched by certain scenes and overall it was a good watch. If you are a film lover who dislikes nastiness in films, and dislikes coming away with that unhappy feeling in your gut, then its possible you will actually like this version of the original.

But, for my money, I gotta say I almost preferred Steve Carell's version, almost... French actor Jacques Villeret was brilliant in ''Le diner de cons''(The Dinner Game), so is Carell. I also strongly appreciated the way the story was reinvented. Both movies rank in my all-time favorite comedies. I get that a lot of people were disappointed. Maybe what made the difference for me was the lukewarm reception the movie got upon it's release; I went in expecting nothing and got fairly surprised in return.

This movie after all is a message to us, to inside the good inside each one of us, to respect those good people who look like idiots, we have to take about them and stop making fun and jokes out of them, because God gave them limited skills and minds doesn't mean to make fun out of them, we have to respect them and know how they are extremely good people.I rated this movie 8 out of 10 not because it is bad, but because I believe that they should have done better filming and more scenes that can make more fun.",Dinner for Schmucks

Needless to say, it left me scratching my head. I cannot bring myself to understand how such talented actors and actresses could be convinced to be part of this project. It's like Movie 43 all over again.To be fair, I'll give thumbs up to the performances of most actors, especially Paul Rudd and Steve Carell. They did a commendable job on a shitty script.Now that that's out of of the way, I'll go right ahead and say the film tries too hard to be funny, to the point of total inanity. Granted, it has its funny moments, and I did laugh quipe sporadically throughout. However, it also has those kind of moments that make wonder what parts of your life led you to that point.I don't know or care what critics say about this film. What I know is that I watched it, and it left me hugely unsatisfied. Take that from a guy who cites comedy as his favorite genre and who lists movies like ""Idiocracy"" and ""Grown Ups 2"" among his favorite movies.Watch this if you are a prepubescent teen who loved Dumb and Dumber Too.",Dinner for Schmucks

Barry is going to be a guy who is really not an idiot but a really good guy, a little weird but incredibly cool, sensitive and he is probably going to help Paul. Paul is going to apologize to Barry and to Julie. etc.There are a few funny moments, and the acting is not so bad, specially Steve Carrell. One can argue that the cast couldn't do anything with the script, but I fault them with not choosing better scripts. For a guy or girl that is not well known, or for someone who has a difficult time getting a job, this could be a good opportunity, but not for Steve Carrell or Paul RuddI am going ahead and torture my self by finishing watching the movie.

Diner de cons is probably one of the best comedies ever made(actually a theatrical play) , the humor is just spectacular while this movie is a typical American silly comedy.I don't know why they did not stick to the original script and make something decent than just another stupid comedy.

268,strattonj-00047,A Movie for The Dumpster Fire,1,22 January 2020,"For any Steve Carell fans, like myself, Dinner For Schmucks is a must watch... if you wanna be dissapointed. Despite Steve Carell and Paul Rudd leading a well put together, beefy cast, Dinner For Schmucks is like the straight 3 you woke up with after a rage party. You never want to see her again, but you are glad you weren't sober for the act. I am a virgin that doesn't drink but this was the only way I could think of to start to describe this film. Although Steve Carell's -who plays the idiot mouse taxidermist Barry- acting was blisteringly hysterical, like always, I am willing to bet this is one of Mr. Carell's most regretted films he has ever been associated with.
After Tim (Rudd) is invited to a questionable dinner with his boss and soon to be co-workers he is tasked with finding an Idiot to bring so they can compete to see who brought the biggest idiot. Tim does this with the desire to advance in Lance Fender's (Bruce Greenwood) private equity firm so that he can impress his girlfriend Julie (Stephanie Szostak) and prove to her that he will be a good husband. After this is established the rest of the movie is just a dumpster fire full of trash scenes/jokes that look like they were thrown in because they wanted to bore you for a whole hour and 54 minutes. That being said, this film does not live up to its genre of comedy. The only funny part of the film is when Tim's ex-girlfriend comes over and tries to seduce Barry but he just thinks it's a game and they end up trashing Tim's house. The director, Jay Roach, cleverly uses common talk and uses Barry to interpret it how a 4 year old would and it's quite good fun.
The rest of the movie has a very predictable plot which makes it hard to keep focus when you know exactly what will happen next. I think they messed up Barry's character as well. He is supposed to be the dumbest idiot character but without giving anything away, ends up being one of the smartest. Steve Carell played the part perfectly however, similar to how he played Brick in Anchorman. He added comedic relief to both movies not because the actual movie was good but because he is just an amazing actor that will make you laugh in any movie he is in.
The script was also written terribly, being a comedy I would expect that it would have clever remarks and jokes but for example Barry states, ""You can drown in a teacup if you find a big enough teacup"" which is just outright hebetudinous. Overall the film is trying to teach you not to judge a book by its cover. It accomplish this task, however mundanely but it does have a good message behind all the insensibility.
If you have about two hours of your life you want to waste I would recommend you hop on Netflix and watch this film, if you don't have the time, don't watch it. Your not missing out on anything. You've probably never even heard of this movie so I'm sorry I brought its existence to your awareness.",Dinner for Schmucks

I thought '40 Year Old Virgin' and 'I Love You Man' were great so I was expecting a lot in the laughs department. The previews fooled everyone, as the dinner scene is only about the last 20 minutes. The jokes were pathetic and unfunny. I actually felt uncomfortable and found myself cringing and embarrassed for this cast, especially Carell who is such a talent.

If you expect jokes, slapstick, double entendres and a proven comedic cast who are funny in there own right you will not be disappointed.

I especially liked the contrast of the successful artist who is narcissistic and shallow with the naive hobbyist artist that makes beautiful touching mouse dioramas. The mouse dioramas are beautiful.The storyline kept me guessing, perhaps helped by the fact that I have not seen the earlier french film it is based on.

When Paul Rudd hits this dumb ass, he decides that Steve Carell is the dumb ass he wants to take to this stupid dinner for idiots. Then the movie proceeds to continue its stupid story with stupider jokes and tries to make stupid situations that attempt humor but are just stupid. I laughed more at movies like There Will Be Blood, Schindler's List, Downfall, Audition, The Lives of Others, and Winnie the Pooh. every inch of this movie seems to be made with the idea of how retarded can we be and still make money. If you want to spend two hours of your life trying to figure out why people think this movie is funny, good luck because the answer is simple. People are fagots and have terrible taste in big giant pieces of s*** like this mindless f*** hole of movie.

I wasn't too hopeful, due to all the bad reviews here. But I'm glad I went. I laughed through most of the movie, sometimes to the point of tears. My husband did, too. A few things that were too over the top, but you could tell from the get go the tone is slapstick, and I was happy to roll with that through most of the film. The talented cast had great comedic timing. The characters were not believable, but some of them were endearing. We attended a matinée on a Saturday, not opening week, so there were few people in the theater--which is normal for that situation in our theater--but the few people who were there, laughed as much as we did. Perhaps some of them had already seen it once, and liked it enough to come back. Two elderly women with a great sense of humor joked that we'd taken their usual seats, so I was having fun before the movie even started. Maybe Dinner for Schmucks will become some kind of cult classic, since those people who do like it seem to like it very much.

It dragged right from the start. There were a couple funny bits but only about $0.79 worth. I really couldn't believe Steve Carell would make a piece of junk like this. This is the kind of movie I turn off when it airs on HBO (I am hoping that HBO has better taste than to show this). Describing this as awful is being nice, real nice. This movie was stupid gag after stupid gag that had my wife and I looking at each other asking if that was supposed to be funny. There were only a couple saps in the theater but you could hear the moans and groans. On the way out there were a lot of blank stares and ""what the hell was that"" comments. It's nice to know that we were not the only ones who were stupid enough to shell out eleven bucks each for this horrible attempt at comedy.

Forget the haters and open your heart to DFS!,8,8 August 2010,"I can't believe all the bad-hype written about this movie! First of all, I'm not a fan of Steve Carrell, so I went to see this movie with some hesitation, but boy! I was already laughing before even the opening titles finished rolling! True: this movie is not for everyone, specially if you have to/like to over analyze ALL movies.... this one is not one to do that to. All I can say, without spoiling this moving for anyone, is that you WILL cringe at times. And yes, you WILL scratch your head and wonder how someone (Carrell's character) can be that naive or innocent (I actually never saw him as stupid or an idiot). The truth of the matter is that, indeed, there are well- intentioned people out there who are so genuine and gullible and nice, that for the normal-sarcastic personality-types, great people like this are an insult to their intellect. And for what I can tell from other people's reviews in here, they find them and their predicaments offensive and boring. At the end, there are great and FUNNY lessons to be found in this film if one allows it! The only thing I will agree with other people's reviews in here is that towards the middle of the movie things do-drag abit, but that's because from the start of the movie to this point, every possible thing that could go wrong to Paul Rudd's character GOES WRONG because of Carrell, which is hard to watch even though is all-funny. BUT, through some very unexpected turn of events that we learn through the length of the movie, by the time the actual dinner takes place, the movie just rolls like a non-stopping laugh-outloud ride that will have you grasping for air while taking all the 'exceptional' action going on in the screen!While I'm still not a huge fan of Carrell, he did-do a fantastic job at playing 'Barry' in a very respectable-funny way for this movie. Rudd and everyone else of the cast (and I mean really EVERYONE), also do a fantastic job at their roles. My special mention goes to Jeremain from FOTC for almost stealing this movie!At the end of the movie, I would say that 50% of the public were not happy with it and tried to leave the theater as soon as the lights went on, while the other 50% (me included), were trying to clear the tears in their eyes from laughing so much (wait after the closings titles start rolling because there's more!)Anyhow..... open your heart at 'Dinner for Smucks'!

It's no surprise.. i mean there must be a review like mine on the stupid overrated comedies i hated.Even though The 40 Year Old Virgin was one of the worst, not funny( 1 or 2 giggles in 2 long hours of stupidity) overrated comedies i have ever seen, Steve Carrell is one of very few actors who can really act funny & for me , Dinner For Schmucks was his best work since The OfficePaul Rudd always brings this nice warm feeling into a film.

It is consistently funny from start to finish, and it's able to do it with out ruining all of the best parts in the commercials. The plot isn't very substantial and I haven't seen the French film, from which it is based, but the movie was funny enough for me to enjoy it thoroughly with out being bothered by the numerous clichés in it. What makes the film as good as it is, is due in large part to the actors. Paul Rudd does a good job as the central character, practically playing the same person as he did in I Love You Man, but he gets the job done. And Steve Carrell does a great job playing an excellent moron, who delivers his lines perfectly, which is important because many of the laughs in the film come from Carrell's funny dialogue. Also Jermaine Clement finally found a film that suits his comedy, unlike Gentlemen Broncos which completely wasted him. Galifinakis is good as well, but they didn't seem to give him the free rein that he was given in The Hangover, which made the film so good, but he still isn't wasted.

Before the movie I looked at these reviews and was concerned as a few people said it was so bad they had to walk out. However, when we came out of the cinema, my boyfriend and I were saying that we couldn't understand how people found it that bad, I'm assuming they were just in a bad mood/too tired to appreciate it or something.

Most people get a few laughs out of others, so no one will hold it against you. Dinner for Schmucks is full of low brow humor , but that should be a given, considering the title of the film.Tim (Paul Rudd) is an analyst looking to move up in his financial company. In order to make the cut, he has to fit in with other executives such as Caldwell (Ron Livingston) and Williams (Larry Wilmore). The head of their financial firm, Lance Fender (Bruce Greenwood) hosts a weekly dinner where each of the executives is to bring a special guest. The guests compete for the prize of biggest idiot, but assume they are unaware of they are on display for humiliation. Tim informs his girlfriend Julie (Stephanie Szostak) of his possible promotion and the dinner, however she is appalled that Tim would go participate in the event. Tim decides against going and phones his assistant Susana (Kristen Schaal) to cancel for him. Then he runs into IRS agent Barry (Steve Carell) who bowls Tim over with his unique idiocy and Tim realizes that fate must have intervened. The rest of the film takes the audience through the lives that Tim and Julie have created, and how attending this dinner for schmucks jeopardizes everything.The cast for the film is absolutely hilarious. If you're looking for a funny movie, full of low brow humor, you'll get exactly what you paid for.

The jokes are unfunny, the plot is atrocious, the dialogs are cheesy or/and stupid to the point of absurdity, the finale is typical of a Hollywood ""blockbuster"" - everything turns out great for the main characters and we're not even sure why because the plot is so unconvincing and poor. Even the gags by Carell and Galifianakis, some of which are even amusing, cannot save this tragedy. The only proper thing I could spot is the acting.

287,cassielagrippa,Annoying and ...just annoying,1,2 January 2011,"Once a month a group of well off business execs have a dinner party where they each bring an idiot guest to make fun of (without them knowing it).Amazing to see that they (Hollywood) managed to mess up a concept that could have been so much. The budget and production seemed well enough, but then they just couldn't follow through. Unfortunately, you cannot give anything less than one star on the IMDb rating system. (I have to justify that star by giving it for the production.)Mostly, the failure of this movie is caused by the character played by Steve Carell. I'm not saying it is Carell's fault - but rather the way his character was written, and all the mindlessly annoying things he is made to do. (It could, of course, be Carell too.) These annoying things are things that nobody else would do, because they clearly cross every social boundaries, and more. This type of humor is unintelligent, infantile, has no other purpose than to annoy and possibly embarrass. The Naked Gun-series managed to pull off this type of humor, thanks to very clever copy writers, but this movie? Nah.Instead, watch the movie that ""inspired"" this one, called The Dinner Game (Le Diner De Cons) (7.7): http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119038/ It has the finesse, subtlety and humor that characterize good French movies.I laughed out loud many times during The Dinner Game. Not once during Dinner For Scmucks. Actually, I found myself wanting to turn this movie off so many times, but I kept watching, to see if by some miracle it turned to the better. It didn't.",Dinner for Schmucks

As with most comedy movies, it also had a bit of a moral to it, which I also enjoyed. I'm not really sure what I'd name the humor, but if you like to make fun of people (to a degree... I suppose) then you'll probably like this movie. If you can't believe stupid people, I also probably suggest you go and see this movie.",Dinner for Schmucks
289,gotku,Disappointing...,1,20 December 2010,"1st time i'm writing a review on IMDb, but i had to say how bad is this movie.Im french and the original movie ""Le diner de con"" was one of the funniest movies have ever seen. I still can remember the 1st time i seen it in theater 12 years ago. Like all the people in the room i laugh my ass of. I cry by laughing so hard during all the movie (sorry for my English). And every time i saw it again on video, the magic still workingThe only time i laugh in ""Dinner for Schmucks"" was in the very beginning when we see the mouses pictures. I thought it was well found , a good idea for the lobby of the ""idiot"". After that, nothing... Few smiles in the first part of the movie but thats all. Im a big fan of Steve Carrel but in this movie his character is too idiot, its too much. The reason why the original movie was that funny its because its was realistic in a way. Her its just too much and for me it make it loose all the fun. And its like that for all the character and the situation.The reason the original was so funny, and was such a huge success when it was released in France,it is because the writing was very well done, very subtle. ""The idiot"" is funny because he is clumsy, do some stuffs too quick without thinking of the aftermaths, but he is not in any way somebody that look like he escape from an asylum with 10 of IQ like Carrel character in this remake..Very hard to go to the end of this movie.. In fact during watching it i had to check on IMDb to see some reviews to see if i was the only one who didn't laugh at all. Im surprise to see that many people finding this one hilarious. May be the fact i see the original movie, knowning the mecanic of the script. But i try to see this one with a fresh eye.Anyway it doesn't work, and this one is the worst movie iv seen this year. My English isn't good enough to express what i fell about this movie but for me its a waste, a shame consedering the original material, as i said its my first review her but i had to warm people. My only advice, watch the original.It is a typical Hollywood failed remake when the writter thought ""let's make the schmuck even stupidier so it will be even funnier!!!"" Nope... it doesn't work like this.Again, sorry for my English, i just hope you get the the point.",Dinner for Schmucks

The only funny actors in the film are Chris O'Dowd and Zach Galafianakis, and they only serve minor roles in the film. However there are some funny parts in the film but I think that the overall terribleness of the film outweighs that.If you love unwitty slapstick humor then feel free to watch this film it will suit you. But there's nothing original in this film just a painfully stupid plot.Terrible film.

Worst movie I've seen in 5 years! And sadly my last film was Inception. To go from such an excellent film to this one was painful. Save your hard earned dollars and rent one tonight... this one is FUBAR'd.. I felt in some ways they tried to copy getting to the Greek and just really missed the boat. The cast all fit very well except, you've guessed it Steve Carrol. Honestly, if you enjoy his humor as I have in the past SKIP THIS MOVIE.

It's ridiculous in real life but thats why its not. It's fake, sorry to tell you, but that's why you can just sit back and enjoy it. And Steve Carrell's character Barry is irritating? Wow detective, thanks for pointing that out. That's the whole idea, he's irritating and crazy so you sympathize with Paul Rudd's character and when Rudd comes around on Barry's side you do too!

I desperately tried to find it funny...I may have giggled twice and once was because I just couldn't believe I was watching such stupidity...and it wasn't the funny kind of stupid either. It was just plain dumb. Also, I was absolutely shocked that a movie rated PG13 would have such strong sexual content! There were only tiny feathers covering up body parts 13 year olds should not even be encouraged to look at! Also, blatantly talking about sex, having sex, and having sex with multiple people at the same time is not exactly the content a 13 year old should be watching either! There were many MANY other references to sex or sexual behavior as well. Also, the language was terrible. The F-bomb was even dropped...in a PG13 movie!! Seriously, who rated this and what guideline did they use if any? Don't waste your time or money on this. Even if you aren't moral...it was just plain boring and dumb.

It was full of genuine humor, and it even contained some of the most heart-wrenching scenes that I've seen in years. Most of all the movie had a message, which generally isn't something you see in many modern day light comedies, such as the hangover and all. Also, speaking of movies such as the hangover, the jokes were generally a lot more involved and some even required some thinking to get(such as when Therman, the mind controller states how ""the brain, like all other muscles, have pressure points which can be pushed,"" which becomes pretty hilarious after you realize the brain isn't a muscle.

Plus the major actors, Steve Carell and Paul Rudd, stay in character so well.Paul Rudd, plays the ambitious character trying to climb the corporate latter so his girl friend, the strikingly pretty Stephanie Szostak, will marry him.

My wife insisted so I tagged along. While I'm not a huge fan of Steve Carrell, I have enjoyed him in some of his movies. I also have liked Paul Rudd as well. That being said, this movie is utterly terrible. The entirety of the first 100 minutes of the run time is an agonizing journey that at times is physically painful with how the situations are so predictably unfunny. Steve Carrell's character is so annoying that it really was impossible to feel sorry for him by the end which I think was what the movie was going for.Once you finally make it to the dinner (if you haven't walked out by then) which I mistakenly expected to be a more prominent part of the film based on trailers and that the movie title is, in fact, DINNER for Schmucks, the movie actually is quite entertaining with only a few instances of groan-inducing ""humor."" Then, 15 minutes later, the movie is blessedly over.

298,darth_helios,Dinner much sucks,3,20 August 2010,"Before I begin my review I have to say that am a big fan of Steve Carell and loved some previous work of Jay Roach. So this movie was a must watch for me. I went in without reading any reviews and came out feeling sorry for putting myself through the movie. It had it's moments. But most of the movie felt bland. Steve does an OK job at playing the schmuck. But much of his potential as an actor is underutilized. The title itself is a misnomer as the actual dinner doesn't start till 3rd act. Much of the first two acts is spent in developing an uncomfortable bonding between the lead actors. This is where it killed the movie for me. I came to see a comedy but it felt more like a drama movie. Last act was better that first two. But it was too little too late. What worked for me : 1. ""Mousterpieces"" - Mice, dead or alive, never looked so cute all dressed up. Those dioramas through out the movie were great. 2. Zach Galifianakis's character takes himself so seriously that it was funny...sometimes. What didn't work: 1. Many situations that the two leads find themselves in felt forced and unoriginal. 2. Any guy could have played Paul Rudd's character. It was so underwhelming from a comedy movie point of view. 3. They tried to make it a comedy movie with a message but it took frustratingly long to get to the message and rarely felt like a comedy movie.Moviegoers beware",Dinner for Schmucks

Instead of subtitling the original, they went for a remake à la sauce américaine. Just as in the case of The Vanishing, La Femme Nikita, Un Indien Dans la Ville, Le Grand Chemin and a dozen other films (at least), the remake is just plain awful. Steve Carell is reprising the late and much-regretted role played by Jacques Villeret.

301,redemptorofpugency,Hollywood surprised me ... finally.,9,13 September 2010,"Despite its misleading, preposterous title, this is one of the most intellectually challenging movies of the decade. Hidden beneath a fine layer of sparkling jokes (a vast majority of the audience won't notice anything else), the subtle, Matryoshka-like construction unfolds a very unusual and surprising plot. Film director Jay Roach, best known for directing the ""not-that-deep"" Austin Powers films, now pursues a completely different track, which he had already foreshadowed in ""Recount"" (2008), and joins the league of gods among Charlie Chaplin and Woody Allen. Roach combines Jungian archetypes (not to reveal to much of the plot, just notice that Tim corresponds to the Anima) with satire and a scathing criticism on society and the American way of life.

My favorites were David Walliams of ""Little Britian"" fame and Chris O'Dowd of ""The IT Crowd."" Germaine Clement's character was probably the most engaging of all, even overshadowing Steve Carell's. If you are a fan of Clement, this is a must see. The style was zany and nonsensical in the way that many British Comedies are. Although it wasn't the greatest film ever, I certainly believe it deserves 9 out of 10 stars.

303,mkusafr,I was the crazy loud laugher in the back!,9,25 September 2010,"I read the reviews on this and I couldn't believe how many people really didn't like it. But, to each their own.1. Watch ""Diner des Cons"" first. It is very different humor (French), slower (French), and a lot like the remake but yet the remake took off from it - so you won't get the same thing. The ""con"" (idiot) is (was?) an amazing French actor and his character... excruciating to watch. In fact almost the whole movie is. But it is really art (and if you study theater... uses the ""Unite' des temps"" which I don't know in English - takes place in 24 hours and in ""one"" location) and finely crafted! And you should watch this first because to watch this after: a. you won't see the nods to the original and b. it will probably be hard to watch this version after (like reading a book after).2. You truly and absolutely don't need to watch the first to ""get it"". Our 12 year old and 16 year old kids loved the movie (though a very few jokes were maybe a little too sexual for the 12 year... the world today). Anyway, they laughed tons. They understood the greater meaning. We quoted the movie and laughed on the way home!3. Francis Veber is one of my favorite French directors. Maybe I'm biased then to like this remake? But also, it made me very critical and standards were quite high... I was leery of what Hollywood might do to it... and ended up pleased. I laughed a lot.4. I love Steve Carrell, Zach G, Germaine, et al. Really felt they fit and played their roles very well. I really do think it was Steve to his finest! To say this is just to make fun at the people at dinner (mean spirited), don't realize the greater theme - which I think is there. That theme is present more if you see the original first. I can be one that doesn't laugh easily but they had me and many times I didn't see the joke coming - which makes a laugh out loud situation. The character ""con"" might be hard to watch - but not as nearly as the French version where I almost wanted to rip out my hair - but isn't that sort of good - play with the boundary of uncomfortable...?5. It IS an ""Americanized"" version and ""expansion"" of the French... so it will different. It is funny to the American sense of humor like I laughed (chuckled) to the French sense of humor in the original. (I'm span both sides). There is a blend, I think, but it couldn't be successful here if not ""americanized"" in humor and culture, yet keeps the nods and such to the French. I find the blend successful. Remakes are hard - but I think this one was a success in spirit and in form.6. It's not just me who loved it. The theater - one of the ""loudest"" comedies I've seen. I heard belly laughs, chuckles, etc.See for yourself...... I don't know if you'll like it be we sure did.",Dinner for Schmucks

I have to stick my neck out on this one but I enjoyed it. I like my comedies, from the classics to the obscure, and this feature manages to slot itself in there somewhere. It's not rip roaringly funny but it makes you smile, makes you giggles and still manages to create a personal attachment to the characters. When they feel bad, we feel bad. When they put themselves through awkward, cringe-worthy situations we cringe along with them and we all end up laughing at the other end.Stop trying to take this film seriously, it's not trying to be a serious film. It's about a group of idiots being shown of for being idiots by a bunch of corporate idiots. It's silly, fun and worth seeing.I found the acting was good, little ropey in places but general was to standard, the direction was well thought out, the cinematography was clever and the set design and props (especially the mice) were all manufactured so well and realistically they helped to hold the film together.

If you are a fan of that series, you will surely love ""Dinner for Schmucks"". The humour was excellent, and the idea was great. I thought the line-up of actors was also a good choice, and fitted this movie very well. I give this a 10/10, and, it is by far, one of the funniest movies released in 2010.This movie certainly never lost it's audience; with the story constantly flipping and twisting, it kept you focused and watching. I never lost interest, nor did I ever refrain from laughter. This is probably something I could watch over and over and never get tired of. I really do not understand how it could not be liked, but for it being inappropriate for younger viewers at times. Two thumbs up for the actor playing ""Therman"" - he was spectacular in the hangover, playing ""Allan"", and has definitely shown that same humour in ""Dinner for Schmucks"".

And funny it is. Steve Carell is hilarious as a dimwitted simpleton, and Paul Rudd plays his character well. It does, admittedly, start a bit slow, but as the scenes unfold it just gets funnier and funnier. The dinner scene had me and my entire family rolling on the couches in laughter.

His character and his acting in this one were not up to par. You would think he could pull this one off, but his character was so unrealistic, that you simply could not believe it. Paul Rudd played his typical type character but it did not work this time either.

On the night where Pierre and his ""schmuck are supposed to go to dinner Pierre hurts his back and is unable to attend the dinner, therefore the evening takes a very strange turn of events including his wife's ex-husband an I.R.S inspector and a car accident.When David Guion and Michael Handelman put there hands on this script not only did they change the whole idea of the movie they also transformed it's meaning, the original version had a deeply ironic tone in which Francois Pignon (Tim) trying to do the right thing makes everything worse whereas in this version everything finishes well.In the American remake the movie is filled with an insane artist, a crazy ex-girlfriend and a psychic nemesis. The American company responsible for this release turned into ridicule a French classic. The message of hope conveyed in the movie is feeble and not believable in any way. Overall Big Brother has come in with a big wallet and once again transformed a French masterpiece into a ridiculous feel-good American production. The only positive note is the act of both Steve Carell and Paul Rudd who despite a shaky scenario manage to pull off a great performance.To sum-up I highly recommend the original version and advise you to stay away from the American re-make.",Dinner for Schmucks
317,Kurukua,Movie for schmucks,1,23 July 2011,"Omg. I can't believe i wasted 2 hours of my life watching this movie. 2 hours I will NEVER get back. Please, don't waste your time. This movie owes me 5 stars! If you are watching it expecting it to get better, give it up. It won't. I don't understand how quality actors can make such junk! Who edits these movies? I would HATE to see the scenes that ended up on the cutting room floor. Usually, I enjoy both Steve Carell and Paul Rudd. And the actress who plays Julie is quite charming. I couldn't get enough of Zach g in the hangover movies! But wow, was this a mistake for all of them. Glad I didn't spend money on this one!",Dinner for Schmucks
318,kittie2110,Could not finish it,1,27 July 2011,"OK, well I gave a one out of 10 because there is no way to give a zero apparently. oh well.. I will make this review short because it is not worth my time to explain why this movie is so bad. First, being French, I know the original movie and it brakes my heart that they sold the rights for a piece of garbage like this. I mean, the cast is not too bad, so I was expecting a little better, but oh my god, I did not even finish watching the movie, this is how bad it was. They took it way too far, every single joke, it was just painful. and I think it is the first time I do not finish a movie... going back to the original movie, which was so good, so funny and became so popular in France, that you would know the lines coming up next as you watched the movie so many time, it is such a disgrace that Americans butcher the whole movie like that. If you are going to remake an excellent movie like "" Le diner de cons"" at least, make it watchable.",Dinner for Schmucks
319,agrawalashish05,Though a Copy from Bollywood.. Worth a Watch !!,7,22 April 2013,"Its an copy from a 2007 Bollywood movie ""Bheja Fry"" while the original is way too good , this one is not bad either.Steve Carell is too good as a dumb worth a watch no doubt especially for him. Paul Rudd is although not very good when it came to expressing irritation and frustration.Steve's mouse and his depiction of certain historical figures using mouse is too sweet. Other star cast has done quite a decent job.. Message of being dreamer is certainly inspiring and convincing by a dejected and sad Steve.Indians although can prefer Bheja Fry over this one. ""Vinay Pathak"" was 10 times better.",Dinner for Schmucks
320,ablurid,"Very disappointing, awful writers",4,15 October 2018,"I'm French and I have to say, I was very excited when I found out Le Dîner de Cons was going to have a remake, and I thought it could be ok, since the American remake of LOL was pretty good. I was mainly enticed by the idea of Paul Rudd playing the normal dude and Steve Carell playing the idiot. I thought it would be a brilliant cast.So I watched a few years ago and I hated it. So much so that I had given it a 1 on here to balance out the good critics. But after seeing the Anchorman movies and enjoying Brick's character, I thought I should give this a second chance without thinking of it as a remake.It simply didn't make me laugh. It was way too over the top, Steve Carell's character is too dumb, and in Anchorman it works because everybody's dumb. Here the two main characters don't fit together at all, and the writing is just not funny enough. It is a waste of a very good concept and two wonderful comedic actors.The reason I give it 4 stars now (and I think I am being nice):
1 star for Paul Rudd whose character was ok (although it could be so much more)1 star for the French actress who hints that the original is French (although a cameo of one of the actors in original movie would have been even better, yes I know Jacques Villeret is long gone, but any of the living ones)1 star for the fact that they actually went to dinner, which is something I always wished to see more of in the original, but again a waste of a good idea1 star for the moral of the story which is clearer here than in the original, aka don't be mean to people even if you think they are idiots. They still should have included the phrase 'we are all someone else's idiot'",Dinner for Schmucks

322,gnagy-633-88543,Best movie of the decade,10,15 March 2013,"I think it's Steve Carrell's best performance ever. The only person not the best fit was Galifianakis. In his office scened he overplayed his weirdo character perfect for deleted scenes. Good scene but not for the plot. Carrell's character was lovable yet disturbing in a way that no one before him played. I would say: better deeper and more touching that the original one. It's made to make a statement for all the weirdos out there who deserve to be loved.There is not much to be said about Rudd, he is just sweet and funny as always. He's cast in so many movies it should have gone to Luke Wilson. Seeing the staff of the daily show was a huge plus!",Dinner for Schmucks
323,jonny_t96,A great movie! Ignore the naysayers if you're in for a fun laugh,10,3 September 2014,"This movie may not be the ""best"" movie out there, but it is fun and enjoyable if you have an easy-going sense of humor, instead of looking for Oscar in everything. Some great laughs and an all around fun time when viewing this movie. I believe that Steve Carrel was honestly perfect for this character and Paul Rudd portrayed the stressed office worker as you would imagine he does. Please give this movie a go and if you don't like it please don't rate it badly because others may. I almost didn't try this movie because of the rating on here buy I am very very glad that I did because it was very enjoyable.I can't stress enough hoe much this movie is great. I have to write extra lines so that this website will accept this review, and I want all of you to get to see it. If you are in this just for a chilled out laugh, rather than one that it is over criticised and analysed, then this movie is highly appropriate",Dinner for Schmucks
324,jedithang,Hilarious,10,1 August 2010,"Dinner for Schmucks is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time. I love comedies, but very few make me laugh out loud - but this movie had me bursting out every couple of minutes. I was not alone in that, the theater I saw it in was packed and everyone was in hysterics. Some reviews on here actually complain that it is ""low brow"" or ""stupid"" - seriously? Where you expecting a deep and insightful movie? Had you seen the previews? Is it realistic? Of course not (not many movies are - it is called suspension of disbelief). The point of a comedy is to make you laugh. Going in with expectations of anything high brow is absurd. If you like The Office or 40 Year Old Virgin, then you will love this movie - it is in a similar vein, but much cleaner than 40 Year Old Virgin. In fact, it is surprisingly funny for a PG-13 film. Can't understand any of the bad reviews - if you like Steve Carell, Paul Rudd and Jay Roach movies - then this is for you - one of the funniest projects any of them has been involved in.",Dinner for Schmucks
325,rmcb-25333,Movies for schmucks,3,14 September 2020,"By the time it got to the actual dinner, it felt like the producers of this film along with rudd, odowd, carrel, clement and galifiniakis were the rich dudes. And they'd invited viewers to watch this film. And if you made it this far into the film, you're a schmuck. I'm a schmuck. We're the schmucks. I felt shame. But shame on them. Shame on them.",Dinner for Schmucks
326,rcmainville,Dinner For Schmucks Review,6,16 March 2020,"The comedy is funny at first, but quickly becomes repetitive only to be drawn out the rest of the movie.",Dinner for Schmucks
327,MoviegoerYes,Movie for Schmucks!!,1,3 August 2010,"I don't think I have ever watched a worse movie in my whole life! The movie started at 7 and by 7:30 I was trying to get out of there! I did not hear anybody laugh throughout the whole movie and there were a lot of young adults and teenagers watching the movie but it was scary quiet in there, at the very least I knew I wasn't the only one hating the film. What hurts me the most is the two hours I lost and can never get back! I didn't pay for it and I am very glad about that! It is so disappointing how such great actors fell for such horrible script! I agree with all negative reviews posted, this is by far the biggest disappointment ever. Please don't waste ANY of your money on this crappy movie, wait for it to come out on TNT!!!",Dinner for Schmucks
