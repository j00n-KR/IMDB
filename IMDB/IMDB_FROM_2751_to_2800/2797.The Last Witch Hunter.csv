0,Leofwine_draca,Cookie cutter film-making,4,24 July 2016,"THE LAST WITCH HUNTER is yet another bland and soulless Hollywood blockbuster CGI adventure that looks and feels exactly like SEASON OF THE WITCH, RIPD, MEN IN BLACK, plus at least a dozen others released in the last decade. I think it's a real shame that these films have no distinctiveness or visual style over their own, which renders them instantly forgettable to the viewer.The hulking but oddly bland Vin Diesel stars as an immortal witch hunter who goes around dispatching evil witches with the aid of priest Elijah Wood (wasted in an under-written part). Eventually he comes up against an age-old evil and soon a battle commences which is packed with the usual CGI action: it looks pretty but artificial, lacking depth and believability. Even worse, the child-friendly certificate means that this film's attempts to be genuinely scary fall by the wayside. Imagine this as a hard adult horror packed with violence and gore, and you might have something halfway decent.Films like THE LAST WITCH HUNTER aren't inherently bad, it's just their lack of originality and their contentedness to copy what's come before that gets to me. The most interesting thing about this production are the supporting cast members: Icelandic actor Olafur Darri Olafsson is full of gravitas, Rose Leslie oddly appealing, Joseph Gilgun briefly crazy, Michael Caine typically steadfast, and Julie Engelbrecht makes for the single decent CGI effect. The rest is just loud noise and nonsense that you'll happily forget about mere moments after watching.",The Last Witch Hunter
1,SnoopyStyle,not for Vin Diesel,5,5 June 2016,"In the middle ages, Kaulder (Vin Diesel) and other witch hunters attack the Witch Queen. He's cursed by her with eternal life. In the modern world, he has been a witch hunter for 800 years policing a truce between witches and the church. The 36th Dolan (Michael Caine) is elderly and the 37th Dolan (Elijah Wood) is preparing to take over. A Dolan is a priest who keeps Kaulder's records and is his handler. 36th is murdered by a darker mysterious witch. Kaulder is reluctantly joined by witch Chloe (Rose Leslie).This is not a slam against Vin Diesel. He does what he does very well. This is not what he does. This seems to be a darker and more mysterious character. He's not a nuanced actor. The witchcraft battles are interesting at times but also confusing at other times. I have nothing against Vin Diesel trying to stretch his wings but he's unable to make this one fly.",The Last Witch Hunter
2,Prismark10,The Last Witch Hunter,4,28 February 2021,"Flat, uninspired and derivative. Once the narration starts you begin to think what possessed Michael Caine to phone in his performance.A big fat cheque I presume will be his answer.Vin Diesel is out of gas as the 800 year old immortal witch hunter Kaulder. Made immortal by a curse from the witch queen.In the modern day, there is peace between the witches and the church. Co-existence that is about to be shattered.The priest Dolan 36th (Michael Caine) who is Kaulder's assistant and liaison with the church has retired. To be replaced by Dolan 37th (Elijah Wood) who once met Kaulder.Now someone is attacking Kaulder, someone with power and a grudge.There is little magic here just a bigger budget and more noise. The story is plodding, a major twist does not come as a surprise.At least there are some nice action scenes, a bit of humour but so many underwritten characters.",The Last Witch Hunter
3,claudio_carvalho,The Witch Hunter and the Witch Queen,7,7 February 2016,"In the Middle Ages, the witch hunter Kaulder (Vin Diesel) hunts down the Witch Queen (Julie Engelbrecht) with the inhabitants of towns devastated by the black plague that she had spread.. The Witch Queen curses Kaulder with eternal life to make him suffer the loss of his wife and daughter for the eternity.Eight hundred years later, there is a balance in the world and the witches live peacefully among humans. The witch hunter Kauder and The Axe and Cross that judges and imprisons witches in the darkness are the responsible for keeping the world in peace. The priest Dolan 36th (Michael Caine) is the liaison between The Axe and Cross and Kauder, giving support and keeping the record of his life. On the same day of his retirement, Dolan 36th dies alone in his apartment. Kauder goes to his apartment with Dolan 37th (Elijah Wood) to investigate his death and finds black magic in the spot. Further, he finds that Dolan 36th is still alive under a powerful spell. Now Kauder visits the witch Chloe (Rose Leslie), who owns a witch bar, to seek her help to recall his own death following clues left by Dolan 36th. However the bar is attacked and destroyed by the witch Beliel (Ólafur Darri Ólafsson) and Kauder leaves Chloe under his protection. When she uses her abilities to help Kauder, he learns a dreadful secret about his immortality. ""The Last Witch Hunter"" is an entertaining fantasy with lots of action and special effects. The excellent cast with Michael Caine, Vin Diesel, Rose Leslie and Elijah Wood give pedigree to the adventure. The conclusion is prepared for a sequel with Kauder's discovery. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""O Último Caçador de Bruxas"" (""The Last Witch Hunter"")",The Last Witch Hunter
4,kosmasp,Worth saving (?),6,1 March 2016,"Sometimes you really wonder and struggle to answer a simple question. It's even tougher to portray a character who is seemingly invincible, but make him approachable. There's something missing in the life of the Witch Hunter, but he seems to cool for school for anyone to actually feel that void or any pain/sympathy for his ""wordly"" problems (if you can actually spot any).Vin Diesel and Hopkins are doing a good job, even in their dialog early on, that could've gone completely off the rails. They sort of keep it on track, while some of the viewers may still wonder what that awkward moment tried to achieve. There is a reason of course and while this movie is as predictable as they come, it still can be fun to watch",The Last Witch Hunter
5,BA_Harrison,"Eye of newt, and toe of frog, The Last Witch Hunter is a bit of a dog.",4,4 December 2017,"Breck Eisner's The Last Witch Hunter is the epitome of bland, a muddled mishmash of wholly unoriginal ideas pilfered from a range of other fantasy films, the whole thing thrown together with little concern for coherence and given a slick CGI makeover to try and convince punters that they're getting their money's worth. What viewers actually get is a showy mess that makes one wonder how such cookie-cutter drivel ever gets the green-light in the first place.Star Vin Diesel is forgettable as Kaulder, a witch-hunter who was cursed centuries ago with immortality by a witch queen (Julie Engelbrecht), and who has spent his everlasting life hunting down those who practise dark magic. Michael Caine plays Kaulder's church sanctioned assistant Dolan 36th who is killed by an evil sorceror, and Elijah Wood is his replacement, Dolan 37th, who joins Kaulder in the search for those who seek to resurrect the witch queen. Also lending a hand is good witch Chloe (Rose Leslie).After lots of confusing, special effects driven action and dreary supernatural drama, the film ends in a manner that suggests it was intended to be the beginning of a franchise. Given how poorly the movie was received, I think that there is a witch's chance in Salem of that happening.",The Last Witch Hunter
6,hitchcockthelegend,"You cling to your pathetic life, those closest to you betray you and those you claim to protect don't even know your name.",5,31 March 2019,"Hmm, okies. It feels like the studio execs sat around the big table and thought here's Vin Diesel lets build a boisterous popcorn franchise setting piece around him.Plot has Diesel as the title character who here in the modern world is all that stands between humanity and the combined forces of the deadliest witches in history. Cue lots of crash bang and wallop, digital blitzkrieg and Vin with a glint in his eye, this in spite of not having the emotional paths required for the role. In support are Elijah Wood, Michael Caine and Rose Leslie, all of whom arguably come under the miscast banner.There's some smart ideas at the film's core, the nightmares and dreamscapes narrative smarts particularly hint at what might have been a potent asset to the pic. There's some nifty set-pieces on show as well, which just about stops this from being a boring picture - but it comes mightily close - and in HD form it looks and sounds terrific. Yet sadly it's never a fully realised whole for dramatic impact, with the casting decisions only compounding this feeling.In nutshell terms The Last Witch Hunter is a passable time waster that entertains if one is in an undemanding mood. 5/10",The Last Witch Hunter
7,CinemaSerf,"""Try doing that with an iPad""",6,23 October 2020,"Following the defeat of their wicked queen many, many years ago, an uneasy truce exists between witches and man - the former being permitted to co-exist so long as they don't use their magic. Vin Diesel is ""Kaulder"" the last of a breed of witch hunters; their job being to enforce this truce and to bring to justice any transgressors. Aided by a ""Dolan"" - a human priest - he has managed to survive for over 800 years until his 36th one - Sir Michael Caine - is attacked and cursed. Now he must try to break this curse and free his friend before it kills him. As his investigations deepen, he discovers that the race is now on to stop the evil witch queen for resurrecting and wreaking havoc on all humanity! It's quite a fun fantasy adventure held together fairly well by Diesel and Rose Leslie (""Chloe"") with the odd intervention from a curiously cast Elijah Wood as the 37th ""Dolan"" and, of course, Caine. The story is pretty formulaic, and there is practically no doubt about the outcome - but the effects are quite decent, as is the imagination of writer Cory Goodman in weaving some less obvious threads into the story. There are far more sophisticated, better crafted, fantasy adventures out there, but this one is perfectly watchable nonetheless.",The Last Witch Hunter
8,zardoz-13,Hex-Rated Rubbish!!!,1,2 November 2015,"""The Last Witch Hunter"" casts spells that are far from inspired and mediocre at best. ""Dungeons & Dragons"" aficionado Vin Diesel toplines this ponderous, PG-13 rated pabulum as an 800-year old protagonist who struggles with the help of the Catholic Church to preserve a precarious peace between witches and mankind. Not only does Diesel appear incredibly miscast as an immortal ""Highlander"" type medieval warrior careening around contemporary New York City in a sports car, but also this witchy washy yarn doesn't surpass superior witchcraft fantasies such as ""Snow White and The Huntsman"" (2012) and ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"" (2013). The chief problem with this lavishly-produced, CGI-laden extravaganza is that it takes itself far too seriously. Apart from its dire shortage of humor, this dreary potboiler suffers from a dearth of quotable dialogue, banal adversaries, and second-rate supporting characters. Gifted thespians like Oscar-winner Michael Caine and Elijah Wood shrivel in lackluster roles as our hero's sidekicks who are designated as 'Dolans.' ""Sahara"" director Breck Eisner and three scenarists, Cory Goodman of ""Priest"" along with Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless of ""Dracula Untold,"" have conjured up a synthetic storyline that generates neither charisma nor spectacle. Actually, they appear to have imitated the sensational Wesley Snipes' vampire saga ""Blade"" right down to its rebirth of an ancient blood demon. Similarly, ""The Last Witch Hunter"" should have bristled with non-stop momentum, violently outlandish combat sequences, and a coherently contrived mythology. Instead, it degenerates into a dreary mumbo-jumbo melodrama. The most ambitious CGI scene pits our hero against a clumsy beast known as 'the Sentinel,' and he destroys behemoth with a sword as if he were a bullfighter straddling it. This unruly creature resembles a huge tiger that appears as it if were assembled from wicker and features a jet engine afterburner for its gullet. Our hero's chief adversary is a hideous Witch Queen swarming with creepy crawlies who looks like she has spent too many centuries in a mud bath. Moreover, she boasts none of the imaginative flamboyance of Charlize Theron's enchantress in ""Snow White and the Huntsman."" ""The Last Witch Hunter"" unfolds during the chilly Middle Ages. A group of stalwart souls armed with swords trudge through snow-swept, mountainous terrain to storm an eerie cluster of haunted trees. A despicable looking dame known as the Witch Queen (Julie Engelbrecht of the TV mini-series ""The Strain"") inhabits this stronghold raging with fire and brimstone. Predictably, she isn't glad to see these bearded gate-crashers with their religious iconography. This homicidal hag with her hatred for mankind has already decimated humanity with a black plague and incurred our hero's wrath. The Witch Queen's pestilence exterminated our hero's wife and daughter, and his happier times with them are recounted in several flashbacks. When Kaulder (Vin Diesel with dwarfish dreadlocks) and the Witch Queen tangle, our fearless witch hunter skewers her with his flaming sword and finishes her off. Ironically, Kaulder survives this trial by combat, but his survival becomes a tribulation. ""I curse you,"" howls the wounded witch. ""You'll never know peace. You will never die.""Afterward, ""The Last Witch Hunter"" shifts its setting from the 13th century to the 21st century. Our brawny, shaven-headed hero with neither dwarfish facial fuzz nor noggin fur prowls a passenger jet as it encounters foul weather. Actually, an ignorant young witch has smuggled a dangerous collection of runes aboard the aircraft, and she is to blame for the increment weather. Naturally, our erudite hero invokes his age-old wisdom and defuses these volatile artifacts. Nothing about this scene creates either suspense or excitement. As his own personal reward, Kaulder seduces a nubile stewardess before he sits down for the last time with his 36th Dolan (Michael Caine of ""The Dark Knight""), a revered Catholic cleric who has spent the last 50 years chronicling our protagonist's escapades for posterity. Incidentally, Dolans are members of a covert Axe and Cross society within the Catholic Church. Like Kaulder, they have devoted themselves to maintaining an uneasy truce between humans and witches. In ""The Last Witch Hunter,"" witches walk the earth with mankind, just as vampires did in ""Blade,"" but few people know about their phantasmagorical presence. Kaulder and the clerics act as intermediaries who work alongside the crafty Witch Counsel to keep these necromancers in line. Kaulder captures witches who illegally practice black magic, and the Witch Counsel entomb them in a maze of caves.The 36th Dolan is poised to retire, and the 37th Dolan (Elijah Wood of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy) prepares to replace him. Although he saved the 37th Dolan from a coven of witches, Kaulder doesn't immediately recognize this newcomer. Meantime, dramatic complications occur when the 36th Dolan appears to have been murdered under mysterious circumstances by a shape-shifting sorcerer. Kaulder discovers black magic at the scene of the crime and suspects that his ancient adversary, the Witch Queen, may have been playing possum all those years. Along the way, Kaulder recruits a 'good' witch Chloe (Rose Leslie from ""Game of Thrones"") to help him sort out the mystery. Chloe's claim to fame is her ability to cavort in dreams. Happily, she rescues Kaulder from one disastrous dream after another when the Witch Queen's evil cronies attack him on several occasions. Our hero believes the solution to his quandary lies within his ""Matrix"" like dreams.Ultimately, ""The Last Witch Hunter"" is largely incomprehensible gobbledygook. Eisner and his scribes have enormous problems mapping out their complex witchcraft mythology. They sprinkle bread crumbs of information about these conjurers throughout the muddled melodramatics, but seldom does anything about them come across as palatable. Two surprises occur during these sluggish shenanigans, but neither are genuine revelations if you have paid attention to the formulaic plot. The villains don't stand out from the background, and the Witch Queen is stuck in the mud from the start. Eisner orchestrates several big-budget action scenes, but these emerge as sloppy exercises. Altogether, ""The Last Witch Hunter"" qualifies as hex-rated rubbish.",The Last Witch Hunter
9,oscaralbert,"""Who says witches can't kill . . . """,7,26 October 2015,""" . . . witches?"" asks Chloe the Witch of THE LAST WITCH HUNTER. I suppose that title character player Vin Diesel could have objected ""Then I wouldn't be THE LAST WITCH HUNTER any more, and they'd have to change all the posters."" Or he could have told Chloe that he already was getting a lot of help from BATMAN's butler, and he didn't need Jack Bauer's go-fer from the CTU to butt in. Maybe he felt that Chloe was better suited for FAST AND FURIOUS 8, given the way she drove off like a bat out of Hell the first time he gave her his car keys. Or maybe he thought that since people went around killing other people all the time, why shouldn't witches kill other witches? As they say, what's sauce for the goose is sauce for the salamander. Though Abraham Lincoln's turn as a vampire hunter already has been taken, there are plenty of other dead American presidents Hollywood can call up. How about Ronald Reagan? He never was drafted during World War II due to his Tinsel Town deferment, which makes him the perfect candidate to headline RONALD REAGAN: FELLOW VAMPIRE HUNTER.",The Last Witch Hunter
10,view_and_review,Make Sure this is the Last Witch Hunter,5,31 July 2019,"The Last Witch Hunter was very formulaic and dull.Vin Diesel plays Kaulder a witch hunter from the middle ages. I'm saying middle ages but I don't know for sure. When were the Vikings prominent because he looked like a Viking. In any case; he and his squad were hunting the Witch Queen (Julie Engelbrecht) because she had released the black plague on mankind.*That's another clue: he looked like a Viking, the black plague was killing people and it was 800 years ago.Klauder was able to corner the Witch Queen and deliver a fatal blow with his sword. Before she expired she ""cursed"" him with immortality. 800 years later he's still hunting witches but there is a better relationship between witches and humans. Witches do their own thing, not bothering humans, and the witch hunter leaves them alone.Because Hollywood lacks imagination they figured out a way to bring the Witch Queen back to life. Again, because Hollywood lacks imagination, there was a girl brought into the picture who would have to fall in love with the hero. For a third time I say, because Hollywood is trite, there was a betrayal. And for the last time, because Hollywood is lazy, the hero is near the brink of death before mustering up the strength to deliver that precious kill shot.Man was this movie a dud. It certainly didn't help to have Vin Diesel as the lead. He makes Keanu Reeves look like a Tony award winner. The Last Witch Hunter really needs to be the last witch hunter. Do not reprise this.",The Last Witch Hunter
11,neil-476,Glossy nonsense,7,23 October 2015,"700-odd years ago, Kaulder (Vin Diesel) leads a party in pursuit of the Witch Queen, bent on retribution for the deaths of his wife and daughter. He is the only survivor. We next find him in present-day Manhattan, cursed with immortality by the Witch Queen, as witch-hunting enforcer for an organisation called Axe And Cross where he is aided and abetted by a chap called the Dolan. The current and 36th Dolan (Michael Caine) is on the point of retiring when he suddenly dies. With the assistance of the 37th Dolan (Elijah Wood) Kaulder starts to chase down some aspects of the death which don't make sense.It was a good idea to take a supernatural movie and put a CSI emphasis on it. It isn't entirely successful here but, mostly, this is a decent romp. Vin Diesel manages to bring together his hardman and his soft side, and makes a protagonist who is fun to identify. Michael Caine plays Alfred again in a ""where's my pay cheque?"" part, which gets the performance it deserves. Rose Leslie - very pretty, and I'd never heard of her having never watched Downton Abbey or Game Of Thrones - does what she can with a part which is chunky in terms of screen time and skeletal in terms of character development.This isn't a terribly good film, but I quite enjoyed it simply because it's the sort of not terribly good film which I quite enjoy.

12,morrison-dylan-fan,The Witcher.,4,6 January 2021,"After watching the incredible Perfect Blue (1997-also reviewed) for my 2,500th review on this site,I decided to relax with a easy-going flick. One of the first flicks to pop up when I checked the Sci-Fi/ Fantasy section on Netflix,I got set to join at the witching hour.View on the film:Directing for the first time since 2010's The Crazies remake, director Breck Eisner & Dead Calm (1989-also reviewed) cinematographer Dean Semler lift the sword for a pulpy Fantasy tale, and completely miss the mark, with a horribly muddy aesthetic, and over reliance on CGI dimming the sparks of playfulness this Fairy Tale Action flick should have been beaming with.Conjured from lead Vin Diesel being a Dungeons and Dragons fan,and having Olafur Darri Olafsson, Elijah Wood and Sir Michael Caine join in to take a roll of the 20-sided dice, the screenplay by Cory Goodman,Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless promisingly open their tale with Kaulder being cursed with eternal life and working for a secret organisation to keep the truce between witches and humans strong.Sadly,the writers turn but the pulpy offerings sour, with long, messy dips into a endless memory spell (flashbacks) and plodding non-twists revealing those standing against the last witch hunter.",The Last Witch Hunter
13,anaconda-40658,Hopefully This is the Last Witch Hunter...Literally.,2,16 December 2015,"The Last Witch Hunter (2015): Dir: Breck Eisner / Cast: Vin Diesel, Elijah Wood, Rose Leslie, Michael Caine, Julie Engelbrecht: Imbecilic science fiction action film that seems to suggest our defence against evil. Vin Diesel plays a cursed witch hunter who is ages in years and now hunts witches in modern day. Elijah Wood plays a young priest who aids Diesel and comes off as unfortunately laughable because he is hardly threatening. His portion of the film is also terribly predictable. Rose Leslie looks stunning in her black leather and flashing red hair but again, her scenes come off as laughable. She works in a bar, likely to intoxicate herself into figuring out how she went from Game of Thrones to this junk. She is a witch but feels outside the box because she is a creature of good yet viewed as a creature of evil because of reputation. Julie Engelbrecht has the good fortune of being under heavy makeup so that she can less associate herself with this junk. She plays a scary witch whom Diesel stabs a half dozen times and plays x's and o's with her body while she burns. Perhaps the worst aspect is how veteran actor Michael Caine got roped into this. He is friends with Diesel before being cursed into a sleep. That is pretty much his role for the remainder of the film. He might as well be asleep for all the good this tripe will do for his overall career. The special effects are okay but director Breck Eisner seems to let everything get away on him just like the swarm of insects that emerge towards the end. This pointless drivel is so pathetically lame that perhaps jamming a stake through it would do it good. Score: 2 / 10",The Last Witch Hunter
14,FlashCallahan,Try that with an iPad......,4,7 November 2015,"The modern world holds many secrets, the most astounding being that witches still live among us. Centuries ago, Kaulder, a man who had no concept of a razor, managed to slay the powerful Witch Queen, supposedly destroying all her followers in the process. Before her death, she cursed the valiant warrior with her own immortality, separating him from his beloved wife and and daughter in the afterlife. Her second coming now threatens the survival of the human race as Kaulder, the only one of his kind remaining, faces her vengeful wrath.......Vin Diesel. You have to feel sorry for the man sometimes. He has great great screen presence, but he is suffering the same problems that actors who played Bond had whilst commanding the role, their side projects suffered and vanished without trace.With Brosnan, we had flops like Dantes Peak, and Grey Owl. And with Craig, films like The Invasion, and The Golden Compass, failed to find an audience.Fast and Furious franchise aside, Diesel hasn't has a hit in over 13 years, despite trying to resurrect Riddick, and Babylon A.D.This is what happens when you settle for a decent Pay check and a guaranteed hit, people start to care less about your standalone movies, and Diesel should know that the F & F franchise isn't successful because of him, it's successful because of the chemistry and the sheer madness of it all.This is a shame because this had so much potential to be a fun popcorn movie, the scene on the pane shows Diesel with plenty of swagger and personality, but then around the twenty minute mark, it's as if his eyes glaze over, gets the crew to stop filming, and then advise the writers to watch the following films.......Blade Warlock Highlander Constantine The MatrixAnd get then to get all the best bits from those movies, and like witches themselves, cast a spell and hope it works.It doesn't. Instead, we have a sense of déjà Vu we get when we see a movie that has ran out of ideas too soon, it always refers back to older, better, more successful movies,hoping that the star power, and the cameo from the seasoned actor will cover the tell tale signs.It doesn't, not one iota of the second and third act deliver anything of interest, apart from spotting blatant rip offs of other movies.You want to see a film where Diesel feels grass like Crowe did in Gladiator? It's here, and it's a shot for shot 'homage' and it's the funniest thing in the film.Wood adds a little bit of comic relief, but his characters quest makes it difficult to warm to him.Effects are okay, but at the end of the day, effects do not make a film, a coherent plot, narrative and structure do, and this film has none.But to be fair, when you first heard about this film, you knew it was going to flop anyway.In really hope they make a sequel with Nicolas Cage and and call it Season Of The Last Witch Hunter.

Rose Leslie plays a winsome witch with mettle while Ólafur Darri Ólafsson is on hand as a formidable evil warlock.I thought I'd like ""The Last Witch Hunter"" (2015) since it mixes ""End of Days"" (1999) with ""Van Helsing"" (2004) and elements of ""Ghost Rider"" (2007) and ""The Mummy"" (1999) but, while Vin Diesel towers in the lead role, the story is meh. The overblown intro with its CGI-laden witch grotto sequence wasn't a good first impression. By the halfway mark I wanted to turn it off, but I persevered.Everything is here for a quality movie of this sort, but the story isn't captivating and doesn't build any drive. It just goes through the motions. The script needed a serious rewrite.

We did had examples enough, Constantine (2005), Van Helsing (2004) were perfect flicks to show that CGI can destroy this type of action flicks. the opening was rather great but once we were thrown to nowadays this flick became mediocre.

Together with lovely Rose Leslie, he saves the world from the bad witches, alone, and still ignorant of the machinations around him. In the end the obvious thing at the beginning of the movie becomes the secret that threatens the world once again.The film is reasonably acted (Vin Diesel is perfect until he tries to smile) and the script is a typical adventure fiction story. In the end you get exactly what you expected, no more, no less. However, a storm of bad publicity that rose out of nothing (magic perhaps? Who put those runes together like that?) made everyone bad mouth it like little parrots.Is this is a good movie? Not really. Is it a blockbuster movie that can entertain. Yes! The thing that one must realize is that even if someone would have wanted to make the effort to make the film better, for art's sake, no matter they would have gotten the same amount of money in the end, there wasn't much they could have done. It's a one hour and a half story in which Vin Diesel destroys witches. What else can you cram in there? Opera? Character development before he kills everybody?They could have gone with more realistic and complex fight scenes, more horror, make it R rated, perhaps. That alone would have easily turned it into a pretty cool movie, but then mothers wouldn't have let their preciouses go to the theaters, those that would chose to even distribute it.Bottom line: just go, turn your brain off and enjoy. At least they didn't murder another book series, like they did with Seventh Son, where they had all the story and characters and fan base from the books and still they messed it up somehow.",The Last Witch Hunter

19,KineticSeoul,It might have worked if it was a video game,4,13 March 2016,"This seemed like a video game movie, although it's not a video game movie. Maybe they tried to borrow elements from the video game ""The Witcher"" and tried to emulate certain aspects from the movie ""Constantine"" 2005. But it just doesn't work as a whole, because it lacked the creativity and composure of the ""Constantine"" movie. When John Constantine actually does stuff to fight off demons, it felt coherent because you know why he is doing those things. Like with the holy water, mirrors, lighter and etc. But in this unless you know a lot about fake witchcraft, it just all seemed so darn random at times. It seemed like they were making magic up as they go, maybe I am wrong and it's certain spells that are in the Dungeons & Dragons player's handbook. Speaking of Dungeons & Dragons I am pretty darn sure Vin Diesel wanted to play a part in this trashy movie because of his Dungeons & Dragons days. Vin apparently has a main character named Melkor who is a witch hunter that he used a lot while playing Dungeons & Dragons. Anyways there really isn't anything got my attention and the whole experience felt soulless. It really did seemed like I was watching someone play a video game. Where you try to go on a investigations dealing with supernatural beings and having boss battles. This formula might have worked in a video game but not in a movie. Overall, this was a dull movie to sit through and it did nothing to make the audiences feel like there was something at stake. The overly serious tone actually made this movie more annoying. Because it seemed like it wasn't sure to go with a gut churning, blood spilling, witch hunting movie or a teen sci-fi movie at times.4/10",The Last Witch Hunter

It was directed by Breck Eisner (who also helmed the 2010 horror flick 'THE CRAZIES', and the 2005 action movie 'SAHARA'); and it was written by Cory Goodman, Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless (Goodman also wrote 2011's 'PRIEST', and Sazama and Sharpless also co-wrote 2014's 'DRACULA UNTOLD'; a lot of religious themed horror flicks!). The movie is a bit slow-paced and messy, but it's also enjoyable (to a certain extent).Kaulder (Diesel) is an ancient warrior, who killed the deadly Witch Queen (Julie Engelbrecht); centuries earlier. When he did so, she also cursed him with immortal life. So now Kaulder must walk the earth; forever fighting witches, and other demons, while also being haunted by the memories of his dead family (that he can never see again, in the afterlife). His latest mission, is to stop a new deadly force; from unleashing a horrible plague on all of humanity. He finds assistance from a young priest (Wood), and a beautiful witch (Leslie) though.The movie establishes a pretty cool fantasy world; of dark magic, and the way in which it's policed. Diesel makes a pretty badass action hero too. Elijah Wood has now became the male equivalent of a 'scream queen' (it seems like he's in more horror flicks than any other actor right now); he's good in the film as well. Caine is of course always fantastic (but he's above this sort of movie), and Leslie is fun to watch too. The directing is just OK though, and the screenplay is pretty sloppy. The film has some cool action scenes, and some pretty fun ideas, but it's kind of a big mess; when it tries to bring them all together.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/41q3ZuWGdEE",The Last Witch Hunter

22,bowmanblue,The generic bad-thing hunter,5,16 August 2016,"'The Last Witch Hunter' is Van Diesel's latest action flick – and it's pretty by-the-numbers. It's one of those films that you can sort of have on in the background and still know exactly what's happening at all times. I'm not saying that it's bad, just that you probably won't remember it and that you've seen it all before – namely in films like Van Helsing, Constantine and I Frankenstein.As with the other films I've just mentioned, you have a secret society (funded by the church in most cases) who employs a single person to despatch whatever evil is threatening humanity. You could pretty much take out 'witches' from the title and replace the baddie with any other movie monster, i.e. werewolves and you've sort of have the same film.Vin Diesel plays himself – a wise-cracking bad-ass that you've seen in almost all his other films. And, if you're a fan, you'll be happy enough with his performance. He goes about his business incarcerating computer generated witches who cast computer generated magic against computer generated backdrops with the help of one sidekick after the next. He sort of starts off with Michael Caine, the goes through Ellija Wood and ends up with Rose Leslie (although Michael Caine's input is little more than just an extended cameo).Sadly, the film's plot is pretty basic with predictable twists and not great dialogue. There are a few good one liners to keep it amusing and not too serious, but a handful of good lines don't really elevate the film enough to make it even into a cult classic.The baddies themselves are equally forgettable. I remember when Terminator 2 was released, they made sure that the evil T-1000 robot frequently morphed back into its initial character. This was to give audiences a recognisable face of the villain. Here the witch does a lot of morphing, but you don't really see her much besides the beginning and the end.I get the feeling the film-makers were hoping to make a franchise out of The Last Witch Hunter. I could sort of see that happening, but, if by some miracle (or black magic?) it did, I think all sequels would be sent straight to DVD. It's not a bad film, just one that you've probably seen before – and better. For Vin Diesel fans only.",The Last Witch Hunter
23,ThomasDrufke,Immortal Vin,6,22 October 2015,"I think it would be hard for people not to admit that Vin Diesel is one of the most likable actors living today. He's not the thespian that a Leonardo DiCaprio or Daniel Day-Lewis is, but the man is entertaining as hell. The Last Witch Hunter is yet another vehicle for Diesel to excel in as a true movie star, no Fast and Furious pun intended. The film is not very good at all, but it's incredibly entertaining.Putting Vin aside, you have a solid cast with Elijah Wood, Rose Leslie, and the cinema legend Michael Caine for gosh sakes. This was most definitely a paycheck film for Caine, but he gave a formidable performance. Leslie, from Game of Thrones fame, also was solid as the dream-walker/semi love interest for Diesel. Elijah Wood has a very limited role and I never really bought into his character or performance rather. The writing is not exactly Oscar worthy, it's rather poor actually. But it didn't need to be. Vin gave us just as many lame one liners as every Fast and Furious film. Plus, it's hilarious hearing Diesel call Caine a 'kid'. It's these gags that added to the outrageously fun experience.The reviews for the film have been poor to say the least, and I can't really argue with them. For me, it was just endlessly entertaining. I actually found the CGI to be quite effective for the most part especially for the villainous witch queen. So the story and writing can be confusing, weak, and contradicting at times, but the visuals and performances make the viewing worth while. There's not much else to say, but I hope this 90 million dollar film turns into a franchise, although I think it's destined to flop.+Perfect film for Diesel+Solid cast+Leslie holds her own+CGI-Weak writing-Contradicting story6.3/10",The Last Witch Hunter

I have to admit that I was not expecting a whole lot from this movie. This usually isn't my kind of movie and I am not a huge Vin Diesel fan. All that said I will say that this wasn't nearly as bad as I was expecting. The dialog was bad but the effects made up for it.

Vin Diesel stars in his usual acting mode, this time in a different role then Don, but acting is the same. Not that it's bad. I was quite entertained watching ""The Last Witch Hunter"" to be honest, i thought it is going to be lot worse, but it had quite nice and involving plot actually, some interesting variations on magic, and some great actors in doing their usually uniformly good job. Special effects were good, but no Oscars will shine in this category. Overall, ""The Last Witch Hunter"" is definitely not bad flick for one evening with some friends and beer. Although it's structure is very familiar and formulaic, at least they tried to input some originality into story itself, which i enjoyed more then i though i would be.

28,The-Sarkologist,An Entertaining Halloween Flick,6,31 October 2015,"Well, I guess I got what I expected when I first saw this movie advertised. Okay, I'm not necessarily going to knock it because it was enjoyable, but I'm certainly not going to go out a rave about it either. I guess this film can really be summed up in one word – entertaining. It is basically one of those films that you go and see once and then don't bother watching it again. Personally, I don't think I could really watch it again. It isn't deep, it isn't thought provoking, it is just a modern Gothic horror with witches, magic, and Vin Diesel doing what Vin Diesel usually does in movies where he is the star (with the exception of Guardians of the Galaxy, but then again he really only had one line in that movies – I am Groot), Anyway, as you can probably guess from the title this movie is about a guy who is a witch hunter but apparently the term 'the last' is a little bit of a misnomer because I noticed that somebody indicated that there were none before him, which means he is the only witch hunter. Then again the title 'The Only Witch Hunter' probably wouldn't go across as well as 'The Last Witch Hunter'. As is typical with such movies the witch hunter, who happens to have the name Kaulder, has all of his family murdered by witches, so he then goes on a rampage against the tree of the witch queen. However just before he kills her she curses him with immortality (is that really a curse?).Well, the stage is set for some tough guy running around the modern world killing all sorts of nasty creatures and their minion, however it pretty quickly becomes evident that this is not the case. We jump forward to the 21st century were he is sitting on a plane and discovers that there is a witch on board. Well, I have to admit that I was half expecting him to pull out this massive sword (which would have made me ask the question – how did he get THAT on the plane) when he doesn't. It turns out that not all witches are bad and the ones that he is hunting are the ones that use magic to harm humans.Yes, as it turns out witches aren't actually human because they have magic in them. The thing with witches is that they don't particularly like humans because humans have this nasty habit of destroying nature, which happens to be the source of their power. As such there has been this rather brutal war between the witches and the humans (and the black plague happened to be a product of this war). However they have since made a truce and while they don't necessarily live in peace together, they tolerate each other's existence. Of course there are a bunch who really don't like this truce and consider those witches who honour the treaty to be little more than traitors.Anyway, I think I have said enough about this film. Basically it is what I would call a 'Halloween film' because it is about witches, though I would hardly call it a horror film, but then again my definition of horror generally doesn't involve nasty monsters and action heroes. It's entertaining but that's about it.",The Last Witch Hunter

30,Reno-Rangan,Fighting the same witch twice in the 800 years!,5,24 August 2016,"I have seen Vin Diesel in many avatars, from the sci-fi to action, adventure and thriller, they all suits him better, but this supernatural theme seems weird. There was lots of action, so it does not feel like a fantasy film, which is merely the idea of film concept. From the director of 'Sahara', the story of an cursed with eternal life witch hunter named Kaulder. Except the opening, the remaining film sets in the present New York city where he has to stop a witch who is trying to bring back the witch queen from the dead.It was just another those films where the ancient meets the modern world. Okay, I agree a few films did impacted from the last two decades since the evolution of the CGI. Even though, they were not considered the greatest, in the meantime, I don't know where did this one come from. It was not based on any book, but I think just to make a few quick bucks using the star power. Other than that this film offers nothing new.Yes, I liked the Diesel's presence in this, but he should not do films like this, except if the screenplay and role developed to his caliber. It was not a big box office hit, but merely survived and critically didn't. Even the film fanatics and fans of the star disappointed with it. Now I can't believe the sequel is announced, but I hope it won't take off. Anyway, it could become a decent television series rather than a film franchise.Diesel is the reason for this film to look okay and the story was maybe the hundredth time used. Come on we all know this story, but with a new cast and the settings, it looks different. So for me the film was an average, other than that, I don't think it is worth recommending to the others. If you still want to see it, then pick the digital 3D version where you can at least enjoy some special effects.5/10",The Last Witch Hunter
31,paulclaassen,"No fireworks, but an ok watch.",5,12 June 2019,"There's been so many witch movies recently - some good, some terrible. This film is neither, although it certainly is better than it is bad. Firstly, I don't believe Vin Diesel was a wise choice as the protagonist. He looks and sounds the same in every film, he might as well have been Dominic Toretto without fast cars... I also didn't find Rose Leslie a strong enough actress to portray Chloe.Regarding the visual effects, wow, they really do have A LOT of effects in this film. Some of the effects reminded me of 1999's 'The Mummy', and a bit of 'Highlander', too. Towards the end it really became CGI-heavy.The film became confusing jumping forward and backward in time through dreams and memories. The plot was incoherent and a lot happened for effect only. The story seems to invent magic for the characters to use as the plot requires them. It felt way too convenient and not believable.

The film is quite derailing and predictable, as well as not nearly as entertaining as one should be. Many have seemed to question why Vin Diesel decided to star in this film, especially considering he must have received many film offers, which he turned down. One can assumed he thought the film would start another franchise for him, however, a year later since it's release, The Last Hunter has been somewhat forgotten, and a massive step back for Vin Diesel's career. The film was not only a box office disaster, but it received poor reviews from critics. As a rewatch 05/03/21' opinions remain same. This film is quite dull and boring.

33,eddie_baggins,"More enjoyable than it should be, this is passable trashy entertainment",5,10 February 2016,"Far more fun than it really has any right to be, this newest Vin Diesel wannabe franchise starter (is it in his contract to demand potential sequels?) is a movie that does exactly as its title would suggest and while it's got about as many memorable scenes as Vin Diesel's acting ranges (eg; not many), The Last Witch Hunter's runtime wizzes by and there are enough decent ideas thrown around the mix here that perhaps a franchise isn't exactly the worst thing that could happen next once the credits roll.Directed by Sahara and The Crazies helmer Breck Eisner, Witch Hunter wastes little time in throwing the audience into a modern day world in which witches and similar nasties inhabit our everyday lives without interrupting us mere mortals, as conveniently described to us the viewer by a now to be expected Michael Caine narration, whose been using his old blighter accent well when explaining important facets of information or recounting Dylan Thomas poems in recent years.It's clear Eisner and his action oriented star in the form of Diesel were keen to not delve too deep into this story which when examined closely is all types of silly. From church orders of secret witch hunting guardians, gummi bear trees and witch only nightclubs, Witch Hunter has a pretty wild world at its disposal and it's a good thing it never tries too hard to play itself overly serious as if it did, it's likely the audience would've failed to give it any type of benefit of the doubt treatment.Where The Witch Hunter finds itself at its best is between a somewhat miscast Diesel (who struggles with the films more sombre moments) and side characters like Rose Leslie's dreamwalker Chloe or Elijah Wood's witch hating priest Dolan 37th and some of the stories more bizarre almost 80's like concepts make it feel like a film cut from another time period entirely. Where The Witch Hunter finds itself treading water, is in a sub-standard plot that closes out in a highly tame finale, some crudely constructed dialogue and some unimaginative action scenes that seem ripped straight from a video game.Big, dumb and brain numbingly fun, if you don't expect anything more than some forgettable yet bearable movie making silliness then The Last Witch Hunter will prove the perfect companion to a lazy night on the couch and with glimpses of even more potential, there might just be those that find themselves looking forward to a possible sequel, no doubt none more so than Vin Diesel himself.2 ½ Gummi Bear trees out of 5",The Last Witch Hunter
34,filipemanuelneto,"An action and adventure film which is not surprising, despite being able to entertain.",5,3 May 2020,"I approached this film with caution and low expectations. However, I ended up concluding that it's not as bad as I thought it could be. In fact, despite being far from brilliant, its a very decent action and adventure film that will entertain us quite well, if we dont give excessive relevance to the problems that arise.Everything is centred on a man who cannot die, the result of a curse he was the victim of in the Middle Ages, when he set fire to the sacred tree of the queen of witches and tried to kill her. He has lived an unusually long human life in the service of the Catholic Church, and has been busy chasing witches and magicians who violate magical laws (does it sound enough like Harry Potter?).The film stars Vin Diesel, a muscular veteran of action films, who already knows what he has to do and does it without any problems. He is not even close to my favorite actor and sometimes he has the dramatic expressiveness of an apple (I am being nice), but he is not one of the worst around. In this film, he even does a satisfying job. Next to him is an impeccable Michael Caine, making extensive use of traditional British impassivity, a good Rose Leslie, an imposing Olafur Darri Olafsson and even Julie Engelbrecht, who does what she really has to do. We can still see Elijah Wood, who looks surprisingly well in a cassock but does not seem to know how he ended up in this film, disappearing quickly. Did he make a mistake in the studio?As expected, the film has a lot of regular CGI but does not bring anything truly spectacular. The action scenes are also good but relatively mild. Of course, everything seems false, of course the film does not have a hint of credibility, but if the audience only wants to entertain their spare time, I think that is enough. The sets, costumes, cinematography and soundtrack are also not particularly worth mentioning.",The Last Witch Hunter
35,leonblackwood,Average supernatural movie! 5/10,5,13 March 2016,"Review: For some unknown reason, I wasn't a big fan of this movie. Vin Diesel (Kaulder) seemed like he was concentrating on looking cool, more than looking for witches and Rose Leslie (Chloe), seemed a bit out of place. The storyline was straight forward! Basically, Kaulder is an ancient Witch Hunter, who is given a curse from an evil Witch, while he is killing her, with eternal life. Through his 800 years on earth, he fights against various witches with his trusty companion Dolan 36th (Michael Caine), but when Dolan mysteriously gets murdered, Kaulder opens a world which leads back to the evil Witch Queen (Julie Engelbrecht), who was kept alive. To get the various potions that he needs to open his mind, he goes to Chloe for her help, who is also a witch, and they soon realise that Dolan 36th isn't actually dead and that he can be saved if they can release the curse in time. After battling against the witches soldiers, Kaulder and Chloe finally come face to face with the evil Witch Queen and they battle to kill her before she puts a plague on earth. Not the best of story lines but it was watchable. I loved the chemistry between Caine and Diesel but apart from that, there isn't any memorable moments that I got from the film. Diesel seemed a bit stiff and I didn't really find him convincing, especially as he's supposed to be an 800 year old warrior/Witch Hunter. You also don't get to see the attention to detail, because of the Dark theme of the film and the Witch just looked like a human in a suit. Elijah Woods character, Dolan 37th, was a bit pointless and the epic fight scene at the end was an weak anti-climax. Anyway, it's a watchable movie which is quite entertaining in parts but it's not in the amazing category. Watchable!Round-Up: Vin Diesel, 48, is the perfect choice for movies like the Fast & Furious franchise, XxX and Riddick, even though I wasn't impressed with the latest Riddick but apart from that, his movies haven't been that great. The Pacifier was awful and A Man Apart, Knockaround Guys and Boiler Room were quickly forgotten but he has a unique screen appeal which has made the Fast & Furious franchise a massive hit. Judging by the ending of this movie and the various rumours, there is definitely going to be a sequel to this film and with other Fast and Furious projects in the pipeline, plus a rumoured Kojak movie, it seems like the best is yet to come. Although he is highly respected in Hollywood, it doesn't seem like his fresh projects have been blowing up in the box office but his movies always make a profit, which is always a plus for an actor who first came on the scene in Strays in 1997 and Saving Private Ryan in 1998. Anyway, this movie was directed by Breck Eisner, 45, who brought you Thoughtcrimes in 2003, Sahara with Matthew McConaghey in 2005 and The Crazies in 2010. He hasn't got loads of experience behind the camera but Vin Diesel did produce the movie so he had some help from an experienced producer. Personally, I think they have to come up with a whole different concept for the sequel because the theme that has been set, will soon run dry.Budget: $90million Worldwide Gross: $140.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/adventure/fantasies starring Vin Diesel, Michael Caine.

36,TheMovieDiorama,The Last Witch Hunter offers a plague of fantastical visual effects yet eternally damns all to boredom.,4,23 April 2019,"If you told me that Vin Diesel would be cast as a witch slayer who is cursed with eternal life, I would've joked that his other 'Fast & Furious' family member Dwayne Johnson was cast as a CGI scorpion monstrosity. Oh, wait a minute...! Anyway, back to the witch hunt, fantasy adventures are my bread and butter with a light spreading of fantastical flavoursome jam. But only when the adventure is thrilling, characters are infectiously entertaining and the medium of film is put to maximum usage. This disposable start to a forced franchise succumbs to the symptom that most modern fantasy flicks contain. Emptiness. We see a witch hunter, the last apparently (who knew!), tasked in saving the world from the Witch Queen who has recently been resurrected.Incoming special effects, visualised environments and Diesel's deep mumbling voice. The first two factors are well executed, with many creatures and dream-like worlds looking surprisingly realistic exhuming that magical quality. The world building is thick with much of the dialogue cementing the foundations of the lore. Order of the Axe and Cross, Dolans and the Witch Council. This inevitably leaves no room for, yes you guessed it, character development.Kaulder is emotionless thanks to Diesel's terrible miscasting. His niche charm just does not work for this genre, in my opinion. He is accompanied by a witch named Chloe, performed by Leslie who singlehandedly uses her wit and comedic execution to save the film, who conveniently has a ridiculous amount of spells and abilities to save Kaulder whenever he is in peril such as dream-walking. Essentially negating any thrills. Caine is quickly replaced by Wood as the friendly neighbourhood priest who only exists for a specific plot point in the third act, which was abhorrently unnecessary.Suffice to say I wanted this to be good.

39,Vartiainen,I really wanted to like this...,4,21 July 2020,"I have to be honest. I was pulling for this film. It has Vin Diesel as the main character. It is urban fantasy. It has Catholic symbolism. Its CGI is surprisingly good. It has Vikings in it. What's not to love?And to be fair, the first half of this film is pretty much what I was hoping for. Vin Diesel plays Kaulder, a man cursed with immortality who has spent the centuries of his life hunting witches and sorcerers who would misuse the gift of magic. But now his original woe, The Witch Queen who cursed him to live forever, is returning. So he has to team up with his latest cleric helper as well as a young witch bearing an ancient magical gift in order to beat this adversary.We get a lot of really cool magical spells being cast. We get a lot of religious symbolism. We get one mean warlock named Baltasar Ketola (Ólafur Darri Ólafsson) hunting Kaulder - easily the best character in the film aside from Kaulder himself.But then comes the second half. Baltasar is quickly tossed aside when Julie Engelbrecht's Witch Queen becomes more prominent and she just isn't as interesting as Baltasar. Part of that is the heavy CGI makeup but part of that is sheer charisma missing from her performance.Beyond that there's also the problem of predictability. We joked around when the first few introductory scenes were playing out, predicting what would happen to certain characters if this was a bad B-list horror fantasy film. Then we forgot those jokes when the first half of the film managed to pull us in.Every single one of those jokes came true...The Last Witch Hunter has a good premise. It has bones. I can see why Vin Diesel is interested in making a sequel. But man, was the second half of this film rough. Disappointing doesn't even begin to describe it.",The Last Witch Hunter
40,subxerogravity,It could have been so much better if Vin was not trying to find another franchise.,6,23 October 2015,"2013 was a good year for Vin Diesel, with the summer release of furious 6, that made around a billion. Than in the fall he released the third installment of Riddick, entitled Riddick. I know it did not bring in billions like Furious 6, but it was a boss Rated R Sci-fi film. So, in 2015 after the release of Furious 7 being another billion dollar block buster, I was expecting the Last Which Hunter to be like Riddick.I should never get my hopes up. The movie had potential, but it looks to me that they watered down what could have been another dark serious film for Vin in order to see if they can built another Franchise (when your first franchise is worth billions, why do you need another?)If you ""really"" like Vin that much, than you'll love this movie. He's a little more Xander cage from XXX than he is Riddick however, playing a not-so-nice guy, that nobody should like but you grow to respect because of his bad ass principals.Vin is a 800 year old warrior cursed by a witch with immortality and now vows to spend his forever hunting them. Sounds cool, right?I was also expecting more because Elijah Wood was in it. He's been involved in some pretty cool horror movies lately and I assumed he selected this role because it was going in the darker direction, but this movie does not even have some of the scary that the Rings had. The few action sequences this film has are mediocre. they start strong and end week. It's mostly just Vin walking around New York for 90mins, which is as interesting as it sounds.Plus, I felt like I was watching a superhero movie the way they disrespected the villains, who were barely villains. They tired to make them look cool, but I can't remember the last time I saw, what are suppose to be major characters, so one dimensional. It was like they were saying, ""no one cares who the villains are. Look, Vin Diesel"".Give the movie some credit for it's well done visual effects when it came to the magic, and a humorous performance by Micheal Kane who plays a watered down version of Alfred from the Dark Knight Trilogy.It's Alright.

Story wise it is pretty flimsy but this is a special effects heavy movie, and they're are quite good, even though I am not a big lover of CGI.

43,stevendbeard,Good CGI But Confusing Storyline,6,23 October 2015,"I saw ""The Last Witch Hunter"", starring Vin Diesel-the Fast & Furious movies, the Riddick movies; Michael Caine-Interstellar, Miss Congeniality; Rose Leslie-Downtown Abbey_tv, Game of Thrones_tv and Elijah Wood-Sin City, the Lord of the Rings movies.This is a new one for Vin Diesel fans. He plays a 14th century witch hunter named Kaulder that gets cursed by his latest kill, to become an immortal. It seems that the dying witch wants Vin to outlive his beloved family and be miserable for the rest of his life. Flash forward some 800 years later, to our present, and Vin is still hunting witches, but now he has a Catholic priest as a sidekick. These sidekicks are routinely replaced over the years-retired, quit, or killed in the line of duty- since Vin is immortal and outlives them but for some reason, they are all named Dolan. Michael is Vin's latest Dolan and he is about to retire when something bad happens to him. Elijah is the next Dolan to assist Vin and their first job is to find out who messed with their friend, Michael. In the present world, there are good witches and bad witches. Vin is only interested in ridding the world of the bad ones. Rose plays one of the good ones that helps Vin in his crusade. There is a lot of good CGI but sometimes, the story was a little confusing. I heard that this is supposed to be the first in a new franchise for Vin so we will have to wait until the box office speaks, but if they do make more, I hope they get a little better and less confusing. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence and frightening images and has a running time of 1 hour & 46 minutes. I don't know if I would buy this one on DVD but it would be a good rental.",The Last Witch Hunter
44,JoeB131,Starring Vin Diesel as Vin Diesel,4,6 July 2020,"And that's what you need to know, Vin Diesel, a bunch of CGI special effects. Okay action set pieces and a good supporting cast including Michael Caine and Elijah Wood.Vin plays a medival warrior who is out to kill the witch queen who killed his family, but in turn is made immortal by the queen as a curse. He becomes the center of a religious order focused on keeping the peace between witches and normal humans. Hardly an original premise... Hellboy, Men in Black, etc. come to mind.Well, give Vin his props, he's a likeable actor. But nothing about this movie is memorable....Some parts were downright predictable. Was anyone surprised when Frodo Baggins turned out to be the traitor? I wasn't. I'll probably forget I saw it in a month.",The Last Witch Hunter

46,lukem-52760,AN UNDERRATED BUT FANTASTIC FANTASY THRILLER,8,24 April 2020,"I had to admit after watching this extremely underrated but excellent film that it's become my favourite Vin Diesel movie. I always liked the beefed-up & tough Vin Diesel from way back watching the Cult Classic Sci-fi Horror, Pitch Black at the cinema & from then i liked him in the Ensemble Gangster Drama, Knockaround Guys & he was good in the first XXX flick & excellent in the old school style Revenge Cop Thriller, A Man Apart & the Awesome Chronicles of Riddick but i never liked the silly Fast & Furious franchise & his Apocalyptic sci-fi Thriller, Babylon A.D was pretty good & Riddick was Awesome too & of course this fantasy Horror Thriller, The Last Witch Hunter i loved.I don't know why the boring critics hated this? Yet they will like the latest crap ""Tom Cult Cruise"" film (I hate that guy) so it comes down to what you like yourself & i never follow anyone as i like what i like & that's it.Here the action legend Vin Diesel is really good as an immortal professional Witch Hunter that works for the Church & hunts down ,only the Evil witches & there's just as many good ones living among us. This film is set in present day New York City & it's captured beautifully with the cinematography, especially the night time scenes & the look of the witches hideouts that look like parts of a beautiful enchanting Forrest, are stunning, the look, sets & production design is outstanding in this movie, it's a visual treat. Diesel plays Kaulder & he's lived for so long & has seen all the atrocities of the world throughout his years as he was cursed by an Evil Witch centuries ago & has lost his wife & daughter to the evil ones. Diesel gives a solid & serious action hero performance as the tough immortal warrior that all witches fear abit like the Blade character in a way & he's good as our hero to follow on his witch hunt in this fantasy world full of black Magic.
The supporting cast is good too with the ageing legend Michael Caine & Elijah Wood & a really good performance from Rose Leslie as a good witch named Chloe, who helps our hero in his battle against evil.
As i said the production design for this film is spectacular & obviously had a huge budget splashed over this & it's got a slick look & a decent music score too. The main Evil Queen Witch is a scary design & is actually frightening & makes for a very dangerous villain for Diesel to battle.
The beginning sequence is incredible, exciting & creepy as Diesel with a gang of Viking warriors enter a huge ancient Tree type Witch nest that is a hidden coven for demonic witches that are scary as hell & reminded me of the possessed demons in the Evil Dead remake.
Good atmosphere & mix of Horror & fantasy.This is a fun big budget blockbuster popcorn movie & it's a good time but it's also a well made & richly detailed fantasy action Thriller.
I really enjoyed it & it's an underrated Gem & one i will watch again & again",The Last Witch Hunter
47,Pairic,Good Fantasy/Horror. 8/10.,8,10 May 2018,"The Last Witch Hunter: I like the idea of Michael Caine as a priest who is a handler for an assassin. Vin Diesel is no albino monk though he has more lines than usual. Diesel is the Witch Hunter, cursed by a Witch Queen he killed to live for eternity. Hes lasted 800 years so far and Caine is his 36th Dolan: chronicler/handler/confessor who works for a secret RCC Order.

48,3xHCCH,Average Unoriginal Witch Film,5,22 October 2015,"In ancient times, Kaulder was a fearless witch hunter who was able to kill the Queen Witch herself. However, before she died, the Queen cursed Kaulder with immortality. Cut to modern times, Kaulder is the last witch hunter of his kind. A congregation of priests called the Axe and Cross were commissioned to help Kaulder over the centuries in his sworn mission to incapacitate and incarcerate all the bad witches. Loyalists of the Queen though are working feverishly to resurrect her, setting up a major confrontation between good and evil to decide the fate of mankind.As predicted, Vin Diesel's acting was as one-dimensional as ever. His look was as unchanging as ever too. He looks the same whoever character he played -- Riddick, Toretto, now Kaulder. They should have kept the ancient Kaulder look which would have set the character apart. As predicted also, Vin Diesel's pervasive good guy vibes are very apparent no matter how tough or violent he gets. These good vibes saved the day, making this derivative and CG-laden witch adventure more bearable and entertaining. Of course, we would root for him to route the queen and her minions, good should triumph over evil!Michael Caine and Elijah Wood play priests of the Axe and Cross, who were Kaulder's personal assistants, advisers and bodyguards, Dolan 36th and Dolan 37th respectively. However, their roles were not as big as their names would make you expect. Caine was as cool as you'd expect, acting like he was Alfred or any of the recent Caine roles you can recall. His performance was always a respectable effort even though he may only be just phoning this one in, being so short. Elijah Wood looked very wrong in this role. The way he looked with a priest's collar was very awkward. His acting was so stiff, as if he knew how wrong he was for that role.I was expecting the priests to be Kaulder's sidekicks in his battle against the Witch Queen, but it turns out they would be out of the scene for most parts of the film. Kaulder's companion would be a young female witch named Chloe played by Rose Leslie. Leslie, who gained popularity as Wildling Ygritte in TV's ""Game of Thrones,"" is a polarizing actress, either you will like her or you won't. I like her, so I liked that she has moved onto Hollywood, and she gives a strong feisty performance as her TV character did.I did not think this film ""The Last Witch Hunter"" would be anything original, and it was not. The poster was generic, looking like it could be a poster of one of Vin Diesel's ""Riddick"" films. Even the title was generic, ""Witch Hunter"" having been just used in a recent Jeremy Renner- Gemma Arterton film called ""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters."" Still I went in to watch this film because it is a Vin Diesel film. As consistently one-note his tough guy roles were, at least Diesel certainly knew how to entertain his audience. And that he did. 5/10.",The Last Witch Hunter
49,peterp-450-298716,"A boring, uninspired fantasy attempt.",3,9 March 2016,"""Today we both die. I curse you with life. To never know peace. To walk the Earth alone for eternity. You will never die.""Isn't it fun when some old-fashioned witch hunting is being used in a typical action-fantasy film. The last time I saw a duo at work who wanted to nip this venom in the bud, was in ""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters"". The latter was a mediocre film, with the proportionally balanced curves of Gemma Arterton raising more enthusiasm than the film itself. In ""The Last Witch Hunter"" such a person isn't included, but in return Vin Diesel was willing to appear. And that's a guarantee for bloated body parts. In this case the muscles of this walking wardrobe.The film needs to warm up just like a real diesel. Once this is done, it switches into a higher gear. Although I think it shifted into high gear, because it threatens to derail once and a while. The intro shows a group of medieval bearded men, armed with grotesque, primitive weapons. One of them is Kaulder (Vin Diesel) who lost his family because of the plague. These warriors plan to eliminate the Witch Queen who summoned this curse. Kaulder succeeds. But before the Witch Queen dies, she curses Kaulder to an eternal life. Flash forward to today's society. We see Kaulder furiously (yep) driving a flashy sports car and living in an expensive penthouse where he enjoys his passion for beautiful women. In between he still tries to get rid of witches. What follows is a fairly fuzzy story about a conspiracy to bring the witch queen back to life. Kaulder tries to prevent this from happening with the cooperation of the not so evil witch Chloe (Rose Leslie). The witch hunter is also assisted by a person of a medieval organization called the Axe and Cross, an ancient brotherhood of priests. The assistant is a priest called Dolan (Michael Caine). When this counsel is apparently murdered, his successor jumps in to help (Elijah Wood). Yep, you can say it's a chaotic story.My opinion about this average movie is short and concise. The best thing this film has to offer, are the sometimes dazzling special effects. And that's about it, because the rest is really too sad for words. Uninspired acting (except that of Rose Leslie who took care of some humor) with a dead boring, emotionless Vin Diesel and overly geeky Elijah Wood whose white turtleneck irritated me throughout the film. That night I had more nightmares about this horrible clothing than about those nasty looking witches. ""The last Witch Hunter"" isn't really exciting so to speak and sometimes it comes across as implausible. Diesel's jugglery with some ancient rune stones aboard an airliner, to control a storm, is such an example. Pretty laughable. All in all I rather see Vin appearing in a movie like ""xXx"", so he can flex his muscles again while producing that primitive growling of his. Apparently there's a sequel in the making. I'll probably let that one magically go past me.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",The Last Witch Hunter

51,Seraphion,Failed to live up to the hype,6,3 November 2015,"800 years ago Kaulder killed the witch queen, but she cursed him with enhanced self healing, which in turn spelled immortality. Now he is the weapon of The Axe and Cross, a secret church order dedicated in monitoring witches who live in secret among humans. On a plane to NYC, he intercepts a witch who carelessly jammed powerful weather runes into her bag, causing massive storms. For centuries a priest titled Dolan has been Kaulder's servant. Now the 36th Dolan is going to retire, and he leaves Kaulder to his successor the 37th. After the new Dolan's initiation ceremony, Kaulder and him go to the old Dolan's place. Out of habit Kaulder senses for magic, which he finds none. But after noticing strange bugs in the room with closed window, Kaulder finds hidden magic and a herb that mediated it. They go to see a warlock Max, who informs them of the herb's buyer's faint description. Kaulder easily finds the place and arrests the person, Alec, with possession of old Dolan's pen. Kaulder and the new Dolan bring Alec to the with council, which then quickly incarcerated him. Kaulder argues that there's still a mastermind behind Ellic but the council disagrees, until he finds another of the strange bug on one of them. He goes to the old Dolan's body and finds that he's actually not dead yet but cursed to look like dead. The only way to break the curse is to kill the caster, Belial, whom Ellic was working for. He also finds clues old Dolan left him, instructing him to remember his own death years ago. Kaulder visits Chloe's witch bar to get a memory potion for it, but Belial interrupts the memory and torched the bar down. Chloe brings Kaulder to Miranda's for her memory potion's supplies, but Belial proceeds them and killed Miranda. They go to Danique's for the memory but she traps him in a hallucination. Chloe reached into it and pulls him out. Thus Kaulder find out that Chloe is a dream-walker. She then helps him remember the death memory. It turns out that the queen's heart, the one thing ensuring her survival, wasn't destroyed. The first Dolan instead kept it as it was linked to Kaulder's life. Kaulder then confronts the new Dolan about it and realizes that Belial is trying to revive the queen. He confronts him and manages to kill him, but the queen's already revived. Kaulder then gets his arsenal and with Chloe he goes to the witch prison. The queen has hypnotized the prisoners into chant a spell supporting her. Kaulder breaks Ellic out of his cell to break the chant chain link and Chloe delves into his mind as Kaulder divert the prison sentinel. Chloe succeeds in stopping the chant and Kaulder confronts the queen. He gets cornered but regains upper hand as he turns on his sword's flames. But the new Dolan stops Kaulder, revealing himself as a mole. The queen hypnotizes Chloe to the chant and kills the new Dolan. Kaulder slips into a dream but his wife and daughter's spirits wake him up and he triumphs over the queen. Kaulder is about to kill the queen's heart as Chloe stops him, saying that there are other monsters beside the queen. Kaulder decides to keep fighting and the old Dolan decides to keep serving him.The story isn't really that interesting since there's already a bunch of movies and TV shows with the same witch theme. This creates a big challenge for this movie to grab audience attention. Thus it seems, this movie rather failed to cope with this challenge. The story seems just to be just a standard tale, trapped on behind the shadows of old franchises similar to this like Harry Potter and Charmed. Yet this movie also tried to incorporate the more adventurous sides of witch hunt movies like Hansel and Gretel or Season of the Witch.I got to say that the movie put adequate weight on the horror side. Those flashbacks and hallucinations scenes sure did a good job in supplanting the story with nice story emphasis and pace regulating. But the equally heavy action side this movie feels like it got stretched so much. All those flaming swords and Kaulder gets thrown around and impaled really pulled back the focus from the more intriguing horror side. The movie's twists and turns feels quite nice, yet they failed to give enough surprise due to various reasons. The whole queen's immortality trickery has been used similarly in many movies that it barely surprised me. The thing with the new Dolan is also really a see-through thing due to cast selection. Oe would really prefer Michael Caine as a servant, for his experience as Alfred for three times, rather than the mediocre job Frodo did with the ring, LOL. But for me it's quite strange that the movie should end that way it did.The acting in overall is really a weird dose for me. It's utterly strange to see Vin Diesel not creating a new persona for this franchise starter role. To me Kaulder looked like how Dom Torreto would be on a Harry Potter movie. We all know Vin can really create a more distinct character persona, like what he did for Riddick. Rose Leslie nicely balanced the story. Her characteristics played well enough for her role. Michael Caine also did well in balancing Kaulder's character, although he only had less screen time here. Elijah Wood did just enough in portraying the curious and eager character of his role, just enough to create diversion from its eventual twist.My say for The Last Witch Hunter (2015) is a score of a mere 6 out of 10. A recommendation would have come from me if I publish this review back when this movie first released. But now there's more interesting picks in the cinemas instead.",The Last Witch Hunter
52,justin-fencsak,Underrated Vin Diesel movie worthy of a digital rental,6,28 July 2019,"When this movie came out in the fall of 2015, it did good business despite getting wrecked by critics. Most recently this film has gained a cult following due to heavy rotation on tv and a discount price for rental on Google Play. Starring Vin Diesel as the main character who fights witches, along with supporting roles form Rose Leslie and Anthony Hopkins as he nears retirement soon after the Transformers misfire. The sound mix is good and the effects are well done. The ending leaves it open for a sequel, which didn't happen due to the lackluster box office of the film.",The Last Witch Hunter
53,moviexclusive,"Vin Diesel brings his trademark attitude, poise and pizazz to the titular role of a franchise starter that is good enough for an entertaining diversion but nothing much more",6,17 October 2015,"Every studio wants a franchise with just about the hottest star in Hollywood right now, which explains why Sony is re-starting their 'xXx' series and Summit is spending close to $100 million on this modern- day fantasy actioner. Besides starring as the titular witch hunter Kaulder, Vin Diesel is also producing the movie through his One Race Films banner, which imagines the chrome-domed action star as a 14th century grieving father who through hunting the queen witch responsible for the plague upon his village is gifted (or cursed) with immortality and is therefore able to live through the centuries to present-day New York.As narrative convention would have it, Kaulder will do battle yet again with the Queen Witch (Julie Engelbrecht) at the final showdown, which also means the rest of the movie is pretty much about how she comes back to life. By a script from Cory Goodman, Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, that resurrection begins with the ""death"" of Kaulder's friend and handler Dolan the 36th (Michael Caine) on the very night he hands over responsibility to the 37th Dolan (Elijah Wood), which leads him on a pursuit of a powerful witch named Belial (Ólafur Darri Ólafsson) who had placed the senior Dolan under a dark magic spell and a race against time to not only save Father Dolan but also stop Belial from bringing back to life Kaulder's accursed foe from whose apparent death he gained life forever.Along the way, we are acquainted with the secret brotherhood known as the 'Axe and Cross' whom Kaulder does the dirty work of apprehending wayward witches for, as well as the fact that witches are not all bad, especially one with the power to enter people's dreams (known as a 'dream walker') named Chloe (Rose Leslie) whom Kaulder will team up with eventually to defeat the Queen Witch. Except for a final plot twist that feels less organic than obligatory, most of the movie pretty much unfolds without any surprises, whether how Kaulder is in fact a key element for the Queen Witch's return or how the former will be stripped of his immortality just before the climactic fight just to set the stakes higher.Like most fantasy adventures, this one starts off intriguing before falling back to more pedestrian territory, notwithstanding its modern-day setting which uses Pittsburgh as a stand-in for the dark grimy alleys of New York City. Yes, as interesting as the passing of the baton from one Dolan to another or the Axe and Cross brotherhood may sound, both could do with a lot more texture in order to make them integral to the central narrative; as it stands, both are no more than curious sideshows that are somewhat forgotten once Kaulder starts chasing Belial's tail, or for that matter once Kaulder's quest gets not quite so lonely with Chloe tagging along for sport.On his part, director Breck Eisner keeps the proceedings fairly brisk to distract his audience from the shortcomings of Goodman's script, orchestrating one CGI-heavy setpiece after another to sustain what magic he has going in the first place. Few however are outstanding in and of themselves – the fact that most take place against dimly lit locations as is de rigueur for the genre doesn't help, especially since d.p. Dean Semler has a penchant for moving his cameras as the action unfolds – such that the one which makes an impression is in fact the most brightly lit sequence of all set in a bar which Chloe owns that Kaulder visits in order to ""remember (his) death"", according to a cryptic clue which Father Dolan leaves behind just before he is ambushed. Yet, if there is one thing that Eisner does get right, it is not to take the shenanigans too seriously. There is a more than a hint of cheese in the whole modern-day sorcery premise, but Eisner overcomes that with occasional doses of wry self-aware humour. Despite being centuries old, there is a nice irony in how Kaulder persuades Father Dolan to switch his leather-bound notebook for an iPad. Though they share only a couple of scenes together, Diesel and Caine share a warm rapport that is arguably more enjoyable than his interactions with Chloe. Kaulder's scenes with the younger Dolan are also amusing in their own way, especially in how the former schools the latter on the tools and tricks of the witch-hunting trade.But of course, front and centre in each and every one of the scenes is the 48-year-old Diesel, who is coming off a new career high with the runaway success of the recent 'Fast and Furious' movies. Diesel's charisma here is unquestionable, and he brings attitude, poise and pizazz to a role that demands each of these characteristics. As a potential start to a franchise, 'The Last Witch Hunter' is entertaining enough without being groundbreaking or spectacular on its own; and yet insofar as it is meant to be a franchise vehicle for Diesel, it has at least succeeded by creating an appealing character built on the actor's brawns and charm – which, for his fans, is likely to be more than enough.",The Last Witch Hunter
54,quincytheodore,"The Last Witch Hunter casts many mismatched fantasy gimmicks like a desperate magician, lacking identity and any real magic.",5,23 October 2015,"Say what you will about Vin Diesel, the guy has performed a variety of roles. From the famous furious action series, sci-fi, family comedy and even the lesser known crime drama, he's a legitimate blockbuster draw. However, in his recent fantasy escapade, he's bogged down by the same flaws from Constantine and even Van Helsing; far too much stylish fireworks and lacking any real focus on narrative.The Last Witch Hunter tells the story of Kaulder, an immortal who hunts witches for centuries. Straight from the first act, the movie tries to jam as many expositions as possible while panning through myriad of hidden exotic locations practically every five minutes. It feels like a rushed tour of New York and none of CGI view made lasting impression.This is a missed opportunity since the occult version of modern city is teeming with potential. Other movies, even comic books and video games have used this premise to captivate audience effectively. The screenplay could've showcased the mythology with calm pace and imaginative scenery, yet the movie abruptly shifts between uninspiring random clubs, which makes the entire environment seems generic.It doesn't have to be Hellboy 2 level of sophistication, but the lore available feels terribly underutilized. Visual is mostly crafted with CG, and the action is mediocre with crude choreography. Underneath the cosmetic spells, the production value feels simply average, far too similar to Constantine from last decade.This rushed pace is also translated to the characters, which appear like random strangers meshed together and suddenly given strange development. This is not on Vin Diesel alone, the movie has good acting prowess with Elijah Wood and Michael Caine, among others, however the characters are nothing more than stereotypical eccentric magicians or familiar villain. At some points it even looks like some cop procedural series with awkward buddy gimmick.Lastly, Vin Diesel himself isn't that convincing even though he's groomed for superhero epic. In fact, he fared much better as Riddick, at least he had an identity as the stealthy assassin. While as Kaulder he's just another grunting protagonist despite the presentable physique or the grand attire.The Last Witch Hunter is a fantasy foray filled with shallow parlor tricks and incompatible hero in Vin Diesel. It had potential to be spectacular, but the shoddy presentation only offers pedestrian exhibition.",The Last Witch Hunter
55,Screen_Blitz,Very bland and forgettable,3,19 January 2016,"Vin Diesel has made himself a household name in Hollywood with his charismatic role in the Fast and Furious franchise as well as playing the titular character in the Riddick trilogy. In this fantasy action thriller directed by Bresk Eisner and produced by Mark Canton, Diesel plays Kaulder, a witch-hunter cursed with eternal life and devastated by the murder of his wife and daughter, who must stop a plague unleashed by the Witch Queen (played by Julie Engelbrecht) who he killed centuries ago, from destroying New York City as well as the whole world itself, with the help of a redheaded bartender Chloe (played by Rose Leslie) and his young accomplice (played by Elijah Wood). Combining this fantasy movie with Gothic horror elements, what director Breck Eisner brings to this movie is an compelling premise, but what about the rest of the movie? That is where this film takes a stab wound. When examining the picture from a narrative development standpoint, the flaws are easily recognized, and there is only little redeeming quality to distract from the spiritless fantasy- action fare this turns out to be.Aside from the interesting premise, this movie is unfortunately forgettable. In the opening scene, we are introduce to Vin Diesel with rather fake looking hair pieces, as a witch hunter trudging through a snowy canyon with his crew, what later comes is an intense fight against the witch queen filled with run-of-the-mill special effects, but also some exciting action. From there on, the movie descends from any sort of excitement and the plot ceases to make much sense. The entire first half is quite tedious and moves at a needlessly slow pace, to the point where it is difficult to pay much attention. Instead of treating us with exciting action sequences, it wastes its time on needless exposition and convoluted storytelling, and the characters are so uninteresting. Along with Vin Diesel's character who is the only character to spark much charisma, the rest of characters are a bit bland, especially Elijah Wood's character who is bit underused. Those who are able to sit through the seemingly long hour and a half get to experience an climatic fight scene at the end, the only redeeming quality of the film.The Last Witch Hunter is very bland and forgettable, a movie that had so much potential that sadly goes wasted by confused storytelling, slow pacing, and incomprehensible characters. It is quite disappointing, especially as it stars Vin Diesel who has really made himself a big action star.",The Last Witch Hunter
56,Troy_Campbell,Rubbish end of the Vin spectrum.,3,30 October 2015,"The choice to watch a Vin Diesel flick comes hand-in-hand with the acceptance that you're either going to get B-grade fun or Z-grade trash. And with Big Vin, the two can often be hard to tell apart. There's no such difficulty in placing this snorefest on the Vin spectrum of entertainment; it slots in comfortably on the complete-rubbish end of the scale. With the sort of vapid storyline that would be subpar even for a direct-to-DVD movie, this clichéd, dull and nonsensical actioner flounders at every turn, hoping to get by on style alone. It doesn't. Although there is a glimmer of inventiveness in a few set pieces, the action gets bogged down with messy editing, strangely bloodless violence and a ludicrous reliance on CGI that is, considering the $90m budget, indefensibly bad. For all of Vin's dubious acting talent he is nothing if not a passionate actor, yet again giving 100% to a job where he's fighting an uphill battle against everything from laughably clunky lines to horrendous cast support. Which brings us to the single worst element of the film: Rose Leslie. Delivering one of the most atrocious performances you'll ever see – with a U.S. accent so terrible it sounds like a speech defect – the Scottish actress should prepare her Razzie speech now. There is very little to compliment in The Last Witch Hunter, except that Vin gives his all and it's not as dire as Fantastic Four.",The Last Witch Hunter

58,Stephen_A_Abell,Riddick In The Light... 'ish...,6,14 February 2018,"So way back when witches roamed the land so did Witch Hunters. Kaulder (Diesel) and his gang are hinting the Witch Queen who is intent on the destruction of the human race. The battle between Queen and mortals is fast and furious with everyone but Kaulder and the Queen being slain. In a last ditched attempt, Kaulder attacks and runs her through with his sword of fire. However, as witches are accustomed, she doesn't die easily... she curses Kaulder to immortality. However, judging by the notches on his bedpost this curse has backfired on the witch because it looks like he's enjoying life... not only does he have the women, but he has his own toys, fast cars, and a penthouse... when can I get cursed that bad(?)So this is pretty much a Vin Diesel vehicle and to be honest, it's kinda like Riddick without the contact lenses. There's at least an air of a mystery in the story, something is happening in the magic community and it's not good. What's happening? Who's behind it? What's the twist? All good questions, though all, are pretty easy to figure out. Mainly, because it's all been done before and maybe they didn't want to get too complicated and confusing as the film is aimed at a 12A audience. Any adult should know where this story is going and all the twist reveals well in advance of their actual reveal.Vin Diesel once again does a great job at being Vin Diesel... I would love to see him stretch his acting wings to take in a few more characterisations... or is he gonna be like Bruce Willis stuck in a rut being John McClane in every film he does? Can anybody remember when he was Hudson Hawk... But I digress, then you have Rose Leslie as Chloe... she's a strange one as sometimes she's great, then at others, a lump of wood. Similar can also be said for Elijah Wood as Dolan 37th (shouldn't that be The 37th Dolan or Dolan 37?). Most of the time he's on screen he gives out an appearance of uncaring. It's like he didn't want to be there. Other than Diesel, the only other actors who do well with their characters are Olafsson as Belial, brilliant as the hulk of a warlock, who is certain of his power and his mission. Michael Caine as Dolan 36th, a cheeky priest who has befriended Kaulder over his tenure. However, it's the direction, the special effects, and action scenes that will keep the audience entertained the most. Eisner is a good director and uses both camera shots, angles, pans, and lighting to his best advantage. It's also nice that he decided to keep the dark subterranean scenes well lit so you can see the action. It's also refreshing that in the action scenes he doesn't always opt for shaky cam. But, uses quick pans and cuts to add speed, tension, and excitement... phew, no seasickness pills needed.If the story had been stronger and some of the characters slightly upgraded it would have made this a much better venture. As it is, it's a leave your brain by the door, magical slobber knocker. Not too bad a way to waste an hour and a half... though if you're looking for original, this isn't it... or thought-provoking.I would recommend this to all viewers who want a not-all-together mindless entertainment. It's a one watch movie.",The Last Witch Hunter
59,one9eighty,"Swords & Guns - action fantasy, which probably feels like you've seen it before.",6,17 September 2018,"Starring Vin Diesel as Kaulder, a witch hunter, this film is an action/fantasy cross over. Kaulder (Vin Diesel) is made immortal by the Witch Queen, a punishment for killing her - to go through life, never having closure with nobody who can share experiences with for long. Fast Forward some 1000+years and Kaulder is in modern day America, still fighting the witches, or at least, policing them - as a truce exists between witches and humans. A new threat emerges from the old world and Kaulder has to work out where and who the threat is, in order to stop it. This film wasn't as cheesy as I anticipate, it's got enough pace and action to keep things going. There are plenty of stars in the film, from Michael Caine, Elijah Wood and Rose Lesley to name a few, and the action is generally a tasteful mix of live action and CGI. The issue I had was that it felt as though I'd seen the plot unfold in other films before, in fact, ten minutes into it I turned to my girlfriend and provided a potential ending, which turned out to be a spoiler as it came true. Lots of clichés, lots of tongue in cheek moments, lots of Vin Diesel doing the same he's done in other movies. If you like sword and gun action which mixes action with fantasy, you'll love this. I thought it was average and missed an opportunity to be better. 6 out of 10.",The Last Witch Hunter

61,dave-mcclain,"This movie is good enough to become known as the first ""Last Witch Hunter"".",6,24 October 2015,"Darned witches! Why can't they just leave us alone? For no apparent reason, a whole coven of them tormented a town full of bored teenage girls in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1692. (Come on, witches! Wasn't the fact that those girls had to wait another 200+ years for cell phones and Facebook torture enough??) Then, in 1900, a book documented how one witch kept bothering this poor little girl named Dorothy who just wanted to grab her dog and get back to Kansas. (But why would anyone want to get BACK to Kansas?) Then, in the late 20th and early 21st century, all sorts of mean and evil witches kept getting in the way of that Harry Potter chap. (And all he wanted to do was make a few movies about his life, so he could move on and make some really bad movies.) You'd think that all this mischief and all the TV series that witches get to appear in these days would be enough for them, but NO, they have to try to destroy the whole human race! That's the set-up for ""The Last Witch Hunter"" (PG-13, 1:46).Diesel stars as the title character, a man named Kaulder. We don't know what his first name is, but let's just say it's Ron. It seems appropriate for a witch hunter, especially if he's listed last name first, in an alphabetized list of professional witch hunters. Well, that probably is a moot point, seeing as Kaulder is the LAST witch hunter. Although he looks young enough to drive a fast car parachuting from the back of an airplane, he's actually 800 years old (give or take). When he and a bunch of other rough-looking medieval swordsmen storm the lair of the Witch Queen (Julie Engelbrecht), Kaulder's flaming sword runs her through, but with her dying breath she curses him with her own immortality. Now, he's condemned to live alone and forever mourn the deaths of his wife and daughter. (He's a medieval hero, so, of course, someone has killed his wife and young child.) On the bright side, the Witch Queen's demise also ended her attempt to wipe out all of humanity with the infamous Black Plague.Fast forward to present day New York City. Kaulder has outlived his fellow witch hunters by about 780 years (give or take) and it falls to him to keep the surviving witches' evil at bay. And he's been very successful. He has an aide, called a Dolan, specifically assigned to him by ""The Order of the Axe and Cross"", a secret group within the Catholic Church, which assists with and documents Kaulder's mission. As the movie opens, Dolan 36 (Michael Caine) is retiring and Dolan 37 (Elijah Wood) is set to succeed him. The night before the Dolanizing ceremony, Dolan 36 is found dead. Kaulder considered 36 a good friend and suspects there is something more to his passing than the usual lack of immortality. He's right. With 37 at his side, Kaulder investigates the emergence of an evil he hasn't seen in eight centuries.This whole Dolan 36 murder mystery threatens to undermine a truce between witches and humans that has lasted since Kaulder vanquished the Witch Queen. Witches have lived among us since then and have been allowed to practice their dark arts, as long as they didn't use their magic on humans. Rather than try to hunt down and kill all witches, Kaulder has to focuses his efforts. (After all, how much can one person do? The man's 800 years old, for goodness sakes!) What he does is find rogue witches, especially those who break the rules of the truce, and delivers them to a council of witches who sentence the guilty to an eternal state of suspended animation. In this case, however, finding the offending witch won't be enough for Kaulder. He suspects that what's happening is much bigger than one bad witch trying to spoil the witches' brew. Kaulder teams up with a witch named Chloe (Rose Leslie) and they work together for the sake of both his people and her kind. Along the way, we learn that Chloe is a witch with special powers that not all witches possess – and she's going to need all the powers that she can muster. Bubbling beneath the surface of this whole cauldron of discontent is a very dangerous secret and an even more dangerous conspiracy that could make for a really bad day for everybody.""The Last Witch Hunter"" is a very personal project for Diesel – and it shows – in both good ways and bad. This movie would have been out earlier, but filming was pushed back when production on ""Furious 7"" was delayed following Paul Walker's death. Kaulder is actually based on Diesel's own witch hunter character that he uses as an avid Dungeons and Dragons player. Unfortunately, for all Diesel's devotion to this project, his characterization of Kaulder feels a bit odd. Rather than giving us an understandably serious and tortured character who has his light moments, we get a man whose modern-day version seems too light-hearted, with all he's been through in his past and all he's dealing with in his present.Aside from certain moments in Diesel's uneven performance, the rest of the movie's pretty entertaining. The little-known supporting cast is surprisingly good. I like the tie-in with actual historical events, but the progression of the story is vague. (It's probably Europe, but we don't really know where the big scene at the Witch Queen's headquarters takes place. And we never learn how or why Kaulder chose New York City for his current base of operations, or much else from the previous 800 years.) The story (a supernatural version of ""Men in Black"") and the action are very good and the visuals are great. I give this one a mild recommendation and predict that this will not be the last ""Last Witch Hunter"". ""B""",The Last Witch Hunter

64,Seth_Rogue_One,Did witches set a magic spell on all these viewers giving this a high rating?,3,21 January 2016,"I can't imagine that they would otherwise, cause this movie is one of the worst movies of 2015.It's amazing to me that someone actually wrote this script and not only did it get green-lit, it got funded with 90 million dollars!To say that this movie has a lot of plot-holes is an understatement, the most random of hocus pocus gets thrown in at the most random moments; magic stones, portal, memory-travelling and monster-trees yes, monster- trees I'm not talking about trees filled with monsters either I'm talking about trees running around trying to kill poor Vin Diesel and his friends.Speaking of Vin Diesel, he really outdid himself in this one in terms of being bad, the worst performance I've seen from him, he can be decent occasionally but here he's flat out terrible.Not that the rest of the cast is that much better though, Elijah Wood who I like a lot usually really doesn't appear to try very hard in his performance, but who could blame him when his character is written so poorly.Michael Caine, shows up here and there but not much more than that.Rose Leslie isn't terrible but she can't save the movie, but I don't think anyone could have at this stage.The movie also felt like it was heavily edited (96 minutes without credits) but tbh I think that could have been because they knew they made a movie that didn't make any kind of sense so they cut it down to make the viewer focus on the action instead, hoping that would be enough.Another issue is that the tone of the movie is too serious, clearly you'd want to go a more humorous route when the script is this silly.Watch 'Hansel & Gretel: Witch hunters (2013)' instead, sure that also had it's random hocus pocus here and there but at least the film-makers made sure to have a little fun with it, and it is a much better movie as well compared with this.I can't believe that there are actual plans to make a sequel to 'The Last Witch Hunter (2015)'.",The Last Witch Hunter

66,Likes_Ninjas90,"Maybe the flaws are proof that audiences are, we can hope, becoming better at sniffing out a fizzer and refusing to encourage mediocrity",4,31 October 2015,"Someone in Hollywood decided that slaying witches was a strong financial investment and one that befitted the current day Christian and conservative ideologue of the film industry. Christianity's influence in Hollywood and subsequent right-wing values have resonated with audiences in the various superhero films and major franchises like Twilight. A film franchise about a battle between the Church and witches, drawing from a dark chapter of Christian- American history, would surely have tapped into the conservative dialogue and consequently developed a popular fanbase. Adding Vin Diesel to the leading role would also seem like a recipe for success given the popularity of his Fast and Furious franchise and his voice work in Guardians of the Galaxy. His confidence in this very silly mixture of action, horror and magic was evident in his choice to become one of the film's executive producers.While Hollywood's bean counters worked overtime to calculate a formula of political, financial and perhaps even artistic success, The Last Witch Hunter had a dismal time at the US box office. It has, so far, failed to return half of its $70 million dollar budget. We often scoff at how mediocrity relishes the box office but maybe quality was a factor this time and one that overrode the special effects and star power. After all, this film also features Michael Caine and Elijah Wood, both of whom have contributed to the haulings of major franchises with Batman and The Lord of the Rings, respectively. While acting as an executive producer, Diesel's call to hire Breck Eisner to direct the film is one that's backfired. This is Eisner's first film in five years since The Crazies (2010) and even longer since the action-comedy Sahara (2004). He doesn't bring tension to the proceedings, nor does he frame action pieces, like the opening ambush scene, in a clear or exciting manner, free of muddiness and confusion. Previously, Russian filmmaker Timur Bekmambetov, famous for the Night Watch and Day Watch films before he went to Hollywood, was attached to direct the film.The distinction, flavour or general weirdness Bekmambetov might have brought would have been most welcome. The film's lore and plotting are stale, with the protagonist said to be inspired by Vin Diesel's love of the game Dungeons and Dragons, which he's played for twenty years. This adolescence is perpetuated by the film's derivative attempts to mirror similarly trash franchises like the dreaded Underworld vampire series. Like Underworld, ancient mythology is juxtaposed with the modern world. The latter is at the forefront here because this is not a medieval story. It merely starts in that time period with Kaulder (Diesel) and his fellow warriors tracking the Witch Queen down in her lair. The moment Kaulder believes he's defeated her, she curses him so he'll live forever. The story forwards to the present day New York, where the film is almost entirely placed, thereby reducing the necessity for elaborate ancient sets and costumes. Kaulder is still a witch hunter but is now living in the city during a truce period between the witches and the Axe and Cross group, whose council who is essentially the Vatican and opting to imprison witches in an underground cave after they've sentenced them. Kaulder's mentor is the priest Dolan 36th (Michael Caine), who advises him to find some company in his life. Dolan 36th dies after declaring his retirement and Kaulder enlists the help of Dolan 37th (Elijah Wood) and a witch named Chloe (Rose Leslie), who runs a bar, to investigate the mystery of his death.A mild diversion, one of the few drawn from the film, is considering whether it is brutal against witches or not. In an interesting line of dialogue, the only one that resonates in the weak script, is when Kaulder says that the Salem witch trials were ""a mistake and those women were innocent"". However, it's not much of a spoiler to say that his showdown will be with an old foe, meaning whether or not its progressive is really a moot point. Other lines like ""I promise I'll find who did this and break the curse!"" are straight out of a generic screen writing template. It's also cringing to see the ageless Michael Caine working with material far beneath him, as he spouts lines about the witch prison or reassuring Kaulder that he's defeated his enemy once and he can do it again! Much of the dialogue is flat because Vin Diesel's baritone voice scrapes each one out and shows no emotional range. He's not as fun or as comically snarky as a comparable actor like Bruce Willis either. He regularly plays men that are anti- heroes but his one-dimensional character, with a dead family of course, isn't embedded into a story with any tension or surprises. It's terribly predictable and derivative and can't even keep track of its main players as it becomes muddled by fantasy flashback trance scenes when Chloe uses her powers to help Kauldel discover what happened in his past. Michael Caine's character only features at the beginning and end of the film and 37 is forgotten for a long stretch, only to return at the end with a ridiculous and underdeveloped twist, shoehorned in between the superfluous special effects. What else needs to be said? Maybe these flaws are proof that audiences are, we can hope, becoming better at sniffing out a fizzer and refusing to encourage mediocrity.",The Last Witch Hunter
67,billygoat1071,Seeking for a New Mythology,5,22 October 2015,"The Last Witch Hunter is a supernatural action film that is generally fond on establishing its own mythology than anything else. And honestly, it works, perhaps only because it helped glossing out the weaknesses of the plot and the action scenes. Some strange ideas are better than the others, but the plot is just dumb, what's worse are the twists, resulting the entire film as a generic schlock despite of the neat world they are building up. Some visuals can look cool and there are reasons to chill onto this universe that makes no sense. And that is much it: it's not fun enough, neither clever enough.k The movie moves its story like you are seeing an already existing property; while you hear familiar jargon that relates to the fantasy genre, we are also introduced to new legends, like the Witch Queen or this centuries old organization called the Axe and Cross. There are witches that need to be slain, while there are ones that for some reason are allowed to roam around. We don't quite see how this world affects, more specifically, the modern times; we assume the less dangerous witches are just goths. To sum it up; evil witches still exist and Kaulder (Vin Diesel) is the only one who can stop them in this time. And the movie keeps digging within this mythology than throwing in another action set piece, which is kind of an interesting turn, and even having anything substantial within the storyline. Though some ideas are appealing, like how one priest of every generation are devoted to serve the witch hunter (despite that they're kind of needless, at least based on what we saw.) The scenes that involve these priests are intriguing, probably because they're such an odd misfit with its protagonist. It's amusingly intriguing having Vin Diesel and Elijah Wood potentially sparking a strange chemistry together as a mismatch duo. Unfortunately, the movie wants to be conventional and finds Kaulder a more competent sidekick.Put the world building aside, the plot is too simple, yet so dumb. It's basically just finding out the plan of the villains instead of actually chasing them. At one point, they manage to meet face-to-face for an action scene, but the heroes rather go detective work for a friend who is comatose by a curse, it keeps building this world without developing much of the plot, the major twist bogs the story big time, in which they could have done it simpler without coming across with other places for the sake of telling the audience that this is a rich universe. Everything else about this ""universe"" isn't quite as inspired as it thinks. The hero himself is just one of those non-aging protagonists who broods about the misery of their immortality. The main antagonist is also a stock villain whose threat is only defined by its aesthetic. Again, the supporting characters are a lot interesting for bringing distinct flavor here, well, hypothetically. The dream-walking though is sort of tough to follow, but anyway.The acting is nothing special, either. Although Vin Diesel tries to be different by showing a charisma, but that lighter side didn't shine enough in the performance. Rose Leslie does try to make her role somewhat appealing, but it didn't shine enough either. Elijah Wood presence alone kind of brought the oddness, more or less, while Michael Caine brought some warmth in a minor role, however isn't quite convincing of being someone who is supposed to be younger than Vin Diesel, but that idea alone is ridiculous anyway to work, unless the script was any stronger than this. The visual effects are cool enough for its own good, while the action scenes, though watchable, are nothing memorable.No matter how much the movie builds its universe, trying to reserve the action for the sake of focusing on how ""fascinating"" this new mythology is, it's still kind of a generic action film, suffers with a few yet big clichés and wasted opportunities. Maybe only a silly person like me would have think that a supernatural buddy action film starring an immortal Vin Diesel and a priest Elijah Wood as the main concept is a better idea than what the movie ended up to be. What makes a cinematic or a grand fictional universe appealing is its distinctness and creativity in plot, characters and inspirations. The latter slightly does get there, except the formers are the ones that suffer. My expectations might be too ludicrous to work, but hey, strangeness are at least interesting. Though, what generally lacks here is enough pizazz of making the diversions engaging. The surface is still pretty good to look at and granted, mind traveling witches and padre sidekicks are nice. All we need is a plot that actually goes somewhere, a novel hero and a truly threatening villain.",The Last Witch Hunter

72,dcarsonhagy,I Put a Spell on You,6,24 February 2016,"""The Last Witch Hunter"" tells a story of a grand witch slayer, Kaulder. When the movie opens, Kaulder (played by Vin Diesel) slays the Witch Queen; however, before she dies, she curses Kaulder to live and never die, thus blocking him from reuniting with his family who was killed by the Queen. Flash forward to the future, and Kaulder has neatly changed with the times, blending in as just another face. Little does he know, though, the Queen's minions are busy trying to resurrect her.

The talents of the great Rose Leslie are wasted in this movie. If you have seen her in ""Game of Thrones,"" you know this is a lady that can act and is no stranger to mixing it up with the guys when it comes to action.

But he seems to drive the action well only when he is behind the wheels. Apart from the Fast and Furious franchise, we have rarely seen him successfully take a movie to a bad-ass fruition.The Last Witch Hunter is anything but a good action movie. The witch action depicted was overshadowed by the cranky looking disgusting witch- faces and the flick's average CGI. At one point the growing roots and branches of the trees looked so animated, I wondered if I walked in for an animated movie. The action ends up without a proper focus and it becomes hard to concentrate. Also, it was horrifically limited. The plot is downright outrageous. The minute I saw Vin give a cheesy one liner to the air hostess in the beginning scene, I at once understood, what I was in for. The story contains a prologue and a follow up eventually to connect the dots, which could have been directed beautifully had we not Breck Eisner to helm this flick. The concept of the movie is based on sheer fantasy, which if not depicted well, naturally goes to the toilet. So, if there is nothing engaging to watch, you automatically slip into a jaded zone. Rose Leslie's role is that of a Dream Walker. She's like a walking pensieve. (and Harry Potter winks!) Without a proper story she gets hazy too. Michael Caine is there in the flick just to converse with Vin, and to go into a coma. He did the latter quite well. Elijah Wood's role headed towards naught. He should have never left his Frodo bags.What I also almost forgot to mention, is the fact that the movie is really boring. You will be hit by a sudden indifference with all the witch-crap they throw at you without a proper explanation.

If you expect horror going to see The Last Witch Hunter, you're bound to be disappointed. It's not a horror movie - I wouldn't be seeing it if I thought it would be. This is another one of the sort of comics heroes of a new sort that Vin Diesel specializes at. Check almost all his roles, he's always creating a super tough guy, which is a borderline superhero, and very often an actual superhero without the costume. That's why he's always looking for new franchises, cinematic franchises are the modern day equivalent of comics superheroes. They carry on from one episode to the next never ending, as long as there's demand for the product. I love comics, especially sci-fi comics, and fantasy as I stated more than once is a variation of sci-fi. Now sci-fi comics aren't real sci-fi,they use the sci-fi elements to create a setting for the heroes. Same is true with any other sort of comics, the only important thing is that you can always create a new sequel, a new episode.Considering all that, TLWH, is doing it's job very nicely. It has plenty of action, good CGI (it's not a surprise anymore, but it's still worth mentioning). It does call for a lot of suspension of judgment, and the plot itself is not always very consistent, (i'd rate it higher if it was). The acting is all right, Vin does come out a bit wooden at moments, but as a rule he's a much better actor than he's given credit for - as long as he stays inside his comfort zone.

77,Quebec_Dragon,Not-so-typical witches-hunter,7,22 October 2015,"Besides short segments taking place in the Middle Ages and another on a plane, this supernatural flick takes place in modern New York. We have Vin Diesel's character, Kaulder, a man who lost his family due to witches, still alive after 800 years and still hunting them. One would think that Kaulder would be a stereotypical stoic, somber, asocial killing machine, but such is not quite the case. I was pleasantly surprised to find Vin Diesel more smiling and ""human"" than usual. In fact, on more than one occasion, his hero actually showed restraint and compassion, which was quite refreshing. After that Middle-Ages intro, I thought all the witches would be evil, despicable, one-dimensional creatures (which would have been boring) but then again, I was fooled as we actually delved more into the modern witch community.As far as story goes, despite the seemingly cliché setup, I'd say it was stronger than usual for that kind of supernatural-action film with a few good twists I didn't see coming. The special effects were rather good and I especially liked how the magic was so nature-oriented (as it should be for witches). One of the neatest places was that bar with the subtle light magic. I also liked the design of the old witches and that bone sentinel. There was visual stuff there I hadn't actually seen before or at least a dozen times over. Unfortunately, I found the action scenes somewhat weak in general. I know that close-in fighting is supposed to be messy and chaotic but the cuts here were sometimes so poorly done I had trouble knowing what was happening. Thankfully, it's never as bad as in that first fight in the past, and it does get better as the film goes on. So don't go in expecting to be thrilled too much by the quality of the action.Surrounding the more-emotional-than-usual Diesel, there's actually a pretty decent cast including Michael Caine (always classy), Elijah Wood (amusing and solid) and Rose Leslie, that redhead wild woman from Game of Thrones. For me, she was the highlight acting-wise and elevated everything up a dramatic notch. As for the directing, besides the poor action and annoying flares, it was competent but not particularly memorable. The ""dream"" visions were nice, but then they usually are. I saw this at a preview screening and there wasn't much crowd reaction, however it should be noted that the film kept my (very) jaded interest throughout. I didn't have trouble with the pacing or story confusion as other reviewers did. I actually found the world of the Last Witch Hunter somewhat intriguing and enjoyable.Rating: 7 out of 10 (good)",The Last Witch Hunter

I loved the visual effects that were used a lot throughout the whole movie, they were colourful, the nature environment was beautiful and I also liked how original the Queen Witch looked. I liked the gothic setting in the visions from the past, I liked how the story was slowly revealing itself as the movie progressed, altho it was confusing at some points because of that. The only negative aspect was the lack of quality action scenes, but we've all seen a lot of Vin Diesel in action, so who needs them here anyway.",The Last Witch Hunter

82,BigGuy,A bit plodding for an Action movie,6,22 October 2015,"I didn't dislike this movie, but I was hoping for more. I really thought that Vin Diesel would get into this role, being a role-playing game fan, but he was a bit flat. Maybe he was trying to portray the been-alive-for-800-years angst, but it came across as just flat.I think the biggest problem with the movie is that it tried to include too much world-building, but didn't give the world building enough time to pay-off. Normally, I don't think movies should add material, but I think having Kaulder (or others) move through the world a little longer before introducing the main story arc would have helped tremendously. Instead it's a bunch of characters showing up long enough to give Kaulder a quest item, and then disappearing.Overall, it's a popcorn adventure movie with a fantasy overlay. Nothing too taxing for the viewer, but nothing too memorable either. I won't go into the tropes fulfilled, but they are numerous. So if you can check your expectations at the door, you'll have a fun diversion for a couple hours, if not then you might want to avoid this movie.",The Last Witch Hunter

86,autisticreviewers,Autistic Reviewers opinion on this movie.,4,9 November 2015,"I remember first reading about this movie when it was in production years ago. I was thinking to myself just how well this could have worked. The write story, the write acting, the write direction, the write effects and cinematography. Sadly, all of them goes way down the drain! First of all, me and Nick (The Autistic Reviewers) are a huge fan of Vin Diesel. He has proved many times that he is a cool guy, such as in the fast And Furious Franchise, XXX, the Riddick movies etc. And he definitely gives us that in this flick...the problem...is...that that is exactly why this movie didn't work at all. We have a Witch Hunter who has been around and lived for hundreds of years and you would think that it would have such a huge back story and something we can all look at and go ""That is really touching and admiring"", instead (like said up above) we get the ""too cool for school"" Vin Diesel just being himself with no back story, no morals and simply no feelings towards his character what so ever. I don't blame Vin Diesel for this, I blame the writers, and possibly the director. Had this of gone into further looking into and more intelligent writing I believe this movie could have been pulled off way better.The effects are just way over the top. Some of them look like something a 15 year old kid could do on photo shop in the blink of an eye. The effects just looked so cheap and used way too much.The acting by Michael Cane and Rose Leslie are good. Rose Leslie plays the witch who can take you to a place of flashbacks in your life. She's hot, she's sexy and she's perfect! Michael Cane is great in no matter how bad the movie is. Pity he did not get more screen time and was only in it for 5-10 mins.And there is a twist at the end involving Elijah Wood which was completely laughable and unnecessary. All in all, it is not a disaster. It is watchable, but I would never see it again. I would stick to Riddick or even Hansel And Gretel: Witch Hunters. 4/10- Jay",The Last Witch Hunter
87,lois-lane33,Not worth seeing if you are a true fan of horror movies.,4,22 October 2015,"I saw this in a 'sneak preview' screening before the regular release. I thought it was derivative of so many other films/related projects it was hard to keep track of them-Transformers, Highlander, Lord of the Rings & that Keanu Reeves film about a demon hunting priest called Constantine & Star Trek Voyager's Borg Queen episodes just to name a few.Vin Diesel isn't the kind of actor who works well in a dramatic type of movie and anything about witchcraft that works cinematographically has to have strong drama elements to it. Michael Caine having a part in this movie probably saved it from total obscurity. Overdone special effects and light in the brain department scripting make this film forgettable. It will no doubt spawn a TV series somewhere down the road as well as numerous sequels but I doubt that they will be any improvement on this fine example of mindless overkill style filmmaking. Also the element of the occult in this film bear no relationship to any legends/folklore that existed anywhere in the world at any time. The supporting actress was cute.

89,lucasversantvoort,Wasted potential,5,18 November 2015,"The Last Witch Hunter is a classic case of wasted potential. As I was watching it, I was blown away by how many interesting stories could have been told. As it is now, it's a regular action flick...but I guess that was apparent with the name Vin Diesel splayed on the poster.It's the year....actually I don't know when we are, but there's a bunch of Vikings talking about killing a witch queen, so we at least know what's going on...sort of. Vin Diesel kills the witch queen, but she senses his tragic past involving his dead wife and child and before she dies condemns him to live forever. Cut to present day New York where Diesel is part of a covenant dedicated to locking up witches. He has an old adviser, played by Michael Caine (who seems to be trying to usurp Morgan Freeman's position as the King of Narrators), called a *sigh* Dolan (yes, seriously) who one evening discusses with Diesel his loneliness. Diesel's lived so long, he says, but there's a difference between living and 'living', you see. The next day, Caine turns up dead. A new Dolan played by Elijah Wood (who seems cursed to play creepy roles which I think might be due to his haircut) is inaugurated. They find out black magic was involved and so together they start looking for the one responsible. This leads them to discover that the dead witch queen might not be as dead as they thought.The main source of tension here is the presence of lots of world-building without actually making good on any of it. You've got Vikings vs witches, modern-day witch hunters and the reference to how Diesel's immortality made him witness the likes of Napoleon and Stalin. Can you imagine Vin Diesel battling witches in those time periods? Instead, the filmmakers felt the need to bring the concept of witches and witch hunters to the present. The film throws all these rules and words at us, but they don't mean anything; they're just that, words. And deep down we know the film doesn't care either. Watching Ygritte, I mean Rose Leslie, talk about 'snowdonia's' with a straight face is something else. All this world-building just ends up being frustrating, because you start wondering what the film would look like had any of it actually been relevant in the end.The character development is lackluster and it's not just because Diesel's not exactly a character actor, though he compensates with likability (and that gravelly voice that theatre speakers make more booming every day). The story tries to make his curse, his immortality, seem so dramatic, but Diesel doesn't seem too upset about it and neither does the film seem anxious to pursue this dramatic angle. Can you imagine how interesting it would be had the film focused on this notion of living forever? How it would influence the way you see the world and so on? Ugh, there's so much I could critique story-wise, but I don't want to be here all night. Rose Leslie plays the sexy redhead witch who ends up being Diesel's love interest which I can't see happening in any kind of reality. The Big Bad witch complains about how humans are the intruders, the real villains and so on. Imagine if this was turned into the real story, where humans and witches realize they both see each other as the invaders and so on. Maybe, in the end, they'd realize they're not so differ--Ha! Who am I kidding? Just blow their heads off with a shotgun.To its credit, the film is occasionally pretty to look at, though this argument tends to feel more like a fail-safe nice guy comment: 'the movie sucks, but hey, at least it looks nice'. I can't in all honesty recommend The Last Witch Hunter. Though it has a consistent tone and few dumb jokes, the amount of wasted potential is very frustrating. Maybe its inevitable sequel will improve on what's wrong with it (aka everything), but I wouldn't hold your breath.",The Last Witch Hunter

91,gerry_barnaby,Almost a perfect film a little slow but story is fantastic,8,21 October 2015,"First of all you gonna see a lot of people putting this film down giving it bad ratings, well sadly these people have their own opinion on that. So I'm gonna give my honest opinion on this film, yes it not perfect pacing is a little off, but the film as a whole was fantastic miles better than seventh son film that was out a few months ago. The film start off with a solid introduction into the dark age battling an ancient evil witch that has the power of the elements & earth were throw into a 10min scene of them hunt her down, here were introduced to the main character KAULDER (Vin Diesel) a valiant warrior on the hunt with other solider hunting this evil down. This is what good about the film it doesn't just throw you into a story leaving plot holes at the beginning not knowing why Kaulder became immortal, it actually explain this within the first 10mins of the film so it not only give you a background story it also give's the film something to work with as the story progress's. Would i agree on this being a 12A no, because their are a few scene through this film that go above that certification, special some of the horror scene in the film from my own viewing this would be frightening for anyone under the age of 15 as they do tend to get extremely intense. The acting is pretty solid as well, it well balance film although missing some emotional opportunity that could of been put in there but i feel this as because of the pacing of the film that drown that out, but the special effect where outstanding show a perfect horror theme on a extremely danger spirit of a witch that could destroy the world, this is a perfect concept of the way they have the witch looking like a elemental wrath was a perfect look for the evil watch & completely sell the character. I was surprise to see Michael Caine in this film although i feel his scene are cameo as they are short scene's throughout the film, as i feel Elijah Wood is on screen more, but both do a great job in selling the film.Ólafur Darri Ólafsson was perfect cast choice to play the evil witch's Disciple Belial , he had the right look for this type of character, he come off on screen someone to actual fear, Rose Leslie (game of thrones) perfect cast choice for the female role to join Kaulder in the fight to save the world from evil, she done a perfect performance with her character really sell it on screen. Along with its special effect,story concept & characters this is one of the best witch concept films to been see in a long while, that is worth watching that end in a climactic battle of light vs darkness that promises a unique franchise. Dislikes : The only thing really that lets this film down but not full letting the film down is the pacing it tends to jump from an action to slow parts which make the film slight slow, i feel this film could of been a little faster while keep its story the way it was, i would have said this was a 10 out of 10 film, but the slowness pulls it down slightly but still a great film.",The Last Witch Hunter
92,HorrorOverEverything,"Mediocre, Predictable, and Boring",3,21 January 2016,"I'm not dumb, I knew what to expect when I put this on. I wasn't expecting some Tarantino esque film with tons of heart and interesting dialogue. I was ready for some mindless monster action along the lines of Underworld or Blade, unfortunately none of that was to be found. Instead ""The Last Witch Hunter"" plays out like a very shallow detective movie with a very unlikable detective. Vin Diesal just didn't work in this, Vin isn't in movies because of his acting chops, he is in movies because we love to watch him be a badass. In this though he is basically just walking around investigating clues while we are treated to some pretty lame CGI. There is very little action in the movie and the few action scenes that do take place are pretty underwhelming.

93,goolizap,Twizard Rating: 69,7,1 December 2015,"Vin Diesel's charisma may not be enough to save a movie that is this pedestrian. A rough script is one thing--I mean, Diesel has been known to take a couple--but at it's best it's just a stylistic exposition with too many rules built into the film universe.Full of plot holes and convoluted details is The Last Witch Hunter, a tale about a man (Diesel) cursed with immortality by a witch in the middle ages, only to ward off the same evil 800 years later in New York City.I applaud the film for a couple of clever plot twists that keep the audience involved and attentive, but I constantly feel like I'm playing catchup with everything else. It will give us a motif or a totem to remember early on and then refer to it much later, after not mentioning it in between, assuming that we remember its significance. More or less, the plot is simple enough to follow. But the confusing details surrounding the events feel included to stretch out the premise.The Last Witch Hunter is attractive stylistically as it utilizes some cool props and spells, but the use of CGI--albeit few and far between--reminds us that we're watching a movie.The film tries creating depth for our lead character by showing us flashbacks of his wife and child. But the only thing is they serve no purpose to the story--literally. It's forced and keeps the movie untrue to itself, reminding us even more how little depth he has. We really just want to see Diesel go around hunting witches--as the title describes.Another sign of forced-depth is the use of trite dialogue that merely sounds good in the moment, while having no real meaning or relevance to the premise.The Last Witch Hunter isn't a boring movie at all--perhaps is strongest trait--but after it's finished we long for a better understanding of what we just watched.Twizard Rating: 69",The Last Witch Hunter
94,CherryBlossomBoy,Slow and a far cry from furious,3,26 October 2015,"Clearly timed, in fact rushed, for the upcoming Halloween holiday (no big revelation here), this horror-schlock is resembling a typical holiday souvenir stand: an assortment of cheap, popular items, all mixed up together without taste or general concept, but everyone that stops by will find something to one's liking. Vin Diesel and his helium-soaked voice are sleepwalking through the main role just like the stand employee, who is in his mind at home with his family, but he just has to make it through the shift somehow.Diesel makes it, in some sort of brooding, drab performance, thinking that this is how one portrays a tired old man, which is what his character is supposed to be. The story that revolves around him is a convoluted mixture of popular horror motives and ideas from bigger and lesser films, and first that come to mind are ""Highlander"", ""Blade"", ""Underworld"", ""Mummy"" and ""Constantine"". Really, if you've seen any of those five - don't bother with this one, it will bore you to untimely death.If you, however, do wish to pay tribute to the Halloween by seeing a suitable film, prepare for one that is unevenly and uninspiredly directed and acted, filmed in a generic, overly dark cinematography that will from time to time be interrupted by jarringly kitschy and colorful dream-shots. There may be some art in all that but it is as nonsensical as all the complicated rules the film throws at the viewer in many boring expository scenes - which then itself forgets to follow (the script must have come directly from some goth kid's diary). There is a couple of twists thrown in to atone for the absence of a proper culmination. There are some history lessons, just to try to make the story relevant. There are also Michael Caine and Elijah Wood, making underwritten and probably expensive cameos. There's the predictable ending and a set up for the sequel.If they promise the Plague wins the next time, I'm up for it all the way.

100,keithlovesmovies,The Last Witch Hunter Review,6,22 November 2015,"The world as we know it holds many secrets. Most importantly, witches still live among us. Centuries ago, Kaulder (Vin Diesel) managed to kill the almighty Witch Queen (Julie Engelbrecht), eliminating her followers in the process. Before her death, she cursed the valiant warrior with her own immortality, separating him from his wife and daughter from the afterlife. Her resurrection now threatens the survival of the human race as Kaulder, the last of his kind, and his allies Chloe (Rose Leslie) and Dolan 36th and 37th (Michael Caine and Elijah Wood), face her vengeful wrath.I was interested in this one because I haven't seen a Vin Diesel movie that was neither fast nor furious (Yes, I know he was in Guardians of the Galaxy but he only voiced a character and didn't appear in person). It will say that it was weird at first for me watching this since I have always imagined him as his character from the Fast and the Furious series but that went away quickly. I also wasn't sure what the film was trying to be, a fantasy film or an action film. They set up the fantasy angle early on but I did not like the time jump after we see him kill the Witch Queen because that it is the only time Kaulder was actually a witch hunter. From then on that fact is only implied because they already established his history of being a witch hunter off screen during that time. So it was a little disappointing that a film called The Last Witch Hunter did not include any actual witch hunting. I did not like the pacing of the film either as it felt like most of its time was spent trying to stop the curse that was cast on Dolan 36th instead of advancing the plot by trying to figure out who was responsible for what was happening and we they did, try to stop them. The fact that Diesel's Kaulder was immortal was unnecessary to the plot as I felt it bogged the film down with his immortality making him feel alone, also you never really felt a sense of danger since his character can't die (and introduces the possibility of further films, of course), and it just doesn't feel right when Michael Caine's character is technically younger than Vin Diesel's character. Despite all of that, the story isn't overly original either so you can probably predict what's going to happen, except for maybe a twist at the end which was just stupid and felt forced. The action was decent in this one but you just can't ignore the excessive use of CGI here. When it's good, it's good but when it's bad, it's bad. I probably would have cared a little more about the characters if they weren't so one-dimensional. Some of the characters, especially Dolan 36th and 37th, were mostly in the background not really adding much to the plot. It was a shame because I am a big Michael Caine fan. Overall, The Last Witch Hunter is just your run-of-the-mill generic action movie that doesn't really bring anything new or original to the table but it is just a under two hour sequence of mindless fun.Score: 6/10 keithlovesmovies.com",The Last Witch Hunter

102,DBLurker,Pacing & editing is all over the place..,4,19 July 2017,"From terrible editing to pacing of the script and scenes, this movie just feels so weird.I liked the CGI. The visuals obviously had a lot of effort put into them and Vin Diesel works fine in his role without overdoing it, but the movie never really delivers on what you're expecting from it (you know, a lot of witch-hunting).The whole world is populated with witches but our hero apparently takes humane approach and only kills those that ""break the law"" or some rule which you as a viewer don't give a sh*t about. While we're at it, using Vin Diesel as a action hero is fine, but making him deliver lines next to actors who actually act is painful to see (that butler from Batman especially). Also, Elijah Wood's character is just underdeveloped and the movie forgets about it until the ""twist"" (which won't be a shock to anyone). Personally I think they should've casted someone with more sinister face in his place.Then there are random cuts, which happen because they either re-shot those scenes without caring much for continuity or cause the editor was just high on cocaine. Either way, they are jarring. What is even more jarring is the speed with which the whole plot flows jumping from scene to scene without developing anything lore-wise or character-wise.Movie is so-so. Watchable if you have nothing else to see since CGI and action scenes are well done (though action isn't really that amazing).",The Last Witch Hunter

I kind of didn't like a lot of it, like the new girlfriend or daughter or bartender sidekick.....and the craziness of the unsuspenseful thriller that went on and on for the benefit of Vin Disels character. The best part of the movie though was definitely the special effects. There is not much to talk about. I gave this film a seven because I think it will be good for you...and also just totally thought it was better than its coexisting Goosebumps. Right now I am trying to watch SUPERHERO movie, it has Leslie Nielsan in it. The only thing I'll be able to do while reviewing Goosebumps is dissect the characters relationship and why I didn't like most of the charactres.",The Last Witch Hunter
104,kimheniadis,"Love Vin Diesel, but not this movie.",4,12 February 2016,"Most people have that one actor or actress that they will watch anything they are in. For me, that's Vin Diesel. The first movie I saw him in was Pitch Black, and I have been enjoying his films ever since. I don't put too much stock into reviews by professional critics, since I often feel the opposite of what they do. So when I kept hearing not so positive reviews for The Last Witch Hunter, I still had hope for the movie. Alas, I should have listened this time.Spoilers Ahead.The storyline was decent, Vin Diesel's acting was good, as was Elijah Wood and Michael Caine's. To me, the best acting in this film went to Rose Leslie, and at this point if they make a part two, she'll be the reason I watch it.My biggest complaint was the CGI effects with all the flies, it was just used for so much of the movie. I know a month from now, if someone mentions this film, that's all I will remember. Sure they were integral to the story line, that's how you knew something bad was going to go down, but it wasn't even creepy or gross.Major Spoiler..My other problem was Elijah Wood, not his acting, but towards the end we find out that the Council that is supposed to be protecting human-kind has kept the heart of the evil witch. At that point, it was obvious that Wood was one of the bad guys. And from the conversation he and Diesel had, I thought it was supposed to be obvious to the witch hunter as well. Then we have them working together shortly after, only to have Wood bow to the queen witch. At this point Diesel's character starts beating on him for working with the queen. All I could think was, ""Duh!"", we already knew he was. so either it was bad writing, or I just thought something was in the previous dialogue/scene that was not really there. I would say skip this one, and just rewatch Pitch Black instead.",The Last Witch Hunter

Vin Diesel as usual was his exciting and active self , fighting off the 'badies' . Then in stepped Rosie Leslie as Chloe . It became a little bit weak . Her acting was atrocious. She was insipid . She couldn't pull off the character she was meant to play . There was also no chemistry or 'connection ' between her and Vin Diesel. The movie started to go downhill too. It became one big jumbled mess! It went from one scene to another and then another. It was as though the director was tripping ! Elijah Woods character was very predictable too. It's.

107,ryanmark-57919,Lots of Style and Absolutely no Substance,5,26 October 2015,"I was really hoping this would turn out to be a good movie but I had my reservations after seeing the trailers. The dialogue just seemed like some corny throw away tripe that I probably could have written in eight grade. I always go into a film hoping it'll be good, even if I'm pretty sure it won't be. This movie isn't necessarily good but it's entertaining enough if there isn't anything else to watch. The film is directed by Breck Eisner, who isn't really known for directing anything noteworthy, at least not in my opinion. Let's get to the story.So, witches and humans in the 21st century have a truce that neither side will hurt or hunt the other. If any witches break this truce then an immortal witch hunter named Kaulder (Vin Diesel) is sent out to either destroy or capture them. Kaulder actually slayed the Witch Queen (Julie Engelbrecht) 800 hundred years earlier and was cursed with her everlasting life. This seems like a poor curse for a witch to give someone since he hunts witches and he just so happens to be very good at it but whatever. Kaulder's life gets more complicated when some evil witches decide to resurrect the Witch Queen and curse his friend, confidant, and handler Dolan the 36th (Michael Caine). Kaulder has to team up with a young witch named Chloe (Rose Leslie) and his new handler Dolan the 37th (Elijah Wood) to save his buddy and the entire world from the ridiculously evil Witch Queen.I'm honestly not really impressed with Vin Diesel's acting abilities but I believe he does a decent job in this film. He plays the usual tough, macho type of guy that doesn't emote much but he does portray a bit more compassion than usual. He really doesn't kill that many people in the movie and he seems to try to avoid it for the most part. 800 years is a long time so I guess he had plenty of time to cool down on the whole witches killed my family thing. Michael Caine, Rose Leslie, and Elijah Wood all do decent jobs in their roles and they help to make the characters somewhat likable. The biggest problem is that these characters are the same stereotypes that we've been getting in corny action films for what seems like forever. Caine is the wise old man, Leslie is the feisty love interest that is out of her depth, and Wood is the new guy that's willing to help but isn't quite ready yet. The talent is there but the characters just aren't that compelling to begin with.The movie's main drawback is the script. The conversations are awkward and just downright corny. I mean, I'm not expecting Shakespeare from a film about witches and the men that hunt them but I couldn't help cringing at some parts. Bad dialogue is a little hard to explain without specific examples and I really want to avoid spoiling too much of the story. It's bad enough that I felt like I was going to fall asleep at certain parts of the film. That's the first time in five years I almost fell asleep during a film. I feel bad for the actors and actresses because they actually did pretty well with what they were given. There are also some truly ridiculous plot holes that are pretty difficult to explain. Characters' motivations don't even get close to justifying their actions. I was especially scratching my head at the end of the film since nothing whatsoever made sense about the final battle.Fortunately, the movie does have a few things going for it. First off, it's actually a pretty cool looking movie. The Witch Queen's giant foreboding tree castle reminds of something from old Norse myths and there are plenty of noticeable differences between all of the different witches and their abodes. It's nice to see some variety in this kind of film. I also thought that the story has some real potential. The horrible script kept it from reaching that potential but I thought the mythology that the movie built up was interesting and I wouldn't mind a sequel as long as they can get a better script to push the story along.Like I said before, the movie's not good but it's not horrible either. I think some people will like the film and some people will just be bored after a while. I can easily see this one having a lot of different opinions but I myself thought it was entertaining enough that I didn't regret the ticket purchase. Give it a shot if there's nothing else that interests you.",The Last Witch Hunter

It's supposed to be an action drama with spells and witches. And that is executed quite entertaining. The visuals are exceptionally great. The set inside the tree was actually built and lit on fire. The soundtrack by Steve Jablonsky is bold and serves each scene very well. I still don't buy Vin Diesel's smooth voice and the cute look he puts on in the safe house.

110,tyingling7766,The Last Witch Hunter Review,6,24 February 2017,"I don't know what it is about The Last Witch Hunter, but for some reason it was really hard for me to get into this movie. Allow me to explainSynopsis: The modern world holds many secrets, but the most astounding secret of all is that witches still live amongst us; vicious supernatural creatures intent on unleashing the Black Death upon the world. Armies of witch hunters battled the unnatural enemy across the globe for centuries, including Kaulder, a valiant warrior who managed to slay the all-powerful Queen Witch, decimating her followers in the process. In the moments right before her death, the Queen curses Kaulder with her own immortality, forever separating him from his beloved wife and daughter in the afterlife. Today Kaulder is the only one of his kind remaining, and has spent centuries hunting down rogue witches, all the while yearning for his long-lost loved ones. However, unbeknownst to Kaulder, the Queen Witch is resurrected and seeks revenge on her killer causing an epic battle that will determine the survival of the human race. Starring: Vin Diesel, Rose Leslie, Elijah Wood Director: Breck EisnerFirst thing, let's start with a good thing. The story is, in my opinion, an exceptional story. An immortal man is only living to rid the world of witches and warlocks. Who wouldn't like a storyline like that? Yes, it is a fantasy movie with elements of horror and action and comedy, but it is still a good story.I don't know about the setting, but it worked in the favor of the movie. NYC is the hub for commerce in the entire world. So why wouldn't the witches and warlocks base all their operations out of the biggest hub in the world? It would have been nice to see someplace a bit smaller for this setting, but I can understand.As for the acting, it just seemed like most of the actors phoned their roles in. The only exception to this is Rose Leslie. I've never seen her in a movie before, but she owned her role as Chloe. The worse one of the main cast was Elijah Wood. He didn't play the part in the right way it seemed like. You could something was up from the second he came into the movie.Now, I like Vin Diesel movies, and this was one of his movies. It was made completely around him. I don't think this movie would have been made (even though it should have) without him in the lead role. Although, he did seem out of place in the movie.If you have about an hour and forty minutes to kill, you can give this movie a gander. But don't go out of your way to do so. It's not a bad movie, it's just not a must see either.Rating: 6 out of 10",The Last Witch Hunter

And the first ten minutes did confirm the bad reviews I read beforehand. But starting when Vin Diesel investigated his friends' office, the pacing of the movie got very enjoyable.I didn't think much about the lack of originality or the mishmash thrown around the entire festive (as other reviewers pointed out), it was designed to collaborate anyway. I enjoyed the casts very much, especially Rose Leslie as the good witch. Been fangirl-ing her since the GoT series. Despite the awkward chemistry between her and Vin -- honestly Vin looked like a pervert bodyguard during the ""I-heart-you"" scene -- the duo played professionally well.So... if you're interested to see this movie, just lower your expectation, and enjoy the ride.If you go in a cinema just to nitpick, what a waste of money.

OK, Vin Diesel's character is cursed to live forever. From here, the rest of the film goes from interesting, to boring, to stupid, to out right ridiculous. Seriously the screen writers need to go to school to learn how to write a story with a common sense plot. The 'action' is laughable. There wasn't enough action to overlook the glarying plot inconsistencies. The whole plot w was ridiculous. For a movie ab out magic, there was not much magic. The big bad warlock is killed by a simple knife throw, really? The characterization of Vin Diesel's character was all wrong, he is supposed to be 800 years old, the curse was so he would be miserable, but instead he's happy go lucky, having one night stands.

All I know is this movie stars the great Vin Diesel, about witches and an seemingly awful trailer. Yeah, it's a sign for a bad movie.But the movie eventually delivers a fun ride that no one would ever expect, thanks to the spoiler-free trailer (which also awfully bad at the same time). Vin Diesel's performance was incredible, like his Fast and Furious persona. Michael Caine's acting was also still awesome as always. The film also has twists, something that I couldn't imagine before. Overall a good experience by the wayAlthough with solid performance and a fun story. The film still has several mistakes. The storyline itself was confusing (in my opinion) so it's no surprise that people may not understand the story at first glance. The CGI still can be spotted easily, but several CGI involved scenes were spectacular. The plague in form of million of bees(?) were jaw breaking. The lack of humour in this movie, in my opinion, for me makes this movie not really enjoyable. The film also has several plot holes (once again, it's in my opinion, everyone's view to this movie are different)But overall, this movie is a fun ride to be watch.

All it was was just green screen filled, cartoon looking, silly acted crap with cliché horror and action movie tropes. What a disappointment, what a waste of my money and time. I'm giving Vin Diesel and Michael Caine props however with 3 stars for their chemistry that they were able to bring in a movie that clearly wanted to waste the talents of every cast member with each of their undeveloped characters.They even made Elijah Wood bad in this movie. I'm not saying that he is a bad actor, but he gave a pretty bad performance in this movie. I wouldn't exactly say that this movie is the worst thing I've ever seen, but at the same time, I'm not going to suggest watching this movie again to myself.Anyone else I'm sure could probably get stoned or get drunk and still have a great time with The Last Witch Hunter, but I am neither a alcoholic or a stoner and hope I never have to be, and so therefore I didn't enjoy this movie a lot.3/10",The Last Witch Hunter
119,malcydon,"Very good, enjoyable, action filled",10,22 May 2017,"The movie was very good, I really enjoyed it. The actors were great, the plot was good, the magic and witches refreshed - more in the buff and chant, less in the glass cannon idea.The main reason I write this review, because of other negative reviews. I do not think that the reviews mirror the reality. So please let me debunk that.The CGI is good, not over-excellent, over the top.. it's CGI. Very good looking, at some places a bit lacking but well edited when it comes to action and chanting. The story is good. Makes the mood, gives you empathy, let's you feel through of it.. yet it goes well with nowadays. Of course it's a 2 hour movie, don't expect world-end, but it has a lot. The world building is also great. We can see the world of witches, the world of man, the collision, the mix. At some places there are moments that make you think, why they do that, how that comes together.. at some other places you see war-thorn witches, very old.. which are just hints as in how did that happen? Would they be black magic users, they would be in prison forever. So it does have that. The characters have development, they work well together. The script is well done, it has seriousness, thoughts, funny moments - ""Let me see you do that with an iPad."" Very good. The actors.. now.. here a lot of people didn't like things. Vin Diesel plays more of the father type in his 50ies, of course without family, which play out very well. Michael Caine does a very good job, you can feel the chemistry but the gap between the worlds. It's a bit distracting, but also good, because it is also written as such. Caine is an old man, probably 60-80ies, typical old British gentleman who lived over his life, adventures, strife, etc. Which clashes with Vin-s character, since he cannot find peace or happiness. Very good. Than comes other characters - no spoilers - they do a very good job. I really liked how both the side characters had their own side feelings, they weren't cast-ed as how they look, but as what they lived. It's a surprise. Really liked Rose-s playfulness, good movements, body language. Elijah did excellent. He will surprise you too - again no spoiler - with his strong standing up and hardened stature.I don't really have more to say. It's very well done, and I really enjoyed it.

I am a DM in dungeon & dragon and I could totally see this as a great campaign. The only problem the movie really has is that to translate what I see as the ideal behind it is hard to fit on screen because of time and money.

Even supersedes my expectations. The visual effects and the feeling of being plunged into a dark world matches Constantine. The acting is good - Michael Caine and Rose Leslie are really great in their roles. All the main characters are engaging and believable in the context of the movie. Even the baddies have souls to feel through the screen. I would like to see sequels of this. The witch-world really caught me.Some flaws exist that annoyed me. I try to just ignore them and not be the negative guy, but it was hard this time:Who decided the title ""The Last Witchhunter"". Last how? Was there any other ever? ""The Witchhunter"" would sound better and match the movie content.The witch magic was very diverse and immensely powerful. Yet all witches were afraid of the one Witchhunter and failed to beat him. They could drag people to different dimensions, trap them in eternal mind-dreams, throw them around like leaves etc. But the Vin Diesel character was just too cool maybe? He always beat them with fists, a sword or a thrown dagger. What's wrong with some firearms? If non-magical blades worked, some rifles would be a better bet if the fate of the world was at stake. Not cool enough I guess. I truly hate it when the hero fights for his life and needs to save the world, but when he has won and just need to finish of the enemy, he needs to pause, say some cool one-liners, spin around the sword or make an absolutely ridiculous finishing-attack - like a wrestler making a flip from the top-rope.But I loved the movie.",The Last Witch Hunter
126,mlaimlai2,"While Vin Diesel is hunting for witches, you might be hunting for some sense",4,15 November 2015,"If Vin Diesel is planning to star in another franchise after the successes of The Fast and the Furious and Riddick, he has another think coming. There is a fair bit of action that makes use of Diesel's physical presence but the movie is bogged down in expository dialogue and a story that is incomprehensible at times. It also doesn't help when the majority of the film is set at night with quite a few of the action scenes being difficult to see.Kaulder (Vin Diesel) is an 800 year old warrior whose main goal in life is to rid the world of witches. Just before he succeeds in eliminating the Witch Queen (Julie Engelbrecht), she curses him with immortality. We next see him in present day where he is still fighting the evil forces, this time with a priest bestowed with the title of Dolan 36th (Michael Caine). Realising that he can't continue forever unlike his immortal friend, Dolan 36th introduces Kaulder to another priest in Dolan 37th (Elijah Wood) who will take over the reigns as Kaulder's sidekick. Joining them is a good witch named Chloe (Rose Leslie), otherwise known as a dream walker.Vin Diesel has a limited acting range but makes use of it in this type of role where he is the action hero although he's not as convincing as he is in the Fast and the Furious series. That's probably because the wisecracks are funnier and the character of Dominic Toretto is more fleshed out. Two time Oscar winner Michael Caine has a small role and is in a coma for most of the film. He once said of his Jaws 4: The Revenge role that the house that Jaws built was terrific so the role of Dolan 37th must have financed his holidays. Elijah Wood displays his dramatic abilities and is involved in a twist which is preposterous. The editing is fast and furious at times which makes it difficult to focus on what's happening in the action sequences. They seem to be well-choreographed with the exemplary sound effects bringing the fight scenes to life. Most of the visual effects are of the CGI variety and make a solid contribution to the look of the film. No matter how successful or unsuccessful a film is with the technological side of things, if the story is inferior like it is in this film, the overall impact suffers. There is a lack of tension for this particular genre and if you can remember the majority of the film after seeing it, you're doing much better than I am.The Last Witch Hunter is a forgettable movie that has better action sequences than plot lines and dialogue. Vin Diesel has shown in the past that he can carry a movie, just not this one. The box office reception suggests that he should stick to the Fast and the Furious franchise. http://mlaimlai2.wix.com/magical-movie-review",The Last Witch Hunter
127,thefilmlawyers,The best movie you'll ever hate,5,4 November 2015,"The Last Witch Hunter was not received well by most critics. The poor soul of a medium did not even make it to the proverbial slaughterhouse before reviewers butchered the very essence of its existence. But, despite what my name may imply, you have to try a little hard to get me to hate a movie, even a bad one. And compared to some movies that I do in fact despise to the core, Vin Diesel the movie is not all that bad.​First I'll point out some of the things that I didn't hate. I did not mind the excessive CGI, I did not think it was distracting. I did not mind the mediocre plot too much. And the acting did not make me want to poke my eyes out in an Oedipus-like fashion (spoiler alert for those who haven't heard this ancient story).Now, to address the title of this edition. If all you care about is a good story, top notch acting (which the movie did more or less have), and reasonable computer effects, then don't watch the movie. But if you prefer to look past those things and look for subtleties in the story and themes, then look no further. There is one thing that kept me, personally, engaged in the story: the concept of immortality and bipolar power dynamics.As the trailer for the film indicates, Kaulder (Diesel) was cursed with immortality by a witch queen presumably as a punishment for killing her. But what kind of punishment is immortality? How is living forever supposed to suck for Kaulder? Now some might refer to the extensive record of ""immortality based"" plots of other movies, TV shows, novels etc., to answer the question. Loneliness, the burden of fighting evil and never getting a rest, constantly having to worry about being exposed, and, probably worst of all, constantly dying mortal loved ones and friends, forcing the protagonist to refrain from forming attachments (which adds to the loneliness); these are all examples that pop to mind. They are probably overused plot devices and are not the only ones used to add substance to the plot of the movie. There is the female supporting character who betrays her witch friends to fight with the good guys (also indicated by the trailer). And there is the Inception-Matrix-esque cliché of the ""if you die in there you die in the real world"" nature. Nope, the movie screams no originality.But there is one more reason for the immortality which had me thinking. (The actual reason is explained in the movie, which I won't spoil). If you've seen other movies, such as The Wolverine (2013), the immortal protagonist is sometimes given a way out. It is perceived as freedom from some kind of prison. And a pattern is followed. The protagonist becomes mortal for a short while, realizes that it is crucial for him (or her) to remain immortal, and ex-machina his way back to immortality. Why the need for immortality? Because there is always going to be evil lurking in the unknown. Defeat one evil and something worse will come afterward. So there needs to be something to prevent the worst from happening, to freeze the transit of evil. And the best way to do it is by Cold Warring the heck out of the problem. Applying the Ying and Yang. No God and Satan? (the movie doesn't touch on that topic). No problem! All you need is a long lasting, incorruptible good guy, (who is nonetheless vulnerable in his own way, and therefore, exploitable) and a manageable evil whose sole existence is to prevent the worst from replacing it. Of course, I'm not saying that there were a good and a bad guy during the Cold War, but the threat of nuclear destruction is what prevented nuclear destruction (and other things too, please don't grill me). I have a feeling that what might replace the witches will not care very much for them. So the bad guys have something to gain from it too (maybe, not sure).And I think the movie did a pretty good job at relaying the theme to the audience. It teased the pseudo-plot twist in a decent way. I refrained from thinking about its predictability and decided to focus on the effort to hint at the climax. Significant attention was given for the necessity for the dream world. The lead up to the final fight (which I must admit was underwhelming), did have me thinking about the importance of power in maintaining order. Our enemies are what give us and take away the drive to defeat them.Maybe I liked the movie because I don't watch too many like it, so I haven't gotten sick of the repetitiveness. Some claim that there wasn't much witch hunting in the movie, leading them to conclude that it was confused about what it wanted to be. But that appeals to me somehow. It's like an expensive, well filmed, mid-life crisis. Flawed, vulnerable, much like the characters, with unreached potential. I must say, I appreciate bad movies.The Last Witch Hunter ultimately falls apart and only musters a DFind our other reviews at http://thefilmlawyers.wordpress.com",The Last Witch Hunter

129,nesskimo,When can we get a second helping of the witch hunter? 😃,8,31 October 2019,"I thoroughly enjoy this film every time I watch it. The set design is absolutely beautiful, visually stunning and in many ways inviting; who wouldn't want to hang out in the Witch bar? The story and characters make it a joy to watch. I only hope we're not kept waiting for the sequel!",The Last Witch Hunter
130,starman-wa,Not what I expected...,6,26 August 2020,"If you watch the trailers you would be forgiven if you thought this would be set in medieval times, somewhat like a Van Helsing style romp...but...it's not.It alternates between medieval times and present day, and does those transitions well, mostly as flashbacks so most is set in modern times.Vin Diesel is serviceable in a role that is not all out action, Michael Cain plays a cameo and Rose Leslie also is really just a support role but plays it well enough.I found the action scenes from medieval times not very well done, they were fast action and short clips that didn't quite work, I also found the Queen's (Julie Engelbrecht) costume/makeup very unconvincing.Worth the watch but don't expect too much",The Last Witch Hunter
131,Old_Man_From_Scene_24,"Diesel fans will enjoy, but not many others",6,21 October 2015,"I've given this movie half its maximum rating because I see it for what it is - mindless action told as a rollicking adventure that is not meant to be taken seriously. The one-liners are proof of this. Vin Diesel is Vin Diesel, and does what he does best - growls into the camera, adapts an imposing countenance, and unleashes action- based fury upon those who dare defy his majestic bald persona. But in all seriousness, I'm just a bit of a fan, and I've never thought his stand-out movies (the Riddick and FF series) have been amazing. I enjoyed Pitch Black and Riddick, but none of the others in either franchise. So I went into the cinema to watch this movie with not an air of trepidation, but a feeling that I knew what to expect - something that's mindless fantasy action and which will not be remembered a year from today. That's exactly what I got, and so my expectations weren't raised enough to be dashed. What you see is what you get. I enjoyed the spectacle, even if I think the visuals could have been handled a little better. I thought Diesel was entertaining, even if his dialogue wasn't unique to the role. And I thought the plot was familiar and basic, yet not overtly terrible. It was watchable, and in a movie like this, that's about all one can hope for. The supporting cast weren't helped by some poorly-written and flatly-delivered lines, but Michael Caine did what he could, Rose Leslie will either be loved or hated based on the viewer's discretion, and Elijah Wood seemed a little miscast to my eyes. But like the plot, the acting isn't what we focus on. If it were, Vin Diesel would not have the hardcore fans he does, because we all know what type of character he's suited to, and Kaulder is it, just like Riddick. Viewers don't WANT Vin Diesel to be someone given subtle, sensitive or even smart dialogue, because he's just so enjoyable beating people to death that you find yourself throwing your arms up, laughing and saying, ""to hell with dialogue"". One more thing I'll say is that the run-time for this movie is about right, even if the build-up is a little slow. Any longer and I would have lowered this rating to 3 or 4, simply because the tension to action ratio is already about 70:30, and any less than that would have been a huge issue. After Sicario last week, it would have really annoyed me to suffer through such tediousness again. At least The Last Witch Hunter is entertaining. If you're a Vin Diesel/action/fantasy/Gothic fan who doesn't care about substance, go see it. If not... maybe don't.",The Last Witch Hunter

A movie that feels totally incomplete? A movie where the lazily crafted scenes slowly kill your brain cells? Well then, welcome to The Last Witch Hunter!I watched the trailer, I knew the plot and I also knew what this movie was going to be. A bad-ass Vin Diesel kicking all kinds of demon/witch behinds with a thin plot. I was a hopeful idiot. This movie actually managed to fall beneath my already low expectations. It starts off with exposition about Colder, Diesel's supposedly sullen but expert Witch Hunter. After a guest appearance from Michael Caine (another butler-ish role), it veers into the typical Hero vs Evil story-line, interwoven with magic, creatures and exposition via dialogue – lot's of useless dialogue... ... ...Continue reading the review at my blog:https://microreels.wordpress.com/2015/10/23/the-last-witch-hunter- film-review/",The Last Witch Hunter
134,cokezero99,Very boring,2,14 February 2016,"This film is seriously dull.Whenever a fantasy film or game is made with it's own internal mythos it MUST be interesting because every character, plot, etc. is set in this mythos and it is where you immerse yourself for a few hours. The mythos of this film... is so bland and generic that you just do not care.Lately there have been a lot of similar films (Priest, Hanzel & Gretyl, Van Helsing, Hellboy, Underworld) that all share some similarities (one hero against an attempt of a villain to rise up and mess the world up). While this in itself can be dull if you see it in film after film these films I mentioned are NOT (in my opinion) dull because the mythos of the film is very interesting. It's engrossing. You care. After watching you may imagine living in that world. Not here its just so not fleshed out, nothing is fully explained, it's like they know their world is so generic that you'll be filling in the massive mythos gaps as you go.The acting is generic, the storyline is meh, the one plot twist is introduced and concluded and forgotten in about 2 minutes if that, and... ya, sorry just skip. Even if you're a Vin Diesel fan just don't bother go watch Riddick again or something.2/10 - 1 just for Vin Diesel and another 1 because the visuals were pretty nice at times.",The Last Witch Hunter
135,Blackspecter,Not so much about the movie itself,9,17 January 2016,"I don't usually write these, but I thought I should give it a go this time. Firstly I really liked it, no more explanation I just did. What I think many critics these days looks at in a film is that it has a message, if it doesn't it's crap. This film don't much have one, well maybe don't be bad. Personally when I watch a movie I tend to do it to have a good time and get away from the mundane everyday life. If I want a deep message I watch the news or a documentary, or a movie that has one. Anyway what I don't get about the movie industry today is that this movie is considered a failure, or something like that, and it made about 20% more than it cost in less than 3 months. How the hell can anyone see that as a failure is beyond me. And it hasn't had it's premiere in China yet, not sure if this is their kind of movie though, and they have about 20% of the worlds population. I think it will earn a little more money than it has when all the premieres have been showed. I think I remembered about the same that is said about Pitch Black when it came, it took a couple of years till that changed I hope it will be the same with this.",The Last Witch Hunter

Game of Thrones star plays the character Chloe(Dream walker), teams up with Vin Diesel & Elijah Wood to defeat the Queen Witch.-Does Michael Caine has extended role? No, Dolan-36 just hand over his responsibility to his son Dolan-37 in few mins. His presence seems to be special appearance.-Last question about Vin Diesel? Kaulder in this modern world, from centuries ago. 48yrs old lead actor from Fast & Furious franchise is always good at action.

The colors, hues, and the visual effects were gorgeous. I also loved the mysteriousness of the film.Plus the depth of witchcraft information that was included in it. It made the film believable. I love how Vin Diesel was able to play different characters than the usual ones that he is cast for. It was interesting to see him in costumes of various worlds and time periods. It had beautiful images in it that looked like they would be difficult to create but at the same time they were beautiful. The action scenes were fun and Vin Diesel looked very stylish in his coats. Gorgeous man in a gorgeous film. Regardless if you like witch stories or not you have to see this film for the richness in colors and special effects. I'm so glad I got to see this movie one of the funner movies I've seen all this year.

140,aldoo-lim,love it,10,14 January 2016,"I decided to watch this movie without knowing anything about it. Just the title and a tiny thumbnail. That is, from the title and thumbnail, I thought this was a low budget medieval-knight-hero-villain kind of movie since I do enjoy such movies once in a while. I find them charming. a few minutes in, I really thought that I was watching a low budget film but I remembered thinking, the supposed lead really looks like vin diesel - wow the animation and CG is pretty awesome for this kind of films, guess the time has changed... hmm why does the lead looks like a viking instead of a medieval knight - well its expected from this movies anyway.Then I popped up to IMDb and only then I realized that it is vin diesel (this was before the airplane scene). I suppose A list actors enjoy doing whacky ""low budget"" films once in a blue moon as I enjoy watching them (not saying this is low budget, it just appears so, be it scenes, scripts storyline or the costumes)",The Last Witch Hunter
141,ritonobono,At least it had some big names,2,26 October 2015,"The Last Witch Hunter really left a lot to be desired. It's a typical last of your kind story. Vin Diesel stars as that said last of his kind. Oh, and he's immortal by the way. Something about killing the witch queen. I'm not really a big fan of Vin Diesel, but even to those who are I'd just avoid this. I mean Vin himself does what he can, but honestly the guy couldn't act to save his life. Though he's far from the worst of it.The biggest shocker was Elijah Wood. I mean, seriously? The guy doesn't really give a convincing performance. I mean he's had his fair share of bad movies (ex. North, All I Want, Spy Kids 3-D (etc.)), but his performance in the movie made it almost seem like he was desperate, knowing he could in no way save the movie, but felt he had to make a conscious effort to do so. The problem with his character being the bad guy is that the movie hints so many times he's the bad guy and he at one point is even questioned and denies it. This wouldn't be such a problem if they didn't make it so painfully obvious he's in cahoots with the Queen. Like I said, I love the Lord of the Rings movies as much as the next guy, but he's had better movies.The rest of the cast doesn't leave much of an impression, but we do have Michael Caine as the guy who was cursed. He's bland, but what can you expect? As for the story it's more confusing than interesting. Most of the logic seems to be set aside for glimpses of CGI effects which are only average at best and the editing during these scenes is too jumpy. Can't seem to stay on one thing too long eh? And for a movie all about action there doesn't seem to be very much of it. It seems like 70% of the movie is philosophy BS and 30% is actual action. So there you have it, a 106 minute winded philosophical mess. It probably would've been better off as a TV series or a short film, but as a movie it wears out it's welcome far too quickly.",The Last Witch Hunter

144,gabe-09926,"Ok film, nothing spectacular or great but decent entertainment",4,13 September 2019,"Do you ever wonder why you enjoyed movie more in the theatre than when you bought it on blu ray it home? We all know films are more exciting and exhilirating when watching them in the theatre (i.e. more immersive). The simple answer of course as to why our viewing experiences are better in theatres than at home has to do with the limitations of our media to view it at home (TV's, blu ray playes, home theatre systems, etc.). With the advancements of todays technologies in televisions now days such as high resolution TVs (4k's and beyond), improved media formats (blu ray, 4k UHD) and frame rate manipulation (24P vs 60P) etc., among many other features, this has brought us closer than we've ever been to being able to match theatre qualities that ultimately give us that same immersive experience. Unfortunately some new features of todays tech can actually hurt the viewing experience as well. Your setup is going to be vital to how you experience a film and ultimately what you thougt of it. You may be telling yourself ""well duh, everyone knows that, so whats your point?"" The point I'm trying to make is that not everyone knows this and may have an improper setup when writing a reviews on a film. This is especially concerning to me when I see reviews suggesting films were ""bad,"" ""outdated,"" or ""what were they thinking, people actually thought this was good."" Case in point, PLEASE, make sure you have the proper settings when viewing films before making a review on it as it can most certainly effect what you thought of it.I am a film lover and nothing brings me more satisfaction than to see others experience that same level joy as I do. Conversely, nothing upsets me more than to see a good film get torn to shreds due to an inadequate setup. So instead of giving you my 2 cent review of a film, since there are so many good reviewers out there already, I will simply rate the film and state whether I thought it was good, bad, ok or excellent and tell you how I watched it. Obviously settings are subjectable to each setup and individual perspective and I am in no way shape or form suggesting that my way is the only correct way but rather this is how I enjoyed it and you might like it that way too.",The Last Witch Hunter

I figured it had to have some merit with the likes of Michael Cain, Elijah Wood, and Rose Leslie.I must say the movie held my attention, and I was pleasantly surprised by the overall plot. Vin Diesel wasn't horrible, but he wasn't all that great either. I would love to see this film with a different protagonist like a Viggo Mortensen or David Tennant.

Honestly, I watched it because of the cast, headed by Vin Diesel, who was surprisingly sympathetic, and Elijah Wood (Frodo Forever!). Michael Caine also plays a small but key role and adds just enough tongue-in-cheek gravitas to elevate the movie. The story isn't new or brilliant, but it is fun as far as supernatural good versus evil goes.

It's another one of those Hollywood cliché filled movies. Don't expect much of a storyline other than bad things happened to my family, I became a witch hunter, defied death and killed witches. It's just filled with moments you know exactly how they're going to turn out if you've seen any other movie from Hollywood. The visual effects were good enough. And the actors played their role. The plot has so much potential. Something like knights of the round table dedicated to incarcerating witches for using black magic.

Also I feel the graphics were beautiful without being too light hearted for a movie about witches.

159,beneke200,"Typical and cliché, bad characterbuilding, no tension and predictable",4,28 September 2019,"To start, the idea is actually pretty cool... So was the intro. The world building seems pretty awesome, too. They establish some rules which kind of make sense. The main character being known to the world and not having any worries as he is immortal, was handled well. There's also a nice ""no-nonsense"" vibe about the main character which fits having lived for 800 years. The effects were pretty cool, too! However, this does not weigh up against the big list of negatives;There is absolutely no tension whatsoever. Every matter is resolved within no time, decisions are made within literal seconds and any issues that arise from it are resolved in similar fashion.The characters jump from point A to B like snapping your fingers. They have 0 characterbuilding and 0 independence. They are being moved by the plot and sometimes they just make decisions without the plot even demanding it as if it's jammed down your throat. It makes no sense.Vin Diesel was really good in the non-fighting scenes, but he just couldn't pull off the action-hero. Honestly, he just could not carry this movie and I'd say he's been misscast as the main character.The relationship between Chloe and Kaulder was also extremely rushed. It makes absolutely no sense how quickly they were in it together and how much they cared for each other in a matter of what... hours? Again, coming back to the snap decisions and absolutely no building of characters or tension.This movie could have been so much more. The intro makes it seem like such a serious movie but that just adds to the negative surprise when watching further.In my opinion, just watch the intro. Maybe another 20-30 minutes for some world-building if you want. Now imagine the rest of the movie and I guarantee it'll be better than what they did with it.",The Last Witch Hunter

In this case, they came up with the plot of Ghostbusters + Frodo Baggins + ""In a world where witches live everywhere in secret"" + Vin Diesel... playing... Vin Diesel.A lot of the other reviews seem to want to say this move was bad, but super entertaining. That's actually what I expected when I convinced 12 of my coworkers to go see the film with me. What I got was indeed bad, but also dumb, and boring. The plot was exactly taken from Ghostbusters. There are witches everywhere, some good, some bad, the main characters round up the bad ones and lock them in a central place in New York City, until a big bad one comes along and frees them all. The difference was, none of the anti-witch team was even a little bit likable. And no, its not enough for Vin Diesel to just walk around and mutter choppy, poor dialog for me anymore, it just isn't. I think he could be so much better. The action was just a big let down. So the witch queen can generate 100,000 wasps in a swarm and send them at you? How could he counter that? Oh, just walk up and stab her with a sword. Wow, amazing. I just didn't see any creativity. Characters got in and out of trouble at will with no explanation. Giant bone witch crypt keeper comes thrashing along at you? Just jump in the air toward it, and it explodes. Oh shoot it with a little gun. That'll do. Lame. Hot girl gets sucked into some subterranean witch-hell, never to return? A hand reaches in, from who knows where, pulls her out, and she ends up in bed. Problem solved. Thanks.And there was so much downtime with just bad dialog. There was no reason the good witch would come around to his side and commit to him for life, she just sort of did.

Some of the best movies ever made had simple plots. and to me that is a silly argument.I will just list my positives.1. It was filmed beautifully. The colors, cinematography, costumes, and even the special effects were fantastic.2. The dialogue was simple but not campy. It even made me laugh out loud 3 times.3. The acting was good. Vin stood out.Honestly it had everything I wanted in a fantasy movie. My only gripe would be I would liked to have seen him have maybe two more kick ass action scenes.Really, give this one a shot.",The Last Witch Hunter

Excellent visual effects, solid acting( Michael Caine is in it so solid acting goes without saying but still) , average plot and very acceptable runtime, on the bad side i must say that Vin Diesel look little old for this kind of action movie, but he still manage to deliver the (badass) character.

It was nice to see Rose Leslie from Game of Thrones, first time seeing her in anything else.

He always give his best in this kind of ""badass"" character (Riddick, Fast and Furious).If I had to point out something not good about this movie I would say that is too stereotyped, especially in the end, but, in the end, I think it's worth spending 10$ to see it!",The Last Witch Hunter

Vin D. is a WRONG cast that makes the whole thing ruined. It is a character of a super experienced old human and yet he still play as his other characters of his previous movies, especially that stupid smile like he was in Fast n Furious (I can't bare when he said to Michael Cain ""Hey Kid!"").Imagine if this witch hunter is played by Keanu Reeves, that ""Constantine X John Wick"" Keanu Reeves, this franchise will become successful.",The Last Witch Hunter

173,robinhfan,Not bad for the genre,7,15 June 2016,Thought movie was more fantasy than action and I enjoyed the lore and magic. Plot was good and much less predictable than many other action movies. Although there were some loose-ends - small hints of plot that were left unaddressed. The struggle of 'good and evil' was presented in an interesting way and not completely black and white. Acting could have been more convincing and wish Michael Caine had more of a role. Certain parts of the story and script could have been flushed out more especially the motivations and backgrounds of the supporting characters. Overall worth a watch if interested in fantasy especially considering there's not many recent movies in this genre.,The Last Witch Hunter

Most of what i see, in the realm of non indie or non blockbuster, the Halloween or summer movies realm, is the same formula, and while TLWH relies on a old one, still manages to safe a few surprises in the plot, that i didn't expect, and there's what makes this a better entertainment than the others holidays films.It's a movie where you can sit, watch, get some popcorn with your friends, and enjoy one nice evening on home or cinema. The acting is not the best from the actors, Michael Caine and Diesel are what the movies needs, and is where lies the goal of this flick, is not the best, but do what propose to, be a good time, there's nothing else we can complain about it, a good time movie is way better than a boring ultra deep, 3-hour, intellectual film that goes nowhere, and is easy to say that the enjoyable is worse than the art for the sake of art.In the end of TLWH i was very satisfied, i wont remember forever, it wont won a Oscar, but the times i'm home ate Friday night with some friends, probably this will be in the list of movies that i mighty see, so don't mind the reviews, if you like some time without a urge to be smart and cool, grab a snack, see this film and enjoy what the entertainment world has to offer, entertainment.",The Last Witch Hunter

And you know what? Shame on your critics. Based on the reviews I read and then the movie I watched I think it's fair to say you critics were expecting a ""Fast and the Furious witch hunter"" and instead you got a movie that was neither fast nor furious. Instead it was a story. A story that I thought was entertaining and fun to watch. A witch story similar to others in global concept but delivered in a refreshing way. A story that I will watch again.

In a bar at 3am written by the bartender who couldn't stand on his feet anymore. The plot twists were like ""oh here we go again"". Vin Diesel. I didn't like his performance. Caine was great. Leslie too. There was some good cgi. Some of it was good. Not all.I gave it a 3 for effort. I watched this with my girlfriend and she hated it with a passion. She just wanted to see it because of GoT. I thought well it has Vin Diesel so it will be some nice action.

This movie is rated PG-13 for sequence of fantasy violence and frightening images. The last witch hunter was released on October 23rd 2015. it was 1 hour and 46 minutes. The people rated this movie 6 out of 10 stars. I rated it 9 out of 10 stars. If you like movies that have action, adventure, and fantasy you should watch this movie.

183,Hydroo,"Terrible ""film"".",1,24 October 2015,"The Last Witch Hunter looks like a pointless mix of ""Blade"" (very cool), ""Hellboy"" (very very cool), ""The Highlander"" (classic), ""Constantine"" (very good), ""The Priest"" (worse), ""Max Payne"" (worst) and the other Gothic-, horror- and fantasy-like movies. The main problem is that the authors put some boring CGI in every scene for no reason. The second is the cast: it is hard to imagine Vin Diesel in the role of a 800-year old immortal hunter. To be honest: the start is hopeful (thanks to the ""13th warrior""...). In the intense first scene he's wearing some badass hair, beard and costume, but in the rest of the movie he is more looking like some Armani-model from a fashion show. He is talking, walking and acting like Dom Toretto. Which means his suffering is unbelievable too. Despite I think Vin is a likable actor and I've really liked him as Riddick. But this character just isn't his type. The others - the young witch, the old witch, the young priest, the old priest - and the whole imaginary world are totally sketchy. Even if they've tried to copy a lot of computer games (for example The last of Us) the result is awful. Very colorful and nice-looking, but empty. And finally: the writers and the script. There is no need for words... The only good thing about the film is Michael Caine: he is funny and good as always. I have a question to the director (the guy who directed the impressive The crazies) Breck Eisner: Why did you do this and why?! You're not Uwe Boll, so stop doing this! No offense. ;)",The Last Witch Hunter

What is with all that screaming and screeching? Michael Caine was OK if you take amount of time he was on screen in consideration.This kind of movies can't surprise you. You know when the trouble is coming and pretty sure what will be in next scene.

This movie made it seem like all of these things actually existed with its realism. I really liked the casting as well. Vin Diesel is always great, and Rose Leslie did a wonderful job. The storyline was really easy to fall and get lost in it. I'm hungry for more, and anxious to see more from this great duo.

The combination should have been an interesting team-up movie of A-List actors, but through some dark magic it got turned into an Unexpected Journey (yes I know Elijah didn't play a big role in it, but neither did he in this one) completely lacking anything remotely Fast or Furious.Vin Diesel has proved himself to be a quality actor, yet with this movie he also proves that anyone can follow in the footsteps of Nicholas Cage. There is honestly not much else to say.

Vin Diesel couldn't save this movie even if he tried. We got some big actors, but they couldn't have done anything to make this film interesting either. The battle scenes were boring. The storyline was generic. The movie is just terrible. Kaulder is a witch-hunter cursed with immortality by the Witch Queen. They couldn't even come up with a more cool name for the queen? When Kaulder and the Witch Queen met again, she took back her curse of immortality. In the end, when Kaulder killed the Witch Queen again, a witch friend of his stopped him from destroying the heart because he would die. WHY WOULD HE DIE? The Witch Queen didn't cast the curse of immortality on him for the second time. Destroying the heart wouldn't have killed him at all, so what the heck?

Guys at post production worked hard and a lot on the visual effects. There are a lot of them , but they're really detailed and smooth. Sometimes so tiny... I adored the visuals.In my opinion the plot is quite predictable, but the director managed to make it interesting, fast going and bit tricky at the same time. A lot of new day movies are long and drawn, but this... you had no time for blinking.Actor play was fantastic. Never had i thought about Vin Diesel as witch hunter, but he was great.In conclusion it was a good fantastic movie similar to other witch hunting, demon killing movies, tried to be made in new light, with a lot of perfect, amazing visual effects and great actor play.

The acting and casting was excellent. Some parts of the movie felt really similar to The Exorcist II (Boorman), and I appreciated the lucidity and metaphysics embedded in the plot. I felt like the scene changes and juxtaposing modern/mythical images did a good job of sliding the viewer into the otherworldliness of the script. Most of the criticism seemed to revolve around expectations of Vin Diesels performance. The Character is written tersely for a reason. Why do people expect someone to be Shakespeare, simply because they lived 800 years. That experience might make some people very quiet, and I found Vin Diesel's interpretation believable and appropriate. He isn't portrayed as a scholar or wizard: just a good man who happens to be cursed. Frankly, I don't think most of these people would have been happy with a 20 min monologue by Alan Rickman. The movie was a good fantasy/action movie with some clever plot elements and creative representations of traditional magical elements.",The Last Witch Hunter

Now he's a normal human but she is still not powerful enough to kill him with her QUEEN magical powers(however she kills Dolan 37th, his partner as a human within 2 secs.)

It does not rely on excessive violence, cheesy sex scenes, or gratuitous skin to sell tickets.What you get is engaging performances from Diesel, Leslie, Wood, and Caine, a murder mystery, and a compelling fantasy action-drama. The effects and scenes are beautifully created and shot.As fans of the fantasy genre, we loved the sword and sorcery aspects of the movie, blended with mystery, spiritualism, teamwork, and high concept story telling.This is my first Vin Diesel movie. I liked the way he played the character of Kaulder as a man with complex and layered emotions. I expected bravado and machismo, but instead got a man of depth and quality.I cannot say enough good things about the scenes with the Witch Queen, both when she first curses Kaulder with immortality, and at the end during the climactic battle with Kaulder. I really appreciated that the movie villain was not completely evil, but rather had motives that makes it clear why she acts as she does.I am looking forward to seeing it again on BluRay!",The Last Witch Hunter

Another point is that Elijah wood shouldn't of been in this movie, not just did his performance such but since the Lord of the rings trilogy, he's had no success with his acting career. Michael Cain did a good job as always but it seems like they under used the best asset that the film had.

197,maryfehr,Mindless entertainment,5,20 March 2016,"If you have time to kill, you can watch this. But make sure you really have nothing better to do. Things I didn't like: The thing I noticed that could have been done better was that the opening scene should have been done in a dead forested area, not a mountain tundra. Mountain tundras remind me of Superman's stronghold more than a witch's den.and also the relationship between the protagonist and his love interest was stilted.There were more ""of course"" moments than ""aha"" moments. (For instance: Of course, Dolan #37. Of course. Didn't we all see that one coming?)Some of the timing was off. The love interest of the main character could have been introduced way earlier. In fact, for a moment on the plane, I thought that was going to be it...? But then, it turned out to be not.I was uncomfortable with the way ""the church"" was portrayed in the beginning. There could have been more ritual, like some priest throwing holy water around the tree, and having a plethora of them chanting the rite of exorcism. It would have offset the later chanting the witch's minions were doing to get the plague flies going in NY.The movie could have been improved if Vin's character was more gritty, and that there was a hunter after the hunter (someone would have noticed that he hadn't died for a while, right?) or that after all this time there were actually other witch hunters imitating him, although that would then mean they would have to change the title to ""the more real witch hunter""Things I liked The witch's den/tree was incredibly detailed.Kudos to the bad guy. She was awesomely creepy and yucky. The inference that she was possibly an alien came off wonderfully. Her minions were fairly well developed characters, and pretty believable. The girl on the plane not knowing what she was doing was a nice touch too.The disguised crime scene was a nice surprise.There were some original concepts in there (creepy nature gardens and feeding people caterpillars disguised as cupcakes (no, wait, they did that on ""V""), Roots as a transportation system, the necklace that animated the Sentinel, a witch's night club) mixed with the traditional (luring children into the trap with gummie bears aka Hansel and Gretel style, flies pouring out of windows aka The Mummy)",The Last Witch Hunter

Movie does not have any plot. It seems that writer has a very good imagination but he failed to portray it on screen. Movie is very heavy in terms of fantasy and 3d. But whole story is a crap. Vin diesel in a big actor and movie prove his acting. Basically the huge fantasy which was included in fighting scenes with witch has destroyed whole movie. Movie's story was the reason that it became a big flop for Vin Diesel. I really don't understand why some people are giving it 8/10 or even 9/10 ratings.

I felt like Part of the movie, The Texts are Good ans the backup too, Makeup, style just Everything match to my Taste! I Hope for Your understanding, my English is a Bit worse than yours, but After i Read so much negative Things i just felt to tell/write what i think",The Last Witch Hunter
