0,SnoopyStyle,DeHaan is great and Radcliffe is pretty good too,7,2 July 2014,"In 1942 Paterson, NJ Allen Ginsberg (Daniel Radcliffe) is trying to keep the peace between his cold poet father Louis (David Cross) and his unstable mother Naomi (Jennifer Jason Leigh). As a freshman in Columbia University, he befriends outgoing rebel Lucien Carr (Dane DeHaan) in the tradition bound atmosphere. He introduces Allen to his friends William Burroughs (Ben Foster), jealous David Kammerer (Michael C. Hall), and Jack Kerouac (Jack Huston) with his girlfriend Edie Parker (Elizabeth Olsen). They call themselves 'A New Vision' as they break away from the stifling restrictions of the university until it culminates into murder.I'm not in love with John Krokidas' directing efforts. It's missing something. I don't like the attempt to add jazz into the style of the structure. It needs to raise the tension or emotion or something. The guys' murky relationships are a good start. Maybe it needs to show them having more sex. Something is not all there. I can't really pinpoint it.What really works is the performances of Daniel Radcliffe and the brilliant Dane DeHaan. DeHaan is outstanding. Radcliffe has put Harry Potter behind him. I think the film could put more emotional acting on the screen. That again has to do with the directing. Certainly this is better and more coherent than 'On the Road'. It has great performances but a couple of things keep this from being great.",Kill Your Darlings
1,Horst_In_Translation,Allen in Wonderland,6,19 August 2014,"Daniel Racliffe takes up the part of notable poet Allen Ginsberg here, but I'm fairly certain most audience members of the Harry Potter generation will still see the little magician in him for years to come. So is this Radcliffe's big breakthrough movie as an adult. Not really. It's still a decent effort though and from the visual standpoint he's certainly a good choice for the character. Here he is truly interesting and somehow involved (though not directly) with his best friend murdering another man. This murder and everything surrounding it still serves as some kind of inspiration for Ginsberg.We get to know a bit about his parents and a mental home, but this side-plot felt a bit out of place and certainly could have been omitted. Thumbs up, however, for Ben Foster, one of the most talented and unfortunately also most overlooked actors of his generation. I urge you to check out ""The Messenger"". His William S. Burroughs is a very fine performance and he almost steals the movie, a movie which is a bit of a first timer. Writer Austin Bunn hasn't written a film before and director John Krokidas has only done short films earlier in his career.Having watched all Dexter season except the last, it's nice to see Michael C. Hall in a more vulnerable role for once. He does a decent job with his character and the whole homosexuality aspect is acted accurately by him. Also you can see how Ginsberg slowly transforms into Hall's character as the film progresses. He really becomes more useful than desired to the point where he even writes a defense statement for his lover who is already accused of murder at that point. The lover is played by Dane DeHaan who comes off like a psychopath just the way he is.All in all, I can recommend this movie. It has little outstanding strengths, but it makes for a good watch. If you have seen and enjoyed Bertolucci's The Dreamers, you may like this as well. Sometimes it tries to be too extreme like the hanging scene, which wasn't really necessary, but mostly it's crafted nicely.",Kill Your Darlings
2,nogodnomasters,NEW WORDS. NEW RHYTHMS,8,17 October 2018,"This story is a historical drama concerning the life of Allen Ginsberg (Daniel Radcliffe) and his time at Columbia University. The story centers on the events leading up to the murder of David Kammerer (Michael C. Hall) by Lucien Carr (Dane DeHaan) of which we gets glimpses of in the beginning. The film concentrates on the complex relationship of Ginsberg and Carr, from their writing, to sharing of private lives, to their ""New Vision"" their ""rearrangement of the senses"" to their lover relationship.Other characters include Jack Kerouac (Jack Huston) and William Burroughs (Ben Foster). They created an avant-garde culture by rejecting cultural values, and in a way were the anti-Fitzgeralds while being them.Daniel Radcliffe shows us that if you spend enough time in front of a camera, you can one day be an actor. He was excellent in his role, as were the supporting cast. I would have appreciated a more colorful Jack Kerouac.A good historical drama for those who might find interest in the topic.Parental Guide: F-bomb.

3,kosmasp,Dexter vs. Harry Potter vs. Harry Osborn,6,15 August 2014,"I could've used Six Feet under too for Michael C. Hall, but I don't remember his character name from that. Plus Dexter is more and better known. Won't go into Harry Osborn, though people who know their Spiderman will know whom I'm talking about. So what is the meaning of this? A lot of talent at hand, that's what that means. And a lot of talent is what they are portraying.Strangely the what happened to the real people portrayed in this movie as a tag before the credits, is almost more interesting than the movie itself. But while many will know what role Daniel Radcliffe is playing in this, even if they didn't know the poet himself, the movie does have something to say too. Some scenes might feel uncomfortable, but that was intended obviously, by the director and by Radcliffe himself, trying to get rid of a shell",Kill Your Darlings
4,classicsoncall,"""Welcome to the edge of the world!""",8,16 September 2019,"If I had known this film was about some of the original members of the Beat Generation poets, I probably would have picked it up sooner. Oddly, the story never once mentions the word 'Beat' to describe them, instead opting for a term coined by Allen Ginsberg (Daniel Radcliffe) that focused on 'The New Vision'. Somehow, this entire relationship between Ginsberg, William Burroughs (Ben Foster), Jack Kerouac (Jack Huston), and Lucien Carr (Dane DeHaan) occurred well below my radar when I became interested in some of the writings of Kerouac. But that was in the early Seventies, well past the era in which this story took place. If one isn't ready for it, virtually anything by Burroughs and Ginsberg is so outlandish as to be unreadable and incomprehensible. However the story here is amazingly true to the facts of what occurred regarding the death of David Kammerer (Michael C. Hall), though certain critics will disavow Kammerer's homosexuality and being a predatory stalker. For purposes of the film though, a lot of the facts regarding the relationship of these men to each other and how they reacted to David's death is handled extraordinarily well. One slight omission, even though it was mentioned that Kerouac's girlfriend Edie Parker (Elizabeth Olsen) was set to receive an inheritance and decided to use that money to bail out Kerouac who was arrested as an accessory to Kammerer's murder, a stipulation in the will stated that the money wouldn't be released until she was married. They did get married in New York's City Hall, with Kerouac handcuffed to a detective!",Kill Your Darlings
5,lee_eisenberg,"Harry Potter meets ""Six Feet Under"" in a look at rejection of society's mores",8,21 April 2014,"Allen Ginsberg came to the world's attention when his poem ""Howl"" spurred an obscenity trial. Less known is Ginsberg's life before he wrote the poem. John Krokidas's ""Kill Your Darlings"" looks as Ginsberg's college years, where he met the other people who formed the Beat Generation. This group of people rejected society's mores and never missed a chance to do something rebellious.The bulk of the credit should go to Daniel Radcliffe. His role as the poet shows that he is having a very good post-Harry Potter run. Also impressive are ""Six Feet Under"" co-stars Ben Foster and Michael C. Hall as William Burroughs and David Kammerer, respectively. But most importantly, the movie gives us an early look at the people who later influenced the hippie generation. I recommend it.",Kill Your Darlings
6,rmax304823,Allen In Wonderland.,6,2 March 2015,"It's a story of the poet Allen Ginsberg's youth, from a nice Jewish kid in Patterson, New Jersey, to a dropout from Columbia University in 1944. This milieu -- and the neighborhood called North Beach in San Francisco -- produced the Beat Generation or Beatniks. Many of them, the ones we meet in this film, went on to considerable but ephemeral fame -- Jack Kerouac, William Burroughs, and Ginsberg himself, probably best noted for his poem ""Howl."" The title, ""Kill Your Darlings,"" is from William Faulkner who, taken either by a fit of absurdity or maybe drunkenness, advised writers to delete those passages in their manuscripts that they liked best. If you like something, you wind up obsessed and your judgment fails you.I suppose that's the central theme of the film. Ginsberg falls for Lucien Carr and Carr rejects the importunings of his former lover, David Kammerer, and finally brutally murders Kammerer. I can understand Kammerer's obsession with Carr. Not that I understand eros between two men but I do understand obsession. It took me years to discover which major ocean port was in the middle of Czechoslovia.Daniel Radcliffe is Ginsberg and although he has the name of one of the seven sisters he looks like Ginsberg probably looked -- puny with horn-rimmed glasses. I don't know what Lucien Carr looked like but I can believe he was something like Dane DeHaan -- beautiful and effete. Michael C. Hall is Kammerer, who begins as a commanding figure and winds up a shivering supplicant. All the performances are adequate but Hall's may be the best of the lot. Kerouac is a marginal figure, a football hero and athlete who can also read and write. William Burroughs, Ben Foster here, should do a one-man show as a young Harry Truman.The atmosphere is rich, but the story doesn't quite come together, nor did I care much about who loved who. I don't quite know what happened towards the end. The director and editor turned the murder into the climax, understandably. But they rather spoiled it by giving us broad hints in flashbacks before what is supposed to be the full reveal. The shock they were presumably aiming at is diluted by the sometimes misleading adumbrations and by the generally confused sequence of events leading up to it. Besides, David Kammerer, as portrayed, was a ridiculous pain in the ass. And the title doesn't fit. Carr kills Kammerer, true, but Kammerer was no longer Carr's ""darling"". Just the other way round.And I'm guessing at the constant early references to a revolution in literature -- about how things get more and more separated from their center and need to be pulled back by revolutionaries -- is borrowed from Yeats' ""The Second Coming"", the business about the widening gyre, except that everything these guys do, like destroying the classics in the Columbia library and substituting pornography, isn't ""pulling back"" at all. They're not calling the falcon back. They're setting him loose. Literary chaos is slouching towards Bethlehem.Not that the stuff they produced can be easily dismissed. Ginsberg's ""Howl"", Kerouac's ""On the Road,"" and Burroughs' ""Naked Lunch"" are unforgettable. They read poetry in front of jazz combos in North Beach and the Village. Is one permitted to ask about the aspirations of today's generation of college youths? Anyway, Ginsberg held his act together for the rest of his life, finally finding a steady lover. Kerouac became a smelly drunk, and Burroughs a junkie. But while it lasted -- what gusto!",Kill Your Darlings
7,LeonLouisRicci,On the Road (2010)...Now ThisMaybe Someday,6,19 April 2014,"The Beat Generation's Iconic Trio of Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, and William Burroughs are Featured in this Film but Predominantly, for some less than Artistic, Informative and Inconceivable Idea its Focus is Lucien Carr. He is the Turncoat Coward Murderer that, Yes, did Inspire but was Hardly the Driving Influence of the Talented Trio. He was ""good at beginnings"" but that is not the kind of Half-Genius that Bespeaks Legend.So here is Another Failed Attempt to Portray the Beat's Movement and influence made Sellable as a Murder Story with the Protagonists all being Famous.

Then in the Second Half the whole Film Falls Apart into Clichéd Headlines and Well Known Beat Generation Stuff like Sex, Drugs, and Jazz.The Beginning is Sharp and Focused and the Ending is Dull and Murky, Making this another Disappointing, Unclear, Un Inspirational Uttering of Gloss and Glitz that is a Misrepresentation of the Yet to be Excellently Explored Emancipation Proclamation of the Beat Manifesto.",Kill Your Darlings

Daniel Radcliffe and Dane DeHaan portraying Allen Ginsburg and Lucien Carr deliver quite decent performances as we begin to get into the minds of these pioneering spirits of the 'Beat Generation"". Sure, most of it will have been made up - or, certainly, embellished; and it does try to tick every box imaginable on the socio-sexual scale, but it is still worth watching to get some sense of how these two, with William Burroughs and Jack Kerouac set trends (however fanciful and off-the-wall) that can still resonate today.",Kill Your Darlings
9,gradyharp,'The New Vision': The Beginnings of the Beat Generation,9,5 April 2014,"Director and co-writer (with Austin Bunn) John Krokidas have created an atmospheric visit to the beginnings of one of literary history's great movements – the Beat Generation – and in doing so have carved a fine story that combines not only the rise of the Beats but also examines the slow emergence of recognition of sexual identity crises, in both a positive and a critical manner. Cast with a group of very fine actors and accompanied with musical director Nico Muhly's sensitive score that includes the references to Brahms symphonies and trios and transcriptions of themes along with terrific excerpts from Harlem's jazz scene (courtesy of Dawn Newman as a jazz singer), this film is successful on many levels, not the least of which is the reminder of the permanent impact on American literature and sociology imprinted by the likes of Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, and William Burroughs. The very sensitive opening sequence, appreciated only at film's end, sets the dark tone of the film and opens the window to understanding the Beats (also called ""the Libertine Circle"" by Ginsberg).The time is the mid 1940s and Allen Ginsberg (Daniel Radcliff) is an English major in Columbia University, assigned to be the roommate of Lucien 'Make me cry or make me horny' Carr (Dane DeHann) who awakens Ginsberg's rebellious self and introduces him to the work of Rimbaud. Dissatisfied by the orthodox attitudes of the school, Ginsberg finds himself drawn to iconoclastic colleagues like the egotistical but genius Lucien Carr, William S. Burroughs (Ben Foster) and Jack Kerouac (Jack Huston). Together, this gang would explore bold new literary ideas that would challenge Columbia University's staid stance and the sensibilities of their time as the future Beat Generation. However, for all their creativity, their very appetites and choices lead to more serious transgressions that would mark their lives forever. Lucien has been stalked since age 14 by the older gay David Kammerer (Michael C. Hall) who sees Lucien as his lover, but in this version of the story Lucien acted out his same sex proclivities with both Ginsberg and Kerouac. Lucien murders Kammerer and drags his body into the Hudson River (recall the opening scene of the film) and it is the advice of both Kerouac and Burroughs that leads to the judgment of the questionable verdict. Ginsberg goes on to create 'Howl' and Kerouac moves toward 'On the Road' and Carr becomes a journalist. Despite the at times confusing dichotomy between the murder story and the literary awakening the Beats introduced, this is a fascinating depiction of a movement of enormous impact. John Krokidas captures all the essence of the times in the 1940s New York City and his actors – especially Daniel Radcliff – bring this story to life. There is an uncredited role of Lucien Carr's mother superbly played by Kyra Sedgwick and any number of other fleeting bit parts that add to the mystique of the period. Recommended on many levels.",Kill Your Darlings
10,lasttimeisaw,powerful debut from John Krokidas,7,16 August 2014,"A dazzling character piece centers around a brutal murder case which implicates several future literature big shots of the beat generation, Allen Ginsberg (Radcliffe) is the freshman of Columbia University, he encounters a fellow student Lucien Carr (DeHaan), who brings him into a world of unorthodoxy and defiance against the rules and conformism, and he also meets the young Jack Kerouac (Huston) and William Burroughs (Foster). But Lucien's personal imbroglio with his fervent lover David Kammerer (C. Hall), a professor-turned-janitor, makes everything complicated, and eventually the real-life event changes their life path forever. It is director John Krokidas' powerful feature debut, affluently submerged into the zeitgeist of the time, with the alluring soundtrack and frenetic editing right on the ball, it is enthralling for most of its screening time! But a sticky problem is the brazen depiction of the drug-dependent inducement for inspiration and other crazy stuff such as asphyxiation attempt, although it is not a hagiography, but the impact strikes rather strong and it is too real to overlook. Basically it is a straightforward story, man A is in love with man B, who selfishly considers himself is out of A's league, moreover, there is a third man C is blindly obsessed with B, eventually a destructive denouement is a wake-up call for A, so he can withdraw from a no-good-ending infatuation and learn his lesson in a hard way. Redcliffe shows off his bent to immerse himself into a diversely challenging adult role and manage to unleash a manifesto declares that the most successful child star of our time is going to be a versatile thespians. As great as Redcliffe, the MVP here undeniably is DeHaan, whose unconventional charisma is lethally seductive but beguilingly hazardous, in the film, he is a merciless and contemptible egomaniac, a capricious manipulator and a doted kid, who is rebelling against the formality, but inside is wanting real talent, as he revealingly confesses, he is only an instigator, who can proffer vision for great minds, which he can keenly detect, that's why Ginsberg, Kerouac and Burroughs can all be together in one room, he is the magnet, the glue, the acute discernment is his expertise, DeHaan exerts an extraordinary ambiguity into his reasons and actions even in his cruelest scenes, we see devil on screen, disguised with an innocent mask. A stellar supporting cast including Cross and Jason Leigh as Allen's parents, a poet and his mad wife, Rasche is the rhetoric dean and Cullum is the established professor with a twist of unexpected sagacity in the coda, Kyra Sedgwick is uncredited as Lucien's mother. Huston and Olsen make a bickering couple before Kerouac sails for his ON THE ROAD journey, but both under-utilized. Michael C. Hall is heartbreakingly poignant in the critical stabbing replay, although his character is the biggest flaw in the plot, completely one-note and corny, he should have been more than a fool in love. Actually the unassuming and unheralded hero is Ben Foster, who is so good in dissolving himself into his character, his William Burroughs is never showy, he is a slow-burner, it is a great mimicry to say the least, one can hardly sense any trace of Foster's own personality in it, he is consistently excellent and overtly the best among his peers, a true chameleon is waiting for his moment to shine!Both DeHaan and Foster sneak into my year-end top 10 performances, DeHaan occupies the bronze presently, while Redcliffe misses the rank by just a notch (it is a difficult movie for Harry Potter devotees). As a first-timer, Krokidas accomplishes a pretty impressive debut, certainly deserves a spot on the watch-list of new-directors-on-the-horizon.",Kill Your Darlings
11,Irishchatter,A very dark and poetic film...,9,19 July 2015,"Well done to Daniel Radcliffe for putting on the accent, he really suited the role for playing a Jewish poet whom I never in my life heard of! Wow, I tell ya, Allen Ginsberg had such a roller coaster love life with Lucien Carr. He really fell for such a bad boy didn't he?Mind you, I'm glad he wasn't with him anymore because he was a bad influence on him especially interrupting him with his education at Columbia university and the fact, his poor mother was sent in a Nuthouse all thanks to his dimwitted father! Sure the poor guy had enough on his plate without getting involved with Lucien, he probably would have a better life if he completed his education and look after the mother as best he can. Although it's good to have a love life too but not someone who isn't worth your time! Unfortunately he did get too involved with Lucien. At least he had a long time partner who was Mr Peter Orlovsky,a person that was also a poet and didn't seem to be a bad ol boy! He should've been with him from the very start even!I find the film was really chilling and it shows a very troubled love story between Lucien and Allen......",Kill Your Darlings

Columbia University in the 1940's unknowingly gave life to some of the best poets in the world. Alan Ginsberg (Radcliffe) shows up and is almost instantly dissatisfied with what he finds. The school is too straight laced as far as teaching goes. He meets future legends Lucien Carr (DeHaan), William S. Burroughs and Jack Kerouac. What starts off as a group trying to change the world spirals out of control until a murder changes the lives of all of them. I have never been ""hip"" or into the beat poet scene. Never been a fan of Kerouac or even a big fan of Hunter S. Thompson for that matter. Not really sure why but they just never appealed to me. I watched On The Road but wasn't that impressed so I wasn't all that excited about watching this one. I do have to admit that this was much better then I expected. This one had a Dead Poet's Society aspect to it and I think that is why I ended up liking it. If you are a fan of the beat poet generation then you will love this. I liked how the character interactions grew to an explosive resolution, that was interesting to me. Overall, much better then On The Road, but this movie made me want to watch that one again now that I know more about the relationships. I give this a B.",Kill Your Darlings
13,Reno-Rangan,"Good young actors but very poor chemistry, somehow convinced",7,18 March 2014,"Still not satisfied with Daniel Radcliffe performance. He has to come out from the character Harry Potter. He must lose his eye glass and try to give natural expressions. He has to learn a lot to be a great actor in this competitive cinema world or downfall is guaranteed.It was a good story, but Radcliffe ruined it in few occasions. He tried his best in many parts, I liked his hard work and execution. I though Dane DeHaan tried to stir whole ship by himself behalf of his co- stars, but his role was not built well. Because the story was told from Radcliffe perspective. Yeah, it is the fact that Dane DeHaan saved the movie as much he could.It was based on a real person and a gay theme. The story sets in the 40s where two students in the English major in Columbia university try to revolutionise the future literacy with their unique ideas. The efforts are made, but stuck in a confused relationship that harms everything in front of them.As based on homosexual from an earlier era, it was presented well. Kept background secrets of a character to break in at a right time of the story. Initially the title explains its meaning, but as the story progress it becomes more reality. I feel bad to blame everything on Radcliffe but I know someday I gonna praise him with my full heart. I was saying that it would have been nice if his role was given to some other actors like Andrew Garfield or Freddie Highmore.

I did not like the direction which was made by John Krokidas because he did not present very well the main actors, their stories, their feelings and their past. This had as a result the audience to not relate with them and do not totally understand the plot and the story-line of the movie.

15,Dr_Coulardeau,The Beat Generation deserves more empathy,8,25 April 2014,"A film that was expected by many people, because of an actor who were getting out of a teenage part that had lasted six or seven years, like Daniel Radcliffe, or an actor surviving a long series, and his own cancer, like Michael C. Hall. But as for me the main reason was the subject of that film, the birth of the beat generation, the meeting of the main protagonists of the beat generation to be and become. We are in 1943 and we meet young students at Columbia University in New York. They are all going to be the writers and poets of that post war lost generation that will beat their guilt out of their minds and beat us down into our own guilt.We all know Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, William Burroughs and Lucien Carr. It is true the fifth character of this pentacle, David Kammerer, is not really known for what he has achieved in his own life, what he has left behind under his own name. He just was the English teacher who fell in love with his pupil Lucien Carr who fell in love too but as a teenager who had to grow out of this pubescent love and did not know how to do it, especially since David Kammerer did not know he had to yield and step away. Instead of that he followed the young man and haunted him.Our four future poets and writers were all in breaking rules and experimenting all kinds of strange things, drugs, morphine, alcohol of course, marihuana, but also the excitement and thrill they could get out of violating some good old standards in their society, like sexual taboos and rejected sexual orientations. But they all had to break themselves, to collide into one another and bruise, hurt and even dismantle one another and themselves. It looks as if their future talent had to be born in the blood of a sacrificed innocent man whose sole crime was to love one of them excessively, obsessively, compulsively. That's the most dramatic and unexplainable fact in their lives and careers. They all needed that death to become. I just hope they were haunted by their guilt till the end of their own lives.Strangely enough their society was lenient, even for the actual murderer, and that can be explained easily by the fact that David Kammerer was gay and their society at the time was definitely and irredeemably antigay. Lucien Carr could have pleaded non guilty because David Kammerer being a homosexual, he had the right to defend his honor and kill him. But Allan Ginsberg, definitely, and Jack Kerouac more or less, not to speak of William Burroughs who was retrieved and taken away by his own father, had to tell the truth in a way or another, and to let everyone, and Lucien Carr first of all, know the truth: Lucien Carr was in love with David Kammerer, which made him a homosexual too. He thus had to accept the verdict of murder in the first degree. And yet he only got eighteen months of probationary detention. Quite cheap for the life of a man, even a homosexual!But what remains the real truth for us is that these four poets and writers found their inspiration and force in those mixed orientations and in that crime, described in all its ugliness: discover the details in the film itself. And we are shown the horror twice, plus told about it in full detail one third time, along with the first visual demonstration. No way for us not to know the obsessive and compulsive obligation, necessity, impulse, desire and even fascination to commit that murder, to kill that man, slowly and systematically, as some kind of a last final commitment to each other till death them part and death, inflicted by the young man to the older man, does part them.We will say it is very romantic to find one's artistic inspiration in one's suffering, but here that romanticism is sadistic since they find their inspiration in the suffering they inflict onto one another, including onto an outsider who tries to stick to their small circle of . . . what can we call them? Friends? I doubt it.The film is packed with fast action, rich piles of artifacts and props, and the actors are all quite seasoned in their guilt and non-repentance, the non-repentance of some crocodiles shedding tears on the suffering of others when they only shed tears on their own misery which is no misery at all since anyway they will be able to use their families or their connections to get through. The film does not in any way acclaim, applaud and approve of this beat generation, but it rather shows how they were lost because they were from more or less well off families: they hated it but they used it skillfully in order to avoid punishment or to get a second chance. The only one who really did it with his own hands is Jack Kerouac, but he was like the fifth wheel of a wagon, the one who took part but did not really belong. But the film also contains some easy symbolism like showing William Burroughs shooting himself with morphine, Allen Ginsberg being sexually penetrated by some unknown outsider he had accidentally picked in the street, and Lucien Carr repeatedly stabbing David Kammerer. It is easy and it is also far-fetched as if drug addiction, gay sex and killing a gay partner were the same thing, as if gay orientation led necessarily to anal sex shown on the screen, a syringe in your arm and a knife in the chest of your lover, the three at the same time and in close and dense succession. It even could sound like exposure more than fair presentation. Is the film ambiguous about this beat generation?Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",Kill Your Darlings
16,filipemanuelneto,"A gay apology, with nasty characters and a fastidious plot.",2,3 November 2017,"This is one of those movies that I can only understand and evaluate after researching about it. It all begins when Allen Ginsberg joins the prestigious and ultra-conservative Columbia University during World War II. There, he will meet a group of unconventional friends, with pleasure in breaking rules and confronting authorities. From this embryo, as I came to discover, would be born the ""Beat Generation"" (I had never even heard of it before watching). The script, however, seems indecisive. I've never been able to figure out whether the movie is about the ""Beat Generation"" or simply about Allen Ginsberg, the way he met his friends and the homicide related to them. This indefinition made the film tedious, with many dead moments that would have been cut off if there was some certainty on the subject. John Krokidas was unable to direct the film toward a clear and definite goal. He just went shooting.Another problem of this film are the characters. Everything revolves around Ginsberg, the only truly well-built character. All the others are sketches and drafts, and the way the actors worked did not help mitigate that. Dane DeHaan is a stranger to me, has managed to show psychological depth and showed some talent, but his character is too iconoclastic and unpleasant for me to care about it and the same can be said of all other characters and actors. Daniel Radcliffe, who was left with the main role, has a lot of talent and is the best actor here, but his character is quite unpleasant. Another problem here was the feeling that the film makes a kind of apology to homosexuality, something that I definitely don't approve. I know the mainstream thinking of our society tends to accept it as a different form of love, but I have the right to disagree and think otherwise without anyone being able to criticize me for it. We shouldn't live in mental dictatorships, in which mainstream dictates thoughts and opinions that we all must accept. Unfortunately, this happens and these apologies end up appearing very much like subliminal fascist or communist propaganda, used by authoritarian regimes that most people condemn. To what extent, using the cover of our democracy and mass media, does society force us to accept opinions or keep quiet if we disagree with them? It's a rhetorical question, but pertinent.By way of conclusion, I say that I expected something else from this film. A more focused, goal-oriented script would have been more interesting. A more neutral and natural approach to the characters' sexuality would have removed the apologetic and propagandistic burden I've mentioned. More elaborate characters, capable of building empathy with public, would have resulted in greater public involvement and increased our interest in what's happening. It's a boring, tiring movie that only those who enjoy counterculture or the Beat movement will appreciate. About the crime the film portrays, I was left with the feeling that it is a mere detail of the plot.",Kill Your Darlings
17,leonblackwood,Great Concept! 4/10,4,26 April 2014,"Review: I really struggled to enjoy this movie. There is quite a few storyline's going on at once and, to be honest, I did lose interest after a whole because of its slow pace, but once it get going it isn't totally bad. The other problem that I had with the movie was Daniel Radcliffe as the lead because he seemed pretty stiff and emotionless. All of the other actors, like Ben Foster, Michael C. Hall & Dane DeHaan, put in great performances which made the film enjoyable when the twists and turns take place. For a first time director, he done quite a good job with this true story, but I did struggle to stay awake through the whole movie. Watchable!Round-Up: I didn't really understand what the group of college students were trying to attempt with there poetry clan, which is why I only really concentrated on the ending. The person who really stood out for me was Ben Foster who is a drug taking student with millionaire parents. I still find it hard to take Daniel Radcliffe seriously after being the main character in the Harry Potter franchise. As I hadn't really heard of the movie before, I was surprised to see that the characters really existed and that the situation that they landed themselves into was a real case, which was shocking. Anyway, I don't think that this will change anyone's perception of Daniel Radcliffe's acting capabilities, but it's pretty average entertainment. Budget: N/A Worldwide Gross: $1millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there college student dramas about a group of friends causing problems at school. 4/10",Kill Your Darlings
18,l_rawjalaurence,Slightly Muddled Tale of the Beat Generation,6,11 December 2013,"John Krokidas' film explores the early life of Allen Ginsberg (Daniel Radcliffe), and how he came into contact with Lucien Carr (Dane DeHaan), Jack Kerouac (Jack Huston), and William Burroughs (Ben Foster). Through their association the ideas of the Beat Generation were born. The film starts off very promisingly, depicting Ginsberg's early life at home in Paterson, New Jersey, and his subsequent career at Columbia University. We understand something of he and his friends wanted to rebel against established conventions - not only literary but societal conventions. The 'official' view, as propounded by Professor Stevens (John Cullum) seems stuffy and old-fashioned. As the action progresses, however, so the film's priorities become diluted; rather than focusing on the genesis of the Beats, the action concentrates instead on the complex love-triangle involving Lucien, Allen and David Kammerer (Michael C. Hall). We are given the distinct suggestion all of three of them are emotionally immature, which thereby reduces the significance of their 'rebellion.' Matters are not helped by Radcliffe's rather colorless performance as Ginsberg - his expressions rarely change from being rather bemused as what's happening around him. A brave attempt at recreating the values of a previous generation, but the director seems to lose the courage of his convictions.",Kill Your Darlings

As Freud said, there are no accidents, where there's smoke there's fire, and a cigar is never just a cigar. Since James Franco nailed the role of poet Allen Ginsberg three years ago in HOWL (not to mention Tom Sturridge's foray as Ginsberg in last year's ON THE ROAD), KILL YOUR DARLINGS is a Ginsberg movie in NAME ONLY. It REALLY is using the broad outline of Allen's college freshman year to pick up where Harry Potter, Part 8 left off. Radcliffe's part, as Ginsberg, actually is an unedited version of Harry, of course. Dane DeHaan as homophobic bisexual thrill killer Lucien Carr is meant to be Ron, unplugged. Jack Huston's Jack Kerouac suggests the true Hermione, the brilliant know-it-all who's the guy all the boys want to be, if only she wasn't a girl (and in KILL YOUR DARLINGS, Hermione is at least half a boy). Draco Malfoy's true nature and his more fitting end come out in the part of murder victim David Kemmerer, played by Michael C. Hall. David is the only one with the guts to stand up for who he actually is, and he gets killed for his pains. If any actual Ginsberg fans are planning to see KILL YOUR DARLINGS, let me clue you in on something: this flick portrays Allen as a second generation schizophrenic; a self-cutter addicted to the deadly auto-erotic ""hanging game,"" hellbent on trying every known drug in the 1940s, and parading himself as an anarchist book destroyer at a time American newsreels featured Nazi book burnings. If anything, the movie is designed to inspire viewers to get high, steal all the Gingsberg from their local bookstores, and burn them in front of police stations. On the other hand, if you want to complete your ""Out-of-the-Closet in 2013 Tour"" with the Potter crew, just stream CHARLIE COUNTRYMAN, in which Ron (Rupert Grint, playing the role of ""Karl"") is dying to become a male porn star and swallows a bottle of Viagara.

20,estebangonzalez10,Getting to know the Beat Generation,6,27 March 2014,"""Another lover hits the universe. The circle is broken. But with death comes rebirth. And like all lovers and sad people, I am a poet.""I knew nothing about Kill Your Darlings going into this movie (which means I basically don't know anything about modern American literature because apparently these guys were famous poets that influenced their generation during the 50's with their literary work). Known today as the Beat generation, they basically rejected the moral standards imposed at the time and innovated in style while experimenting with drugs and sex. Many films based on their work have been adapted for for the big screen (Howl, On the Road, and Naked Lunch), but I haven't seen them, so I actually went into this film without knowing anything about these writers. The film serves as an introduction as to how these writers came together and influenced one another during their teenage years, and it is told from Allen Ginsberg's point of view. This biographical drama/thriller may not be entirely factual, but it is still a fascinating story, and once the film ended it made me want to know about who these people were. The film's main attraction is the excellent chemistry between Daniel Radcliffe and Dane DeHaan who give excellent performances (and after a while you actually forget Radcliffe is Harry Potter). The supporting cast is also strong, including Michael C. Hall, Ben Foster, and Jack Huston. I'm a huge fan of Elizabeth Olsen, but in this film her character wasn't given much to work with, but it makes sense considering the Beat generation is a male dominated movement. It ended up influencing the hippie movement in the 60's and popular rock bands like The Beatles. This film only focuses on the early stages of their lives, but it shows how these artists came to know each other and how Lucien Carr was the most influential figure in their formation.The screenplay was co-written by director John Krokidas and Austin Bunn focusing on the early stages of Alan Ginsberg's (Daniel Radcliffe) life as he began studying at Columbia University which shaped his philosophical views on life. The turning point in his life was when he met his classmate, Lucien Carr (Dane DeHaan) who taught him to question the orthodox methods of the school and introduced him to other future icons of the Beat generation: William S. Burroughs (Ben Foster), and Jack Kerouac (Jack Huston). Together they would hang out in night clubs exploring new literary ideas and basically rediscovering themselves. They were against moral boundaries and explored with drugs and sex. Alan and some of the others also dealt with their homosexuality, while some tried to hide it. Lu also introduced Alan to one of his mentors, David Krammerer (Michal C. Hall), who was obsessed with Lu and ultimately led to a tragic event. The film succeeds mostly because of the great performances from the young cast and because it is actually an intriguing story. John Krokidas isn't a director I was familiar with, but he does a decent job with this film. The film does have a believable 40's style and it stays true to the period. It is really well paced as well and it begins to get more interesting once the crime takes place. Unfortunately the film does lack some structure and at times I felt like it was wandering off. The scenes with Allen's mother never were explored much, but we understand how it affected his life and his relationship with his father. The characters are sometimes a bit too clever and don't feel real at times. Still, I was engaged with this film thanks to the material which is very interesting and I enjoyed the performances very much. The film is ambiguous at times, but that is what will leave you thinking and wanting to learn more about these characters at the end. It is all over the place at times, but I was drawn in to the story and for a biopic it gets the job done.",Kill Your Darlings
21,peterp-450-298716,A not so obvious movie with Radcliffe in a a bold and admirable part.,5,19 September 2014,"""Some things, once you've loved them, become yours forever. And if you try to let them go... They only circle back and return to you. They become part of who you are......or they destroy you.""After watching a few blockbusters I always get the urge to put on a not so commercial film. The title of this one combined with the fact that I'm not a real expert in literature, made ​​sure that my expectations about ""Kill your darlings"" were totally misjudged. The phrase ""Kill your darlings"" is used in literary circles and is a maxim for writers and poets to delete favorite wordings, adjectives or phrases so that their writings become tighter and not defiled with unnecessary ballast. So you can expect to hear a lot of intellectual posturing in this film. It's actually a biographical drama about the origins of the ""beat generation"" in America and the young adults who support this : Allen Ginsburg, Jack Kerouac and William Burroughs. All of them became renowned writers and poets after wards.I also was an avid bookworm in the past and I devoured innumerable books. I wasn't a fan of the literature with a capital L, but rather took pleasure in reading books written by Jack Vance, Raymond Elias Feist, Terry Pratchett, Terry Goodkind and Koontz among others. Not exactly literary heavyweights but masters of the fantasy and SF genre. My intellectual level probably wasn't of such a nature that I could appreciate magical realism, expressionism or neo-romanticism. Just as modern art, I think it means, describing the most trivial objects in such way, that they become fascinating objects. At one stage Allen, William and Lucien shred some books from great writers in pieces, and text fragments are nailed to the wall so they can form a coherent whole. A creation of literature out of chaos as it were. However I can empathize with the mood of the characters involved. I myself was also such a rebel once and didn't have the attitude of walking within the lines. Ultimately, you can see these beatniks as early forerunners of an anarchist movement in literature. Kicking the standardized writers who abide all elitist rules and styles in the shins.The film is set in the aftermath of the 2nd World War, which is reflected in the whole atmosphere : the decor, the props, the music and the zeitgeist. This is also the most successful item in this film directed by John Krokidas. His first feature film he surely can be proud of and in which he succeeds in portraying the feeling of that time. You are witnessing the tipping point in the prudish American society where the youth of that time was looking for new trends and creative outlets. This manifested itself in dank little pubs where they played jazz, pseudo intellectual gatherings where gallons of alcohol was being consumed, experimenting with all kinds of mind-altering drugs and scanning the sexual boundaries and tolerances in this area.The performances were all sublime. Dane DeHaan as the extrovert and intellectual Lucien Carr, the pivotal figure in this whole drama, who does look like a gay, blue-eyed blonde charmer, but reflects a genuine uncertainty about his sexual orientation. Michael ""Dexter"" Hall, who recently starred in ""Cold in July"", plays a homosexual stalker who sinks to the bottom of some pond in the beginning of the film. Jack Huston as Jack Kerouac. Ben Foster as William Burroughs. An intellectual who comes from a wealthy family, who's constantly experimenting with all sorts of drugs and therefore speaks in slow motion with a deep, rough voice the entire movie. And Daniel ""Harry"" Radcliffe as Allen Ginsberg. Radcliffe really does some effort to finally wipe that ""Potter"" stamp away. I have to admit that he plays in this film with very different magic wands. And yet I admire him for not giving in and choosing the obvious roles. After his not so bad performance in ""The woman in black"" he's now trying a more serious role with some fairly bold homosexual scenes. I'm still wondering about his sexual orientation now. The passion he shows while kissing his male opponents speaks volumes. And despite his efforts, once and a while that ""Harry Potter""-smile that made him famous, appears again. After he sees the act of Carr in the school library you can admire that boyish roguish smile. The only thing missing is that twinkle in his eyes. Not a bad performance, but at times it was really superficial and it seemed more like a Shakespearean tragedy.A difficult film. And despite its boring subject, it continued to fascinate me. A crime drama without that much drama. A passion that leads to a crime, but it's certainly not the emphasis. It's rather a film full of philosophical musings and constant literary debating by those who'll be the greatest in literature. All this with a solid bottle of wine and glass of whiskey after a hearty sniff of nitrous oxide. At times I also wished I had that in reach so this film would be more light-hearted. But still, respect for Radcliffe.More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be",Kill Your Darlings
22,caspian1978,Vulnerable Depiction,7,3 August 2020,"To date. this movie has depicted the early members of the Beat Generation with the most authenticity. Daniel Radcliffe does a fantastic job portraying Allen Ginsberg as we see him as a weak, frightened, child who is conflicted with his friends, family and educators. Dane DeHaan does a very good job showcasing Lucien Carr's sex appeal, naive innocents and his sociopath like tendencies to get what he wants. Although he tries to play the victim, you see the control he has over others as their Muse. Ben Foster steals the movie with the best portrayal of William Burroughs ever. He alone is worth watching the movie. Beat fans will find faults with this movie, but they will enjoy it none the less because for one simple reason.

23,Amari-Sali,"Love awakens a writer, while his love interest seeks to destroy, and push away, everything he has.",8,25 May 2014,"I should probably note, right off the bat, you mention any of the names in the film besides Allen Ginsberg and I will say ""who?"" And I note this because it seems very much like the type of film fans of not just Daniel Radcliffe, Michael C. Hall, and others may get into, but also those who have fallen in love with the authors, and those who inspired their work. I would honestly argue though, the one who comes out best in the film is Dane DeHaan, for reasons listed below.Characters & StoryA college bound Allen Ginsberg (Daniel Radcliffe) we meet as a mousy, awkward, but slightly confidant young man thanks to his father's work being prominent. But, as the film goes on, he finds himself becoming one of the rebel voices at Columbia University. Especially upon the acquaintance of Lucien Carr (Dane DeHaan). Lucien, in more ways than one, is a charmer. Someone capable of capturing the attention of anyone in the room, and anyone lucky enough to get reciprocity of their attention seemingly loses their minds.Take David (Michael C. Hall) for example. His love for Lucien, commonly known as Lu, seems insatiable. And though he seems like a creepy stalker at first, Ginsberg is soon to learn how addicting Lu can be to the point of becoming almost obsessed himself. Unfortunately for him though, Lu is deeply troubled and seems willing, and able, to drag people just as much into a stupor, as he can into his despair. But with so many talented minds surrounding him, and each one a legend in the making, a story is told about love, lust, drugs, and murder which will undoubtedly makes for good watching.PraiseAnd the reason why is because, even if you are as unfamiliar with everyone as I am, the story within itself is well done. You could easily write this off, if it was pure fiction, as a great coming of age romance story, with the only difference between what we usually see and what this film is being that Ginsburg doesn't meet a girl who changes his life, but a young man, being Lucien. With their bromance, though sort of love story, we see what seems to be your usual little bud blossom, and watching this film really helps me see Radcliffe as more than Harry Potter, and really makes it so that it is simply a role he did, and not the total of his existence/ talents.As for everyone else, DeHaan as Lucien embodied an almost seductive style which easily could make even a straight man curious. Take a young Leonardo DiCaprio and combine him with the vampire Lestat then you have DeHaan as Lucien. He is vibrant, charming, a bit of a deviant, but difficult to take your eyes off of. And with both Hall and Jack Kerouac, as Jack Huston, showing how addictive his company can be, even if perhaps in the platonic way in terms of Jack, it is hard to argue that while Radcliffe may have the recognizable name, DeHaan does steal some of his thunder.CriticismIn all honesty, the only criticism that I can even come up with is a rather weak one. Which is that if you aren't a big fan of old white authors and their literature, a lot of the works that Lucien, Ginsberg, David, and the others mention may go over your head. And considering how these men, as well as Ben Foster as William S. Burroughs, speak in such a manner which is very sophisticated, the dialog can sometimes come off as a bit pretentious. But considering that maybe what these people are, perhaps it is just fitting?Overall: Worth SeeingI feel it is becoming increasingly rare for me to find a movie I genuinely like. Perhaps the quantity of films I have seen has now effected how I see quality, but in terms of Kill Your Darlings, I do feel this one stands a bit above the rest. For with a compelling story, featuring literature's greatest; dynamic and enrapturing performances, of which help command your attention to the point of wanting to follow their careers; and with hardly any weaknesses overall, it is rather hard to say this is anything but worth seeing.",Kill Your Darlings

25,napierslogs,The story of Allen Ginsberg during some of his more interesting years,9,4 February 2014,"""Kill Your Darlings"" is the story of Allen Ginsberg (Daniel Radcliffe) as he arrives at college and is ushered into a new generation of writers. Ginsberg is young, naïve and innocent. He was raised by his father – a writer (in the very traditional sense), and his mentally unstable mother. Columbia University presents a whole new world, a bright future for this talented man.But Columbia University also presents ideas previously unknown to the sheltered Ginsberg. A fellow student stands on a desk reading from a banned book and when someone with authority claims that it is a restricted book, he responds, ""That's why I committed it to memory."" Ginsberg watches with admiration. When he's looking at a New York subway map, he's warned not to take a particular place. ""It's the land of the ferries; you'll never get back.""Ginsberg never will be the person he was before any of these moments. The film is about the formative years of Allen Ginsberg. The college years that formed him into the writer he became. Which leads me to the screenplay. These writers clearly know their Beat writers providing these visionary characters with dialogue that they probably would have said. But also providing the audience with a structure that we would prefer.The arrogance and notoriety of the Beat Generation are perfectly captured. It was there in full view, but we met Allen Ginsberg early enough in his life that we still liked him. We really just feel sorry for him when he falls in with Lucien Carr (Dane DeHaan). Their attempts to get high and live were wholly unhealthy, but of course they would argue that it leads to producing some of the most creative and widely- read literary works in the world. And that that's more important than doing anything ""normal."" Well, that's your call.This film is about the characters, how they interact with one another, how they influence one another, and how Allen Ginsberg became the revolutionary poet that the world knows him as. ""Kill Your Darlings"" is a story of sex, drugs and murder. The former elements are of course present in every story of the Beat Generation, but the latter is what provides a new element for this film, to give the story a fresh take and something interesting to say.",Kill Your Darlings
26,drjgardner,The beat generation misses a beat,3,2 November 2013,"There is a great story to be told about the beat generation. This isn't it.Kill Your Darlings (2013) is a biographical drama about the early adult years of the beat generation stalwarts Allen Ginsburg (1926-97), Jack Kerouac (1922-69), and William Burroughs (1914-97). For those of you who don't know the details, Ginsburg achieved much acclaim for his literary works, including a National Book Award for ""The Fall of America"" (1974) and a Pulitzer Prize nomination for ""Poems 1986-1992"" (1995). He was famous for his support of homosexuality and his opposition to the Vietnam War. Kerouac is most famous for his classic ""On The Road"" (1951) and his later ""Big Sur"" (1962). Burroughs was a prolific author (""Junkie"", ""Naked Lunch"") whose themes of death, drugs, and homosexuality can be seen in their beginning phases in this film.)The whole idea of the beat generation was that if you could dismantle the structure of communication and still have some worth, then anything was up for grabs. If poetry could give up rhyme and still have substance, then sex could give up its hetero prefix and still have love, and society could give up its mores and still find order. To such a message, the dull and plodding structure of standard film school does no homage. Nor do the film makers even seem aware of the message of the beat generation, putting in scenes of jazz, sex, drugs, and English class without seeming to understand their inter-relationships.There is a great story to be told about the beat generation. This isn't it.",Kill Your Darlings
27,JvH48,College years of famous writers and their tumultuous relationships visualized very well,8,16 October 2013,"I saw this film at the Ghent (Belgium) film festival 2013, where is was part of the official Competition. For a brief but scary moment I thought myself sitting in the wrong venue and deja-vu-ing The Perks Of Being A Wallflower, a movie highly praised all over, but I hated it from the beginning to the very end. I remember that I wanted to walk out at that time, but didn't for two reasons. One that I sat in the middle of a row in a fully booked venue. Second that I wondered the whole movie long what it could be that I overlooked, knowing its high praises from various reputable sources. Luckily I soon realized that this movie Kill Your Darlings is completely different, in spite of the fact that it also follows a university freshman and would-be writer. So from the outside my initial fear was justified.Back to the movie at hand: Kill Your Darlings succeeded in keeping my attention for the full 104 minutes. The well known fact that writers, and in particular poets, are whimsical and change moods every other minute, is showcased very well by the actors, and the story gives them every chance to let us see that they can. It is not easy to tell where the plot is all about, and I don't think it is useful to try anyway. Summarizing it can only do injustice to the complex, shifting relationships between the main characters. Same injustice will result from throwing plot keywords, for example: poets, alcohol, sex, betrayal, and drugs. By the way: one of the keywords on IMDb is also gay relationship, a possible showstopper for some feeling uneasy watching gay sex, but they can relax: there is only one such scene, it lasts one minute max, and no male genitals are visible.All in all, very good script and very well executed, with believable casting and acting. After my initial deja-vu fear that I was re-watching a movie that I grossly disliked at the time, I enjoyed this one very much, in spite of the dark understream and the unhappy ending. Maybe that someone having read (or even studied) the works of these famous writers, finds many treasures in this movie that I unknowingly missed. I'm not familiar with their literature, a fact of life that cannot be helped, not being a native speaker of the English language (in school we had to study other writers). For the audience award it ranked 21st, with score 4.07 out of 5. I would not be surprised when others in the audience were unfamiliar with these writers too, mostly non-native English speakers just like me, but the ultimate score clearly confirms their appreciation anyway for the movie, that can stand on its own feet without needing to recognize the text quotes flying around.",Kill Your Darlings

Burroughs: A Man Within'), bio-pics ('Howl') and adaptations of their work ('On the Road'). However, none has covered the time period where all of these writers met in college and were part of a murder. First time feature filmmaker John Krokidas tackles this story and knocks it out of the park with his jazzy, drug-induced opus called 'Kill Your Darlings'.This film shows the very beginning of the Beat Generation, including the friendships and influences that shaped these iconic writers that we study today. 'Kill Your Darlings' starts out almost like a thriller in the vein of 'Se7en', with Allen Ginsberg (Daniel Radcliffe) in a jail cell, talking to his supposed friend who has just murdered somebody. We then flash back to earlier in the year, when the young Allen heads out to college for the first time.This is a difficult decision for Allen. His father Louis (David Cross, who actually played Allen Ginsberg in Todd Haynes' 'I'm Not There'), wants his son to stay home and look after his unstable, schizophrenic mother (Jennifer Jason Leigh). Nonetheless, Allen ships off to Columbia University, which he's clearly emotional about. During his orientation, an older and very charismatic student named Lucien Carr (Dane DeHaan) leaps onto the library desk and shouts out sexually explicit writings from Henry Miller. This peaks Allen's interest immediately.The two become friends. Lucien takes Allen under his sick and twisted wing, showing him the insane New York nightlife – its jazz clubs with sketchy characters, and a great deal of drugs. At an apartment party, Allen meets William Burroughs (Ben Foster), who's first seen sitting in a bathtub, fully clothed and inhaling nitrous oxide. A little later, he's introduced to Jack Kerouac (Jack Huston), the oldest of the bunch. Kerouac is charming and tough, but has problems with his girlfriend (Elizabeth Olsen, who in my opinion is not used to her full talent here).Still coming to terms with his who he is, Allen begins to have feelings for Lucien. However, he soon realizes that Lucien uses his charm and sex appeal to get what he wants, like making Allen write his college essays for him, since he doesn't have any real talent of his own. Through this time, the four writers hit the town in a drug induced stupor. These drug-fueled nights send Allen banging away at his typewriter keyboard, even pleasuring himself while writing.Some of the best parts of the film involve watching these future iconic writers simply being college kids and friends. They laugh, drink, smoke and even pull pranks. One scene resembles something out of 'Animal House', as the four break into the library after dark to swap the literature passages displayed in glass cases with images of porn and death. Director Krokidas uses modern music to show that these students were ahead of their time and had a rebellious side.Eventually, Krokidas constructs a sequence that culminates with the Riverside Park murder of David Kammerer (Michael C. Hall), a peripheral friend with a creepily unhealthy obsession with Lucien.The actors all turn in amazing performances. Radcliffe and DeHaan shine over the rest, since they have much more to work with. DeHaan gives Lucien so much magnetism and charm that it's hard not to like him, even though we shouldn't.Not only is this a movie about a murder, it's a movie about some of the most famous authors of the 20th Century, finding out who they are and who they will eventually set out to be. It sure is one hell of a coming of age story.",Kill Your Darlings

There are so many stories it does not tell, so many themes it cannot explore, so much overall phoniness and shallow ignorance of life, the universe, and everything.It's not a moving coming-of-age story. Nor a thoughtful analysis of Allen Ginsberg's poetry. Nor an evocative film about the World War II era. Nor a chilling crime drama, even though the climax involves a brutal stabbing. Nor a stark, uncompromising look at the dangers of drug and alcohol abuse, even though every single character is presented as some kind of addict. Nor an honest and candid exploration of the social pressures of college life then or now. There were at least five or six good movies you could have made with this material, and instead they made this foul sewage. As I watched this movie, I kept wondering if I was being unfair. I mean, given how vile all the characters are, and how ugly and sad the ending is, could anyone have done a better job? But then I thought of THE BASKETBALL DIARIES, based on the life of Jim Carroll, starring Mark Wahlberg and Leonardo DiCaprio. Ugly scenes of drug abuse? Brutally real violence? The emptiness of higher education stripped bare? Homosexuality right in your face? It's all there, but in THE BASKETBALL DIARIES the stakes are much higher. These people really matter. Even the poetry sounds better!KILL YOUR DARLINGS could have been a good movie. But it wasn't. And by the way, the ""Beat"" movement was not a club for gay men. Plenty of gay men hated the Beats. And plenty of Beats hated gay men. There was no love lost between Truman Capote and Jack Kerouac. In fact, Truman Capote famously said of Kerouac's ON THE ROAD, ""that's not writing, that's typing.""

The main character in this movie is Allen Ginsberg (Daniel Radcliffe), but the movie revolved around Lucien Carr (Dane DeHaan). The plot zeroes in on the crime that played such a big role in their lives and in some of their books.However, this movie is really about capturing the zeitgeist and personalities of these larger-than-life figures. For this group, Columbia University from 1943 to 1945 was a time and place where poetry and literature mattered. Really, REALLY mattered. What I liked in particular was how the film sidestepped all the usual movie conventions about what society was like during the war, and shines a spotlight instead on the drug-soaked world of these people. Many movies about the 1940s look rather modern, but this movie shows us a strange 1940s New York that seems a world away.This movie is about not much more than a group of gay party kids who have grand, anti-establishment notions, but are seriously into drugs and get into serious trouble. However, the movie has the deliberate pace, self awareness, seriousness, elegiac feel and earnest acting that come with an homage. (I'm not knocking the scene at all, but I half-expected religious music to well up when Allen has sex for the first time.) The homosexuality was dealt with well in the movie. It's nice to see honest historical depictions of this. Part of the movie is the story of Ginsberg's sexual awakening. Of course I'm also wondering why we need another movie about gays who commit crimes, attempt suicide, and are unstable and generally unhappy. The movie makes the point that one of the real tragedies here is homophobia, David's murder and how easily Lu got off, and how Lu spent the rest of his life in the closet.There is a message about love in there, reflected in the title. With one or two exceptions, I thought the movie was well acted, but I'm not sure about the casting. For one thing, the actors were too old. Also, it was a little difficult to see why everyone was falling for, sleeping with or otherwise hanging out with Lu.This is an interesting historical drama. I suspect I would have enjoyed it more if I had ever read any of these writers. I'm afraid that it's still not clear to me why I should. Poetry and literature have its place, but do they really matter anymore, given the onslaught of visual media and information? Perhaps that's another point of the film. The world has changed so much in seven decades. Why do these minor figures matter? I suppose there is a direct connection between this young men and the blossoming and liberalisation that took place in the 1960s and 1970s. I'm just speculating though.",Kill Your Darlings
33,rubenm,Conventional film about unconventional people,4,5 April 2014,"The Beat Poets movement was all about breaking the rules, about fighting clichés and traditions, about shaking things up, about the rough edges of life, about confronting the establishment. If I would make a film about this movement, it would be a film with a similar attitude. By all means, I wouldn't want it to be a conventional film.This is where I'm different from John Krokidas. 'Kill Your Darlings', his film about the Beat Poets, is extremely conventional. It's polished and traditional, not controversial or innovative. It doesn't have any rough edges, nor does it shake things up. It tells the story of Allen Ginsberg, the young student who gets introduced to a group of rebellious fellow students, and to their unconventional way of living. He even gets involved in a gay love triangle with fatal consequences. This is interesting material, but the film doesn't do anything with it, apart from showing it in nice, perfect images. The jazz club where they come together looks nice, their clothes look nice, everything is nice. But the Beat Poets weren't nice, they were out of control, angry and mad. The film should have been angry and mad too, but it isn't. And that's a pity.",Kill Your Darlings
34,christophe92300,Uninspired,3,1 June 2014,"Kill Your Darlings is labelled biopic and drama but the movie fails on both aspects.First, the scenario only glances over the emergence of the Beat Generation and its three founding authors : for the literature neophytes — a fortiori non-American persons — the movie doesn't teach anything about that movement, its roots, its consequences, and the importance of the stakes is not palpable at all.The scenario tries in parallel to develop a drama/thriller that turns out to be not much convincing, there was much better to do with this storyline about homosexuality at an intolerant time.The cast, though badly directed, is extremely bland and only Daniel Radcliffe arouses any emotion (which is a desire to murder).All in all, there is nothing to draw from this movie one will make forget as soon as finished.",Kill Your Darlings
35,davidgee,Daniel Radcliffe's ON THE WATERFRONT? Maybe. Maybe not.,6,18 December 2013,"The movie has two threads: the gay love triangle around Lucien Carr and the Beat Poets-in-waiting's rebellion against stuffy literary conventions. Replacing Columbia library's displayed classics with some porno-lite books like LADY CHATTERLEY and Miller's TROPICS was, in 1944, the height of cultural anarchy!I found Jack Huston's Kerouac the most believable of the authors-to-be; you sense the pent-up restlessness that will soon take him 'on the road' and his cavalier attitude to both his girlfriends and gay admirers. Dane DeHaan's Lucien is meant to be the Sebastian Flyte of this take on BRIDESHEAD sexuality, but in the darker scenes both he and Michael C. Hall are not entirely convincing, the fault perhaps of the writing rather than the acting. Daniel Radcliffe gets his accent just right, neither overdone nor under-done, and is clearly taking a big risk with his Harry Potter fan-base in a gay role. The part calls for a certain awkwardness - Ginsberg is very repressed at this stage in his life - and Radcliffe also gets this right, but you wonder if he could deliver a role that called for greater intensity. Jennifer Jason Leigh gives solid support as Ginsberg's unhinged mother.The director and cinematographer have opted for a kind of Eastmancolor autumnal texture to evoke the era, like the GODFATHERS. The texture and the erratic pace make for a movie that's hard to get into. By the end I was wondering how authentic the story was; an air of contrivance hangs over it. If Radcliffe goes on to Brandoesque greatness, this will perhaps be looked on as his STREETCAR, his WATERFRONT. We must wait and see.",Kill Your Darlings
36,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Unsteady Beat,4,20 November 2013,"College professor David Kammerer was the buzzkill/albatross of the Beat Generation, that small group of bohemian writers who, during the 1940's, began what would change literature while incipiently shaping the pivotal hippie era and, well, the rest is history Kammerer's adoration for young pretty boy Lucien Carr, and the murder that resulted, is covered in several Jack Kerouac novels including VANITY OF DOLUOZ, DESOLATION ANGELS and even his first venture, TOWN AND THE CITY But the main character is poet Allen Ginsberg, equal to Jack in the Beat template along with the strange, mythical William Burroughs Young HARRY POTTER icon Daniel Radcliffe plays Ginsberg with the kind of sympathetic pathos begging for a transformation: in this case, drug-use leading to writing leading to homosexuality But we're skipping ahead When Allen first escapes his crazy mother and becomes a Columbia University freshman, he's somewhat of an empty canvas Enter Dane DeHaan as Lucian Carr, an elfin, blond-haired/blue-eyed contemplating beatnik before there was such a thing Despite being the poster child for cerebral pretentiousness, Carr becomes an instigative mentor to Ginsberg The more interesting scenes have the duo clashing with the uptight status quo while discovering drugs, jazz and planning a foundational ""New Vision"" to put the older poets (ala Ogden Nash) to rest And, like the sound of an orchestra tuning, there's only an eerie squeezebox of intention sans the necessary talent to progress their (at that point) lofty ideals Legendary author Jack Kerouac, whose ON THE ROAD – along with Ginsberg's epic poem HOWL – ignited the Beat Generation, is a third-fiddle womanizer and the least important here Meanwhile, a lanky Burroughs mumbles through experimental drug trips and the character that should have been more prominent is Kammerer himself, the bearded college professor played by DEXTER star Michael C. Hall With only a sporadic dash of scenes, mostly involving Kammerer desperately hounding Lucien while a peripheral friendship/romance with Ginsberg blossoms, he serves more as a distraction than an essential catalyst... treated like a special guest star throughout.What's ironic is the Kammerer/Carr case slowed down the spontaneity of the Kerouac novels, and amounts to little here The real purpose of KILL YOUR DARLINGS is Carr's hypocrisy countered by Ginsberg's realization as a homosexual morphing into a significant generational spokesman And in that, Radcliffe's edgy demeanor exceeds a visually pleasing but ultimately monotone story, rushing through what's really important: the collaborating genius between the three primary BeatsInstead we're left with a cinematic version of Ginsberg and Carr's grandiloquent NEW VISION A potential spark without any real burn.",Kill Your Darlings
37,pfgpowell-1,"Oddly bloodless, but some might well like it",6,10 December 2015,"The best thought this is 'absolutely amazing' and the worst that 'on so many different levels, this movie is stupendously awful'. Actually it is - in my view, at least - neither. The thought occurs to me that, for whatever reason the sum of the parts don't quite add up to a whole. Kill Your Darlings is oddly bloodless and bland, which is something of an irony given that it ends with the stabbing and drowning of one of the characters.Part of the problem for John Krokidas is that one of the central elements of his piece, the Beat Generation and its various protagonists - including Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsburg and William Burroughs - are of rather less consequence in the second decade of 21st century than many, not least the Beat Generation, would like. OK, so they caused something of a stir in the Fifties and kicked over the traces in a safe Western world which preferred domesticity and calm after the torrid time of World War II, but quite soon the real next generation came along, the baby boomers, grabbing far more attention and rather tactlessly shuffling the Beats off-stage.Then there is the work of the Beats. You might rate it, but from what I have read, it is all rather silly and trivial. Rebelling against contemporary conformity was their main interest - when is it not for a young generation? - but the poems and prose pieces - or at least those Krokidas chose to include in his film - are pretty trivial, silly and often quite bad. (Truman Capote, who could write, dismissed On The Road, Kerouac's alleged masterpiece as 'that's not writing, that's typing'. Read it, or some of it, then read some of Capote's work. I think you'll be inclined to agree with the little monster.)\The pieces of Ginsburg poetry we were presented with sound no more significant than all other trite juvenilia I've come across (including my own). It's one thing to stick out your tongue at your elders, pulls faces and proclaim you are different, but quite another to leave behind a body of work of real substance.So Krokidas had - has - problem. Anther difficulty is that, despite tremendous performances all round, none of the characters is particularly likable. We don't really care about any of them (except perhaps Ginsburg's mother).Amazing? Stupendously awful? Not at all. Kill Your Darlings is a well-made, engaging film, but it rather limps where it should at times sprint. But certainly worth a 6.",Kill Your Darlings
38,shawneofthedead,"It may skip a couple of beats, but this is still a pretty great number.",8,11 March 2014,"Typically, coming-of-age stories unfold in a predictable fashion: kid tentatively ventures into the world beyond the one he knows, where he encounters people and things that will change him and his outlook on life forever. It would be easy to dismiss Kill Your Darlings as yet another entry in a tired genre: the tale of a poet who finds his voice through a heady cocktail of sex, drugs and college. But John Krokidas' debut feature film, which takes as its subjects the American poets of the revolutionary Beat Generation, fits in so much more, as it explores a haunting search for life and legacy that teeters close to the edge of death.Allen Ginsberg (Daniel Radcliffe) arrives at Columbia University keen to start a life away from the shadow of his famous dad, poet Louis Ginsberg (David Cross), and his mentally unstable mother (Jennifer Jason Leigh). He meets the electrifying Lucien Carr (Dane DeHaan), a rebel radiating so much charisma and ambition that it's easy to forget his lack of actual talent. Lucien brings together the aspiring artists who will soon come to change the literary world with their words: Allen, William S. Burroughs (Ben Foster) and Jack Kerouac (Jack Huston). As their lives intersect, their destinies intertwine, tangled up in the form of David Kammerer (Michael C. Hall), a man hopelessly caught in Lucien's enthralling spell.Krokidas keeps this fascinating brew of hormones, hope and horror bubbling throughout, effectively nailing the champagne fizz of youth: a time when you could do ridiculous things, and remember them as romantic and revolutionary. Allen yearns, Jack drinks, William sucks nitrous oxide into his lungs in a bathtub, and Lucien keeps them all spinning. You don't have to know the Beat poets or their work to recognise the fire burning in these young men. Slicing and dicing pages of old classics, the boys make their manifesto quite literal: they will not rely on or succumb to tradition; their work will be conscribed by neither rhyme nor meter.The most intriguing thing about Kill Your Darlings is that it refuses to romanticise this budding intellectual movement. The Beat poets may have become the idols of literary hipsters everywhere, but Krokidas takes care to tuck their ingenuity and creativity into the recognisable rhythms of everyday life. Desperate to hang onto Lucien's interest, Allen practically stumbles into his own talent. To create magic, he jerks off in front of his typewriter, or stupidly ties a noose around his neck to come a little closer to death. These young men, Krokidas seems to be saying, are treading a fine line between inspiration and tomfoolery. It's only when Allen recites a poem - on a moonlit night, on a stolen boat - that Lucien is comprehensively struck by his genius, as are we.When the film spins into darker, more murderous territory, it moves from coming-of-age story to crime thriller - a genre shift that, oddly, works quite well within the universe established by Krokidas, as it allows Allen to contemplate the darker, less palatable side of Lucien's volatile personality. But it also becomes that much harder to separate the facts of these characters from Krokidas' fiction. David's tragic obsession with Lucien - one that the film suggests Allen could have shared - finally kicks off a tragic twist of events that unfold in a very particular way in Kill Your Darlings. Arguably, Allen ends up in an emotional place in the film that doesn't quite sit right with what actually transpired in real life, as told to us by a series of title cards just before the end credits.Less controversial is the young cast, all of whom do first-rate work in disentangling the complex web of relationships that exists amongst these characters. Radcliffe is still a mite stiff as an actor, but this is his best on-screen performance yet: brave, bold, and proof that he's willing to challenge anyone's ideas of what he can do on screen. DeHaan is a firecracker as the capricious Lucien, burning so brightly that it's no wonder the other characters can't tear themselves away from him. Hall gets to sound a note of quiet desolation as David, whose infatuation isn't played simply as the unrequited lust of a madman. Only Elizabeth Olsen - as Jack's long-suffering girlfriend - is called upon to play a stereotype.All in all, Kill Your Darlings marks an impressive debut for Krokidas. Shaken and stirred with a gloriously jazzy soundtrack and a colour palette that shifts from light to murky in a heartbeat, the film practically radiates tension both sexual and intellectual. It might have a little trouble with the facts of the matter, but, taken on its own merits, this is a smart, intoxicating look at how adolescent dreams must necessarily give way to the chilling bite of reality.",Kill Your Darlings
39,doug_park2001,"""Find where love hides--Live, share, lose""",9,20 March 2014,"{8.5 stars} First off, I'm sure that there are discrepancies between this film and the real story of the Columbia University love-triangle of Allen Ginsburg, Lucien Carr, and David Kammerer. I'm judging KILL YOUR DARLINGS according to story-value, not historical accuracy.KILL YOUR DARLINGS is generally well-filmed and well-played, and Daniel Radcliffe is especially memorable as the young Allen Ginsburg, so different in many ways from the one we knew later. It shows a great deal about how he was influenced and changed by the early Columbia ""Beat"" circle of Burroughs, Kerouac, and others such as Carr whose names, for various reasons, have been largely forgotten. It realistically evokes the 1940s, and the story of WWII is skillfully paralleled with that of the young writers' circle. Their college-boy pretensions, which, nevertheless, have real sincerity behind them, also shine through very well. Coincidentally, it's intriguing to see the horribly inconsistent laws regarding homosexuals, as well as the amount of ""in loco parentis"" control universities wielded at the time.Not to sound snooty, but one needs some basic familiarity with the major literary characters and the Beat movement in general in order to really appreciate and enjoy this film. Those who aren't into fiction and poetry of the sort written by these characters may be rather bored with KILL YOUR DARLINGS. Otherwise, while there are a few patchy spots, the whole tale of the antics, jealousies, and everything else that happens in the young libertine writers' circle, ending with a murder and the dilemmas that follow, makes for a gripping and very intelligent movie.",Kill Your Darlings

As someone who has never watched any of the Happy Potter films, I must say that I am surprised by the role of the main character in a positive way. Actually, this may very well be my first movie of him.The fact that it is based on the true story made the film more appealing to me as I enjoy true stories on the big screen.The movie as a whole is interesting and I did not find it boring.

1. The costume and set design is amazing as it not only helps to create the 1940's world, but it also emphasises the differing character personalities.
2. The soundtrack is bubbly and lively which allows for the film to come to life, especially in the action sequences.
3. Both Daniel Radcliffe (Allen Ginsberg) and Dane DeHaan (Lucien Carr) deliver incredible performances.
4. There are also brilliant side performances from Michael C. Hall (David Kammerer), Jack Huston (Jack Kerouac), Ben Foster (William Burroughs) and Elizabeth Olsen (Edie Parker).
5. The cinematography is beautiful. It provides gorgeous shots as well as concocting an intense and personalised feel.Cons:
1. There are certain sub-plots that are raised and either, forgotten about, or hastily and sloppily concluded. For example, Allen Ginsberg's mother being insane at the beginning, but getting magically fixed at the end.
2. The character of Lucien Carr is rather one-dimensional so it's hard to warm to him.
3. Some of the characters, for example Jack Kerouac and William Burroughs, are given barely anything to do yet they get a lot of screen-time.
4. Daniel Radcliffe's American accent is clearly forced.
5. The second act somewhat drifts unfocused until the third act arrives and the plot tightens up again.
6. The romance between Allen Ginsberg and Lucien Carr is severely underdeveloped, so the drama that stems from it never feels that genuine.",Kill Your Darlings
42,lucasnochez,Review: Kill Your Darlings/Night Film Reviews www.nightfilmreviews.com,6,1 December 2013,"It's no surprise that some of the most effective works of the Beatnik generation were born in the scuzzy halls of jazz bars; soaked with whiskey induced grammar, intoxicated with muddled philosophies, their pages bathed in the permanent smell of tobacco. Much like the work of Lewis Carroll, drugs, alcohol, and culture were catalysts towards the ideology of destroying the old and building the new. The movement itself was a rousing feat with great cultural ramifications. The film itself is a work that sometimes trades in the grainy for flashy; rupturing not only the pattern that the authors were trying to break, but the whole tone of the film as well.If I pitched you a story about the Beat generation led by Harry Potter, the new Harry Osborne, a guy from X-Men and the guy from Boardwalk Empire with half his face missing, I'm sure the reaction would be pretty great. Unfortunately for audiences, the subject matter submits to a truly unauthentic, lack lustre festival formula and abandons creativeness and a unique vision for a familiar narrative that disregards great historical figures, making them caricatures within a lame murder/mystery genre film.Daniel Radcliffe plays Allen Ginsberg, one of the most famous and recognizable poets in the American culture. Radcliffe continues to shed his 'Hogwarts alumni' image by taking risky, unconventional and edgy roles that all share in their seemingly controversial nature. Upon his acceptance and arrival into Columbia University, Ginsberg is in search of something offbeat. Ironically enough, Ginsberg is lured into the residency of Lucien Carr (Dane DeHaan), an intoxicated sociopath with an obsession for self-destruction, always curious for the taste of the complicated and unexplainable.Together, Carr and Ginsberg start a small revolution in their heads, but without so many words. With the help of an unlimited supply of cannabis and some Johnny Walker, the two eventually enlist of the help of William Burroughs (Ben Foster) and a young Jack Kerouac (Jack Huston) and begin their uprising. Through constant disruptions by the reputation and prestige Columbia University holds so true and dear to its heart, the constantly stoned literary bandits are engulfed into a world of lovers, obsession and murder, intent on revolutionizing literature.Kill Your Darlings starts bold and overwhelming, demanding utmost attention. Unfortunately, once attention is given, the film cannot hold its grip and deliver a rousing, culturally relevant story about some of the most influential figures in contemporary literature in the last century. Blending the lines of drug induced fantasy and reality, Kill Your Darlings is a story of breaking the formulaic path, distrusting all conventional and predictable beats of rhyme and meter, but sadly becomes a textbook festival entry with a forgettable conclusion.The term to 'kill your darlings' is one that suggests destroying all the conventions and comforts of the mundane, reinventing yourself, and throwing inhibition to the wind and finding creativity will inspire instances of utter uniqueness. Kill Your Darlings, although sometimes confident, is an obsessive and complicated re-telling of enigmatic characters placed in a deceitful and over-dramatized tragedy of murder. With the rich historical and cultural imprint of these feisty literary pioneers, so much of the busy murder antics is clearly overshadowing the brilliant opportunity to showcase the likes of Carr, Ginsberg, Burroughs and Kerouac.Mixing the potential monologue moments of Weir's 1989 Dead Poets Society with the tone and ambiance of Salle's 2004 masterpiece The Motorcycle Diaries, Kill Your Darlings becomes a self- inflicted suicide of a film with a tantalizing and promising narrative. Don't get me wrong, the performances are top notch; DeHaan is magnificent as Carr and Radcliffe is radiant as Ginsberg. However, while most of the top-billed cast is ravishing, and supporting cast is spot on, the film feels drowned in the water with average narrative clichés weighing it down.While the antics of the underbelly of the New York Greenwich Village scene have been explored, battered, bruised and forever changed by the provocative and decadent Beat Movement, Kill Your Darlings remains a tame snippet of the life of these amazing authors and thinkers. Destined to be an example of a complicated festival biography attempt, the film will positively spark deep discussion. Kill Your Darlings repeats the initial reaction to Carr's response to Ginsberg's complicated life, ""Perfect. I love complicated."" Hopefully next time, an autobiographical cinematic take on the origins of the Beat Generation will be less gimmicky and more focused on the howling affect these fascinating individuals had on the world of literature, art, and our contemporary culture as a whole.",Kill Your Darlings
43,bob_bear,There are better songs worth singing...,5,12 July 2014,"I watched this with a gay friend. At the end of which, I asked him what he thought of it? He hated it, he said. When I asked why, he said because it simply reinforces prejudice -- the misguided belief that gay people are sick, dysfunctional and/or psychotic. He is utterly fed up with seeing gay people portrayed this way, he said, and that there are better songs worth singing. I can see his point.As someone who was into the Beats in my University days – not so much for their literary output as for their legend - I always felt that Ginsberg came across as a rather unattractive, libertine, amoral, corruptive, twerp. Daniel Radcliffe gives him a goody two-shoes makeover. The physical casting overall is good – except for Jack Huston as Jack Kerouac. He lacks the looks, charisma and sensitive masculinity that made Kerouac an Icon. Major fail.Radcliffe's Ginsberg is like an innocent abroad who falls into a life of drug addled debauchery whilst remaining doe-eyed and strangely incorruptible. If I didn't know the story better, I might have bought it. Such is the power of Danny's wholesomeness.In the final analysis, I reference my friend again. How many out of ten would he give it?

46,Barev2013,Respectable effort not quite up to the inherent interest of the subject matter,6,8 April 2015,"image2.jpegViewed at Jameson Cinefest in Miskolc Hungary, September 2013, a modest festival in a secondary city that has now become the most important film festival in the country and growing steadily with unusual heads up programming. KYD, the debut feature by 29 year old director John Krokidas, is a dope fueled coming of age story of soon-to-be literary celebrities before they became notoriously well known which then turns into a more than routine crime thriller. The murder of a homosexual older man in 1944 draws together the great poets of the beat generation: Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac and William Burroughs during their college campus years at Columbia. With Dan Radcliffe as Ginsberg, Dane DeHaan as Lucien Carr, and English actor Jack Huston as Jack Kerouac, and a cameo by Jennifer Jason Leigh (49) as Ginsberg's mentally ill Jewish mother. The ingredients for a fascinating film are all there but ""Kill your Darlings"" Is the kind of dismemorable title that can kill a picture before it starts. The packed auditorium where I saw it indicated a strong advance curiosity quotient reflecting the high level of literary awareness of Hungarian filmgoers, but it left me cold. While these were the literary icons of my own college days (I even met Ginsberg in person several times) and this is a period of high personal interest for me, I felt no sense of authenticity or real resonance with Theophrastus L WW II period. Above all the central Ginsberg portrayal was way off in my view and not at all true to life -- true, perhaps, to current screen life since the main actor, Daniel Radcliffe, (as Ginsberg) is an international celebrity because of his lead roles in the Harry Potter films,but painfully miscast hero. A little too canny for its own good this respectable first effort will only get a limited release because it is far more neo-intellectual than mainstream, and will probably disappear from view quickly. For the record the story deals with Ginsberg's short stay at Columbia University in 1944 where he meets his first important gay lover, the oh-so-hip Lucien Carr. Carr introduces him to his buddies future Beat Generation celebrities Jack Kerouac and William Boroughs, neither very believably portrayed, and then accidentally kills one of his other lovers, the middle aged David Kammerer, while trying to ward off undesired sexual advances. (Sample dialog: Carr: ""I was a kid, and you dragged me into your perverted mess. Kammerer: ""How can you say that? You know that's not true. I will never give up on us. Carr: ""You're pathetic! ~ and stabs him with a pocket knife) Whike there are some references to the early writing of Ginsberg and Kerouac this picture deals mostly with the involvement of the future literary icons in this little known fait divers, which was briefly big news at the time, but was never referred to in their later writings. Nice try, better luck next time.😜",Kill Your Darlings
47,hughman55,Kill this movie...,1,23 April 2016,"Well, how ironic that a film based on the giants of the Beat Generation, the literary revolution that cleaved the 20th Century in half, would collapse under the weight of a badly written, two dimensional, screenplay. There is no shortage of compelling story lines involving the writers who led this revolution; Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, Lucien Carr, or William S. Burroughs (murdered his wife playing William Tell with a bow and arrow and got a way with it, oops).The storyline they chose was the murder committed by Lucien Carr where he stabbed and drown a former lover, David Kammerer. There should be plenty to work with here. But rather than focusing the 90 minutes of screen time on developing anything meaningful about the literary movement, the murder, the murderer, or the victim, we're instead shown snapshots of those things, plus Allen's mentally disturbed mother, Lucien's overly involved mother, a prank they commit at the library on the Columbia University campus, Jack Kerouac's complicated personal life, university stuff, other stuff, and then more stuff. The context in which this murder occurs, and the literary revolution, is everywhere, and nowhere. And in the end you could care less about any of them or what they did.I recall hearing a lot about this film while it was in production. The hype was intense because of the real life characters, what they did, and who was playing them. I do not recall the film ever being released. Perhaps it was. But it just seemed to disappear quietly and was forgotten. I saw something about it years later somewhere and thought to myself, ""Oh yeah, that. Wonder what happened to that film."" After purchasing the DVD and watching it, it is easy to see why it was smothered in its crib and buried in the backyard. Which is a shame because the story is there, some of the acting is quite good, but none of that can, or ever will, overcome bad writing. Which was kind of the point of the Beat Generation to begin with. If you can see it for free and have nothing better to do with 90 minutes of your life it won't kill you to watch it. It won't give you any enjoyment either.",Kill Your Darlings

Sometime during the Harry Potter series Daniel Radcliffe learned how to act and he's excellent here as Ginsberg. Similarly Dane DeHaan, who I did not enjoy at all in Valerian, delivers a subtle and powerful turn as Allen's friend Lucien. I could go through everyone in this movie but other standouts are David Cross, Ben Foster and Jack Huston.The cinematography and set design was excellent which made it feel like that time period. The musical choices are probably my only gripe about this movie. Set in the 40s so most of the music is jazz and some orchestral pieces. But there are a few important moments when modern music plays that I found a bit jarring and out of place. I think there's a TV on the Radio song and also a Bloc Party song. I just didn't understand their place in an otherwise tonally consistent film.Overall it's worth seeing for the performances and the story is simple enough but quite good. It's also paced quite well so despite being a bit longer than Howl felt way shorter.",Kill Your Darlings

The acting was on par with the theme of the film, Dane DeHaan and Daniel Radcliffe, in particular, doing a fantastic job.
The film debates topics such as sexual repression, recognition, reputation and exploration. As with most artists, the members of the Beat Generation certainly had a tumultuous and troublesome lifestyle that is depicted in the movie through love triangles, extravagant parties and misdemeanors.The film's screenplay started off well, describing Ginsberg's freshman experience at college, meeting with DeHaan's character, Lucien Carr, and surely enough the first steps of beat poetry were about to begin. However halfway through the script looses focus and ultimately doesn't lead up to anything, leaving the viewer with not much factual information about the great poetry generation.""Kill Your Darlings"" had substantial background information that could have been put to more use while still being captivating to the audience.",Kill Your Darlings

I am a homosexual and I did enjoy this one tremendously. Not in so many films that homosexuality serves only as an undertone, despite some visualized images of homosexual lovemaking. Absolute love of freedom becomes the overriding theme of this bunch of homosexual artists. I think this film will get all of us closer to a natural treatment of the third sex. Homosexuals would be equaled to heterosexuals when their ""issue"" ceases to be an issue for the public at large. The film is not trying to tell the whole story of these artists. Just a very thin slice was chosen to be told, and what a slice it was. My country, Thailand, is still stuck with the 18th Century superhuman theory of politics. All moral codes are determined by how much you love and glorify the king. Nothing else really matters. Even a murder is construed by law as being better than libeling the king, his family members, and his men. So I understand how it feels to be so free, and be met with ultra-conservatism at times. Madness can come as a result of being free, but the lack of it would drive you insane. Quite a different of psychological episodes. I encourage you to watch this film and do more research about these characters. You will end up knowing a lot more about yourself.",Kill Your Darlings

We are given the impression the catalyst for this literary movement was not the writers themselves, but their muse: a charismatic, volatile, rich young ne'er-do-well and his headline-grabbing crime of passion murder, for whom they were all willing accessories or enablers. Based in history but of course with liberties taken, the film offers a useful summary of the personalities and the time. The performances are believable, the script intelligent. But the film feels thin, reductive, and lacks the kind of depth and texture that would tell us something we don't already know about this fascinating subject. It's like a student film -- all earnestness, all literalness; little humor, little insight.

55,CharlieGreenCG,Fantastic!,9,31 December 2013,"Passionate, elegant and simply stunning. Kill Your Darlings, directed by John Krokidas, was a wondering viewing experience - bringing us right back to the stylish 1940's era. The narrative to the film however cannot be completely explained without doing the film some injustice, taking away from the deep character relationship. But it simply follows a young freshman, Allen Ginsberg (Daniel Radcliffe), as he enters a poet literary movement following the few concepts of sex, drugs, alcohol and murder.By this point you are surely thinking - 'I don't like poetry and I have never heard of these poets!' - but that is okay, as the film is so much more than that. Especially from its romantic angle, showing us an emotional narrative that simply thrives the film into complete biopic freshness.Director John Krokidas explained that the film was over ten years in the making, which is reflected on screen in terms of the fundamental making, research and sound. That, with the mix of visionary direction, beautiful sepia cinematography and stellar cast creates something special. The opening flash-back sequence in fact shows an excellent homage to the 1944 Double Indemnity - which is quite fantastically shown.Starring as the main cast is Daniel Radcliffe, Dane DeHaan, Ben Foster and Michael C. Hall (whose brilliant!). The main story though is caught between DeHaan and Radcliffe who show an unparalleled chemistry both visually and emotionally. Not just an on screen comic relationship like we see over and over. Wahlberg and Washington in 2 Guns anybody? But the jokes pulled by DeHaan and Radcliffe on screen are worth it and will easily pull a smile. Radcliffe, who is the gossip of the film for his featured gay scene is simply superb, showing what is probably his best performance to date, post Harry Potter career.",Kill Your Darlings

Little to no conflict one can care about - Kammerer just pops in and out of the narrative, which can't sustain any sense of tension between him and Carr, or Ginsberg. The central figures of Burroughs, Ginsberg, Kerouac, and Carr come across as shallow and self-absorbed. Perhaps at that young age they were, but that doesn't make for compelling drama. And the montage surrounding the murder, with its heavy-handed penetration imagery, is so over-the-top obvious to be almost ridiculous. The cinematography is just ugly - I realize the lighting, color palette etc. were deliberate artistic choices, but it still looks unappealing. The actors do a good job with what they are given (Foster as Burroughs is especially good, capturing his cadence, inflection, and mannerisms without descending into mimicry), but overall the film is unfocused, slack, and unpleasant.",Kill Your Darlings
57,lukehere99,And I thought this was going to be good...,5,16 March 2014,"Kill Your Darlings had a surprisingly low level of hype for a movie which was really the first wide release project (not counting The Woman In Black) starring Daniel Radcliffe after the hugely popular Harry Potter franchise ended. Regrettably Kill Your Darlings is just another clichéd jazzy 1940's movie. So jazzy in fact that the repetitive soundtrack played to almost everything started to get on my nerves. I understand that it is based on a true story and Alan Ginsberg was a very fancy and intelligent poet, but the plot did not interest me one bit. Occasionally Radcliffe will stare at DeHaan (who is just as brilliant as ever) in longing and inspire a slight chuckle from me. Unfortunately these occasional moments of unintentional humour did not make the movie enjoyable in a so bad it's good way, like The Room, The Wicker Man or Troll 2, and Kill Your Darlings was not just clichéd and uninteresting but very very boring. My attention was gone from the movie after about 20 minutes, of course it came back for a few minutes in the blow job scene, then went again and I returned to finding everything around me more interesting. Somebody is killed and someone else is put in jail towards the end and I had no idea who the corpse was. This is coming from the guy who sat through Cloud Atlas attentively for 3 hours, Kill Your Darlings is boring, clichéd, uninteresting, weakly written and in places slightly amusing. You have probably guessed that I didn't enjoy it.",Kill Your Darlings

The revelation of his true role in the story is a bit of a shocker, there was always something a bit off about Lucien but I never really thought of that. Daniel Radcliffe continues to prove why he is far superior to such roles as Harry Potter, he truly has found his feet as an actor in his own right. It's a riveting and well paced film with a very fine and wrenching finish. I also kinda loved the modern-esque feel of the film, the 1940's backdrop did not always match the soundtrack which had a far more modern turn to it at times. This appealed to my cookiness and fitted very well with the film to give it a unique style of it's own. Bravo to all concerned.",Kill Your Darlings
59,bluerider521,Cherish Your Darlings,6,29 November 2013,"Allen Ginsberg, who has no thoughts of writing poetry, leaves a very troubled New Jersey family to go to Columbia. There he comes of age artistically and sexually. He meets the later day Beats, all of them relentlessly displaying the signature behaviors which would later make them infamous They all frolic around.. The seeds of a movement are sown. Kind of an old movie plot: Andy Hardy with sex, drugs, jazz and a crazy mother.Poor America has no poetry but the doggerel of Ogden Nash, the film says, ignoring the contemporary modernist poetry of Wallace Stevens and William Carlos Williams. Thus, Ginsburg, it says, rose as a unique pioneer poet from the miasma of jazz, drugs, avant garde friends and almost out of the closet homosexuality to which he was introduced.. The film is much too simplistic to be taken as a consequential story of the creation of the Beat Movement. Women are treated badly in the few moments they appear, and Ginsberg is reduced to a mere observer for some periods of time Then there is a killing. Things get muddled. Very muddled. Ginsberg who was in no way involved tries to help out and is castigated and rejected. We don't know why. Everybody goes their own way. End of story. All of these diverse elements do not add up to a coherent story.. The script writers have included too many of their ""darlings"" at the expense of cohesiveness.I can't see how this would be of interest to anyone not fascinated by, and knowledgeable about, the Beat Movement.

60,HerbsReviews,Coming-Of-Age Blackhole,4,1 April 2014,"""Another lover hits the universe. The circle is broken. But with death comes rebirth. And like all lovers and sad people, I am a poet.""Typically, coming-of-age stories unfold in a predictable fashion: the youth tentatively ventures into the world beyond the one he knows, where he encounters people and things that will change him and his outlook on life forever. It would be easy to dismiss Kill Your Darlings as yet another entry in a tired genre.The premise revolves around Allen Ginsberg (Radcliffe) who arrives at Columbia University keen to start a life away from the shadow of his famous dad, poet Louis Ginsberg (Cross), and his mentally unstable mother (Leigh). He meets the electrifying Lucien Carr (DeHaan), a rebel radiating so much charisma and ambition that it's easy to forget his lack of actual talent. Lucien brings together the aspiring artists who will soon come to change the literary world with their words: Allen, William and Jack. As their lives intersect, their destinies intertwine, tangled up in the form of David Kammerer, a man hopelessly caught in Lucien's enthralling spell.The whole idea of the beat generation was that if you could dismantle the structure of communication and still have some worth then anything was up for grabs. If poetry could give up rhyme and still have substance, then sex could give up its hetero prefix and still have love, and society could give up its mores and still find order. To such a message, the dull and plodding structure of standard film school does no homage. Nor do the film makers even seem aware of the message of the beat generation, putting in scenes of jazz, sex, drugs, and English class without seeming to understand their inter-relationships.Radcliffe continues to she his ""Hogwarts alumni"" image by taking risky, unconventional and edgy roles that all share in their seemingly controversial nature. The film starts out bold and overwhelming, demanding utmost attention. Unfortunately, once attention is given, the film cannot hold its grip and deliver a rousing culturally relevant story about some of the most influential figures in contemporary literature in the last century. DeHaan is a firecracker as the capricious Lucien, burning so brightly that it's no wonder the other characters can't tear themselves away from him. Hall gets to sound a note of quiet desolation as David, whose infatuation isn't played simply as the unrequited madman. Only Elizabeth Olsen - as Jack's long- suffering girlfriend- is called upon to play a stereotype.What's ironic is the Kammerer/Carr case slowed down the spontaneity of the Kerouac novels, and amounts so lithe here... The real purpose of KILL YOUR DARLINGS is Carr's hypocrisy countered by Ginsberg's realization as a homosexual morphing into a significant generational spokesman... And in that, Radcliffe's edgy demeanor exceeds a visually pleasing but ultimately monotone story, rushing through what's really important: the collaborating genius between the three primary Beats. For these reasons Kill Your Darlings gets a 4/10.",Kill Your Darlings

However, KYD will most likely touch you in some deep place if, like me, you enjoy black comedy, rebellion, and wannabe revolutionaries.

But, coming to the point, I loved the movie. Even though it might not have been what I expected, I was so drawn by the amazing acting-skills that both Daniel Radcliff and Dane Dehaan showed in this movie. The characters they played were full of passion, drive, confusion, love and hate. Dane Dehaan (plays Lucian Carr) did an amazing job playing this rebellious young man, who is so full of hate for himself, and who has had a difficult life. He is able to play a character who hides his real emotion behind a fake emotion. I am not sure how he is capable of it, but he sure can. The movie it self is very honest and rough. When you follow artists you normally see a part of a society, that you normally never see and it is quite interesting to follow these people and their story.

63,maksim_nikiforovski,"A clichéd, stylish, romanticized coming-of-age story...",7,28 August 2016,"This is one of those movies that really is what you think it is. One of those generic Hollywood coming-of-age stories that masquerades under the guise of a true story.We can't know how the real poets looked like and behaved during their time in Columbia, but they certainly didn't looked so damn stylish and polished as they look in this movie. Everything is very very fake, the hairstyles, the lavish rooms, the flamboyant clothes, the exorbitant lifestyle, and the characters dancing on modern rock songs.The film is a mess.It starts very stylishly with poetic quotes, and posh aesthetics. The scenes are really glossed and polished, everything seems to be working well, up to the point when the film realizes that beneath the facade there has to be some substance, a plot that drives the action. And suddenly in the third act, so to speak, a murder takes place, one as messy as the film. Suddenly characters start to show motivations and characteristics that weren't previously established.The film focuses on Allen Ginsberg and Lucien Carr, but somewhere in between William Burroughs and Jack Kerouac are thrown in, and the viewers are supposed to react to them based on their knowledge on the people they are based on.Daniel Radcliffe's performance is as wooden as his Harry Potter's, at least his American accent is decent. If one is knowledgeable about films in general, one would realize that the direction and editing do the job for Daniel, the director knew where to cut and where to move the camera from Daniel. Ben Foster shines, while Michael C. Hall is not given the material he needs.

The music is played at a ridiculously LOUD volume, which slams the viewer (listener) suddenly, for no reason whatsoever. It's just one of several examples of a surprisingly poorly made movie. No, this is not a 'film'.The writing and acting are perfectly appropriate for the young kids who think they have discovered the angst of life like no one ever has before them.This is a very shallow depiction of the self-aggrandizement that the Beats built their 'revolution' on. The script is as shallow as the Beats were ultimately shown to be - as most readers and devotees come around to realize. For the most part, they were entitled little rich brats who indulged and were indulged. The acting, then, is constrained by the writing: complete absence of subtlety or nuance; no restraint; no pacing; clichéd and stereotyped - like watching a junior-high-school play rehearsal.There are no surprises here. You watch, waiting for something to build to something - anything. There is no examination of these characters or any historical or socio-economic context, just the assumption that they are smart, insightful, and 'right'. The movie is based on stupid assumptions.Perhaps the problem with this movie is, after all, the material. But, no, it just really is a very bad movie.

But, I do know this is dreadful.",Kill Your Darlings
66,soerenbruns,Not Offbeat Enough,5,8 February 2017,"The overall solid, but ultimately mediocre ""Kill Your Darlings"" reveals its key problem at the very beginning. We see a dead body held by a character suggesting that some sort of murder will play a central role in the film. Hence, we will end up watching a crime drama. The problem is that the moment the story turns in that direction, the film loses its focus. But first we are introduced to the very young Allen Ginsberg (Daniel Radcliffe) who enrols in college where he meets the very young Lucien Carr (Dane DeHaan), William Burroughs (Ben Foster) and eventually Jack Kerouac (Jack Huston). The first half of the film revolves around their frustrations with the conventions of poetry and literature they are taught at Columbia. The professors insist on strict rules one has to apply so that ""creation equals imitation"" . They are disgusted by the fetishisation of rhyme and metre. Inspired by poets as Yates and Whitman, they decide to write a manifesto propagating free expression of the self without any boundaries as writing's highest virtue, resulting in acts of disobedience like replacing several ""high works"" in the library for example the original version of Beowulf with works of personal role models like Melville. For that part of the film, ""Kill Your Darlings"" is a fairly engaging if all too standard period piece that checks every box with vivid jazz music, smoking in bars,emphasis on old-fashion dressing styles and technology as record players and scratchy radio sound while it is at the same time a depiction of a group of idealistic artists with the expected scenes of alcohol and drug abuse, hectic writing on a typewriter and the rebellion against authority figures like the professors. This is fine, even though one cannot help but feel that a depiction of these artists in their prime would maybe make the more interesting film. But if we perceive them as the literary Avengers, than this has to be considered their origin story. As already mentioned, the turning point where the film really loses momentum is marked by the murder of David Kammerer (David C. Hall) a dubious mentor-like figure for Lucien Carr. Here the standard period piece with interesting central characters becomes an even more standard crime story/court drama, where the characters' appeal dissolves in the genre's basic themes of rage, revenge and guilt. From that point on, it does not really matter that we are dealing with literary geniuses. Sure, this story is part of their life. But if you decide to make a movie about Allan Ginsberg, William Burroughs and Jack Kerouac, do you really need to focus on a gloomy murder story that we have seen so many times before with the only difference being that these characters incidentally have changed the literary landscape of the second half of the twentieth century? For what it's worth, you could place those characters in a bar having them smoking, drinking and discussing art for two hours and you could end up with an engaging piece of film that truly explores the workings of these characters' minds. It definitely would be more ingenious than what we witness here. Many have pointed out the film's central contradiction of depicting people that think in a very unconventional manner with quite conventional means. At least, the actors try their best to bring the artists' unique approach not only to literature but to life in general to the screen. Daniel Radcliffe does a good job at playing the very introvert Ginsberg at the start of his studies who eventually breaks more and more out of his shell and seems to experience what it means to be alive for the first time. It is unfortunate that Ginsberg had a thing for those round spectacles which are quite iconic but also unmistakably reminiscent of a certain young wizard. All the more surprising then, how strikingly Radcliffe shakes this notion off and manages to portray Ginsberg in a convincing manner. The same is true for the central performances of DeHaan, Foster and Huston who individually bring the antics of their quite eccentric characters to life without overdoing it (especially Foster balances on a tightrope here) and collectively have a vivid chemistry between them. They are surrounded by a decent supporting cast with David Cross, the always welcome Elizabeth Olsen and a small but noticeable part by Jennifer Jason Leigh. Given that everything about this movie is fairly run-of-the-mill, the at times odd choice of music seems like a slightly desperate attempt to appear unorthodox. Apart from the aforementioned use of Jazz as a time marker we hear some anachronistic pieces of post-punk that kind of fit the scenery, but also one song in particular that completely kills the mood which is the (normally delightful) ""Don't Look Back Into the Sun"" by the Libertines. It plays over the end credits. Soundaestethically it completely counters everything we have just seen and heard before, which is somewhat reminiscent of the infamous ""Goodfellas"" end credits which I also have never been a big fan of, but whose moment of surprise I can acknowledge. This is just trying too hard. Where ""Marie Antoinette"" fails to follow up the snotty ""Natural's Not in It"" of the opening credits, ""Kill Your Darlings"" ends on a very rousing note while both movies deliver a very tame rendition of their real characters' astonishing lives. In both cases the choice of music may reveal that the films are not even closely as courageous and offbeat as they think they are. Just as the title is not nearly as clever as it thinks it is. I mean, come on. Really?Incidentally the fact that it does carry a double meaning - since an actual murder is part of the story - is the first hint at why this movie cannot live up to the expectations a film about the Beat poets evokes in the first place.",Kill Your Darlings

73,plsbr0,And the Hippos Were Boiled In Their Tanks...,10,28 August 2021,"If you know the background history--what the film was based on--you will absolutely appreciate the film.Lucien Carr was the man who brought the first Beats together. William Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac all met each other through Carr. He is unknown genius who turned the generation around. Ginsberg quotes, ""Lu was the Glue."" After the murder and incarceration, they all kept in touch, though Carr lost all his aspiration for poetry and literature. He is mentioned in several books published written by many writers from the generation. There, you will find more backstories to what inspired the film.The film is written based on the true story, but it does omit many factors that played in part as well as changing some details. The film is to be taken as a film. So prior to watching the film, if you did not know much about the early Beats era, let alone Lucien Carr, you may find the film not as exciting as I have. But if you found the film interesting enough to dig more into it, I highly suggest reading some of the early literature including books that have archived diaries or letters between each other. It's a deep, deep, deep rabbit hole you'll hopefully enjoy if you've not read a lot of Beats literature.I would also like to add Dane DeHaan's amazing performance here. He stars in one of my other favourite films, The Place Beyond The Pines. The cinematic performance by Dane DeHaan is outstanding. If you haven't watched the film, I recommend it. It may not be for everyone, but directed by Derek Cianfrance (director of Blue Valentine) and starring Ryan Gosling, Bradley Cooper, you name it (look up the IMDb page for yourself, it's impressive)--I can't overstate how the film is not as well known as it could be.I rewatch the film over and over (though I do admit I do it with most TV shows and films I love) every once in a while. The story behind it and what follows in history inspire me for many aspects of my life.",Kill Your Darlings
74,jhinrichs2002,Absolutely amazing.,10,19 July 2013,"I had the opportunity to see this movie at the Sundance film festival this year. Absolutely amazing. John Krokidas is a visionary. This is proof that there is an acting life for Daniel Radcliffe after Harry Potter. It is a thrilling and provocative must see. The film flows beautifully and keeps you entranced. This film pushes the limits to new depths that the industry is in desperate need of. I left the film feeling like my mind had been opened to a whole new level. I will watch this movie again and again. But keep in mind it is not for the faint of heart, it is very intense. If you want passion, betrayal, sex, drugs and as rock and roll as the 40's can get, this is your movie.",Kill Your Darlings
75,spoonfailure7,Almost never have I felt that way after a movie..,9,31 January 2014,"It was one of those evenings that you didn't plan, didn't know where you'll go, what'll happen. I'll go out on a limb here and say some ""unknown force"" guided my way so I'd be able to watch this. It did feel that way. This movie was on my watch-list the moment I saw the cast and the synopsis. And there I was, accidentally on the last screening of this film in my city, never knowing I'd actually be so careless and nearly miss my chance to see it. And the movie.. I'm currently studying Cinema production and even though I'm not really big on words nor very capable of being descriptive and knowledgeable about the topic, I sure can.. feel. And that's exactly what got me into studying film art. And films exactly like this one are the reason I care at all. Because I really, actually, generally don't. But when it moves you the way this movie does.. At the beginning I was my typical cynical self, annoyed by the so obvious hipster attitude and pretentious self-centeredness. And by the end I could not, for the life of me, collect myself. I just bailed, almost ran away and left my friends all confused. But I couldn't talk with anyone, I could not think straight. The whole movie got so tense, so hard to watch. And the soundtrack was supreme, something that is so very important about a film, but many forget. Here, it was done right. Deep and painful, so that when you manage to find that M83 track, that has been stuck in your head since the moment you heard it, you just die allover again. You literally see the scenes flash before your eyes. All in all, I still don't know why this film reached so far inside me, but it did. I refrain from recommending it, I believe it's not everyone's cup of tea, but I was really moved by it. And I had to write this, I've been dying to see it again and I'm waiting for the DVD release and it's the longest wait of my life and I'm really not usually like that. I guess it hit really close to home.",Kill Your Darlings
76,jacinta-muscat1,The Beats Live On,9,16 December 2013,"My review of Kill Your Darlings may be heavily bias because I have read everything I can get my hands on about the relationship between Ginsberg and Carr and I am a beat fan before almost many things. However, this film examines Ginsberg (Daniel Radcliffe) before he began his literary revolution and the character is one I found easy to fall in love with. Radcliffe portrays Ginsberg - with the aid of new comer writer and director John Korkidas - with a playful naive innocence as he approaches love and friendship at Columbia and his relationship between Carr (Dane DeHaan) is believable from the moment you see them in the same scene. There is an obvious chemistry between DeHaan and Radcliffe that really aids the performance. I have seen this film twice now and upon reflection I enjoyed how the sexuality of the characters was not places heavily on screen despite the homosexuality of Ginsberg being a very key aspect of the films script. The sexual tension between Ginsberg and Carr was handled very well and I was never not intrigued by the compelling dynamic between the two and, if anything, by the end of the film was more curious about the relationship than I was when I walked into the theater. Jack Huston and Ben Foster give amazing performances despite their lack of character development throughout the film but they never took all of the attention either which I especially enjoyed as it was never a film about just Ginsberg or a film about Kerouac alone as it was about all of the beat writers and the event that begun their revolution as inspirational writers. Micheal C Hall gives an incredible performance, however, I felt as though I could really see his character of Dexter in the T.V show of the same title shine through his portrayal of Kammerer. This similarity did not hinder the film as a whole but in one particular scene I felt as though I was watching Dexter not Kammerer. The main theme of the movie revolves around 'A Vision' by William Butler Yeats and his idea of life being circular carries deep within viewers as they watch Ginsberg's life 'widen'. This film is a must see for any of you who love the beats or those of you who are inspired by indie films about deeply buried tales.",Kill Your Darlings
77,horrymain14,Manages to be both pretentious and uninteresting,3,5 September 2014,"Another reviewer described this film as sophomoric, and I would have to concur. Like the recent screen adaptation of Kerouac's On The Road, this movie makes excessive behaviors of youth look as dreary, sad, and unappealing as in retrospect they are. There's very little nuance here. Figures of the 'Establishment' are presented as little more than caricatures, and most of the artsy folk in opposition to them too full of self importance and excess to evoke sympathy. The only truly enjoyable aspect of this film, for me anyway, is Dane DeHaan's performance (warranting the three stars I gave up). This young actor has a sort of incandescent magnetism that commands your attention and eclipses everything and everyone else on the screen. Ben Foster is always interesting to watch as well, but Daniel Radcliffe--reasonably competent as a boy wizard--suffers in comparison to these greater talents in the central role of Ginsburg.",Kill Your Darlings
78,makie-91319,I loved it. Was beautifully done.,9,13 August 2015,"I watched this movie a little while ago purely because Daniel Radcliffe is in it and I was pleasantly surprised to learn that it was actually a fantastic movie. Daniel portrays Allen so well and I think they couldn't have cast a better actor for the role. The character Lucien was also amazing. Dane did wonderfully in this movie. I loved him in Lawless but I definitely like him more here. This movie instantly became one of my favourite movies and I plan to watch it multiple times. Truly amazing film. I highly recommend it. If you like any movie about poets, you will like it. If you like modern movies set in older decades, you will like it. I wish everyone would go out and buy this movie. I don't think it got enough credit for how wonderful it truly is. If you have not seen this yet, please do yourself a favor and watch it.",Kill Your Darlings

80,jelenaa-49739,Splendid!,10,9 September 2019,"As someone who has only seen Daniel Radcliffe in the most famous Harry Potter, it was refreshing to see he has many other sides and diversity in his act besides the one he has shown as a child. An astonishing story of two well-known poets and their movement to break all boundaries shown from a different point of view which makes you want to do the same. The movie itself is made and should be watched only through the emotional point of view, as you leave your reason and reality behind, which makes it only more beautiful. I watched it again after four years since I've watched it first and it still leaves the same feeling... That's the greatest thing about cinematography I suppose... It makes you feel things more than once
when its done properly. This movie is my sincere recommendation but only if you leave reality behind and watch this movie as a poet.",Kill Your Darlings
