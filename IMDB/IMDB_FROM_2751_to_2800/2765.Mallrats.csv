0,SnoopyStyle,silly follow up to great debut from Kevin Smith,4,25 August 2015,"College student T.S. Quint (Jeremy London) plans to go on a Florida trip with Brandi Svenning (Claire Forlani) but she has to fill in on her father's TV show. They argue and break up. His insensitive friend Brodie Bruce (Jason Lee) gets dumped by his girlfriend Rene Mosier (Shannen Doherty). They go to the local mall and discover that the show is being filmed there. Brodie recruits Jay and Silent Bob to disrupt the show.When compared to his first film, this Kevin Smith movie is sillier and poorer. Some of it plays like Home Alone. He's never been a visual master and this is very much in that vein. The movie is filled with Smith's love of comics and other childish gags. It's got some memorable characters like Tricia Jones, the teen Masters and Johnson. Jay and Silent Bob have become cartoon characters. Lee and Doherty are trying but London is a dud. If Smith wants wacky comedy, London is the blackhole in the middle sucking the fun out of everything.",Mallrats
1,classicsoncall,"""Oh ye of little faith, want a cookie?""",6,28 July 2018,"As raunchy and decadent that ""Clerks"" was coming out the prior year, at least I thought it was pretty funny. Coming from the same creative mind and direction of Kevin Smith, I expected ""Mallrats"" to be on a par but it failed to deliver. There were some humorous moments of course, and unless I'm mistaken, some of the language might have been toned down from the earlier flick, but there didn't seem to be enough to redeem this picture as one to recommend as a follow up to ""Clerks"". My understanding is that chronologically, this picture occurs the day before the events in ""Clerks"", but that's neither here nor there and of no consequence to my mind. The picture's most salient moment is when Stan Lee has his heart to heart chat with Brodie (Jason Lee), but after that it's pretty much down hill. The game show segment in particular was just terrible, it looked like it belonged in an entirely different picture. Still, it was cool to see Jay and Silent Bob once again, and Jason Lee has the right looks and temperament for the kind of character he portrayed. But if faced with a decision to make, you probably should just watch ""Clerks"" again.",Mallrats
2,gavin6942,My Ultimate in Pubescent Guilty Pleasures,7,8 November 2008,"After being dumped by their girlfriends, T.S. Quint(Jeremy London) and Brodie Bruce (Jason Lee) go to the mall to keep their minds off the situation. Soon, however, thoughts turn to getting their ladies back and the dynamic duo will have to fight mall security, a fashionable male (Ben Affleck) and a game show producer (Michael Rooker) in order to succeed.Writing a fair review of ""Mallrats"" is one of the hardest things for me to do, and it is no surprise that I have not done so in all the years I have been writing reviews. The film came out when I was fourteen, and I went to see it with my cousin at the local mall after a rousing bus trip. We had seen the ambiguous advertisements in the back of comic books for months and just knew this was something we had to see. Once in the theater, we were practically alone -- there were only three other people, including a younger woman and her grandmother, both of whom walked out early on.For whatever reason, I identified with this film. I had not yet seen ""Clerks"" and I did not have the background in film to really understand all the references to ""Jaws"" or ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" or ""Apocalypse Now"". But the potty humor mixed with the intelligent dialogue (even about scatological topics) hit home with me, and even now -- seventeen years later -- it remains my favorite film, despite my knowing full well it is not critically wonderful and often sexually crude.I have given the film a high rating because I simply cannot get enough of it. I have the trading cards that were sold at the time, I have visited the Eden Prairie Center where the movie was filmed (it is in Minnesota, not New jersey, strangely enough). But, I want to stress this: my high rating does not by any means indicate this is a critically beautiful film. Read the reviews of the professionals at the time (Ebert, Maltin, and others) and you will see that it was more or less expected to bomb (although I think in hindsight many more people found the film to their liking).Are there flaws? You bet. Watch Jeremy London, for example. A horrible, horrible actor. Even with these odd, scripted conversations he comes off as forced, and if you watch him while another actor is speaking, you can see him physically preparing himself to speak his lines. He cannot become the character of T.S. Quint, he can only be Jeremy London. Shannon Doherty, likewise, just does not seem to hack it... she is a better actress than many, but this film just did not work for her. She comes off as a reject from ""Empire Records"", and some lines she delivers make it seem she is not familiar with the subject matter.Despite the flaws, I am still praising this film. Watch ""Clerks"" first (even though this one takes place first in chronological order). If you like ""Clerks"", try this one. Then try ""Chasing Amy"". All three are great. Personally, I think Kevin Smith's films went downhill after that (although ""Red State"" is redeeming). He may disagree and I know many of the fans do. But if you do not mind intelligent potty humor, ""Mallrats"" is for you.",Mallrats
3,Quinoa1984,Cool Comedy,8,7 March 2000,"Kevin Smith's Mallrats is quite an amusing picture.  Some might go as far to say as it is not as high to standards as his last pictures (and sadly I slightly agree), but that still doesn't matter with Smith at the helm.  In fact, he can be better at writer/director/Silent Bob than any other one in America when he tries hard enough.  The film circles on 2 slackers at a mall where they hang out (Jay and Silent Bob also preside with Jedi powers) who want to get their girlfriends back after they dumped them.  Their escapades in one day is similar to Clerks without the black and white, but by no means is it better than Clerks.  I wish it was, but it doesn't grab you as much as Clerks did.  Still, Mallrats is a cool, hilarious comedy that is great for parties, or sick days.",Mallrats
4,wes-connors,Mr. Smith Goes to the Mall,2,16 August 2013,"It's Easter in an apparently upscale American community. After they are dumped by their girlfriends, best friends Jason Lee (as Brodie Bruce) and Jeremy London (as T.S. Quint) decide to go to the local mall. They want to hang out and have a cookie. Naturally, their ex-girlfriends are there. Shannen Doherty (as Rene Mosier) is with her new lover, ""fashionable male"" Ben Affleck (as Shannon Hamilton). Joey Lauren Adams (as Gwen Turner) is going to appear on a ""Dating Game""-type TV show as a favor to her father...By adopting a slacker look, Mr. Lee is somewhat convincing. However, the cast appears around ten years too old for the situation. Possibly directed to appear fidgety, Mr. London looks uncomfortable. Then considered the biggest star in the cast, top-billed Ms. Doherty essays her usual high-school impersonation. ""Mallrats"" like Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith (as Jay and Silent Bob) appear. Mr. Smith is also the writer and director. Introduced in front of a store selling gerbils, Smith shows some quirky, anal humor.** Mallrats (10/25/95) Kevin Smith ~ Jason Lee, Jeremy London, Shannen Doherty, Ben Affleck",Mallrats
5,BandSAboutMovies,Aged well,7,13 October 2020,"Let's be straight: I could type out the entire script of this movie by memory. That's how imporant this movie was to a 23 year old me. I even worked in an ad agency inside a mall and often felt like the characters in this, walking the shops and stores of Station Square with no shopping agenda.I was probably one of the few people back then who loved it, because it bombed and writer and director Kevin Smith apologized for the movie at the Independent Spirit Awards.Today, as Smith says on the intro to the twenty-fifth anniversary Arrow blu ray, this movie has aged into being seen as a success.The adventures of T.S. Quint (Jeremy London) and Brodie Bruce (Jason Lee) as they navigate the Eden Prairie Center Mall - actually in Minnesota*, but supposedly New Jersey - as their attempt to get over the loss of their respective girlfriends, Brandi Svenning (Claire Forlani) and Rene Mosier (Shannen Doherty). Along the way, they interact with Jay and Silent Bob, meet Stan Lee and even go to the dirt mall.That's an oversimplification of a movie that once - and yes, still - meant so much to me. What comic book geek doesn't see themselves as Brodie, a man who can somehow win over Doherty despite only caring about Superman being able to shoot semen like a shotgun and playing as Hartford on his Genesis? Even all these years later, I see him as one of the coolest characters in the movies of my youth and have followed Jason Lee through so many characters as a result.While Jay and Silent Bob Reboot felt like a massive misfire, I'm happy to see that this movie has lost none of its fun and good feelings. Sometimes, as Smith says, things just age well.The Arrow re-release of this movie comes with so much, starting with a brand new restoration by Arrow Films of both the Theatrical and Extended cuts of the film, as well as a TV cut of the film featuring overdubbing to cover up the sheer amount of profanity. There's also audio commentary with director Kevin Smith, producer Scott Mosier, archivist Vincent Pereira and actors Jason Lee, Ben Affleck and Jason Mewes, as well a new interview and introduction by Smith, a making-of film deleted scenes and more. You can get it from Arrow and totally should - they sent us a copy but I would have bought it myself.*Fargo was being filmed in the same town at the same time.",Mallrats

7,Hey_Sweden,Often very funny.,8,15 November 2012,"After a successful debut with ""Clerks"", writer / director Kevin Smith made the leap to Hollywood with this amiable sophomore effort. It doesn't have a whole lot of plot, and is rather predictable in the end, but does deliver quite a bit of laughs. It wouldn't resonate as strongly for the viewer who isn't into the same sort of things as Smith, but in any event it works well enough, benefiting from some great lines and enthusiastic performances by all. Jeremy London and Jason Lee star as good friends T.S. and Brodie, dumped by their respective girlfriends Brandi (Claire Forlani) and Rene (Shannen Doherty) and who subsequently spend an eventful day at the mall. Brandi's father Mr. Svenning (Michael Rooker) shoots the matchmaking game show which he produces there, Willam (Ethan Suplee) tries to vain to spot the sailboat in a picture which everybody else can see but him, characters Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith himself) embark on a variety of schemes to sabotage the show and sneak past security guard LaFours (Sven-Ole Thorsen), Brodie mixes it up with smarmy cretin Shannon (Ben Affleck), who's now keeping company with Rene, and Brodie chances to meet comic book legend Stan Lee, who makes an ingratiating cameo. Granted, sometimes this gets pretty silly and infantile (the ""stink hand"" sequence comes to mind) and it's also undeniably crude, but Smith still creates some fun moments and keeps the action moving right along. The gals on hand (also including Joey Lauren Adams as Gwen and Renee Humphrey as Tricia) are particularly a joy to watch; Priscilla Barnes of 'Three's Company' fame has a priceless bit as a fortune teller who plies her trade while topless (and whose impressive bosom can boast an unusual characteristic). Lee has a field day playing the irrepressible Brodie, a man who's never at a loss for words. All set to a hip soundtrack, ""Mallrats"" is solidly entertaining stuff with a nice wrap-up updating us on the fates of the characters. Eight out of 10.",Mallrats
8,lastliberal,"You should see yourself right now, a grown man with his hand down his pants.",5,23 August 2007,"As slacker movies go, this was disappointing. It just doesn't seem funny to me seeing losers like Jeremy London and Jason Lee whining because they lost their girlfriends. I just can't imagine Claire Forlani with either of these two slackers anyway.Living a life of video games and comic books does not prepare you to be a winner, and the formula that Kevin Smith (writer and director) has developed was cute in Clerks, but is old now. Throw in Jay and Silent Bob, the Force, potty humor, and vicious threats from Ben Affleck, and you reach a new low. Well, maybe Jersey Girl was lower.This one just doesn't do it.",Mallrats
9,Sylviastel,Same Smith Formula but new location!,7,27 April 2008,"Kevin Smith wrote and directed this crowd pleaser about two dumped young guys who spend the day at the local mall. As usual, Smith has his regular cast mates like Ben Affleck, Joey Lauren Adams, Silent Bob and Jay. In this film, we see Earl's Jason Lee and his on screen brother Randy played by Ethan Suplee who has a role in the film as Willam trying to see the sailboat in a picture. The film takes place in early Spring because of the Easter holiday where there is an Easter bunny taking pictures with children. There is Shannen Doherty playing Renee, the ex-girlfriend of Jason Lee's character, Brodie. The film has some nice moments about a television show being taped at the mall. It's a shame that they cut Elizabeth Ashley, a brilliant actress. The film also pays homage to Smith's love of comic books with Stan Lee as himself. It's an okay, entertaining film but not brilliant and not one of my favorites.",Mallrats
10,Mr-Fusion,A cesspool of slackers,7,10 June 2019,"Easily one of the lightest and hijink-filled Kevin Smith movies, ""Mallrats"" is the unlikely love story buried in a tale of consumerist tomfoolery. There are all sorts of little things happening in this movie that make me laugh, but you've gotta hand it to Jason Lee for really shouldering this thing. The man's working in shades of irate and I don't think he fails to pull off a single line. This is proof he was born to play Banky Edwards in Chasing Amy, and his rage never fails to delight. Doesn't matter what kind of day I'm having, simply hearing him yell ""That kid is on the escalator again!"" is always a mood-brightener.",Mallrats
11,lasttimeisaw,A Chinese opinion,7,11 March 2007,"Kevin Smith is a kind of strange species in Hollywood, I've seen his two films before, JERSEY GIRL and DOGMA. But not the most famous one THE CLERK, that's why I haven't seen CLERK 2 up to the present, and I think I'll watch them together one day.As for this movie, still quite Kevin Smith, we can find the famous Jay and Silent Bob here, also the regular cast including Jason Lee, Ben Affleck, Joey Lauren Adams etc. The plot line is kinda funny, most of the scenes happened in a local mall, two guys are going to win their girlfriends back, not like teen movie s these days, this one contains numerous japes which are neither dirty nor tacky, the measure between between humor and smarty is hard to handle, this film manages it very well. Although in my opinion, Michael Rooker gives a rather gross performance (it's horrible to see his fat ass on screen!).As a Chinese, Kevin Smith seems too local for me, so I don't think I'm his loyal fan, but he's intelligent and has some good quality to make more WIDER films, and I do like silent bob, he's the funniest part in this film.",Mallrats
12,lost-in-limbo,To learn that of life's lessons just take a trip to the mall.,7,5 March 2006,"After being dumped by their girlfriends, T.S and Brodie decide to head to the mall for the day to forget their worries. But after all the mayhem they manage to get up to in the mall, they just can't get their ex-girlfriends off their mind. So the two team up with the help of Jay and Silent Bob to come up with a plan to win them back. Though, they got the likes of T.S' girlfriend's dad and that of a scummy store manager to overcome before winning back their girls.Don't you just love the self-loathing, slacker generation! After the huge and promising success that was ""Clerks"" for director/writer Kevin Smith. Obiviously there was pressure to repeat that winning formula with his follow up. Even though ""Mallrats"" is a more bigger and polished studio bound production of ""Clerks"" set in the mall, it just didn't take off at all. It came and went by with little interest. Maybe it doesn't hold that fundamentally cunning humour and smarting realism that made the low budget film ""Clerks"" originally quirky and fresh. I'm not a big fan of Smith's work, as I've only caught his first three flicks and I still think his third film ""Chasing Amy"" is the best. But this commercially mainstream project isn't all a failure, because the film still does come up with an entertaining tale of laid-back characters with a muster of jokes set-up in a mall. Definitely much more crass and juvenile are the gags this time and somewhat the humour tries to be funny than naturally being it. But what compensates it is that there was a continuous roll with one after another, so if one didn't work out there's another that would hopefully evoke a laugh. The film is actually made up of little episodes that happen throughout the day with something endlessly popping up and many characters deciding to make a scene. It's all over the place you can say. There are some memorably comical sequences like that of the Stan Lee cameo, the Easter bunny and that of the cheesy date game show. But there's one lewd segment involving chocolate pretzels, which will make you barf.What makes this quite fun is that of the lively performances of Jason Lee's self-absorbed Brodie and the always reliable pairing of Jay and Silent Bob. Also adding to the enjoyable mess are Shannon Doherty, Claire Forlani, Jeremy London, Joey Lauren Adams, Priscilla Barnes, Michael Rooker and a slimy performance by Ben Affleck. The spontaneous dialog is self-conscious with its referential gags and it's filled with a carefree attitude and pure nonsense amongst the stemming wisdom and frankness. Especially those facts considering that of the mall's customs and the respect it deserves. Heck! I should know, as I had a friend that persistently visited the mall everyday just to be there for the sake of it. Though, I thought it turned into moralistic babble in the dying stages. But these things don't take away from sarcastic interplay and skits that are generated throughout the running time, even though it really seems like an eccentric melodrama with humorous overtones at times. A nice bubblegum rock soundtrack crops up to mould itself within the context and the camera-work has a professional touch too. The best way to take it is to see it as good undemanding fun!Smith tried outdoing himself here, but sometimes it doesn't work and it seems more conventional than his other films, but that doesn't stop this from being alluringly amusing and satisfying when you comes to the ending credits.",Mallrats
13,bowmanblue,Finally getting the credit it deserves,8,3 July 2019,"Writer/director (and dare I say 'actor?'), Kevin Smith, introduced the cinematic world to the mega low-budget film 'Clerks' in 1994. And, in short, despite its tiny budget, it was a commercial (and more importantly) critical success. Therefore, Smith was afforded a bigger budget and with it bigger stars for his next outing, the 1995 (semi follow-up) 'Mallrats.' Way before Marvel introduced us to its mainstream 'shared universe,' Smith was already setting all his films ('Clerks, Mallrats and the subsequent releases, too) in his own 'shared universe,' complete with jokes and references to characters in other films.'Mallrats' follows the exploits of two - semi - 'losers' (Brodie and TS played by Jason Lee and Jeremy London) who both happen to get dumped by their respective girlfriends on the same day. To generally drown their sorrows, they head to the local mall to generally 'hang out.' However, it's fair to say that the adventures they get into involve more than just ordering a few slushies in the food court and doing a bit of window shopping. Not only do they come up with weird and wonderful plans to win back their exes, but they also get entangled with psychotic security guards, underage girls who study older men by, er, well... you'll have to watch it and find out, plus - of course - regulars 'Jay' and 'Silent Bob' - a pair of losers/drug dealers who have a habit of drawing trouble wherever they go.What follows is everything from a zany teen comedy with plenty of screwball antics which never takes itself seriously and yet also has a fair few points of social commentary and genuine heart thrown in their for good measure. Sounds great, huh? Well, the critics of the time absolutely hated it. In fact, in one of Smith's later films, he even used snippets of various scathing critics' reviews to describe a fictional film that other characters were talking about. I guess it's fair to say that it didn't fair too well at the Box Office. Which, in my opinion, is an absolute tragedy. I loved it and always have and, I'm pleased to say, that as the years have passed, it's gradually found its true cult following and is now regarded as a 'worthy successor/follow up' to the excellent 'Clerks.'Shannon Doherty (who I'm reliably informed was very famous at the time, even though I hadn't seen anything with her in!) surprisingly takes lead billing, even though she's not in it that much. Plus you have Kevin Smith's real life mate - a very young Ben Affleck - in there, also as a bit of an extended cameo.Overall, it's just a great film. Yes, most of the jokes are a bit, er, 'adult' in nature, so it's probably more akin to a sort of 'American Pie' type film (albeit with more heart and social commentary) than a family film. Plus it's aged well. The gags don't rely on (many) 'pop culture' references for laughs, therefore they still stand up well to this day. I can see the latter teens of today appreciating the silliness on display here just as much as I did when I first watched it. And, I'm glad to say that now I'm in my forties, I still get as many laughs watching it now as I did back in the nineties when it was first released.However, I am still yet to see a 'sailboat' in one of those 'magic eye' pictures. You'll have to watch the film to get that reference. I hate those 'magic eye' pictures. I really do.",Mallrats
14,ThomasDrufke,Just Two Nerds at a Mall,8,28 June 2017,"There's something so singular and relatable about Kevin Smith's movies. Even when they feature ridiculous plots and unrealistic characters, I always find something about them grounded. That likely has to do with the fact that I share many of the same interests as Smith, with the biggest being, comic-books.Mallrats is about a group of college students who lounge around their local mall because they have nothing better to do. More specifically, Mallrats deals with two guys who have recently been broken up with, and devise a brilliant (or not so brilliant) plan to win them back. The chaos that ensues at the mall falls nothing short of being good ole screwball fun.That's part of the reason why Kevin Smith succeeds with Mallrats so well, he's not making this for critics, he makes his movies for his friends and the fans. Not that critics wouldn't enjoy such irreverent fun, but the lack of sophistication in the way the characters act in Mallrats isn't something you see in most Hollywood films. Visiting a topless fortune teller, beating up the mall Easter Bunny, elevator sex, or listening to Stan Lee fake monologue about his past are only a few of the things that go on. You either like Smith's style or you don't, I just happen to be one of those people who do.Mallrats only works if the writing and the characters are as memorable as they are. Watching a comedy 20 years after its release provides ample time for reevaluation if the bits are still funny, and if they are you know that it's a good piece of cinema. Although the stuff inside the mall may be dated, the jokes certainly are not. At least for me, that is. In all, Smith created another beloved gem with Mallrats, albeit with a slightly goofy sense of humor.8.1/10",Mallrats
15,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,7,6 July 2015,"Mallrats If it weren't for shopping malls teenagers would be forced to spend their weekends playing organized sports.Even the twenty-something year olds would be distraught without the mall, as this comedy illustrates.To console his friend T.S.

16,Bored_Dragon,Kevin Smith is awesome,9,8 May 2017,"""Mallrats"" is the second in line of ingenious achievements of Kevin Smith. Although with an almost identical cast, it is completely different than ""Clerks"" and it's hard to decide which one is better. But this one is definitely funnier. I like this movie so much that even Shannen Doherty, whom I cannot stand, becomes lovable in it. It is smart, witty, entertaining, with a bunch of great actors and unforgettable quotes. Jay and Silent Bob, from supporting role, come closer to the first team and you simply have to love them. After this, you cannot wait to see them again in the next movie. I want to rate it 10/10, but I have to at least try to maintain a certain level of objectivity, because this definitely isn't one of the best movies in the history of cinematography. But it is one of the dearests for sure.8,5/10",Mallrats
17,The-Sarkologist,Pretty Cool but more mainstream than Clerks,9,15 September 2013,"After seeing this movie all I can really say is that Kevin Smith has a really weird sense of humour. The humour of Clerks is still here in Mallrats, but the language has been toned down a bit so that the movie receives only an MA rating instead of the R rating that Clerks received.Mallrats is similar to Clerks in that it deals with relationships. There are numerous similarities, namely that the good things are the ones that we tend to let go of. Jay and Silent Bob are here and play a much more active role, and the weird philosophical discussions, such as how Lois Lane cannot have Superman's babies because Kryptonite babies would probably kill her, are also here. One major difference though is that Mallrats is a much more expensive film and it shows. Mallrats is in colour, is set in a Mall, and has a lot of extras. Kevin Smith winds the entire movie up with a big dating game, and even has a comic book writer make a cameo appearance (which is not surprising considering this guy was probably Smith's hero).Mallrats seems to be like the Bill and Ted's movies in that way that it ends with a big extravaganza in front of a huge audience. There are antagonists in this movie as well. Le Four the security guard, and the father of an ex-girlfriend who is hosting a dating game in which he is giving away his daughter because the previous contestant died of an embolism while trying to loose weight for the show. It is also interesting that the characters are also similar. We have one loud mouthed guy who seems to have a response for everything, and a humbler guy who is more or less led around by the louder guy. This time though they are both trying to win back their girlfriends while trying to defeat the forces stopping them.Mallrats deals mainly with relationships and why they break up. It is also interesting how the comic book writer says that his worst mistake was giving up his girlfriend for the comic books. It makes us think what is important in our lives, our relationships or our material goods. This guy says that the worst mistake he made was to place material goods over relationships. Even though he had heaps of women in the future, it wasn't worth giving up a genuine relationship for. This is what makes me think because there is only one thing worth giving up a relationship for and that is God. Everybody says that women are not worth it but a true, loving relationship should be far more important than any job, or material goods. A relationship with God is worth more than anything because God wants one with us, and who is it to say no to the most powerful being in the universe. The more I think about material wealth, the more I come to see how pointless it all is.I still wonder if Kevin Smith is a Christian or not because even though he thanks God for making the movie possible, the stuff that we find in the movie is really something that would dishonour God immensely. Things like showing naked breasts and rampant sex in an elevator. Even sex with a fifteen year old girl, though that guy that does it is arrested for it. Personally I think Smith might be quite liberal in his faith, but when it comes down to it, only God knows where we are at.",Mallrats
18,UniqueParticle,Magnificent fun,9,10 August 2020,A great oddball blast one of Kevin Smiths best! So happy to own on Blu-Ray as of recently.

19,Floated2,Hasn't Aged Well,3,15 August 2014,"Mallrats is the second major film directed and written by Kevin Smith. Mallrats at the time was criticized as one of his worst films. The result is generally the same (gross-out gags, silly jokes, intelligent- speaking college-age teens who talk about nothing but modern culture (as in ""entertainment""), a constant stream of profanity and vulgarity)Mallrats has a very think yet simple plot. Has Brodie (Jason Lee), and his friend T.S. (Jeremy London) being broken up by their respective girlfriends, Brandi (Claire Forlani) and Rene (Shannen Doherty). So they decide to hang out at the mall. They eventually end up meeting characters Jay and Silent Bob, as well as their ex-girlfriends. The film is predictable as in it is ultimately tat they will win back their girlfriends, but the quest is how they do it, and their obstacles along the way. In which, they end up on a game show. The finale is somewhat dis interesting, although it provides for entertainment.Mallrats provides some entertainment, but in general of rewatching the film, I have found many of the jokes and gags to be cheesy, outdated, and general not funny.
===
As a rewatch 07/05/18' Mallrats remain quite a forgettable and unfunny comedy. There are some pieces of entertainment but as a whole, the film feels very off, awkward and outdated. The lead characters are both quite unlikable and selfish and the comedy just in't funny in the slightest.",Mallrats
20,johnnyboyz,A wannabe cult film that falls well short of Kevin Smith's supposed 'genius' nametag.,6,19 November 2006,"'Mallrats' is the second film from writer/director Kevin Smith; and despite his accolades and masses of fans; is nothing to get too excited about.Although the film carries a nice, realistic feeling through most of it as well as maintaining a nice atmosphere for most of the duration, the film is overall of poor quality. I'll admit that the humour put through via dialogue is smooth and close to seamless as well as the fact it contains entertaining one liners and interesting repetitions of a certain jokes; something we saw in 'Clerks.' (1994) that was used to good effect, albeit a little too often.Although the basics seem to be present and are exploited well, the real bulk of Mallrats: its plot, characters and acting all fail to live up to the hype. The film begins to play out like a love triangle comedy and although the script is trying to paper over the cracks, it doesn't take a genius to see that, really, it's just a load of slapstick humour in a mall with a love theme (I say 'theme' because there is not enough evidence to suggest this is a romance story). The fact that a shopping mall is used as the setting for the duration of the film is a little silly and as a 'world' for the characters, it soon grates. The settings become repetitive, the scenes predictable and the whole thing just gets frustrating.Before I saw the film, it was built up as one thing, but what the finish product was, was something completely different. It was a cheap, wannabe cult film that ended up like a rom-com with a load of slapstick. I mean, how many times can you re-watch a film where someone trips, flies through the air and crashes into a female changing room booth door and is supposed to act as the humour? The plot for the film is supposed to read something like the following: 'Two guys are dumped by their girlfriends and hang around a mall all day'. Fine, but where's the rest of it? There are numerous, ludicrous events that happen during the film such as the silly recording of a date game show (yawn) and the daft tactics that the characters Jay and Silent Bob use to defeat security guards (Batman gadgets to winch away to safety?!). Things like this can only be put up with for so long before they become tiresome and unbelievable. The film was built up as something much more simple than this so why didn't it play out in a much simpler manner? Perhaps more similar to Clerks.Although some of the acting by Jay and Silent Bob is rather funny and the script is witty in general, especially the opening monologue which was a great way to announce the film, Mallrats is let down by its inability to keep a good, consistent, realistic joke going in the long run. The antics and slapstick become dull and by the time the laughably bad climax has arrived, you really have switched off; pretty much entirely. Fans of this will like it for a while but will grow out of it in time but by that time, a whole new generation will have come along and started to like it, so I guess at least that's a good thing.",Mallrats

If you can put yourself into the mindset of a 20-something slacker, who has no ambition whatsoever in life, this film may engender some sense of emotional investment in its characters and a sense of identifying with same. However, if this situation is impossible for you, then you will not only not see the humor herein, you will most likely bemoan the time wasted in its viewing.This is a Jay and Silent Bob flick wherein the two buds are dumped by their gals, subsequently seeking major wound-licking in the mall. It plays like the Revenge of the Nerds, though not as intelligently, nor with the same amount of heart, but with a more modern spin.If you've of a mind, this can be highly entertaining.

23,MaxBorg89,"Not as sharp as Clerks, but worth watching for Jason Lee's foolproof performance",7,8 March 2007,"After the unexpected huge success of his debut feature Clerks, Kevin Smith was allowed to do whatever he wanted. This ""whatever"" became Mallrats, which is basically a more expensive version of Clerks, with an added plot.From the beginning, it is clear the bigger budget hasn't tamed Smith's crude humor: the movie opens with Brodie Bruce (Jason Lee) talking about a sexually deranged cousin of his named Walt (who could be the same ""cousin Walt"" Randal kept mentioning in Clerks). Following this filthy introduction, we meet the main characters: two slackers who are in trouble with their girlfriends. One is T.S. Quint (Jeremy London), who involuntarily caused the death of Julie Dwyer (another Clerks reference). Because of this, someone has to take Julie's place on the game show ""Truth or Date"", and that someone happens to be his sweetheart, Brandi Svenning (Claire Forlani), whose father (Michael Rooker) created the show and also really hates T.S. Then we have the aforementioned Brodie, who gets dumped by Rene (Shannen Doherty) because he's too obsessed with comic-books and video games. In order to get over the situation, the two pals decide to hang out at the mall, only to find out that the new episode of ""Truth or Date"" is being taped there. In addition, an arrogant salesman (Ben Affleck) is desperately trying to end up in bed with Rene. Heck, if it weren't for Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith), it would be a pretty lousy day.The main charm of Clerks was that its lack of plot was compensated by charismatic characters and wisecracking dialogue. This time around, there is a plot, but it's incredibly boring, mainly because most of the characters aren't that interesting. While Rooker's pantomime villain is quite enjoyable in the few scenes where he appears, the female leads are completely lifeless and devoid of anything meaningful to say, and so is London's Dante Hicks clone (not to mention Affleck, who doesn't do much else than shout and look like he's asking to be punched). Luckily, Jay and Silent Bob are as outrageously fun as ever (the latter's attempts to ""use the Force"" are exhilarating), and Lee's Randal variation is foul-mouthed and likable enough to carry the picture. Whether he's discussing Superman's reproductive habits, describing how to ""stinkpalm"" someone (arguably the film's best use of Smith's trademark un-PC writing) or chatting with idol Stan Lee (a really smart cameo, I must say), the My Name is Earl star is what moves Mallrats from ""dire rehash of Clerks"" to ""flawed but watchable rehash of Clerks"".Overall, worth a look if you're a fan of Kevin Smith. It may be the lesser of his works, but still funnier than most other comedies out there.6,5/10",Mallrats
24,kirbylee70-599-526179,ANOTHER DAY AT THE MALL,9,21 December 2020,"In 1994 director/writer Kevin Smith stunned the movie world with a small film he made called CLERKS. A critical success and Sundance hot property it was picked up and became a hit of the independent circle. So it seemed natural that a studio would want to pick up this hot new director and make a big movie with him in charge. That film was MALLRATS and when released it flopped big time. Much of that had to do with studio involvement and less from Smith himself. But here's the thing.While the movie wasn't well received at the box office it became a huge cult film. Fans flocked to the movie when it was released on tape and disc. The film featured two characters from CLERKS, Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith) who went on to star in more Smith films including two of their own. The film also pre-dated the interest of comic book fans that was to come by featuring Marvel creator Stan Lee in a cameo before many movie goers knew who he was. Not bad for a second directorial film.In case you haven't seen it the movie does take place for the most part at the mall. This is where the teens and recently post teens tend to hang out, shop, eat, meander and meet. Think DAWN OF THE DEAD before they were real adults. T.S. Quint (Jeremy London) is a college student planning on a trip to Universal Studios in Florida where he plans on asking his girlfriend Brandi (Claire Forlani) to marry him. But at the last minute she can't make the trip because her father Svenning (Michael Rooker) needs her as a replacement on the dating game show he's pitching to producers at the mall. When T.S. gets upset the pair break up.Seeking solace from his best friend Brodie (Jason Lee) whose girlfriend Rene (Shannon Doherty) has just dumped him for not acknowledging her to his mother, the pair decide to take comfort in the mall, their home away from home. Once there they realize the Svenning's show TRUTH OR DATE is being shot there and recruit Jay and Silent Bob to take down the show.Along the way they meet up with other friends, past girlfriends, mall security and the aforementioned Stan Lee who offers Brodie some serious life advice. Brodie faces off against the tough guy jerk Rene is now thinking of dating (Ben Affleck). And T.S. tries to find a way to win back Brandi.The film is a perfect combination of characters and dialogue, something that Smith has always exceled at. Why did the film not find its audience when released? Who knows? The poster art was great for comic fans but maybe that chased away fans of his first film. Maybe the list of names in the film wasn't big enough. At this point in time the only recognizable name was Doherty who was just coming off of TV's BEVERLY HILLS 90210. Thankfully fans did finally find the film and made it the success it has become.There are plenty of hilarious moments in the film, many of them involving Jay and Bob. But they're not the only ones with memorable moments. Thanks to William (Ethan Suplee) you'll never look at one of those 3-D magic eye pictures the same way again. And you'll also never take a chocolate covered pretzel again if offered to you.Arrow Video. The name alone should tell you that this movie is going to be given it's due here. As they always do they shine with this offering. First off this is a brand new restoration by Arrow Films of both the Theatrical and Extended cuts of the film, approved by director Kevin Smith and cinematographer David Klein.

In fact, it is pretty much a rehashing of Clerks, with two protagonist lay-abouts talking about nonsense things, one without a care in the world, the other more serious. This is Mallrats plot, and Clerks plot, yet this did not seem like a rip-off. The movie's plot is two guys go to the mall after their girlfriends break up with them, and try to win them back. It's a really interesting film, and it's pretty darn funny too. It looks great, and I love the character sub-plots at the mall, Like Jay and Silent Bob trying to knock down a stage, or Willam staring at the trick picture but never seeing the sailboat. It's a stupid movie, but it's a bit of a pick me up, and a good one. I highly recommend this film, and to go with it, how about some chocolate pretzels? My rating: *** 1/4 out of ****. 93 mins.

29,triple8,Not the worst movie in the world but don't expect Clerks.,4,14 March 2005,"Mallrats, while not being anywhere near as bad as to be, say in the IMDb worst movies ever, lacks the charm of Clerks. I happen to adore Clerks, it is one of my favorite films ever and certainly up there with a rare few with being one of the all time best teen movies.Mallrats, while maybe mildly entertaining, can't touch the classic wit and brilliance that is Clerks. I actually thought Mall Rats was more obnoxious then funny and though I know this movie is very appealing to some, I just never got it.When I saw Mallrats, it was tough for me to watch to the end. The problem is the movie is meandering in a way Clerks was not, both movies capture day to day life, that's what I love about Smith, that he's able to do that. But even if there had never been a movie called Clerks, Mallrats struck me as being like a million other movies out there and while I can relate to hangin at the mall as a teen, the characters, as many have stated on this board were just majorly obnoxious. Again, in Clerks, any obnoxiousness the characters or movie had was overcome by the hilarious but always intelligent humor. With Mallrats, it's just another teen movie.(LOL.) It didn't linger in my mind afterward and dragged a lot while it was on. Just wasn't into it.Perhaps I was spoiled by the greatness of Clerks(a movie I've seen so many times I have lost count.) But even if this hadn't been Smith who brought us Mallrats-I just didn't care for this. I wish there would have been better dialog, less rambling, more charm and genuine wit and have some more twists and turns.",Mallrats
30,Spleen,An amiable movie that shows us that even mallrats are human,8,5 September 1999,"Whereas `Clerks' wasn't certain whether it was gritty realism or goofy fantasy, `Mallrats' KNOWS it's goofy fantasy.  That's exactly the right way to play it.  No-one has ever had a profound thought in a modern shopping mall.  Any film that makes claims to the contrary is lying.This is Smith's sunniest film - despite being set in the harsh, mercury-vapour-lit mallworld - with delicious humour and, for once, appealing characters.  People are correct when they say it's an 80s movie. It's an 80s movie done RIGHT.",Mallrats

32,Sandcooler,Mr.Smith goes to Hollywood,6,9 June 2009,"A comedy really can't get much lighter than this one. There isn't really any story worth talking about, there isn't even anything particularly memorable about it at all, but I enjoyed it while it lasted. Guys walk around in the mall, meet people, walk around some more. There aren't even that many real jokes, it's just the whole situation that gets a chuckle out of me. Jason Lee is rather average, and Jeremy London is just plain bad, but man check out that mean supporting cast. Michael Rooker as the angry father, Ethan Suplee as a guy staring at a picture, Stan Lee as himself, Dante Hicks himself Brian O'Halloran as ""Gil Hicks"", Jay and Silent Bob, combine all these people and your movie just can't possibly suck. At times it does feel that Kevin Smith was a bit over his head though. His script isn't bad, but it's really the kind of script that needs to be made for cheap. When you spend six million dollars on kids walking around, it just looks a bit weird at times. This is not my favourite Kevin Smith movie, but there's enough joy in it for everyone.",Mallrats

34,brando647,"Not quite a ""smart Porky's"", but still worthwhile...",7,23 April 2005,"While this one of my least favorite Kevin Smith films, it is still fun to watch. ""Mallrats"", while not on the intellectually funny level of Smith's ""Clerks"", has its share of laughs (and, yes, vulgarity). Though it isn't as high quality as its predecessor, ""Mallrats"" made two very important contributions to Smith's Jersey Crew, in the form of actors Jason Lee and Ben Affleck. Lee plays the character of Brodie Bruce, an avid comic book collector who is dumped by his tolerant girlfriend the same morning his friend, T.S. Quint (Jeremy London), is dumped by his. Lee is one of the funniest actors I've seen. He easily made Brodie one my top favorite Jersey characters. Pre-""Armageddon"" Affleck plays Shannon Hamilton, owner of the Fashionable Male clothing store. While his acting is nothing special in this film, he shines in Smith's later movies (but that is a topic for another time). This movie is like the younger, less mature, brother to ""Clerks"", relying a little more on nudity and crude jokes (I am not saying that is always necessarily a bad thing!). This movie is a must for any Smith fan.",Mallrats

My opinion of Kevin Smith has totally flip flopped since those days in that now I despise him. All of the terrible trends of his movies are here including awful dialogue (in parts), awful acting (in parts), misplaced attempts at pathos, aimlessness, over-reliance on his personal obsessions, etc. But colour me surprised to say that some of this movie still works. Jason Lee specifically. Jeremy London and Claire Forlani are awful, but you can blame the dialogue there. Despite the hackneyed plot, Jason Lee holds this together and there are a few solid laughs scattered throughout. Because he wasn't trying to go all sentimental (for the most part) this movie holds up better. Now on to Chasing Amy.",Mallrats
36,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Mallrats""- Kevin Smith's sophomore effort never quite comes together, but supplies just enough chuckles to keep you invested. A charming and mindless bit of fun.",7,9 October 2017,"Critically maligned and met with an overwhelmingly apathetic reception from audiences, Kevin Smith's sophomore effort ""Mallrats"" went down as a major studio blunder back in 1995, bombing at the box office and being largely ignored by the masses. It came and went, fizzling out before it even got going. It wasn't until years later that the film finally grew a fairly dedicated and loving fan-base thanks to its success on the rental market and through DVD sales, as more and more fans of Smith went back and gave it the fair chance it never got in theaters. While it is still considered something of an enigma in the grand scheme of Smith's ""View Askew"" movie franchise, to which this serves as the second chapter, it is nice to see that the movie has finally been accepted and found its audience. Because while it never quite comes together as a cohesive whole, ""Mallrats"" is still nonetheless a charming and frequently entertaining little film.Set one day before Smith's breakout hit ""Clerks,"" ""Mallrats"" follows the duo of T.S. Quint (Jeremy London) and his slacker best-friend Brodie Bruce (Jason Lee), as they spend the day at the local mall to get over their respective breakups with girlfriends Brandi (Claire Forlani) and Rene. (Shannen Doherty) When T.S. learns that Brandi is going to take part in a live-broadcast for a new dating game-show at the mall to appease her overbearing father (Michael Rooker), the two friends set out to sabotage it and try to win back their girls at any cost- including enlisting the wild stoner duo of Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (director Smith)... All the while, they must also dodge the dreaded security guard LaFours (Sven-Ole Thorsen), contend with the opportunistic and kinky bully Shannon (Ben Affleck), and spend time chatting with friends and fellow mall-goers including Gwen (Joey Lauren Adams) and Tricia. (Renee Humphrey)""Mallrats"" has also been a fascinating film when placed in the context of Smith's career, especially when you know more about the unique production and its initial release. The movie was produced by the late James Jacks, whom had frequently said that ""Mallrats"" was the most fun he's ever had on a movie. It was going to be Smith's big break in mainstream filmmaking, and a calling card for his abilities, mixing in the clever and sharp dialog and indie sensibilities he displayed in ""Clerks"" with a higher-budget concept and humor that aimed to be a bit more mainstream. But the film was butchered in editing for timing and pacing reasons, and the publicity was suspect at best, leading to disaster upon release.And that's a shame, because there is quite a bit to enjoy here. Smith might be aiming for a more mainstream release, but the film is still punctuated by bursts of his trademark clever writing and sharp observational humor, which gives it a good hint of that Kevin Smith flavor that his fans adore. The characters are all typically written as very likable and you have a great deal of fun following them. And Brodie Bruce is definitely a classic Smith character, spouting one-liners and sarcastic quips that audiences will eat up. The set-pieces can also be quite nice, and it's a lot of fun seeing Smith with more money and resources at his disposal. It might not be a perfect film, and the more ambitious scenes sometimes feel a tad bit forced and poorly thought out, but it's entertaining at very least and will definitely supply just enough chuckles and giggles to keep open-minded audiences invested.I was also quite taken by several of the performances. Particularly Jason Lee in one of his earliest roles. Lee lights up the screen and does a fantastic job, showing hints of the incredible work that would follow in the years after release. Affleck and Doherty are also quite a bit of fun as their respective characters, with Affleck in particular being the sort-of slimy scumbag you'll just love to hate. And I also gotta give a special shout-out to Joey Lauren Adams and Renee Humphrey. While their roles are minimal and they each only have a small handful of scenes, both steal the show whenever they're on screen and are a blast and a half. Unfortunately, London and Forlani suffer and come across as a bit too dry on screen. They lack interest or depth and feel like they were inserted to be the ""straight men"" to the more comedic characters.I also do have to say that the film doesn't quite come together as well as most of Smith's other works, and it stands out as the oddball of the ""View Askewniverse."" The movie tries to find a balance between clashing styles, and it sometimes feels contrived and inorganic. You can't go from clever and contemplative one scene to seeing a mall Easter- Bunny being comically beaten up into the next scene without some transition... It goes from stylistically from ""Clerks"" to ""Three Stooges"" and back more than once, and it never quite flows. In addition, references feel far too dated and shoehorned into the narrative, and the movie's occasional attempts at inserting ""cartoon logic"" into the mix come across as completely baffling. It's just... sloppy compared to what came before and after for Smith and his cohorts. You can also really tell when scenes have been cut or trimmed, and the movie feels incomplete. (Thankfully though, this issue was eventually fixed with the release of an extended cut.)Still, I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy the heck out of ""Mallrats."" It's kitschy, dated 90's cheese that doesn't quite work. But it's got enough laughs and enough jokes and enough likable characters for me to forgive its more obvious faults. And so, I give ""Mallrats"" a pretty decent 7 out of 10. Definitely worth seeing for fans of director Kevin Smith.",Mallrats

The boys decide ""screw it, let's go to the mall"".Brody is a frequent visitor and knows the mall back to front, it is fair to say that he is quite passionate about the mall and the value that it has for society, in fact between Brody and T.S. they seem to know almost everyone in the damn place.And so on and so forth: The characters talk like no-one actually talks, only in a Smith way not a Tarantino way, there is generally pointless human interaction between the leads and the usual Kevin Smith regulars (Affleck, Joey Lauren Adams, etc), and the entire plot revolves around the boys trying to sabotage a game show run by T.S.'s ex's Father.The ending is farcical, it seems like much more time was spent shoehorning in pop culture references and dirty jokes than the actual story, much like Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, which at least had better jokes and knew it was dumb.I would be willing to forgive this if the thing was just funnier. But the fact is that it isn't, the reason Mallrats was caned by the critics isn't because of the potty talk and innuendo (even if it was), it was because in between all that there is a distinct lack of actual jokes.I know Kevin Smith has done some good stuff in between this and the execrable Cop Out. I remain a big fan of Clerks, thought Dogma was both funny and creative and even liked Clerks 2 much more than I expected, but like the girl with the little curl ""when he is good he is very, very good, but when he is lazy he is just boring"".Final Rating – 5 / 10.

39,Beta_Gallinger,"An insane and juvenile comedy, but for some people, that's not always a bad thing",8,28 July 2007,"I was too young to see this movie when it was first released, but first saw it about a decade later. When this happened, I must confess, I found it painfully boring! However, this may have simply been because I wasn't in a very good mood. I had just arrived at the house of some fairly long distance relatives and may have been tired after the long car ride. Thinking that could have easily been the case, I watched it again after a while, expecting to like it a lot more than I did previously, and I was right! Two teenagers, T.S. Quint and his best friend, the comic book-loving Brodie Bruce, are both dumped by their girlfriends on the same day. Obviously not happy about this, they decide to go to the mall and hang out. While inside, they encounter several people, including the mischievous Jay and Silent Bob, and Jared Svenning, the father of Brandi (T.S.' now ex-girlfriend), who is having a stage set up in the mall for his game show, ""Truth or Date"". As T.S. and Brodie walk around the mall, they have plans to try and win their girlfriends back, though they will have to face the nasty Shannon Hamilton. Meanwhile, Jay and Silent Bob help by attempting to sabotage the ""Truth or Date"" game! With all the crudeness, juvenile gags (such as the ""You take your hand and stick it in your..."" part), etc. in ""Mallrats"", it's obvious that the movie would irk some people (I'm sure those people know who they are). However, if toilet humour, sex jokes, slapstick, immaturity, and overall insanity are things you like to see in a comedy (it may depend on what mood you're in), this silly movie could give you many laughs. Some of the crude gags may be a bit thin, but there are many good ones as well, enough to make the movie a worthy experience. This Kevin Smith film was not well-received by critics upon its release, but fortunately, it has since managed to get itself a well-deserved cult following.",Mallrats
40,DarthBill,A smart Porky's?,10,9 April 2004,"That's what Kevin Smith said the studio wanted from him when they gave him the green light on the DVD: ""They wanted us to make a smart 'Porky's'."" In fact, there was so much riding on this follow up to ""Clerks"" that there was talk of a sequel, ""Mallrats 2: Die Hard In A Mall"". Alas, the film didn't do well in theaters and a Mallrats 2 never materialized (then again, the sequel to Clerks hasn't come about yet either). Film eventually found its audience on video, and provided Ben Affleck with an early film credit before he hit it big and started a good working relationship with Kevin Smith that has lasted to this day.Jason Lee also became a Smith regular after this film and made appearances in ""Chasing Amy"", ""Dogma"" and ""Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back"".
Jason plays Brodie, a fan boy of grandiose proportions and buddy of Jeremy London's TS. TS is dumped by his girlfriend Brandi (Claire Forlani) for being obsessive and unreasonable in light of her doing her father's 70s throw back love show pilot to get him out of trouble for accidentally sending the original girl to her death via drowning. Brodie is dumped by his girlfriend Rene (Shannen Doherty) for being a loser who only plays video games, reads comic books, never takes her shopping where she wants to go and refuses to introduce her to his mother. Brodie deals with this the only way he knows how - going to the mall, which is where he spends most of his time anyway and he drags TS along with him to share in their mutual misery. There they hatch up a plan to wreck the love show so that TS can reconcile with Brandi, whom he truly loves and in fact wanted to ask her to marry him on a trip to Universal Florida that they had planned but was dashed because of the show (Brandi's dad does not like TS). Brodie also succumbs to the temptation of winning back his true love Rene, especially when he finds out that she's seeing local mall worker Ben Affleck, who has a knack for picking up women who are ""on the rebound"" from bad relationships and subjects them to his bizarre sexual fetishes (""screw them in an uncomfortable place""). Did I mention that Ben hates Brodie for having ""no shopping agenda"" every weekend that he comes to the mall? And to think he later played the comic book super hero Daredevil...

I didn't see the first one (Clerks) but I bet ya I've seen the other two (Chasing Amy and Dogma). This is the best one in my opinion Followed by Dogma and then Chasing Amy. But back to this film man. This film kicks some fu..in' awesome a.. man. I mean s..t it is great. It has like no fu..in' story or s..t and a lot of fu..in' cursing in it but it is good. I mean it basically follows two guys around that just hang out and talk. These two guys are T.S. (Jeremy London) and Brody (Jason Lee). These two guys just have had one sh.tty morning and decide to go to the mall, where they see a chance of getting even with the guys that sc..wed up their life and take up where they left. Brody is really extremely an extremely cool / sick dude in this film about nothing. He is like so gross like forget American Pie. Just listen him explain to his friend why he thinks his girlfriend left him or see him do his Stinkpalm'. This is one seriously fu..ed up dude, dude. Also watch him on the show. BRODY FREAKING RULES!!! So do Silent Bob and Jay though. OK I admit they are basket cases but they are cool. Especially Silent Bob I think. OK he don't talk too much but he's so cool with mimics and s..t that it makes him better than Jay. Last but not least I must comment on the chicks in this film. None of which seems to be remotely Normal. I mean except probably Claire Forlani. But what I am really getting at is I mean everybody is so cool in this film (except the bad guys of course)  plus they were loads of fresh faces (for that time), except Shannen Brenda' Doherty's and maybe Joey Lauren I boned Bud Bundy' Adams. On this point I want to congratulate Mr. Smith on his fabulous choice of actresses (Claire Forlani, Joey Lauren Adams and Shannen Doherty). Not only are they all pretty and gifted, but they all suit their characters very well.
Looking forward to Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, although I wonder why Smith picked that title, I mean if he was a Star Wars fan OK, but since he NEVER mentions Star Wars in his films I just can't figure it out. Plus I can't wait to see that film.
P.S.: Please re  release all Smith films on DVD so that I can finally rent or buy Clerks somewhere. I would love to see that film. DESPERATELY!!!

43,DarthVoorhees,"Cinematic Prostitution, Kevin Smith cashes in his thirty pieces of silver",1,12 February 2011,"Imagine if you will the Hollywood system taking a concept of great charm, originality, and fiery wit and thinking they can emulate it by bringing it down to it's lowest possible denominator. 'Mallrats' wishes in it's wildest dreams that it can be a 'Clerks' but unfortunately for the audience 'Mallrats' plays like a 'Meet the Spartans'-'Epic Movie' type parody of 'Clerks'. Kevin Smith is a great writer and 'Clerks' is a four star film but he is 100% to blame for the failure of 'Mallrats' and it is a failure of epic proportions.I felt as I watched the film I became detached from it as you often do with a bad movie. My mind wandered to a stupid Hollywood producer sitting above the shoulder of a Kevin Smith hot off 'Clerks' and giving him a few million dollars or so to 'reproduce' that success but to dumb it down for the masses. Smith obliged.What is the problem with 'Mallrats'? Well it plays like a bad sitcom. It's jokes are incredibly stupid and have a laugh track type quality to them. Don't get me wrong conceptually the thing is very reminiscent of the structure of the superior 'Clerks'. What 'Clerks' did that 'Mallrats' fails to do is to develop characters. Yes Dante and Randal went into filthy rants about the world but they were fully dimensional human beings with motive to their laziness and we liked them. TS and Brodie are cartoons with catch phrases and camera winking. Randal's brilliant monologue about 'Return of the Jedi' is reproduced a little bit in 'Mallrats' with references to comics and 'Star Wars' but 'Mallrats' doesn't create characters that would organically talk in that fashion. I guess that is my main problem with the picture everything seems so incredibly and painfully fake.",Mallrats
44,bopdog,"Kevin Smith may be a 'genius', but ""Mallrats"" is a poopy movie (like his others)",5,19 May 2002,"I'm a fan of ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back,"" as well as ""Dogma"" and the other Smith flicks. Smith, even when he's being corny or sophomoric or otherwise ""not real wise,"" exudes a living truth, a sense of ""art"" that provides a nice core to his movies. Who's to say exactly what 'art' is (and Lord help us when anyone tries), but for me, movies take on an importance and watchability when my experience extends beyond the mere plot. That is, when the movie somehow, and on some level, wakes me up at least a little bit, and gets me to reflect upon more than the characters on the screen.In real life, kevin Smith appears to be opinionated, arrogant, and at times a bit rude or even cruel--- but he also seems to mean well. And overall, his stuff has a wholesome and creative vibe. Having said that--- ""Mallrats"" simply isn't very good. It's OK--- but it's definitely the bottom of Kevin Smith's artsy pile.",Mallrats
45,movieguy1021,Mallrats: 7/10,7,16 July 2004,"I have finally completed seeing the five movies in he Jay and Silent Bob series by Kevin Smith. Jersey Girl obviously doesn't count. And, much like Jackie Brown completed my Tarantino films and was about third in my list of favorites of his movie, Mallrats is the same. Clerks and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back are much funnier than Mallrats, but it's better than Chasing Amy (a romantic comedy with no laughs?) and Dogma (unfunny and insulting-and I'm Jewish). So Mallrats falls right into the middle. It's not anything groundbreaking, but there's worse ways to spend 90 minutes.T.S. (Jeremy London) and Brodie (Jason Lee) have both just been dumped by their girlfriends on the same morning. They decide to take refuge in the local mall, where various wacky events occur.I've found that all Kevin Smith movies are hit or miss, and this one does both. Unlike the other four, Mallrats has some good, very funny moments, but for the most part, I wasn't laughing. I knew this wouldn't be as outrageous as his first and last films, but I was thinking some good solid laughs would come about throughout the movie. A couple chuckles here and there, but not much. On the contrary, the movie was constantly entertaining and fun to watch. I think that's what some comedy is about: entertainment more than laughs. You can relate to all the characters in one way or another. They feel almost like they're your friends. So it's basically a movie where you can just sit back, relax, and enjoy it.There are some great scenes (as to be expected from all Smith movies) here, including Willam (Ethan Suplee) trying to see a magic picture, Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Smith in thankfully large roles) trying to destroy a stage in the mall, and a topless fortune teller (Priscilla Barnes). They're all funny. The acting in this film is surprisingly good, considering this is basically a stoner comedy. Jason Lee steals the show-again. He was basically the only good part of Dogma and saved Chasing Amy. And he's great here, too. Some of the other characters aren't really developed, but it doesn't really matter. It's just an entertaining movie overall, no more, no less.My rating: 7/10Rated R for strong language, including sexual dialogue, and for some scenes of sexuality and drug content.",Mallrats
46,johnnymonsarrat,"Jon Monsarrat review: wonderful cult film, very funny",8,22 December 2002,"I caught ""Mallrats"" on TV, so they'd edited out all the swearing. But I still enjoyed it very much. It's an independent film with a lot of cult appeal. Low budget but very cool. In most movies, the romantic tension is something subtly drawn out. You know, the main character goes to the window, sighs, puts one hand on the sill, and you know that there's grief and loss.Not in this film. Instead, a dating TV game show is used as a metaphor for dating and love, and the whole thing is made explicit. It's a hilarious turn-around and there's plenty of commentary on life (deep but mostly non-deep). The acting is good, the plot has plenty of clever twists, and unlike the awful ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"", the movie fits together as a whole (not a bunch of stupid disconnected skits).Who should see this film:-- comedy lovers who won't mind the swearing and want to check out what a cult film is like.-- cult film lovers, you know who you are, a must-see-- foul mouthed post-adolescents who can't get laidI'll give ""Mallrats"" a classic but not Star Wars kind of classic 8 out of 10.",Mallrats
47,PeachHamBeach,Funnier than Clerks,9,15 April 2005,"Okay, MALLRATS was dismissed as an inferior and unworthy successor to CLERKS, but I thought 'rats was a lot more fun and a lot more funny. Plus it was in living color, which is always a plus in my book.Jay and Silent Bob are in this, and have a lot more footage than they did in Clerks. It's more farcical and less subtle comedy than Clerks, but I think Kevin Smith does great with slapstick farce comedy. It may not have a lot to say, but at the same time, the pace moves faster. Clerks was kind of slow at times.Jason Lee and Jeremy London play slacker dudes whose pretty, more serious minded girlfriends dump them for various reasons including playing too much Sega and inadventently causing aneurysms to pop. The rest of the cast, Claire Forlani, Shannen Doherty, Ethan Suplee, Renee Humphrey, Ben Affleck, Joey Lauren Adams, and the rock-climbing guy from Cliffhanger who was mad at Stallone the whole movie...anyway, they all work great together, and the story is hilarious.",Mallrats
48,AvidClimber,Mallrats — Low budget comedy and romance for some good fun,7,6 March 2013,"Mallrats is an easy comedy with romance as its reason to live. Set almost entirely in a mall and populated by its denizens, we're rewarded by juvenile arguments, pranks and stunts.Shannen Doherty is the big name of the production. She has a supporting role, playing, with a nice ring of truth, a girl who got sick and tired of her looser boyfriend, played by Jason Lee, and dumps him. Lee gives us the best performance of the cast, and with this verbose intensive role made his place on the big screen. Ben Affleck, at that time, was still relatively unknown, and even though this portrayal of an ass hole was right on target, the part was a very small one. The second main character was played by somebody that barely made the grade. His girlfriend was played by Claire Forlani who gave us a good solid performance.The story is interesting, with nice details and interesting plot twists. Even though Kevin Smith got substantially more budget this time around, the film still has an obvious low budget shine to it. Smith is slowly polishing his skills, but has yet to reach full proficiency. The dialogs and original story are is best weapons, and this piece shows that well as each scene is delivered as a verbal dance. Excellent work.Don't take it too seriously, and you'll have lots of fun.",Mallrats
49,jts0405,Mallrats is the best of Kevin Smith's movies,10,27 August 2008,"Many people criticize Mallrats and call it the worst of the View Askew movies made by Kevin Smith, but to me this is the best one. That is my opinion and I stand behind it. Let's face it Jason Lee played a better leading man than Brian O'Halloran in the previous film Clerks. I think that this movie mostly is noted the best because it truly showcases the talent of Jason Lee and is his big break through starring role. I have to say that really this beat out Clerks in it's time. If anyone disagrees then let me just say that Mallrats entertains on very comedy like levels and has a romance edge to it that leaves you pulling for Jason Lee over the villain and rival, Ben Affleck.10/10",Mallrats
50,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,9,24 November 2004,"Probably the easiest of Smith's films to watch as it is the least offensive , and is simple, dealing with situations most 18-24 year olds can relate to, although they are performed in an exaggerated state. We have Jason Lee delivering some of the best gags and quotable one-liners of the era like no other actor could, we have the stunning Claire Forlani proving that she is a far superior actress than many think, we have Jay and Silent Bob, and we have enough in-jokes and trivia to keep fans occupied for many a drunken night. The plot sees Lee and London trying to win back their girlfriends via a trip to their local Mall, using a game-show as their tool for success and redemption. There we meet William, obsessed with a 'magic eye' trick everyone but him can see, Shannon, who sleeps with any woman he can get his mitts on, and various other rejects. No drunks though, or 13 year old 'can i have a fag mate?' kids who make up the majority of my local malls. Anyway, the dialogue is some of Smith's best, each character is interesting even if we only get a small glimpse of some, and the fact that this still isn't a mainstream film even after Smith's success adds an extra charming quality. 9 out of 10",Mallrats
51,theshadow908,Hilarious comedy,8,26 July 2006,"Mallrats tells the story of two friends who are dumped by their girlfriends on the same day. They seek solace at the local mall where they hang out all day doing nothing but talk about their girlfriends and comic books. They get into a series of situations that eventually leads to the two enlisting the help of slackers Jay and Silent Bob to get their girlfriends back. This is the second film in the ""New Jersey"" series by Kevin Smith. This entry is miles better than its predecessor Clerks.I loved how Kevin Smith did this movie. Kevin Smith is a comic book geek, so I'm glad he made a movie to portray that taste. Comic book lovers will truly enjoy all the references and parodies within the film. I know I did. That's what made the movie even more enjoyable to me. The appearance of Stan Lee was the cherry on the ice cream for me. Aside from that, this movie is just paced and styled better than Clerks was. This was non stop laughs whereas Clerks was more of a satirical black comedy. Also, a lot happened throughout the film even though it only takes place within a day and within the same mall, rather than Clerks which was slow moving and downright boring in some parts.I enjoyed the acting in this movie. Jason Lee is hilarious as comic book fanatic Brodie Bruce. Jay and Silent Bob have a lot more to do in this film than in Clerks, and they make some of the funniest scenes in the movie.Overall, Kevin Smith had his practice with Clerks, so he had the resources to make a better film, and he certainly did.

53,mOVIemAN56,Everything Bio-Dome failed to be,8,5 March 2007,"Mallrats is exactly what its title says. A day in the life of two Mallrats, brought to us by none other than Kevin Smith. It follows a little more of a storyline then its predecessor Clerks. Both are written and directed by Kevin Smith. Both star almost all then unknown actors. Both are classic. But enough comparing the two comedy classics. I will move to Mallrats.The film follows a variety of then unknown actors: Ben Affleck, Jason Lee, Jeremy London, Joey Lauren Adams just to name a few. Lee and London play the leads as they both attempt to win back their ex-girlfriends at the local mall. They travel the mall with a little help from Jay and Silent Bob, two drug dealers with a sense of humor who always come in handy. London plays T.S. Quint, a young man recently dumped by the woman he wanted to marry at Universal Studios Theme Park. London isn't exactly the biggest name of actors but he does have a few good films out there. Mallrats is one of those few. His performance is believable and his comedy is great. The interaction between him and Lee is magnificent, especially in the last scene. Overall a solid job from London.Jason Lee steals the show for me. Having only done two works prior I believe Lee went into this project looking to make a name for himself. His comedy is by far the best and the way he delivers everything he says and does is just how I picture a real life Brodie Bruce acting. He is witty, he's smart mouth, he is cool, and he's a low life. How can you not love him? His last scene in the film is by far one of the funniest sequences I've ever seen.Mallrats plot isn't exactly there. Kind of like an updated Bio-Dome without stupid characters or a Dome. Unlike Bio-Dome, the actors are funny and the characters don't have to be mentally challenged to be funny. Mallrats is a classic of modern comedy. Equal with Dumb and Dumber and Happy Gilmore in laugh factors. It shouldn't be missed, there's too much to miss out on... if that makes sense.4/5 Stars",Mallrats
54,Okonh0wp,A great movie about the joy in all the little things,8,24 May 2007,"With the valuable lesson that the little nuances found by hanging out at a shopping mall are the best parts of life, Mallrats is a piece of entertainment that's humor is crude yet insightful.Jeremy London and Jason Lee as two guys who have just ended relationships, but have markedly different attitudes about it and they have a really great odd couple chemistry as a result. London plays T.S. Quint, the hopeless romantic type, not over the loss of a girl and determined to get her back that we see often in movies and in ourselves in real life sometimes. Lee's character, Brodie, is more what the movie is about. He cheers himself and his friend up by taking a trip to the mall, and indulging in the cookie stand, the comic book shop, and conspiring with two shady characters (Jay and Silent Bob) to screw over his unpleasant neighbor, who also happens to be a major reason that his friend got dumped.Whether the film portrays Brodie's lifestyle is healthy or not is debatable, he lives with his mother and lacks ambition. However, I think Lee's character is the one we admire more of the two, because he is much happier and less worrisome over the course of the film as his counterpart T.S. and still gets the girl at the end.The movie takes place over a short period of real time, pretty much, a single afternoon at the mall. Along with the two protagonists, a series of pleasantly quirky recurring characters are all found hanging out, including Joey Lauren Adams (as T.S.'s promiscuous ex-girlfriend) and Ben Affleck (as a perverted department store owner) in different roles than they'll have in Smith's future project Chasing Amy.With great dialogue as a tool, these mundane interactions between these seemingly ordinary people come to life and as a result, it becomes so engaging to watch their paths intertwine all the way to the climactic live dating show scene at the film's finale.",Mallrats
55,Ddey65,"Better than Clerks, No Matter what Anyone Says.",6,23 June 2004,"I hope nobody interprets the title of this summary as a slam against CLERKS, because that movie was good too. In his first color movie, Kevin Smith introduced us to T.S. Quint(Jeremy London), college boy with his heart set on marrying his girlfriend Brandi Svenning(Claire Forlani), and Brodie Bruce(Jason Lee), comic book collector extraordinaire who hopes for a comic shop of his own. Both lose their girlfriends for different reasons. T.S. loses Brandi over her father(Michael Rooker) a sleazy maniacal TV producer determined to do anything to keep them apart, and Renee(Shannen Doherty) dumps Brodie, because she feels her life with him is stagnating, as many in their twenties in the 1990's were. Brodie decides that the solution is a trip to the mall. At this mall, we meet Willam Black(Ethan Supplee), a doofus who wants to find a hidden picture in a painting, Tricia Jones(Renee Humphries), a 15-year-old girl who has become an expert on sex using many men and young boys as her experiments. Where were girls like her when I needed them? And best of all we meet Jay and Silent Bob, those two dope-dealers who regularly hung out in front of Leonardo, New Jersey's RST Video & Quick Stop in CLERKS. Believe it or not, it is possible to be anti-drug and still find these two funny, in fact being anti-drug HELPS in that department. With a few revelations and the help of Jay, Silent Bob, ""Trish the Dish,"" T.S.'s ex-girlfriend Gwen(Joey Lauren Adams), a freaky flea market psychic(Priscilla Barnes), and even Marvel Comics mogul Stan Lee, the tale evolves into an attempt by both to win back their significant others, however while T.S. is heartbroken through the whole ordeal, Brodie pretends he couldn't care less. T.S. & Brodie are an incongruous team dedicated to making sure that young love conquers the forces of consumerism(?), and arrogance disguised as responsibility and maturity. But this is hardly another tale of innocent youth vs. evil adults, because even some of the younger cast members are villains, like the security guards serving under the dreaded LaFours(Sven-Ole Thorsen), who don't seem that much older than the heroes and heroines of this movie, Shannen Hamilton(Ben Affleck), from the Fashionable Male clothing store, and some of Jared Svenning's employees, like ""Rowdy"" Roddy(Scott Mosier!). Hamilton is a stuck-up manager who thinks he's above everybody else and that it's his duty to seduce women who break-up with their boyfriends and have sex with them in a less-than desirable position, while pummeling people at the mall ""with no shopping agenda,"" or more accurately, not the shopping agenda he wants them to have. And it just so happens that Brodie's girl is has next target. Brandi is in nowhere near the same danger, but being forced to dump her boyfriend and replace the bachelorette on her father's retread of ""The Dating Game,"" hosted by Bob Summers(real life ex-game show announcer Art James), only to have Gwen try to coax her into returning into T.S.'s arms, doesn't help her broken heart either.Like JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK three movies later, this has an incredibly triumphant ending. Mallrats has one too, but it's also a ""so happy you'll cry"" ending. It has a wonderful outcome for the two couples and their friends, a well-deserved one for that S.O.B. from Fashionable Male, and two closing themes that'll put a lump in your throat. And as for me, I'm going to find out if Marvel Comics did publish a ""Vulture Soliloquy,"" because like Brodie Bruce a lot of what was going on in the comic book industry has passed right by me, and shouldn't.",Mallrats

61,NJMoon,MALLRATS on a Sinking Ship,4,11 September 1999,"With DOGMA due and CHASING AMY revered, we can thank celluloid heaven Kevin Smith's sophmore slump didn't last very long.  After indy mega-hit CLERKS proved his worth, Hollywood handed him carte blanche on an engraved silver salver.  By his own admission, this film could have been made for far far less than the six million the studio insisted he spend. 
Before DVD, MALLRATS was just another VHS on the previously viewed sales table.  But now, thanks to the miracle of digital technology, it is all too clear where Smith and studio went offtrack and re-defined the notion of the ""second picture jinx.""  Packed with more than an hour of deleted scenes and extras, MALLRATS' DVD gives us Smith's original intentions before Tinseltown know-it-alls put their six million cents in.  Those familiar with (what was then known as) ""The Smart PORKIES"", will be surprised to find Elizabeth Ashley as a nearly assassinated NJ Governor in a plot that was to kick off the film and would have put a wittier black-comedy slant on the proceedings to come.  Studio execs even threatened to prohibit Smith pal Jason Mewes from recreating his Jay character from CLERKS.  Fortunately, Smith won at least this little battle.Severely re-cut and toned down, MALLRATS is a shadow of what it might have been.  Aimless and bland, the film ends with a shallow and contrived game show (in a mall?!?) which brings together all it's pointless characters in one pat conclusion.  Film buffs will make the inevitable comparison to SHOCK TREATMENT, the follow-up to THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW, which also attempted to re-unite characters from the hit first flick with an imposed satire on TV and suburbia.  Maybe someday mallrats will gather at midnight screenings, inserting their own witty retorts to Smith's smart dialogue, shouting wildly at the screen and dressed just like Jay and Silent Bob!

65,kergillian,You can't go wrong with Kevin Smith!!,7,30 April 2001,"Granted, it's weaker than his other three films to date. On the other hand, a weak Kevin Smith movie is stronger than a strong film by most other writers/directors. This film is hilarious! It takes mall culture to a higher level! A good contrast to Richard Linklater's/Eric Bogosian's Suburbia, though it's better than Suburbia in most ways. Many of the pop culture refs and the satire of young adult life make this film even cooler! And how the hell did he get Stan Lee to appear? (And he was surprisingly really good!)
This is Shannen Doherty's best role (mainly because she's hardly ever on screen;), Jason Lee's best role, and Jeremy London's best role (not to be confused with twin brother Jason who was the awesome Randall Pink Floyd in Dazed and Confused...though Ben Affleck and Joey Lauren Adams were both in Dazed as well...)Look for an amusing role played by Ethan Suplee (Seth in American History X)Overall: this film just plain rocks! It's got great quirky writing, great direction, solid acting, a three-nippled topless clairvoyant, a hilarious love connection parody, a 15 year old nympho (played by the amusing Claire Forlani), Stan Lee...what more could one ask for?? It's not his best, it has flaws, but it's still classic Smith! An easy 7/10!",Mallrats
66,gtc83,"Truly, genuinely horrible",1,1 May 2004,"This movie is about two of the most unlikable, unsympathetic losers ever portrayed in recent memory.  They get dumped by their girlfriends - really they should get dumped by the entire world.  They are self-centered in the extreme, immature in the extreme, and incredibly annoying.  The whole movie is based on a single gimmick:  take an actual conversation, transcribe it into Microsoft Word, then use the thesaurus tool to replace every adjective with more obscure ones.  That's it.  It goes on without pause for the entire film - people talk about nothing in this ""clever"" way.  I just saw the film last night and I honestly can't remember a single topic of any conversation that took place.  Needless to say, the two main characters are beyond shallow.  They don't have any personalities other than that they like video games, comic books, and they just will not stop talking - ever.  Even though they never say anything.  We're supposed to be impressed by the clever use of oddball words, for instance calling a pool table a ""gaming table"". Man, wouldn't you just love to sit through two hours of people doing this?  Let me tell you, it makes Pauly Shore and his screwball take on Valley Girl talk seem enjoyable by comparison.There are other characters:  Shannon Doherty puts in a cameo.  She's really the only likable character in the movie, and says about the only funny line. Some other girl who's name doesn't deserve to be remembered plays the other loser's girlfriend.  She recites a few lines of dialog at the beginning, a few more towards the end.  Another girl named Gwen starts out all right, she's like Kelly Bundy from Married with Children, except twice as slutty, but by the end of her part she's speaking via the thesaurus as well.  Jay and Silent Bob?  Jay is a stoner who acts like he's got to go to the bathroom really bad;  Bob is just a fat idiot who spends the whole movie pointing his hand at things and trying to use ""the force"" to move objects. There's also a comic book writer who shows up to inject a large amount of padding into a scene.  The head doofus asks him if that guy from the Fantastic Four who was made out of rock, well, was his you-know-what made out of rock as well?  Is that wacky or what?  Ha ha.  This goes on and on.Overall, this movie is flat out unwatchable.  The special features on the DVD are a joke as well.  It's advertised as having over an hour of deleted scenes.  The first ten minutes of these deleted scenes consists of a film of an unused script.  Actual film of the script, you know, hold the camera in front of the paper and slowly pan down.  About two thirds of the ""scenes"" are the writer talking about the scenes.  There's supposedly a trailer on the DVD as well - good luck trying to find it.",Mallrats
67,bgaiv,Feels like a high school play with a budget,5,19 July 2021,"There's a lot of surprisingly weak acting here, surprising considering the material doesn't require much heavy lifting. It often comes across as a high school play.It seems Kevin Smith movies really click with some and not others. They don't click much for me. While there are some very funny moments, most of this film consists of lengthy rambled ""gags"" that are a chuckle at best.",Mallrats

The actors are excellent in their roles, and I was surprised to see Ben Affleck and Claire Forlani, two coming actors, credited for supporting roles.For a comic fan this movie is a awfully funny experience. But I can imagine that the film looses some of its appeal when you are not familiar with the Marvel and DC comic heroes and the strange passion (and science) of collecting comic books.And to everybody who has also failed in seeing a sailboat in those dumb 3-D-pictures, this movie provides some comfort...",Mallrats
69,allar100,Jason Lee is King!!!!,7,27 February 2003,"This is really a starring vehicle for Jason Lee.  Lee seems to be the bright point in all of Kevin Smith's films.  Technically this film is like all of Kevin Smith's others.  Not alot of camera movement, imperfect editing, the usual.  But that is not what really matters.  The story and the comedic timing is what is most important, and Smith has more than enough to go around.  7/10",Mallrats
70,nikitalinivenko,The Sophomore Slump,2,10 February 2020,"Anyone out there remember the cartoon series 6teen, about a clique of teens who work and hangout at a giant mall? Despite being made a decade earlier, Mallrats essentially plays like a live-action movie version - with more vulgarity. A fan-favorite among many of his viewers, this Jay and Silent Bob episode felt like a major step back in Smith's career. Clerks was a gruff, grungy snapshot of Gen-X that set the bar for indie movies and captured a whole generation with his unique voice - unfortunately, the same brilliance does not shine in this dull, lackluster, more traditional studio-safe follow-up. This lazy, meandering stoner/slacker cult-classic revolves around two teen losers who get dumped, their respective girlfriends, Jay and Silent Bob screwing around, Ben Affleck being a douche, and Michael Rooker the pissed-off dad who gives them all a hard time. Wackiness and antics ensue and everything is wrapped up in a neat little package, more or less. Oh, and Stan Lee has a cameo (his first, years before the Marvel movies). There's not a whole lot to say on this basic-cable video. It's fine to kill a Saturday morning if you've had a smoke and want to put on a video while you eat your Cheetos - it sure beats How High.",Mallrats
71,K-Slicer,The Force Is Strong With This One,10,7 August 2003,"When it comes to being serious, this film is frivolous with it. Of all stupid comedies I have ever seen, this one takes the Lombardi Trophy. It a smattering of silliness, sageness, and suaveness and all of these elements are harmonious with one another. ""Mallrats"" is Kevin Smith's least serious film but one of the most hilarious. I recommend this movie to all fans of stupid comedy because it is not your average stupid comedy (like Dude, Where's My Car or Dumb and Dumber).Here are my reasons (spoilers): (1) The soliloquy given by Jason Lee in the first two minutes of the film is one of the funniest yet sickest stories of all time. I couldn't contain my laughter if I died trying. I taken with the movie from then on. (2) Speaking of Jason Lee, this man is the inheritor of the title of ""smart-a** comedian"" from Chevy Chase. As I heard Lee rant, I was easily reminded of Chevy Chase but with a more caustic and angry visage. If Lee finds the right comedic roles from here on out, he could be remembered as a comedic legend. He also had the best performance in the film. (3) The silliness of ""Mallrats"" is done in exquisite fashion. The characters of Jay and Silent Bob provide the needed stupidity to Jason's Lee intelligent ranting and hilarity. I love the scenes where these boys try to turn the stage into rubble while trying to take out the head security guard. That is a recipe for multiple laughs. (4) The suaveness of ""Mallrats"" comes in with the tackling of some very adult issues in a really lighthearted fashion. The aspect of a fifteen-year old female doing every man in the neighborhood for research on a manuscript detailing their shortcomings is pretty heavy and almost sadistic stuff. The film pulls some interesting punches on the issues of sexual inadequacy, drug use, youth and authority, parenting, slacking and so on without falling into preachiness. If ""Mallrats"" had gone had tried to be serious while trying to also be slapstick, it was have fallen even further away from critics and the masses alike. (5) Kevin Smith has a knack for smart and realistic dialogue. He must be an expert eavesdropper because he had to do some sort of research to hone his wordsmithing ability. It doesn't matter if that thought is correct or not because the dialogue rules either way. I have heard people quote this movie word for word and to me, it means the writer did something right. (6) Ethan Suplee's battle with the Magic Eye poster is a jewel among all comedic sequences ever made. I really loved it when he just lashed out at those who could see the sailboat while he couldn't. Even pure, raw desperation can make for hilarious moments. (7) Ben Affleck did well as the smarmy, annoying shop manager who goes after Shannen Doherty. His pre-JLO work is among his best stuff. (8) Every town that has a 'good mall' must have a 'dirt mall' and that set of scenes really hit home for me. I worked for nine months in a 'dirt mall' and it was fun. It was one hundred times cleaner than the 'dirt mall' in the film but everybody else shopped at the big mall on the south end of the city I work and play in. It made me feel nostalgic. (9) I loved the denouement of the film. That set of sequences shows that a master hand is at work. (10) That master hand belongs to Kevin Smith and he is very talented at creating films. Even at his least serious, he can make something that will make you feel good and not stupid at the same time. The true stupid comedies always make you feel this way. Ten reasons give a score of ten.Overall, ""Mallrats"" is a stupid comedy to be reckoned with. It is silly like ""Happy Gilmore"", sage like ""Rushmore"", and suave like ""Raising Arizona"". It is rare to find a comedy that balances all three of these traits perfectly and ""Mallrats"" succeeds immensely. It is all right to keep your brain on here and it is also all right to turn your brain off as well because this is entertainment as it's finest. Here ends my rant!",Mallrats
72,TheEtherWalk,One of the funniest movies ever.,10,27 December 2008,"Kevin Smith's second film has always gotten a bum rap for some reason. Obviously it was shot on a shoestring budget, but this gives it a certain charm. The script is brilliantly written and filled with some of Smith's funniest moments. One of the main characters is a comic book fanatic, video game playing, VHS-watching generation x-er played by Jason Lee, who absolutely owns this role. This was his first major acting role and his performance is just outstanding. The other is played by Jeremy London, as the straight man of the pair, kind of like Dante was to Randal. Both of the get dumped by their girlfriends and set out to the mall to forget their troubles. To me this movie is Kevin Smith's defining moment as a filmmaker. Without Mallrats, his whole canon seems a lot less funny. How can you not love a movie with Stan Lee, a topless psychic, chocolate covered pretzels, Jaws, and a random monkey in a diaper?",Mallrats
73,themarina1,Funny - in that 90210 sort of way,7,9 August 2004,"Jay and Silent Bob keep me watching these stupid though hilarious flicks. This is no deviation. This is a funny movie about a guy who is dumped by his girlfriend (who happens to be none other than 90210 b*tch Doherty) and his buddy T.S. who is also dumped by his girlfriend. These two losers end up at the mall in an effort to win back T.S. gf. In a funny turn of events, and a meeting with Stan Lee (talking about love ha!) these two manage to get back together with their respective girlfriends. The really funny moments here are all thanks to our good buds Jay and Silent Bob. I just can't get enough of these goof balls!8/10 for the funny content (oh yeah....Affleck also makes an appearance here)",Mallrats
74,Keyser Soze-12,"It's a funny flick, but it is a bad movie",5,11 August 2001,"Sorry movie Gods, Mallrats is a bad movie.  Most people consider it to be the best Kevin Smith movie (though the critics and the box office don't agree), but it's bad.  It's still damn funny, but that doesn't make it good.First of all, the plot is horrible.  Now, let's look at Clerks for a second. It had no plot, which made it get.  IT just followed two guys around. Anything could have happened.  But Mallrats sticks itself in the side by throwing in a boring and rediculous plot.  What is it, you ask?  Two guys try to win their girl friends back.  Well, it doesn't sound that bad, but the fact the whole movie circulates around a dating game show that is taking place in a mall is sad.  It really is.  It hurts me to think that this was the best plot idea Kevin could think of.  A dating game show in a mall? Good god that is awful.Another really bad idea was Jerremy London.  The kid can't act.  It isn't all his fault because his character is the basic straight man who's only purpose in the film is to bounce the hilarious jokes from Jason Lee.  I wish Smith had taken some more time with this character, because he sucks.Third bad point: it looks and sounds like Universal just didn't care.  The music is, well, too big.  It's hard to say what I mean.  The music is really dramatic and it really doesn't fit the movie well.  There are also these weird, cartoony sound effects that come in that are just awkward.  Also, Jay's performance is a bit over the top.But, on the plus side, Mallrats is hilarious.  There are tons of funny jokes (though they sometimes aren't delevered well do to bad acting), there are some great characters (TS aside), and the witty, offensive Kevin Smith humor is all over this film.Some specific good points: The magic eye guy, the escalator joke, the cookie stand speech, Jay and Silent Bob (as usual), when Brodie is on the game show, and the ending scenes (especially when Jay and Silent Bob walk off into the sunset).Overall, the movie is weak, poorly executed, and poorly acted.  It seems more like Smith's first movie than Clerks, even though it isn't.  The whole movie seems like it was made by an amateur, which is weird, because Clerks was so well made (mostly).  But, despite this, the movie is still funny. While it is the worst Smith movie by far, it isn't the least funniest. Chasing Amy is the least funny of all his movies (due to the second half being so dramatic) and Dogma does preach too much, but Mallrats is probably his second funniest film in my opinion, with Clerks still ranking number one.Smith's movies in order of how good they are:Chasing Amy, Clerks, Dogma, MallratsSmith's movies in order of how funny they are:Clerks, Mallrats, Dogma, Chasing AmyThere ya go.  That's my 2 cents.  Well, actually that's a couple of bucks worth, but deal with it.Mallrats: a strong 5/10",Mallrats
75,Det_McNulty,"Something everybody can relate to, in one way or another. Giving you a lesson in relationships",7,21 June 2006,"Kevin Smith is a genius, I say it again and again. He just never goes wrong every single piece of his film making proves so much skill, talent and dedication it's unbelievable. I love the way everything ties in together with such ease and precision. There are not many films that manage have such amazing entertainment value. When I watch a Kevin Smith film I just sit their in hysterics. You see this is ""Clever"" comedy, it has class, style, edge, wit and sting. That's what I love about it, the fact it's ""Comedy with a bite."" I never get tired of the crazy antics of intelligent slackers. Everything so real, but yet so off the wall. You get the hilarious music playing in certain moments of the film which adds a cool goofy feel to the movie. The film sticks to same cheap feel that the masterpiece Clerks. has. This gives the true ""Indie"" spirit to the film I can watch Kevin Smith films again and again, they never lose their touch. The characters are always so cool and are exactly like people I hang around with in my day to day life. The timing as usual is something I love, they way everybody seems to know their lines but have developed them to suit their preferences.Behind all the laughs there is a very serious message and that's to make the best out of the girl your dating. You see it shows that you need to put more thought in to things and understand certain aspects of relationships. Because there will always be ""The girl that got away."" I love the respect that Kevin Smith shows to the comic book tradition and the geek factor around his films. Getting Stan Lee to have a brief stint in the movie proves this dedication and respect to the people Kevin Smith looks up to. Another obvious one is the ""Silent Bob Batman Sequence."" As usual the scripting is the best bit about the film, it truly shines with real wit and grace. Nothing gets better than consistent quotable dialogue and the dirty speeches. That's another thing the fact the Kevin Smith is never afraid to make crude jokes and manages to make movies that have a beautiful touch of realism to them. Everything around you is exaggerated in Mallrats, the set pieces, the music, the direction and sometimes the acting. You see it's all done purposely because this is Kevin Smith's world. At first glance you might think Mallrats (and other Kevin Smith films for that matter) are dumb teen comedies. They are far from it and I always find myself stressing that point. Every character times their lines perfectly and everybody has a relaxed aura about themselves. I think a lot of people only know Smith's newer films like Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back and think that's what every Kevin Smith film is like. I personally feel that Clerks., Mallrats, Chasing Amy and Dogma are masterpieces and are some of the best films ever made. One of the most underrated and ignored films of the 90s, that luckily has had a great cult status. Jason Lee acts with great talent and proves himself to be an excellent comedian. I have managed to get many friends of mine into Kevin Smith's films and they have all been impressed with his work. One of the funniest satires ever made, no doubt about it. And don't you get so annoyed when you can't see the sail boat in the 3D image!",Mallrats
76,MovieLuvaMatt,Glad it received a cult audience,7,11 July 2003,"""Mallrats"" has found a great cult audience, now that it's out on video and DVD, despite the fact that it was a huge bomb at the box office.  That's great to know.  And of course, Kevin Smith fans adore the film as well.  I happen to be one of those fans, and I always enjoy watching this movie.  It has many great lines, though in Kevin Smith tradition, sometimes he falls so much in love with his dialogue that it sometimes feels stilted.  I still love the film, but I can't deny that the dialogue doesn't always appear natural.  But at least the dialogue is intelligent, which something Smith never gets full credit for.  Critics and angry audiences spend too much time dwelling on the profane nature of his work, yet there's tons of comedies out there that are profane, but not the damn bit intelligent.  Jason Lee gives a memorable performance as Brodie.  This is the role he was born to play! He's up there with Jason Alexander when it comes to playing the neurotic best friend.  Michael Rooker also seems to be having a lot of fun, playing a great villain.  As for Claire Forlani, I can never get over her disastrous American accent.  I'm guessing she learned from her mistakes before doing other American films like ""Meet Joe Black,"" ""Antitrust"" and ""Boys and Girls.""  In all of those films, she seems to pull off the accent without a hitch.  I don't understand why the studio tried to cut down on the film's use of profanity.  Just another example of a**hole studio execs trying to take advantage of the independent filmmaker.  As if we don't see any studio films with strong pervasive language.  ""Pulp Fiction"" was also a Miramax film.  'Nuff said.  You know damn well these execs are prejudice against certain filmmakers.  I guess they just assume Smith is some young Neandrathal.  Eh, screw them.  Though I laughed a good deal, I still find the chocolate-covered pretzel gag downright disgusting.  But overall this film is definitely worth checking out!  My score:  7 (out of 10)",Mallrats
77,gothicgoblin1334,Another Awful Kevin Smith pile of crap,1,25 May 2006,"Well, another terrible film by Kevin Smith, a man whose life and career is so out-dated, it needs no introduction. What an awful movie this was, ""Mallarats"" I bet when this crap hit theatres everyone f.cking person told their friends, ""HEY--GUESS WHO WAS IN THIS MOVIE????"" .....'who?' ""JAY AND SILENT BOB!! AHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA1!!!"" Well, who were you expecting to be in this movie? Burt and Ernie? Nope, Jay and Silent BOB (Oh wow, I woonnndddeeerrr who plays him!!) as if there aren't enough butt-ugly bearded geeks in this world. Before I saw this film I thought Kevin Smith was a vulgar comic book geek who made low-budget films. Now, I just see he's an ass. I couldn't sit through this movie but somehow I did, and I think I should choke myself for making such a mistake. It's hard to sit through and hard to watch. What Kevin Smith doesn't get is that he can't always make people laugh by saying ""WORDS ABOOT SEXXX"" because it really gets old. Who the hell gets NC-17 ratings just because they say cock three hundred thousand times. I think Kevin Smith should go in the dumpster with Howard Stern and Wilt Chamberlin, along with his own two creations: Jay and Silent Bob. Oh yeah, and this film? It sucked eggs more than granny did in that egg-sucking contest (Or, at least, I THOUGHT it was an egg sucking contest) I really hate this film, I mean, I really can't stand it. When will Kevin Smith GET IT? He probably never will. But is this Kevin Smith's worst film? Not really, try Jersey Girl with Ben Asslick, it's twelve times worse.

78,tpaladino,Just Plain Bad,3,22 January 2012,"Kevin Smith is not a good director. God only knows why some people enjoy his work, and it's an even greater mystery why studios keep giving him money to make his awful films. The only decent movie he's ever made was 'Zack and Miri', and that was because he deviated almost entirely from his usual style. Mallrats, however, is typical of his style. The writing is bad, the jokes are bad, the setups are bad and the plot is bad. It's nearly unwatchable. You have zero sympathy for the protagonists, who are hopeless losers, and the secondary characters are no better. Oh, but that's the point, some would say... it's suburban nihilism. Its the essence of '90s teen angst and slacker culture. It's brilliant! Nope, sorry. Not buying it. I was a teenager in the '90s. I lived through it. And believe me, this film is garbage, just like the rest of the Kevin Smith 'ode to slackers' collection, including the inexplicably beloved Clerks.",Mallrats
79,ericjg623,"Fly, fatass, fly!",8,13 January 2003,"This is Kevin Smith's first `real' movie, i.e., one made with a real budget, real actors, and backed by a real studio. It was also a commercial and critical flop, most reviewers seem to regard it as his worst movie. That is understandable, seeing as he set such high expectations with `Clerks', a work of pure genius that was made on a budget so low that Smith was forced to use black & white film. `Clerks' is one of my all time favorite films, a classic that will probably still be popular many years from now, and so, by comparison, `Mallrats' simply doesn't measure up. But so what? It's still a great comedy, with lots of moments that make you want to split a gut, and is, IMHO, better than at least 90% of the other teenage/young adult movies out there.The story (as with most comedies) is pretty basic. It's about a day in the life of two slackers who both get dumped by their girlfriends that morning. They then spend the rest of the day hanging around the mall (in an ironic touch, the mall in question, while supposedly set in New Jersey, is actually about five miles from where I live, in the Minneapolis suburb Eden Prairie) trying to figure out how to win back their girls. Along the way they encounter Kevin Smith's trademark ensemble of oddball characters, most notably Jay & Silent Bob who give what I think are their funniest movie performances. Kevin Smith continues themes established in `Clerks' (and repeated in his following movies) namely, homages to Star Wars, Jaws, and hockey and throws in some new ones, most notably, comics and video games. As in `Clerks', nothing much really happens, the two, as the tagline puts it, aren't at the mall to work or to shop, they're just there. Well, not entirely. Amid their random meanderings and encounters with other Kevin Smith favorites like Ben Affleck and Joey Lauren Adams there is an actual plot, namely, one of the guys is scheming to wreck a TV game show to be broadcast live at the mall later that day and he enlists Jay and Silent Bob to do the dirty deed. Why? Well, it's too complicated to explain in a brief review, but the payoff is hilarious. Whatever else one thinks of this movie, it has to be about the best send up of game shows ever as the dynamic duo infiltrate a Dating Game rip-off and turn the whole thing into a circus. The final 20 minutes or so of this movie is simply some of the funniest stuff you'll see anywhere.What about the rest? Mostly it's pretty good, although Kevin Smith's penchant for pushing the envelope means he sometimes goes too far when it comes to matters of taste, most notably scenes like the infamous `chocolate pretzel' and a former `Three's Company' star playing a topless fortune teller, not to mention the 15 year old girl who's doing a `science project' that involves having sex with multiple men of varying ages. Also, Smith seems to have some sort of fixation on homosexuality that keeps coming up (pardon the pun) in his movies. Is he simply using gay jokes as a means of getting a cheap laugh or is this his way of working out some personal `issues'? I don't know and, further, I don't care because I think there are better, more creative ways to get a laugh. But, these complaints aside, this movie is still funny as hell, and, as with `Clerks', Smith proves he has a good ear for tunes to accompany the film, especially in the title sequence which features all the characters drawn comic book style. Very original, and it works perfectly. One final comment: I personally think the best way to watch his movies is to view them in order; this, for example, gives us the same basic slacker attitude and mentality of `Clerks', only in color and with a much bigger budget. He then went for the `quality' flick with `Chasing Amy' followed by the `issues' flick in `Dogma', finally returning to pure comedy in `Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back'. For one, the movies are all related, and each new one refers to his previous ones. Many of the jokes only make sense if you understand the context. And also, someone who saw the much more dramatic and polished `Chasing Amy' first and this film later might tend to dismiss it as sophomoric trash, not realizing that Smith got his start doing pure comedy, not romantic drama. In sum, this is a film in the tradition of `Airplane!' or `Scary Movie' in that it's all about going to any length to get a laugh, and, for the most part, it succeeds splendidly.8/10PS. As with all his other movies, Kevin Smith goes to considerable length to please his fans with his DVD's. They are all chock full of extra features, deleted scenes and the like, and his commentaries are some of the best in the movie business. Smith obviously knows he has a highly loyal fan base, and he returns that loyalty in spades.",Mallrats

If you want to watch a great comedy, I recommend it.The dialog is fresh and almost every guy who has had his heartbroken can totally relate to the story, since the concept revolves around two guys who get dumped by their girlfriends.

82,neon47,Good and Okay,7,6 June 2005,"Kevin Smith is great. He really is a genius when it comes to movies. Mallrats is his second movie out of five. The movie starts off with two guys being dumped by their girlfriends. So what's a guy to do once he's dumped? Go to the mall, why? Well because there's comic books, food, and a chance to win back the girls. A bind date television show is being held at the mall that day and one of the girls fathers produces the show. From there all that's left to do is either a: get on the show or b: sabotage the show. With a little help from Jay and Silent Bob nothing in the world can go wrong. Unless an angry Ben Aflleck is trying to get on your ex, or your ex's father who produces the show really hates you. Overall the movie is pretty good. I wasn't laughing out loud but I did snicker a lot. The plot to the movie drags a little but it holds up. Some of my friends were praising this movie but I don't see a reason to praise it. But there's really no reason to hate it. If you like Clerks then this movie is something you're gonna want to see.

But when it comes to Mallrats?I love this movie. When I first saw it, I didn't think it was anything special. I saw it after the resurgence of teen sex comedies in the latter half of the 90's. When compared to those this movie is just common place drivle. BUT when placed in context, it restarted the whole genre. Granted I have grown to hate the genre as of late, but that is mostly because they don't have any Jason Lee, who's first feature was this film.But the main reason I am back into my worshiping Kevin Smith mode, because of the DVD. I just got a DVD player about a month ago and have already gotten most of my favorite movies on DVD. I got Fight club, Chasing Amy, American Beauty (which has a crappy commentary, but that's not important), Se7en and a few others. I really wasn't planning on getting Mallrats, except for two things 1)My friend got it and told me it was a great dvd 2)this guy was selling it along with clerks on an unnamed auction internet site for less than what the clerks DVD cost and I wanted the clerks DVD.But anyway. I got it and I have to say that I now see why so many people don't like this movie. the Plot was taken out. I mean It still had its little bon mo's (Like a little French don't you), but the main plot was gone and it was here on the DVD under deleted Scenes. Because of this excellent dvd have to give this movie a 10/10",Mallrats
85,simplysoda_19f,Mallrats is cool!,10,15 October 2006,"OK, so I was going to the mall the other day and I saw two guys just hanging out at the mall walking around, not buying anything, and I thought of this movie. Jason Lee (star of ""My Name is Earl"") plays Brody and Jeremy London plays T.S. Quint, two guys who just hang out at the mall all day, because well...they have nothing better to do. This movie is definitely one of the better movies in the Kevin Smith series. I loved it because they took 2 guys, who are just like pretty much everybody else, yes, they have relationship issues, and they still live at home with their parents, and enjoy comic books and video games, but they made them 2 of the main characters. Kevin Smith stars again as Silent Bob, and of course we have Silent Bob's side-kick Jay (Jason Mewes).This movie is really funny, and it made me a huge fan of Jay and Silent Bob, oh and of course Jason Lee. I didn't really knew who Jason Lee was when I first watched this movie like over 10 years ago, but now I am definitely a HUGE fan of his. My school guidance councellor asked me what I wanted to be in the future, I didn't see geeks who hang out at the mall all day on there. Oh, by the way watch for Ethan Suplee who also stars in Earl as the ""magic eye guy"". It's funny because like Ethan Suplee I can't seem to find the darn picture no matter what I do.So to sum it all up, it's pretty funny, it's got a great cast, there's a couple of other names in the cast, Shannon Dogherty and Joey Lauren Adams to name a few of them, oh did I mention comic book genius Stan Lee is in it as well. Yes, it's a good movie, very funny, great cast and there's a lot of laughs to be had. I don't want to spoil anything....but you got to hear Jason Lee's ""cat"" story at the beginning of the movie, and that is why I gave this movie 10 out of 10.",Mallrats

Like a modern grunge Woody Allen, Smith's words are delivered by actors with good timing (unlike ""Clerks"") Smith leaves no stone unturned in his spoof of our weekly marketplace, the Mall. Jeremy London and Jason Lee play two recently dumped pals that go to shop for girls at their local mall, but what they find is their old girlfriends (of course) and a heap of trouble.

93,bhicks56,i smell a rat,5,23 November 1999,"I have mixed feelings about MALLRATS. It was semi-funny, with mostly good talent, a bigger budget, and COLOR!But the movie, overall, seemed like a waste of a bigger budget.Even Kevin Smith, the writer/director/co-star of the lukewarm follow-up to his much more genius CLERKS, thinks so.I puzzled over why, and this is what I came up with:The setting itself is way too tacky. A mall. It's much more bigger than a convenience store or video store, but with the extension of size, you expect more action. And there's not much you can do in a mall, though this movie strives to disprove that. But do we really need the villainous mall security and a hokey game show going on?Then there's Jeremy London, who does a really bad acting job as the lead. If he wasn't teamed up with the much more comedic and interesting Jason Lee, the movie would reek itself to death. Don't get me wrong, I liked Jeremy London in DAZED & CONFUSED, but here he looks like some sort of trespassing member of the ""Kevin Smith Movie Club"", which, I think, Jason Lee reigns here. Let's face it, he's no Ben Affleck.But the whole story is kinda crummy. Especially the whole tedious game show finale. Uggh.. there were some moments that looked like gems (the Jay & Silent Bob BATMAN parody, the ""Get that kid off the escalator!"" bit), and some that looked like a waste (the lackluster Stan Lee cameo, the fortune teller with an 'interesting deformality'). But the only thing keeping it all alive is Kevin Smith's one-of-a-kind dialogue.This is the low point of Kevin Smith's slackers in Jersey trilogy, but don't be discouraged! He finishes very nicely with his best film to date (though I haven't seen DOGMA yet), CHASING AMY!",Mallrats

95,Pythe,"Good movie, bad ending",7,15 November 2007,"Mallrats, Kevin Smith's second and most maligned film until Jersey Girl, isn't really that much of a stretch from Clerks. Mostly it just feels like a movie that got taken away from its creator by the studio system trying to make it more marketable--every filmmaker has at least one such experience. Still, Smith's comedic brilliance shines through in the writing. Characters are still aimless losers with nothing better to do than hang out and have epic conversations about meaningless nonsense--one of my favorite such discussions revolves around whether the cookie bakery is regarded as part of the food court, and another pontificates on Superman's romantic life. As with Clerks, the protagonists are experiencing miniature crises with their girlfriends, the resolution of which leads to the obvious but not heavy-handed moral Smith always interjects in his films.My only real complaint is the artificially ""feel-good"" ending, which feels too trite and sensational for what had, for the previous seventy minutes or so, been such a down-to-earth, slice-of-life comedy. It's like a bad Adam Sandler movie, the kind that always seems to end with cheering crowds and joyfully tearful make-up smooches. The bad guy gets his comeuppance, the lovable characters go on to fame and fortune, and everything is wrapped up in a neat little package. One of the things I love about Clerks. is that the ending, while resolving the conflict, ends without tying all the loose ends together. While Smith generically employs happy endings, they usually don't feel quite as predictable and saccharine. I've never heard him speak out on the subject, but I get the feeling the new ending was probably tacked on as the result of poor test screenings, or changed at the script stage because of the asinine notes studios like to give to more inexperienced indie directors.The cast is great. Jason Lee, of course, steals every scene he's in, even though he's supposed to be the ""sidekick"" here. He's a talented actor, and it's too bad that, with the possible exception of The Incredibles and My Name is Earl (I've only seen a few episodes), he's never been utilized quite as effectively as he is in a Kevin Smith movie. Jason Mewes, mercifully, retains the role of Jay in spite of the studio's wishes, and is as always a foul-mouthed fireball of energy. Joey Lauren Adams is suitably adorable, even in her role as a cheating ex. Shannen Doherty is wonderfully spirited and appropriately irritable without coming across as shrewish or horrible. Jeremy London performs his ""straight man"" role admirably, though since his job is to react to the lunacy around him more than participate in it, the audience never sympathizes with him the way we should--perhaps a bit of underwriting on Smith's part. Claire Forlani is cute enough, but her performance feels sort of flat for some reason.Mallrats, while it definitely suffers from sophomore slump, is still a great entry in the Jersey Chronicles, and has more than enough redemptive qualities to put it in a league far above 90% of most studio comedies.",Mallrats

101,conspracy-2,Well-executed farce,7,20 May 2000,"This movie should not be seen as more than a farce. With that point of view, it hits right on the money. The plot itself is about two guys, both dumped by their girls on the same day. They go through a menagerie of the weirdest, funny characters on their realization that they want them back, and can get them.The acting does smack of low-budget, especially Jason Lee, the Kevin Smith regular, who is nowhere near as compelling as he is as Azrael in 'Dogma'. But it doesn't matter. (A little irrelevant point of interest: Renee Humphrey, who plays the 15-year old sexologist, beat Jennifer Love Hewitt for the role. A little nugget of information for ya there)On the way, the two kiddos engage in long dialogues with no cuts. This is not as distracting as it was in 'Jackie Brown', because the direction suits their rambling, yet highly eloquent, discussions. They also come into contact with more or less relevant characters, each with a huge funny character flaw or idiosyncracy. Ivanna, the topless psychic qualifies as one of strangest and funniest bit-part characters.Most of the strange little interludes, that were just funny in the beginning, come together in the climax, and this works well. The Silent Bob/Gwen unintentional stalker-love interest doesn't go anywhere, which is a little disappointing.

It's one of the funniest, and most entertaining pieces of cinema to come out in the 90's. So saying that it's a weak Kevin Smith movie, is basically saying that it's a hilarious movie. It follows the misadventures of two best friends, comic book addict Brodie (Jason Lee), and devoted boyfriend T.S. (Jeremy London). They are both dumped by their girlfriends on the same morning. Brodie's girlfriend, Renee (Shannon Doherty), dumps him because of his addiction to video games, comic books, and neglecting her. T.S.'s girlfriend, Brandi (Claire Forlani) dumps him because of an act of insensitivity that made her have to participate on a dating game show, hosted by her uptight dad (Michael Rooker). They end up spending a day at the mall, which is full of quirky characters, such as a 15-year-old girl who is doing research for a sex book, a topless fortune teller with three nipples, Jay (Jason Mewes), and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith).That's basically the whole plot. Most of it works very well. Jay and Silent Bob are hilarious as always, and the topless psychic is one of the most hysterical scenes ever. Brodie's reaction is hilarious. Jason Lee gives a flawless comedic performance. He knows really well how to deliver his lines. Everything that comes out of his mouth is priceless humor. I don't think I've ever seen a greater comedic role from anyone.

105,Lunchbox-8,A hilarious and somewhat offending comedy with great dialogue and acting.,9,5 June 2000,"""Mallrats,"" now there is a great movie.  If you are a young viewer, then this movie will be like a ""Casablanca"" to adults.  The Kevin Smith series of movies is the eqivalent of the John Hughes 80's series but only for the 90's.  This movie is so funny, you will be rolling on the floor.  The now somewhat famous duo, Silent Bob and Jay, are featured in their second film, which made them more popular with the younger crowd.  ""Clerks"" is of course a ""classic"" 90's movie that deserves enough praise as it is.  But to tell you the truth, ""Mallrats"" was the first of the series that I experienced. Immediately after viewing this film I was hooked.  For about two months, I thought so highly of Kevin Smith he was like a second Speilberg.  That era of Smith praise existed until I realized that this movie was made for teens. So, I kind of covered up my obsession with these movies for a while.  But, now I'm back, and I'm ready to summarize this fabulous film.  The movie ""Mallrats"" is a great movie for countless reasons.  First of all, the dialogue in this film is superb.  Like in all Kevin Smith films, the dialogue is filled with minute, extraneous jokes that are, in the least, hilarious.  Now, Silent Bob and Jay are featured as a pair of rebellious young adults who are focused on creating pranks that will cause havoc in the large mall that is the primary setting.  Jay is a talkative, irreverent criminal like delinquent; his counterpart, on the other hand, is a silent(that is kind of implied) character who provides humor, not because of jokes or dialogue, but just because he never talks.  The plot of this movie is, although simple, provides a story that is pretty interesting.  To really understand these comments on ""Mallrats,"" see this movie.  You'll enjoy it more if you're young, but if you're old, so what.  Enjoy this hilarious and irreverent film for what it is: a well-written movie that deserves praise.",Mallrats

107,andrewhumphreys9968,Mallrats - 8/10,8,6 September 2020,"While it doesn't quite pack the same punch as Kevin Smith's self-funded feature debut Clerks, Mallrats is still a more than worthy follow up and is the grounds for so much of the stuff going ahead in the View-Askiewniverse, including Jason Lee's comic-obsessed Brodie. It follows two friends, both recently dumped by the girlfriend's, who seek solace at their local mall, which is host to a variety of memorable Smith characters and easily misinterpreted, dirty store names.Speaking of comics in particular, their influence on Smith and his films are established here a lot more than they were in Clerks, most notably in the form of a cameo from the iconic Stan Lee. The opening credits also feature original artwork of the cast as superheroes and it's very well done, including glimpses at what would become Bluntman & Chronic in Chasing Amy. The soundtrack is also worth mentioning, it's a little dated, but there are some good songs in there and it fits the tone of the movie.Despite its bigger budget, there's still those seemingly random conversations and interactions that Smith is known for, including a great story about airplanes from Brodie. On top of the previously mentioned Stan Lee, the film also sees lots of Smith's other friends make appearances, including a cameo from Clerks' Brian O'Halloran, but the main cast includes Ben Affleck, Joey Lauren Adams and Shannon Doherty. Michael Rooker also stars as the movies antagonist and it's always nice to see him, the film does a good job at making his scenes feel like he's a comic-book villain, which goes with their clear influence on the film.Overall, you can still tell this is a Kevin Smith movie right from the opening voiceover. The premise itself, along with the wardrobe and dialogue, are all very much in line with Smith's established style at the time. It succeeds in terms of its cast, characters and comedy and features a bit more of Jay & Silent Bob.

As a movie, I saw it get judged and snubbed by the film buffs, but let me disagree here, take Mallrats for what it is, an entertaining portrait of consumerism counter-culture.Petulent formula you might say? Well think about it. Mallrats has been made in 1994 and was portraying the first generation of grown up kids put up face to face with mass capitalism. As the portrait shows kids with mixed up feelings and a sense of confusions towards this abundance, it remains fun.Thats what Mallrats is. Pure fun. Kids forming their identity against all the abundance of stuff pushed down their throat. Crazy situations in a mall, epic story of reconquering your true love...in a mall...are they buying stuff? No. Sometimes you almost forget the thing is in a goddamn mall.I've had fun with this movie. Brodie Bruce is the prime example of the empty criticism towards his generation. Its not what you do that defines who you are, its who you are that defines what you do.Pure non-arrogant fun, killer dialogues and a legacy that lives on. Thanks Kevin Smith",Mallrats
110,Artêmis,The funniest movie I've ever seen (until next week),9,19 December 1999,"A time ago, when I was 13, I used to love malls just as Brodie do in this movie. I wanted to do everything at the mall. Watch a new movie? In the mall theatres. Buy a new clothe? In the mall. Eat something? In the mall. One day I was reading my TV guide when I saw a movie called ""Barred in The Mall"", Mallrats' Brazilian name (note: the Brazilian name for ""Beverly Hills, 90210"" was ""Barred in The Prom""!). Obviously, I wanted to watch but, I don't know why, I didn't.One year after it all my sisters started to talk about one movie named ""Chasing Amy"": ""Chasing Amy is the funniest movie of the world"", ""great movie"", ""there's a lesbian"",""Ben Affleck is hot""... Everywhere I went there was somebody talking about this movie. And I was really interest about it because the plot is really great. I wanted to watch it but, I don't know why, I didn't.Some months ago I was reading a magazine and there was a report about the polemic ""Dogma""."" What a great movie"", I thought. ""I must watch it"". So, somehow, I have no idea, I connected Dogma with Chasing Amy and I discovered that the director and writer of both was Kevin Smith. Some months after it, I was still thinking about Dogma (you know, they're trying to cancel it here and I was very angry. They said that Alanis Morissette is a ""pop singer that sings naked in her shows"") and reading the TV guide I found ""Barred in the Mall""! And somehow I discovered that it was from Kevin Smith. I was happy but in fact I hadn't watched any Kevin's movie yet. That would be the test.
The result is that Mallrats is a great movie. It's very very funny, different, independent, strange, everything! The cast is superb (specially Jeremy London, Shannen Doherty, Jason Mewes and Claire Forlani) and each new scene is better. At the end, the only thing you can do is laugh more and more (and with that end, it's impossible not to laugh). And the screenplay is for sure the best thing in ""Mallrats"" and you can see it looking at the memorable quotes. The scene where a TV-show is being made in the mall is the unforgettable. And Jay is the funniest character of the movie (and he's in Dogma, Chasing Amy and Clerks too!).Other fun thing is that many character from ""Mallrats"" are in other Kevin's movies and many actors and actresses are too but playing different characters!So, why is Mallrats the funniest movie I've ever seen only  until next week? Well, because when I was talking to one friend he said: ""Mallrats? It's very good but Chasing Amy is better. And have you ever watched Clerks? I think it's Kevin's  best.""  So I went to IMDb and ""Mallrats"" is the worst rated movie from Kevin! I can't wait. In the next weekend, I'm going to rent both. And in January 14th maybe everything will change again. Dogma will be released in Brazil!In summary, using only 6 millions dollars Kevin did the funniest movie I've seen. That proves that the most important is the screenplay, not expensive sceneries.

You talk about nothing.Jay and Silent Fat **** is in the film too as always of course, with Silent bob being a little too obsessed with Batman and Star Wars. I'm a teenager and I'm sorry, I can't find many arguments on how the is a good movie but I can tell you this, this film inspires people, it inspires me, it inspires by friends and many others mainly because of its use of diauloge and referencing of the things that I love which makes me more and more interested in watching the film from every word ever said in the film.As for the Dawn Of The Dead thing, it comes from a discussion I had with a fellow living-dead chum I have, saying that Kevin Smith is just like Romero! He started out in a confined area with Clerks, shot in black and white and then moved on to the shopping mall in color! Sounds ridiculous I know but it's kind of a neat little theory I think.",Mallrats
114,yearspew,Decent Enough Comedy.,8,21 June 2008,"I have enjoyed pretty much every Kevin Smith movie. I have some favorites like Clerks, Clerks II and Chasing Amy. And some that I consider funny enough but lacking something to make them a favorite of mine. Mallrats is one of those movies.Smith's previous movie Clerks is my favorite of his. I did not expect another Clerks in Mallrats and I wasn't disappointed with the result. I think Mallrats works as a simple 80's style comedy, yet trying to maintain elements that made Clerks such a great film.The main characters T.S. (Jeremy London) and Brodie (Jason Lee) are, in a way, the Dante and Randal (the protagonists of Clerks) of this movie. The character traits are similar, T.S. would be Dante, the straight man, and Brodie would be Randal, the ""wacky"" funny one.The big, and I mean big difference is that both characters from Clerks are equally interesting. This is not the case in Mallrats. While Brodie Bruce is perhaps the funniest and most memorable character in the movie, T.S. feels like a dull, weakly-written character that doesn't get any better with Jeremy London's acting. Jason Lee is hilarious, but his weak buddy hurts what could have been a memorable partnership.As for the story, it's alright. I cannot praise it much but I can't bash it either.The supporting characters are, however, very good. Ethan Suplee as Willam Black aka the sailboat guy is very funny, and Michael Rooker as Mr. Svenning is a scene-stealer sometimes. The girls (Shannen Doherty and Claire Forlani) did a decent job, but nothing remarkable about it. And of course Jay and Silent Bob who are always great. This is the first movie, though, to feature the current version of Silent Bob. That is a more animated and lively Bob, as opposed to the serious, more introverted version from Clerks.So, to finish, Mallrats is a movie I enjoy, but one that does not get better with each viewing. Still, good for laughs.",Mallrats
115,Paguma,The laughs continue,9,7 August 1998,"Although I feel Clerks is better, this is a very good continuation of the style Kevin Smith has created. I loved this movie. It again tells the story of some less than impressive individuals and the hilarious events that transpire in their day. Just read the amount of quotes that the IMDb has for these movies, and you get the idea. The dialogue in all of Kevin Smith's movies is the focal point, the plots almost seem irrelevant to me.",Mallrats
116,Omne,I'd say the weakest of Smith's movies,6,31 March 2002,"Mallrats isn't a bad movie but it lacked something. While thinking about this comment it came to me. It lacked engaging comedic characters.In Clerks the verbal byplay between Dante and Randal kept the movie going. In Dogma the commentary and byplay from Rickman, combined with Chris Rock's work made it worth watching. Even in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back the supporting actors kept it going with clever exchanges.Chris Rock as the psychotic militant black director comes to mind.In Mallrats, outside of Jason Lee as Brodie, there really wasn't anybody that was very funny. Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith lighten things up with their usual slapstick but they are only in the movie sporadically. The other actors just play the normal Hollywood supporting cast, and dully at that. Jason Lee would make some clever comment and the rest of the cast more or less just stared at him. Having just watched Clerks again a couple of days before seeing Mallrats I really noticed the differences between them, and how much better Clerks was.
It's an interesting movie in terms of watching Kevin Smith's evolving style but on it's own it stands as pretty weak compared to his other films.",Mallrats
117,lilant,Mallrats no hoodrats,10,11 August 2001,I like to go to the mall so this movie is for me  . I love this one it's not smiths best but you can deal with that.

118,scoopcc,Bottom line: It is funny and somewhat good.,8,1 October 1999,"After seeing Mallrats for the first time, I was quite amused. When I told a friend how much I liked it, he said, ""It was crap."" This floored me, and he followed it up with ""...and Kevin Smith said as much.""
Well, regardless of what Smith said, I think his work was just fine. While it might not be the artistically correct thing to do (go big $$$), Mallrats made his work more accessible to people who go to theaters or rent videos to have fun, not to be a critic. I know several people who were scared off by the black and white of Clerks, the lack of name power in Clerks (especially when it came out--who knew Jason Mewes before Clerks?). And these were educated movie-goers, not simps. After seeing Mallrats, they gave Clerks a try and were even more impressed. Good for Kevin, he opened the door for more people to experience his masterpiece by putting out a decent slapstick comedy. Marketing at its best. Only if he had put up a Web site ""telling the story of two young men who went to the mall after being dumped. Nine hours later, their ex's were found...."", he would have beat the Blair Witch boys to the punch!Anyway, the movie is dominated by Jason Lee's strong performance as Brodie, and I was also happy with Ben Affleck's role as Shannon Hamilton. Jeremy London's delivery of Kevin Smith dialogue left a little to be desired, but all in all, it was pretty well done. Jay and Silent Bob were the only characters who made the movie seem overly silly. I still take great pleasure in watching these scenes: 1.) Brodie's basement after the dumpings; 2.) Stinkpalm; 3.) the game show. The first time I heard Brodie's response to the whoopee question (not just the f-word, but the sounds he makes), I completely lost it.This comedy can be enjoyable. Try to go into this movie with an open mind, not thinking you're watching ""Clerks 2"" or something. And yes, that's a recommendation.",Mallrats

122,to_kill_better,Utterly Class,10,10 January 2003,"The publicity for this film totally did not do it justice. Rather than a run-of-the-mill teen flick as the posters imply, or a weak and uneven comedy as the critics say, this is a stylish, funny and witty comedy/parody. The only problem that immediately hits the viewer is that the delivery of the dialogue is a bit stilted, but that's just the style in many of Kevin Smith's films and it just adds to the tongue-in-cheek atmosphere. The characters are all likeable charicatures and the over the top cartoony humour is a perfect antidote to the usual oh-so-sincere heartfelt nonsense in teen romance films. Mallrats is also the movie which makes best use of loveable pot-heads Jay and Silent Bob. Their small cameo appearances manage to almost steal the film as every short snippet is hilarious, rather than dragging the jokes out until they aren't funny as in Dogma. It's really hard to express how much this ISN'T a typical teen comedy in the vain of American Pie, it's almost the anti-Pie! The humour varies from wit to slapstick and the plot falls together at the end in a wonderful fantasy ending. This is also the only romantic comedy I've ever seen that appeals to guys!This is one damn funny movie and everyone should buy the video immediately.",Mallrats

These two guys go to a mall and do basically nothing except walk around and comment on the stores, the people, and themselves in witty sarcastic ways inspired by their observations of the vulgar and the profane. One guy, played by the guy who plays Earl in the TV show ""My Name is Earl"", doesn't give a s**t about anything, hates everything and finds joy in the existence of being miserable. He tries to convince the other guy that he is better off. But wait. Even though it's true there is a reason. That's because the other guy is just a whiny bitch who is there trying to figure out how to win his girlfriend back. The whiny bitch is somewhat necessary because he's like a lot of modern guys, trendy, useful and easy for most women (and employers) to put on a leash. He's probably considered handsome by most sluts (and fags (and employers)) and because of his girlfriend problem propels the plot or what little there is of it onward towards it's comically nihilistic though predictable ending. During the course of this affair all sorts of colorful, odd and even despicable characters cross their paths rendering entertaining doses of chaos and banality in equal measures.

125,Mercader79,Claire Forlani's best film! (apart from Basquiat),7,24 April 2001,"Was ever a film so unfairly maligned as Mallrats? Kevin Smith's follow-up to the sublime Clerks was savaged by the critics and went down like a lead balloon at the U.S box office. It didn't even get a cinematic release in Britain, where Time Out labelled it 'a depressing mess'. It is difficult to see why.True, it suffers in comparison to Clerks, but then most comedies released in the last ten years do. I also personally found some of the occasional slapstick and crudity a bit much although compared to the recent lamentable spate of Farrelly brother comedies and their ilk this seems tame indeed.The truth is that Mallrats is an enjoyable if hardly groundbreaking film, easily on a par with the much better received Chasing Amy and far superior to the diasatrous Dogma. The lack of cinema release in the U.K was in fact hardly a tragedy as (as the director freely admits) Kevin Smith's films are hardly very cinematic anyway. Comedy, Stan Lee, Star Wars discussions and the delightful Claire Forlani. What more could one want?",Mallrats

This guy is a natural actor, seeing that this was his first movie, and that he was a former skateboader before, he should have won an oscar by now.

129,glassorange,The bottom of the Kevin Smith barrel,5,1 March 2002,"Kevin Smith is a great filmmaker.  Unfortunately, most great filmmakers have their occasional not-so-great films (See Oliver Stone's ""U-Turn"" or Martin Scorsese's ""New York, New York""), and for Smith, that film is ""Mallrats."" This movie isn't by any means horrible.  There are some very big laughs, as there always are in Smith's films.  However, ""Mallrats"" gets itself mixed up in a lame storyline and feeds the audience a number of cliches, such as the incompetent security guards and a character played by my worst enemy, Ben Affleck, who it would simply waste valuable seconds to describe.  If you've never seen a Kevin Smith film in your life, PLEASE do not start with this one.  Each one of his other films give us a much better storyline: ""Clerks"" observes the lives of, need I point out, clerks in New Jersey; ""Chasing Amy"" involves a heterosexual male, who's best friend is homophobic, and who falls in love with a lesbian; ""Dogma,"" Smith's very best film, deals with Catholicism in a way that manages to be hilarious while avoiding offesniveness; and finally ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" which sends Smith's characters (played by Jason Mewes and Smith himself) on a series of adventures on their own, with great in-jokes that are especially funny if you've seen the previous Kevin Smith films.The bottom line is this: If you want to see a film with a good storyline, do your best to avoid ""Mallrats"".

In my opinion both Dogma and Chasing Amy get way too preachy.  I loved Clerks and put that up above Dogma and Chasing Amy as well.  This movie is funny and entertaining, which is a quality rarely seen.  Most moves are just a few funny parts surrounded by really boring parts.

131,aaronsciortino,Boring directing work,4,23 January 2021,"How to direct a Kevin Smith movie:
Hold the camera infront of the characters while they talk. That's it. Just keep the same shot going for the entire scene and don't even bother trying to anything remotely interesting with the camera work or filming equipment. Just as long as you can see the characters and hear them talking, that's all that matters.Complaints aside, a lot of the dialogue in the script is pretty funny which I give it some credit for, I'd be lying if I said the movie just wasn't funny at all. Although at the same time as having funny dialogue, it's also excruciating to watch with how unbelievably boring the camera work is, how basically it's directed and how little thought or effort is put into the direction work. It's like there wasn't even a storyboard drawn for it, they just decided to hold the camera infront of the characters so you can see them talking and did this for every scene in the movie without even bothering to think of any interesting shots. Probably the worst and most boring cinematography of any movie ever. Also, it barely has a plot. It's just about two guys going to hang out at the mall cause they got dumped by their girlfriends? Could be somewhat interesting if they got up to a bit more while they were at the mall but most of it was just watching them walking around and their day at the mall wasn't even that eventful for a movie",Mallrats
132,Shaf-2,A study in contrasts...,6,23 January 1999,"Kevin Smith is one of the most gifted writers in the business, and I am continually impressed with his gift for natural dialogue, his knack for the outrageous, and his entertaining, interlinking world filled with interesting, complex characters (in their own ways, at least).  Mallrats possesses all of these traits, it is at times hilarious and often entertaining, and yet, seemingly through force of sheer will, it has been transformed into a fairly bad movie.On his website, Smith states that his goal was to attempt to breathe life back into the raunchy, R-rated teen comedy, and among other influences, he cites ""Porky's.""  I state this as a warning.  And it shows: what results is a movie where a third of the time you're rolling in laughter, and two-thirds of the time you're staring at the screen in a stupified trance as the central characters attempt to deal with their relationship difficulties in increasingly moronic, unfunny fashions.  Smith has shown, in both Clerks and Chasing Amy, that he's capable of better.No movie with Jay and Silent Bob can be entirely bad, but I hope that this is the low point in what should be a long and prosperous career for Kevin Smith.",Mallrats

135,Hannibal_Chigurh,An Under-Appreciated Effort,7,26 October 2007,"Following Kevin Smith's simplistic yet incredible debut, he got picked up by the indie patrons Bob and Harvey Weinstein. The powers that be threw money at Smith, who didn't even want it. He believed he could make Mallrats for at most 2 million. They gave him six. As a result, the film contains dialogue and events meant for a $500,000-$2 million picture and put $6 million worth of stuff in it. This makes a little too schlocky.To use the budget, Kevin writes a plot that involves too much movement. What could have been said one set is spread out to three. The film follows Quint and Brodie as they hang out in a mall after both being dumped by their girlfriends. Jason Lee rocks in his debut film performance as a snarky, wildly funny sidekick that usurps Jeremy London at every turn. Jay and Silent Bob still have the tiny role from Clerks even though it's a much bigger film. Chasing Amy also didn't give them a big role, but that film also didn't call for them as much. J&SB appear often here but don't have enough to do.Like all Kevin Smith films, the dialogue is incredible. Lee gives the lines his own flair, and is my favorite VA cast member. He even beats out Jeff Anderson's Randall in terms of acerbic wit. The schlocky elements, though a little annoying at times, are fairly well done and most of them get laughs.When this came out, the critics tore Kevin apart for the sophomore slump. In reality, he did the best possible job he could have considering all the studio pressure on him. Mallrats was a necessary flop that proved to the studio heads that Kevin was best left alone. That resulted in a string of great films from Chasing Amy to the most recent, Clerks II (yes, I even include Jersey Girl in that. It's a great film). This has been called the gateway film to the View Askewniverse, as this is the first Smith film many see. It is by no means a bad film, but it's probably Kevin's least accomplished effort.",Mallrats

I liked Clerks, but I thought the jokes in Mallrats, even the sex jokes, were more clever than the ones in Clerks. One example is the opening narration that serves as a prologue to the film in which Jason Lee's character asks why his cousin keeps buying kittens which keep getting ""stuck up his ass"", to which the cousin replies ""how else am I supposed to get the gerbil out?"" I also liked the style of the film more than Clerks. Yes, much of the film is static like Clerks, and even the Steadicam shots are very steady, but there's still a lot of cool things going on here with Kevin Smith's directing.Of course the review wouldn't be complete without mentioning the great, hilarious performances by Jeremy London, Jason Lee, a young Ben Affleck, Ethan Suplee, and of course Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith as Jay and Silent Bob, who I actually found to be at their most likable in Mallrats (I especially liked the bits detailing their plans to thwart the evil mall cop La Fours and how they execute them).The only criticism of the film I have is that the romantic element of the film gets a bit too cheesy for me at times, but the movie isn't supposed to be like Chasing Amy where romantic realism is put face first, it's supposed to be a fast paced comedy, so of course not as much effort went into the romance as the rest of the film. But this doesn't really depreciate the value of the movie, just sort of weighs it down.Regardless, I believe that if people can loosen their hold and focus on realism for an hour and a half that Mallrats is a very enjoyable film and definitely worth a watch.",Mallrats
139,jjpurwitsky,Mallrats directed by Kevin Smith,6,31 August 2012,"After his assured debut, Kevin Smith followed Clerks. with Mallrats, his sophomore film, in 1995. Backed by a studio, Smith gathered his team together and made what can only be stated as a disappointing second feature. Sure it features the great writing that was present in Clerks. but at the same time the movie itself falls flat on many levels.With Clerks., Smith was unleashed on the world as a major new talent. The realistic dialogue and inventive banter between the characters made for a hilarious and engaging film, even though the production felt very much like a 'film school' project. The problems with Clerks. were all about production value which was seriously over shadowed by the wonderful writing and amusing situations that the main characters found themselves falling into. Backed by a studio, Mallrats should have felt a lot more professional, but sadly is plagued by many of the problems that plagued Clerks. and a few other problems too. Like Clerks., Mallrats is a simple film about regular characters and takes place in few locations. This time, a mall, rather than a convenience and video store. Jeremy London and Jason Lee take the leads, and again, like Clerks. Jay and Silent Bob, played by Jason Mewes and Smith, respectively, appear again in this film.There are some laugh out loud funny moments in this film. There is more of a story than Clerks., but not much and there is a bigger cast of characters that Smith introduces. Ben Affleck appears, in an early role, as does Michael Rooker, Shannon Doherty and Priscilla Barnes. But it is really Jason Lee who steals the movie. His performance is the saving grace to Mallrats. Take out Jason Lee and you are left with a rather childish, immature film that tries to mimic Clerks. but never really succeeds. Jason Lee is so good in this film you relish every time he is on screen. His delivery of the witty lines written by Smith is fantastic and when he's not on screen you just wish he would return. Jeremy London on the other hand, is rather weak. His performance is straight out of a television movie of the week and pales in comparison to everyone else in the film.Jay and Silent Bob are pretty good too, although overshadowed by Lee's performance, but are put in ridiculous situations that sometimes just feel stupid. Which is where the main problem with Mallrats lies. The plot points are rather immature. Smith tries to repeat the magic of Clerks., but unlike that film, which was confined to small locations, Mallrats moves throughout the mall, and not very well I might add. Ridiculous plot points, like a TV game show, feel forced and cheesy. And Smith's direction of the action that takes place within the film is too minimalistic and comes off as weak.Clerks. felt static in its direction, no movement just plain still shots that were rather bland. Mallrats adds very little to this aesthetic. While in color, and looking a hell of a lot glossier than Clerks., the camera doesn't do much to capture what is happening on the screen. One scene in particular, involving Silent Bob and a toy truck, is so poorly done it feels almost embarrassing to watch. There is no cohesion to the scene, it just feels tacky and uninvolving. Smith's direction of this and many other scenes just feels boring. So boring! Smith seems to favour a point and shoot style of filmmaking which worked fairly well with Clerks. but fails miserably in Mallrats.But that's not to say this film is boring, for it surely isn't. Smith's direction is weak, and his writing, although delivering goldmine after goldmine of hilarity,is somewhat poor when it doesn't involve a joke. The soundtrack is pretty decent, in a mid-nineties kind of way and it's fun to hear these songs, some which I haven't heard in years.What really makes this movie is Jason Lee. He stands out and feels better than the movie he is in. He is a joy to watch and whenever he is missing from the screen the movie starts to lag. He alone makes Mallrats worth watching and raises this movie to heights it otherwise doesn't deserve. Smith is great at writing dialogue, and is pretty funny as Silent Bob, but in regards to writing plot and directing action, he comes off pretty weak here.Mallrats is a somewhat disappointing follow up to Clerks., but is worth watching for Jason Lee's breakthrough performance and some truly funny dialogue.Film Rating: 63%Breakdown (How Mallrats scored 63%):Production Design: 7 out of 10 Cinematography: 6 out of 10 Re-playability: 7 out of 10 Originality: 5 out of 10 Directing: 5 out of 10 Editing: 7 out of 10 Script: 5 out of 10 Acting: 7 out of 10 Sound: 6 out of 10 Music: 8 out of 10Read more of my reviews at www.fullmetalreviews.blogspot.com",Mallrats

Fifteen minutes inside the mind of Kevin Smith would be a trip worth being spat onto the New Jersey Turnpike.  I'd pay good money to gain a glimpse of the world as he sees it.  The writing in the movie is really, really top notch, and every scene is filmed with a minimalist eye for comedy.  I would say that this movie is EASILY the funniest movie the man has ever filmed.  Not the greatest: quite frankly, it's a little rough around the edges.  But you'll be hard-pressed to find a funnier movie on the video store shelves.Kevin Smith's movies have been maligned in the film community for many reasons.  Mallrats especially been the subject of two of the most common complaints about Smith's movies: uninspired direction and flat characters. However, these claims are often untrue, and sometimes unimportant.  There may not be amazing cinematography in Mallrats, no incredible steadicam work or breathtaking pans, but let's face it folks: the movie's set in a mall. For one thing, no-one wants to see sweeping panoramic views of a food court. For another thing, the movie isn't about original camera angles, it's about incredibly interesting and bizarre situations set in the most benign and uninteresting of all places.As for character complaints, while there are a great deal of characters in the film that could be easily characterized in one sentence, not only does the pace of the movie demand it but deep character development is unnecessary.  Many of the characters in the movie are examples of the kinds of people the audience members know from real life.  The geeky girl in high school is combined with the easy girl in high school: this is an equation that the audience members can figure out for themselves.  The local drug dealer, some mallrat kids, the love-lorn moron, the sarcastic sidekick (sorry, Brodie), and the bad-tempered store manager are all people that most of us have run into in our lives, and we can fill in the blanks from there.At the end of it all though, Mallrats is first and foremost about the situations.  This movie may seem a little uneven at times, because the best parts of the movie are individual sequences, not the characters or the over-arcing storyline.  I list such memorable moments as: the kid on the escalator.  Relationship advice from Stan ""The Man"" Lee.  A debate on the classification of the cookie stand.  Jay and Silent Bob beating up the Easter Bunny. Hartford beating Vancouver 12-2.  A deep discussion on the biology of Superman.  The entirety of Truth or Date.And, of course, anything Jason Lee says.  His portrayal of Brodie is an outstanding portrayal of the best character Kevin Smith has ever written. He's comfortable with both sarcasm and sentiment, and he has nearly all of the best lines in the movie.  All of his scenes are incredible, and he is completely at home in the asylum that is the local mall.  Jason Lee is the funniest thing about this movie, and while his acting is a little rough, so's the character, and so's the movie.  And who said you needed to be Richard Burton to deliver lines like ""Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned for Sega""?  Not I!To review: it's not cinematic art, but it's not supposed to be.  It's supposed to be strange, it's supposed to be outrageous, and it's supposed to be funny.  And it is INCREDIBLY funny.  Rent it and try not to laugh. Especially at the kid on the escalator.  That cracks me up every single time.Rating:  7/10.",Mallrats
144,jonnaharkenson,"A cult classic, fun comedy movie!",8,30 July 2021,"The fact that it features Stan Lee in the movie, that alone already makes it an instant cult classic (and it also has Ben Affleck who is a very notable celebrity and actor). I've only recently seen this movie in 2021 for the first time and the film brings back very nostalgic memories of the 1990's! Everything looks just like how I remembered it was in the 90's. I used to spend a lot of time at my local mall in high school, so I could relate to the characters always hanging out at the mall and finding escape.. though the only thing I didn't see was an arcade!Going back to the movie, I think it probably was much funnier at the time it was released, though I still think the movie is funny. The movie mentions comic books a lot and it features Stan Lee, so anyone who is a huge comic book or Marvel fan will enjoy this film. The storyline was pretty decent, I think it is a good ""buddy comedy"" movie and it's entertaining.I think the movie looks like it was meant for kids, since the cover is a comic book drawn cover.. but it's really a comedy movie for grown adults or many teenagers.. not young children. It is kind of crude humor, but I don't mind.. but I'm sure there are a lot of people who would be easily offended by it.. it is rated R so hopefully parents actually pay attention to that.This movie I could relate to a lot: growing up in the 90's as a comic book fan, spending all day at the mall not buying anything, hanging out with friends at the mall, and attending special events at the mall.I like this movie and the nostalgia just makes it so much better, and the fact of has Stan Lee just makes it a cult classic. I don't think it's perfect and think it could have been a little better, but it was very enjoyable and now I'm very interested in watching the spin-off movies now! And I can't wait until the Mallrats 2 movie finally comes out, which I hear features the late Stan Lee and all of the original cast!",Mallrats

Why didn't it do better in the box office?,10,20 June 2000,"POSSIBLE LIGHT SPOILERS It's rare nowerdays that you find a sensible teen comedy... & this is no exception to the rule. The basic story goes that two guys are dumped by their long term girlfriends and to console themselves, they head for their favourite place... the mall. Then, once they get there, they realise that (& bear with me on this) the father of one of their ex-girlfriends has set up his TV gameshow on a stage in the mall, and that the ex-girlfriend is going to be one of the contestants on the show (the show is a typical blind date, 3 guys contest for a holidays with the girl) & then he has to stop the show to get the girl. This is a stupid plot, but the silm is hilarious. Brodie played by Jason Lee has some brilliant lines, as does Jeremy London (the QB from dazed and confused), though to me the two best parts in this film were undoubtedly Jay & Silent Bob. They stole every scene they were in, and the blueprints for their actions were great. This is an awesome film. if you're looking for an easy on the mind, funny comedy, give this a go. (p.s. you also get to see Joey Lauren Adams topless so the film is pretty much worth it just for that)",Mallrats

Kevin Smith remains one of those successful people in the movie industry that eludes me as to how they even have a career. I'm so sick of the usual unlikely-dialog in these pathetic attempts to carve a specific niche in cinema. This movie is the same formula as all of his more popular movies... Two losers, waxing philosophic with witty and ponderous segues into comedic hi-jinx. Makes me want to vomit. I've often wondered why his movies are so popular. I think I have it. There must be millions of people like this in the U.S. Lazy good for nothings with the feeling that they are misunderstood geniuses.

Mallrats does this perfectly, while remaining hilarious all the while.  Critics dismissed this film as Kevin Smith 'selling out.'  Why is this?  Because it had a happy ending?  Since when were happy endings evidence of a bad film?  Mallrats is by far Smith's funniest film, even if it isn't considered his best.  Jason Lee gives an inspired performance, but Jeremy London does little more than avoid ruining the movie.",Mallrats

This film is fun. I'd even say that Clerks is way overrated by some - in that it ""cool"" to like, whilst undoubtedly being a good film, so is this. Don't let Claire Forlani swing your opinion but go watch this film in neutral light and without the general consensus that out of all his (now) four films, this is the worst, by far. Nicht so. I mean, it's got Jason Lee, its got to be said... he's a funny guy.And someone asked ""Why do we need Jay and Silent Bob in every film?"" because these are Kevin Smith movies... which planet has this person been living on?

The story in Mallrats is a little less inane, and the characters really are characters. Technically, it's a better movie... but as a result it sacrifices some of that gloriously inane humour that it could easily have had. Still, i gave it a 9. It made me laugh, cry, and hurl (i'll never shake hands with anyone ever again!) And that's about all you could ever ask for! Oh... thought i should just mention the dialogue! DAMN it was good.

If Jason Mewes is the best actor in a film you know you have real trouble. I can only assume this was a misguided attempt to make a John Hughes movie but a bit edgier for an older audience. Unfortunately no one can deliver even the good lines naturally and it fails to create an air of Askewniverse.

The budget for this movie was now $6,000,000 and had a much larger crew and professional actors. The film was released in October of 1995 and met with both critical and box office failure, only boxing 2,000,000. The movie, however found success on home video and has since become a cult classic.The film's main problem is that Kevin Smith, famous for making movies different from the mainstream comedies, tries to hard to make a normal comedy.

I LOVE them!  Clerks is a true masterpiece, but Mallrats isn't far behind.  It's amazing how clearly you can see Smith's growth as a person and a director even watching these movies out of order.

And for those who never could see the 'hidden pictures' (the ones you have to stare at in a weird way to see what the picture is), this will help you feel better.This movie is definitely worth seeing..

To be quite blunt, I prefer Mallrats to the over-rated American Pie. Mallrats follows the adventures of the recently-dumped T.S. Quint(Jeremy London) and his slacker buddy who has also been dumped, Brodie Bruce(Jason Lee). They decide to numb their pain by going to the local mall to chill. T.S. discovers that his former girlfriend is going to be auctioned off at her father's ""Dating Game"" ripoff show, which is going to be broadcasted live at the mall. T.S. and Brodie run into Jay and Silent Bob, and enlist them to destroy the gameshow. This is where the hilarity ensues. The movie isn't as good as Clerks, but it's a helluva good ride. Complete with Easter Bunny Bashing, topless fortune telling, Stan ""The Man"" Lee, comic book, Sega, and a very obscure reference to Clerks. NOTE!! Brian O' Halloran (Dante in Clerks) shows up in the movie as Gill Hicks, an obvious relative to Dante Hicks. And don't miss the hat that T.S. picks up in the Flea Market.",Mallrats

I'm not sure whether this is just really thick or maybe you had to be born at the dawn of the comic book era, or even just be a little sad...but the general public, like your average middle class suburbanite would hate this film coz it can be really gross at times.

165,BigJedi-2,A Classic ahead of it's time...,10,26 July 1999,"Once in a while a great movie comes a long, and is shunned at the box office, and kicks around on video until someone picks it up and gives it a shot, and the chain is linked, people get hooked...as what happened to ""Mallrats"".  Kevin Smith's second shot at directing, this time with a 6 million dollar budget (instead of just over $27,000 for 1994's ""Clerks"") is what Hollywood movies should be and a lot of times aren't.  People casted this film aside like bad fruit, even a lot of the people who worked on it, but now this film is loved by many because it is a great film!  Sure there is some Hollywood sellout in the air of the film, but it's done right. The humor is raunchy, but smart and funny.  Mallrats is one of those strange treasures you don't find everyday, and has found a place in my heart (along with a slew of other people's hearts) and is one of my favorite films. The thing about this film is the characters, Kevin Smith has a way of making his characters as someone you know or can relate to, unlike most movies that come out of Hollywood.  This film isn't just an exclusive to Smith fans though...for example, my mother hated ""Clerks"", and didn't seem to interested in ""Chasing Amy"", but whenever I'm watching ""Mallrats"" on video or DVD, she always sits down and laughs along with me.  Jeremy London (as T.S. Quint) is the only set back to the film, his dry acting is a downer, but Jason Lee (playing Brodie Bruce) picks up London's slack, and steals the show in the process.  As always Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith himself) are given great moments, that could make anyone cheer them on. Over all ""Mallrats"" deserves an ""A""",Mallrats

Both are set over one day and feature the exploits of two friends who have little hope for the future. However whilst 'Clerks' was a fairly realistic film, 'Mallrats' has much in common with 1980's teen films and sometimes comes across as a teen romantic/comedy. One scene even contains a bit of gross out humour which called to mind 'American Pie'.Despite this, 'Mallrats' is a great film that is really, really funny. Kevin Smith's flair for dialogue and characters shine here. Brodie has to be one of his greatest creations and keeps the film entertaining throughout. Even the typical cheesy romance parts keep the viewer engaged because of the humour used throughout. Ben Affleck also makes a great villain - partly because I hate his other movies so much. I still think that this is a film for people who know films by Kevin Smith. So 'Clerks' would be a good film to see before 'Mallrats'. But if your a fan there is very little that can go wrong in seeing this film. It always raises a smile whenever I think about it.",Mallrats

This is a fresh breath of air into the heavily made-up and glossy Hollywood productions. Also, in ""Mallrats"", we have made the pleasant acquaintance of actor Jason Lee, who is just about the perfect guy for this film. I also find it very relieving that Kevin Smith does not attempt to bore us with that ""oh let's educate the watchers""- morality so often to be found in American comedy films.All in all this is the perfect film to watch when you need some cheering-up, relief from work or just one and a half hour of total, none-educational fun.",Mallrats

But the charicter interaction is seemless and the set peaces work like a charm. also this our second chance to meet jay and silent bob played by jason mewes and kevin smith (who also directed) who have appeared in five movies now including their latest jay and silent bob strike back. if you have given this film a miss because of the bad reviews then all I can say is give it a go you wont regret it.",Mallrats

It was aimed at a young adult audience and was garnished with crude remarks, that made you laugh rather then cringe. The critics seemed to lap this effort up and gave the movie, which was shot in black and white, rave reviews. This treatment was not bestowed on Mallrats.The critics were not impressed by this follow up, they saw it as an immature spawn of Clerks. Kevin Smith, in his defence, promoted the film as a dedication to the movies he used to love when he was growing up, (no not Star Wars) These mainly concerned the films created by John Hughes e.g Breakfast club, Weird science. The critics though, maintained their opinions, which caused Smith to ""think again"" and follow up with his most mature creation, Chasing Amy.Personally I really enjoyed Mallrats. It was the first Kevin Smith film that I had the pleasure to watch. I thought the characters were superbly funny, especially Brodie (played, at the time, by a little known Jason Lee) who was entertaining whenever he graced the screen. The plot, as in most comedies, was not supposed to delve into your mind and make you think about it days later, it was supposed to make you laugh, and in my opinion it succeeded.The film also introduced me to two characters who are now becoming cult icons. I am of course referring to Jay and Silent Bob (the latter played by Smith himself) These guys, apart from Jason Lee, are the funniest characters on display, I love their ongoing antics.Maybe this wasn't the natural successor to Clerks but as a stand alone film it is excellent. Just watch it, and don't worry whether it's witty enough or mature enough, just watch it and laugh.",Mallrats
179,the_deviot,unfortunately Kevin's best work yet,10,16 June 2002,"I love anything kevin smith has touched, it might not turn to gold but it has its own personal worth, this was the first Kevin Smith film that i ever saw and enjoy watching it still, even though i can quote the movie when i'm not in the room. But unfortunately its his best work so far, i want to see something out due Mallrats, if its possible, if its not i will settle and let Mallrats be the greatest movie ever, but now Kevin has experience under his belt and hopefully there won't be anymore movies with just Jay and Bob, which i understand as being the greatest characters ever created, but how can you forget Brodie? Jason Lee is a great actor, Mallrats may not prove it but he is truly up there when it comes to comedy. Its a true shame we won't see anymore come out of the View Askew universe, but like Kevin said""it was nice while it lasted"" I just hope it never ends, this movie has characters you just fall in love with, even if all they do is just hang out at the mall.",Mallrats

181,danielmeakin,Very Very Funny.,8,27 January 2004,"Well, this film is great, it's one of the few decent american comedy films of the 90s,Jason Lee i feel puts in a great performance. Everytime i see the film it still cracks me up, even after a few years have passed (nearly a decade....does time go that fast!!!) There's no real ""serious"" acting, but comedy films are rarely powerfully acted dramas! i rate this an 8.Comments are welcome to me via my email. PS-entitle the subject MALLRATS (so i know it aint spam!)",Mallrats
182,shnizzedy,Jedi Mind Trick,4,11 November 2008,"Obviously an early view into the View Askew world, Mallrats suffers some from inexperienced writing and direction from Kevin Smith himself. There are enough funny and original jokes to make the film worth watching (as well as several Looney Tunes, comic book, and video game references), but 13 years after its release, many of the jokes have been duplicated, reduplicated, and played out.The dialog is unrealistic, which makes the movie straddle the line between classy and campy, sometimes charmingly, sometimes irritatingly. In fact, this movie will probably make anyone laugh at least once, be charmed at least once, and be irritated at least once. I dare you not to.",Mallrats
183,eddie736,"Not as good as Clerks, Chasing Amy",7,19 November 1998,"I agree that of the three Kevin Smith films, this one is probably the worst. Of course, any Kevin Smith movie is better than most mainstream films. However, I have heard that even Kevin didn't like this one very much. He wanted to make a coming-of-age movie, he said, and it ended up being a Fast Times at Ridgemont High knock-off.Still, it's a fun movie with some hilarious moments. Snoochie-noochie, bickety-bam!!It's too bad his Superman film got shelved. But, I, like the rest of you, am anxiously looking forward to Dogma!!",Mallrats
184,John Warner,Brilliant,10,31 March 1999,"Following on from Clerks, Kevin Smith's sequel was initially reviled, and at one point Smith apologised for it. But reading present interviews he defends Mallrats, and so he should because it is a fine film, full of witty one liners and hilarious slapstick comedy. Compared to Chasing Amy and Clerks, it's not as mature, but is my personal favourite of the trilogy.",Mallrats

""Mallrats"" is just not funny. I don't think I laughed once during this film. Maybe after watching ""Clerk's"" I was expecting way to much. I don't know I just dont think it's up to the standard of Smith's other films ""Clerk's"" and ""Chasing Amy"". The only reason to watch this film is to catch the very talented Jason Lee he is definitely somebody to keep you eye out for.",Mallrats

Jason Lee's performance in this made me go out and watch all of his other movies. This is one of the few movies that I have seen over 5 times. (others include The Terminator and T2, and The Pest) If you haven't seen this movie, see it.",Mallrats
187,Jonny Russell,"Underrated, Comedy Classic.",10,29 December 1999,"For whatever reason this, the second of the Jersey trilogy is looked on as the worst of the three. The only reason I can think of is Jeremy London who manages to ruin any slightly funny line T.S is given, Luckily Jason Lee is there to save the film as Brodie one of if not the funniest character in all of Smith's movies. Forget what any of the critics say and don't take Kevin Smith's tongue-in-cheek apology to heart, this is one of the funniest films in years and is in my opinion, much better than the overrated 'Clerks'.",Mallrats
188,imortalkandy,A great addition to any home collection,10,26 January 2001,"Kevin Smith does it again, with this delightful story of two young men who have both been dumped and seek resurrection of their relationships via the local mall.  The concept may seem corny, but when combined with ironic, and witty comedy, and a great cast this serves as a great film.  This unique tale also has a good replay value, as the jokes, and characters all blend with his other films, Clerks, Chasing Amy, and slightly in Dogma.  I must have seen this about 40 times and I still won't groan if somebody sticks it in. Smith's films serve as a great idea for a movie night. I highly recommend all of them, however this is my personal favourite.",Mallrats
189,capt_cool,very funny,9,13 June 2006,"See I loved this movie from beginning to end, BUT after saying that I must also note that this was the very first Kevin Smith movie I saw and is my favorite. Too start things off I'd like to say this movie's plot well isn't that original it focus's on: these dudes have girl friend,and dudes lose girl friends, dudes try to get girls back. But for any one reading this that hasn't seen a Kevin Smith movie you, you don't really go to Kevin Smith movies for plot. You go because of characters and dialog. For example: Jay and Silent Bob, two stoner's that aren't even major characters in the film but just from there parts in the movie you learn to love these characters. Brodie, one of the 2 main characters, just the way he's presented and the witty dialog. It's just you cant not like these characters and what the characters talk about or to each other.This was Kevin Smith's 2nd film (Clerks was his first). The sad thing about Mallrats was that it did not do good at box office and did not get the best reviews way back in '95, but now it is considered to be a movie before it's time. Because it has received such a cult following and got way more attention then it ever did when it hit VHS and DVD. So go see this movie. If you like it check out more Kevin Smith movies like Clerks, Dogma, Chasing Amy, and Jay and Silent Bob Strikes Back. These are all such great films........... oh I almost forgot about Jersey Girl........ well no ones perfect. SRS",Mallrats
190,movielover123,My Favorite Kevin Smith Film Thus Far.,9,26 November 2001,"Although some of the humor is extremely crude, this 1995 Kevin Smith effort had me doubled over in laughter for nearly the entire film's length. Jason Lee (""Chasing Amy"" and ""Almost Famous"") is superb in the lead role as the quintessential 90's slacker and the rest of the cast, made up of a lot of Kevin Smith regulars and Shannon Doherty, shine in their roles as well. As with all Kevin Smith films, the emphasis is on the dialogue and relationships the characters have, but ""Mallrats"" has a bit more action and is slightly more plot driven than, say, ""Clerks"". All in all, highly funny and enjoyable and I rated it a ""9"".",Mallrats
191,bifjenks,Great Film,9,10 September 2002,"Ok lets look at this film from both angles.  Coming after the amazing Clerks this second film in the series was always going to suffer from comparisons. I can see how film critics might see this as a poorer neighbour of his other films for a start it's shamless in its off the wall style humour it tends to read like a comic book rather than his previous and post masterpieces. Lets face it the acting sucks!! The more acomplished actors in the film shone through despite having to deliver some of Smiths more complex set piece comedy routines Jason Lee & Claire Forlani handled there parts to perfection Shannon Doherty tagged along for the extra publicity for the film (please see box covers) ,But some of the others always seemed out of their depth with Jeremy London at the top of the list.  Kevins Smiths insistence in providing friends with bit parts hinders his films as scenes like the comic book store when Brodie finds out Stan Lee is signing spoil the film due to atrocious acting by extras.  Now we have the negatives out the way let me say that out of all the Smith films it has a special place in my collection ok it's no Clerks but it's funny, the dialouge and comic timing of Lee give the film a great edge and the enclosed setting of the mall and limited number of characters makes for good development of the main 6 or 7 actors. All in all Mallrats is flawed but only in it's deliverance. The script is excellent and it could have been so much better had it come out maybe 3 or 4 years later when the budgets were bigger.  I think Mallrats is the film Jay & Bob strike back should have been!!",Mallrats
192,madamedemento,"Dialouge, Dialouge, Dialouge",10,14 July 2003,"This movie has the best dialouge of any movie I've ever seen. It's a simple portrayal of 2 guys, both having been dumped by their respective girlfreinds, who decide to spend a day at the local mall. While one (Jeremy London) is trying to win his girl back, the other (Jason Lee) is pretending like he is okay about his breakup. The storyline is good, but what makes this movie is the dialouge. Brodie is a smartass and feeds likes like ""Most of the time I'm just talking through my ass. Or sticking my hand in it."", while T.S. is a romantic loser who says things like "" You should see yourself right now - a grown man with his hand down his pants."" And with a great cast (Stan Lee, Ben Affleck, Joey Lauren Adams) this makes the movie so much more awesome than it already is. It really is a treat to see this.",Mallrats
193,ixxxi80,4 out of 10,4,25 January 2004,"This movie is very poorly scripted, acted, and directed. I think ""Clerks"" is allright, but this film is laughable. Yes, some of the dialogue is witty and some of the acting can be charming, but in the end it all doesn't add up. The comedy itself is aimed at a very young audience, or perhaps an older audience that has low expectations for comedy itself. I know the angle Kevin Smith is trying to ""go for"" and he does NOT succeed. When you consider how novel the idea and execution of ""Clerks"" was, ""Mallrats"" is a big disappointment. 4 out of 10.",Mallrats
194,V8_Jamez,Mallrats is the sewer of Smith films,5,19 September 2003,"I have seen and love all of Smith's flicks. This is by far the worse. If it weren't for Jason Lee (just a little bit less than the performance in Chasing Amy) this movie would be complete rat droppings. The dialogue is good, but not delivered with the pizazz of other Smith films. I think Smith films rank like this: 1. Dogma (1999) 2. Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001)3. Chasing Amy (1997) 4. Clerks. (1994) 5. Mallrats (1995) 
I think it safe to say that Kevin Smith, unlike a lot of movie makers, is getting better with time and experience. Big budgets help too. Let's see how Fletch turns out.",Mallrats
195,ian-smith,Great Movie,8,22 September 2006,"Mallrats was panned by critics. But to be honest, who makes movies strictly for the critics? If that was the case, you would lose the heart and soul of the film itself. I think Kevin Smith's direction and dialog are right on par with the witticism seen in Clerks I & II and especially in Chasing Amy. Smith's dialog is definitely a highlight, and the casting is great with the exception of Jeremy London. It's no wonder while most of the actors/actresses who have previously performed in Smith's movies have returned as their own characters or as others while London has been left out. His delivery is mediocre at it's best and plain embarrassing in others. But London's poor performance aside, Jason Lee is absolutely perfect as Brodie and his delivery and comic styling really are the carrying point of this film. The plot may be a little clichéd, however, the events that unfold throughout the movie make it different and one of a kind. Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith) provide excellent comic slap stick style which compliments the witty and humorous dialog perfectly. Overall, a great movie, and one that should be seen despite critical reaction. If you replace Jeremy London with a better role player who could pull off some of the dialog with some believability, then this movie would be ranked higher. Overall, I definitely recommend this film to Smith fans, and to those who want to laugh...and laugh a lot!",Mallrats
196,incomprehendible,Wow is the only thing to say here.,10,28 March 2006,"this is an incredible movie and if your a clerks fan (which I'm assuming is the only Kevin smith film you've seen because its blasphemous to watch them out of order) then this is even better. mallrats is the kind of movie you watch once on DVD and don't take it out of the drawer, because you know you'll wanna watch it later. its laugh out loud funny and anyone remotely interested in the inner workings of a geek or, like me, you are a geek, then this will give voice to the geek generation and make it cool. Recently, The OC has made comic books cool in the form of Seth Cohen. but before there was Seth, there was Brodie.easily the greatest character lee has ever played and the best character that Smith has ever written, Brodie is obsessed with two things, Comics and himself. and as long as the two are together, he doesn't care. which is exactly what must be changed. ill let you find out how.jay and silent bob make a welcome comeback in a slightly more central role with a lot more to do. with hilarious results.i originally put 8 for this movie. but thinking about it again its a 10 and its going in my movies :) l8er days PaUl :)",Mallrats

It's really funny, it has a great slightly cheesy plot, and most of all it has great characters. Jason Lee as Broody the smarmy comic book loving guy with a lovable asshole quality was great. I love the pointless arguments he gets into about the cookie stand in the mall and the kid on the escalator. I also love Jay and Silent Bob they are a dynamic duo of in this movie. I've never been to a flee market as crazy as the one in this movie, but I hope to someday! The Brenda part was classic, and I could relate to the whole magic eye thing. I've tried many a time to see that 3-D picture with out avail. I think this is a great movie and I'm glad I stumbled upon it. It made me laugh it made me cry (jk) ha ha. It was an entertaining film!",Mallrats
198,bennymcd,Funny but...,7,10 July 1999,"I'll have to admit I thought this movie was hilarious, but that's as far as I'm willing to take it.  It really is not a GREAT movie.  You can only watch a movie like this so many times.  The humor is meant for those who can't and won't think too hard about the jokes to get them.  Or for those who are just intelligent enough to understand them.  Maybe I was too old (mature) to see this movie when I did, but that is my philosophy.  One liners get stale and can't make a movie.  Mallrats has high entertainment value but nothing worth watching repeatedly in other words it is not a good movie, just good for a few laughs.I hate to utter the phrase... but this movie is a sell out.  It has no independent film spark.  I think the only reason Kevin Smith made this movie was to get enough money to work on greater projects like Chasing Amy and Dogma.  Clerks would have been a much more highly acclaimed film with a little more cash, although it is still one of my favorites.",Mallrats
199,geckodude,Jay and Silent Bob as cool as they'll ever be!!!,8,4 January 2000,"I get the impression that most people who comment about Kevin Smith's movies have never actually seen Mallrats and know it simply as his 'bad one'. They're missing out. Both Mallrats and the equally criticised Dogma are his best movies and are consistently funny and enjoyable. Clerks and Chasing Amy seemed to get a bit too weighed down at times but Mallrats is just so cool and so much fun to watch it's impossible not to like. Just because it is not another Clerks it gets criticised - critics would obviously be happier if Kevin Smith continually made films identical to that and then they'd get bored and criticise him for lack of originality. Ignore all the bad stuff you've heard about this movie, check it out and enjoy. Don't waste the opportunity to see something worth watching for once!!",Mallrats
200,jthecamb,My favorite of the Jersey Trilogy...,10,1 April 2002,"Mallrats is the biggest failure of Kevin Smith to date, but I think it is quite possibly the funniest of all of his films.T.S. Quint (Jeremy London) and Brodie Bruce (Jason Lee) are broken up with by their girlfriends.  They go to the mall to hang out and eventually decide to try to get back with their respective girlfriends.The story may be a little simple, but who cares?  The dialogue is hilarious and Jason Lee's Brodie is the funniest character in a Smith film.Good performances by Shannon Doherty, Ethan Suplee, Ben Affleck, and Jason Mewes round out the great cast.  Only Jeremy London and Claire Forlanie (but she's hot) giving less than stellar performances.Jason Lee, in what is basically his debut, carries the flick and could be on the verge of a very promising career in comedy.  Mallrats works when he is on the screen, and luckily, that is most of the time.",Mallrats
201,NathanA,lets go hang out at the mall,10,1 March 2001,"What is so fun of hanging out at the mall? Well if you know people like the characters of mallrats it would be a blast. The film is about Brodie and T.S. who both get dumped by their girlfriends Rene and Brandi, but instead of suffering they decide to go to the mall. Then thats when everything starts having run ins with Jay and Silent Bob the local drug dealing mischief makers, Willam who cant see the hidden 3-D picture, Lafours the mall security guard, Trishia Jones a.k.a.

""Chasing Amy"" also received similar critical fanfare, but sandwiched in between these two films was this comic gem, that went unappreciated until it found it's niche in the market after it came out on video. For those of you unfamiliar with the story, it is about two pals, Brodie and T.S. who have both just been dumped by their girlfriends. What are they going to do about it? Go to the mall! Hilarity ensues! Doesn't sound too funny? Perhaps you've forgotten the witty dialogue that Kevin Smith's characters banter back and forth. Perhaps you've yet to discover the brilliant Jason Lee and his fluid comic timing. In any case, if you are a fan of comedies with intelligent jokes mixed in with the fart jokes, or just a fan of movies, in general, and you haven't seen ""Mallrats""...you need to see it.

205,Lars-mustaine,What went wrong???,4,9 October 2002,"After seeing the truly excellent 'Clerks', director Kevin smith's first feature, I had high expectations of 'Mallrats' and have to say that I was dissapointed.True its not the worst film ever but its not a tuch on 'Clerks'. Here's why:The characters: Brodie (Jason Lee) is a good character, the 'Randal' of 'Mallrats if you like but I found T.C highly annoying and irritating. T.c is meant to be the' straight guy' to Brodie's wise-ass but he just angers me. All he does is whine (Thats all Dante did but...)The script: 'Clerks' had a brilliant script, the dialouge was well observed and real without being meaningless. 'Mallrats' script isnt bad but its not as clever or as well realised as clerks.Jay and Silent Bob: IMHO, these two characters cant carry a film on their own (JASBSB is a prime example of this). In mallrats they're normally supporting roles are made to be more main, more involved in the story. IMO they are weak characters and Mewes' acting is extemely poor.While this film isnt terrible, it is the 2nd worst film in the new jersey trilogy. JASBSB is the worst.",Mallrats

208,LoveDelicatessen,This had the potential to be Smith's finest.,10,31 July 2003,"Mallrats, the story of two friends who coincidentally both lose their girlfriends retreat to their local mall to work out their love lives and get back together with their girlfriends.  This had the potential to be Kevin Smith's best work in my opinion, but many factors held him back.  First of all the main goal of Universal was for this film was to be a hard R film with a teen audience in mind.  They were calling it a ""Smart Porkys"", because it had that snappy humor, but it had tits in it to attract teenage males.  Director/Writer Kevin Smith and Producer Scott Mosier wanted to make a studio film in hopes of making lots of money to fund more independent films.  Neither goal was really met, this film tanked at the box-office. It grossed only 3 million in total; meaning this film lost money with a total cost of 6 million.  This film had high hopes, all tests were good, but why was it such a dud?  Well I blame it on several factors, First of all Jim Jacks; the executive producer ruined this film.  Kevin Smith may not be the greatest director, but he is a great writer, the two set each other off making Kevin a solid filmmaker, but Jim Jacks was always holding him back by forcing Kevin to cut down on the vulgar dialog as well as graphic scenes. One scene was known as the ""cum in the hair"" joke that was later made famous in 'There's Something About Mary', but many people at universal including Jim Jacks were holding Kevin back from making the movie he wanted.  If you know Kevin's work, you will notice this is his only film where the word ""cock"" is never used.  It's just tossed around in ""Clerks' and common in his 3 other films.  It's that raw, real humor and language that many fans like about his writing.  Jim Jacks stressed that ""Potty Mouth"" (yes those were his words) be cut down.  Even though there is nudity, and they want that R rating, they still had to cut back on the f***s and other rude language, but that's not what really held this film back.  Gramercy Pictures, who were in charge of promoting this film, really did a poor job on making this movie known.  They used the tag line ""Starring Shannon Doherty and Jason Lee, someone you hate, and someone you've never even heard of."" That really doesn't help promote the film in anyway.  Then they asked Kevin and Scott to think of a good poster, now Kevin and Scott didn't think of ""hey what would make people want to check out our movie?"" they wanted ""what would look cool on my wall?""  The comic book cover poster is cool, but doesn't say much for the film, and it was the only poster made for the film. Some idiots were thrown off by it. Oh well. Also, the casting for this film was just okay, I was happy with Jason Lee as Brodie,  perfect job on that, but Jeremy London as T.S.?  Jeremy London is not that good of an actor, and just doesn't seem right for the part.  Then Claire Forlani as Brandy was okay, but I could hear that British accent coming out at times.  And then Shannon Doherty as Rene, first of all she really didn't seem thrilled to be in this movie, she never hung around the set, she would take off when she was done working.  Plus lots of people (the public) didn't like her at the time; she had a reputation as a wild one.  I think Kevin should have gone with his instinct and used Joey Lauren Adams.  I think she would have been perfect for that part.  They just barely got Jason Mewes to play Jay.  Universal didn't want jay to play jay, they wanted Seth Green or Breckin Meyer, but even they realized that Jay should be Jay, Jay is based on the way Jason Mewes really is.  I do think that Affleck was good as an asshole, but he probably could have played T.S. better than London.  Renee Humphrey as Trish was good, they almost cast Jennifer Love Hewitt instead, but she seems too cute and innocent to play that part.  Kevin Smith claims he could have made this film (probably better) with less money.  I mean look at how good 'Chasing Amy' is with a quarter million dollar budget.  Smith said that six million was just too much.  He hates losing money for people, if this movie was done with just a million dollars, it would have been just as good.  I agree.  Also, (now this is where I get a bit picky) the original opening of this film was cut, and for good reason, it sucked, it was not funny at all, nor was it even somewhat realistic.  If you watch closely, some dialog in this film is dubbed over and doesn't match the actor's mouth. This is because almost all references to that cut opening had to be cut, but it was too late to reshoot and in some instances, not possible to cut out of a scene.  This film was not a total disaster.  I believe it did pay for itself and probably profit when you include video rental where it was more popular than in theaters. Now when you take all of this into consideration, you see how great this film could have been.  Despite all of its flaws, Mallrats is still one of my favorite films, and definitely my favorite comedy.  I suggest you check it out if you liked Kevin's other work or even if you haven't, this one is probably the one that is most unlike his others.  I still give it a 10/10, but it could have been an 11.P.S. Check out the commentary on the DVD if you know about Kevin Smith and View Askew well, it's very funny to an askewniverse fan.",Mallrats

And I guess because I wanted to see how this silly movie ended.Crude language and concept aside- yes there's a spoiler coming up-Jason Lee's character wins his girlfriend, Shannen Doherty back by outing a statutory rape video in which Ben Affleck's character appears- all of the characters are incredibly unsympathetic. They never learn or change. Sure, it's a comedy, so there ought to be a necessary level of one-dimensionalism at play, but how these two men got girlfriends in the first place is beyond me.

211,TheBoss19872006,Not That Bad,7,20 June 2005,"This movie has always gotten a bad rap. On the contrary this movie is still enjoyable. Sure, it is the weakest of the New Jersey Trilogy (Clerks, Mallrats, and Chasing Amy) and essentially Clerks with a budget (Two slackers, one more motivated than the other). What really makes this film standout is the dialogue. It's smart, funny and easy to relate to. It's filled with lines commenting on the ""Mall Culture"", that make you think ""I've always wondered if anyone else thought that."" or ""Wow, that makes perfect sense!"" Also, while Jason Lee's role in Chasing Amy was his breakout role, this sets him up nicely for the role of Banky. He's not as crude or outrageous in this role but it can easily be seen as a warm-up. Overall this is a very enjoyable flick. It's not as good as Clerks and definitely not as good as Chasing Amy but is still worth renting and if you are a Kevin Smith fan you should own it.",Mallrats
212,Paperguy007,Saaaay...would you like a chocolate covered Pretzel?,10,21 September 2005,"This movie is incredible. many people would disagree for many reasons. People say that it is a bad movie with uneducated jokes. I would like to see them make a movie that is A) funnier B) More realistic Dialogue C) Better Directing. I see nothing wrong with this movie. It has a similar wit to that of ""Clerks"". This movie was over-bashed. The Critics Hated it Just look at what the average voter said about it. I love so many things about this movie including the great acting and screenplay. If you think this movie is bad than you didn't like ""Clerks"" or ""Chasing Amy"". Or instead of having your own opinion the one of the critics' was better so bash it. I think the reason the critics didn't like the movie is because they think Kevin Smith got such an easy start so it was time to bash him. If it was a bad movie, don't you think that there would be so few Kevin Smith fans out there? Maybe you think I'm not a movie person. Everyone Loved ""The Aviator"" It sucked. ""Titanic"" Sucked. ""Million Dollar Baby"" Terrible. That's Hollywood. Anyway in conclusion, one of my favorite comedies.",Mallrats
213,patrick-chaplain123,Brilliant and Nonsensical Hilarity!,9,16 February 2016,"A fantastic, albeit reasonably dated, 90s comedy typical of one of the funniest directors on the planet - Kevin Smith. The laughs are common and consistent and not a single cast member failed to make me laugh at some point. Particular standout cast members were director and writer Kevin Smith as well as Jason Mewes, reprising their roles as Jay and Silent Bob as featured in other Kevin Smith comedies including clerks. The script is fantastic and it is well deserving of it's high 9 / 10 rating from me as it just provided a good time - which is what a movie should do as not every film needs to provide multiple levels. This is a perfect example of an extremely funny film that never takes itself too seriously.",Mallrats
214,krityx,Can it actually get worse ?,3,18 July 2008,"Why does this movie have 7.1 ? It barely deserves a 3. The plot is a joke... even a 5 year old could come up with something better and more complex than this. But anyway I think this kind of movie isn't supposed to have that much of a plot. It would be fine I guess if the humor (which is what this movie relies on) was good. But it failed completely. There are like 2 or 3 funny lines throughout the movie but that's it. The acting is OK, the dialogue is realistic but that doesn't help this film so much. This bored me to death, it was almost as bad as Bubba Ho-Tep, another terrible ""movie"" if it can be called that. Avoid seeing this unless you want some brainless not funny at all comedy.",Mallrats

217,cozmic33,"""You dumb b****rd..""",9,15 August 1999,"This movie kicked ass.. I laughed from the start to the finish , and must have watched it over 40 times and it still has its effect. I loved Clerks which had me eagerly awaiting the 2nd movie in the trilogy and I wasn't disapointed. I was however bored into a coma with part three 'Chasing Amy'...I was expecting more of the sharp wit and  slapstick humour of the first two movies but it had an entirely different flavour. Anyways... I fully recommend this movie which brings back Jay and Silent Bob who have bigger roles and are sure to keep you rolling in the aisles. Jason Lee is a class act as Brodie and even Shannon Dougherty is good value... My favourite lines from Mallrats are.. William to a little girl.."" Hahaha, You dumb ba****d..its a sailing boat not a schooner.."" Jay to Silent Bob..""Fly! Bad ass...Fly!"" & ""...Tubby Bitch..."" I rated it 9/10 for entertainment value",Mallrats
218,Josh153,The lost Gem of View Askew,10,6 July 2000,"It's no secret that Kevin Smith is my hero. Every time I've ever heard an interview with him he always downs the film, which is one of my favorites. Sure, it may have flopped at the theater, but when was the last time (except for maybe Gladiator) that a movie that was really good was publicly and critically lauded. The dialogue is first rate, the jokes are hilarious, and the cast, though they are a varied bunch does a great job. Jason Lee delivers the best performance of the film in his first feature role (if you don't want to count Blind's Video Days, where his awesome skating will be immortalized). This movie is a riot, and a worthy addition to Kevin Smith's body of work. If you haven't seen it, get your best people on acquiring you a copy.",Mallrats

I guess I just understand Kevin Smith movies more than others, and I would like a chance to explain how brilliant the movie really is.  First of all, you have to understand that the movie is a ""pothead"" movie.  But that is just one aspect.  Also, the style of the movie and the direction that some find ""awkward"" is supposed to be in the tradition of the John Hughes movies to which there are numerous references.  Finally, you have to understand Kevin Smith's fascination with comic books.  A lot of people think that s**** is for kids, but there is a lot of intelligence in them.  Kevin Smith purposely made a big portion of this movie like a comic book.  That is why it may seem cartoonish at times.  But that's the f-ing point.  It's not a flaw.  If anyone watches the movie, they have to at least appreciate that it is funny. But for those who are intelligent enough to look for the more sublime hilarities that populate this movie, it's downright funny as hell.  Watch again, hopefully you'll get it.",Mallrats

There's not a day goes by, not a day, that i don't find myself quoting this utterly unbelievable comedy.  I don't think I have ever seen a more developed, dynamic, magnanimous, well-rounded, enjoyable character as Brodie Bruce that Jason Lee brought to life. His ravings and rantings flow well throughout the entire movie, supported well by the performance given by ex-90210 star, Shannon Dougherty, as his (ex)girlfriend Rene, the backseat acting of Jeremy London as his sidekick T.S., and the ever great duo Jay and Silent Bob. Kevin Smith has created this entire world that is sure to delight anyone.  His writing is the same witty dialogue as found in his previous endeavor ""Clerks"" but with much better filming and acting.

224,damienfox,A must-see for Kevin Smith fans,8,21 January 2002,"In many ways, Mallrats is one of Kevin Smith's better films. I actually preferred it to Clerks. I felt it was much funnier and had a better storyline.The film concentrates on Brodie (Jason Lee) and his best friend T.S. (Jeremy London) and their efforts to win back their girlfriends who dump them both at the start of the film. Brodie is dumped by his girlfriend (Shannon Docherty) because she believes he has no future goals. T.S. is shown the door by his girlfriend due to pressure from her father and an fatal incident involving a local girl! The film mainly takes place around the local Mall (Brodie and T.S. hang around the Mall all day, hence the term ""Mallrats""). Brodie and T.S. get the Kevin Smith regulars Jay and Silent Bob to help them in their endeavors.Jason Lee is absolutely hilarious in the film, especially during the main scene towards the end of the film. Equally as impressive is Michael Rooker as Claire Forlani's lunatic father, who detests T.S. as he believes he is a no hoper.There is a multitude of sex, comic book and Star Wars jokes to keep Kevin Smith fans happy. There is even a special cameo appearance by Stan Lee! Most of the jokes work very well and this is definitely a film to be rewatched. However, people who are easily offended are probably best to keep away from this film (and the rest of Kevin Smiths films, coming to think about it!)This film is most like Kevin Smith's most recent offering, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back - so if you like this film I urge you to see Mallrats.Rating: 8 out of 10",Mallrats

I should know I refused to see it when it was release because of my hatred of Shannon D.. Well was I mistaken, as she had little to no impact in the movie other then budget-wise. I really believe Kevin was true to his first movie ""Clerks"" with this release. I really love all the inside jokes and the references to Clerks.",Mallrats

It was a a lot better then Porky's that Mallrat's was compared to or that second one what was it called Porky's 2!? Come on those movies sucked though those actors, are has beens now!

227,malkumkabuki,organised chaos,7,16 June 2003,"Kevin Smith's follow-up to Clerks sees similar themes present, such as the backdrop of commerce and popular culture to the emotional problems of nineties teenagers in the foreground, as well as the constant struggle between he who takes drastic measures and he who takes realistic measures in order to solve problems. Mallrats is a far less arthouse movie compared to clerks, however, and far more intent on being a rollercoaster of slapstick comedy that eventually winds up all the variant plot strands into one thrilling end, than making the viewer think about the world. Mallrats is lighthearted in spirit, and if taken in the same spirit as it is intended than there is no reason why it should not be considered one of Smith's major achievements. And Jay and Silent Bob, who are possibly the best comic invention of a decade absolutely glow in this film, especially in the trip to the 'dirt mall'",Mallrats

231,michael-obrien1,"Infinitely hilarious, one of SMith's best works",10,8 July 2005,"Kevins Smith is known for his pop-culture based absurdist dialogue that keeps his fans laughing until the end. He doesn't let up here. Although this is one of his least offensive films, it still has people wondering if the Thing's Wang is made of rock, or if Lois Lane can in fact have Superman's child...then thinking, ""Gross!"". The film is a lot easier to watch with your parents than something like Chasing Amy or Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.The film opens with both Brodie(Jason Lee) and T.S. Quint(Jeremy London) being dumped by their girlfriends. They find solace in the one place where they know they're safe. The mall. ""Ah, I love the smell of commerce in the morning!"" Brodie yells as he enters the mall. These two are known as Mallrats, keying the name of the film. People who don't work or shop at the mall, just hang out. From there we meet many well developed characters such as William(Ethan Supplee) who undoubtedly works harder than any man alive to see a magic eye picture, Shannon(Ben Affleck) a Fashionable Male salesman who loves nothing more than making love in the most uncomfortable place, and I don't mean the back of a Volkswagon, and Brodie's and T.S.'s significant others. Oh yes, and of course, Jay and Silent Bob.The two, with the help of Jay and Silent Bob hatch many schemes to win they're girlfriend's back. With a dating show put on by T.S.'s girlfriend's father, who hates T.S.(okay now breathe, i know thats a lot to take in.) in the middle of the mall, where his girlfriend now is the one being auctioned off, he tries anything to win her back.The film is hilarious, including a topless fortune teller, Stan Lee(the God of comics), and even Brian O'Halloran playing a suitor for the dating show.

I laughed all the way through. The plot was simple enough. Our two down on the luck male stars have been rejected by their girlfriends and attempt to get them back. It sounds so unoriginal yet this is one of the main reasons the film works.  The simple plot allows the wealth of colourful characters, wacky gags and off the wall dialect to adding to, instead of interfering with the story.  The plot for the most part of the film sits squarely in the background crossing the path of our hapless duo every so often.  It's only in the last twenty minutes that they take action in a brilliant climax. Kevin Smith is a genius in my limited opinion for creating such a original cast of characters. I love this film almost too much. Watch it, you'll either: a) have to own a copy, or b) hate every second that goes by, it's one of those films.  A special mention to Jay and Silent Bob as they steal the show with their comic antics. I can't wait to see Dogma.",Mallrats

236,BigDaddy-21,Greatest Movie Of All Time,10,2 May 1999,"Mallrats is the funniest movie that I have ever seen. Kevin Smith did an awsome job with the cast and the script.

237,otopico,An fine example of saving a film,10,25 September 2001,"Mallrats is easily my favorite film. Not only as a wonderful piece of Kevin Smith and Company's ability to tell a story, but also an example of how to save a film from late production editing. I think this film should be required viewing for anyone thinking about entering the film industry.Anyone that has seen the 'collectors' edition of the DVD should watch the cut and re-edited scenes. From the original 'not funny' opening to the quick cover-ups (guy getting hit in the parking lot) the sheer amount of fixing that was needed before release could have easily doomed this film. I'm surprised that after 6 years, and 3 other New Jersey Trilogy films, I keep returning to Mallrats as my personal favorite.The 'fixed' story is simple enough to follow, but odd enough to have fun with. The guy versus the father of his girl, the side-kick, and of course the myriad of inhabitants of Kevin Smith's universe weave a wonderful but believable world where the audience can relax and just enjoy the simple messages of the tale.When released, Mallrats didn't meet some fans' expectations, and for that, it tends to be criticised or, even worse ignored. But to not see this film, even with it's flaws, is to deny oneself of a great opportunity to enjoy a film that is pure, unpretentious fun.Besides, it has Stan Lee in it. That alone makes this a gem of the film industry, even if the majority of critics don't think so.",Mallrats

I love Mallrats because it does the one thing that any comedy should do -- it makes me laugh, and often.  Kevin Smith is a gifted comedic screenwriter, and his talents are on full display here.  He displays a thorough understanding of the characters he writes, and the audience, or at least his target audience, can recognize them as people we know.  Of course the film is written with cartoonish exaggeration, but many great comedies are.  If Smith goes overboard at times in Mallrats (which he has acknowledged he did), it is a forgivable sin.  The criticism of the major players, however, is fully justified.  With the exception of Jason Lee, whom I find one of the most consistently funny actors in Hollywood today, the principals give completely wooden performances.  Nor are they aided by Smith's direction, which seems to have consisted of point and shoot.  Nevertheless, some of the smaller parts are well played, including those of Ben Affleck and Joey Adams, whose talents were put on fuller display in Chasing Amy.  Through it all, the very funny and witty screenplay shines, making Mallrats worth watching.",Mallrats

The eagerly anticipated sequel-prequel-whatever to ""Clerks"" was met with harsh claims of selling out and cheating fans of a true Kevin Smith movie.  Hogwash.  Mallrats is a fine installment of The Jersey Trilogy (or series, with the release of Dogma) and provides endless laughs that will make you keep coming back for more.Jeremy London, as the troubled T.S. Quint, makes the best performance of his career and has great chemistry with the rest of the cast.  It is Jason Lee, as best-friend and newly-single Brodie Bruce, who dominates their scenes.  A man with a pathetic lifestyle who couldn't be prouder to admit to it, Brodie provides some of the best (and oddest) lines in the movie. However, despite both these wonderful performances, two characters who have become icons of the teen world steal the show from top to bottom.  Jay and Silent Bob, the two drug pushers with enough weird gadgets to make James Bond jealous, provide some of the best and most memorable moments in the movie.

(and I'm a 32 year old woman who went into Philly to see Clerks when it first came out back in 94 - best $10 I ever spent !!!) How can you not love watching Silent Bob ""fly"" ?!?! How can you not lose your cookies when Brodie talks about masturbation and ""chocolate-covered pretzels"". I may have a deeper love for Randal, Silent Bob, Jay, Holden, Alyssa, Dante and Banky, but T.S. and Brodie still rock a mall like no one else !!!",Mallrats
254,hucklejarod,A funny Kevin smith movie,7,8 November 2021,I seen this a few time and it's really funny I like Kevin smith movies they are funny. I seen most of his movies they are really good. Since I was a teenager I like all of his movies and I still like them. So if you like Kevin smith movies you should watch this it's really funny.,Mallrats
255,Matt06-81,Gets funnier every time I see it,10,22 May 2002,"When I first saw this film I don't think I could have really been concentrating because, although I liked it, I didn't think it was outstanding. However, since then I have seen it probably another 7 or 8 times and it now ranks, in my opinion, as one of the funniest films ever. Every time I watch it there seems to be a new joke in it that I missed before and Kevin Smith's humour is so subtle and clever that every new joke makes you laugh so hard you can't breathe.The film is amazing, if you didn't like it the first time you saw it, go and watch it again, and again, and again, you WILL love it.10/10",Mallrats
256,snootchieboochies,a classic,10,28 February 2002,"As a lot of you will know Mallrats is the second of kevin smiths New Jersey trilogy and in my opinion is of unsurpassed brilliance. Although the trademark witty dialogue of kevins films is not quite as good as in its predecessor Clerks, this film is still up there and is one of the funniest films I have ever seen. In fact it is easily in my top 10 films ever.This film deserves 10 out of 10",Mallrats
257,rasta_dude15,Brodie Rocks!!,9,23 May 2002,"Mallrats is a really fun movie.  Its the second installment in the Jersey Trilogy, and my personal favorite.  In comparison to Clerks the film's cinamatography is a whole lot better, and I really enjoy the color.  A lot of people might complain about the lack of a message, or deeper meening, but sometimes movies are just supposed to be for fun.  I enjoyed the characters in this film more than most, Brodie being my favorite.  His love of comic books hits close to home, and did you know that Kevin Smith works with comic books himself, he is now leading the new Green Arrow books(just a bit of trivia).  Jay and Silent Bob are bigger characters in this film and I love their crazy antics.  And finally T.S.'s character provides some philisofical dialoge that is refreshing and really ties the film together.",Mallrats
258,Foshy,Great Film,9,3 August 2002,"Alright let me start this out by saying to most of u people, no offense, but u suck.. Ok first of all how can u say that you love all the other Kevin Smith films but hate this one? Look at Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, definately the worst Smith film to date.. The jokes are all stupid and are nothing but gay bashing jokes.. And by the way, I'm not gay. And Dogma, wow.. That movie kinda sucked too.. Jay and Silent Bob were pretty much worthless in that movie and Jason Lee didnt have a big enough part to make the movie good.. And then Chasing Amy, this one is actually great.. Jay and Silent Bob are barely in this film, which isn't bad.. Those two are supposed to just make appearances in films, not a whole film about them.. And this film was great, Kevin Smith stayed with some of his comic humor and his roots. Next the greatest film, Mallrats.. This movie is just flat out funny, especially the game show scene.. But every second there is just bout a joke in this film, so incase u people are too stupid to realize that, well, then tough luck.. And well since there is Clerks I will talk bout that too.. That film is awesome, all I have to say is, 37?",Mallrats
259,absolutsjk,thank god for dvd,7,14 July 2002,"Being Kevin Smith's first ""big"" budget flick after the indie hit Clerks, people were expecting a lot, perhaps too much, and the film really ended up floundering.  The movie itself isn't bad, in fact , its pretty damn funny, and better than most stuff that hollywood puts out..but the best part of teh film couldn't have been seen in theaters. The commentary track on the the laserdisc and dvd has to be funnier than 99% of actual movies, it alone is worth the price of the disc. Also, the deleted scenes really add the story have things kinda make more sense. For instance, there is 45 minutes cut oout of the beginning of the movie. Removing this kinda changed the whole meaning of the movie as well as some jokes in the flick.",Mallrats

262,Captain_fantastic,Kevin Smith is a Brilliant young writer/director,10,23 August 2003,"Although he seemed to be somewhat disappointed by his movie, and from what I gather so did most of the reviewers and audiences, I found this to be one of Kevin's better movies.  Maybe it was because I saw this one after I had already seen Dogma and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, but now I got some of those great ""in-jokes"" that were included in those movies.  Of course the running gags and themes that present themselves from one movie to the next make this a real gem. Anyone who doesn't appreciate these films and this writer and director needs serious therapy....And no, I am not related to the guy....",Mallrats

It boasts a ""hot, young"" director and a cast of likeable characters that like to cuss a lot. Add a hip soundtrack, and you've got the complete package.

If on the other hand you enjoyed the pre pubescent humour and smart dialogue then Mallrats could be just up your street!This movie is funny with a capital F. Featuring a star turn from skate king Jason Lee, Batman-esquire stunts, Charmed queen Shannon Doherty, BenAffleck (when he was still good) and the classic 'stinky palm' scene (you gotta see it to know it) this is NOT to be missed.And if you've yet to encounter snoochy-boochy stoners Jay & Silent Bob, then where the hell have you been living?!

265,Mr_Kim,I keep coming back for more...,10,8 November 2004,"For me a movie can't receive that perfect ten if I can't watch it over and over. This is one of those rare tens. Kevin Smith's second installment in his Jersey saga tells the tale of teenage angs and heartbreak with the perfect mix of cynical humor and slap stick. It ends somewhere between the cruder humor displayed in his later Jay and Silent Bob strikes back feature and the more dialogue based cynicism expressed within Clerks.It showcases Jason Lee as the slacking comic book fan Brodie Bruce. Jason does what he does best and here he is in his element with the witty remarks ever flowing. Other cast worth mentioning is Michael Rooker doing his ""on the edge"" shtick once more as the slightly mental nemesis. Clair Forlani plays the heartbroken girlfriend and a host of other Kevin Smith peeps shows up in various roles. Brian O'Halloran shows up in several roles including the unknown relative to his Clerks character Dante (this is a gimmick that shows up in all the Jersey saga movies). They even squeezed Ben Affleck in there for all you Phantoms peeps out thereAll in all this is a feel good movie that will keep you entertained as you watch it even for the fifth time. Good pacing keep you immersed and the balance between the different styles of humor helps it feeling fresh all though the movie. Loaded with pop-culture references it's all you ever wanted in a Kevin Smith movie.",Mallrats
266,nyc88,Well Worth Digging Up,8,24 August 2009,"One of the hardest tests for any film is the passage of time. After around a decade, a fine line emerges between a movie capturing an enduring snapshot of a particular period's culture, and having references become dated to the point of unwatchability. Stumbling across Mallrats on HBO this past week, I was reminded that the movie falls solidly into the former camp. Mallrats captures the teenage culture of the early-nineties like few other movies- a still pre-internet, pre-cell phone time when bored kids had to congregate at the local mall for social interaction. Mallrats is delightfully peppered with now largely forgotten nineties elements: magic eye pictures, Shannon Doherty at her hottest, VCR's, men with shoulder length hair, a dating game, and even a pre-J Lo Ben Affleck.The straight-forward structure of the Mallrats plot provides an effective platform for the character interaction that makes the movie. The story centers around two friends, TS and Brodie (Jeremy London and Jason Lee), who head to the mall to try to drown their sorrows in ""the smell of commerce"" after both being dumped in the first 10 minutes of the movie. TS's plot to hijack his ex-girlfriend's dating show allows for a series of Wile E. Coyote inspired attempts by Jay and Silent Bob (the same characters from Clerks), aimed at overcoming the head of mall security and destroying the gameshow's set. The middle body of the film consists of these antics along with TS and Brodie generally wasting time at the mall with entertainingly arbitrary discussions. Events build towards the friends finding the resolve to reclaim their women.Despite its endearing traits, the movie is not without weaknesses. TS and his ex-girlfriend Brandi (played by Claire Forlani) bring little to the table but bad acting and awkward dialog. TS (London), though supposedly the main character, is generally off-putting and hard to root for. Also, Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith), while entertaining, are not at their best. The fact that the studio reportedly made Kevin Smith tone down some of the vulgar dialog probably accounts for Jason Mewes's inability to shine.However, there is plenty in Mallrats to make up for its shortcomings. Ben Affleck brings more than enough firepower to his role as a typical cocky Jersey mall salesman (""I have no respect for people with no shopping agenda""), trying to take advantage of Brodie's ex-girlfriend (""in a very uncomfortable place""), and Michael Rooking provides an effective villain, playing TS's girlfriend's father, who spends the movie trying to keep TS away from his daughter.More than anything, though, Jason Lee (Brodie) steals the movie. He dominates every scene he is in with some of the most incisively random dialog in recent decades. From loudly complaining about negligent parents allowing a kid to play on the mall escalator (who later gets caught in it), to saving the ending dating game show with lines like his insistence that he be called ""the second suitor"" rather than ""suitor number two"", Lee puts forward what should be considered one of the iconic comedy performances of the nineties. His barrage of mini-monologues and one-liners are by far the most memorable part of the movie, never better than when he adamantly argues with TS that the mall cookie stand is not part of the food court but that it should be classified as ""as an autonomous unit for mid-mall snacking"".It had been at least 10 years since I'd seen Mallrats, and I couldn't have been happier to rediscover it. If you're looking for a trip down nineties memory lane and an hour and a half of laugh out loud comedy (mostly provided by Jason Lee), than Mallrats is well worth dusting off.",Mallrats
267,timmbradley,This is an Awesome film!,10,22 August 2005,"Some people say that Mallrats was disappointing, I however believe that this is completely untrue. Kevin Smith is a genius and this film is often the favourite among Kevin Smith fans. Jason Lee is hilarious and Stan Lee is great. Silent Bob does a great batman impression. I think the problem was that people were expecting an artistic film after clerks success at the Sundance film festival, I wasn't disappointed but then i wasn't very old when clerks was first released. I think Mallrat's success on video speaks for itself. It is a great moment when Jay and Silent Bob are seen for the first time in colour. I see this film as just as much of a landmark as Clerks and I wish it was shown as much respect.",Mallrats
268,croberts-11535,wearing out it's welcome,5,10 July 2018,"Smith does have an ear for good dialogue (i.e his first movie Clerks), and when the stars align can make good movies (Chasing Amy). But by the time ""Mallrats"" came out, this particular style became tiresome. It was like a decently budget movie was made out of material only he and his friends thought was funny. I don't blame the guy for making it (as difficult as it is to get a movie made), but this feels like it was all the jokes not good enough to make it in ""Clerks"". Like that album a label puts out after the singer is dead. Just tracks that were laying around the studio.",Mallrats

Though this movie barely had a plot, it was freaking awesome. There is no better director than Kevin Smith, he is the master of comedy.There is absolutely nothing bad about this film, it is freaking hilarious. All that hate this movie suck ass. No one is better than Jay and Silent Bob, the funniest duo to hit the box office. Two of Kevin Smith's movies, Mallrats and Clerks, had me crying in laughter with the sexual humor. I absolutely love everyone of his movies, even Chasing Amy was good. Hell, I'm evolutionist and i loved Dogma, how weird is that? I cant wait for the next one of his movies to come out, Clerks 2, yeah bitches. No comedy director can match the power of Kevin Smith and Jay and Silent Bob!",Mallrats

No, it was as not a step forward from Clerks, but Kevin Smith needn't have apologized for it.  Yes, it is sort of dumb (although not especially so by current standards), but it has more than enough laughs to work quite well on a ""Caddyshack"" level. Well worth a rental.",Mallrats
275,Swan-7,Well Posh!!!!!!!!,10,10 January 1999,"This is an excellent film and should be seen by all fans of John Hughes films (meaning his films from the 80's). I laughed 'til I cried. A lovely departure from ""Clerks"". Although some ""Clerks"" fans may not like this film, it must be seen for what it is, an entertaining comedy that doesn't require thought.

This movie concentrates on many other types of humor,while Clerks and Chasing Amy have way too many sexual references.  This movie proves he can still be very funny without so many of them. Jay and Silent Bob add the little Abbott and Costello humor and Brodie is just demonic so he is always funny. Great flick!!!",Mallrats

But in my view this is the best Kevin Smith film made to date. Jason Lee's outstanding performance as Brodie is the funniest that I've ever seen. His beating of the grannies, just because of his principles, is histerical. Jay and silent Bob are here as usual. All in all, I suggest that if you have not yet seen this film, you do!!

For some reason it holds some kind of aura about it prob because i was drunk the first time I watched it. But what it has that that makes it stand above the rest of the teen-flick heap is an original funny script by Kevin Smith, a type of script that I had never witnessed before having not seen ""Clerks"".

Mallrats was the funniest movie of them all I think. How can you go wrong with quotes like...""You're going to listen to something I said?

London fits well into a confused role, Jason Lee is hilarious throughout whilst Lauren-Adams , Mewes, Smith and Forlani enable the balance of romance and humour.

285,schiele1,Did Kevin Smith set out to make the worst film in history?,1,17 July 2001,"I've seen some bad films in my time. I've seen some films that could most charitably be described as rotten. But 'Mallrats' beat them all. It not only made my list of the ten worst movies of all time, it took first place on the list.I kept waiting for someone to act. No one ever did. I waited for the director to show that he had some idea of what film making is all about. That never happened. I thought that, at least, the writing would eventually show that there was some reason why this film was made, but when the credits finally, mercifully, rolled, no reason whatever had yet appeared.I'll say this for the movie, though: it didn't score a perfect '10' and so achieve the distinction of being a total loss. There was one scene where, for between three and ten seconds, something approaching reality actually took place. That was when T.S.'s old girlfriend kicked him in the groin.I just hope that audiences and the motion picture industry don't hold this movie against the cast. Perhaps, just perhaps, a few of them may actually have the ability to entertain. If so, in this movie, they never got a chance to show it.If Mr. Smith decides he wants to produce and direct another film, I'd strongly advise him to get a fifth grader to write his screenplay. He'd be light years ahead.",Mallrats
286,CrxRcr,Not the come back we expected,7,16 July 2000,"Albeit a disappointing second feature from the creator of clerks, on its own merit this film is witty and entertaining. Kevin Smith is constantly persecuted for this film from he same people who gave him accolades for Clerks and it needs to be understood he just wanted to make a simple easy film, and if you have seen the DVD, it must be understood this film was heavily cut into an almost entirely different movie. Anyhow its not really about much except the day in the  life of the 2 major characters, and how they must both score their women back after they coincidently break up the same morning. Jay and silent Bob become richer livelier characters through this film and root their place (I feel) in the Kevin smith genre. Ben Afflect makes his first (of many) appearance into the Kevin Smith genre. And last, but certainly not least, Jason Lee makes his first foray into the Kevin Smith genre and is absolutely amazing. All in all its a fun movie you cant expect much more out of than a national lampoon flick, so just kick back, relax, listen, and take a trip to the mall.",Mallrats

Mallrats follows a day in the lives of some Jersey kids at the mall.  Luckily enough, Mallrats has been able to find its audience on video and DVD release.This was to be the studio movie that would appeal to a large demographic and allow Kevin Smith to make more smaller niche movies.  Screenings of Mallrats were well-received, even by some executives, awards were even being considered, but when the grosses for the first night of release came in at $400,000 that soon ended.  Its shortcomings were not the film itself, but rather the marketing campaign made for it, or as the commentary on the DVD says, ""See Mallrats: starring Jason Lee, a guy you've never heard of, and Shannen Doherty, a girl you hate.""If you liked Clerks, you'll like Mallrats, it's even in color.

Jay and Silent Bob crack me up, and Jason Lee's philosophies give me plenty to quote. The only one better than this is 'Dogma'. Also, loads of backing for legalization. Nooch . . .",Mallrats
294,Matt Bellamy,"A very good, if slightly uneven comedy",7,17 March 2002,"I had heard a lot about the films of Kevin Smith before I actually took the time to check out his early work.  The first of his films I saw was Dogma. Which I thought was very average for a director with some of the most die-hard fans I've ever seen.  Dogma had some very good segments, however, they were far too interspersed for my liking.  Then one day in the video shop I saw Clerks, so I rented it.  I was completely blown away, this was a marvellous example of independent filmmaking and was without doubt the best comedy I had seen in a long time and is without doubt his best film.  The following day I went and rented Mallrats.  I wasn't as impressed, but there were still some very good moments in the film.  However, there were also some really irritating aspects.  The acting in Mallrats is the worse than any other Kevin Smith film.  Whilst Jay's acting improved greatly from Clerks, there were some bits where he appears really amateurish, for example when the security guards are chasing him and Silent Bob, however the first shot of him and Silent Bob is brilliant.  The biggest criminal of all though has to be Michael Rooker who plays Brandi's father; I'm surprised he ever got an acting job again after this performance.  However, Jason Lee is superb in this film giving one of his best performances.  This film is really quite uneven; one minute you're on the receiving end of some of Smith's best work and the next you're wondering why you are watching this film.  However, despite this I would say there are more hits than misses and the film is quite enjoyable.  Unfortunately this film saw in the revival of the teen comedy genre and many films try to imitate Mallrats.  However, instead of copying or trying to recreate the best aspects of Mallrats, they recreate its worst aspects.  Therefore, this is far from Smith's best work and is responsible for the subsequent flood of teen comedies.  I think that if you took the quality of the Clerks script along with Randall Graves, add it to the Mallrats soundtrack with Jason Lee's performance in the film, then added the subject matter of Chasing Amy and Jay and Silent Bob's performance in Jay and Silent Bob strike back, you would have the perfect Kevin Smith film.  However, this is not Smith's worst film as Dogma definitely claims that title.  This is a very good if uneven comedy, which you will not regret renting.  Top five moments from this film: 1.

295,negativeindustrial,Best Movie I've ever Seen,10,4 April 2007,"Best Movie I've ever Seen and I watch an ass-load of movies. Loved the comic and Star Wars tributes and who can't resist the chance to watch Stan Lee move as well as talk - the man truly is a legend. And I thought I was the only one who pondered superhero's sexual exploits? This was the first movie in the View-Askew line up I ever saw and I still consider it to be better than the rest by far (even Clerks I and II). It's also the first movie I've ever seen that ""read"" like a comic ad was so obviously influenced by comics and obviously written for comics lovers. I truly hope Kevin Smith makes more movies like this. Long live Jay and Silent Bob! Enough ass kissing from me. Nuff said.",Mallrats
296,belly483,Wow Wow Wow this is so funny,10,8 January 2002,This film is the best film ever - pure genius its so funny and i have seen it too many times now but it still makes me laugh evry1 shud c this film cos its so funny - kevin smith is a genius and evry1 shud recognise this buy this film - you will laff so much :P,Mallrats
297,Toshman8,Why this film is the greatest!,10,26 March 2002,"If you've seen this film you either love it or you hate it. In my mind Kevin Smith is a genius and his films are clever and witty, like him or not. The superb dialogue is crammed with stylish references to classics (not to mention his other work) such as the Star Wars trilogy, Jaws and the seemingly never ending superman phenomenon and lets not forget Smith's obsession with John Hughes. It's these factors that make Mallrats an instant classic which I feel never got the recognition it really deserved. If you look at the plot then ok it's not groundbreaking nor realistic however, it sets the scene for the real point of the movie which is entertainment. From the ridiculous discussion between brodie and T.S about Superman's potential heir to Jay and Silent Bob's bumbling schemes to bring about the demise of a live gameshow you can't help but think ""Wow I've never had that conversation, why the hell not?"" this leads me on to the stars of The View Askewniverse (Smiths world in which all of his films take place). Jay and Silent Bob. These two goons played by the director and his real life pal are without a doubt the funniest comedic duo that I have laid eyes on. Jay a scruffy dealer with attitude and his heteral life mate a chubby follower that utters but a sentence per film appearance, manage to steal the best lines, sequences and stunts in all of Smiths films (Maybe not chasing amy) Jay's constant vulgarisms and view on life should be enough to make anyone laugh. Anyways what do I know, get this movie and judge for yourself, I'm sure you'll like what you see.",Mallrats
298,Ecko7245,Mallrats is great,10,12 April 2002,Mallrats is the greatest movie ever made! Whoever hasn't seen this movie needs to see it. Go rent this movie right now! i'm telling you its worth it. Its got a really good cast in it Jason Lee and Joey Lauren Adams it doesn't get any better than that.One More thing all Kevin Smith Movies rule!,Mallrats
299,Arsam,Great unique comedy that is funny on so many different levels,10,26 June 2003,"Mallrats is one of the greatest movies of the mid 90s and you should own it because you are worthless without it. Kevin Smith Came out with Mallrats after his huge success Clerks. But unlike Clerks this movie did really poorly at the box office. First off I'd like to begin by saying this movie is a teenage movie that is sort of like a porky, except for the fact that Kevin Smith is funnier than just a porky type of movie and that is why this movie isn't as popular as it should be..BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE STUPID. and Kevin knows that by now and that is why he made Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, so that the average teenager can understand and laugh like an idiot and then go tell those awful jokes to his other retarded friends and they'll understand and so on ..Kevin Smith is a sell out in my book but Mallrats will always be a classic",Mallrats
300,NotoriousChronic,Kevin Smith Fan.,10,19 January 2003,Well I have always been a fan of Kevin Smith.  This is one of the original View Askew movies we all love.  I can't wait for the next.  Brodie Bruce is a charactor that none of us will easily forget.  Jay and Silent Bob gave us yet another brilliant performance of there outlook on life and they're art of dick and fart jokes.  Affleck rocks as Shannen Hamilton and I cannot get enough of Ethan Suplee and the Magic Eye.,Mallrats
301,mikesettemio,mallrats is a film about two friends who find that they have both been dumped by their significant others and head to the mall in an attempt to get there girl friends back.,7,1 September 2010,"All thought mallrats was a flop in the theaters it has now found its fan base on DVD. If you are wondering why that is I truly believe it is because it was simply ahead of its time. Visually mallrats isn't much to look at but if you are aware of Kevin smiths work you know that he generally does two angle still shots. So instead of capturing you visually he does comically. Imediatly when the film starts you are told a hilarious story told by Jason lee and all thought i do not want to ruin it i will say it is one of my personal favorite scenes. Also aside from the comedy this film has a very real feel to it and a decent plot. I recommend purchasing the mallrats 10th anniversary extended edition because it has both the theatrical and extended versions of the film. And a wide variety of special features including cast interviews from the original set, a brief Q and A with Kevin smith, out takes, viewaskews look back at mallrats, the erection of an epic-the making of mallrats, mallrats reunion, a great feature commentary with Kevin smith Jason lee and Ben affleck, and much more! So if you are a real movie buff like my self or just a view askew fan i recommend this film for you. You can pick it up for just about ten bucks and you really are getting your moneys worth with this one. This film is a must have for any movie collection.",Mallrats
302,dylandevil,Stinkpalm !!,10,15 July 2003,"What can I say about this movie.  It's got everything...drama, comedy, action, romance, and even a little grossness to it's plot.  Where else can you see one man break up with his girlfriend, go to the mall, help destroy a friend's ex girlfriend's father's television game show, stinkpalm a couple people, find a couple hooligans to help you along the way and have time to have sex in an elevator?  NOWHERE...that's why this movie has it all. Character development is a big big part of movies and this one has development of 2 memorable characters who we would see in a later film...""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"".  Kevin Smith excels as director (and actor as Silent Bob).  This movie also launched the career of Jason Lee who played the comic loving, video game playing, mallrat of a crazy fool Brodie Bruce.  Lee has gone on to star in such films in Stealing Harvard, A Guy Thing, Dogma, and Almost Famous.  The movie makes you laugh uncontrollably in parts where you KNOW something funny is going to happen yet still laugh because it's outrageous.  I highly reccomend this flick to all who are looking for a great comedy that's got it all.",Mallrats
303,JayandSilentBobChick,"Jay, what can I say?",10,27 July 2003,"Yes, Jason Mewes.  He practically brings the whole movie together along with Kevin Smith.  They kinda add the funniness to the movie. What can I say? They're Jay and Silent Bob, they have to be funny.  This has to be one of my favorite movies definitely, considering the fact that I am a teenager and enjoy movies like this.  I also like the fact that it takes place in a mall, considering I am a shopaholic and go to the mall every week.Good job Kevin.",Mallrats
304,liam-west1,Whats not to love!?!,10,14 August 2003,"To start off with, Jay and Silent Bob rock as always, T.S. is a little anal but that adds to his overall character and pans out to his advantage at the end of the film, Willam is underrated, Brandi and father are a great example of a modern day middle class father/daughter relationship, (and she FINE to!!!), even the lovely Shannen Doherty deserves usually unwarranted praise if just for the lift scene, but the star of the whole movie has got to be Brodie. If not for the preoccupation with superhero sex organs, supermans potential birth control or possible future realistic child bearing partners, then just simply for the answer to what noises do you make when you're having whoopee. According to commentary said noise was supplied by the unappreciated in our time Jay mewesey mewes but delivered with such conviction that i use it as my answerphone message on my cell. Kevin Smith, View Askew, boys, you all did yourselves proud. Even your commentaries are better than most of the other films floating around the cinemas for the past decade. Thank you for making a sad man and best friend very happy.",Mallrats
305,BoomPowBeth,"Say, would you like a chocolate covered pretzel?",10,8 December 2011,"Mallrats has been and will always be my favorite Kevin Smith flick. Brilliant and witty writing which is Smith's fort-ay, make this film a gem. Jason Lee was the perfect choice for Brodie, his delivery is great. I don't really understand why people dog this movie, it's not for everybody, I agree. But,that's the beauty of choice, if you don't dig it, move on! Smith really seems to be writing for my generation and our whacked out sense of humor. He gets inside your head and you find yourself laughing thinking, ""Hey, I would do the same thing!"". Not too many people take such big chances in the movie industry now a days. Same old boring crap. But I think that Mallrats captures what comic book nerds and love fiends on the east coast feel sometimes.I am very satisfied with the ending of the movie, glad there was a happy ending. I love this movie and think if more people gave it a chance,they too would fall in love.",Mallrats
306,acqua_55555,"In my opinon, one of the best movies ever...",10,22 January 2004,"I first saw this movie 6 years ago when it was played during CBC's Summer Movie slot and loved it instantly. Flash-forward to now and I am the proud owner of a Mallrats DVD. I can not get enough of this movie and the hilarious audio commentary by Kevin and crew. For those who have not listened to the commentary track, do so...it has some of the funniest comments I've heard in a long time. One line in particular by Affleck had me laughing for 5 minutes...funny stuff....Check it out folks...it is a classic",Mallrats
307,GandalfShaw,classic new jersey trilogy,10,17 February 2004,"Mallrats was always going to be critically judged after the greatness of smith's first film Clerks and its following success. However, despite this it proved that Kevin had more than one story to tell and this movie was responsible for continuing the growing cult movement surrounding the new jersey trilogy. The story did seen sort of rushed in contrast to Clerks and many characters seemed too obscure to be actually believable. Nevertheless, the introduction of Ben Affleck in his first movie role worked very well in providing a sub plot. The movie was non stop hilarity from the outset and many fans of Kevin's viewaskew will recognise several in-movie jokes surrounding the actors. In many ways this movie is actually superior to Clerks in its dialogue and the beautifully and skillfully decorated mall in which the film is set. Smith handles the scene shots much more professionally than in Clerks and is very reminiscent of his later film Chasing Amy. Amy is a far greater film than Mallrats but that should not stop you from buying this film either as it will still soon become a treasured possession of your film collection and you will be quoting the characters for months afterwards. Overall, a job well done by the great Kevin Smith.",Mallrats
308,david007007,Jason Lee is King,9,2 March 2004,"Mallrats was a great movie.  It was very funny.  A Movie Classic.  Jason Lee is just superb in this movie as Broadie.  He is such a talented and funny Actor.  He should do more movies.  Who could forget Jay and Silent Bob, One of the best comedic duos ever put in film. Snoochie Boochies.  I was glad after clerks to see these two more in a movie.  They were just pure genius. Coming from one who likes the mall and loves comic books this movie was just perfect.  Ethan Suplee just chillin at the mall all day trying to see the sailboat is just classic.  Its loaded with one liners and plenty of quotes that are just hilarious.  I've seen this movie at least a couple dozen times already.",Mallrats
309,rjbworldtour,meh...not as good as clerks,5,31 March 2004,"If anyone wants to see a good Kevin Smith movie, rent Clerks, Chasing Amy or Dogma (even Jersey Girl is probably better). Just don't talk to me in public and tell me you like Smith's films if you base it on whether or not you like Mallrats even he's admitted that it wasn't his best work. It's still funnier than most flicks, and I admit I own a used copy of the video (that I bought four or five years ago, and only because it is part of the set of the other movies) and watch it with the other movies by Smith in marathon sittings, but I don't think I'll buy the soundtrack or special DVD.Then again, I can recite all the lines, (you called on the thunder, and now you've got it is one of my favorites) so you be the judge. Also, check out the Evening with Kevin Smith DVD--it's like having a conversation with the man in your living room--highly entertaining. The Clerks cartoons are among my favorites as well.",Mallrats
310,kbelciglio,It's Marvelous!,10,4 April 2004,"An interesting movie that begins with a rather simple set-up, and then descends into silliness, absurdity, elevator sex, comments on escalator safety, and finally, sweetness.  It has an underlying romantic message that shows, once again, that comic-book nerds have at their core a heart as big and syrupy as a Sally Fields movie.Seriously, I heartily endorse this movie.  Fine family entertainment - two thumbs up!  It is not only a date movie-chick flick with action sequences, it's way fun to identify all the Kevin Smith movie characters and enjoy Ben Affleck as a sleazy clothing-store manager with an affinity for the ""chocolate"" highway.  (UGH! - now we know why Jennifer really broke up with him!)",Mallrats
311,el_guapo0022,Addicted to movies,10,28 June 2004,"Loved it, Smith's dialogue is BRILLIANT. Characters were well rounded, and the story very well put together. Though not my favorite now, it was when I saw it. His choice to use his friends in the movie, instead of some Hollywood cast was admirable and risky at the same time. Very disappointed he didn't use his cum joke, he would have made some serious money. Back to what did make it into the movie, Jay and Silent Bob busting into Adams in the dressing room was great though I'm gay, and not attracted to Joey Lauren Adams, found it to be a memorable scene, classic Animal House homage. The inclusion of Stan Lee was a real treat, was very excited to see his appearance, especially when in the movie, after his inspirational speech, he was originally going one way, afterwards decided to go the other way....for no apparent reason. All in all, am a huge Smith fan, love his movies!!!",Mallrats
312,DarthVader182,MY favorite movie of all time...,10,14 July 2004,"I must say, ""Mallrats"" is an awesome movie. It was a film that found its own audience. I for one love it! It's an awesome follow up to Kevin Smith's first film, which everyone should know, ""Clerks"". I remember watching the making on the DVD, and they said that when it was released, it didn't do so well, but again, it is a type of film that found its own audience, which I think is cool. There is not a lot of films out there like that. It's unique, funny, and smart. Jason Lee (Brodie Bruce) was great in this film! His smart-allic sense of humor made me love his character. Two thumbs up for him, and two thumbs up to Kevin Smith for making such a great movie....",Mallrats
313,kurtwbillups,Because he cares.......,9,4 July 2005,"Another choice selection of thoughts from Director Kevin Smith's brain. If Kevin is anything like the guys I grew up with, he has much more of this type of highly entertaining fare. The crime here is that Smith doesn't do more work than he does. Surrounded by talented friends, Kevin's movies should always be can't miss. Kevin Smith makes my very short list of people I would like to spend an evening with, knocking back beers and telling amusing anecdotes. Wish I'd grown up with the guy.Mallrats takes place in the rich world that Smith has created for himself, a working mans pseudo-intellectual paradise, where Smith himself reins supreme and the gloves are off when it comes to topics like Star Wars, snowballing and sex with the recently deceased. A direct parallel could be drawn between Mark Twain and Smith himself. Only in Smith's world, Tom and Huck don't so much journey across land, but more across pop culture.",Mallrats
314,brogan_darren,"Excellent film, one of my favourites!",9,13 July 2005,"This is one, if no thee best movies from director Kevin Smith. The strange thing is that although being essentially another cheesy romantic comedy, the viewer can pretty much put this this underlying love element to the side and enjoy a very clever and cracking comedy. The comedy is very subtle more often than not, but combined with some slapstick jokes creates the perfect blend. The Jay and Silent Bob characters provide the slapstick element whereas the comic book crazed Brody provides the intelligent sarcastic humour to the film.The story follows the two lead characters Brody and TS, as TS tries to win back his recently separated girlfriend. Along the way they meet and bump into a number of comedic friends that all, in a manner of speaking work together in order to help TS on his quest. Incerdibly funny and enjoyable to watch, 100% recommended! DB",Mallrats
315,twmurphy,critique of mallrats,10,12 September 2004,"overbashed?? I say so, cause it provides some light into the jersey trilogy. It's more or less the epicenter of the whole trilogy. It provides substantiation into the storyline of clerks. Love all Kevin's work, hope to see more in the future. Innovative, and smart comedy - something that's missing in today's society. He doesn't insult our intelligence, just because we like ""dick and fart jokes"". Take care, whoever reads this. I'm hoping this gets to Kevin Smith himself, because I'm a true fan of him and his work, but if it gets to someone than Mewes I'll be happy enough. HA HA, just kidding. Mewes is the bomb. Take care all, thanks for reading this. P.S. - if you're really nice, you'd send this military thug with some free View Askew swag...yeah, just because I'm in the military doesn't mean I support them - I'll always support View Askew though, keeping true to my roots - NJ represent!!!

316,Beefman_no1,Critically mall-ed yet its a great movie!,9,5 May 2005,"I know, i know this film may not be a technical masterpiece as shown with some problems in continuity as seen with the re-shoots shots inserted in the final scenes with Claire Forlani, yet this film manages to entertain throughout, and is that what movies are created for in the first place. Movies simply have one aim and that is to create enjoyment for the viewer and this film does that. Every scene that involves Jason Lee is a joy to watch, for example when Brodie and TS first enter the mall and Brodie's shock and damage speech is interrupted by a stage cross beam and a reoccurring bit character, the speed of delivery of the following lines coupled with Lee's expression is hilarious. He brings this character to life and is by far the greatest thing about this movie. Thats not to say that hes the only thing to watch this movie for because the moments with Ethan suplee are also really entertaining, the moment with the children being a particular favourite of mine. Then there are some downfalls, stink palming, Jeremy London's constant arm crossing and it being labelled a clever porkys yet its a good lark of a film and does exactly what it says on the tin. Maybe it would not have been as slated by the critics if the original opening at the governors ball had been kept in the original script but sometimes things inevitably have to change and yet the film remains to be entertaining throughout and so my hat goes off to Kevin smith and Mr Mosier for making a great film!!",Mallrats
317,pumpkined,Great film!,10,29 November 2004,"This film is great! Jason Lee and Jeremy London are great actors, especially to say this is Lee's first Feature Film. Kevin Smith is one of my alltime favourite directors/writers. But if your into ""massive budget"" films with a load of famous actors in this movie proberbly isn't for you. I can't help but mention Jay And Silent Bob, who play a rather great part in this film, Jason Mewes is a good actor who does, in my eyes, have good potential. So overall this movie is a good film that I could watch time and time again and for people who are interested in making their own movies this film can be a great inspiration. It's worth buying on DVD as the commentary is a great laugh and you get a good load of great info on the film.",Mallrats

Never mind.Mallrats is the tale of two guys whose girlfriends break up with them. Semi-depressed, they attempt to find solace in the warm, loving bosom of the local mall and, on the way, meet a plethora of strange and interesting characters, including the recent pop culture pariahs, Jay & Silent Bob.

319,DiamondGeezertob,amazing you are not a Kevin smith fan unless you give this a 10,9,30 January 2005,this film is incredible although the box office ratings were shocking a man that can make a film while only using two actual camera moving shots i would buy a drink anytime. This man is a legend and has made many great films in his life. I know jersey girl was a flop but that was because it was an awful film but we are all allowed to make mistakes and all of you so called film buffs who insult the smith for making jersey girl i admit you are all gods and have never made a mistake in your life and there for you can judge him. Smith is an old school director who has genuine love for film creation and is not the money grabbing hound you all make him out to be. He will carry on making cult classics but will of course make mistakes (jersey girl) but does not deserve to be punished for it. So all you little middle aged guys living with your parents f*$k off and stop analysing this legend.bass.,Mallrats
320,imdb-2-emoore,I love this movie!,8,2 April 2005,"I think it's because I was living in Alabama at the time, trying to finish college, but I absolutely loved this movie when I saw it. I think I was envious of the nice clothes and the great mall they had at their disposal. Trust me, you take things like that for granted when you're forced to live in a place like Alabama for a while. I'm sure it was just the frame of mind I was in when I saw it, but I really, really love this movie. Brodie, (Jason Lee,) steals every scene. Claire Forlani and Jeremy London are the weakest links, as neither one can act their way out of a wet douche bag. Jason Lee, Shannen ""Picasso Face"" Doherty and, as much as I hate to admit it, Ben Affleck make it worthwhile.",Mallrats
321,terestenyi,Mall turds,1,30 April 2009,"This movie does not last for 10 years, as Clerks has. This is a terrible movie, with bland jokes and a horrible plot. Only Silent Bob and Jay is the only redeeming character in the movie. Even some of the special effects, try to be realistic, are just awful. I had watched the movie, in the 10 year edition, with special introduction by Silent Bob, and commented that he added 30 minutes of extra footage to this movie. This movie needed 30 minutes cut, not added. I think much more attention should have been given to the mall characters, and less to the Dad, and that horrible game show. Try watching Clerks II, a much better and classic movie, which will span the test of time. There, is that 10 lines?",Mallrats
322,sidpachy,"Funny,Youth Oriented,Fresh,Surprisingly Insightful",9,15 June 2005,An Excellent comedy linking desperate characters via the medium of a mall. The USP of the movie is Jason Lee's boxer like jabs of comedy that keep coming one after the another and of course the antics of J and silent Bob.On a more serious note the movie has no profound meaning or logic behind it but nevertheless the its so natural that it can definitely hold its own.Its a movie that caters to the youth. However it would have been even better if Jeremy London and Ben Affleck did some real acting rather than just stand there. Well every movie has a few glitches but overall two thumbs up to Kevin Smith for encapsulating the youth mentality .( A must see),Mallrats

TS is TS with Brandi, because TS is TS, like Brandi says, TS.Sorry, I really had to let that out.

I will continue to love this movie, and I'm hoping they release an updated version like they did with clerks. I would be there the first day to buy my favorite movie again.

325,m_essien05,Victim of itself,8,28 March 2006,"""Kevin Smith sold out at Mallrats"" claim uppity, hardcore underground American film lovers. Not true at all but this is not the basis of this review. Mallrats failed, certainly at the box office and with certain critics simply because it was not Clerks. It was an equally offbeat, bizarre rom-com that did not follow a set structure that most rom-coms do so now. Watch almost any romantic comedy for example Mr. Deeds or Bring It On. The plot lines are incredibly similar, if you watch closely enough and has lead to far too many simple, by numbers teen rom-coms being produced. Yet, this structure must have appeared from somewhere. This structure, this format was derived from Mallrats. And sadly many people see your traditional American rom-coms before they see Mallrats, Kevin Smith's sophomore effort becomes another flick adhering to said format rather than the originator of it. It has become a cult film true, but it is also a victim of itself.",Mallrats

We have a friend like every one of the characters in that movie. And my boyfriend just so happened to always have a problem with kids on escalators! For us, Kevin Smith is a genius! He relates to all of us who are ignored by every other movie writer. I love that I can watch this movie with my Mom, and she wouldn't get half the jokes. Kevin's movies have one liners that me and my friends use all the time. That's what makes a good movie! Snoogins!",Mallrats
