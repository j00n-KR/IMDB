0,ComedyFan2010,A positive movie,8,11 January 2019,"Is this movie very original? Not at all. It follows the common formula of such self confidence movies. But it is lovely executed and I ended up enjoying every minute of it. It is very charming and positive. Positive not just in the main message (love yourself and be who you want to be) but also in the execution and how nice the characters are. Nobody is hateful and negative to others (except for that guy in the beginning who got what he deserved). There are no nasty jury who need to be proven something, no nasty contestants trying to sabotage you, actually no mean mothers. The only person one needs to prove something to is oneself. The rest of the women and girls are very nice to each other, which is so wonderful. And this is something that was kind of special in this movie.Actors were also great. Jennifer Aniston is great at performing a loving mother who maybe has some misunderstandings with her daughter yet wants to do the best for her. Harold Perrineau is amazing. When I saw him first I had trouble to figure out who it is even though the face looked familiar. He is a great actor who is very different in every role I saw him.So if you want to see some very deep award receiving movie, this is probably not the one for you. But if you want an entertaining and positive movie that will make you feel good about life than this is a good choice.",Dumplin'
1,BandSAboutMovies,A cute movie,7,13 December 2018,"Based on the novel by Julie Murphy (you can see her in a cameo near the end of the film and she's recently written a book called Puddin' that follows the story of the supporting cast of this story) and directed by Anne Fletcher (who also directed Hot Pursuit, a movie we saw as the second feature at least five times at the drive-in throughout the summer of 2015) from a script by Kristin Hahn (who in her youth lived with star Jennifer Aniston and has a production company with her), Dumplin' hits home. The story of a teenage girl trying to understand how to fit in with a world she doesn't fit into who loves Dolly Parton may seem like the exact opposite of something that would reach me, but what you don't know is that I grew up in a small town with one country station that played nearly all day long playlists of Ms. Parton. And despite my collection of black shirts and a patch ridden jacket, I've proudly stood in the front row, singing out loud to every song at Dolly shows.Willowdean Dickson (Danielle Macdonald) was raised primarily by her Aunt Lucy while her mother Rosie (Aniston) relives her beauty queen past as a semi-celebrity in their small Texas hometown.After the sudden death of her aunt, Willowdean has to deal with pageant season, a time of the year that she finds ridiculous. She convinces her best friend and fellow Dolly fan Ellen Dryver (Odeya Rush, Goosebumps) to enter the Miss Teen Bluebonnet Pageant as a protest. Willowdean isn't the same body shape and size as her mother, so she's fiercely against the beauty contest and willing to defend others, like shy Millie Michalchuk, who ends up coming out of her shell. Joining them in their ""protest in heels"" is Hannah Perez (Bex Taylor-Klaus, Hell Fest, TV's The Killing), whose short hair looks and love of metal are in sharp contrast to every other girl.Miss Teen Bluebonnet will test Willowdean's friendship with Ellen, as well as strengthen her love of her lost aunt by meeting many of her drag queen friends, including Harold Perrineau from TV's Lost and Ru Paul's Drag Race contestant Ginger Minj. Willowdean also learns that even the cutest guy in school, Bo, might be able to see through society's views on beauty to see who she is inside.Sure, Dumplin' is sentimental and at times schmaltzy, but it's also a well-made and at times, pretty amusing film. It was also nice to see Kathy Najimy in the film (her husband Dan Finnerty is also in the movie as beauty contest host Eugene Reed). And who doesn't love hearing a soundtrack packed with Dolly tunes, including a new one that she wrote just for the movie?",Dumplin'
2,phd_travel,The fat joke wears thin,6,17 August 2019,"This is a movie about a fat coming to terms with her looks and finding love. Her thin Mom is played by Jennifer Aniston who is made up and dresses suitably like an ex Texas beauty queen but her accent isn't enough. The Dolly Parton theme could have been exploited better.The lead actress is okay but not that sweet. No Melissa McCarthy.
At first it's quite watchable. The I'm not worthy thing wears thin after a while. Same joke same angst same resolution.",Dumplin'
3,deloudelouvain,Not my thing even though the message is fine.,5,16 December 2018,"Dumplin' is another movie with a message. It's about giving big people a chance, about them being able to achieve anything, even a beauty pageant. Nothing new here as there was just a similar movie last year, Don't Talk To Irene, where it was about cheerleading and not a beauty pageant. I liked that movie better than this one if I have to be honest. Dumplin' has too much ingredients I'm just not a fan of, like Dolly Parton music, beauty pageants, and drag queens. It's a I-feel-bad-for-fat-people with a feel-good ending. We all got the message, everybody should have a chance doing whatever they want however they look. But let's face it, reality is totally different, as a bigger girl would never compete or have a chance to win in one of those superficial shows. Danielle Macdonald did a good job with her character, so for the acting it wasn't bad. It's just the movie that is just too boring for a fifty year old guy like me. It will probably do better with the female audience.",Dumplin'
4,ThomasDrufke,Diverts as Many Cliches as Possible,6,31 December 2018,"Let me start out by saying this film is definitely not my typical area of interest. A movie about someone trying to upend the routine of a yearly beauty pageant in order to prove a point to her judging mother, is not something I would usually check out. However, with Jennifer Aniston involvement as the aforementioned Mother, I felt it might be worth giving a shot. Luckily, the film makes every attempt to divert expectations and avoid cliches, but it forgets how to right a lead character that can be someone you care about. She's every bit as judging and critical as her mom is but to other people. Of course, that's the arc 'Dumplin' goes through as she navigates her own sort of coming of age story. It has sweet intentions, is executed well enough to be watched but perhaps not well enough to be acclaimed.6.5/10",Dumplin'
5,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,5,17 December 2018,"Dumplin'If you want to critic the way a woman's body looks become a beauty pageant judge.Unfortunately, the contestant in this comedy is adjudicated both on and off stage.Raised by her Dolly Parton obsessed grandmother, plus-sized teenager Dumplin' (Danielle Macdonald) is a big disappointment to her beauty queen mom, Rosie (Jennifer Aniston). So when her grandma dies, Dumplin' shows her resentment towards Rosie by entering the teen beauty pageant that she is judging. But in order to get her body-positive message across, Dumplin' needs some stage advise from her grandma's friend, a Dolly Parton impersonator (Harold Perrineau).Netflix's adaptation of the 2015 bestseller touches on some important social stigmas and features a toe-tapping Dolly laden soundtrack, however, the ham-fisted directing, low-production values and childish antics of the script diminish the message of inclusivity.Incidentally, now that there's diversity in beauty pageants we can finally see some hot 80-year-olds.

7,matthewssilverhammer,Aniston deserves so much better.,3,14 February 2019,"I think this is supposed to be a comedy of some sort, but a negative amount of funny things actually happen during its runtime. There's so much self-pity and so many tiresome tears, you nearly miss that the whole thing just plays like a super long ego trip for Dolly Parton. Featuring the least likable protagonist of 2018, each character acts in equal parts atrocious and nonsensical.",Dumplin'

13,apryla-58795,Love yourself kumbaya crap!,3,26 December 2018,"So now they're trying to make Danielle Macdonald happen? Why though? Just cause she's obese and Hollywood wants to be hypocrites? Like ""Oh America you need to accept all people especially obese ones even though we never would."" Puh-lease! No way would a guy like Luke Benward be interested in a girl like Danielle Macdonald in real life especially when someone who looks like Dove Cameron is practically throwing herself at him but we're just supposed to buy it for this?! No.This is a movie based on a book pry written by an overweight person who wanted to write a fantasy. It's not remotely close to reality. This isn't news. The world is one giant High School and nothing will ever change that...anyone who tries to tell you different or expects that they will be able to change that through pandering crap like this is selling you a bill of goods. I was overweight at one point in my life so I know what I'm talking about. Hollywood will continue to trot obese people out so they can be self congratulatory but they don't really care about those people nor do they really buy into what the message is in this movie. Obese people will get roles but no one ever takes them seriously. They are just being used by Hollywood for their own selfish reasons.Danielle Macdonald is not only obese - she's mannish. She has the extreme misfortune of being so big she has a hump of fat on her back. She has man calves and a pig like face. She also did that annoying thing most fat people do all the time throughout the movie which is constantly fiddle with their overly large T-shirt's by pulling them down repeatedly. Such a turn-off! She didn't even look good when she was fixed up in the end. So to use her as the lead was just a bad casting decision. They only cast her cause she's the charity flavor of the month so Hollywood can pat themselves on the back. Would've been more believable if Maddie Baillio had been Dumplin'. She at least had a beautiful face and a rockin' attitude. You could see a guy being drawn to her because she seemed fun to be around. Dumplin' was not just overweight she was kinda pathetic. It wouldn't have mattered if she was thin either because if you lack self-confidence and aren't very good looking that isn't attractive to anyone.All this feel good crap they try feeding you about accepting yourself and telling obese people they are beautiful and the rest of us are shallow if we don't hold these people up as sexy and perfect is stupid and I'm so over it. Being morbidly obese is only attractive to people with weird fetishes. We should NOT be glorifying obesity! Being obese is not attractive but it has little to do with outward appearance. If someone is grotesquely obese it means one thing - (having thyroid issues or specific health issues don't come into play here) they are lazy and lack self-control and those things aren't sexy.We should not be glorifying something that causes health problems and price hikes to health insurance for the rest of those who take pride in their appearance and health. I'm all for body positivity but when it crosses over into shaming people into glorifying individuals who don't make their health a priority that's where I draw the line. Why must they show that one group is better than everyone else when they aren't?Dumplin' was just NOT that interesting. Forget her weight - she was boring. She lived with shame but rather than do something about it she slunk around watching from the sidelines pathetically and then instead of being supportive of her supposed best friend she turns around and tries to make her feel bad for being naturally thin and pretty and good at the pageant stuff - the stuff she wishes she were good at but doesn't want to do the hard work to get to that point so instead she turns things around and basically has the attitude of ""if you can't glorify my obesity and general boringness well then YOU are the bad one here.""
So dumb!If you want to be respected and interesting then do something to deserve that! You don't automatically get a gold star for being fat and boring. So fed up with Hollywood portraying responsible thin and good looking people as terrible people - here's an idea - you can be all of those things and still be a good person. Just like you can be an obese ahole. Duh!Jennifer Anniston was good in parts. Odeya Rush is Mila Kunis! It throws you to see the alarming likeness between the two. Maddie Baillio was great in this. Now there's an example of someone who is obese but had self-confidence and wasn't boring. She was cute and fun and looked fun to be around. She refused to let her appearance define her but she wasn't all on her high horse about insisting people worship her for being fat. She just did her thing and if people liked it great but if not that was ok too. She wasn't judgey or boring.Bex Taylor-Klaus was ok. She overacted a bit but she was funny in parts.The actress who played the aunt reminded me of a thinner, prettier Chrissy Metz. In fact why didn't they just use Chrissy Metz? Why'd they need to find a different actress especially when she basically had no lines?Kathy Najimy was wasted in this. I loved the one shorter fatter drag queen. He was great.I would not recommend this because it's kind of insulting to everyone's intelligence.Bottom line you SHOULD love yourself IF you work hard to be healthy and you craft a personality and a career that are interesting and worthy. You should not expect accolades if you've done none of those things regardless of whether you are overweight or not.Also Americans are overweight as a whole. We are gluttonous and it's not a good look. Being healthy is just something that in general is accepted as a good idea and commendable and advisable by doctors. Why then must Hollywood continue to try to perpetuate this false myth that being obese is where it's at? It's irresponsible and fake especially because no one in Hollywood would be caught dead with an obese person unless it became fashionable. And the last time I checked it's never been fashionable and it never will because it shouldn't be held up as being that way. Neither should shaming people who live healthy lifestyles who happen to be genetically blessed.I'm over this crap and you should be too!",Dumplin'
14,joelwatchesmovies,A touching character study with a bevy of feel-good moments,7,10 December 2018,"There's not a lot of tension or even momentum to be found in the plot (the revolution meets surprisingly few external obstacles, and conflicts with mom or friend appear and disappear) but that's because at its core it's simply a story about Willowdean (Macdonald is great) and her touching journey through grief and self-acceptance, and gosh, it has so many beautiful moments (the underdogs performing at the pageant was wonderful of course, but I'm pretty sure heaven will be like that Dolly show).",Dumplin'
15,dansview,PC Tornado,5,3 January 2019,"This one managed to represent: The Overweight, Hispanics, African Americans, Gays, Lesbians, Drag Queens, Single Moms, Working Class People, and a bullying theme.
There is only one verbal explanation for the Dolly Parton obsession and it was totally incomprehensible. Meanwhile they only play her hits from what I could hear.
The heavy-set lead never goes on a diet or exercises. Not that one must, but since her weight obviously troubled her, she should have considered it, or someone else should have suggested it.
At first I thought it was going to be a protest of beauty pageants like Little Miss Sunshine. But I think it actually gave pageants some respect toward the end. Because the former protestors seem to have embraced the process without mocking it.
I think it's possible for popular boys to go for heavy girls, but not very likely.
Jennifer Anniston actually did a decent job here as a woman who takes pride in her accomplishment and the pageant institution as it relates to womanhood and the State of Texas. She doesn't want to disrespect her daughter, but it works both ways. Her daughter has zero respect for her mom's passion. Sometimes this is just the way things are.
The ""drag queen"" thing was just too-over-the-top. Why would these young Texas girls think it's just so wonderful? Because the lead's aunt frequented a drag bar?The female friendship between a thin girl and a heavy one was depicted nicely, and the interaction with a decent male coworker was refreshing, if not believable.But like with Coyote Ugly and so many other underdog pictures, the makers don't know when to lay off the cheese. There's always a huge portion at the end. I walked away, but I'm a guy.",Dumplin'
16,SafReviews,Decent movie that gave out a good message!,7,14 January 2019,"I only watched this movie because Jennifer Aniston was in it and it was alright. The plot was good, however it could've been a bit better and realistic; for example, i felt like the former beauty pageant could've been more tougher on her overweight daughter by encouraging her to lose weight for example. Other than that the movie was intriguing throughout and there were a few funny moments, but i think there should've been more. One thing i liked about the movie that it didn't slam and criticise 'healthy people' or portray them as villains like most movies, tv shows, music videos etc do. I also felt Jennifer Aniston portrayed her character well, but i wish she had more lines and screen time.",Dumplin'

19,n-kefala,Beauty,7,1 June 2019,"Brilliantly adapted by Kristen Hahn and directed by Anne Fletcher, ""Dumplin'"" will inspire any woman of any age to love who they are. The movie it is open to the idea that beauty itself is more expansive and subjective and has nailed the idea of self-love better than we've seen on-screen before. The truth is that it doesn't completely avoid some common pitfalls of a book-to-screen adaptation, but it is a fun movie about female friendship and self-acceptance. Will mean a lot to a lot of young women who struggle to see themselves in TV and movies, and this feel-good comedy reminds them that they're beautiful just the way they are...""Dumplin'"" is a film well worth your time.

The acting is very good by the entire star-cast - especially Jennifer Aniston and Danielle Macdonald.The direction is excellent - the main message has been conveyed so easily and effortlessly by the director of the movie.

Well acted but overly sentimental...,7,22 December 2018,"This is a fun movie, with terrific performances from the lead cast especially Jennifer Aniston and Danielle Macdonald. However the script is overly sentimental and the direction pedestrian at best. I felt that I'd seen it before as it had a ""Kinky Boots"" feel to it and the film played out long. It could've used some editing. It has a very ""American"" feel to it, but the Dolly Parton connection was fun and her music was well used.",Dumplin'
24,zack_gideon,Feel Good Movie of the Year,9,8 December 2018,"Not a Dolly Parton fan and wasn't familiar with the book, but this movie is just happy and uplifting.

25,stefstars,It's cute,5,14 September 2019,"I didn't have high expectations for it, to be fair. I liked how it started where we learn about the main character's relationship to her aunt and how her aunt was more motherly than her actual mother. As the movie progresses, I become less fond of the main character.
I didn't like the mother from the start (Jennifer Aniston's character) but I was rooting for the main protagonist until her true, shallow colors were shown during the pageant segment of the movie.I get that the main character feels less than because of her weight and how she's treated because of it, but she's rude to the other outsiders in the story. I started rooting for the other plus sized girl instead of the protagonist, I liked her character a lot better. All in all, I still enjoyed it. I liked the whole Dolly Parton theme it had going on, I wish we had more flashbacks to the protagonist's upbringing with the aunt. I never read the book so I'm not sure if the protagonist acts the way she does in the movie in the original version as well. However, I imagine the book explains why she begins lashing out that way, whereas the way it was executed in the film - it just came out of the blue, which is why she becomes less likeable.It's a cute film and it is quite a ""feel good movie"" nonetheless. It has it's heart warming and fun moments. I recommend it if you're looking for just that, a ""feel good movie.""",Dumplin'

If I'm to be honest, I feel Jennifer Annison has lost her way a little since Friends and yet she is absolutely spot on in this movie. She points the humour and yet still shows her disapproval of what her daughter has become.

Willowdean Dixon rebels against her aging pageant queen mother, Rosie (Jennifer Anniston), by entering the very pageant her mother holds so dearly. She intends to make a mockery of the contest, rather than win in defiance of the way of life it encourages. Her motives seem based on teenage angst and shortsightedness, rather than any sort of social activism or desire for change. This is entirely valid and realistic and makes the film more tangible and plausible, as this is absolutely how a teenager in this situation would behave. When Millie and Hannah, also outcasts for weight and fashion reasons respectively, also join the pageant, Will is vehemently opposed, seeing this as a violation of her quest to get back at her mother. The actual content of the plot is predictable and not particularly exciting or enticing, and the gratification at the end is shallow and superficial, though minimally satisfying.",Dumplin'

I felt this film was mostly flat and clichéd. I'm trying to think of a redeeming feature, but no, nothing. It was a real struggle getting through this. Basically the story is: a fat girl feels good about herself by going to a beauty pageant. Add all the appropriate cliches (gay person that helps with dancing and clothing; girly friendships; tension with mother) and any 13 year old girl could have completed the script. I guess maybe a young girl would like it, but even then I'm sure they would recognise it is preditable and clichéd. Really, just an awful film.",Dumplin'

Directed by Anne Fletcher and written by Kristin Hahn and Julie MurphyThis is not normally my bag of tea. I like cynical movies. I like movies that some might call depressing. This movie is not that, not that at all. I'm also one hundred percent not the normal audience for this type of movie. But it's always good to expand your horizons and see new things. This was a recommendation from my fiancee.At first this movie left me a tiny bit cold. I was seeing the surface story which has a bunch of little tethers around the edges. It shows just tiny pieces of her life as she chooses to go into this pageant. The pageant is the only thing that Willowdean's mother has. She neglected the relationship she had with her daughter all those years to focus exclusively on this. This left Willowdean in the care of her aunt. The aunt has recently passed on and now this leaves a hole in Willowdean's life. What does she do going forward? She finds an application to the pageant by the aunt and this gives her the idea to enter herself. This act of courage inspires others to follow in her footsteps.You would think this is where the mean girls and bullies would step in. But strangely enough this movie doesn't follow down that path. It is all the better for it. It subverts the easy path. What bothered me at first but I came to understand why the movie went this way is the relationship between Willowdean and her best friend and Willowdean and the love interest. Both of them are surface level and only there to really show another side of her. They're window dressing and that's okay to this story. This story is about loss and grief. The loss of her aunt really changes her world. Her aunt is felt in this pageant and Willowdean's love of the music of Dolly Parton. The aunt's spirit is everywhere and it permeates all the decisions she makes and why she makes them. Just for another chance to feel a little closer to her.You are also surprised by Jennifer Aniston and her character. You think she is one thing but this is not the case. She is way more human despite her obsession with the pageant. Performances in this film are frankly astonishing. Everyone is so good and you feel all the emotions roiling through everyone. You know their motivations and even if you think you know where this is going, you really don't. I give this movie a B.",Dumplin'
43,bef1991,Disappointed,5,7 December 2018,There was such hype about this movie and I love both Jennifer Aniston and Dolly Parton but I was so let down. The dialogue was very bland. I expected the story to be predictable but was hoping the actor's lines would inject life into it but sadly it didn't. Frankly the best part of the movie was Dolly Parton's music and little else.,Dumplin'
44,mossow92,"your basic feel-good movie with good music and a good message. No harm at all, but really leaves no lasting impression on the viewer.",7,13 January 2019,"Another case of the trailer of a movie basically giving away the film here. The film plays out from the beginning with the basic love large people premise and basically paints by numbers from there on. On the positive side, you get all the hits of the Dolly catalog and all the actors play their parts well. While it's Willa's story, at certain times I found her hard to believe her motivations behind her actions, and I favored the supporting characters to her. The conflicts in the plot are solved too easily. Jennifer Aniston does what she can with what she is given, but her performance seems pretty safe and standard fare that she can do with her eyes closed. It's just your basic feel-good movie with good music and a good message. No harm at all, but really leaves no lasting impression on the viewer.",Dumplin'
45,StrayFeral,Amusing,7,27 December 2018,"Generally: Amusing
Plot: Messed-up family, daughter tries to get mom's attention
Best thing: Tries to make a point and send a message (not very well)
Worst thing: Way way way toooo much Dolly PartonApparently Netflix started doing not just series, but also single movies. I got confused at first, thought it would be a pilot episode of a new show, but not. Spent time watching it. Generally it is very amusing, you won't feel disappointed if you spend the time. Bad thing is, it implements damn way too much of Dolly Parton. Don't get me wrong, country music fan here too, but the use of Dolly's name is way too much. Using Dolly's music is completely fine for me.The movie tries to make a point and send the message that every body is okay (the main character is overweight). However this part of the movie is a bit weak and messes up with the main point of the story - the entire story actually goes around the main character, trying to get her mom's attention and respect. That's it, no more or less. How she tries to send the message is not well done.Acting is okay, no comments here. But the path to the glam is not well shown, maybe because at first the nerd girls club tries to sabotage the beauty contest, before later they decide to actually do it.What would have been done better: (1) Showing more funny moments of how the girls prepare for the contest, more floppy walking on heels, makeup-drama, trying more clothes etc. (2) Since the actual story is the main character trying to win her mom's attention and respect, I would like to see more of her inner drama and her efforts revealed.",Dumplin'

Somebody wrote here that it's cliched , well. if a movie about learning to love yourself and see perfection in the imperfections of others is a cliche then sign me up.
You will need at least one box of Kleenex to watch this movie because you will be crying with joy and sadness ( only in one or two places ) throughout most of the movie.
If you love Dolly Parton then that's a major plus here... but even if you don't... her music is so fitting to the general atmosphere and essential to the plot that you'll find yourself falling in love with Dolly too .

We don't get to see the mother-daughter conflict from both sides. Willowdean keeps telling us that her mom doesn't like/love her because she didn't turn out the way her mom wanted but, that is not what we see.I did enjoy the drag queens and the Dolly Parton.

55,courtneypedersen,Very Enjoyable Movie,8,11 January 2019,"I actually decided to read the book before watching the movie because, more often than not, the book is better. Dumplin' is no exception but the movie came very close to being just as good as the book. The scenes revolving around the pageant came pretty close to what happened in the book and I really liked that they even used some of the conversations from the book itself. I thought they choose the perfect actors and actresses for the roles and found myself laughing quite a bit during the movie. The only part that I was disappointed in were the scenes with Bo and Willowdean. Don't get me wrong, I think they were able to capture the essence of that relationship but I would have liked to have seen more of what happened in the book, play out in the movie. I feel like her relationship with Bo in the book not only showed her how insecure she truly was but it also helped her get her confidence back. I really feel like they could have done more with that part of the story and I wouldn't have minded seeing Mitch in the movie either. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and have watched it a few times now. If you liked the book, definitely give the movie a shot. It was a joy to see those characters come to life.",Dumplin'

58,mickgmovies,Feel good for all the right reasons,8,11 December 2018,"What a lovely unexpected watch this was.
Set in conservative Texas, the movie gracefully and gleefully challenges all the stereotypes and beliefs that still hold strong in large parts of the world.
Beliefs based on body image, sexual preference and having to fit in. More importantly it challenges self beliefs - and shows how believing and loving yourself makes all the difference.
Jennifer Anniston and Danielle Macdonald (and in fact the entire cast) give great performances - and you can only but smile at the end.
This is the movie Pitch Perfect should've been - if it had the humility and intelligence of this film.
A lovely, lovely film.

The plot revolves around a teenager whose mom was too busy for her, so her beloved Aunt showed her how to love herself & stay committed to her inner self. Dolly Parton was their mutual idol, so prepare for a Dolly track which was enjoyable also.
As the body positive teen enters her mother's beloved beauty pageant, she goes to a place where her aunt was loved & truly missed after she passed away. A cowboy bar with a Dolly Parton Drag show. Of course!

I don't find Willowdean as likeable or as pretty as Millie the other big girl in the story and would find it more believable if Bo liked Millie.
It is nice that the skinny girls are not mean to her in the pageant and for once that type of girl is not portrayed as mean.

The conversations are realistic, the characters are likeable and relatable. No one is purely the good guy or bad guy, it's a healthy dose of the realization that no one is fully understood or appreciated in this little community until they open their hearts and see each other more clearly. Jennifer Anniston grows on you (I""m from the south so hearing her southern accent is jarring and distracting and she holds her mouth in an awkward way when she does it), all of the girls are beautiful and tapestry characters. The main actress who plays Dumplin' is superb. You can see the emotions behind her tough exterior and she has some beautiful moments.

68,Warren-Watched-A-Movie,A great adaption of the young adult novel,8,23 September 2020,"Jennifer Aniston was convincing as single mother Rosie Dickson who is still stuck in the accomplishments of her past. Whether intentional or not Rosie's daughter is left with the impression that in her mother's eyes she does not quite measure up. I was left with the impression though that from the perspective of Aniston's character she was just trying to protect her daughter but that was not what the daughter was understanding. She assumed her mother was ashamed when she was just wrapped up in her world and maybe at times emotionally neglectful.The dynamic between the Will and Rosie felt real. Too often I will see an actress up on screen and she will have the obligatory child in the story but her moments with the child do not feel real. It is as if the actress has no idea how to connect with this young actor in front of them. I am thinking specifically of Ashley Judd in Double Jeopardy here. It is a good movie that falls apart when Judd must interact with the actor playing her child. She looked uncomfortable. Aniston came off as natural and quite comfortable. I give her credit for that.Danielle Macdonald does an amazing job. She gets you to invest in the character. I felt bad for Will as she was struggling with self-image problems and her relationship with Rosie that both had been avoiding dealing with while her aunt who recently passed was alive. The aunt was a surrogate mother to Willowdean and now that she didn't have that relationship to hide in she had to actually deal with the problems in their relationship.One perpetual thorn is that all of Will's friends call her ""Will"" with only her mother using ""Dumplin'."" I can empathize with this as I had a childhood nickname that my parents used in front of everyone wherever we went, and it was always quite embarrassing. Macdonald's reaction as the character was authentic. Will also deals with feelings of inadequacy when it comes to workplace hunk Bo (Luke Benward) who is clearly interested in her but she cannot understand why.Willowdean and Rosie must also confront their feelings over the loss of Rosie's sister. She was the glue that apparently held everything together and her loss is exposing old wounds. This movie does a good job at exploring the void that the death of a loved one can create in a family.This is all set to an obsession Will and her late aunt had with the singer Dolly Parton which is shared to an extent by Will's best friend. It is a sweet and quirky little connection that is played very effectively and provides for a great soundtrack but then you really cannot go wrong with Dolly. Fitting in with the Dolly theme in this movie is a drag biker bar that was an important part of the life of Will's Aunt Lucy (Hilliary Begley).The movie is about the assorted characters coming into their own. They are either being who they truly are or coming to terms with emotional baggage. Will is finally confronting apparent resentment she never realized she felt towards her best friend Elle (Odeya Rush). Meek Millie Mitchellchuck (Maddie Baillio) is inspired by Will to finally pursue her dream she had since she was eight years old and enter the pageant despite feeling that her weight was a hindrance as well as stand up to her overprotective mother (Kathy Najimy). Hannah Perez (Bex Taylor-Klaus) gets to just be herself in front of the world. I felt her part was the least developed. Too often she was just the sarcastic friend.Dumplin' is done in such a touching way here. Normally these types of films can get overly saccharine or overly downbeat but neither happens here. You feel the character highs and lows, but it is never downbeat nor is the film a knock-on parents or families or institutions. It is merely the story of a young woman and those around her and the growth they go through during a certain period.The best part is they do not go for the obvious ending. Too often it is eyerolling and totally unrealistic. Dumplin' does not win the pageant, but she is still victorious in her own way by bridging the divide with her mother and finally willing to believe it can work with Bo along with making amends with Elle.There is a word that got tossed around quite a lot a few years back, but I have not heard it used too much recently. It is dramedy. That is what this movie is. It is a drama with plenty of comedic elements. It is serious but the seriousness is balanced out by lighthearted moments. You will laugh and it will tug at your emotions.Dumplin' is a very enjoyable heartwarming film adaption of the young adult novel of the same name. It has a great script with plenty of jokes and a significant amount of heart. If you get a chance you should watch this.",Dumplin'

It really is a cute movie there's no other way to describe it. It does have some flaws, but it was mostly just a really sweet movie with a lot of heart. I even cried a couple of times!I love small town settings. This movie gave me Sweet Home Alabama & Steal Magnolias vibes, although not as good as either.Love that they tackle beauty pageants and how beauty is judged. Although there were a few times I was left wanting more.I loved the performances by Jennifer Aniston, Odeya Rush, and the drag queens mostly because they were so unexpected!So this movie had a little bit of everything. Pagents in Texas, overweight daughter of the ""Queen of Pageants"" Mother, friendships new and old, Drag Queens, Dolly Parton..whew! I don't even think that's everything.Anyway, I loved the characters for the most part l, but none of them ever seemed fully developed, which made it hard to connect to any of them. I think that's why I liked Rush's performance. Her character really showed a believable amount of vulnerability and at the same time was charming. I just think that's pretty real especially when it comes to teenage girls.The lead character played by Macdonald was far less likable to me. I kept wanting her to do something to make me want to root for her but the moment never really came. Of course, it was never about her actually winning the pageant though.The other part that bugged me about Dumplin' was that we never had a reason why Bo wanted to date her so bad. Again, I'm fine with rooting for her but there was no character development with her.Everything else is fine and the movie is definitely watchable and likable. I just wish they gave more to the lead character. I feel like they managed to do it with Elle, by the middle of the movie. In fact, I was rooting for Elle to win or Millie (she was a joy) but I didn't know how to feel about Dumplin' and she was th protagonist.The other minor issue I had with the cast was Hannah. Don't get me wrong, the actress is great, but she deserved a better storyline. There were far too many cheesy montage scenes that included her and sometimes it appeared forced. Also she gave a couple of cring-worthy scenes. One was during the talent show auditions and the other was her bathing suit. This again is not the fault of the actress, she's awesome, but the writers could've been more creative.Even with those flaws, it's still a really cute and simple film. I recommend it and would definitely watch again.",Dumplin'

Walking around on stage in skimpy outfits while a room full of strangers judges you primarily on appearance is not my idea of fun. However, if some people really do enjoy participating in them, and they are not put under pressure to make health threatening decisions in order to achieve standardised ""best looks,"" then I say go for it.It's no question that pageants are too strict on what is defined as the ultimate beauty standard, but this is born out of the fact that beauty is itself subjective, not objective, and cannot be measured by categorised metrics. The film, I guess, tries to address this, but does so by going completely off the deep end. Yes, we should be questioning pre-conceived attractiveness, but to do it by glorifying a hugely unhealthy lifestyle? I understand choosing a protagonist who is curvy but both the main actress and one of the supporting actresses are clearly obese. We're not talking a little chubby, we're talking heart problems at 30. The film briefly touches on this point in relation to one of the characters, but it is brushed aside almost without comment.I'm really getting tired of this whole 'fat acceptance' movement. No, it is not a healthy or sustainable lifestyle to lead. No, your genetics do not stop you from being a healthy weight. No, you do not know better than your doctors. You can look it up in any medical journal you like, or even look at the statistics themselves if you want, but they will all tell you the same story - being overweight will increase your likelihood of health problems.

83,pronoun36,A Stale Dumplin,4,15 March 2019,"Dumplin is a Netflix original that stars Danielle MacDonald as Willowdean Dickson. After the passing of her aunt, Willow decides to enter a local beauty pageant ran by her own mother, played by Jennifer Anniston. Due to her heavy stature, Willowdeen hopes to start a revolution against the pageant and prove how foolish it is to her mother, who won the pageant herself in the past. From this general synopsis, you can probably gather that the film focuses on the relationship between MacDonald and Anniston. After all, the two play both mother and daughter and arch rivals. Unfortunately, the film is not as devoted to this relationship as it is to other cliches you would expect with this kind of story. Most of Dumplin's runtime focuses on Willow's relationship with her fellow pageant contestants as well as a romantic relationship with a boy she works with. I wouldn't mind these angles if the story offered anything original or captivating, which it doesn't. These plot lines are incredibly predictable and offer nothing that we haven't seen before. This makes the film feel more like a tired romantic comedy than a story of a daughter standing up to her mother. Dumplin is an interesting film to review because I feel there is a stronger movie within this script that was never allowed to surface. However, I can only identify mere traces of Dumplin's potential in the final product. As an example, all of the actors give very believable performances. This is one of Jennifer Anniston's best performances in film and her scenes with MacDonald carry a lot of dramatic weight. Maddie Baillio also does a great job for her relatively smaller role in the film. Nevertheless, she was charming to watch and created a very likable character. I also admire that this picture does not paint Willowdean as a victim. As the film progresses, she realizes that even if she wants to resist the pageant, she still has to play by its rules. This is a very unique and profound message that isn't tackled often in film. Dumplin is not an awful picture, but it isn't good either. I really wanted this film to be recommendable by the end of the review. If the filmmakers focused more on the core relationship between Willowdean and her mother, I think the film would have been a lot stronger. Alas, this was not the case. Though Dumplin is not a terrible movie, it is certainly not good and disappointing overall.",Dumplin'

94,ventery,A Beautiful Portrayal of Beauty,9,23 December 2019,"I have wanted to see Dumplin' from the first moment I watched the trailer a year ago and now, I finally had the chance to see it and it blew me away. As a plus sized woman in her early 30's, I found the film very moving and beautiful, not because it features a plus sized girl entering a beauty pageant but because of the story beneath the story. But I'm getting ahead of myself here.To start, the choice of acting talent in this film could have been better. Danielle MacDonald was not very likeable as the main character Willowdean, however, she did a fair job at portraying the inner struggles her character was going through.On the contrary, Jennifer Aniston did a fantastic job as the mother, Rosie. She managed to bring an edge of coldness to her unsupportive attitude toward her on-screen daughters' decision to take part in the beauty pageant and then captured every mother and daughter's heart when she finally realised how strong and beautiful her daughter is.Furthermore, the underlying themes were beautifully incorporated but you have to really pay attention to notice them. One prominent theme was Dumplin's struggle with overcoming her own insecurities about her weight and beauty. What really touched me was her back and forth conflict with herself and those around her as she slowly realised that she is great just the way she is. Having gone through similar experiences as an overweight teen, I empathize with her and was deeply moved by her transformation.All in all, I really enjoyed Dumplin' and would recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a film about friendship, love and self-acceptance.",Dumplin'

97,Jo-Ropke,Dump this movie...,1,16 April 2019,"I saw this movie while on an airplane for 9 hours. Otherwise I would not think about spending valuable time on this kind of predictable stuff. Besides all the other comments you can read here, there was 1 thing that struck me the most: it was the lack of real physical emotion between the mother and her daughter. There's this one scene in which a normal parent would not recite these typical Hollywood flawless sentences but would just close your kid in your arms and hug it firmly. No words necessary. A same scene comes to mind actually in another movie where the son has come out as gay (Love, Simon) and there is again this weird, rational dialogue between mother and son, where the mother tells her son how much she loves him... but, well, she just tells him, sitting across from him in the living room. No physical emotion whatsoever. All the time I was thinking: Come on, just give him a hug, give him a kiss... These so called heart warming movies with messages of love and understanding and acceptance... there all just fake crap. Nothing realistic. At least not the kind of reality I want to live in, or create for my kids.",Dumplin'

108,lasreviews,A feel-good movie that genuinely touched me,8,23 September 2019,"Willowdeanson is a larger sized Texas teen who has a girl crush on all things Dolly Partin and who lives in the shadow of her pageant winning mother, Rosie, former Miss Bluebonnet. She's been pretty much raised by her Aunt Lucy, a fun-loving but obese woman who teaches Will how to love, laugh and fangirl over Dolly Partin. Sadly, as the movie begins, her Aunt Lucy has passed away, leaving Willowdean one more thing to weigh her down.On the outside, Willowdean (aka Will or, aka the unfortunate nickname her mama gave her, Dumplin') seems confident and well adjusted, but things happen which make it clear that's not true. When the ""hot boy"" at work shows interest in her, she doesn't believe he's genuine. When her mama calls her Dumplin' in front of the entire school, unsurprisingly it leads to bullying from kids at school. The final straw is listening to her mom getting ready to co-host the upcoming pageant and all but ignoring Will. As a protest, and because she stumbles across some items from Aunt Lucy's things that inspire her, she signs up for the pageant. So does her best friend, Ellen, as well as another large and insanely upbeat girl from school, Millie (who is my favorite character in this movie) and an emo/goth feminist named Hannah.With a little help from from drag queen friends of her late aunt, these unlikely candidates prepare for the pageant.I won't give any more of the story away, but while it might be a bit predictable and clichéd and occasionally cheesy, it's fun and it's sweet and it makes a heart happy. It's not something I'd watch over and over again, but it was so touching and adorable. I loved the character development in Will and Hannah in particular, but also Rosie. Rosie never meant to make her Dumplin' feel poorly, she just got wrapped up in other things.I admit, I cried a tear or two... yes, I'm a crier at movies, it's true. But it genuinely touched me. This movie is worth a watch. Here's the trailer, if you're interested in a peek:",Dumplin'

I lived most of my adult life, in Louisiana and Texas and the accent was a bit much. Over all, the movie was great. It portrayed of how slim, sexy skinny girls have it better off in beauty pageants, and often-times get judged. Her acting was on par though!!! Whomever played the girl named Dumplin did a fabulous job!!! I loved the setting of people judging heavier set girls, and what they have to deal with in real-life. My mother was an extremely large woman and we often got picked on cause our mother was ""FAT"". This is an excellent example of how NOT to Body shame!!! I loved that there was some what of a chick flick feel to the movie, as well.

I really, thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I think anyone who appreciates a well-rounded, well-acted, heartwarming and bottomline human story, will enjoy this.
Furthermore, Danielle Macdonald (the actress who plays ""Dumplin'), was absolutely fantastic in this, as well as Jennifer Aniston who I think has really come into her own and found her comfort zone when it comes to acting - she seems to just easily play ""right,"" if that makes sense. And lastly, the music throughout was such a delight - Dolly Parton is an amazing talent and this movie makes you appreciate that and her, so much more. Just wonderful.",Dumplin'

But, um, what up with the fake southern accents? I live in Texas, I have lived in Texas my entire life, from experience I can tell you we do not have southern accents, even fake ones. So that part of the movie confused me, and felt very culturally inaccurate. Maybe some research could have been done in the accent department. Also never knew what a drag queen was before this movie... I think Millie was the best character in the movie.",Dumplin'
116,AnonymousMovieCritic,Not Worth Watching,2,12 December 2018,"This film had some cute, endearing scenes, but for the most part was painful to watch. It had a typical liberal message to force down the audience's throats. This message was about fat acceptance. Problem with the FA movement is that being overweight is not something to celebrate or accept.Truth is, there are deadly risks associated with being morbidly obese. My neighbor, who weighs 400 lbs and is diabetic, is currently in the hospital having her leg amputated. This is not something to aspire to.It would have been a better film had the obese stars gone on a diet and exercise program to lose the weight for the pageant rather than defiantly keeping themselves fat.Add to this PC theme were the Dolly Parton songs playing constantly.

126,EndeavoursGirl,Ugh,5,21 April 2019,"If you're looking for something light... like REAL LITE. Go for this one. LITE script. LITE acting. LITE EVERYTHING.
After 30 min I started trying to fast forward it. I haven't read the book, perhaps it is better? The plot makes no sense, lots of things come out of left field which made me go huh or ugh regularly.
Jennifer Aniston is basically playing her famous Rachel but a grown-up Texan version. The lead Willowdean, is wayyyyyy older in real life than the 16-17 she is supposed to play. Same with Bo. WAAAAYYYYY older. Almost to the point of Ugh (again)... No 16 year old would date a man. Yes, a grown man. No backstory to this sudden, romantic relationship. And no reason.
No character development. BTW the plot about Willowdean becoming a Dolly Parton meets magician was beyond comical. As in how ... where... why?!?!! And the drag queens? Where did they come from? (The To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything Julie Newmar movie?) All of this was somehow hidden in her beloved Aunt's life, who was basically her mother?
I kept waiting for Jennifer Aniston to say, sorry I'm not really your mom, it was your aunt.
Who died? But it was never explained.
Her dad? No show... not even mentioned. Actually... no other family mentioned at all in a small town? Really bizarre.
Netflix... you've got the money, you can get the talent, make it look really good... but the plot and writing was really really weak.
This movie is for pre-teens... or as I said real LITE viewing. Like comparing Club Soda to Coca Cola... (still waiting for my Coke).",Dumplin'

As an admirer of Dolly Parton, I do appreciate the music and how they use it to bring confidence and joy to the becoming-of-age characters.

136,orale_kapow,Feel Good With Sincerity Minus the Bashing,9,13 December 2018,"I loved this movie. I went into it expecting another reductive ""self esteem"" production like ""Insatiable."" I was SO surprised.Although the film does employ cliched thematic devices, I appreciate that it espoused soft ideas of female empowerment without ever disparaging things that one would consider ""un-feminist."" It didn't in any way attempt to be preachy.The entire film revolved around Will's participation in the pageant, yet the film is careful to never ever take the ""pageants are bad for women"" ideology. While they allow certain characters, like Hannah, to play the part of ""down with the patriarchy,"" the film provided room for characters like MIllie to be validated for their love of pageantry. The film let us know that her love of pageantry wasn't misguided or rooted in a desire to fit in. She wasn't portrayed as ""falling in line"" and was instead praised for her accomplishment in whatever dreams she had. Participating in the pageant and taking it seriously wasn't frowned upon in the end. It instead served to bring the four main girls together - it was a chance for them to be utterly themselves and enjoy an event that was formerly considered to be only for quintessential beauty queens.I also appreciated the love story between Will and Bo. It wasn't based on him ""seeing something different."" He genuinely liked Will for her whit, attitude, beauty and zest for life. Things that attract us to someone in our own lives. Instead of portraying him as this white knight character whose job it was to convince the girl she is beautiful, he says his piece and rightfully calls her out for her cowardice. He confronted her insecurity without trying to baby her. It made their (admittedly) convenient romantic narrative that much more enjoyable.A few other highlights for me:
1. I love how Dolly Parton was a unifying factor between all of the characters. This was evident in how Will interacted with the drag queens at the club. The film manages to avoid fetishizing Lee and Co. and instead connects them based on Dolly. It was a sweet way to interject the club members into the narrative without making them the butt of the joke.
2. I love their portrayal of Hannah. She was allowed to be queer without having to make a big deal about it or typecast her as the ""lesbian"" character. She was wholly herself and I appreciated it when she was shown to be walking out with another woman during the gown portion. It wasn't highlighted as some magical thing - rather it was normalized. This is Hannah and she is as much a part of the event as any other heterosexual couples there.
3. I liked that Will gave the brooch to her mother. It was a beautiful gesture. Instead of keeping it for herself, she gave it to her mother who only had fragments of memories of her sister. Will had concrete memories and bonding moments, so to give her mother the brooch was a great way to both encourage and remind her mother of her bond with her sister Lucy.All in all: great film. Doesn't aspire to higher soap-box messages about inequality or gender politics or deep messages about self-worth. It accepts the ordinary nature of its characters and uses it to weave something lovable and endearing.",Dumplin'
137,braulio09,Pandering and boring,1,22 February 2019,"This is a film about a girl whose only defining trait is that she is fat. The character is an apathetic, boring girl who never tries hard at anything she does and tries to spoil the fun for her friends that do. The other fat girl, Millicent was much nicer and I wanted to see her succeed. Truly, almost every character is more intereting than the lead.As another review said, we are told the whole movie that Dumplin's mom hates her but this is never shown or even hinted at. The only times Jennifer Aniston and Willowdean have any conflict is when the latter is not trying and expecting a hand out from her mom, the judge.I hope the original material is better. As it stands, this films haste awful message that trying is too hard.Really disappointed that this film gets so many 10/10s because the reviewers relate to the character.

155,mightyzewski,Didn't love the characters,5,25 January 2019,I don't think the characters were built enough. I didn't love any of them. It seemed like they cut out parts of their personalities. Willowdean honestly comes off like a bratty teen with no respect. A lot of the conflict between her and her mom seems more her throwing a teenage fit and things she is building up in her head. It seems like they may have left something out there.The whole Dolly Parton thing is really forced. And I get the pint of the movie and the theme but is really shoved down your throat in this. There is more point than story.I really hate movies that make all the adults and parents look like the idiots and all the kids and teens are the smarty pants know it alls and teach the grown ups a lesson.

We live in a world that brings all women down regarding their looks and especially size to buy into the multi billion dollar beauty market. This movie is heartwarming and touching and shows that women are BEAUTIFUL, GRACEFUL, COURAGEOUS and WORTHY no matter their size and that should stop surprising people!

It's so fun that she views herself as an outcast and becomes friends with the very people SHE viewed as more outcasted than her.Jennifer Aniston did a FABULOUS job being a country momma. You could see her flaws and mistakes, but you gotta love her anyways!!!My FAVORITE part, however, were the drag queens!!!

Plain and chubby teenager Willowdean grows up in the shadow of her beautiful mother (Jennifer Aniston) a former beauty queen still involved in local pagents. Her mother is always busy and she finds comfort in the unconditional love from her bubbly & kind Aunt and her best friend and their mutual love for Dolly Parton. But when Willowdean experiences loss, she must triumph for her beloved aunt's memory with help from her best friend and 2 unlikely new friends plus gets mothered by her aunt's Dolly Parton drag queen friends! Acting was great, music was fun. Aniston was funny, and showed a little humanity and growth as a character. Loved all the teen girls-the ""misfits"". Movie was relatively clean and refreshing!

If you're looking for warm and fuzzy feelings mixed with some sass and charm I recommend this movie. My belly didn't ache from laughing, but my mouth did hurt from smiling so much.

It doesn't make you unique or interesting when you're fat, it's just extra fat and yes its bad for you but I'm not getting into that. Proud to say I made it through countless eye rolls to the end so I could write this. If you want a good ""raw raw you go girl"" type of movie sure this is definitely it, but that's about it.

A product of the cringe-worthy and predictable writing.

She had a negative attitude most of the time, often judged people (super hypocritical) and was just feeling sorry for herself throughout the film, living in pity, didn't try improving her flaws (her whole personality really) and was just like i am who i am... and she blames everything on being big which was rarely the case.
I preferred her best friend and some of the other characters like Millie, and even her mother. Willowdean kept getting away with hurting peoples feelings, She's told hurtful things throughout the film as well but that's no excuse to do the same to others. I understand this film was about her learning to loveherself but i felt that you can't do that until you treat those around you better.",Dumplin'

But, even though everything start as an act of rebellion, and with irony, they end up being sucked by the narcissism of looking pretty, having shiny dresses and showing off some ridiculous talent.
The movie per se seems not to question pageants, and end up glorifying them as if they are a good thing for girls and their self esteem.It perpetuates the myth that all girls and women, no mater how they look, their sexual orientation, how ""woke"" they are or even what their political views are, we all want to be pretty, on display, and beauty queens.",Dumplin'

Well, Julie, I cried the entire time, mission accomplished, job well done.

The overall story is pretty good, going about questioning the ""usual"" beauty pageant type in a heartwarming way, and jennifer anniston plays her part perfectly along with the rest of the cast, however it really was a watch then move on and didnt leave me with much impact. Still a good way to pass the time with a few small laughs",Dumplin'

The message was a terrible one, yes you should love yourself, but at one point when Millie (the only good character in the movie) was working out with the pageant girls and Will actually scoffed at her and almost put her down for it.

Willowdean is confident at the beginning of the film and the end of the film.Dolly's original soundtrack lifts the film up even more - give the album a listen -an original song she wrote for it - Girl in the Movies is beautiful.Give this film a chance, it's well worth your time!",Dumplin'

I thought that she would learn from her beloved aunt's death, which was implied to have been caused by complications associated with obesity, that eating healthy and exercising is important, but apparently not. Willowdean snaps at her mother because of her concern about her daughter's weight. She even fights with her best friend because she's apparently too skinny to fight against beauty standards. Willowdean assaults one of her classmates because he comments on her weight. Her ""hot"" coworker tells her he finds her attractive, despite her lacking personality. She sees pageant contestants running to loose weight, and this somehow angers her. Her performance for the beauty pageant is not only disappointing, but is also made out to be impressive, when in reality she just lip syncs to a Dolly Parton song while spinning a stick attached to a string.The protagonist lacks character development and seems to think that the world is against her. She thinks that all of society is going to accept her unhealthy habits and support her as she slowly kills herself. Willowdean's defining characteristics are: discriminatory, rude, entitled, stubborn, overweight, and a fan of Dolly Parton.

243,mrrsna,Seizing the spirit of Dolly,8,28 December 2018,"It appears that it really is the age of Netflix as we have another crown winner film in our midst. Today I decided to give the recently released Dumplin' a try, honestly not expecting much. I've always been a fan of Jennifer Aniston and Dolly Parton though, so I figured worst case scenario I'd try the first 15 minutes and pretty quickly get an impression of if this was worth my time. And oh, what a treat was in store.Dumplin' is a radiant gem tucked away in the digital scape of Netflix, I'm actually surprised it didn't receive a wide release. It's everything I like in an enjoyable movie; it's funny, sweet, heartwarming, joyous, appropriately dramatic, just the right amount of theatrical, and has a strong point of view. The coming-of-age flick genre is one I will never tire of, but also can be problematic. We often get the same tropes and messages, but Dumplin' does not do this it all, nor does it simply hand you all of the tidy answers you want. It takes all of those repeats, flips them over, and throws some glitter on them. What we get is a fabulous ensemble of actors who beautifully compliment each other (and a particularly likable lead played by Danielle Macdonald); even the smaller moments are all seized and played very nicely. A story about challenging yourself and the wrong you see around you, recognizing your beauty and running with it no matter your shape, size color, where you're from (I think for many of you fellow southerners this will hit home with the beautifully crafted small southern town environment) and the difficulties that come along with that challenge. We get to see honest relationships and their hardships between the different dynamics, and how the view of yourself can affect those very negatively. Of course this movie, like almost any, isn't without its flaws, but it overall feels nicely paced, self-aware, and plays to its strengths. I would highly recommend Dumplin' if you're looking for a positive watch with a strong female lead, great humor, and just enough drama to make an impact without becoming too serious.Dumplin' knows exactly what it is, and does it on purpose. What more could we ask of a movie like this than to be the shining spirit of Dolly; and Oh, how it expresses that!",Dumplin'

245,laurieng,A 10 Star Delight From a Former Pageant Girl,10,12 December 2018,"This movie was well written and even better acted by this cornucopia of cast. I really liked the cast and appreciated the new faces I had not seen before. The use of Dolly Parton and her brilliant songs was a pleasent suprise. Hopefully the millennials watching this will learn of Dolly's unmatchable talent the ""old time"" style of storytelling through song. Jennifer Aniston was the perfect fit for her role. I think she actually was involved in script writing. I think she is as beautiful as her ""Friends"" days.
As a former pageant girl myself, I appreciate the realness within certain scenes and the ""inside jokes"" of pageant competition. The pageant world is so unique with quirkiness and the movie hit the mark to keep me interested the entire production. The movie cast also had a few talented drag queens with stunning costumes. I even had a moment where I paused the movie to appreciate the beautiful Dolly Parton costumes. So much sparkle.
I recommend watching ""Dumpling"" if you need a funny ""chick flick"" moment in your day. Just sit back and enjoy singing along to some of Dolly Parton's best songs.",Dumplin'

The acting is strong--! You immediately understand that Willowdean has never felt the gaze of admiration that her own mother just visited on a stranger.Willowdean decides to enter the pageant as a protester/revolutionary upon discovering her departed aunt wanted to participate in the pageant that found her mother queened.Good for her!Except she loses sight of the point & becomes judgmental of other ""outsider"" contestants. Not good. It frustrated me to watch her tell another heavy girl contestant that she shouldn't participate. Aaaack!!Bless our girl, Willowdean. With the help of some renegade friends and some amazing drag queens, she gets her priorities straight!Don't worry, cynics---she doesn't win. At all. In fact, she's completely disqualified, and it's AMAZING.This film is a wonderful story about learning who you are, and coming to terms with your own worth and desires vs. societal norms.Bits of the story were super predictable, but overall, I recommend this film to anyone who just wants a good, entertaining flick, as well as anyone who wants a reason to believe in the human spirit.",Dumplin'

260,dijaselimi,All of your magical sidekicks are here!,1,29 December 2018,"Basically, there is a heavy girl whose eager, but poorly-planned, attempt to compete in a beauty pageant is ""rescued"" by drag queens. Oh, and here is the hook: the beauty pageant is chaired by her beauty-queen mom and she wants to prove that beauty comes in all sizes. So we get: a) the inspiring and funny aunt, whose only flaw is that she is fat and dies early and tragically leaving our hero all alone b) the magical black man who is ALSO a drag queen (a real two-for-one token deal in this gem) and c) a ""crazy and colorful"" cast of Dolly Parton-loving drag queens who save the day with big hair, a magic act, sequins, and a dance number!

262,akkevdgalien,Blij,10,15 May 2019,"Echt een feel good movie.
Met hier en daar even een emo momentAanrader",Dumplin'
263,sevenabreu,my opinion,7,11 February 2019,"""The difference of winning and losing is in the details.""
They are phrases, like, those that appear filling the plot and the script of this film.
It tells the story of a teenage girl named Willowdean or Will (Danielle Macdonald). Which has, how, referenced his aunt Lucy deceased at six months. A type of ""fairy godmother"" of a contemporary fairy tale. Which leaves its greatest heritage its teachings (a brooch found, which is a very symbolic amulet). His ability to help and enrich everyone around him was what most stood out in his personality as long as he lived. The film makes that clear. Incidentally Will for being an overweight teenager. She is an empowered girl, but still has her own inner conflicts over certain issues or achievements of any ordinary teenager. His love life, his beauty ... The most interesting thing is to know that his mother an ex miss that obvious loves his daughter, but has rooted the standards of beauty in his mind. She still lives on it (see the movie). Creating a conflict between the two. Without spoiler the film shows several characters with different personalities and styles. And, how, each one can have its space and recognition before all.
We learn from the film the importance and weight of the words spoken or not, depending on how important we are to them.
So I recommend this movie.",Dumplin'
264,haqqeye-29758,Warm and touching,10,30 December 2018,"I loved this movie! The message was great without being too sappy. The characters were rich, and I LOVE Dolly Parton, as well! Nice job! I want to read the book now!!",Dumplin'
265,nfayee,I loved it !!,10,8 December 2018,"It gives an upfront look at a battle with insecurities, and distant relationship due to not understanding one another in families. And i Adore Will and Elles friendships!",Dumplin'
266,gatannahfiles,If you only watch this for how female friendships are portrayed...,9,8 December 2018,"... that will be plenty. The young (and older) women in this film are supportive and kind to each other. Netflix has plenty of titles where women are enemies (or frenemies), undermine each other, try to get revenge, and are generally nasty in their own selfishness to be fulfilled. It is insulting to me as a women to be portrayed as though I feel like every other female is a competitor in some zero sum game where if they succeed, I lose something. So it's nice to see a film where women are not catty and petty.Furthermore, it's great to see a film whose star is not a skinny gal, but in which skinny gals aren't portrayed as horrible people. No one ""type"" is a jerk, except a couple of rando high school guys, but there are plenty of male characters who are lovely. Most, in fact.The movie avoids so many tropes typical to all cinema, but especially these Netflix rom-coms.1) Put-upon outcast goes crazy and does something harmful. I was truly nervous when Will walked into the alteration room and saw all of the pageant dresses. Many other offerings would have had her trash the dresses to teach her mom a lesson or something, but she was so focused on her love of her late aunt, the whole scene ended up being darling.2) Frustrated/confused love interest takes some meantime action on the side. The guy who was interested in Will never wavered.3) Speaking of #2, though, the love interest angle wasn't even the most important one. The story is based most prominently on the relationship of Will to her late aunt, and stemming from that, her best girlfriend. And Will's fragmented relationship with her mother. And then the friendships of other high school girls who make up the pool of (eventual) pageant contestants.I watched several Netflix original movies during TV hiatus this summer, and many were downright alarming. I wanted to like ""Kissing Booth,"" but in the end, it was a story about two brothers who felt inappropriate possession of a common girlfriend. ""Sierra Burgess is a Loser"" and ""F the Prom"" both had characters who ended up doing horribly mean things, which we are supposed to nod and understand because they felt rejected. I didn't get past the first 30 minutes of ""When First We Met"" or Groundhog Day II or whatever.I'm just saying this movie is a cut above most of the Netflix originals, and doesn't have an overarching problematic theme. Definitely feel-good, and you can genuinely like most of the characters.",Dumplin'
267,emilydshelton,Using Drag Queens as Fairy Godmothers is Tired,4,9 December 2018,"Dumpin' tried to put forward a good message, about big girls being beautiful and deserving too. I like how the pageant ended - plausible and realistic. I really disliked the depiction of the queer drag queens in this movie. There was no explanation of their connection to the Aunt at all. And no acknowledgement of the struggle for acceptance of gay and queer people. This movie was all about the struggle and acceptance of big girls' beauty ONLY, and I felt they used the queens as a narrative tool without ever recognizing what they might be going through in a society that enforces rigid gender and beauty norms.",Dumplin'

I don't get made fun of (at least that I know of) but I believe that's more so because of my RBF and overall attitude. In many ways just like Willowdean. I relate to the character much more than I thought I would. Which has me thinking that if this movie was made 10 years ago it would've helped me in so many ways through high school and beyond. But that doesn't mean I'm not thankful it's around now because these struggles are so real for so many young women. All I really mean is that if you or someone you know could be struggling with facing fears because of weight you need to watch this movie.
