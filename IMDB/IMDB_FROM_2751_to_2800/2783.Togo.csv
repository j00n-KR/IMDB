0,SnoopyStyle,Disney all the way,8,26 March 2020,"It's 1925. Leonhard Seppala (Willem Dafoe) drives his dog sled home to Nome, Alaska and his wife Constance (Julianne Nicholson) ahead of an epic storm. The team is led by his beloved lead dog Togo. There is a diphtheria outbreak which threatens the town's children and there is only one man who can travel the distance to retrieve the needed serum. His dire quest becomes a media sensation.This is an old fashion Disney doggie movie in the best way. It is Based on a true story. It has its thrills. It is heart-warming. It's a simple adventure. Dafoe is great. The ice stuff is fantastic. The Balto bit is the cherry on top. This is Disney at its old fashion finest.",Togo

2,Lejink,Good to go Togo,8,18 April 2020,"I admit it, I'm a sentimentalist. I cried like a baby at my own wedding while my wife looked on in bemusement. I weep at favourite songs or pieces of music and shed tears freely at emotionally charged movies. It was my wife's brother who recommended we watch this movie during lockdown and I really should have read the signs. First off it's a Disney movie, secondly it's about a brave dog ...and right from these two facts, I knew I was going to struggle to get through it dry-eyed.And so it proved. With films like this, for me anyway, critical faculties are suspended and you just want it all to end happily so that you don't have to hide your feelings anymore. I do know that Willem Dafoe and Julianne Nicholson were excellent in their parts as the slightly mismatched couple who set up home in the remote, frozen, northernmost part of America. He's the local ""mush-man"" responsible for trekking his team of husky dogs over unforgiving terrain for the benefit of the local community while she provides all the back-up back home he needs for them both to keep their operation going.Comes a catastrophic diphtheria outbreak to the town, especially targeting young children and the need to requisition urgent medical supplies from some 500 miles or so away, but with an impending spell of bad weather knocking out the possible use of aeroplane or rail transport, the only way to go get the job done is for Dafoe and his dog's to undertake a hazardous cross-country trek like no other to collect the vaccines and get them to the hospital to help save the kids' lives.With a storyline given added topicality and piquancy by the devastating Covid-19 virus outbreak, this was a thrilling and moving race against time, taking on the elements and indeed the odds, the effort spearheaded by crusty old Dafoe and his pack, especially Togo the pack-leading dog. Early on we're fed the back story of how Togo came into the couple's possession and how the dog's irrepressible desire to accompany Dafoe on his travels sees him twice unsuccessfully try to offload the dog to new owners, only for Togo to somehow find a way to break free and return back home from whence he came, Finally Dafoe is persuaded by the dog's errr... doggedness, to reluctantly road-test the apparently under-sized dog and eventually concede that its courage and stamina outweigh any physical disadvantages it may have.We see the pack endure unbelievable dangers in their epic mission, Togo literally pulling out all the stops to navigate the team over breaking ice-floes, slog up snow-bound foot-hills and even save the group from certain doom near the end, in a particularly amazing show of love, strength and fortitude by the dog.It's a Disney film so there's probably a fair bit of dramatic licence taken with the story but you'll have a good idea how it ends. The landscapes, making great use of drone shots on-high are frequently eye-catching and there's was a plaintive lonesome-violin soundtrack which further set the scene. I don't know how much of the cinematography was C-Gen assisted but the actions of the dogs and Togo in particular, looked natural to me.Anyway I got through to the end with some dust in my eyes and immediately afterwards felt the need to hug our own dog of over ten years in sympathy and appreciation for what I'd just seen.This one's for you, Flip.",Togo
3,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Togo or not to go.,6,18 April 2020,"'Togo (2019)' finds its charm whenever it focuses on a very well-trained puppy portraying an intolerably untrainable one, and it finds its excitement whenever it focuses on the stylistic feats of sled-dog mastery required to navigate its focal Alaskan storm. Its action is an odd mix of real-life animal work and CGI set-pieces. However, its overall formalistic effect isn't entirely unsuccessful. It never comes close to feeling realistic but it evokes the effect it's going for. Some of it's actually suspenseful. The story isn't the most compelling, though it does have a good set-up and proper stakes. It just doesn't grip you, exactly. It's well-written but generally dry. A lot of it is just characters talking about how good its eponymous dog is. The relationship between the dog and his owner is tangible, though. The movie is entertaining enough throughout. Its overdone ending isn't the best note to go out on, but the experience is fairly enjoyable nevertheless. 6/10",Togo
4,ThomasDrufke,The Heart of a Survivor,9,30 December 2019,"At this point, I don't care if every dog movie involves the same themes, emotional beats, or endings, if the movie sucks me in emotionally it will get my approval. Togo is a film that I was almost completely unaware of until a few weeks ago when I saw the trailer. A tale of bravery, loyalty, and an underDOG that was unfairly forgotten about for decades, Togo is one of the best films of the year no one is talking about. An absolute win on every level as Willem DaFoe and company prove there is still plenty of room for a dog movie in a crowded marketplace every once and again. Check that, I'll take one once a week.9.5/10",Togo
5,851222,Good and involving movie,9,11 April 2020,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Togo"" (2019) was a very good, old school movie. By saying that i mean that it relaid on a story well told, and not special effects. There are good characters in this movie, but true star(s) of this film are dogs. They were amazing - and not CGI made! You do feel the difference.Overall, ""Togo"" was a really involving movie for all its running time. Its was sometimes funny, sometimes sad and always true and very good.",Togo
6,briancham1994,True appreciation of a dog's heroism,8,20 August 2021,"Unlike the false sentimentality of Balto or Hachiko, this film shows the true heroism of a historic dog with all the nitty gritty details. The eponymous character is brave, energetic and loyal - but he is also mischievous, chaotic and stubborn. The relationship with Seppala is one characterised by both love and rebellion, befitting the true nature of a dog. Credit must be given to the filmmakers for the realistic and harrowing portrayal of a dog's tough journey through the brutal Alaskan winter. The flashbacks imparted a great deal of context and personality to Togo, which goes a long way when he can't speak!",Togo
7,Thanos_Alfie,What a story...,8,27 October 2021,"""Togo"" is a Biography - Adventure movie in which we watch the story of a sled dog and his owner, Leonhard Seppala, who traveled to receive and transfer a package of medicine to cure some cases of Diptheria. They have to travel through a strong storm and overcome many obstacles.I liked this movie very much firstly because it is based on true events and secondly due to its great direction, plot and interpretations by its cast. Despite that the story is simple, it has plenty of suspense and does not let you be calm through its whole duration, something that I found extraordinary. Willem Dafoe's interpretation as Leonhard Seppala helped on that since he was simply outstanding. The flashbacks were also very helpful for the character building and also helped us understand the bond between Togo and Leonhard Seppala, and how it was created. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Julianne Nicholson's who played as Constance Seppala and Christopher Heyerdahl's who played as Mayor George Maynard. In conclusion, I have to say that ""Togo"" is an amazing movie and I highly recommend you to watch it because I am sure it will leave you speechless.",Togo
8,cruise01,Edge of your seat adventure about a friendship between a man and a dog.,8,26 December 2019,"(Togo 4 out of 5 stars).Togo is a good adventure true story about Togo a leader husky of a dog sled. Where they travel hundred of miles to get medicine for a small town in Alaska. Facing against the harsh weather and a race against time to save kids who are sick with an epidemic illness. Its a great story. Togo was a stubborn and frustrating pup when Leonhard (Willem Dafoe) and wife Constance (Julianne Nicholson) first had him. Leonhard was a strict dog owner. No dogs on bed. He has huskies trained for a sled. Togo was always eager to be part of the sled. He would escape the dog pen or barn to interfere when Leonhard was out with his sled. When an epidemic sickness is infecting all the kids. The nearest town with medicine is 600 miles away. They organize a relay sledding team to transport the medicine. Which Leonhard and his sled led by Togo travel hundreds of miles to get the medicine to bring it back.The direction and script kept the movie moving at a fast pace. Putting Leonhard right into action with his travels. Facing against storms. A frozen lake cap. And edgy mountain trails. While the film flashes 12 years earlier to focus on Togos earlier years as a troublemaking puppy. Which was also fun and cute. The film has a thrilling and edge of your seat adventure sequences. While giving the audience a break throughout with flashing back to the earlier years with Leonhard not happy with the troublemaking Togo.Willem Dafoe and Julianne Nicholson are great with their characters. I have to say this is probably one of the best dog movies ever. With great acting. Good story. Exciting thrills. The setting was spectacular on capturing the beautiful landscape of Alaska and the snowy mountains.Ericson Core direction was great. He did great in setting up the action. Literally having us gripping the seat when Leonhard is riding the sled up on the mountains. And barely keeping on the edge. Or racing against the frozen lakes that are breaking into pieces. That scene was spectacular. The music score by Mark Isham was also good as well. The film does show a bond and friendship between Togo and Leonhard. And it can be emotional at times.Overall, Togo is a good film. If your looking for an exciting adventure film about a guy racing against time on a dog sled. This is worth checking out.",Togo
9,eddie_baggins,A fantastic surprise. One of the best Disney film's in years!,9,15 January 2020,"Arriving without much fanfare or expectation to the recently made available Disney + streaming service, you'd not be the only one heading into Togo with zero to minimal hopes for a film that on paper seems like the perfect middle tier type production, but throwing those feelings out the window is a dog-centric true life tale that is some of the best original work The Mouse House has done in the last decade.Likely to join beloved recent canine filled film's like Hachiand Red Dog in the hearts of movie-goers across the globe, Togo tells the heartwarming and nigh on unbelievable true story of heroic Alaskan sled dog Togo, who alongside his owner and trainer Leonhard Seppala saved the lives of countless children in a secluded snow incased town in 1925.Known as the famed 'serum run', highlighted in animated film Balto and well known throughout the United States, the deeds of Togo and Seppala allows unassuming director Ericson Core, his lead performer Willem Dafoe (does this man know how to deliver a bad turn?) and his core team of four-legged stars too combine together to deliver one of the most enjoyable and powerful family adventures of recent times.Not at all feeling like the direct to streaming offering that it is, Togo feels grand and cinematic in all the right ways as we join Seppala and his sled team as they precariously venture out into the storm clad wilds of the unforgiving Alaskan surrounds, while Core's well-played out and downright enjoyable detours showcasing Togo and Seppala's early relationship is sure to appease even the most cold-hearted of viewers.In many ways Togo never messes with the true story Disney formula that has been a staple of the company for many a moon but there's a special something found in almost every aspect of this confidently made and respectful outing, that's clear affiliation for its subject and subject matters ensures that it's an engaging experience from start to emotionally powerful finish.It's a journey that will take viewers on a wild ride of varying emotions from laughter, tension and more than likely a few well-deserved tears (honestly damn you and your dastardly ways On The Nature of Daylight) as you can't help but fall head over heels for one very faithful and special pup and his commitment to his cause that has stood the test of time for almost 100 years, as one of the most exceptional examples of the bond between man and his best friend.Final Say -One of the most surprisingly outstanding releases of the last 12 months, Togo is a standout Disney + release and a likely candidate for one of the most beloved new Disney films of the modern era.4 1/2 barn escapes out of 5",Togo

12,billcr12,Great Doggy Tale,9,27 December 2019,"Togo was a Siberian Husky sled dog in 1925 who led a team through a storm in order to pick up a serum for children with diphtheria. It is a typically Disney feel good family film. I was captured from beginning to end. Willem Dafoe is great, as usual, but the star is the Husky who seems almost human. Togo belongs on every top ten list for 2019. The scenery is spectacular and every once in a while we are reminded of the potential of movie magic and Togo is a perfect example of it.",Togo
13,r96sk,What a film,10,19 November 2020,"Stunning, truly stunning.As I pressed play on 'Togo' and began watching the initial scenes unfold, I was expecting a rehash/retread on Disney's previous films on this sort - e.g. 'White Fang' or 'Iron Will'. Those are good in their own right, but this 2019 film - which is about a true story - takes things to another dimension.It tugs at the heartstrings profusely, from the first scene to the very last. It's superbly written, with there being a fair amount of surprises in terms of how the story unfolds. It's shot beautifully and put together, via the set design etc., excellently, while the score is magnificent.Then you have the dogs, who are insanely charming throughout - especially, of course, the star that is Togo (Diesel). There's many a moment with him that produce all the feelings, from joy to sorrow to everything in between. The dogs are great and incredibly adorable.Away from all of that, you have an outstanding performance from Willem Dafoe. Before seeing this, the most I remember of him is his role in 'Mr. Bean's Holiday'. This now takes over in those regards, it's a brilliant job done by Dafoe. Julianne Nicholson merits praise, also.What a film. Not what I was expecting whatsoever, in the nicest possible way. Glad to see it has also been highly rated online. A must-watch!",Togo
14,andrewchristianjr,EMOTIONAL!,8,9 June 2020,"The movie has it all. Great script, great action sequences, beautiful cinematography and most importantly, emotion.

22,markthomassintek,Pleasantly surprised,8,10 May 2020,"REVIEW - TOGODifferent studios seem to release similar films at the same time, I don't know if you have noticed this but I certainly have and with the recent release of The Calll Of the Wild with Harrison Ford and the terrible scoop do animated dog there was another film released at the same time, TOGO.The difference between the 2 films, whilst set in the same area of the world is most striking in the stories, the dogs themselves but especially the acting, William Dafoe is simply amazing in this film where as Harrison Ford wasn't.Follow the inspired by true events, the story TOGO from being puppy to earning the respect from his owner and becoming the lead dog pulling his sled and one very dangerous but life saving journey.Bit confusing in places with the flashbacks but one very enjoyable film which actually pleasantly surprised me.Rating 8 out of 10",Togo
23,kjproulx,A Heartwarming Story,8,24 December 2019,"Even though Disney has been releasing a few gems over the last few years, it's really no secret that they're having a blast making money on their classics. Whether it's continuing Toy Story or making tons of live-action versions of their animated films, audiences, although flocking our to see them, don't seem to be all that impressed. With the exception of their franchise in The Marvel Cinematic Universe, I really can't see a new franchise blossoming for them anytime soon, unless you count the fact that they now own Avatar. My point is that it's always nice to see them take on an original film and Togo is their latest live-action original to be released, but this time by their streaming service, Disney Plus. Is it worth watching? Absolutely.Without giving anything away for those who haven't heard the real story, Togo tells the opposing story to Disney's 1995 film Balto. Known as the 1925 serum run, Togo follows Leonhard Seppala (Willem Dafoe) and his sled dogs as they travel through impossible conditions to retrieve medicine for a hospital with dying children. This is the core premise of the movie, but it's also equally about the bond between owner and dog. This film will have fans of both animals and drama tearing up. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with this movie.Although it doesn't do anything new for films like this, it adds a depth of emotion that most of them are devoid of. Willem Dafoe, although not giving an award-winning performance by any means, remains committed from beginning to end. I found myself attached to these dogs, due to the love that was very clearly coming off of him. On top of that, there are some great visuals for a film that wasn't released in theatres. Disney Plus is clearly trying to release some quality content on their streaming service.In the end, Togo is a great film to watch with families around the holidays, so I believe those who have subscribed to their service will be enjoying this one very much this year. For the classics, Star Wars and Marvel content, I can definitely recommend signing up for this service, but I believe purchasing a month of this service just for this movie will even make you happy. It's a great feel-good story, even though it does delve into some sad elements. There's not much else to say about this movie. It's very well-made and emotionally satisfying. I absolutely recommend checking it out.",Togo
24,Neptune165,the end was depressing,4,8 May 2020,"Disney did not end the movie on the facts of Togo's end. But the story was about Togo's heroic effort. It's probably said to be a sad ending because Seppala gave him to Elizabeth. So they were separated for a long time and only reunited just before Togo's death. This was never showed in the movie. Not really a sad story, but definitely wasted potential for the movie, considering the Top tier actor named Willem Dafoe they hired for the main role, the euthanasia scene would've been so well delivered. After the serum run, i was definitely READY to get hurt. The real story is amazing & inspiration but in the move a lot of details missing.",Togo
25,maccas-56367,Best film I've seen this year,10,20 April 2020,"Pretty sure I'm going to end up crying whenever I think of this movie for years to come.Togo completely exceeded my expectations. It was epic, heartwarming, gripping, funny, and emotional. It had a bit of everything and the fact it was based on a true story made it even better. Importantly, it corrects history in a really effective way.Has instantly become my favourite performance and role of Willem Dafoe. He was great. Julianne Nicholson was excellent as his gentle, kindhearted wife. Diesel's performance as Togo should also ensure he join the likes of Benji in the dog-acting hall of fame. The film really excels at making the viewer feel as if Togo was their own - while also reminding viewers of every loyal dog they've ever had in life.The cinematography and scenery was breathtaking - literally. Has been a while since a film made me feel so cold! It's both a beautiful (and sometimes brutal) film to watch. The ice scenes were a definite standout.Togo is the perfect film to watch with your dog. In 2011, Time Magazine listed Togo as the most heroic dog of all-time. That should be enough for anyone to watch this excellent Disney film. Hopefully this is a sign of good things to come for Disney Originals!",Togo
26,0w0,"Very good, but uses an excessive amount of CGI",8,22 August 2021,"This movie uses more CGI than most action movies today.... there's seriously MINUTES of CGI used in the movie, and it's not good CGI either, it's very easy to see that it's CGI (and that's when you know that it's bad CGI). So I think the film could certainly have benefited from cutting WAY back on the CGI. It also would have made it so that MUCH of the $40million budget wasn't wasted on needless CGI... and perhaps that money could then have been spent on making the film slightly longer (which I think it would have really benefited from since the film actually ends very abruptly after the serum run is completed).But otherwise, it's a very good true-story movie and captures a pretty important historical moment during the diphtheria outbreak in 1925 Alaska. Willem Dafoe delivers some great acting throughout.Overall, it's a great true-story movie and certainly worth a watch. 8/10.",Togo
27,MrDHWong,An inspiring tale of the relationship between humans and canines through the most challenging of hardships,9,2 January 2020,"Togo is a drama film based on the true story of the important people and dogs involved in the 1925 Alaskan serum run. Starring Willem Dafoe in the lead role, it is an inspiring tale of the relationship between humans and canines through the most challenging of hardships.In 1925, an outbreak of diphtheria develops in the Alaskan town of Nome, causing several young children to become seriously ill. In response to this, the mayor of Nome tasks sled dog musher Leonhard Seppala (Willem Dafoe) with traversing through the state to collect a serum and race back as quickly as possible. In spite of the serious snowy conditions, Seppala and his team of Siberian Huskies, led by the energetic, high-spirited Togo, set forth on this dangerous mission, determined to make it back with the serum no matter what.With its great use of landscape and solid acting, Togo goes above and beyond the normal human and dog bonding story to become an exhilarating adventure decades in the making. Throughout the film, we are constantly reminded of the loyalty and resilience of the Siberian Husky known as Togo, who always defies the odds in spite of his physical limitations. It was just so touching to watch as Togo trudges on through the harsh snowstorms and dangerous terrain, proving himself a valuable sled dog to his master Leonhard. Dogs truly are man's best friend and films like this serve to further emphasise this to us all.Director Ericson Core frequently uses creative wide open cinematography to show off how expansive the Alaskan scenery actually is. This helps give the feeling of how much ground Leonhard, Togo, and the rest of the sled team must cover in order to complete their mission in time. In addition to this, certain scenes kept me on the edge of my seat. One in particular involved the team travelling over ice sheets, as the cracking thin ice felt like it could break apart at any moment, reminding us that there is no time for procrastination.As per usual, Willem Dafoe gives a reliably strong performance in the main human role as Leonhard Seppala. Dafoe depicts Seppala with a stern yet caring demeanor, which according to some sources, was how he genuinely was in real life. Of course, the real star is Diesel, the Siberian Husky who plays the title dog himself. Not only is he absolutely adorable when he wants to be, but the stunts he pulls off are wonderful to watch as well. These dog breeds are known for their loyalty and companionship and it was nice to see this shown off in such a loving fashion.Overall, if you love dogs just as much as I do, then this film is well worth your time. Even if you believe you have seen all movies involving heroic dogs, this one still may have enough surprises to keep you invested. As previously stated, dogs are man's best friend and it never hurts to be reminded of this.I rate it 8.5/10",Togo
28,Draysan-Jennings,It was alright,7,22 December 2019,"Not bad not great, but worth checking out. I really liked the cinematography. Wasn't a tear jerker like everyone is saying, but definitely a heart warming story.",Togo
29,MovieCriticOnline,Ridiculous..,3,24 December 2019,"Does anyone actually believe that this happened the way they showed it? I hate when Hollywood exaggerates actual events. The scenes on the ice were just laughable.It just didn't live up to the hype as the emotional film between a man and his dog. I didn't buy any of the stuff Togo did as a pup. Wayyyyy too smart for what they showed. It was just poorly written. They could have focused on other things to make it stronger. Too many shots of the dogs running and the scenes became too repetitive. The acting didn't help either. I'm so tired of Hollywood actors forcing expressions and words to manipulate the audience should feel. Let the audience decide how we should feel by just showing the story. People in real life don't behave like that unless they are kids or liars trying to manipulate someone.Togo was more annoying than anything for them to have kept him. Besides they showed no reason why he would keep running back to them. Why?Too bad. In the right hands, it could have been right.",Togo
30,DLochner,Excellent! A little Masterpiece,9,14 March 2020,"Disney finally manages to create a film that stands alone. Full of emotions, seriousness and love. What Disney put on the screen here is a little masterpiece. The cast with Willem Dafoe and his dog Togo is excellent.It is reminiscent of Jack London's wolf blood, and it only needs animals and humans and the tension and emotions are there. To this day, the dog Balto, who ran the last stage, counts as the hero, who even got a statue in Central Park. But it was Togo that ran most of the way. In this film he is finally given honor. A hero.",Togo

33,TheHoodOfSwords,Brilliant Dog,7,22 December 2019,"Mid way through this movie I had to call my dog over and hug him, this movie is shot brilliantly. The emotions you feel are raw and real and it was absolutely amazing. I have a couple complaints with this movie, mainly the movie has some pacing issues. The movie cuts between Togo being a puppy and Togo being an adult. Togo as a puppy is all ""fun and games"" and Togo as an adult is always high stakes. The movie feels like it is arranged weirdly. This movie is pretty darn good though. not quite an 8 out of ten for me, but a solid strong 7.5/10.",Togo

But Togo is definitely a film that can be enjoyed by anyone any age, a brilliant and accurate telling of the little-known story behind the more famous headlines. Willem Dafoe plays his part excellently, and is the perfect choice to chronical the changing emotions of this hard Norwegian.

A lot of people from the 90s know the story of balto through the animated movie from 1995, How revered as a hero for bringing the serum back. How he had statues dedicated to him in his honor. Togo reveals the truth of how the embark played out and how Togo played the biggest part in the journey we reaping none of the awards and praise. Willem Dafoe as Seppala gives a great performance and you really enjoy the bonding that him and Togo developed over the course of their lives.

He then try to have him be a sled dog and realizes how great he could be. Then he gets to thinking if his purpose is something else.This movie isn't advertised at all. The first thing I saw of it was a small little advertisement in the corner of the IMDb page. I think if they told more people it was coming, maybe some more people would have bought Disney plus. I bet many dog lovers would love this movie and from what I have seen, critics have also been saying it is pretty solid. I have to say I like it too. These are the type of movies Disney needs to put on their streaming channel. From what I remember they might too! I thought William Dafoe gave a pretty solid performance. I always thought people under looked him as an actor but I have been starting to realize that many people enjoy watching him in films. All of the other actor did a great job in this picture. In my mind, it was just William Dafoe with a bunch of dogs. For the whole runtime of the film I was always in aw while looking at the ice breaking, or the snow covered mountains, or even just a patch of trees. It looked really beautiful. It looked like someone went out into Alaska and took pictures of a bunch of mountains, ice, and trees. That is how great it looked. I thought the lighting wasn't the best. It was pretty dark and at some scenes hard to see. There were also some flashbacks that pretty much came out of nowhere. In my mind, those were small problems.Overall, I really enjoyed watching Togo. I would recommend it if you have Disney Plus at the moment.",Togo

It is a straightforward story that tugs at the heart strings. It also has realistic and meaningful characters. In particular, it has a wife who actually behaves like the wives I know and see.The acting is good. The scenery is excellent. The camera work is mostly very good. The dogs are loveable. I really enjoyed seeing Julianne Nicholson play the role of the wife. She worked with her husband (which is rare to see in films today). She complimented her husband well, although it would have been good if she had at least one fault. Willem Dafoe delivered his usual solid performance and he's a pleasure to watch. He plays strong and flawed well.I enjoyed watching this film. It is probably a little better suited to my children. Definitely worth a watch. Netflix is hit and miss.

The dog actors and their trainers deserve so much credit for their roles in making this movie a successful one. I had an idea that the movie would end on a sad note and although it didn't really, I still wept.

I believe that knowing it's a true story made it even more impactful. but I am so glad that that credit is given now where it's due.
Willem Dafoe and Julianne Nicholson did a great job and especially the puppy who played the main part of Togo.
I've always been a Willem Dafoe fan but with this film he's really cemented as one of my all-time favorites now.

Good movie.,7,13 February 2020,"This is a good Disney+ original drama about the 1925 serum run to Nome, Alaska, the same subject as the 1995 animated cult classic, Balto, although Togo is much more accurate to the true story than that film was. This movie features some really solid performances, with Willem Dafoe being the standout, as is usually the case. If you like dogs, definitely watch this movie! It has cute dogs everywhere, and I think they are mostly real with minimal CGI. I'm always amazed at how expressive these animals can be and what they can be trained to do. The subject matter of the movie was very interesting, I feel like I learned something about history from watching it. It also features some really intense and thrilling action sequences that had me on the edge of my seat! I wasn't that into the structure of the film, it was told in a nonlinear way that kinda took me out of the experience sometimes. That, and I didn't think the cinematography or the editing were anything to write home about, but other than that this is a good movie that gives you a good old-fashioned triumphant feeling. It's worth a watch if you have Disney+.",Togo

The less number of reviews of this brilliant movie is a proof of that.But after watching this movie, I am sure this is going to be a cult animal movie in the days to come.The cinematography is breathtaking to say the least. The acting, direction, script everything is just superb. Willem Dafoe as always shines in the male protagonist's role. And the dog as Togo, the most heroic animal of all time is extraordinary. Take some tissues with you as you may not have dry eyes towards the end. In my opinion =, this is one of the finest movies of this year and perhaps the best animal movie alongside Hachi. Please do not miss this masterpiece.",Togo
59,jsucie,I think I have dust in my eyes,9,18 November 2020,"Truth be told, last month I had to put my furball down so this movie hit me a lot harder than it probably would have under normal circumstances. It's not the sadness of death because that is inevitable; but the sadness of missing THAT companionship. The companionship that many develop with their furry friend. The companionship that is shown in Togo. Even the guilt that Willem character feels when Togo looks like he might not make it brings back guilt felt afterwards.
This is a wonderfully shot film with beautiful shots of Alaska and the serenity and brutality of the Alaskan wilderness during the 1920's. There were times where it looked like it was a painted backdrop or the green screen CGI looked off. I don't know how much of this version of the story of Togo is true but if it did happen; there's a legitimate reason why this dog, companion, friend, was celebrated throughout Alaska and the sled dog world.
A great movie for the family",Togo
60,hotrobinproductions,"What a beautiful film, great job Disney+",7,3 January 2020,"William Defoe does a great job, as well as the other cast, but the ones that really steal the show are the dogs, especially Togo, and this is his movie. The flashbacks work to make a coherent story and doesn't feel warned out, usually when a movie goes to the flashback or continues the story you sit there like UGH hurry so we can get back to the interesting stuff. But with this film they both hold big interest and has you glued to your screen. It takes a little for the movie to kick but once it does it really delivers. Hopefully Disney continues to make films as good as this if not better. Great movie!",Togo

Cinematographer Ericson Core has done his best job in this movie. Cinematography and CGI are the best part of the Disney+ Togo movie.The way the director Ericson Core wanted to connect the entire story with us and he was successful in it.

67,Diablo1616,Epic Movie,9,3 January 2020,"Disney just epitomized it, that too all in epic proportions, with #Togo.
What an incredible movie about the most spectacular, heroic animal of all time, who unfortunately didn't come under the limelight until the 21st century !!
Nevertheless, the base of the movie is of ""Herculean"" stature displaying the ardous, yet a life saving, ""feel-good"" journey that every sensible being will feel.
Direction, performances(from both the human and the animal) are impressive, while its the cinematography that stand's out in this project. Beautiful scenic beauty captured and shown which added life to the characters and the journey and thanks to #Hollywood for building these kind of inspiring films for the audiences.
Lastly, huge accolades and love to the dogs(especially the Lead) for characterizing the originals and displayed with such ease and with pure animal instincts.P.S : These kind of movies should be witnessed in the BIG screens for the optimum satisfaction",Togo
68,Bad-Good-Great,Fantastic! Absolutely fantastic!!,9,21 December 2019,"This is the first time that I think Walt Disney Picture did a great job on this amazing movie. A movie that deserves to be called ""Mission Impossible!"" Willem Dafoe and Julianne Nicholson both are great. The screenplay writer Tom Flynn gave us a straightforward plot, simple but amazing scenario that has made this movie so suspenseful, thrilling, at the same time, profound. Director Ericson Core also won my praise wholeheartedly. The special effects team did a wonder too, many scenes I just couldn't believe possible to make, but they just looked so real and so powerful. The crossing lake scenes are just ridiculously fascinating. The leading dog's performance is just beyond any word could describe, and the poppy that played Togo's younger age would allow you to understand what ""cute"" really means. Willem Dafoe, what a great actor! Julianne Nicholson, her natural talent completely shinning through the whole movie. Every part of this movie is a fulfilled perfection, it also owes to the great casting job, through the lens of the camera, offering you great cinematography, followed by a perfect editing job....The almost impossible mission, the dogs, the great couple and the great town people...all together, have made this movie THE VERY BEST MOVIE at the year end of 2019.Highly recommended!",Togo

71,heykateforever,So Glad I Got Disney Plus For My Grandchildren...,10,29 December 2019,"Because Togo is definitely worth the channel! At my age, I grew up with Disney movies and parks. Togo is, absolutely, a throwback to the great movies made when Walt Disney was CEO of the studio. Willem Dafoe was a perfect choice to play the lead character and Julieanne Nicholson was absolutely wonderful as his wife. Togo is a movie based on a true story about the Diptheria outbreak in Nome, Alaska, in 1925 and the dog sled race to get medicine from another city 600 plus miles away back to Nome to save the children of this small town. This movie has so much heart and soul, it's a rare gem in the movie world today.In reality, it's about the love between a man and his dog that takes twelve years to discover. I loved everything about Togo. The acting, the humor, the scenery, the cinematography, the directing, the heart, and especially the dogs used to portray these sled dogs of the 1920s in Alaska were of the highest degree I have seen in a long time. Because of Togo's age (12) and the difficulties of the trip that ended up being almost 300 miles in the middle of one of the worst storms ever seen up to that time in the area they had to travel, the very last leg of the Journey was run by a dog named Balto, who was nationally hailed as the hero of the Journey. In reality, it was Togo who saved the children with his amazing strength and love of his man, but was too ill to make the final run to Nome.I have had and loved and lost many wonderful dogs in my lifetime, so I admit that I cried nonstop in the last 15 minutes of this movie. But be aware, the ending isn't as sad as I thought it would be. It was absolutely a perfect ending to a perfect story in a perfect movie. I would give this movie a 15 if it went that high. One of my top 20 favorite movies I have seen in my lifetime. To say I highly recommend it, is an understatement. You can now bundle Hulu and Disney Plus together and save $7 a month, which is what we did as a gift for my daughter's family for Christmas. However, I have already watched more of the movies and shows on Disney than they have at this point. Do yourselves a favor and watch this wonderful movie.

It had a lot of atmosphere, great filming and a nice Christmas like grunchy effect on the borders to give it that somewhat dreamy Christmas old style look, yet I could still not get immersed in it. It felt all a bit too straightforward in characters and pasted on emotions. The scene with the ice breaking on the river was also completely overdone and ruined it for me as well. It's just an entertaining movie with that very clear Disney flavor in top of it. It lacked anything that gave a sense of realism. It was all about that Disney emotion. In my view you then didn't do justice to the real story. It makes me even wonder how much of it is real. Not bad, but nothing special either. Nice Christmas movie though. For kids om sure they love this. A hero dog, who wouldn't love it. Too bad they couldn't add more character to it.",Togo

Disney couldn't even make a dog film right and that's a big shame for them.",Togo

However, the best leaders are like this, with their own ideas and persistence. Norton Bay where the sea ice burst is too exaggerated and unreal. This is the biggest failure of the whole film.

This Story is set in 1925 in Alaska, there is an outbreak of Diphtheria that has the whole territory pinning there hopes on the cure arriving in time. The problem is that the serum is a 640 round trip from where they are. As the film begins you will see William Dafoe who plays the role of Leonhard Seppala, a MUSHER, and his dog team. The town pin their hopes on the fact that, Leonhard and his dogs will be able to not only overcome the length of the journey, but also the fact that the area is experiencing some of the worst storms on record. Leonhard's dogs are lead by Togo.As you see the team set of with the whole town out seeing them off and hoping that they can do a journey. Its a race against time. Can they make the Journey in time? Can they make it, there and back at all?During the journey the film takes you back 12 years to give you the background on how the team, well more Togo had developed. Here you will see Julianne Nicholson portray Constance Seppala (Leonhard's Wife). Now i'm not saying much except, he isn't like most of the dogs! you will seeExcellent work by Disney and a film i'm sure a lot of people will enjoy.

This is the true story of the sled dog team and it's owner who carried the medicine in Alaska to rescue Nome Alaska during he 1925 Diphtheria epidemic.
In much worse than normal blizzard conditions, the sled driver risked all to take a shortcut across a thawing body of water, thus saving 90 miles from his trip.
The movie reveals how the wrong dog, ""Balto"" was credited with the ordeal...and it is to the Disney studios for making the correction.
It reveals how even back then, the press was more eager to ""get the story"" than to ""get the facts"".The wife and I were blessed to have lived for sixteen years with a grey timber wolf...and we understand how an emotional attachment remains long after such a friendship can exist.

It was great to see her audibly coach the dogs through each perilous scene and giggle every time Togo was disobedient. The movie itself is okay. As with any movie, Willem Dafoe is the best part. It's cute and the intense emotional scenes work fine. It's a little bland looking. Everything is dark blues or faded oranges. Depth of field in the beginning scenes felt a bit strange as the borders of the frame were out of focus. Clearly an intentional choice, but it's not one I really liked.That's about it.

I mostly liked the start and the end, but sadly i read after watching the movie that the end was also romanticly enhanced.

First off, I have no idea how they were able to train those dogs to act the way they did in that movie, that in my mind, was pretty incredible. Based on the film making and the movie as a whole, I would consider it a masterpiece. The storyline had a perfect blend between timelines that came together to tell the story of Togo in an amazing way. I was able to understand this dogs life and the life of the owners ever since he was a pup. The story from 1925 in general was incredible just to see. How 20 teams in this ""serum run"" ran the relay, where all of them ran 31 miles except for one of them running 264. I personally, love historic movies and this one came second to none. I'm not sure how accurate it was, but they made it seem that Balto, the dog that finished the ""serum run"" was the villain because the press praised him instead of Togo. Personally, that iritates me off a little, but I could care less because this movie was a 10/10. It's frustrating that this movie is only on Disney+, I would like to see it released in theaters and find out how other critics and just normal movie goers think of the movie. The conclusion and ending to this movie was nothing but excellent. The sound editing between the breathing of the dogs, running, thoughts from the owner (Willem Dafoe), who did such an incredible job in this one I personally think this is his best movie. The ending of the movie was so touching it was incredible. It's sometimes hard to explain how good this movie is, you'll just have to see it yourself to believe me.

The cinematography will take your breath away. Living in Nome Alaska in 1925 would be like living in hell for most of us, but it still shines with beauty - the mountains, the ice and oceans. The story was interesting and I learned much about the illnesses that struck then and dog sledding. The acting from the dogs was the best I've seen in a Disney film.

146,rfrankssr,"""Harnessed to your Heart""",10,17 January 2020,"""Harnessed to your Heart"". Such a beautiful film with a wonderful performance by Willem Dafoe, who plays Leonhard Seppala, who raised Huskies in the Alaskan Wilderness. History tells us of the great serum run in 1925, but Balto was the dog honored on the last leg, the final 55 miles, and that's the one remembered. Within that run was a 264 mile round trip led by a dog considered too small and too old to do the job. But, Seppela knew otherwise, hence the basis for the film Togo about a forgotten dog that Time Magazine called the 'greatest animal hero of all time'(2011). Shot in a way to give us the loneliness of that era is the story of frustration with a mischievous puppy that turns into an incredible bond of love and loyalty. Dafoe is in his element here with a character that plays to both strengths and weaknesses. Add to that a subtle but haunting score from Mark Isham and guarantee you will be in tears by the time Seppala says the words ""harnessed to your heart"". A monumental achievement for Disney +.",Togo
147,wryboy,Terrific true story to set the record straight,9,11 January 2020,"True story of the incredible dogsled team lead by musher Leonhard Seppala and his lead dog Togo. Many dogsled teams participated in the 600+ mile relay to deliver serum to halt the Diphtheria epidemic of Nome Alaska in 1925, but only one of those teams traveled over 260 miles in sub-zero and often blizzard conditions. The most famous team was the one that actually delivered the serum, lead by Fox and Balto, the latter dog Balto of course receiving all the fame. This movie is a reminder that it was Seppala's team led by the incredible Togo that vastly outdistanced all of them.The film begins with the outbreak of the Nome epidemic with Togo an established and senior dog of 12 years old and uses flashbacks to recount his early years and all the trouble they had with this unruly, smallish but lightning fast and amazingly intelligent puppy. His destiny was to lead the sled team and lead it he did. Can anyone possibly imagine the heart the dog must have had at that age to guide a sled team in such conditions and for such a distance. It's incredible when you realize it actually happened.A thoroughly enjoyable family film depicting the real story of courage and heart. As a dog lover, this is a keeper for my dog story shelf and one I will return periodically for sure.Run Togo Run !!",Togo

CGI was used but sparingly I felt, a few touching moments to help you feel invested, and a warm ending all add up to a great film. Enjoy that they chose not to voice over Togo (the sled dog) always find that tacky. Only real gripe with the film is it seems to contradict the story told in earlier Disney pretrails of the story in Balto.. without some serious reading it's hard to tell which story stays more true to the real events...

The flashbacks were fantastic and added so much more life to the movie. This movie is a masterpiece. I am so glad that it depicts the true heroes of the serum run- Togo and Leonard Seppala.,Togo
158,cdcordaro,Good cinematography. One dimensional characters and little excitement.,4,28 December 2019,"Can't believe all the good scores. It makes no sense or they're false. Sure, the dogs were strong and full of passion but the writer completely left out the stories of the doctor, other racers, families who lost children and much more. I'm very familiar with this story and have read two books on this event. This is basically schlock and meant for the very young viewer, 6 - 10 year old. Adults will be incredibly bored. The writer started off by putting us in the middle of the epidemic and then did flashbacks to catch us up with the heroes. That's lazy writing in my opinion. I couldn't watch it. Turned it off.",Togo

I mean really loved one?If you have you will love this movie.It's a great story and well told.
We learn that Togo is the runt of the litter and early on has a determination that is not to be denied.This is a true story which makes the telling even better.It's interesting to know that Togo & Balto were trained by Sepp.
Because Balto runs the final lego of the Serum Race, he seems to have gotten all the notoriety. He ran 31 miles, while Togo ran 264 miles over some of the most treacherous terrain in Alaska.I've always liked Willem Defoe as an actor. Whenever I watch the Grand Budapest Hotel, his character just makes me laugh.In this film, he brings life to the character of Leohnard Seppala.
It is truly an inspirational story.
As I'm watching, I'm thinking of all the dogs that have been a part of my life.
If you have been a dog owner, you will understand.The best part, it's all true!The children live because they receive the drum in time.
All thanks to these brave dogs and their masters.Kudos to Disney for brining this story to the screen.I took my young Sons to Manhattan and Central park to see the statue of Balto. They should have one for Togo as well.",Togo

As and academic with a BFA in film production I appreciated all of the nuances that were so well done. This story gets you invested in the characters and the reality of not only their situation but their history. Best investment pays off in spades. I found myself crying uncontrollably. I realize that I am hypersensitive because of the pandemic. But that takes nothing away from an incredible story of human nature combined with animal nature combined to save a society with unfathomable obstacles in the way. This is a must-see film.

183,footscrayvic,A tribute to great dogs,9,14 November 2021,"A well made and well acted film, but the star is Togo.I found this film to be a tear jerker as it strongly reminded me of my father's dog, Tim. Tim was an Australian kelpie (a sheep dog) and his bond with Dad was like in the film. He was devoted to Dad.Dad had firm views on his dogs and would not let us treat them as pets (no patting of dogs), and like in the film (no dogs in the bedroom) Dad's dogs were never allowed into our house. They were cared for and trained but not pampered at all.At one time Dad had to have major surgery and was away from the farm for weeks and when he returned he was bedridden for months. During that time Tim fretted and eventually stopped eating entirely. Mum was concerned and tried to coax Tim into the house to see Dad but Tim wouldn't enter the house. So my elder brother picked him up and carried him into my parent's bedroom. Dad was able to put his hand out of the bed and reassure Tim with a pat on his head. Tim licked Dad's hand and wagged his tail and then went straight outside and ate his food. Dad eventually recovered.Some dogs are amazing. But their lifespans are short so it is always difficult when they die.",Togo

At first I thought this movie may blend right in with all the other sleds dog films, but the personality of Togo really brought a new life to this storyline. Though the story itself seemed a bit flat, and the characters were very shallow, Togo's focus kept my interest throughout the movie. I really thought the flashbacks were a nice touch throughout the film as it broke up the journey to tell the whole story inbetween. Despite what I said about the characters falling a little flat, I'm glad the main focus was on shaping Togo's character and personality, as he was the hero of the story.",Togo

I give this a 10/10 with much ease and no hesitations whatsoever.",Togo
186,gccuconati,Better than Balto!,10,27 June 2021,"I've seen Togo a few times, and I love it. It's based entirely on the excellent story of Togo, a sled dog with intelligence, stamina, courage, and, most importantly, heart, and his crucial part in saving Nome, Alaska from a horrible diphtheria epidemic. Togo looks almost exactly like he did in real life, except for the eyes. Willem Dafoe is excellent in the role of Togo's musher, the famed Leonhard Seppala, and delivers so many funny lines (""Next time I go the wrong way, you tell me to go to h***!"")! The story is very touching and amazing at the same time!!!! And most importantly, this movie delivers a heartwarming message that even when loyal dogs leave you, they'll stay harnessed to your heart until the day you leave this world behind! It also acknowledges that while the press gave the credit to the final team's lead dog, Balto, and his musher, Gunnar Kaasen (since they actually brought the medicine into Nome), and Balto even received his own statue in New York (which I visited), Togo will always be remembered as the true savior of Nome, since he lead Seppala and his team across the most dangerous bit of the serum run.Overall, Togo is a remarkable improvement over Amblimation's 1995 animated box office disappointment, Balto, which was far too mean-spirited and riddled with uncanny animation and historical lies, including violent and scary moments that never happened. I can't believe Steven Spielberg would subject kids to something like that!!!! Balto's only redeeming factor was probably its music (the late, great James Horner's thunderous score and Steve Winwood's gorgeous, inspirational blue-eyed soul ballad, ""Reach For The Light""). Avoid Balto, but Togo is a compulsory viewing.",Togo

That being said.. what's with all the praise?The Special FX and cinematography are bad, everything looks fake, I don't think I've seen a sky that wasn't added and/or created in a computer... And what's up with the weird blurry letterbox and digitally added pixel noise?? It's awful and just made the film unbearable to watch. The soundtrack is just an annoying violin playing the same 3 notes for the entire movie. And I haven't even started on the story...For me the story was painstakingly predictable and just boring, it felt like the entire film was the exact same scene with different dialogue options. Not a single character was actually interesting and the flashbacks are unnecessary. I didn't feel a connection with any of the characters and therefore the movie never really touched me.As the titel says... I've seen some great and fun films that don't get the praise this film does. And it feels like a lot of people are just biased because they liked the story before they even made it into a movie. It's certainly not a ""bad"" film but it's also not nearly worth the solid 8 it has at the time of writing this review.",Togo

Yes, the task for Togo and Seppela is to save the lives of many children in danger for that they should take a Tough journey.Between the journey we can see lots of Joy,Happy,Emotion, Inspiration,Care along with the Hardwork of this Togo sled team.
Visuals are so good to watch as seems like us living inside the world of Togo. I liked the Screenplay more and its neat along with all Technical aspects.
But I have one big worry about the movie on its release. They not released it in theatres and Worldwide, making the movie not popular and unknown for most of them is Major Drawback. Since My request will not be received by any crew members of the team but I here say heartfully that, to kindly release the film Worldwide in Theatres and don't make the movie worthless
Verdict : Must Watch Excellent movie
Best scene : (1st time to present this column Togo made me to do it) When Seppela thought that Togo is Happy while Hiking as lead dog but later realizes Walking with him is important for Togo that's what makes him happy, where Loyalty lies on his Owner ( My eyes got Wet on that scene as well as Seppela had while seeing Togo sitting on a Ridge)",Togo

I had read various accounts of the great serum run from online sources as well as the book, ""The Cruelest Miles,"" many of which hail Balto, although an important and tenacious dog, as the hero of the story. However, when you dig a bit more and read accounts from diaries of mushers and families whose children lived (and thus generations of families) because of Seppala and Togo's heroism, you see the real truth. Without those two, their speed and tenacity, the serum simply would not have made it to Nome. This film, tells the truth in a way that is utterly heartwarming without being syrupy and ""Disney-ish."" I've always admired Dafoe, but he gives a wonderfully understated performance that draws you into the story as if you were there watching it all in person.

226,emily967166,Togo - the heart of a survivor and a hero for the ages,10,2 October 2020,"If anyone is looking for some inspiration for a film to watch, try Togo - available to stream on Disney+.Now, I wouldn't usually write a film review, but this one made such an impression on me, I feel I must do my part and spread the word.Firstly, this is a film about a 12yr old dog who pulls a sled 250+ miles in one of the worst Alaskan blizzards on record, to get a desperately needed diphtheria anti-toxin to the Alaskan town of Nome in 1925. The feat itself is truly incredible. There are no words, Togo is one of a kind. You may have heard of Balto? Well, this film is a historical correction of immense proportions. Turns out, Balto only ran 20 miles of the 640+ mile ""great serum run"" as it is known. This film is an emotional rollercoaster - it's fun, exciting, heartwarming and just what you need right now (trust me).Secondly, the acting, cinematography and cgi are amazing. Ok, this film is all about the dog, and what a powerful film it is, but I truly did not expect the visual feast that was scent (couldn't resist) my way. It's astounding what can be done these days.And of course, no film review would be complete without a mention of the soundtrack. It's good. Really good. And features some recognisable music (Arrival anyone?)It isn't very often that a film really moves me to want to tell the entire world about it. But I feel this film is such an underrated movie; I'd never heard of it before seeing it in the rolling promotion carousel on Disney+, and let's be honest, neither had you. And, like me, you'd probably never even heard the name Togo before. But you have now and all I can say is this film is full of heart and packs a powerful punch and is really deserving of a watch. And yes, it's very family friendly.So after you've watched it, if you're anything like me, when the credits start rolling, you might find yourself heading to Wikipedia to find out more (sorry it's the inner geek in me!) and believe me, you won't be disappointed.Watch it and thank me later.",Togo
227,natasha-r-mcgrath,Good boy Togo!!,10,3 January 2020,"This movie was incredible! Loved every minute of it....from the acting, to the incredible scenery, to the amazing dogs and a heartwarming true story! I was an absolute blubbering mess by the end of it 😭 This movie is a definite MUST see!!",Togo
228,DakSurf,"TOGO, Leader of the Pack",10,26 December 2019,This was an absolutely amazing story of the serum race of 1925. Togo was an amazing dog and the life he had with his owner was a truly extraordinary bond between human and animal. Although someone else mistakenly got the credit for the serum delivery Togo remains the hero of this story now and forever. This movie is a must watch for animal lovers ÷specially for those of you that love dogs.,Togo
229,Lypus,I cried... And I Loved,10,6 June 2021,"I was totally caught off guard by this movie!I can't specify what hit me, but I was in tears almost from beginning to the end. Both happy and sad tears.I have an aging dog myself. He's a 10 year old Ridgeback. And yes, he is my heart.I love my dog more than I can explain with words, and I make sure he knows it every day. That said, this masterpiece of a movie was like an emotional rollercoaster for 2 hours straight.There were so many things that touched me, but I couldn't specify what ir was... I constantly pictured my own dog in Togo, and that overwhelmed me.The movie makers have done a fantastic job showing how deep the love for an animal can be.My own dog has been limping a little the last few months. After weekly sessions with a chiropractor, physiotherapist and laser treatment, he is finally getting better.Seeing Togo limping at the end had the same effect as squeezing onion into my eyes.",Togo
230,dwiimor,Rose above my expectations,9,26 September 2020,"When I read the few lines about the movie, I thought it sounds like the old animation ""Balto"", which I loved as a kid. So I wanted to give this one a try. Similar to ""dog-movies"" this one is based on a true story and from what I could understand, shows the truth in a more clear light compared to the adaptation of Balto. And it is almost 100 years ago this took place.The purpose of the film was to portray a story and the connection between man and canine, and I believe it did so perfectly. The last 30 minutes of the film i was crying on and off.The camerawork is excellent, as is the acting. The whole film except for one particular part (that was added for excitement) feels genuine and believable.So in relation to what the purpose of this movie was, its deserves at least 9/10.
Everyone that has ever owned a dog will love this movie. And people who didnt own a dog will want one!",Togo

243,boatdoc,"""Hollywood"" doesn't mess up the ""real story.""",10,25 January 2020,"There are the mildest of spoilers in the following review - for any who would prefer a completely unspoiled viewing experience I'll just say go watch the movie - quick!Like many, I swallowed the story of Balto being the hero of the Fairbanks to Nome desperation dog-sled Serum Run, and though I knew Balto didn't lead the only team on this heroic 600 mile journey, I had no idea that another team, lead by another dog and driven by another musher had gone 264 miles, including crossing a trecherous frozen sound - twice - while the other 19 teams averaged 31 miles. (The Balto team completed the final 55 miles, which was heroic enough, but as the team that arrived with the life-saving diptheria serum, Balto got to be the hero. Ironically, Leonhard Seppala was the owner of both Balto and Togo, but Seppala wanted the best dogs on the longest and most treacherous part of the journey and Balto didn't make the ""first team.""As a story, it's exhilarating, but the acting and cinematography and other elements such as costuming and editing and music all add up to by far the best ""dog movie"" I've seen. Playing Leonhard and Constance Seppala are Willem Dafoe and Julianne Nicholson are excellent actors and they have real chemistry with each other and with the dogs. Drones and other innovative techniques are used to capture brilliant ""live"" footage with what I assume must have included some CGI shots for the harrowing journey across Norton Sound, which I don't doubt was breaking up in real life - I learned that the movie gets this part right: the ice had completely broken up and floated out to see the next morning.I'm a little curious: The real Seppala's had a daughter who was 8 and living with them in Nome. For some reason she is not shown or mentioned and there is even a scene where Constance is questioning Leonhard's motivation for making this death-defying run, during which Leonhard explains that they know several of these children and their parents. Since all three household members, but especially young Sigrid, were vulnerable in an isolated town in the midst of a raging diphtheria epidemic with no other cures available, I'm just a little curious why this wasn't depicted in the film.",Togo

248,quieroalquilarunpiso,These are heroes! This is courage!,9,1 January 2020,"All you see nowadays are people throwing around the words ""courage"" and ""heroic"" to describe any mundane event or unremarkable person.
Those words should only be used to describe anyone like the two main characters of this film.
This is more than just a tale about a man and his dog. This is a beautiful story about bravery, determination and risking all because it's the right thing to do and not in an attempt at glory.
I cried alot during the movie and now thinking of it I'm crying too. It's that touching and moving.
To think these two characters did what they did and aren't both immortalized with a statue or something is just inexplicable.
This film also taught me about a certain breed of dog that came into existence because of the real Togo.
Willem Dafoe proves again he's the European definition of actor, a true artist.
I was also relieved to see such a strong female character! Finally! I always admire these type of women that people often overlook or don't appreciate because she's a wife, a friend, a homemaker and a man's driving force.
And many times throughout the film her husband talks about her in a way you can tell there's alot of respect and admiration for her even when he says she's stubborn it's a compliment trust me!
What a beautiful marriage.
The wife is also fundamental to the story in different ways not just as the man's safe haven from the world. But I can't explain why without giving away the story.
That dog... one in a million. To be lucky enough to have had a dog like that must be extraordinary.
I almost didn't watch this film because my mind was comparing this to 2 other movies ""snow dogs"" with Cuba Gooding Jr and that Paul Walker film ""Eight Below"". Thankfully I ignored my mind's comparisons. This film is more in tune with ""Eight below"" but it's in a very different tone. I liked ""Eight below"" alot and ""Togo"" too.
This film requires your full attention because it jumps from one time to another. One minute you're seeing Togo as a pup the next Togo is struggling for survival. It doesn't confuse you if you're paying attention and it's also an interesting way of telling the story.
I didn't give it 10 stars because of a few scenes I don't agree with that have no relevance whatsoever to the story but were added for the reasons I don't agree with and I can't say what or this website will censor me and also other than that, this movie is a must.",Togo

264,danyalsadeeq,"William Defoe spouting ""good dogs"", and it's sure to melt your heart!",10,21 December 2019,"Togo is a character driven tale that focuses primarily on the central ""man and his dog"" tale rather than the wider race against time (and elements), and it's all the better for it. The film flits between present day and flashbacks, nicely building up the central bond between Seppala and Togo - recounting his mischievous puppy years in which the musher tried to give him away twice(!), to him finding his heroic place leading the pack. It's a beautiful bond that will undoubtedly melt the iciest of hearts; you know what they say about the purest love being between grumpy dads and the pets they said they didn't want!
Core brings the impressive feat of dog and human endurance to life with gorgeously sweeping wide shots framing the beautiful, but often deadly, vistas of Northern Alaska. The action was suspenseful and tense, coupled with an overwhelming use of icy blues and an endless white that transported you into the rough terrain. The only downside to the film was the at times small-screen feel about it, particularly when scenes took place in the towns.",Togo

I think it deserves 4, and I think people are giving 10/10 because it is based on a true story, and it is a dog movie.The worst part is there was no emotion in the movie. They figured out everything quickly. There was always a quick solution. I never felt like they could not have done it. I never felt the failure so they can come back with determination, passion and ambition. Everything was too quick yet the movies is really boring.He did not accept the dog at first since he was a bit too playful and moving. However, one day he accepts him suddenly.The script is too poor. I just watched the movie yet I dont even remember any quotes from the movie besides Dafoe saying ""Good dogs!""The story could have been told from a different perspective, so it is not always ""Togo, Togo""
The scenerio could have been much more emphatic, powerful, and uncertain. Therefore it is more gripping and shocking.I am a bit dissappointed in the imdb ranking. So I felt like I had to write a review. There are much more impressive movies than this to make your children to see.",Togo

From begging to end this movie is perfect.The way that it is told (with flashbacks to Togo's early days) is perfect - and that's considering that I initially found it strange that they started near the end of the dog's life.Somehow, not seeing Togo grow up from the get-go or living with him through his life's struggles just made the story that much more impact-full. I think it's because they said just enough about his past to leave the rest of his character to the imagination, making everyone's opinion the dog the correct opinion.I was desperate that they did not spoil the film with a poor ending but Disney hit a home run with this one. The ending is on point, beyond my mist wistful dreams!Great job, Disney!",Togo
281,jinclema,An outstanding tribute!,10,23 December 2019,"As someone who was a huge fan of the film ""Balto"" as a young child, I was thrilled when I heard about the impending release of this movie. For a long time I've wanted a live-action, historically accurate film about the events of the serum run, and this did not disappoint!The plot of this movie mainly focuses on the life of Togo (hence the title) and his career as a sled dog, as well as his unparalleled devotion to his owner, Leonard Seppala, who doubted his abilities as a working dog during his earlier years. Togo received little recognition for the major role he played in saving Nome from the diphtheria epidemic, and this film spared no expense in showing us what sacrifices were made by both him and his musher to save the lives of others. On top of the strong emotions this movie makes you feel, it also delivers a bit of comedy which was unexpected, but very amusing!I couldn't help but feel nostalgic from the various ""Balto"" references, which weren't surprising since this is the same story. I was very impressed with the nod to the original film when they recreated the scene where the sled team had slid down a steep mountain slope, stopping themselves just before falling over the edge of a cliff. Balto makes a few cameo appearances towards the end, but more so for the purpose of ""de-throaning"" him by pointing out that he, by a twist of fate, ended up taking the credit for saving Nome when it had been mainly Togo (and over 100 other dogs) who all played an important role. By the end of the film, I was nearly tearing up because of how touching the final scene was as a tribute to Togo's life, as well as the epilogue and photo before the end credits.This movie made me laugh, it made me cry. It was the long-awaited re-telling of this remarkable story of the serum run we've needed for almost 100 years. Togo is finally recognized for the hero that he is. It is one of the best and bravest things that humans and animals have ever done!",Togo

I never thought I'd enjoy a movie about a frigging dog-sled, but it was so damn good. I laughed, I cried, I gasped, I was on the edge of my seat during some parts and giggling away at others. Too slow-paced for kids, but definitely a good watch for adults. Also interesting because it's damn near spot on accurate to the real story (or so I read afterwards), and yet it's STILL exciting AF.

I grew up in the dog mushing capital of the world, Tok, Alaska. For decades until the 1970s Tok was home to the world sled dog championship, and I lived a quarter mile from the start. I grew up watching George Attla and Dr. Roland Lumbard compete with 8 and 7 world championships, respectively. Togo exaggerated the drama of the ice flow breaking up, but they always do in Hollywood. Willem Defoe carried the entire weight of the cast with his commanding charisma. The rest of the cast might as well have stayed home. All except Togo. Love this movie.",Togo

If you are a dog owner, you will most likely cry after watching this. I would rate it in the top 5 movies of the year. 10/10 - storytelling, production, cast, everything is on point.
If this was a superhero movie, everyone would know about it, shame it's not marketed heavily. Highly recommend watching this.",Togo

Willed Dafoe brings light into a forgotten character in history and in addition to Togo, a beautiful story about a snow dog who is strong, fill event and relentless. He makes me love my dog 10000000000000x more!
It is great movie for the family or just yourself.
But I would have to advise you on something, have tissues for the end of the movie! (Happy tears)",Togo

This movie was emotional and heartwarming. This movie reminds me so much of Mission Impossible and A Dog's Purpose. This movie shows how loyal, intelligent, brave a dog can be.

328,jimcoats,Good To Go Togo,8,20 April 2020,"I admit it, I'm a sentimentalist. I cried like a baby at my own wedding while my wife looked on in bemusement. I weep at favourite songs or pieces of music and shed tears freely at emotionally charged movies. It was my wife's brother who recommended we watch this movie during lockdown and I really should have read the signs. First off it's a Disney movie, secondly it's about a brave dog ...and right from these two facts, I knew I was going to struggle to get through it dry-eyed.And so it proved. With films like this, for me anyway, critical faculties are suspended and you just get caught up in the action and want it all to end happily, especially for the dogs. I do know that Willem Dafoe and Julianne Nicholson were excellent in their parts as the slightly mismatched couple who set up home in the remote, frozen, northernmost part of America. He's the local ""mush-man"" responsible for trekking his team of husky dogs over unforgiving terrain for the benefit of the local community while she provides all the back-up back home he needs for them both to keep their operation going.Comes a catastrophic diphtheria outbreak to the town, especially targeting young children and the need to requisition urgent medical supplies from some 500 miles or so away, but with an impending spell of bad weather knocking out the possible use of aeroplane or rail transport, the only way to go get the job done is for Dafoe and his dogs to undertake a hazardous cross-country trek like no other to collect the vaccines and get them back to the hospital to help save the kids' lives.With a storyline given added topicality and piquancy by the devastating Covid-19 virus outbreak, this was a thrilling and moving race against time, taking on the elements and indeed the odds, the effort spearheaded by crusty old Dafoe and his pack, especially Togo the pack-leading dog. Early on we're fed the back story of how Togo came into the couple's possession and how the dog's irrepressible desire to accompany Dafoe on his travels sees him twice unsuccessfully try to offload the dog to new owners, only for Togo to somehow find a way to break free and return back home from whence he came. Finally Dafoe is persuaded by the dog's errr... doggedness, to reluctantly road-test the apparently under-sized dog and eventually concede that its courage and stamina outweigh any physical disadvantages it may have.We see the pack endure unbelievable dangers in their epic mission, Togo literally pulling out all the stops to navigate the team over breaking ice-floes, slog up snow-bound foot-hills and even save the group from certain doom near the end, in a particularly amazing show of love, strength and fortitude by the dog.It's a Disney film so there's probably a fair bit of dramatic licence taken with the story but you'll have a good idea how it ends. The landscapes, making great use of drone shots on-high are frequently eye-catching and there's was a plaintive lonesome-violin soundtrack which further set the scene. I don't know how much of the cinematography was C-Gen assisted but the actions of the dogs and Togo in particular, looked natural to me.Anyway I got through to the end dry-eyed and dog-tired, to quote Elvis Costello, and immediately afterwards felt the need to hug our own dog of over ten years in sympathy and appreciation for what I'd just seen.This one's for you, Flip.",Togo

350,theinkandpen,Evokes Powerful Emotions Through Simple Narrative Devices.,9,25 December 2019,"As a constant, the most powerful stories told in Cinema aren't overly complex, always consisting of those basic human elements which resonate even among the sternest of watchers. Yet, simple stories are often the hardest to put to film, as undoubtedly the immediacy and banality of the medium make it difficult to retain the more profound nature of the written word.""Togo"" tells the often-elusive simple story elegantly, without pretense, in the very fashion which auteurs strive for, almost as elegantly as Jonas Mekas nostalgic landscapes or Sokurov's poetic images.Dafoe's performance has immense power, in every crease and rugged line which speak more than words ever could, and manages to project the bond between man and beast effortlessly throughout, never needing to say more than a few words to speak straight to the heart.A lesson to those wishing to cross-pollinate between mediums perhaps, creating a confusing mish-mash of nothings; moving pictures are simple things, if only you can manage to capture the moment in the image whilst retaining its apparent simplicity, without needless hyperbole.",Togo
351,ruisilvaei,Amazing Movie,10,27 December 2019,"Just finished watching this movie and there aren't enough words to depict how highly I recommend it.
As a proud owner of a 1 year old Siberian Husky I can assure everyone reading this comment that they are, indeed, this smart.
As example, a bit shy of completing 14 months and the little rascal opens doors, gates, gets through every kind of barriers and even found a way to get over a 2 meter high protective net over the yard. Escape artist is the perfect term to describe it.
There is nothing you can throw at a Husky that will separate him from his owner and the movie Togo perfectly describes it and makes you fall in love with such a beautiful story, a beautiful dog and a beautiful breed.",Togo

355,wlozito,A Masterpiece - a Beautiful Story Told Touchingly!,10,1 January 2020,"Togo is a symphony of the heart.
I watched this movie 7 times.
Everson Core's cinematography is magnificent. The dog sledding scenes, of course, but also how he uses window panes to frame a scene. The lighting of the indoor scenes make you feel like you are there.
Willem Defoe portraying Leonhard Seppala feels genuine and real, especially how he bonds with Togo. You know this is one of Defoe's best acting performances ever,
because it does not feel like he is acting.
Julianne Nicholson is perfect as Seppala's wife and her facial expressions make you feel what she is feeling.
The writing by Tom Flynn is just wonderful. For instance, when Seppala declares, ""He's (Togo) not a sled dog, he's a lead dog!""
The music by Mark Isham arouses your emotions. And will make you cry. Isham is gifted.
There are many others who contributed to this movie to make it a Masterpiece!
I wish I could shake the hand of all those involved.",Togo

Did I cry as I usually do, regardless of the ending? I chocked on tears. Togo reminded me of my most special dobermann female that started as a mediocre puppy and developed into an amazing show and working bitch who wrote history for the breed. Togo should be an icon to every dog breeder out there who fails to give a less than perfect dog a chance.

The emotions of even togo(Siberian Husky) were captured in the frame... Good effects which means both sound and video. Movie doesn't show much exaggerated version of anyone.. Have kept in a best way possible as it was just real..,Togo
360,lacymarie-97144,Wow,10,7 January 2020,This movie was perfect. It told an actual account of what happened. There were no boring parts. I can honestly say it definitely is worth the watch. Thanks Disney!,Togo

368,cherrypickinlicken,Overall a great movie!,9,11 October 2020,"I recently watched the movie Togo on Disney +. I wasn't into it at first because it is based on a true story. Movies about true stories usually leave me crying. So my hopes for this movie were definitely not high. Then the movie began and I was immediately intrigued. The movie follows the journey of an older man named Leonhard Seppala, and his trusty 12 year old Husky Togo. Seppala leads his sled dog team, with Togo leading, across Alaska. The movie has noteworthy action scenes and a truly heartwarming backstory/plot. If you want to watch a fairly new movie that pulls at your heartstring, and feels you with a zest for life. Then Togo is the movie for you. It hits all the key points that a superb movie needs: charming characters, an extraordinary backstory, and adventure! In this 1 hour and 54 minute movie you become attached and almost connected with the characters. Overall I thought the movie Togo was a breathtaking film. That was able to accurately depict the true story of Togo and Leinhard Seppala.",Togo
369,prateskvp,Excellent movie,10,18 December 2020,"Amazing, it really touched my heart, the bound between man and a wolf was unbelievable, they were more then friends! Extremely emotional, in the end the tears came.",Togo
370,raouaabousslimi,Great Great Movie,10,19 October 2020,This is the first time I leave a review ever! I just felt the need to it. The amount of emotions in this movie is incredible ! Togo had me in tears . MUST WATCH,Togo

372,bryntrainor-06237,Dogtastic,9,26 February 2021,Watching in 2021.We are a cat family but after this my family want a dog. Great cinematography and use of greenscreen. The scenes across the ice were exhilarating with William Dafoe expelling dialogue like a shakesperean monologue as the ice fractured all around. A fantastic performance from the lead acting dog to such an extent I was in floods of tears with my 10 & 11 year olds! A Disney triumph! Ps ... I'm looking for a dog tomorrow!,Togo
373,janyrm86,Superb! Suspense! Emotional! Fantastic cast and dogs!!!,10,3 January 2020,"Loved the film and it brought me to uncontrollable tears. Great film! After watching Togo I realized that Disney's animated film Balto did not do justice to Togo. I love Balto film and always will, however, if you have watched Balto you will notice that Togo was portrayed as the ""bad guy"", . I am glad Disney redeemed itself and gave Togo the credit it deserved.",Togo
374,randvwurm,True dog movie,10,24 October 2021,"Now that's what I call a dog movie. Not only is it entertaining, the cinematography, scenery was spectacular and incredible dog sequences well trained. Leaves movie's like 'call of the wild' for dead. Bring on the live action.",Togo

Will be one of the best reviewed movies of the year. Good going on this one Disney!",Togo
378,zxenergy,"The True Story, BALTO is a farse. TOGO is the real deal.",10,10 January 2020,"This movie was emotional, suspenseful, heart warming and tear jerking at the same time. William Dafoe had an excellent performance as Norwegian immigrant who moves to Nome Alaska in search of gold. He never finds gold, but he finds his obvious calling to be a dog sled musher and driver. He raises pups and trains them to race and deliver. Then comes Togo, Togo barely survives in beginning, he's the runt of the litter. He is called weak and small but you can never underestimate the heart of a survivor and champion. Togo causes problems for his owner in the beginning and tries to get rid of togo. His owner doesn't believe in him but Togo continues to show his worth and finally he is made lead sled dog and in doing so, creates a ripple effect throughout history. Togo is a true hero and this story tells you why Balto received the credit instead of Togo. A new line of dogs is bred from Togo. Such a moving and touching story of man's best friend and how important they can be in your life and others. If you love animals or dogs in general, you will love this movie. 10/10 for humanity",Togo

Defoe does an amazing job as the main character (does this guy ever age?) and really shows his love for the lead dog Togo. The Alaskan tundra acts as the third character and its majestic views are worth the 2 hours alone. Great movie for the family and not too sad (happy-ish ending). Bravo Disney!",Togo

What I thought would be ""worth a watch"" on a Sunday afternoon 'cos dogs & Willem but...That was quite possibly thee best dog film & Willem Dafoe film I've ever seen. Literally had me in tears for the last 10 minutes, why Disney didn't put this on the big screen I do not know & I sincerely hope they release it on DVD!Dafoe was excellent at the hard exterior, soft heart persona, oscar worthy! and TOGO, jesus christ TOGO alone deserves 12 oscars just for tugging on my heartstrings & being amazing. This film had the ultimate feels, I did not expect that kind of quality from a *film when we sat down to watch it, boy were we sadly but pleasantly surprised with the result!*A Disney film in the last 5 years that wasn't animated, a musical, or a live-action remake that NOBODY EVER ASKS FOR!

404,m_m_cullen,Heartwarming and heartbreaking,10,21 March 2020,"As a Siberian Husky owner for the last 14 years, this film NAILED the tenacious, stubborn, and often downright naughty nature of these stunning creatures. It also nailed their absolute desire to RUN. This breed live for it, and it really is evident here, I hope this shuts the naysayers up. As someone who volunteers for a Husky Rescue, I also hope this film DOESN'T encourage people to get one of these dogs without making a 100% commitment for life. They have personality in spades and are very different to most other breeds who will obey instantly.
William Dafoe was the perfect choice for Seppela. He is a dead ringer for the man himself.
It was hard to hold the tears in throughout this movie, and even knowing how it ends, I was on the edge of my seat in some scenes. The last few minutes had my husband and I downright SOBBING.",Togo
405,julymoonlightstar,Amazing Movie!!,10,3 January 2020,"This is honestly one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. It was so nice to finally watch a heartwarming movie that has adventure, excitement and emotional highs and lows that completely absorb you into this movie. I was on the edge of my seat just enthralled with the storytelling and the emotional weight of this story and then for this to be based on a true story! I always had known about Balto but nothing about Togo. Togo and his owner deserve this movie to be out there and for us all to know the real heroes of that story of the relay race. Myself and family all loved it. I still have tears streaming down my face while I write this review! Everyone should watch this movie it is amazing.",Togo

They also did a wonderful job in showing how stubborn the Siberian Husky breed can be, and how this breed has hearts of gold. Casting Willem Dafoe and Julianne Hough was a brilliant move, and it is probably my favorite of Dafoe's works. I think this movie would have done spectacular as an actual theater release, but thrilled with it all the same!",Togo

Willem Dafoes performance lends to the emotional aspect as well as amps up the drama for the audience. But no doubt, credit goes to the dogs who portrayed the real heroes of the movie.
