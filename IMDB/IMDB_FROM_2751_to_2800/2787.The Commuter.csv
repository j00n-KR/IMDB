0,TheLittleSongbird,A bumpy but watchable commute,5,23 January 2018,"There was a good deal of potential with 'The Commuter'. In particular that the premise was an interesting, if somewhat familiar (especially if you've seen any other action-thriller film starring Liam Neeson), one, the trailer looked good and the cast is a talented one. Watching 'The Commuter', my thoughts were that it was very much watchable that started off promisingly and had a number of good elements. But also that it was also something of a bumpy ride at the same time that derails in the third act. Very like 'Non-Stop' (except on a train rather than a plane), of which there have been comparisons to, and the strengths and flaws are similar even. Is it worth watching? Yes. Is it a great film? Not to me, but have no regrets watching and certainly didn't think that it was a waste of time.Starting with the strengths, 'The Commuter' does look great, the cinematography is slick and often adds to the atmosphere created, the lighting is moody and neither garish or drab, the special effects are good and don't overload the film in quantity and the confined train location (should have been the star and very much is) creates a genuine sense of claustrophobia, a feeling maintained throughout even in the weaker stretches. The score is also suitably moody, not sounding too obvious or manipulative.Neeson is a very strong, commanding and appropriately stoic presence, as to be expected, and Vera Farmiga is a suitably cold-blooded femme fatale. Direction is atmospheric, some twists are fun and not too predictable and there is a fair share of thrills, tension and suspense.It is such a shame that 'The Commuter' does get far too over the top and far fetched in the third act, am trying to use the phrase ""felt like a completely different film"" much less but feel it does apply here with it becoming less thriller-like and more bombastic action-oriented. The film loses momentum at this point and the twists become more convoluted. The solution should have gone out with a bang but peters out, being too implausible, overblown and confused.Dialogue is hit and miss throughout but becomes increasingly hammy and vague at this point. The rest of the cast do their best but don't make much impression, being saddled with very little to do in sketchily written roles.Overall, bumpy but watchable. 5/10 Bethany Cox",The Commuter
1,Leofwine_draca,Instantly forgettable,5,7 October 2018,"THE COMMUTER is another brain-light action thriller that casts an ageing (and increasingly unbelievable) Liam Neeson as a kind of tough-guy hero who's always the single-handed man to solve a massive conspiracy or take down endless bad guys. This was from the director who made the lightweight UNKNOWN and it's a similarly-levelled picture. It's also very much like NON-STOP except it takes place on a train instead of a plane. Neeson plays an average commuter who lands in the middle of a deadly conspiracy and has to quickly figure out what's going on. A mildly confused first half soon gives way to the usual fisticuffs and outrageous CGI action scenes in the second, including a ludicrous train crash even crazier than the one in the Thai flick VENGEANCE OF AN ASSASSIN. Neeson is strictly on autopilot, doubled more than Seagal in one of his latter-day movies, and solid character actors like Vera Farmiga and Jonathan Banks are quite wasted. In the end, THE COMMUTER is a typical popcorn flick, lightweight and instantly forgettable.",The Commuter
2,SnoopyStyle,Non-Sense,3,4 April 2018,"Former police detective Michael MacCauley (Liam Neeson) has been taking the commuter train for the last decade to his downtown office work. At age 60, he is laid off before he gets his retirement. On the train home, he is approached by Joanna (Vera Farmiga). She offers him $25k upfront with another $75k upon finding an unknown person with some sort of bag. He tries to back out and is threatened with his wife Karen's wedding ring.The premise doesn't make any sense. When MacCauley is first presented with the offer, he says ""What?"". That's how I feel about it. It makes no sense. The bad guys are better off killing everybody on the train and they prove that they are perfectly capable of it. They are both omnipotent and impotent at the same, often in the same scene. Even if MacCauley is needed, the money is unnecessary. So much of this is unnecessary. This is an artificial construction from a Hollywood writer writing in his local Starbucks desperate to sell his (their in this case) first script. Starting from the bad premise, none of what follows can be compelling. I don't care about the mystery person. I barely care about Neeson in this role and that's mainly due to him. The Spartacus moment is truly cringe-worthy. There are all kinds of questions that a rushed wrap-up ending is barely able to address. This is simple bad writing.",The Commuter
3,Prismark10,The Commuter,6,12 November 2020,"The Commuter is a ridiculously plotted action thriller which gets more implausible as it goes on. Hats off to the cast and director for at least make it gloriously entertaining in such an over the top way.Michael MacCauley (Liam Neeson) is a former cop who now does his daily commute to his insurance sales job.However needing money to send his son to college, MacCauley has been suddenly laid off just 5 years before his retirement.On the way back home as he contemplates what to tell his wife. MacCauley is approached by a stranger. She offers him $100,000 to find one particular person on the train and plant a tracking device on their bag.When MacCauley has second thoughts, he is told that his wife and son's life is in danger.Faced with a race against time, MacCauley goes through the passengers in the train but he also discovers that there are people tracking his every move.The Commuter starts out slowly, MacCauley even has drinks with his old cop buddy. I am sure that is an important clue.What starts out as a Hitchcock type thriller swiftly moves into something like Speed or Under Siege. It is an enjoyable romp despite the flaws and some predictable twists.",The Commuter
4,claudio_carvalho,A Bad Day,6,2 May 2018,"The former cop and insurance agent Michael MacCauley (Liam Neeson) loses his job when the company where he works is downsizing. He goes to a bar where he meets his former partner and friend Alex Murphy (Patrick Wilson) and tells that he has not told the news to his wife Karen (Elizabeth McGovern). While commuting home, a mysterious woman called Joanna (Vera Farmiga) offers a game to Michael where he would locate a commuter in the train and receive a large amount. When Michael finds the money hidden in a wagon, the woman informs that he has accepted the offer and need to find the person in a few moments; otherwise his beloved family will suffer the consequences. What will Michael do?""The Commuter"" is another entertaining Liam Neeson´s action film. The unlikely story has promising beginning but the conclusion is absurd and funny. Despite the clichés, the non-stop action does not let the viewer think and in the end, ""The Commuter"" is a decent film. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""O Passageiro"" (""The Passenger"")",The Commuter
5,nogodnomasters,There is no such thing as noble.,4,24 January 2018,"The film opens with decent character introduction in 13 minutes of ex-cop. ex-insurance agent Michael MacCauley (Liam Neeson) a 60 year old recently terminated man with a family who rides the same train everyday. It is at this time he meets Joanna (Vera Farmiga) who entices him to do ""one small thing."" Like Liam, we have to figure out what is going on as threats are made about the family and people die around him in a plot as improbable as ""Non-stop"" or any other Neeson film in memory. I am growing bored with the instructions over the phone, we got your family type of stuff. This has been done to death, but hack writers can't get away from it. Yes people are killed and it is Liam's fault with the old, ""Don't make me hurt the puppy"" routine. The double climax ending helped the film, but having to get there had its moments of slow pain. Guide: No sex or nudity. F-word or two.",The Commuter
6,kosmasp,Moving train,6,24 March 2018,"Well it could have been stopped and waiting at a station. But of course it is way more interesting this way. Not that it makes much sense or anything, but Action (Grand) Hero of the moment Liam Neeson is at it again. And he can carry this movie as he did with some of the other movies he did. If you don't mind the gaps (no pun intended), then you will have fun with this.Still the end is way over the top and you may shut off any regards to reality or whatever. Other than that, this is also quite predictable and the ""what would I do"" some may have at the beginning, may go away pretty quickly. Coincidences and other stuff happen randomly, but due to the stunts and because it somehow works overall, this is quite entertaining",The Commuter

8,blanche-2,Derivative but still entertaining,7,13 September 2018,"""The Commuter"" is a suspenseful, energetic thriller starring Liam Neeson as an ex-cop who has just lost his job with an insurance company after ten years. As he's riding home on the train mulling over his huge financial obligations, he receives an offer from a woman (Vera Farmiga) with big money attached. It's an offer he can't refuse. Or can he?You cannot believe what Liam Neeson does on this train. Not only does he pace back and forth in an attempt to find a certain passenger, but at one point he hangs off of the train, looks in people's bags, gets into a fight in between cars, finds dead bodies - leading to a wild climax (if none of that was enough).A couple of things, for me anyway, were predictable but in no way did it dampen my enjoyment and nervous stomach. Very well directed.",The Commuter
9,Quinoa1984,"junk, but enjoyable on its own dumb terms",5,6 February 2018,"My first thought seeing The Commuter as someone who lives around the area this is set... I wonder if the filmmakers have ever traveled from midtown Manhattan to Tarrytown. It's.... not very far really. This movie makes it feel like it takes 5 hours to go through. But one would wish that was the biggest gripe to have here, and that's the least of the issues around what I'd dub simply 'Dumb Strangers on a Speed Orient Express'. This really is all three of those - Hitchcock, Jan de Bont, and a sprinkling (like whipped cream on a frappuccino) of Agatha Christie with Neeson on occasion as the Irish butt-kicking Poriot - but as if it was done by someone who smoked a lot of weed beforehand. Not to mention, of course, a special effects team that sometimes tried to give us realistic looking trains and at other times decided to fully embrace that this is a Jaume Collet-Sera movie (director of The Shallows and Orphan don't forget) and have CGI schlock in the final act. The one shame in this latest Neeson thriller, it starts off with a bit more of a psychological bent. Maybe it'll simply be about the personalities on this train, who he has to track down. And sure they may be types... no, no, not may, they are, down to the bearded comic-relief guy, the dyed-haired girl who has fake ID's, and of course the Donald Trump Jr-looking stockbroker who is tied up with Goldman Sachs (and for which Neeson in a cringe-comedy moment, not intentionally, tells the audience to remember to give Goldman Sachs a big 'F-you', as if it's still seven years ago and people care, but I digress). But about midway through the film, or even two-thirds of the way in, when we are finally privy to what this *plot* all about - a real who gives a good goddamn moment - the psychological tension, if there was any there, is gone (or even, dare this even tried to go there, if Vera Farmiga who sets the whole thing in motion and makes the starkest comparison to ""Strangers"", was all in Neeson's character's just-fired burnt and desperate out 60 year old mind). It's frustrating since it has that promise of trying for something a little deeper, even if it's that shallow Hollywood deepness (or as a friend of mine might call a ""deepity""), and a solid premise for a twisty thriller. and then decides to go ""eh, screw it"" and embrace its dumb when it's almost near the end anyway. I don't think Neeson could've quite anchored this from start to finish if it had been dumb all the way through, that's not how he operates as an actor and to his credit he does more with this guy than he's done with anyone I can remember in a while. But he's also left to become another fighting tough ex-copper (that's not some big surprise, it's established fairly early on), and while it's good that the filmmakers don't make him invincible and work his age and frailties into this, it still is that Hollywood action movie frailty, where somehow the decade-long insurance man is able to snap into action when called upon the movie to do so. The Commuter is junk, in other words, but it does pass the time and isn't so stupid that it's offensive.",The Commuter
10,sunwarrior13,Our Late Career Action Hero In Another Big Challenge,7,11 January 2020,"Our late career action hero - Liam Neeson - comes back with another big challenge in this action thriller entitled,""The Commuter"". He co-stars with Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson.In it,we get to meet Michael McCauley,who was an ex-cop, who got fired from his job working as an insurance salesman. Then,we meet him riding in a commuter train which he does for the last decade. Unexpectedly,he meets an interesting fellow commuter in Joanna. They got to know each other and got to talk. Their end of their conversation gets interesting as we get to see Michael unexpectedly get involved in a conspiracy after he accepts an interesting offer from Joanna.Well,Neeson's movies has become a typical action film after he became identified as an action star in the ""Taken"" trilogy. His role as Michael has become familiar as he practically plays the same badass self. In this case,we get to see him solve a mystery inside a commuter train. While the plot maybe unrealistic and somewhat ridiculous, we get to see Neeson delivers once again in his role. Overall,it is a good popcorn action flick that would provide entertainment for people who loves action thrillers.",The Commuter
11,oscaralbert,My movie theater seat-mate says that this is the kind of flick . . .,8,25 January 2018,". . . that deserves a rating of ""8"" out of 10 for its brainless, mind-numbing ""action,"" but I think that THE COMMUTER deserves a ""four"" on account of plot holes through which you can slide derailed passenger trains (sideways, to boot). She says that Liam Neeson takes quite a beating, yet keeps on kicking--I say that 60-year-old geezers will risk fatal cardiac arrest even trying to shadow-box like Liam's 20-something stunt doubles from this film. She rates THE COMMUTER as an eight because it doesn't get bogged down on stuff such as common sense, continuity, or plausibility, but I give it a four because it caters to the paranoid schizophrenic crowd. THE COMMUTER's total inability to ""ring true"" with any semblance of Real Life logic is a big plus in her view, since she frequents theaters to escape the Tyranny of Thinking. However, I believe THE COMMUTER merits a ""four"" because it may interfere with viewer's ability to ever think straight again.",The Commuter
12,neil-476,Dumb formulaic thriller,6,1 May 2018,"Michael MacCauley has been flogging insurance for 10 years after leaving the police force, when he is summarily fired for no reason. On his train journey home, a mysterious woman offers him $100,000 (badly needed for his son's college fees) to find a mysterious stranger with a mysterious bag somewhere on the train.Liam Neeson finds himself with a different name but in familiar territory as this urban paranoia action thriller unfolds. And, as with all such movies, much of the strength lies in the denouement - does it play fair, or do you find yourself wishing for something with a bit more credibility? Well, despite a police sniper looking to take MacCauley out in the ruins of a derailed coach, I was OK with the ending.Hindsight shows the rest of the film to be full of stuff which doesn't make as much sense as you would wish, though. Everything associated with the task he is given is carefully engineered for obvious cinematic suspense purposes, and not with any sense of credibility. The train - 100 miles long when you're inside it, quite short when you see it from outside - is crammed full of deeply suspicious individuals, most of whom are carrying mysterious bags. Menacing mystery woman (the always watchable Vera Farmiga) manages to phone MacCauley at every moment when she needs to do so for dramatic purposes, irrespective of whether he has a phone or not.This is a not very good film which manages to be tolerably entertaining, largely because of Liam Neeson's screen presence. It passes the time adequately.",The Commuter

Barely able to make ends meet financially, he goes to work one day and is told by the insurance company he works for that he is being fired only a few years before his retirement. So he goes to a local bar and has a couple of drinks with his good friend ""Lt. Alex Murphy"" (Patrick Wilson) who he used to work with when he was employed by the New York Police Department. Not long afterward he boards the train which he has used every day for the past 10 years to return home to his wife ""Karen MacCauley"" (Elizabeth McGovern) and teenage son ""Danny MacCauley"" (Dean-Charles Chapman) . No sooner does the train leave the terminal however when he is approached by a woman named ""Joanna"" (Vera Farmiga) who offers to give him $100,000 if he can locate a person on the train who is traveling under an assumed name. Having already accepted $25,000 as an initial down-payment he is then threatened that if he doesn't complete his task his wife and son will be killed. Realizing that someone is bound to be hurt regardless of what he does he then goes about trying to locate the person while at the same time also looking for a way out of his predicament. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film had a good balance of action, mystery and suspense. Admittedly, the plot wasn't very realistic and the ending could have used some improvement but all things considered it was worth the time spent to watch it and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",The Commuter
14,bombersflyup,Between the train and the passengers... I always knew it'd be the train.,7,24 November 2019,"The Commuter, similar to many Liam Neeson films being engagingly enjoyable throughout, but not necessarily memorable.Worth watching, without reaching any great depths. Plot's quite implausible, not annoyingly so though. Relies a lot on action sequences. Neeson's certainly a reliable lead when deciding on a film to watch. I'm surprised that so many quality actors here have such minor roles though, why not have a few of them on the train...",The Commuter
15,Wizard-8,"Never dull, but very hard to swallow",4,26 August 2018,"Liam Neeson in my opinion is a very likable presence in movies, and even in his advancing age can show toughness and resourcefulness in a believable manner. That's one reason why I sat down to watch this latest effort of his. The fact that the premise of the movie seemed to have strong similarities to one of his other movies (""Non-Stop"") did cross my mind, but it wasn't too bothersome to me. Indeed, the movie has some clear strengths. As I indicated above, the movie is never boring, having a swiftly unfolding story as well as some well crafted action sequences here and there. However, it was really tough for me to accept the core story and its intricacies. The bad guys' plan is so complex, so reliant on Neeson doing exactly what they want at the appropriate times, that it is completely unbelievable. Yes, I know that often with movies like this you have to not think too hard about things, but the movie is relentless with bringing up hard to swallow situations. If the bad guys could make all this intricate planning, why couldn't they have found their target themselves? There are a lot more worse movies out there, but this particular movie will probably insult your intelligence as it tries vainly to be really complex and clever.",The Commuter
16,FlashCallahan,Taken a Non-Stop train.......,8,29 January 2018,"Insurance salesman Michael is on his daily commute home, which quickly becomes anything but routine. After being contacted by a mysterious stranger, Michael is forced to uncover the identity of a hidden passenger on the train before the last stop. As he works against the clock, he realises a deadly plan is unfolding, and he is unwittingly caught up in a conspiracy that carries life and death stakes for everyone on the train........Another year, another Neeson release that features a one sheet that looks like the first Taken film.He's had a resurgence as an action star in the last ten years, and here it's business as usual, but with the added audacity to make it a little bit more Hitchcockian.The initial set up is interesting enough, how far would you go for a large sum of money, and the opening credits are pretty wonderful considering the content of the film, but soon enough, the film goes down the route of favouring action over plot detail, and it's a case of Neeson looking concerned every now and again, and having a fight with somebody.When a films most intense scene is that of our protagonist looking for punched tickets, you know that the makers are depending on Neesons star power to keep the audience interested.There is one impressive fight scene, that almost looks like it was done in one take, but this doesn't compensate for the lack,of urgency, and some truly awful use of CGI.Neeson is as reliable as ever, he's got the on edge man routine down to a tee, so if your looking for something just like his other films since 2008, you'll get something out of this.The film isn't surprising, amd the ending is eye rollingly silly, but you already know what to expect.",The Commuter
17,phd_travel,Enjoyable ride,8,11 January 2018,"This thriller is different enough to be interesting. Set on a commuter train from Grand Central up the Hudson Valley, a man is given a mysterious task. I wasn't bored, didn't get too confused, and was into it till the satisfactory and satisfying ending. What more can you wan't from an action thriller with Liam Neeson? Likeable supporting cast including the enigmatic looking Vera Farmiga as a mystery lady who gives him a task. And her often on screen co-star Patrick Wilson plays a cop who is an ex partner of Liam. Jonathan Banks of Better Call Saul and Breaking Bad has a small role as a fellow commuter. There are a few faults. Although the story is understandable and does come together there are a few things about the conspiracy and the villains at the end I didn't get even though I was concentrating as much as ought to be required for entertainment. The twist is acceptable if a little implausible. In fact if these people are so all seeing and smart why don't they just do it themselves? But these kinds of movies aren't meant to be analysed or they would all fall apart. Worth watching. A nice start to the year thriller wise.",The Commuter

Okay, it goes over the top with the derail of the train but once that happened the suspense is back on. A lot of special effects used like the camera moving throughout the train.

19,mm-39,Well it's just entertaining.,6,28 April 2018,"Well it's just entertaining. Liam Neeson plays the nervous, panic, stressed character pushed into a stick situation again! Another version of Non Stop and the Taken series. (Except not as well.) The same type cast characters. The usual, but not always black guy character trying to get by doing his government job, just like the Die Hard Willis cop friend character. Then there is the usual double cross cop/friend character; all these mystery movies have the double crosser antagonist. There has to be a jerk who is a salesmen/stock broker etc , and the like able ethnic friend, usually Italian sometimes of Mexican heritage with the name Tony, Rico etc. Of course the Commuter has the type cast mysterious evil women. Would be nice for the movie industry to change up the formulated character development. Have the government employee the bad guy, and the annoying salesman the hero, or anything else please. Make a wrinkle to an old tale. The mystery on the train starts out find with the money idea, but degrades with the usual plot twist of who's the guy on the plane or train etc which the protagonist has to find. They find the wrong person first, there is a fight with the sleeper agent, and of course someone has to be made an example of is the predictable formula the Commuter follows. The usual public damage with the plane, train, and or autos for the ending too. A few bright spots Neeson's hide in a hidden compartment is a cool show change. And of course Neeson is such a find actor which keeps the story entertaining. The ending with Neeson is nice.

The plot isn't bad, even though there are some parts that just make no sense at all, and the action is exactly what to expect when you watch a movie with Liam Neeson. If you see Liam Neeson's name in the cast list then you know it's going to be one of those action movies where he's trying to solve a major problem on his own, while the clock is ticking against him. It's always the same, but that doesn't mean it's not entertaining. You just have to like those kind of movies. I do once in a while and Liam Neeson is not really bugging me, like other actors that play those same roles over and over again. Basically, the action from The Commuter is entertaining, even with all the clichés, so good enough to watch once.",The Commuter
21,SimonJack,Another fast and furious action film with little substance,4,11 August 2019,"Other reviewers have aptly described the shortcomings of this film. The notion that most action sequences are preposterous in these nearly constant motion ""thrillers"" is a given. Imagination, innovation and ingenuity seem to be missing among writers of mysteries and fiction in the 21st century. So, they resort to and rely upon sequences of action that are highly improbable if not impossible and unbelievable. That's why these films so soon begin to wear thin and one loses interest.""The Commuter"" has an element of mystery, but its unraveling in the film is as incoherent and improbable as are the elements of the crime plot itself. The screenplay has holes and the CGI of a speeding train and climax only add to the unreal aspects of the plot. So, the film seems quite far-fetched. Liam Neeson's Michael MacCauley is running on high octane for most of the film. The result is a sense of a frenetic character, rather than a smart detective with good acting.The film is all about this one character, and the rest of the cast are mostly minimalized in the frenzy. No one else stands out for good acting. Like most other films in the modern genre of fast-action, far-fetched plots, and little to no acting, ""The Commuter"" is soon forgettable. But it did give me pause to wonder about long daily commuting.Having lived in a large city on the West Coast for many years, and outside a major city on the East Coast for many years, I'm no stranger to daily commutes to work. But this film's picture of early morning train commuting to the Big Apple, makes one stop to wonder. Why would anybody who spends three to four hours every day commuting to work continue to live that way? What kind of life, person and family life does that afford one? It's no wonder parents of suburbia are losing touch with their children and so many have ""lost"" them by their teens.Perhaps, with all the modern electronic technology, social engineers should consider reconfiguring the demographic landscapes of America and other countries. Plan and do things that spread the population out more - away from mega-cities to many smaller cities and big towns. Create work conditions that are more conducive to supporting family life and strong families. Give back large portions of work commute times to people for their social and family welfare. Any improvements for families are bound to improve society over all.",The Commuter
22,OllieSuave-007,Non-Stop train!,9,22 January 2018,"This is an action-thriller starring Liam Neeson as insurance salesman Michael MacCauley who gets bribed for thousands of dollars in exchange to killing a government conspiracy witness while boarding a train. The film starts off with some intrigue, showing MacCauley having been laid off from his job, putting him and his family's future in trying times. Audience members are asked to sympathize with this, as it reminds us of those caught in tough economic times. However, the main plot and suspense come almost immediately after MacCauley is confronted by a mystery woman, who tasks him in completing the disastrous crime if he is to value his life and the lives of his family. What follows is a suspenseful game of cat and mouse as MacCauley attempts to find the perpetrator and the intended victim, all the while the casualties start to mount. The screenwriter team wrote an exhilarating story that really captures the audience attention from start to finish; it's a plot that is reminisce of another Liam Neeson film, Non-Stop. However, this flick is still fun and entertaining to watch. It is quick pace with no unnecessary fillers, and there's a smack of wit and comic relief mixed in with the intense action and thrills. Overall, it's a great action film that is full of twists and turns that will make you glued to the screen and have you guessing the unpredictable outcomes. Highly recommended.Grade A-",The Commuter
23,Hellmant,"Entertaining enough, for a good 90 minutes.",6,19 January 2018,"'THE COMMUTER': Three Stars (Out of Five)Another Liam Neeson action-thriller, in this one he plays a badass insurance salesman who's drawn into a deadly criminal conspiracy on his daily commute home. The movie was directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, marking Neeson's fourth collaboration with the director (following 2011's 'UNKNOWN', 2014's 'NON-STOP' and 2015's 'RUN ALL NIGHT'). The film costars Vera Farmiga (who also starred in the director's 2010 thriller 'ORPHAN'), Patrick Wilson (who also costarred with Farmiga in two blockbuster 'CONJURING' films), Jonathan Banks, Elizabeth McGovern and Sam Neil. It's gotten mostly average reviews from critics, and it is another hit at the Box Office for Neeson and Collet-Serra. I enjoyed it to a certain degree.Michael McCauley (Neeson) was a dedicated insurance salesman for several years, until he's suddenly unexpectedly let go. After getting a few drinks, to drown his sorrows, Michael takes his regular commute home on the train. On the ride he's approached by a mysterious woman (Farmiga), who offers him $100,000 to identify an unknown passenger. At first Michael thinks it's just a game, but when he finds the money, and people start turning up dead, Michael soon realizes that everyone on the train is in great danger.The film is entertaining enough, for a good 90 minutes, and Neeson does what he does best in an action movie. Which isn't acting sadly, because acting is actually what he does best in a non-action film. He does make a good old action hero though, and this film pretty much plays out just like all of the other B action movies he's done over the years (especially the ones by this director). The plot is slightly interesting, and slightly involving, but the movie as a whole isn't one I'll remember much of a few years from now.",The Commuter

I hear it goes way faster than this train wreck.This movie would've been so much better had the first two-thirds not been so impossible of a mission to solve. I mean, never thought I'd say this, but next time, please dumb it down for us a bit. After a promising opening of a fast-forwarded view into the life of Non-Taken Neeson and Family, the movie settles into a mystery on a train. Who is PRIM and will our ex-cop hero spare his/her life before the train runs out of tracks?I really liked the last third of this movie. Almost made up for the frustrating whodunit first two acts. At best, it was well acted and shot and at worst, very boring.YES...I know Neeson's been known to play the same exact character many times over since 2008's Taken took off. I wasn't 100% expecting it here. But, I was disappointed nothing else was happening and the mystery to solve was so vague and hard to put together, my mind wandered many times. Heck, I even did and folded laundry during - something I never do when watching movies. I like to pay attention as much as I can.It's passable. Alone on a Saturday night and want some intrigue? Fine. Just don't pay too much for it and at least make it to the final act...the only one that matters.***Final thoughts: Damn! Another train movie with Vera Farmiga.

26,Lejink,Off the rails,4,14 June 2018,"Another action movie promoting Liam Neeson as an O.A.P. where the initials stand for Over-the-top Action Pensioner. The film starts nicely and cleverly, establishing Neeson as an ordinary average guy who commutes to work on the same train to central New York every working day for 10 years, getting to know the regular staff and passengers in the process. Unfortunately this particular day is going to go badly for him as he promptly gets sacked from his life insurance sales job just when he's meant to pay his children's expensive college fees.After a consoling drink with an old buddy he worked with years ago on the police force, he boards his return train still not having broken the bad news to his wife. No sooner is he sat down when he gets propositioned by a literally well-heeled female who runs by him her version of the law of unexpected consequences, at the same time playing on his need for ready cash.So much I could accept in a sub-""Die Hard"" manner but from there on the plot gets derailed by a series of ever more predictably unpredictable events, if you catch my drift, as Neeson embarks on a ""and then there were none"" process, whittling down all the passengers to the one he's meant to pick out for imminent elimination, a witness to the apparent suicide of a whistle-blower at a mega-corporation.It's a shame that all the effective build up is thrown away on a ludicrous narrative which sees Neeson get into not one but three brutal life-threatening fist fights (he's over 60 remember!), lie down next to a corpse under the floor of the train, throw himself unharmed off the train and finally derail said train but somehow uncouple the last carriage just before the main train crashes. Oh and of course he succeeds in his 100 to 1 task of identifying the targeted party before there's an overlong hostage situation played out in the final scene with a predictable twist as to whose instructions he's been following.I liked how the action was contained in the train and how the train destinations acted as a countdown for the action to climax but really, despite Neeson 's best efforts he can't stop this trainwreck of implausible plotting hurtling to nowhere.This train you can let go by.",The Commuter
27,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Insultingly nonsensical, but still one of the better 'Neeson' films",7,22 January 2018,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningMichael MacCauley (Liam Neeson) has just turned sixty, and is seeing out the last years of his safe, stable job in an insurance firm, only to find himself unceremoniously given his marching orders without any warning. But his day is about to get even worse, as he boards a 'commuter' train (hence the title!) that he's been doing for many years, only for Joanna (Vera Farmiga) to strike up a conversation with him, where she suggests he will receive a large sum of money if he takes out the 'missing link' on the train. This rapidly escalates into a threat, and before long MacCauley finds himself plunged into a desperate battle for survival with some mystery assailants.After the success of the Taken films, Liam Neeson found himself in a series of these similarly themed films, which feel pretty much tailor made for him and of which The Commuter is the latest. The sixty plus tough guy has a style and substance all of his own about him, that do make these films, for better or worse, at least unique. They have found a following that obviously draws in an audience, and judging by the auditorium I was in, it seems to have had a fine opening weekend.It's all really the most far fetched, ridiculous nonsense you'll ever see, pushing your suspension of disbelief to the ultimate limit and leaving you feeling slightly insulted in the process. The script seems unsure of its tone as well, framed around being a tense, claustrophobic suspense thriller, but with Neeson randomly throwing in wacky wisecracks like it's some Bruce Willis movie. There's also some unsubtle social commentary thrown in as well, regarding Wall Street fat cats and the deposed middle classes. And then there's the ending, where everything's resolved, but which chooses to really procrastinate itself, and drag everything out with meaningless exposition, wearing the viewer out.The saving grace of the film, in spite of all that, is that there is a genuinely intriguing air of mystery and suspense behind what the man has been asked to do and what the motive behind it all is, and you do want to stick with it and find out what's going on. That, and there are some tasty one on one fight scenes and thrilling action sequences that really make it what it is. ***",The Commuter
28,Pjtaylor-96-138044,A few dodgy action scenes can't derail this entertaining mystery-thriller.,7,20 September 2018,"Sure, there are a couple of dodgy action scenes in 'The Commuter (2018)', including an unbelievable, CGI-fuelled final set-piece. However, none of these come close to derailing what is ultimately a consistently compelling, suitably enigmatic and surprisingly well-written mystery-thriller that focuses almost entirely on its suspenseful story as opposed to simply using it as a catalyst for over-blown, 'old-man' action (ala 'Taken 3 (2015)'). Indeed, the few fist-fights place a focus on the vulnerability of Liam Neeson's lead, usually leaving him tired and bloody. This leads to a slightly more grounded tone (which makes the aforementioned finale stand-out even further) and allows our hero to seem incredibly human. While he takes as many hits as he gives, if not more, the emphasis of the movie isn't ever really on these sequences, as I've mentioned. Instead, it stays firmly on the central situation and how the central character tries to navigate it. On the whole, the characters are actually really well drawn, with the protagonist in particular being easy to understand and care for almost instantly. This is impressive considering that most of the players are, essentially, background bit-parts that only get a few key moments to shine, instead usually blending into the background to create a rich and realistic tapestry of possible suspects. While they're never distinguished solely by stereotype and a handful are given some decent development, most - if not all - aren't fully fleshed out. I will also say that I spotted the 'big bad' the second they walked on screen, but that might be down to my experience with the genre rather than anything else and the identity of 'Prynne' wasn't something I latched onto quite so easily. On the whole, I really enjoy this piece. It has a fairly taut pace while also being generally intriguing and engaging throughout. It may not be a masterpiece and it certainly isn't unique, but it's an entertaining experience that delivers what it promises in perhaps a more character-based way than expected. 7/10",The Commuter
29,bowmanblue,Liam Neeson hits people on a train,7,22 January 2018,"I know that 'shared universes' are very popular these days with film franchises, so I'm rapidly coming to the conclusion that, along with the 'Marvel Cinematic Universe,' there's also a 'Liam Neeson Shared Universe.' In this dimension Liam Neeson just wanders from one situation where he has to fight people to rescue his family. If you're familiar with the film 'Taken' (which kind of reignited Neeson's career as an elder action hero) you'll know he's more than competent at saving the day in middle age. In that he had to rescue his daughter (and beat many people up along the way). This was followed by the inevitable sequels and some other films that were basically 'Taken,' but with a different title. 'The Commuter' is one of these. However, just because it's effectively the same movie with a different coat of paint doesn't make it bad.There's not an awful lot I can say about this film that I haven't summed up in the title - Liam Neeson hits people on a train. It's pretty much your standard action movie and by no means perfect. Whenever he's on the train (which is most of the time!) the outside world speeding by looks severely computer-generated. He gets into fights and takes punishment that would put down a Terminator, there's an attempt at adding moments that you won't see coming (and you'll definitely see them coming) and parts of the plot that just probably wouldn't happen in real life.Yes, for all its numerous faults, it actually kept me very entertained. It's not overly-long and if you're either a fan of Liam Neeson's 'Taken-type' movies, or just modern action films in general, then this is something to eat popcorn to. Seeing that Liam Neeson has now beat people up on planes and now trains, I'm guessing the logical progression for his career will be for him to find himself trapped in the back of an Uber with a terrorist at the wheel and he must fight for his survival (and most likely his family's, too). And, I'm guessing I'll probably find some enjoyment in that, too (I have low standards!).",The Commuter
30,ThomasDrufke,One Stop Ride,5,15 January 2018,"I enjoy Liam Neeson action flicks as much as the next guy, but I also prefer say a Taken, The Grey, or Unknown over such films as Taken 2 or 3. In other words, it's as simple as saying I enjoy his action outings when they are a nice mix of fun thrills with serious overtones. To me, that's when he succeeds the most. The Commuter, which is supposedly his last action film, is a less than stellar film that revolves around another unbelievably silly (but plausible for a Neeson film) situation in which the 65 year old action star can flex his abilities.The problem I had with The Commuter was that it lacks the fun that some of Neeson's previous outings had. In large part, it mirrors another train thriller from a few months ago, Murder on the Orient Express. The mystery has some interesting twists and turns, but there just isn't enough action pizazz to keep it from being forgettable within days. In fact, I saw the movie yesterday, and I'm having some trouble remembering certain plot elements.There are some solid performances among some not so good ones. Neeson, Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, Sam Neil, and Jonathan Banks do their best with a serviceable script to provide intriguing characters and plot developments that are nothing more than B-movie material. I guess that's probably the best way to describe this film, it's something that you could enjoy on a night home and scrolling through channel guide.

31,Cineanalyst,Source Code Meets the Tedium of Non-Stop,3,10 August 2018,"""The Commuter"" is about a 60-year-old man whose repetitive life is interrupted by a time-sensitive mystery on a train that threatens the lives of all the passengers aboard. He receives instructions to solve this mystery by Vera Farmiga. If I hadn't known better, I might've thought I was watching a reworking of ""Source Code"" (2011). After all, the opening credits sequence shows Liam Neeson going through the same basic routine everyday, which always results with him commuting to and from work--plus train, plus Farmiga. But, no, instead, it's ""Non-Stop"" (2014), with the same star, with the twist being he's on a train this time rather than a plane.I miss the simplicity of the ""Taken"" series and the more-acceptable logic that a former CIA operative would have ""a very particular set of skills"" that would allow him to kick butt even as he enters the age of a senior citizen. In ""Non-Stop,"" at least, he's still a federal air marshal, but, now, in ""The Commuter,"" he's a former insurance salesman and even-more-former police officer. Talk about straining credulity. Most people, including police officers, go their entire lives without ever having the athleticism and combat skills of Neeson's salesman. If they do continue this path until Neeson's character bounces out of his wheelchair without an ounce of combat training in his past careers to beat up guys half his age or younger, then I hope the plots aren't as convoluted as this one.And Farmiga is not in her mid-30s, as the police captain suggests. If audiences can accept the premise of an elderly man leaping between railroad cars like he's prime Michael Jordan, then I think they can accept that a mid-40s-aged woman is attractive.",The Commuter

However, the closer he gets to locating Prynne, the more Michael learns of the money and its mysterious owner. While there are fisticuffs to accompany the bouts of intrigue, for the most part this is pretty standard Liam Neeson fare that finds him playing the same stock tough-guy he's played for the last decade.Incidentally, after losing their job most people get under the train instead of on it.

35,The-Sarkologist,Not Your Average Ride Home,7,17 January 2018,"Well, you've been catching the same train for the past ten years of your life, so you probably have a pretty good idea of who is on that train and who isn't. Well, it seems as if that might be of use to somebody, somebody who is willing to pay you something like a hundred grand to locate somebody that actually shouldn't be on that train, and is catching the train to the last stop. Well, that narrows it down a bit, but the other catch is that you can't let on what is going on. Well, that sounds like some sort of Liam Neelson thriller, as you have probably worked out already. 
 Yeah, this film is one of those deep state corrupt government conspiracy type films, and Liam Neelson is basically having a bad day. Apparently he was sacked from his job, though from what I gathered he was made redundant. Okay, sacked is probably the better word because it sounds as if he simply wasn't able to justify his wage to his bosses anymore (though the suggestion was that it was all a set-up). As it pretty quickly turns out he wasn't always an insurance saleman, before that he was a cop, and a pretty straight one at that. I guess that is why he didn't cut it as an insurance salesman because you can't be a straight shooter and be successful at selling insurance.
 So, what we have here is your typical Liam Neelson thriller. He gets on the train and heads home, but is then approached by a stranger and asked to find this mysterious person. At first you don't really know what is going on, and since it is a thriller, the good guy/bad guy thing is a little blurry. Basically you don't know who to trust, and in fact it sounds as if the poor guy is being set up for a bit of a fall. However, what you do get is a rollicking good thriller that pretty much completely wrecks a train at the end, and of course Liam Neelson being blamed for all the bad things that are going on. 
 Once again, this isn't one of those deep thinking movies, but it isn't meant to be - it is just Liam Neelson getting into a whole lot of trouble, and managing to get himself out if it again.",The Commuter
36,paulclaassen,"Forgettable, preposterous, cliched fare.",3,5 December 2018,"In the beginning, the film has a very effective way of showing the passing of time through clever photography and editing. Unfortunately this was about as much as I enjoyed about the film. NOTHING about the plot is believable. In fact, I'd go so far as calling it preposterous. There's just so much wrong here, if I were to highlight these scenes, I'd end up talking about the entire film.If Vera Farmiga's character, Joanna, and her organisation is so technologically advanced that they can see and hear Michael (Liam Neeson) every step of the way - and his family! - why can't they find Prin themselves? Why do they need Michael? And why set up someone if they can easily erase their trace? When they allowed Michael to listen to his family, his family just happened to talk about him at that very second. Yeah, right, that's so believable...This film blatantly borrows from Non-stop, Unstoppable, Knowing, etc. that it should be considered a crime. Even the train crash scene was equally overdone as the crash scene from Super 8. When the police arrives at the train crash scene, there first reaction is to draw their guns and ask Michael to step outside. Are you friggin kiddin me!! The crash site looks like a war zone and they're not even interested in the well-being of the passengers (or hostages, as preposterous as it is). No ambulances rush to the scene?? No fire engines??? On the news they say no word of casualties... That's because no-one bothered to check yet!!This was cliche upon cliche and elevated to the point of stupidity during the final act.

37,Rodrigo_Amaro,A generic yet cool superproduct movie.,8,11 August 2020,"Yo, MacMurphy. Can I call you Mac? Jaume Collet-Serra's ""The Commuter"" is like the biggest gathering of recycled action/thriller films of all time. It's the
perfect and most unoriginal McDonalds lunch you can ever get, so either a) you know what you're getting; b) you avoid it because you know how it tastes; or
c) maybe the lunch wasn't exactly you're taste but you ate anyway just to see if something changes while chewing; with a possible d) if none of those acts apply, you're
a first timer who haven't experimented the meal (haven't seen any movies or similar to this one). My case is the option C since I've seen hundreds of films
like this and I can easily understand why some viewers will love it or hate it as the suspense unfolds, and I understand the ammount of lukewarm reviews it can
get - gotta be fair, the film is something in between. No higher expectations though except the usual fun partnership between main star Liam Neeson and director Jaume, they work well together (""Run All Night"", ""Non-Stop"") and in that regard
I wasn't disappointed. But as the story progressed I could feel the insanely ammount of borrowed elements from better movies.Neeson plays Will MacCauley a former police detective now turned into an 60-year-old insurance salesman who loses his job after a decade of dedication to a big company. On his
usual ride work/home forth and back he takes long train trips and it's in one of those things suddenly changes to the family man after a mysterious woman (Vera Farmiga)
asks for a simple help that only he can do (thanks to his previous police work), in exchange he'll get lots of money for his service which comes in handy. Mac's mission:
to track down a person who isn't a regular presence on that train all the way to the end of the line. Danger, fear and risky moments come along the way in this
super montage of ""Narrow Margin"" meets ""The Gauntlet"" meets a bunch of other movies, repeatting patterns, schemes, situations and with a restrained sense of humor (one of
the film's failure was to inject a good dose of humor, it takes itself too seriously).I'm not complaining about ""The Commuter""; I liked almost fully for being exactly like this: very predictable (at least for me, I could see the end of the line
coming and who's behind the woman's game and Mac's thrilling paranoia); a film trying to complicate things when actually they're quite simple but the writers had like
a dozen of really effective ideas that got me on the edge of the seat or elements I hadn't thought off before.And when a screenplay seems to get into a mess comes a
talented director pulling the strings to make you in expectation of what comes next; using of tricks and styles to compose his picture. Example here is the fight
scene between Mac and the first bad guy. Collet-Serra presents an one-take sequence of punches, kicks, ojects breaking or being thrown on each other. Detailed viewers
will notice the cuts in the sequence thanks to lousy special effects that ruined the scene, all easily to spot. I liked this particular moment because it's the first
time in ages a cinematographer captures a great deal of details coming from the stunt-men choreographed fight (we're able to see who's beating up who. Greengrass shaky-
camera style isn't shown here, thankfully). What ruined
the experience was the editing process that made the final bits of the fight laughable, unbelievable and you can notice where the cuts were made in the shot.
If the story is a put-down at times, the special effects are near disaster, pitiful and cheaply made - the gigantic train that never ends on the inside but it's
a tiny particle on the outside).Bottom of line ""The Commuter"" is the ultimate product movie tailored to demand people's expectations, get fine box-office results (and they did) but more about
style than substance. Neeson, Farmiga, Jonathan Banks (he was a pleasant surprise, and it's the first time I actually wanted him to be the villain),
Patrick Wilson are all good, convincing roles even when some bits don't work much. Other reason I can endorse it is that one can learn a lot with this movie,
particularly those who feel inclined to write or direct one because here you can learn what to avoid, the cliches you can or not use, elements, rhythm and timing to build
suspense and the plot twists. Not to mention you can learn the exact math formula of a big hit combined with simple elements. Just complicate it enough, give the
impression you're feeling a gigantic bunch of the audience. Not me, though since I can spot flaws, goofs and plot holes. Cool movie nonetheless. 8/10",The Commuter
38,cruise01,A thriller train ride that may be familiar with plot but still an entertaining fun ride.,6,13 January 2018,"The Commuter is a decent action thriller that brings Liam Neeson back in action in a conspiracy plot that has him trying to discover that one mystery person in a train. This is the fourth time with Liam Neeson and director Jaume Collet-Serra are working together for their fourth thriller. Sure, this film may be a little similar to Non-Stop. If you could put aside for its decent plot and enjoy Liam Neeson butt kicking action, than this film will be for you. The plot follows Michael (Liam Neeson) an insurance salesman. He wakes up every day following the same routine, dealing with every day stress with his wife, and trying to figure a way to afford there son's college. Michael takes the train every day for the last ten years. When Michael's job goes awry, letting him go. His commute home on the train, he meets a stranger Joanna (Vera Farmiga) that offers him a deal of $100,000 if he can identify a passenger that sticks out from the rest of the people before the final stop. If he fails to do it, his family lives will be in danger. What I liked about The Commuter is its decent amount of action thrills. Liam Neeson trying to solve the mystery of this offer of trying to find the one passenger from a guitar player, a nurse, a tattooed girl, a snob broker, and a school girl. What does all these strangers have in connection? Or why does Joanna want Michael to find this individual? Sure, it is a fun ride when things get rolling when the threat rises when Michael has no choice cause his family's life is on the line. Watching Liam Neeson play a character that is not much of a fighter, and an insurance agent that is getting ready for retirement. He takes a beating when fighting bad guys and gets tossed around. But he gets back up to hit back and does what he does best in taking guys down. Yes, the action picks up after the first hour, and it is a wild ride from there. There is a twist in there, when you can start wondering if the villain's motivation behind all this could have been done differently. Liam Neeson is good at what he does best as an aging action star. Vera Farmiga did well as the main villain with a mastermind plan that is setting everything in motion. Patrick Wilson was also decent as Neeson's friend and an officer. What I did not like about the film is the conspiracy plot seems familiar. A little too familiar like Liam Neeson's previous films Non-stop. Except replace the concept setting to a commuter train. And than a conspiracy plan of having Neeson's character trying to solve the mystery about this individual passenger that the bad guys want him to find. And place a tracker on their bag. Leaving the fate of the passenger a mystery.Also, it does have some entertaining action with Neeson fighting guys and throwing them around the train, smashing through windows, and a brief shoot out. But the film is consist of close up camera shots with the action and a lot of camera movement which does create a little confusion on what is going on screen. Overall, The Commuter is a fair action thriller. The concept and twist were fun. Seeing Liam Neeson being fanatic in searching for that one passenger was a lot of fun and kicking back in action. Except the plot does not deliver anything new with thrills except for similar twist with the conspiracy story. And the action is nothing worth talking about.I rate the film 3 out of 5 stars. I recommend seeing the film as a rental or unless your bored and a Liam Neeson fan that enjoyed movies like Non-stop, Run All Night, or Unknown than check it out in theatres.",The Commuter

In this film Liam Neeson plays a Insurance salesman, Michael MacCauley, who loses his job after working for his company for 10 years. With 2 mortgages to pay, and his sons college fees due, he doesn't know how to break the news to his wife, who is worried about how they are going to afford there sons fees. On his usual route back home on the train, Michael is approached by a woman, Joanna (Vera Farmiga) who offers him $25,000, and a further $75,000 if he can find Prynne, an unknown passenger, and plants a GPS on them. Out of curiosity, he goes to the location of the money, and he is surprised to find it hidden in the toilet. Michael then looks around the train for a person with a bag but with the train being so busy, he finds it hard to track the person down. After trying different methods to plant the tracker on the correct person, he decides to turn down the mission but when he finds out that his family are in danger, and the mysterious person on the phone kills another passenger, he soon realises how serious the whole situation is. As he has to find the correct person before the train gets to the end of the line, time is against him so he tries to get help from his old partner, Alex Murphy (Patrick Wilson), whose in the NYPD. When Michael finally comes face to face with the culprit, he realises that all is not what it seems, and with the police thinking that he has hijacked the train and taken the passengers hostage, he fights to prove his innocence whilst keeping the victim safe. It's not the most original storyline for this genre but the situation does become extremely intense towards the end. The action scenes, especially the train crashing scene, were well put together and Neeson plays his role well but it's nothing that we haven't seen before. With that aside, it's still worth a watch, if your in the mood to watch Neeson kickass once again but don't expect a movie spectacular. Watchable!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, who brought you House of Wax, Goal II: Living The Dream, Orphan and the Shallows. He also directed Run All Night, Non-Stop and Unknown, which all starred Liam Neeson, so they have obviously built a close relationship over the years. Although there partnership has produced some decent movies, they have all been same ol' same ol' from Neeson, which is a shame because he is a great actor in all different genres. At 65, Neeson hasn't showed any sign of slowing down in the action department and with 12 projects in the pipeline there's no stopping this money making machine.Budget: $40million
Worldwide Gross: $120millionGenre: Action, Crime, Drama
Cast: Liam Neeson, Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, Jonathan Banks, Sam Neill, Elizabeth McGovern, Killian Scott, Shazad Latif, Andy Nyman and Clara Lago. 5/10",The Commuter
42,TheMovieDiorama,The Commuter is 'Non-Stop' but on a train.,6,24 February 2018,"That sentence alone, is how everyone will describe this film. Why? Well, because it is. It's the exact same formula (with the additions of a few twists) that descends into a messy and coincidental plot. Yet, much like the other Collet-Serra and Neeson offerings, it's undeniably enjoyable. A commuter is having a bad day, and now it's about to get even worse. He must identify a passenger that ""does not belong"", once he does he will acquire $100,000. If not completed in the allotted time, well...there will be consequences. This is probably the weakest thriller that two have created together but come on...the entertainment value is too good to pass up. It details a man who has hit rock bottom, where salvaging for any money gaining opportunities is the only thing left. What would you do in that situation? The film actually explores that, both practically and hypothetically. That's pretty much the extent of the narrative. It's Neeson, walking up and down a train, judging people, investigating bags and somehow packing more action than the average thriller. These confined locations are always put to good use in getting to know the supporting characters, heck Agatha Christie knew this best. The hand combat sequences were filmed fine, however one or two scenes actually stood out. The one take fight sequence involving an axe was very effective and heightened the thrills the film desired. Collet-Serra's visual flair enhanced the aesthetic appeal, particularly the beginning where we watch the same scenario but on different days (obviously to highlight the fact he wakes up, reads with his kid and commutes to work). Neeson is dependable as ever. But, the third act goes from first to sixth gear instantly, to which I was not prepared. It's downright ludicrous and the messy execution became a detriment unfortunately. I found the twists slightly predictable and underusing Farmiga was a crime! However it's an enjoyable flick, time flew by in what was a well paced messy familiar thriller. I want Neeson on a bus next. No wait, a blimp!",The Commuter
43,pmtelefon,Who's Prynne? Who cares?,3,2 December 2018,"Even by Liam Neeson action movie standards, ""The Commuter"" stinks. The story is ridiculous. Neeson's performance is literally the same in every movie. I shouldn't complain. One of my favorites, Charles Bronson, mailed it in for ten years. But Neeson's act is wearing thin on me. The CGI was mostly unnecessary, unconvincing or both. Why did they use CGI in some of fight scenes? Why didn't they use stunt doubles like they've been doing for the last hundred years? It's much more convincing. On the plus side, I did enjoy all of the supporting cast (with the exceptions of Mr & Mrs Conjuring). Big demerit for only using Elizabeth McGovern for just a few minutes.",The Commuter
44,damianphelps,For Neeson,6,13 April 2021,"This is watchable as a Liam Neeson fan, beyond that its really not that strong a film.The premise is as stretchy as Stretch Armstrong!The acting and overall presentation of the film is ok, its really just the plot that is the issue.It gets a 6 from me as I enjoy watching the big man, but as a film its a 4 or 5.",The Commuter
45,Fella_shibby,"Although Neeson's films r more like a déjà vu, he is definitely d new king of action films.",9,31 March 2018,"The character development scene showing Neeson's humdrum existence is very well done. Also noteworthy is the amount of tension created. I found the twist predictable but there r lots of other twists and turns. It is a solid entertainment n Neeson's fans like me will not b disappointed. I hav become a fan of this director.
Jaume Collet-Serra has given some solid thrillers: House of Wax, Orphan, Unknown, Non-Stop, Run All Night and The Shallows.
And as far as Neeson is concerned he is d new king of action films.
Although he has turned into a deja vu, but it is always solid fun to c him in action n thriller films. I missed seeing this on a big screen. Saw this on a pirated hd dvd copy.",The Commuter
46,southdavid,Plain Trains and Autopilot.,5,22 January 2018,"Liam Neeson's career renaissance as an action star continues here with ""The Commuter"", a thriller that is the very definition of passable, but cleverly released in the middle of awards season to cash in as an alternative. The film reteams Neeson with director Juame Collet-Serra, the pair having worked on ""Walk Amongst The Tombstones"" and ""Unknown"" together. This time Neeson is Michael Macauley, an ex-cop who has made a meagre living selling insurance for the past decade. On the day he's fired from his job, a stranger he meets on the train home (Vera Farmiga) offers him £100,000 to identify which of the passengers is not who they are claiming to be. ""The Commuter"" is a generally a waste of time. It's highly derivative of dozens of similar films, and very predictable. Even before the train leaves Grand Central you'll already have worked out who the real villain is and perhaps even have a good idea as to why. But these flaws are perversely some of the films easiest selling points. Bland and inoffensive as though it is, you know exactly what you're going to get. The action scenes are passable, Neeson gamely sparring with the occasionally henchman. He takes more punishment than anyone would realistically be able to contend with, but that is a cliché of the genre. However, the stunts then get bigger, more computer generated and inversely less interesting. What is impressive about ""The Commuter"" is the depth of the supporting cast. Sam Neill, Patrick Wilson and Johnathan Banks all are in the film as former colleagues or fellow passengers. From a UK perspective, two more members of the cast will be of interest. Shazad Latif, whose career is on the rise with Star Trek Discovery, but who will always be Clem Fandango to me, has a small but significant role, and Andy Nyman, long time comedy writer and director has one of his first Hollywood roles that isn't a vocal only performance. ""The Commuter"" is far from essential viewing but maintains its averageness throughout and I can't believe that anyone who sees it, is going to care enough about it to hate it.",The Commuter

But because I merely expected it to be an average B-movie and lowered my expectations of any credibility of the story, this movie was still a nice way of passing the time for me.Liam Neeson gets offered a 100 thousand dollars if he finds a mysterious bag on a train. Will he find it, or will he die trying if he fails? Sounds ridiculous? It is.It is a dumb plot, resulting in a dumb movie, but somehow these Liam Neeson movies always have enough suspenseful and action packed plot turns at the right moments to keep me watching till the very end.

49,paul-allaer,"""Non Stop"" on rails: thoroughly familiar yet thoroughly enjoyable",7,12 January 2018,"""The Commuter"" (2018 release; 103 min.) brings the story of Michael McCauley. As the movie opens, we get to know Micheal as he goes about his daily routine of waking up at 6 am and getting ready to take the commuter train in Manhattan, where he works at an insurance company. Then one day, out of the blue, Michael is fired from his job, for no apparent reason and just as he needs the money to pay for his son's expensive college. Afterwards he commiserates with a buddy (and that's when we find out Michael used to be a NYC cop). On his commute train ride home, Michael gets approached by a mysterious woman who makes him an offer: identify the person who doesn't belong on the train, and get $100,000 in return. She tells him there is a $25,000 upfront payment in the bathroom. When Michael goes to check there, he can't believe it but yes, there's the money. He decides to take it. It's not long before strange things start to happen... At this point we're less than 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is, if I'm counting right, the 4th collaboration between Spanish director Jaume Collet-Serra and lead actor Liam Neeson, after ""Unknown"", ""Non Stop"", and ""Run All Night"". (Collet-Serra also directed the excellent shark-drama ""The Shallows"".) Just looking at these prior films, you know EXACTLY what you are signing up for if you decide to check out ""The Commuter"". In fact, this movie could be called ""Non Stop on Rails"". Just like that earlier movie playing out on the one air flight, much of ""The Commuter"" plays out on the one commuter train ride back to suburban NYC. If this sounds like like a negative, you might be wrong, as I was on the edge of my seat trying to figure out what the heck was going on (in the best possible way). One-time 'serious' actor Liam Neeson's transformation into one of the best and most reliable action movie stars is absolutely remarkable. He brings a certain weight and charisma into these roles that not a lot of action movie stars have. Keep an eye out for an all-too-rare sighting of Elizabeth McGovern (as Neeson'swife). Sam Neil has a small role as the Police Captain. Vera Farmiga is her usual great in the small role of the mysterious woman. But in the end, this is of course the Liam Neeson show all the way. ""The Commuter"" opened wide this weekend. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was not attended very well, and surely the inclement weather here in Cincinnati was a large factor in that. I was in the mood for something to entertain me, and ""The Commuter"" was just what the doctor ordered: thoroughly familiar, yet thoroughly enjoyable too. If you are a fan of Liam Neeson's action movies, you cannot go wrong with this one. ""The Commuter"" is a WINNER.",The Commuter
50,jtindahouse,Changes the Neeson formula up and it works a treat,9,31 March 2018,"I've complained in the past that all of Liam Neeson's films are beginning to become interchangeable. They are basically the same story, with him playing the same character over and over and over. Now, while 'The Commuter' isn't worlds apart from the usual formula, it is different enough and fresh enough for me to call it his best film since 'Taken' ten years ago.The best element the film had going for it was the air of mystery it possesses. The film is a 'whodunnit' of sorts, perhaps not in your traditional sense, but it's there nonetheless. And the arc of that leading up to the reveal is well crafted. It had me fooled at least. The film also has a great cast outside of Neeson. To me it is a collection of underrated actors, actors who are terrific at what they do but don't always get the plaudits they deserve. Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, Jonathan Banks and Sam Neill all fall into this category. There isn't a lot of humour in the film but when it does come along it is surprisingly effective. The pacing is also top draw. Once the action begins it doesn't stop and this makes the run time fly by. Ten years on from 'Taken' and it's fair to say Neeson still has the goods. Here's to the next ten.",The Commuter
51,billcr12,Liam is reason to watch,7,4 April 2018,"Liam Neeson is the main reason to watch this action packed thriller. It was filmed partially along the Hudson River train lines not far from where I live in Westchester County. Liam is an ex-cop who has been selling life insurance for ten years. He rides the train every day while reading classic novels to kill the boredom. Of course, the daily routine changes one fine day as he becomes involved in a death defying mystery where he has to find a witness in a large scale cover up before he reaches the end of the line. Along the way, Liam delivers his lines in his usual, caustic manner. The big Irishman is the reason to watch The Commuter.",The Commuter

An enjoyable film that proves to be a good action film and also a good mystery, where just when you thought you know how it's gonna go, and soon throws you a curb.

This is a Liam Neeson action movie that is directed by Jaume Collet_Serra, whose name may be unfamiliar to you but he also directed The Shallows, Run All Night, Non_Stop and Unknown-All of them except The Shallows starred Liam so I guess either Liam was busy or he didn't want to wear a bikini. Anyway, here, Liam plays a former cop turned life insurance salesman that is married and has a college age son. Liam rides the same train to work every day-as he has for the last 10 years-but he gets laid off his job, just 5 years short of his retirement. No severance pay, his mortgage is due and his son is getting ready for college, Liam boards his train, trying to decide how to tell his wife when he gets home. That's when a mysterious woman, Vera, approaches him with a proposition; since Liam knows most of the people on his train-the regulars-she tells him that there is someone on the train that does not belong-not a regular-and if Liam can find the person, Vera will give him $100,000. Of course, there is more going on than she is telling him and Liam is in for a wild ride. Patrick plays Liam's old police partner and Jonathan is one of the regulars on the train.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for intense action/violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 44 minutes.

55,alindsay-al,An average action film with very few surprises,5,6 February 2018,"So here we are again another Liam neeson action film involving a mode of transport, this time it's a train and I have seen the commuter and this is just a very average movie. The premise of the film sees a businessman forced to take up a manhunt on a train. Liam Neeson is a great actor, but has got very typecast in this role of the older action start but bit really still works for this film. He is easily the best part of this film and he still sells this likeable older tough guy very well and he can continue doing it in my opinion. But the rest of the cast are pretty poor, Sam Neil, Vera farmiga and Patrick Wilson have smaller roles in this film and they 're all as cliche as you would expect with none of them standing out in any way whatsoever. All of the suspects on the train are pretty bland characters that don't particularly feel very real or interesting at all. The story does a good job in making you root for this out of luck run down good guy and really feel for him in the situation he has been put in. But my goodness this has one of the most headshaking, confusing plots I have ever seen that is so contrived that I actually felt insulted by it in the end and feel that even non stop made more sense then this. The script has some real serious drama in it and for the most part it comes across well, however, this film tries the occasional bit of humour and it just doesn't really work very well and doesn't fit well with the rest of the film. The style of the film has some decent suspenseful scenes in it and at times had me questioning what was going on, but the action scenes and set pieces were just nonsense. One action scene in particular has so much green screen that it is totally laughable and it doesn't come across well at all. Overall the commuter is a very forgettable film that isn't really worth a watch, watch the first taken film or run all night they are superior film's to this.",The Commuter

59,lukem-52760,ANOTHER EXCELLENT NEESON MYSTERY THRILLER,8,21 April 2020,"The Commuter is another Classy slick Mystery Thriller from director & actor team, Jaume Collet-Serra & Liam Neeson. Neeson has made four excellent Thrillers with this director with Unknown, Non-stop, Run All Night & The Commuter, all great films. Here Neeson is grizzled & again but also he's very thin & gaunt looking which i suppose is down to ageing as he's alot older now but it was hard to see him looking frail here at first but anyway he makes a good average joe type lead as an insurance salesman who is about to have the worst day of his life!!!
Neeson plays Mike a man who lives the ordinary middle-class life & travels back & forth on his usual train but one day it all changes from the ordinary to a game of life & death aboard the train. This Mystery Thriller plays out very similar to his earlier hit ""Non-Stop"" where he's running about trying to solve a mystery & this time it's about finding someone on the train who doesn't belong there & find what's in their bag. The stunningly beautiful Vera Farmiga (The Departed, The Conjuring films) stars as a mysterious lady who sets up the game of find the person & win alot of money, Neeson's Down-on-his-luck Mike (Who just lost his job) needs the cash but doesn't realise how deadly this is until his family are held hostage. We also have the great Sam Neill (Jurassic Park,Memoirs of an invisible man) as a Police Captain & also Patrick Wilson (The Conjuring films, Aquaman) stars as a Cop friend of Mikes & the always good Jonathan Banks (Bullet, FreeJack) a nice solid cast of good talent & a nice claustrophobic feel to the film & lots of intense & suspenseful scenes as well as some Awesome fight sequences & a big expensive c.g.i blast of ""Train action"" later on that does look ridiculously fake but in a fun popcorn Action Thriller way so it's all good.
This is an enjoyable ride of Mystery & action with a fun B-movie vibe to it all & a good solid Performance from Neeson again.The Commuter is another great fun Action packed Thriller from the ageing grizzled action hero Neeson.
Good entertainment & good fun.",The Commuter
60,kluseba,A perfectly executed routine job,8,1 February 2018,"The Commuter is another movie with Liam Neeson being Liam Neeson. This time, he plays a family father who loses his job and is about to lose everything he has. On his train ride back home, he gets approached by a woman who offers him twenty-five thousand dollars if he does her a favor. As soon as the desperate man takes the money, all hell breaks loose. He is supposed to find and eliminate a witness to a crime on the train or else his family will be in danger.Even though we have all watched similar movies before like Non-Stop, also involving Liam Neeson, that had a very similar story but took place on a plane, The Commuter is one of the most entertaining movies of its kind. It takes the time to introduce the main character and how his organized everyday life shatters from one day to another which makes us empathize and even identify with the character. The plot is mysterious and tense, as more and more details about the background story emerge step by step to keep viewers focused from start to finish. Additional story elements add a few doses of energy at the right moments and even though the solution to it all isn't that hard to figure out, you still keep guessing until the end how it might all turn out.The movie obviously has a very special atmosphere, since more than three quarters of it take place on a train, in a closed environment, with a set of diversified characters. I have always liked the idea of movies, novels and theater plays based upon this idea and it's very well executed here.The special effects aren't overused which gives the movie an almost realistic touch which gets the viewers emotionally involved. Only the final twenty minutes or so are filled with spectacular action, leading to an appropriate showdown and its aftermath.The decent soundtrack complements the movie's gloomy atmosphere. The lighting techniques add a sinister tone as well. The at times claustrophobic camera angles are employed accurately. The makers of this movie clearly knew what they were doing.Even though The Commuter isn't a particularly original movie, it's a great ride and entertaining from start to finish.

61,3xHCCH,Another Frenetic Neeson Flick,7,11 January 2018,"Michael McCauley is a 60-year old insurance salesman who was just laid off from his job. On his way home on the train (the same train he had been taking everyday going to work for the past ten years), a mysterious woman named Joanna (Vera Farmiga) offered him $100,000 if he could use his skills as an ex-NYPD cop to seek out a specific passenger with a bag and put a GPS device on him before gets off at the Cold Spring station. If McCauley failed at this task, his family will be killed. With a synopsis like that, you can already imagine how tense and claustrophobic this action-thriller was going to be. The travel time from Grand Central Station in the heart of NYC to the Cold Spring station (a distance of 85 km) on the Metro North Railroad via the Hudson line is about an hour and 20 minutes only in real life. I liked the opening montage showing the day-to-day domestic life of Michael McCauley, his wife Karen (Elizabeth McGovern) and son Danny (Dean-Charles Chapman) and his daily train ride into the city. I thought this sequence so eloquently conveyed their routine with the passage of time and seasons. I liked that Michael read the classic books Danny needed to read for school -- something I also do with my kids. Oftentimes, we pay no mind to the scenes with the opening credits, but this one certainly grabbed my attention from the start.Despite the sheer impossibility of what was being asked of him, you know that Liam Neeson will do whatever it takes to save his family. Of course, his trademark invincibility and other super-human abilities will come in pretty handy, like they conveniently did in his previous action flicks. Honestly, he had to look for a needle in a veritable haystack in this one. No one can do that crazy task given the nebulous clues, extreme time limits and the hundreds of people on that train. But hey, he's Liam Neeson.We suspend our disbelief as we go with the quick pacing of the action. No matter how contrived the situations may be, we are sucked into the flow of the story all the way to its slam-bang super-explosive climax. Tightly shot, bone-crunching fight scenes between McCauley and various suspects escalate the excitement along the way. Astute viewers may be able to guess how things are going to wind up at the end, but director Jaume Collet-Serra (who had directed Neeson twice before) knew exactly how to keep us hooked. 7/10.",The Commuter

63,TdSmth5,Give me a break,3,11 April 2018,"So here we have yet another action movie teaming wanna-be-director Jaime Sierra and Liam Neeson. This time on a train. Liam is your ordinary former cop-turned life insurance salesman. He's a got a kid about to go to college and is paying two mortgages. On this day he gets fired but chooses not to tell the wife. He meets up with his former cop partner for some drinks then boards his usual train the one he's been riding for years. Other regulars know him. A strange woman sits in front of him and makes conversation. She claims to be a therapist and wants to do an exercise with Liam. Would he do a single thing that would be a no big deal for him but a huge deal for someone else? When she unpacks this it involves him finding someone on the train named Prynne who has a bag on him and who will exit at such-and-such station. Liam just has to put a tracker in this person's bag. And in return he will get 100K. If he goes to the restroom and takes 25K hidden there that means he has accepted the job. So he goes to the restroom and indeed finds and takes the money, after all he has no job now. By now the woman is gone. At first he's reluctant of course, but he's being watched somehow at all times and when at another station someone hands him an envelope with his wife's wedding ring, he's left with no choice. He also lost his phone that day but uses someone else's phone to alert his cop friend. But the woman also calls him and threatens the family. So now finally he gets serious about the job and looks at the ticket stubs punched for that particular station and discounts the known travelers. That leaves him with a couple of strangers. Soon he's fighting with one of them and kills him. Turns out he was an FBI agent.Little by little it's revealed what all this is about. Some city-official committed suicide the day before but it was actually a mob hit. And Prynne witnessed the murder. For some reason the FBI decides to put her on this train so that at the so-and-so station he can meet with FBI agents. And the woman and the people she works for want to take him out of course. The woman assures Liam that she's got people everywhere, in politics, in law enforcement. The corruption goes very deep and there's little Liam can do about it. After risking his life some more and some more fights, the train derails of course leaving yet all the key people unharmed. Now the wagon is surrounded by SWAT, cops, FBI and everyone else with a gun, because it looks like Liam is holding everyone hostage with a gun. The cop friend boards the wagon to try and talk Liam into letting everyone go and turning himself in peacefully. At that point some more things are revealed.As I'm telling the story it would appear to make sense but in the movie itself little does. Everything is utterly exaggerated to the point of being absurd, everything is over the top in a bad way, there's countless of nonsensical parts, ridiculous coincidences, and plenty of plot holes. The movie is too long, the piano music too dramatic and completely out of place. Direction as expected is a mess. Neeson is past the age of doing these kind of movies. Surely there must be some 40 or 50 year old actor to replace him. But I guess they won't let Neeson retire or take on some other kind of role. This movie was just way to silly for me, not even a teenager would buy half of the stuff that happens here. But the premise itself is interesting and with some better screenwriters, director and a different lead, this movie could have worked. Florence Pugh looks gorgeous in her small role. For all the incompetence overall, surprisingly, whoever directed the fighting scenes did a solid job and these scenes provide something worthwhile to see.",The Commuter

and you don't deserve it.
But the reality is sometimes
soldiers end up casualties.Do you want to know what I still remember from ""The Commuter""? Well, actually it's not that much anymore. It's that kind of movie. Only the opening scene where you see Michael MacCauley (Liam Neeson) performing his recurring morning ritual. From getting up to the ride to the metro station with his wife. A unique piece of film? Or is it a copy of the opening scene from ""Rebirth"" where you see the protagonist performing his daily morning activities as well? A way to demonstrate the daily grind of working people. Only Michael's daily pattern is being discontinued in a rather harsh way when he's being fired at work, where he has been selling life insurances for over 10 years, at the age of 60. And after that, there's this unknown beautiful woman (Vera Farmiga) who makes a hypothetical proposal. He has to take a bag from another traveler on the metro in order to protect himself and his family from a financial catastrophe. Sounds simple but essentially it's a task that should not be underestimated.It seems as though Neeson got a patent on this type of film where he has to work against the clock to complete a task, commissioned by unscrupulous criminals. And time and again it is his family that is also threatened. ""The Commuter"" is a bit ""Non-Stop"" and a cross-section of all the ""Taken"" episodes. And this time it takes place on a train. But to be honest, at a certain moment I thought it was enormously exaggerated and implausible. For a movie night where you can turn off your brains for a while, such that they can enjoy a well-deserved rest, and you can gorge on homemade popcorn, this film isn't that awful. But dear Mr. Neeson. Isn't it time to take a different road and diversify your work a bit? Don't be tempted always to play in the same kind of movies with just a different environment and set-up? After all, you aren't getting any younger. Right?",The Commuter
65,valleyjohn,Silly stuff!,5,6 March 2020,"You've got to love a Liam Neeson action movie . He's carved out new career as a bad ass and for the best part we've all enjoy the ride- but not this ride ...Neeson is Michael, an insurance salesman, whose daily commute home quickly becomes anything but routine. After being confronted by a mysterious stranger , He is blackmailed into finding the identity of a passenger on his train before the last stop.There is a line in the sand where a film starts off being entertaining and turns into the ridiculous and 45 minutes into this that line is quite firmly crossed .
To say the plot is silly is an understatement and it's not helped by some awful fight scenes that feel like they have been speeded up and some shockingly bad CGI .The plot holes are so big that the train they are riding on could use them as a tunnel !
It's a shame because it had lots of potential as well as a really good cast but sadly the director has made a dogs dinner of a movie .The one good thing I can see is I was never bored but that's not enough for me .",The Commuter

67,AudioFileZ,See Only If You Like Stupid Conspiracy Crime Movies With Liam Neeson,5,21 January 2018,"If you're going to roll out Liam Neeson once more as the everyman terminator I guess you'll get a certain built-in audience which seems proven. What's the setup this time? Ahh, a aged man suddenly in a particularly vunerable state fighting for his family's safety usually makes one...check. Badguys who give you a mission you must complete to save your family to which you aren't sure who the badguys actually are...check. And everything important occurs on a train. Ahem, that's a blend of something akin to Hitchcock meets a bit of action. This could be interesting if the story line is perhaps?The Commuter takes a spotty murderous game and seeks to throw in enough reality with mysterious complications forgetting to question how ridiculous the actual game is. Since the baddies seem to know enough to assinate their target we're suppose to believe they need to preposturously manipulate Neeson's character instead. But why? The whole idea seems needlessly contrived.After watching the film I felt like the only reason I watched was to make more sense of something so wrong. Neeson plays the role with the right degree of desparation alright as he seems like a doomed ping-pong ball in his search for his target. He seems both on the edge as well as determined, with little chance of success. Of course we already know we must have him not fail and that waters an already confusing silly story.If Liam Neeson couldn't play this role so well this film would be, well, needless in most every regard. Admittedly there is something to seeing him constantly being a hair from disaster yet hanging on that is compelling. It doesn't really make any sense however and the ending feels totally as an ""Hail Mary"" attempt to tidy it all up. I really can't recommend it as sush.",The Commuter

69,rgkarim,Riding the Train To Mystery and Drama,7,13 January 2018,"Liam Neeson, a legend among the action/dram genre ever since Taken premiered years ago. Despite his best attempts, Neeson cannot seem to escape his typical role, and you know what... fans don't really seem to care. Fortunately, there has been some time lapse since his last escapade, but this weekend he is back in yet another intense movie called The Commuter. Looking to reprise his role once more, can this film triumph, or will it be just another copycat to be lost to the weekend. Robbie K is back with another review and also always thank you for reading. Let's go!LIKES:Mystery: A good mystery always suckers me into a movie and the Commuter has a hum dinger of one to solve. Upon entering the train and meeting Vera Farmiga, Neeson's character is dropped into the mystery with clues abound to choose from. One will have to pay strong attention to the details and dialogue to figure out all the answers, especially with many curve balls thrown in to try and lead you astray. That grand question of who done it, is the focal point of this entire movie, and the key factor to keeping you hooked in the movie. The Suspense: Of course a mystery can only go so far to keeping your interest. The Commuter has your back again on this, by keeping suspense intertwined with the mystery. Primarily through the pace, the Commuter moves at a fast pace to get you to the answers, taking only a few pit stops along the way to introduce a new dynamic into the mix. For once, I can't say there were any major scenes not needed, and with this storytelling, the intensity only deepened. Then come the actual threats and obstacles that further enrich the story, providing a little more depth to the usual plot that builds the intensity of the case, and keeping things relevant to the story. Add the finishing touches of dynamic cinematography with major sound editing and you've got yourself the successful recipe of another drama. The Climax: With all the epic build up promised in this movie, one only hopes the climax is able to meet the demands of the film. Fortunately, this film did not fail to please me with the ending at hand. Keeping with the energy of the film, the finale amped up the intensity with action, emotion, and a few twists to finally answer all the questions at hand. While there was a little convenient moment, the ending manages to bring everything together and leave you feeling fulfilled with true closure and what we can hope leaves no grounds for a sequel. DISLIKES:The Opening: While the Commuter gets to the suspense quickly, I can't say I enjoyed the rushed opening the film started with. A rushed montage that gave you brief glimpses into the life of Neeson's character clearly spell his life out, perhaps going a little too detailed in all aspects of his life. Ironically this approach left me a little bored and cheated of meaningful relationships with his family, you know the motivation for solving the crime, leaving me feeling he was the only one invested in the relationship. They even failed to show his family being kidnapped, and depriving of us the full emotional scale that we got with Taken. I do appreciate trying to get to the goods as soon as possible, but one must make sure to give that character some depth before testing them. Trailer Syndrome: Sadly, The Commuter suffers from the trailers giving a majority of the story away. While not all secrets are revealed, enough twists are shown in the brief 3 minute promotions to help you piece the movie together before it's even started. As if that weren't bad enough, one also can see those obstacles coming a mile away, making the movie become a bit more predictable and less intense. As it is the suspense and mystery that are key to getting the most out of this movie. If you avoid the trailers or are able to drop it out of their minds, no worries, but if you remember these like I do...get ready to be very familiar with these scenes. Semi-Rushed suspects: In movies like clue, and the original murder on the orient express, one become quite engaged in the stories of the those under suspect. However, The Commuter's cast are only semi-expanded upon in this movie and often in misbalanced proportions. Based on how often a character is used can certainly give you hints to their involvement, but these secondary characters are not well-integrated into the movie at times outside of some comedic relief. Sure, you get enough of their story to piece their struggles, but there was much more to be had. The VERDICT: The Commuter is a movie that I quite enjoyed, and is a welcome opening to what will most likely be more Neeson led dramas in the future. A strong mystery ties the action, suspense, and drama into a neat little package that builds up in intensity until the exciting climax emerges to wrap things up. Sadly, there are some editing tactics and semi-rushed development choices that take away from the character Neeson plays. Why they won't expand on his character and give him more depth I can't answer, but it would have been a plus if they had given him a little more to work with so he wouldn't be just another Taken knock off. Still, so long as you avoid the trailers, this movie is worth a trip to the local theater to entertain and tease your brain. My scores are: Action/Crime/Drama: 7.5 
Movie Overall: 6.5LIKES:--Mystery
--Suspense
--ClimaxDISLIKES:--The Opening
--Trailer Syndrome
--Semi-Rushed Suspects. The Commuter succeeds in providing you your Liam Neeson film fix for the next few months. While not an entirely remake of Taken, this film certainly has many similarities that take away from the uniqueness, but will please you. It has suspense and mystery to sweeten the pot, entangle with enough dramatic obstructions to try to deter him from uncovering the truth. Throughout the movie, one will certainly feel the intensity of the movie building, which is answered in spades by the incredible climax. Things will come full circle by the end of the film and the excitement will continue until near the last 10 minutes of the movie, which is something I can get on board with. 
 Sadly, this fast paced approach led to a b perhaps semi-rushed montage that added little to the film outside of quickly establishing his baseline. In addition, this approach crafted Neeson's character to be a bit shallower and boring in his quest to find the answers left bin that era. But when not concerned with the opening, the semi-rushed suspects and trailer syndrome will let you down and ruin many surprises that his movie needs to keep engaging. So bottom line for this is to avoid watching trailers for like the next two months. 
 Despite these areas of improvement though, The Commuter accomplishes it's goals and awaits further viewing by the public. I would recommend seeing this one due to all the mystery/music that graces it. If you decide to wait, please check out RedBox asap to enjoy this movie. My scores are:

70,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of The Commuter,5,13 January 2018,"It's January at the movie theaters and you know what that means. It means that it's Neeson time. Liam Neeson that is. He's the 65-year-old badass. He's the Buddha everyman. He's the AARP butt-kicker. He's well, the most reliable actor on the planet. Neeson is perfectly cast in The Commuter despite the negative review I'm about to give it. He's an expert at playing the nice guy, retired cop whom the bad dudes choose to mess with. ""Commuter"" is also Liam's umpteenth showcase pic and his fourth collaboration with Spanish helmer, Jaume Collet-Serra. Neeson is Collet-Serra's unquieted muse and I liked their films Run All Night and Non-Stop. With The Commuter, they've unfortunately run into a misstep. This is an expendable, far-fetched redux that fumbles its way to a formidable ""destination"".I will say this though. If you ride the Metra train to work (like my best friend does in Chi-Town), you might still think twice after getting a whiff of The Commuter's ransack, persecution complex. ""Commuter"", which is distributed by the long running production company StudioCanal, is almost identical to Collet-Serra's 2014 vehicle, Non-Stop (mentioned in the 2nd paragraph). The only difference is that The Commuter takes place on a fast-moving train as opposed to the nominal, friendly skies. In truth, you could call ""Commuter"" mindlessly Hitchcockian (as some critics have). For me, it could only be labeled Hitchcockian if it was channeled on the veritable Redbox tip. Anyway, Jaume Collet-Serra is one of the most efficient, thriller directors out there. He knows how to produce beautiful, streamlined camerawork and his flicks are always tension-filled and twisty. With ""Commuter"" however, the execution is sloppy this time around. The obligatory tension is there but the editing and plausibility factor are hackwork at best. Also, ""Commuter's"" fistfight scenes are badly choreographed and its conclusion feels anti-climatic with the makings of a Hollywood cop out.In retrospect, you should see The Commuter for Neeson alone but know that Oskar Schindler and Collet-Serra have had better days. ""Commuter"" thanklessly adds co-stars Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson. Sadly, their roles as villain and would-be villain (spoiler) are too vague to examine. Rating: 2 stars.",The Commuter
71,rannynm,A Fun Thriller With Excellent Acting And Camerawork,7,19 January 2018,"The Commuter is a fun thriller, even if it does get a little too over-the-top for its own good. The acting and camerawork provide a tense feel to this movie, like many Hitchcock films. This is sure to please Liam Neeson fans.The story follows insurance salesman Michael (Liam Neeson), who is caught in a criminal conspiracy on his daily commute. Michael meets the enigmatic Joanna (Vera Farmiga), who will give him a large sum of money if he finds a passenger with evidence against her. This must be done before a certain train stop. This leads to a frenetic chase to find the passenger, as elements of the conspiracy are revealed. Michael happens to be an ex-cop and will do anything to protect this passenger, but this comes with consequences.Liam Neeson, as Michael, excellently presents his frantic need to find the passenger because every wrong move can result in an innocent passenger getting caught in the crossfire. He is spectacular in the fast-paced action and stunts. Vera Farmiga as Joanna, is my favorite character because of the intense threat and urgency she provides with her performance. It is also interesting to find out more about her conspiracy. Patrick Wilson, as Alex, is an incredible helper to Michael, but you can tell he has some secrets he's not sharing. Jonathan Banks, as Walt, presents a friend to Michael who commutes with him every day, while also helping him out.Jaume Collet-Sera wonderfully directs this film with a rapid pace and you feel you are a part of the train. My favorite scene is a one-shot fight scene on board the train, because of its impressive camera work. I also like how intense it is, due to the crowded environment. My only problem with this film is that, while the main story is extremely interesting, there are many over-the-top scenarios, which turn the movie into unintentional comedy. Also, some of the filming and editing feels rushed in places.The message of the movie is that doing the right thing will never be easy, but could result in the lives of many being saved. Despite his good intentions, Michael is put into one risky situation after another and he always must risk his life. However, he saves many through his selfless acts. I give this film 3.5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18, because of its intense action and language. Reviewed by Arjun N., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",The Commuter
72,Kingslaay,Great action thriller,8,26 January 2018,"This was a great film that got better as went on. You could the intensity grow as Liam Neeson (Mike) had to find out who the secret passenger was and why. The vagueness and mystery coupled by some great action scenes made for an enjoyable film. A good cast, strong performances and interesting story to weave it together. I would not listen to the reviews and silly ratings. I would make up my own mind and watch this movie fresh.

73,vengeance20,Action-Packed Thrill Ride!,8,23 January 2018,"Knew this was going to be a good film when I seen trailers of it last year & was after watching!The film is about a 60 year man named Micheal who has been traveling on the commuter train for 10 years. One day he loses his job & finds himself back home on the train. He then meets a woman named Joanna, who tells him there's a person (with a suspicious looking bag) who doesn't belong on the train & tells him there's a reward of £25,000 hidden in the bathroom on the train. But he has to decide who it is that doesn't belong before the next stop, or else his wife & son will die. Micheal is then thrust into a twisted game of whodunit, as he tries to figure out the strange mystery...!The film was great! Suspenseful, packed with pulse racing action & simply a great edge of your seat thriller!The story-line & twist was good! I like the pacing of the film & how it had the Scream/Non Stop like theme to it, the whodunit theme in short! It kept you guessing throughout who it was & why Micheal was being targeted. The action scenes were top notch! The fight scenes & explosions were shot with pure epicness! The derailment scene was insane!Although the film did drag a tony little bit, I have little to no bad things to say about this film! It's awesome & Liam Neeson is a great actor! You'll also love Non-Stop too! It has the same type of theme to it & keeps you guessing till the end!Overall, 8/10 Go watch this film!",The Commuter

76,bkrauser-81-311064,Leaves the Station without a Train of Thought,6,19 January 2018,"In the realm of bruising, brawling, nay unstoppable a**-kickers, no rise is as unexpected and as unprecedented as that of Liam Neeson's. The man is 65-years-old and has worked on an incredible diversity of films, from gritty historical epics to talkie Woody Allen romantic dramas. But with 2008's Taken, Neeson took a hard dive into action and the world hasn't looked back since.Ten years after that franchise has remorsefully petered out, Neeson still turns in the goods every once in a while, with middle of the road action movies, middle of the road budgets and middle of the road returns. It's a living - I certainly don't fault the man who is pretty much getting paid to stay in shape. Plus every once in awhile, a middle of the road action movie is really all you need to stave off all the badness in this world.The Commuter is one such film. It's modest in its presentation and definitely falls to pieces under scrutiny but it nevertheless works because it knows what it is. It's the story of a seemingly ordinary New Yorker who ensnares himself in a criminal conspiracy on his way home from work. Luckily this man, one Michael MacCauley (Neeson), has a ""certain set of skills"" that will ultimately determine whether he lives or dies by the time the train reaches its final destination.The film was directed by frequent Neeson collaborator Jaume Collet-Serra who over the last decade has been a part of the best of Neeson's late-career work. With Neeson and Collet-Serra jointly you can expect a quick pace even tone, a good setup and a couple of action sequences that elevate the film above the field of a Van Damme knockoffs. You can also expect diminishing returns but more on that later.Part of The Commuter's nut-and-bolts appeal is it's sparse to a fault. We're put into our protagonist's headspace nearly the entire time, leaving only for a brief insert here and there. Michael is in search of a passenger on the train and needs to discover their whereabouts quietly. When who, what, where and why, in short, the details, remain scant keeping the audience transfixed on what is occurring. It's mystery box filmmaking at its finest.Of course after you've meticulously setup your premise and created the max level of tension, then you have to...you know answer the who, what, when and why. To that end The Commuter derails with the force of a backyard axe kick with villains who neither need to be this flamboyant nor this dramatic. For me, my suspension of disbelief snapped back the moment we get a cutaway of two FBI agents puttering around the last stop. But if you're the type of person who'd willingly set your house on fire to kill a spider then you're probably willing to forgive most of this film's baked in nuttiness.The movie is also hacked to s**t with editing choices that completely eschew any hope of any B-story. That normally wouldn't be such a problem if it wasn't immediately clear all that stuff was supposed to be there to begin with. For example, minor characters are enshrined in the last act with a working-class dignity reminiscent of the rebel slaves of Spartacus (1960), but absolutely nothing comes before it to ground us in whom they are. It's the equivalent of starting a children's storybook with the message on the last page being read first. Also, not for nothing but if you're going to directly reference an objectively great movie; please make sure your movie reaches at least a level of competence that you can find in a Harold Becker movie - just saying.",The Commuter
77,moviexclusive,"Part Hitchcockian whodunnit and part white-knuckle thrills, 'The Commuter' overcomes what it lacks in logic with well-executed suspense and action",7,10 January 2018,"Hard to believe that it has been 10 years since Liam Neeson became an unexpected action star with the lean, spare but brutally effective thriller 'Taken', and in the decade that's passed cemented his late renaissance with well-executed B-movie fare like 'The A-Team', 'The Grey', 'Unknown', 'Non-Stop' and 'Run All Night'. The last three were also notable for being collaborations with director Jaume Collet-Serra, and the now 65-year-old has extended their team-up with 'The Commuter', which sees Serra further lay claim to a modern-day Alfred Hitchcock with a couple of high-wire scenes that would certainly make the latter proud.As with before, there is a high-concept scenario at the heart of this deliberately old-fashioned thriller: an everyday insurance salesman Michael McCauley (Neeson) finds his routine evening commute back home from work disrupted by the enigmatic stranger Joanna (Vera Farmiga), who sits opposite him on the Metro-North train and offers him a hefty financial reward if he is able to spot someone on the train who isn't a familiar face. In order for Michael to be tempted in the first place, first-time screenwriters Byron Willinger and Philip de Blasi set him up to lose his job on that same day, leaving him floundering over his two mortgages as well as tuition fees for his college-bound son - although because this is Neeson we're talking about, you know Michael will eventually do the right, honorable and even heroic thing.To up the ante, Michael is only given slightly more than half an hour before the train reaches Cold Spring to find the individual he is told later on goes by the name of Prynne; and to raise the stakes, it turns out that Joanna has also held his wife and son hostage, both of whom she threatens to kill if Michael fails to complete his mission. True to his Hitchcockian ambition, Serra spins an intriguing web of mystery over most of the middle act, and there are at least three riveting questions that are teased. Who is Prynne? Who is Joanna and/or the people she is working with or for? And finally, what does Joanna want with Prynne? These in turn translate into solid character work for the proverbial strangers on the train whom Michael probes to locate his mark - among them a feisty college student (Florence Pugh), an arrogant Wall Street banker (Shazad Latif), an emotionally distraught nurse (Clara Lago), a tattooed bruiser (Roland Moller) and a taciturn teenager (Ella-Rae Smith).Yet Serra is all too aware that a whodunnit in and of itself is unlikely to satiate a good proportion of his audience, who are here to watch Neeson engage in the sort of close-quarter fisticuffs a la 'Taken'. So in between playing detective, Michael also gets a couple of well-choregraphed brawls - one of them takes place in the confines between carriages, while another that is impressively done in a single take plays out over an entire carriage with everything from a gun, an ax, a guitar and seat cushions used as weapons. There is visibly concerted effort to keep these fight sequences real, so even though Neeson's character is revealed earlier on to be an ex-cop, the film doesn't (thankfully) use that as an excuse to gift him with ""a very particular set of skills"" to take down his opponents too easily, skilfully or neatly.Like other locomotive-set thrillers, this one doesn't escape without the train in question going out of control and then literally off the rails. That it is well-staged is undeniable - not even some subpar CGI in some shots can detract from the sheer white-knuckle tension of seeing almost the whole train flip into the air - but this spectacle-fuelled conclusion arguably strains the credibility of the high-concept movie even further, and is therefore both better and worse off for it. Notwithstanding, Neeson remains through and through the film's emotional centre, conveying the frustration, helplessness and resolve of a regular guy who is trying to get his life back in control from those that have snatched it away from him. Lest we forget, this is a role that the thespian can easily do in his sleep, but Neeson still brings his considerable gravitas to bear.Mind you, not all the gaps in the narrative will be filled in by the end (which seems to set up the possibility of a sequel) nor will some of the explanations pass muster under closer scrutiny. Still, a film like this isn't meant to be held up under such examination or intended to offer any more than solid B-movie guilty pleasures; on the latter count though, it does succeed brilliantly and beautifully by mixing classic Hitchcockian tension with adrenaline-pumping action. We dare say that it ranks among one of Neeson's best in his action oeuvre, and if you're in the mood for some pulpy thrills and suspense, then you'll definitely want to get on this train.",The Commuter

Liam Neeson gives a strong performance as an innocent daily commuter under the cosh, and we have empathy for his character. Vera Farmiga makes a fine cold-blooded femme fatale with comparatively little screen time. There is an interesting backstory before it gets to the heart of the action. The exposition is done efficiently too, though clearly the director was keen to get on with things but the action is spoiled by frenetic editing. As it speeds along, there is very little left to surprise, and there are plot holes, the most trivial of which is that a middle aged man after three or four beers would not be able to think so cogently, especially for a man in so much danger. He would be incapable of withstanding the kind of ridiculous brutality meted out on him. The story is in such a hurry that we are not left with meaningful characters, and it is too convoluted to be a serious thriller, though it has a tense feel and is very watchable.",The Commuter

In my opinion, that's also where the movie has its strongest moments, in the element of mystery and the attempt to find the special passanger through logic and intelligence. Of course in such a film, especially considering the cast, you have to expect some action scenes as well but they rather disturbed me. Even if Liam Neeson is portrayed as an ex-cop here, I find it hard to believe that some guy who sat behind his desk for the past twenty years just loses it and shows the fighting skills of a martial arts fighter. There are also some logical errors, which is disappointing but not too disturbing for the general plot.All in all this is a decent movie, but it should have put more focus on the mystery element instead of the action. However, there are far worse thrillers around and this one is neither a masterpiece nor a fail.",The Commuter
87,antoniotierno,decent entartainment for a plot fitting the lead actor,7,15 January 2018,"The story puts Liam Neeson through his violent paces for a fourth time, swapping out Non-Stop's plane for a commuter train and tossing in some financial anxiety for motivation. It's funny in a way, but packed with a lot of adrenaline and action scenes. The mystery is less a whodunit than a whogotit, the ""it"" being a bag containing something stolen that the owner is desperate to recover. If you don't think too hard about why Neeson gets brought in or how the baddies operate or what the point is, you may be able to enjoy it. At least until the final act, when the film goes off the rails. Overall the plot's unlikelihood is really excessive but acting is good, as usual when Neeson is involved.",The Commuter
88,areatw,"Passable action flick, plenty of style but little substance",5,23 January 2018,"'The Commuter' is a stylish, well-produced action movie but, as with many other films in this genre, it has a plot that fails to stand up to scrutiny. Far-fetched would be an understatement - it all feels very 'make it up as you go along', with no explanation given for much of what takes place on the train and an underwhelming ending that leaves more questions than answers.Plot aside, 'The Commuter' is a decent piece of entertainment, thanks largely to the high production value and Liam Neeson's compelling performance as the lead character.If you can zone out of the story and enjoy the fights, explosions and everything else that comes with a Liam Neeson action movie, then 'The Commuter' is a passable action flick, but nothing that hasn't already been done before.",The Commuter

If someone wants to watch similar movie of Liam Neeson I recommend them to watch Taken, Taken 2, and Taken 3, also called 96 Hours in some countries.

Very realistic, mysterious, bit funny, and exciting. The most exciting part is mentioning of reward in this movie, something everybody likes without doubt. Not only that movie is realistic in the story, but also actor Liam Neeson is said to be from Ireland, just like in real life he is.

91,Richie-67-485852,THE VIEWER,6,22 December 2019,Its about the person watching the movie. Why? This movie causes you to get caught up in it as the story unravels through the main character who alone is worth the price of the movie i.e. Liam himself. Add to all this is the train and the old who is on it and why. You wouldn't think that they could make a movie using a train as a backdrop as going from one car to another is repetitive but if it could be done this is that movie. Again the star carries it. All the clues are given to help the viewer try to piece it all together but they are submitted so subtly that when called upon requires concentration or if you watching with another some discussion. The action in this movie builds and when you think it is going to climax continues to build so just hold on. This one keeps you guessing until the end and speaking of the end you get some nice closure too...worth a watch,The Commuter
92,educallejero,An entertaining disappointment,5,20 August 2018,"I don't watch Liam Neeson action flicks.I totally get why people may like (or love) him. I don't find that dumb or ridiculous. My fav action actor is Jason Statham though, and he's movies are enough to satisfy my action flick apetite.But then the trailer drops and Vera Farmiga is here making the pitch to Neeson. Vera Farmiga is just good at everything. So when I assumed she was going to be prominent as the villain in the movie I was hyped.The concept of this movie is great. Kind of a Detective Conan (the anime) episode, where you have to figure it our whom of these people is the bad guy and then what to do with the ""offer"".And that was awesome for about 25 minutes. After that, it turns into a mundane action flick. There are ""twists"" in the mystery of exactly what happened and who is whom.

He gets a handsome payout for doing this but it's not as easy as it sounds. Good writing keeps you guessing almost to the end as to what was going on. As good as The Sixth Sense. Really.

94,jon.h.ochiai,Liam Neeson is greater than,7,14 January 2018,"Liam Neeson elevates ""The Commuter"". Again, Neeson is way better than the material of the movie. Paradoxically, Director Jaume Collet-Serra's ""The Commuter"" poses as an action movie, but is really more thriller that contains action in the narrative genre. The screenplay by Byron Willinger, Philip de Balsi and Ryan Engle is very slow going from the exposition of the set up. Too bad. ""The Commuter"" opens with the provocative premise. Mysterious beautiful Vera Farmiga's Joanna asks commuter train passenger Michael, played by Neeson, ""What kind of person are you?"" Michael we learn from the introduction and series of flashbacks is an Insurance Agent for a large firm in New York City. He is laid off from his job after 10 years of service. This could not have happened at a more inopportune time. Michael and his wife Karen, caring Elizabeth McGovern, are strapped financially having to take out 2 mortgages on their home to send son Danny, played by Dean-Charles Chapman, to Syracuse University in the fall. Michael is a good man. He was an NYPD Officer before retiring to work insurance. Patrick Wilson plays Alex, Michael's dear friend and former Police partner. Too bad McGovern isn't leveraged more here. It is nice seeing her again in movies. After his layoff notice and riding the Commuter train home, Michael sits with Joanna, who offers him $100K if he agrees to determine what passenger on this train doesn't belong. This is more than hypothetical inquiry. What kind of person is Michael? Well, we kind of know through Neeson's persona that he is the noble Hero. Too bad also, charismatic Farmiga is relegated to her voice on mobile phone calls as Michael seeks to solve this puzzle, and save the lives of both Karen and Danny. Neeson is strong as the Michael desperately uses his will, wits, and action skills to save his family in the structured web of lies and betrayal. The ""idiot plot"" is that Joanna should know better than to f with Michael. After all he is Liam Neeson. To that point ""The Commuter"" almost drags and tests your patience waiting for Neeson to unleash upon the villains. Almost. Neeson does deliver with both physical fury and gravitas. Again, he is way better than ""The Commuter"" itself. Unfortunately, having created an intriguing premise into human nature the movie forgets that morphing into a chase and discover narrative-kind of ordinary. Collet-Serra and his writers could have been more ambitious. Liam Neeson deserved better. In a sense so do we. ""The Commuter"" is good mostly, because of Neeson. However, even our Hero can only do so much. This is not a great movie. Yet, it is entertaining. This may have been greater with a little more care and intention.",The Commuter
95,RforFilm,Liam Neeson on a train!...and that's pretty much it for The Commuter; a typical January action thriller,5,19 January 2018,"It's January. I guess that it's time for another Liam Neeson action movie. Like the Saw movies we get almost every October or every may when we get a new Marvel movie, January has become something of a tradition to receive a new movie (usually an action or thriller) that stars Liam Neeson. This seems to have started thanks to the first Taken film that was put out at that time. It's certainly not because Neeson is desperate for work. He's a great actor who has shown to have a wide range and is still casted in big movies. I think even he's self aware of these kinds of movies.Counting Taken, Non-Stop, and Unknown, they all have gruff heroes that have to stop something. And they're all put out in January. Even when they come out as bad movies, they tend to do well at the box office. This shows that Neeson is still a draw and they like him as an action hero. He has the right mix of an everyman, but can also be as intimidating as a Schwarzenegger or a Stallone. How much longer can we enjoy this? I don't know, and The Commuter seems to show no sign of him slowing down.Insurance salesman Michael MacCauley (played by Liam Neeson) commutes daily on a train to New York. His routine is just like a lot of New York workers who don't live in the city. Despite this, he remains a big part of his wife Karen and teenage son Danny's life. His day is different this time as he's being laid off to cut cooperate costs. Before heading home, he catches up with his former police partner Alex (played by Patrick Wilson). Afterword's, he catches the same train home, though he'll have to figure out how to pay for his son's college tuition.While sitting, a woman Joanna (played by Vera Farmiga) tells him that there's a bag of money in the bathroom and he'll receive $75,000 if he does a favor of finding someone before the last stop in Cold Springs. Joanna gets off while Michael inspects to see if there really is money. He finds a bag, which sets him in motion follow the favor. When he tries to tell someone, Joanna (via someone else's cell phone) has the person injured and tells Michael he has to find a person named ""Prynne"". Between a hard place, Michael searches for this person while finding a way out. If you've seen Taken, Unknown, or Non-Stop, then you've already seen The Commuter. What I mean by that is The Commuter is exactly the kind of movie that comes out in January; bland, but has enough to not make it a complete failure. The story itself, while certainly interesting, doesn't have much potential. It's like those dime store detective stories. These are the kinds of stories that are written in a heartbeat while trying to figure out how to take advantage of Liam Neeson. Neeson is the best thing about the movie. His charisma makes him charming enough to make you want to follow him. You'll never believe he's playing a character, but that's usually common with his movies. What is lacking from the other movies are his action skills, but the man is in his mid sixties, so it's to be expected. That may explain the climax of the film, which does include a train crash. The problem is that it's CGI is so obvious and fake that it looks more like a cartoon then a live action thriller. The movie works a little more in it's first half, but not by a lot.I'll give this five train maps out of ten. Those that like Liam Neeson will probably find something they'll like whether it's the actor himself or maybe even the story. It's nothing special and even the movie is aware that it's nothing special. It's another escapist thriller. I'd say if your really curious, it's worth the DVD rental later on, but I wouldn't waste money on it in theaters. Check your schedule and see if The Commuter is worth getting on now or later.",The Commuter
96,carbuff,"Slick, formulaic Hollywood action/thriller",8,8 December 2019,"I give ""The Commuter"" so many stars only because it fulfills its mission statement so well. This is not brilliant film-making by any standards. This isn't a classic of any kind by any measure. It's no more than just another throw-away Hollywood blockbuster, but then it has no pretenses of being anything else. ""The Commuter"" makes no promises other than being a well-produced, conventional, Liam Neeson star vehicle, and it checks those boxes perfectly. Therefore, it's like eating potato chips. You know what your're getting, and if that's not what you want, don't eat them. If this movie has any glaring problem, it's the same one afflicting so many other similar Hollywood action films nowadays--the lead actors are obviously way too old for the demanding action sequences. Liam Neeson looks like he would be severely winded after a short, hard round of tennis, to say nothing of nearly two hours of greater than Olympic-level athletics. Still, I can manage to suspend my disbelief, because I know very well that I'm eating potato chips, and these are some pretty decent ones. So, in conclusion, ""The Commuter"" has no nutritional value whatsoever, but it tastes pretty good, and that information is right there on the label, so nobody should be shocked or disappointed.",The Commuter
97,bankofmarquis,"Fun, but unspectacular",6,19 January 2018,"If it's January, then it must be time for another Liam Neeson action flick.Enjoying a career renaissance as a tough guy action star, Neeson, again, teams with Director Jaume Collet-Sara to bring an above average action/adventure film that puts Neeson ""on his own"" against a group of bad guys. This time around, he's an ex-cop (of course) on a commuter train heading home. When a mysterious woman (Vera Farmiga) stops him and offers him $100,000 to identify a person on the train, Neeson must dust off all of his ""particular"" skills to identify the mystery person.I won't spoil the rest of the plot for you (what there is of it) for there IS some fun and unexpectedness to it. What is also unexpected is the sparse amount of action there is in this action flick. We spend a long amount of time wandering up and down the aisle of the commuter train while Neeson tries to deduce who this mystery person is. This it too bad, for Director Collet-Sara has shown in other Neeson action flicks like UNKNOWN, RUN ALL NIGHT and my personal favorite NON-STOP, he can do action well. So when the action happens in this film, it is fun to watch, there just isn't enough of it, for my tastes.The acting in these sorts of films is a secondary function, but everyone involved fill their roles professionally - starting with Neeson. He has this sort of tough guy action film star thing down by now and he does not disappoint here. You know what to expect from Neeson in these films - and he delivers exactly that. Joining in are such fun ""oh that person"" actors like Farmigia as the mysterious woman, Patrick Wilson as Neeson's ex-partner, Jonathan Banks as a fellow Commuter and Sam Neil as a Police Captain who might (or might not) be involved.All things considered, this is a fun, if unspectacular, action flick. Enjoyable enough to pass the time. Certainly one that if you run across it while channel surfing on your couch you should check out. Or...if you are looking for a few hours of escape during these dark days of January, you are in capable, competent hands with Neeson and co.THE COMMUTER is a ""B"" movie - and I'll knock it down a partial grade for not being ""action-y"" enough.Letter Grade: B-6 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)",The Commuter

100,spookyrat1,Non-Stop Redux ... on a Train!,7,28 November 2019,"There's a lot wrong with The Commuter, that I shouldn't like.Many other reviewers on these pages have noted the weaknesses in the plot. Primarily, we have an all-powerful, all knowing criminal group who are able to supposedly rig hidden cameras throughout a commuter train (LOL!), as well as sabotage it and yet, not identify the one passenger on the train they wish to eliminate. To do this , they need to manipulate and extort regular commuter and former policeman Michael MacCauley played by Liam Neeson, in what amounts to a rejigging of the plot line to his previous film with director Jaume Collet-Serra, Non-Stop. That movie was primarily set in the air, whilst this one revolves around a conspiracy on railway tracks.It shouldn't work, but somehow I found this film to be quite compelling watching, while acknowledging its albeit plentiful weaknesses.Liam Neeson is just so believable in the role, even when selling a life insurance policy to a young married couple. He just has that aura of infallible integrity surrounding him which forces us to both believe in and support him. The film is unusual in that Neeson is virtually onscreen 100% of the time, whilst the other ostensible leads such as Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson and Sam Neill are only generally in a couple of fairly brief scenes. Thus, the majority of lower cast actors, playing MacCauley's fellow passengers on the fateful trip which occupies most of The Commuter's running time, share plenty of unexpected screen time allowing us to get to know and appreciate plenty of different characters. Like MacCauley, we are constantly finding out more of their personalities and motivations, as the story progresses and secrets and twists are revealed.The Commuter is fast paced with good production standards including a very unlikely, but visually arresting train crash, in which virtually none of the remaining train passengers appear injured, apart from the heroic conductor, who we laughingly never hear mentioned about again. I admit to wanting to see the story to its finality, though I admit disappointment that the police seemed happy to leave interest in the mysterious criminal network stall at the arrest, we are told of a few dirty cops.

Neeson plays Michael MacCauley, a former NYC cop turned insurance salesman. Michael is having a really bad day which only gets worse when he's chatted up on his commuter train by a woman calling herself Joanna (Vera Farmiga), who at first just seems annoying, but turns out to be pretty deadly. Joanna seems to have targeted Michael for a job requiring his particular set of skills. She wants him to use his experience as a former cop to suss out the identity of a unspecified person on the train with an unspecified bag whose unspecified contents are very important to some unspecified (but obviously very powerful) people. Joanna offers the cash-strapped Michael $100,000 ($25,000 up front) to find the person she's looking for - and threatens the lives of his wife and son if he doesn't comply before the train reaches... the end of the line. (And she also seems able to monitor all of his activities on the train and doesn't mind offing innocent people to make a point.) It's always fun to watch Neeson try to work his way out of such predicaments - and the combination of Neeson and Collet-Serra again delivers a thrilling, action-packed mystery - with an especially good cast and creative camera work.

102,Vivekmaru45,A very good action-thriller starring my favorite action Liam Neeson.,7,11 April 2018,"The majority of Liam Neeson movies that I have seen are excellent. And some are cult status like Darkman(1990) directed by Sam Raimi and the historical epic Rob Roy (1995). Liam Neeson gained a lot of fame later in his career for his role in Taken(2008).Back to this film. The film's premise is derivative of another film Nick of Time(1995) directed by acclaimed director John Badham. Plot in brief: Insurance salesman Michael is on his daily commute home, which quickly becomes anything but routine. After being contacted by a mysterious stranger, Michael is forced to uncover the identity of a hidden passenger on the train before the last stop. As he works against the clock to solve the puzzle, he realizes a deadly plan is unfolding, and he is unwittingly caught up in a criminal conspiracy that carries life and death stakes for everyone on the train.Verdict: the casting is superb. Direction, background sound-effects, camera-work are well handled. Liam Neeson carries the whole film from start to finish. Vera Farmiga has a very small appearance in the film, but her acting is thoroughly professional and the role given to her fits. Jaume Collet-Serra

103,bob-the-movie-man,"""This train is freaking me out"".",3,20 January 2018,"""The Commuter"" is not a good film. You know that I'm not a prude about action films: ""Die Hard"" is one of my all time favourites and I even gave this actor/director combo's previous outing - ""Non-Stop"" - a rather generous three Fads. But like many of my commutes, this is a hundred minutes of life that I won't get back again.Liam Neeson (""A Monster Calls"", ""Taken 3"") plays Michael MacCauley an insurance salesman (no, I'm not making it up) who of course used to be a police officer with a certain set of skills. With advancing years, a couple of mortgages to keep up and a son about to go to college, he is financially rather exposed.When a bad day turns worse, the commuting MacCauley is approached by a mysterious woman (Vera Farmiga, ""The Judge"", ""Up In The Air"") who offers him a financial bail-out for doing ""just one small thing"". No, it's not for sex in the toilet... it's to use his familiarity with the train and its normal passengers to find the person that 'doesn't fit there'. For there is a lot at stake and MacCauley is drawn into a perilous game where his own life and the lives of his son and wife Karen (Elizabeth McGovern, ""Downton Abbey"") are put at risk. What the inexperienced writers (Byron Willinger, Philip de Blasi and Ryan Engle (""Non-stop"")) were clearly shooting for was a Hitchcockian ""ordinary man in deep-water"" style flick of the James Stewart ""North by Northwest"" variety.... but they really miss this by a mile. With the 65 year old Liam Neeson - here playing 60 - performing acrobatics on, under and across an express train, belief is not just suspended - it is hung drawn and quartered! The action is just ludicrously unrealistic. The plot also has more holes than a moth-eaten jumper. Omnipotence of the villains is evident, but never explained, and while they are fiendishly clever in some aspects they are face-palmingly stupid about others. (No spoilers, but the threat to MacCauley's family is mind-numbingly foilable).A 'major event' at the end of reel two (if you've seen the spoilerish trailer you'll know what this is) leads - notably without any 'consequence' - into a completely ridiculous final reel that beggars belief. It also includes a ""twist"" so obvious that the writers must have assumed an IQ of sub-50.This is a film that melds ""Taken"", ""Non-stop"", ""Unstoppable"", ""Strangers on a Train"" and - most bizarrely and cringe-worthily - ""Spartacus"" to create a cinematic mess of supreme proportions. I put director Jaume Collet-Serra's last film - ""The Shallows"" - into my Top 10 films of 2016. He'll be lucky if this one doesn't make my ""Turkeys of the Year"" list for 2018.Avoid!",The Commuter

It was setting itself up to look like an intelligent mystery action. Having Neeson in this kind of movie spoils a lot, yet I thought this would be something different from his typical movies since he's getting older. I haven't seen the trailer though, just went to see the movie straight away.
After everything is set up, it just turns into a totally divorced from reality generic conspiracy action. The premise was indeed as silly as it gets. The ending was as unsurprising as possible. Omnipresent supervillains who can plan and predict everything by the smallest detail, control the situation without even being close yet fail at the most obvious things. The plot just plays itself, at times Neeson is not even doing anything to change the situation, it just changes by itself to adapt to his needs. This is not a well written movie. The ending had me saying ""oh, no, you're not doing this...oh God"".
Seeing Neeson perform ridiculous stunts was also a little confusing. No one should see an old man getting beaten like that. This just looks wrong.

110,Carycomic,"What you might call a ""Non-Stop"" train ride of thrills.",9,14 January 2018,"Yes, a pun was very much intended. Because this is the same type of plot as when he played a semi-alcoholic sky marshal on a transatlantic flight. Only this time, he's a recently unemployed ex-cop-turned-insurance salesman stuck on a commuter train (hence the title)! If you go to see this, don't expect it to be action-packed, right off the bat. It starts out with a slower pace than the entirety of ""Walk Among The Tombstones!"" And, to be honest, even after Michael (Neeson's character) starts getting those phone calls from Joanna (Vera Farmiga's character), I was thinking to myself...""I bet this turns out to be a paranoid fantasy. He's still zoned out, in his yuppie boss' office, listening to the rationalization for his being down-sized five years before he can qualify for his full pension. And when he snaps out of it, he'll go berserk (like those disgruntled postal workers back in the Nineties).""But, believe it or not...I WAS WRONG!The Bad Guys definitely proved to be outside his head. Although, despite some halfway decent plot twists involving the other passengers, the identity of their quarry didn't exactly turn out to be a _complete_ surprise. Nor was the _specific_ nature of her stolen mcguffin completely revealed. Was it evidence of money laundering? Illegal gambling? Drug and/or human trafficking?  Infuriatingly, that is never revealed. we only get shown and told that crooked cops are involved.  In short; Liam Neeson does an incredible job with the increasingly stereotypical stories he's given. Yet, I still have to wonder. Is he gradually growing as bored with those stereotypes as we are? Here's a hint.There were only eight other people in the theater--besides me-- for the 4:15 matinee.",The Commuter

Neeson is watchable and is the key to the film not being a complete waste of time. The film managed to gather a strong cast but this high concept Hitchcockian thriller fails to provide them with a well constructed film.

113,Darkside-Reviewer,"First it was Planes, now it's Trains, next Automobiles",5,11 April 2021,"The Commuter (2018) is yet another generic Action/Thriller directed by (Jaume Collet-Serra) staring Liam Neeson. Neeson and Serra have worked on several Action movies together including Unknown (2011) and Non-Stop (2014). Neesons character in The Commuter is almost identical to his character in Non-Stop only with a new name and instead of the movie taking place on a plane it takes place on a train.In The Commuter Neeson plays ex police officer turned life insurance salesman Michael MacCauley. Michael has taken the same train too and from his job in New York at the same times every day for the past ten years. Until one day he gets fired from his job and is left pennyless with a family to provide for. On this same day Michael catches his usual train home to give his family the bad news. On board the train Michael is approached by a strange woman who makes him a unique proposition, if he can find a particular passenger on board the train before the train reaches it's final stop he will be paid one hundred thousand dollars in cash. Michael tries turning down the offer but that just makes things worse as he finds out when his family are kidnapped and the only way to save them is for him to find the mysterious passenger aboard the train before time runs out.The plot to this film is almost identical to the one in Non-Stop with Neesons character being tasked with finding an unknown passenger in a confined space within a small time frame. The film is meant to be a Mystery/Thriller that keeps the viewer in suspense until the very end when the final twist is ultimately revealed. I personally lost interest in the films story about half way through the film after I figured out who the mysterious passenger was and put together what the twist ending was going to be.Neeson gives a decent performance and to the movies credit there are a couple of half way decent fight scenes that are enjoyable to watch. Sadly the plot is very predictable and extremely underwhelming. If you enjoyed Non-Stop and are a fan of Liam Neeson then you will probably like The Commuter. However if you're expecting something new and different then you may end up being very disappointed.",The Commuter
114,msbreviews,Rating: B-,6,12 April 2018,"If you enjoy my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Having in mind that The Commuter was released in January, it actually escapes the month's tendency to deliver horrible movies. If you like Non-Stop, then you'll enjoy it again ... on a train.Yes, this film is not ground-breaking. Yes, Liam Neeson plays Liam Neeson. Yes, the story is filled with cliches, unlikely plot points and implausible action sequences. That said, I am honestly surprised by how fun and entertaining The Commuter is.Obviously, Liam Neeson carries the entire thing and his character is the only one to actually get a decent backstory, so the movie does its job and checks the ""reasons to care about the protagonist"" box. The mystery is interesting even if it isn't that difficult to predict, but the overall story is well-played out in the way how Neeson's character gets the work done.Usually, in this type of films, the action is terrible. Shaky-cam and quick cuts all around the place. Not this one. Jaume Collet-Serra shows excellent camera work and delivers one of the best action scenes Neeson has performed in his whole career.
The fact that the story is set in only one location gives that claustrophobic vibe that any acceptable thriller always needs to have. The editing is surprisingly good and the fast pacing helps to compensate the less captivating moments during the second act.Tonally, it loses its grip towards the end. The silliness and implausibility take over the screenplay which totally brings down what was being a pretty entertaining movie.
If you are into this kind of brainless yet fun films, you will enjoy this one for what it is at its core. When it starts trying to be more than what it should be, there it's where I draw the line.",The Commuter

I really enjoyed that movie and I'm a huge Vera Farmiga fan. In fact, ""The Commuter"" has a phenomenal cast - it's just a shame their talents aren't put to better use.At times, it seemed very tongue-in-cheek and self-aware of its stupidity, as jokes and one-liners would randomly appear in scenes where you werne't expecting it. Things just became so unbelievable though that I started to tune-out. It all just seemed to be Liam Neeson pacing up and down a train while random phones rang.The insanity reached a peak once a major train derailment took place and all the passengers casually started doing a spot of interior decorating like nothing happened.If you have seen ""The Taking of Pelham 123"", ""Unstoppable"" or ""Under Siege 2"", then you have seen better versions of this.",The Commuter

119,Alexander_Blanchett,Entertainern yes - but the concept is really overused now,5,1 August 2018,"Actually very entertaining but also quite common Liam Neeson auctioner that was really full of holes like Swiss cheese. Too bad, because it had some tense and fine style as well as interesting cinematography but the problem was that the format is really dried out now... we saw the same kind of thing in ""Non-Stop"" by the same actor/director duo and this time the story just takes place on a train and is even more unbelievable just like many of the stunts. Too bad that a good cast was wasted. Next to Liam Neeson, who really was not in top form here, we have Vera Farmiga in a wasted role that mostly focuses on a voice performance only. Sam Neill who was also quite non existing except for the beginning and ending. But I always love to see him. Patrick Wilson did his usual boring thing. Good to see Jonathan Banks and Elizabeth McGovern who almost had no lines. The score was good some effects decent and it never got boring but even if you try to switch off the logic you just can't, its so illogical its funny how it got a green light.

120,MrDHWong,Don't expect too much and enjoy the film for the satisfying time passer it was made to be,6,12 July 2018,"The Commuter is an action thriller starring Liam Neeson. Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (Non-Stop, The Shallows), it is an absurd but mostly enjoyable action film of the usual Liam Neeson standards.On his usual train commute home, former cop-turned-insurance salesman Michael MacCauley (Liam Neeson) meets and interacts with an unusual woman named Joanna (Vera Farmiga). Joanna tells Michael of a hypothetical situation, which involves him finding one particular passenger on board the train and upon doing so, will result in him pocketing $100,000. Intrigued by this, Michael further investigates the train carriages for clues, only to discover that this situation is not hypothetical and has resulted in placing him and his family in great danger.As farfetched as it is entertaining, The Commuter is a fun popcorn film with enough suspense and action to hold one's attention for the duration of its runtime. Liam Neeson is his usual action-star self, essentially playing the same character we have seen many times before, so one would know what to expect. The film is in the same vein as other Liam Neeson-helmed action thrillers, like Taken and Non-Stop, the latter of which was by the same director, and this does nothing to detract from the formula, but if it ain't broke.

It starts off great, but crashes and burns towards the end. And it's heartbreaking, since the set-up is so strong.
Without going into plot, Liam Neeson is the best thing in this train wreck (see what I did?) He is a regular joe who is thrusted in a bizarre task of identifying a person on a train for this mysterious group. Very Hitchcockian, which downshifts into typical...and unbelievable commuter train crash. Neeson literally gets thrown from one train car to the next (was ridiculous in the first ""Mission Impossible"" movie). Even as a silly action film to switch your brain off, the big mistake it makes it to make it make sense. By that, I mean, filling in details of how the game was set-up. Luckily it was not a long flick and may be casual entertainment on a slow weekend. Be warned...this is a movie you walk out of where you shake your head confused as to the talent involved that would make something so flawed.",The Commuter

There is an interesting moral dilemma that most of us face; what would you do or not do for money...a lot of money?
 There IS such a thing as being noble.
Sacrifice for others, friendship
 Things I liked:
Jaume Collet-Serra always does a great job with details. This is his 4th movie with Liam Neeson. 
There's something about Vera Farmiga that makes it hard to take your eyes off of her.
One of the greatest Liam Neeson fight scenes ever. I love the tight quarters and how that ups the drama. For an aging guy, he can still make an exciting action scene. Things I didn't like:
A lot of things happen that are ridiculous, so just don't think too hard about it and you'll still enjoy the ride.
Some of the dialogue is predictable and silly. Interesting lines:
""You want proof you're a good man? Look at your family."" - Liam's best friend
""My job is to answer one basic question."" - Joanna
""What's that?"" - Liam
""What kind of person are you?"" = Joanna

132,coreyjdenford,Derails off the tracks,6,19 January 2018,"This review of The Commuter is spoiler free*** (3/5)LIAM NEESON COMES with baggage, that's inevitable after years of being caught in action thrillers that have both earned him a spotty track record but it's also given him a particular set of skills, these he can use to pull punches, kick a few people and even pull out a gun or two. Granted this may lead you to quote that infamous line from the first Taken - go ahead then, but it also means that he's never really boring even though some of his movies certainly are. 
 
Though his track record isn't all bad or all boring as he has, on occasion between franchises stepped over a few high peaks (The Grey, A Walk Among the Tombstones are worth the mention), but also in that time he's also stepped into a puddle of deep, deep mud (Battleship, Taken 2 and 3) and often it seemed that he would never really get away from that plot. So, yes this particular set of skills can get him out of some heavy sh*t, but sometimes that can be hard to get out of if indeed it's anything like Battleship. Still, he manages to stay entertaining and it's his many collaborations with director Jaume Collet-Serra that make him an entertaining asset to action. Firstly, Unknown (nobody knew him), next Non-Stop (he killed on a plane), and lastly in Run All Night (he saves his family from danger). However their fourth time as a duo The Commuter is indeed their best yet. Plot-wise it's like it is the sequel to Non-Stop, however his acting chops carry the film and he proves that he can play his way around some Hitchcockian twists. 
 
Here he has to chase a stranger on a train, in an effort to get information and the hitch is that he has to do it while on the train. Granted the plotting doesn't make much sense and the logic bomb detonates before the train leaves the station, but it's the dedication of Collet-Serra to work in small spaces and Neeson's will to raise the tension while finding this person. Also the murder mystery plotting sounds like an Agatha Christie adaptation, and sure in small doses it can be, though the train isn't as lavish as The Orient Express also the supporting players are nothing like that. Still what there is on offer for the supporters is another team-up with Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson except here they don't share any screen time together. In short, The Commuter isn't exactly a thoughtful thriller thanks to the workmanlike scripting but it is surprisingly entertaining and that is worth the watch.VERDICT Neeson is thrilling to watch in this surprisingly enjoyable if a little forgettable crowd-pleaser that takes you on a thrill ride - in more than just one way.",The Commuter

Check out my review below to find out!",6,20 October 2019,"""The Commuter"" (2018), starring Liam Neeson. I honestly wasn't expecting much out of this movie. Liam Neeson has been subjected to some real garbage ""movies"" lately. But, much to my surprise, I was actually impressed with this film! I was expecting it to be just another hostage movie like ""The Taking of Pelham One Two Three"" (1974), or ""Under Siege 2: Dark Territory"" (1995). But, it was something entirely different, in good ways. This movie has a great story, great acting, and great special effects. The only little nitpick about the storyline is that it starts off a little slow. But, the opening does not last long and does not ruin the film at all. Once Liam gets onto the train, the movie gets really good! This movie kept me thinking all the way through, it had many unexpected twists and turns, and overall an exciting storyline. The acting was really well-done, but Liam Neeson is of course the shining star in this film. Being a modern movie, the special effects are of course first-rate. That's usually a given in modern movies! Now for the flaws, which truthfully don't hurt this movie at all. The sets/locations are hit and miss in this movie. Some are good, some are okay, but a few of them are dull. But at the end of the day, the sets/locations do their job even though they're not perfect. The only other problem is the soundtrack. It does have some good moments, but overall it's just another typical generic cliched action/mystery film soundtrack. ""The Commuter"" is definitely a great movie, not Liam Neeson's best, but it's still worth watching. I give this film a 3 out of 5 star rating, which equates to 6 out of 10 stars.

134,gavinp9,Better than I expected!,7,15 January 2018,"'The Commuter' is the 4th film directed by Collet-Serra starring Liam Neeson - and it's better than 'Non-Stop' (the one on a plane), but not quite as good as 'Unknown' (the amnesia one). Neeson is struggling to pull off looking even 60 (dyed hair doesn't hide it), but luckily there isn't as many stunts as 'Taken' here. Michael (Neeson) is an ex-cop who now sells life insurance - why'd he leave the force? Don't know. He does, however, commute into New York City via train every day.The first 30min is quite slow & scene setting (Wilson as his ex-partner, Neill as police captain, Banks as fellow train-buddy), before Joanna (Farmiga) sets a mystery in motion that slowly reveals itself. The film slowly picks up pace as more clues are revealed and the body count slowly, but almost plausibly rises (six in total, I think). There's a stand-off at the end, but it's still all over in 100min.I think because my expectations were so low, I enjoyed this more than I might otherwise have. The tension is built quite well, the score's good, the fight scenes are (mostly) realistic and the story, while far-fetched, is not totally unbelievable - some of the stunts are, but that's to be expected. Certainly nothing new or revolutionary, but an enjoyable action/thriller that doesn't outstay it's welcome.",The Commuter

136,gustheaffen,"Wow, time to hang it up Liam",2,16 January 2019,"This was one of the dumbest and laziest scripts ever produced to be headlined by big actors. The story itself was disjointed and silly. Aging financially strapped 60 year old Liam lives paycheck to paycheck, house mortgaged to the hilt with his son's college tuition due and he gets fired. He pleads to keep his job stating that he was going to retire in 5 years. Not sure what planet that was going to happen in his financial situation. After making a poor choice Liam has to figure out who on the train doesn't belong and we spend an agonizing hour going through literally EVERY passenger until ding, ding, ding he finally gets to the last option and realizes DUH it was her all along. Then a lot more silly and ridiculous things happen including a lot of amateurish CGI and the movie 'conspiracy' wraps up in an even more simplistic and lazy way. The funniest part of this movie was the constant injection of how bad wall street is, how he lost all his money in 2008 (I guess he didn't leave it in the market and recover over the last 10 years like everyone else) and at one point he even curses Goldman Sachs.. Spare us your stupid rhetoric (btw Goldman Sachs is a HUGE democrat donor).

137,ginocox-206-336968,An exciting ride,9,28 March 2018,"""The Commuter"" features a clandestine criminal organization that rivals SPECTRE in its reach and the fear it inspires, yet employs adolescents and is concerned that an FBI investigation will bring it to its knees. If one can get onboard with a few massive incongruities in the plot, it's an exciting action film with satisfyingly Byzantine plot twists and numerous red herrings. Performances are uniformly good. Liam Neeson plays a character not unlike his character in Taken and Non-Stop, but it's an interesting, multifaceted character and he does it well. The film deserves recognition for concentrating on the story and not becoming distracted with irrelevant political messages or efforts to promote diversity. Will Smith was great as Agent J and had tremendous energy with Tommy Lee Jones. Helen Mirren was outstanding in Eye in the Sky, in a role originally written for a male. But many recent films that made visibly deliberate efforts at diversity have been disappointments critically, financially, or both, including ""Ghostbusters,"" ""The Magnificent Seven,"" ""The Secret in Their Eyes"" and ""Justice League."" TC features a female villainess, but the character is organic and could not have easily been cast as a male. Superficial diversity which necessitates explanatory exposition that takes time and detracts from the plot is quickly replacing excessive reliance on jiggly-cam shots as my most frequent criticism. Even clever devices, as in ""Small Town Crime,"" require explanation, as why a Caucasian calls a black woman his sister. Jiggly-cam shots are a major distraction in TC. Some of the cinematography, particularly in the early scenes and in the climatic special effects is novel and brilliantly executed. But other shots seem as a ninety-seven-pound weakling is trying to handhold an eighty-pound camera, while standing on a gyroscopic balance board. The shots disrupt the viewer's willful suspension of disbelief and just look cheap and amateurish.",The Commuter

139,Mcduff3601,Entertaining but very mediocre not one of Liam's better action flicks,6,30 July 2018,"While I got what I wanted out of this movie, some time to zone out and be entertained there were a lot of things wrong with this movie that I found I kept having to tell myself to let go which pulls you out of the story at least temporarily.I thought the opening sequence was pretty cool, they show Michael (Liam) going to work each day over the course of seems like a year or more with quick cuts but the Liam stays in frame so he kind of stays constant while his surroundings change to show the passage of time. This was too predictable for me, they tried to get you off the scent by introducing some of the characters but I had a pretty good idea who was the baddy right away. Unless I missed it we never find out who is the top baddies or really why they are doing what they do, in some cases this wouldn't matter so much but it left this movie feeling rushed and shallow. The fight scenes were a little repetitive and Liam's character takes every form of beating and just shrugs it off, he gets pepper sprayed (kind of accidental like) and in seconds is able to use a napkin or something and is okely dokely. Even John Maclain walked with a bit of a limp at the end of Die Hard - 60 year old Michael just brushes it off. The acting was pretty good all around, it did leave you wondering at times just how was a baddy and how many were there. But all in all it was like lighting a match the action lasts for a short time then its gone and discarded. If you are a completionist and HAVE to watch this movie to say you saw every Neeson flick out there then it won't be too painful to sit through and watch, if you paid money and expected a Taken kind of movie you will probably be dissapointed. You want a flick that has the good guys fighting the bad guys watch The Equalizer its more fun than this movie.",The Commuter

So read the review and forget about the movie!,4,4 February 2018,"Oh boy, the first movie released in 2018 that I saw is a stinker. Hope it's not gonna predict the quality of the cinema year ahead or something.This is another addition to the mighty Neesploitation genre - Liam Neeson starring in trashy action - that got off to a promising start with 2008's ""Taken"", and has gotten steadily worse ever since.I think ""Taken"" is still the only one worthy of watching, so I won't mention the others and urge you to forget ""The Commuter"" too. After reading my review, of course. I had too much fun writing it to let it go to waste now.Running around various locations and conquering the skies in the plane have been done already, so the new location for Neeson's accidental but skillful character to kick ass is the commuter train.So... The dangerous cat-and-mouse game begins, the family is in danger (of course), Neeson has enough hero moments and ""manly man growling in manly way moments"", plus some solid supporters appearing briefly to add some dramatic heft (Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, Jonathan Banks, Sam Neill). So far, so generic but good, hmm?What the movie doesn't have is something resembling a solid script - the beginning is OK but once the real story starts, many events or turns seem embarrassingly stupid or illogical or insufficiently explained.The result is akin to some teenager reading ""Murder on the Orient Express"", forgetting most of the story, and rebuilding it almost from scratch in modern settting.Also, there's a shortage of exciting hand-to-hand fights or action setpieces, although what they do have is gripping (pickaxe vs guitar, Neeson getting off the commuter section for the first time, how the train stops finally).Also, the beginning is too long, there's almost nothing interesting happening during the first half. I guess the makers counted on building suspense, but the story is not nearly good enough for that.By reaching the halfway point, I was feeling pretty bored already. If they didn't have budget for more action or effects or something, they should have fleshed out the mysterious nemesis character at least. Shooting dialogue and ominous looks surely ain't that expensive?I still love Neeson, and the idea of him starring in trashy action, so I wish to end with positive note. Isn't it great that a man can turn into a bona fide action star just months his 56th (!) birthday - that's when ""Taken"" was released - and still be able to do it ten years later? He truly has set an good example to us all!The director is some Spaniard called Jaume Collet-Serra who has helmed three Neesploitations previously, ""Unknown"", ""Non-Stop"" and ""Run All Night"". All are crappy also.By the way, you should do a Google image search for ""the commuter posters"", the artwork is great, much better than the movie itself!",The Commuter
142,dommercaldi,Fun Enough Basic Liam Neeson Action Movie,5,15 April 2020,"Pros:
1. The opening sequence does a great job at showing Michael MacCauley's (Liam Neeson) motives, in regards to his financial troubles and his closeness to his family.
2. Liam Neeson gives a good performance.
3. The train setting helps to add a claustrophobic feel to the film which only serves to heighten the tension.
4. The action is entertaining to watch and is shot quite well.
5. The film is really quite enjoyable, especially when it enters into the thriller genre in the second act.Cons:
1. There are some strange camera shots and editing decisions.
2. Some of the dialogue is a little clunky, specifically in regards to the social commentary on class and socio-economic status.
3. There are a few plot-holes. For example, Michael MacCauley somehow evades the police by switching cover right in front of them, and if Alex Murphy (Patrick Wilson) was an antagonist all along, then how were the police able to rescue Michael MacCauley's family, as Alex Murphy was the only policeman informed about Michael MacCauley's family?
4. Stock action music is ubiquitous in this movie.
5. The CGI doesn't look great and it definitely won't age well.
6. There is a show of solidarity between the commuters at the end as they try to protect Sofia (Ella-Rae Smith). This is bizarre as they had never shown any inclination of unity before then.",The Commuter
143,leesimon-26357,Loved this a lot. More suspense than action for most of it,9,21 February 2021,"I like a lot about this movie. I found the characters well-written and believable and their development compelling. I bought into the conspiracy completely and early on. From that point forward, I found the film suspenseful and thrilling. There were a few fight scenes which were very fun, but overall, not a ton of physical action. The cast was excellent and it was acted very well. There are many twists throughout, and I enjoyed the ride (no pun intended.)
I'd see it again. Highly recommended.",The Commuter
144,gabriel_sanchez,Yet another nice Neeson's flick,9,22 April 2018,"I think liamhorsfall's review pretty much says it all. Indeed, this is yet another entry for Neeson where he plays a grizzled, independant tough-guy, but this time, disguised as a commuter.Don't get me wrong, that's not the plot at all. Michael MacCauley, played by Neeson, is a hard-working life insurance salesman that's drawn into a criminal conspiracy.It's all you could have asked for in a Neeson's movie; and he plays it masterfully.Some pet-peeves of mine includes a few over the top stunts that are far too surreal and maybe the fact that not much is said about this conspiracy thing.If you're a person that pays attention to minimal details, you might think the course of the plot is pretty obvious, but then again, that's not how you're supposed to watch a Neeson's movie.",The Commuter
145,Hallelujah289,"Repetitive, but offers some action thrills",6,7 February 2020,"Liam Neeson, now a blue collar worker, once employed a set of special skills, which lay dormant and which are now awakened by the threat against his family, whom he must protect.If The Commuter sounds like Neeson's runaway hit Taken, you got that right.In The Commuter, Neeson is an ex-cop turned life insurance salesman. Because of his long hours in the office, his physique is somewhat slimmer down, and he appears a little older and more tired looking in a rumpled suit and worn shoes, and has to commute by train every day.Neeson, down and out, with the wary disposition and the worn clothes to match it, might've made for an interesting variation of his action hero role, but he is much too tall and rugged looking to really be that believable as anything less than a capable man. At his life insurance work he is even suave, has many kinds of friendships, has a very decent relationship with his loving wife. The film may describe Neeson as being in a tough spot, but quickly contradicts itself with the way characters interact with Neeson, who maintains a level of authority and dignity throughout.In this way Neeson doesn't have much to transform himself into, sliding into an action hero finesse like he never left the police force at all. Neeson is so good at the action part though he remains fun to watch. The ride wasn't boring for me, just not as convincing as Taken, or earning the same dramatic emotional pay off as his character in that film beats the odds.Still, The Commuter is enjoyable and at times very compelling, i.e. when Neeson almost gets decapitated by a train car which had derailed, swung around and skyrocketed in the air. If this kind of thriller moment entices you, The Commuter offers others like it. I would probably rate this 6.5/10 if allowed. I think the current IMDb rating is fair.",The Commuter

You know, the one where you've got a ball that rolls around and sticks to everything around it as it gets bigger and bigger? Now imagine that instead of a ball, you're rolling Liam Neeson around and all the characters he's ever played are sticking to him....the former CIA guy from Taken, the Air Marshal from Non-Stop, the guy that fist fights wolves in The Grey. You get my point. Liam Neeson is your default tough guy when you need to make an action movie abut a tough guy in a tough situation, forced to deal with it against his will. He's good at what he does and for that reason, even though some of his movies might be poorly written, you can't deny that they're action-packed and keep you on the edge of your seat. The Commuter is yet another in his extensive portfolio of awesome action films. While it seems unfair to consistently typecast this amazing and very talented actor, he seems to be enjoying his roles and it shows in his work. So I'm not disappointed and neither should you be.Commuter is basically Non-Stop. Let's get that out of the way. Except instead of taking place on an airplane, it takes place on a Commuter train in downtown New York. I admit that what sets the plot in motion is indeed ridiculous, and you will very likely roll your eyes in disbelief but here me out: stick with it.

The fight scenes are more like a girl fights, there is no manly in any of the fight scenes.

All Michael has to do is to locate that person and put a tracking bug in the bag and he will collect $100 thousand dollars. Now you know there is much more to all this and this is very exciting and a heart stomping good story. Of course, Michael accepts the challenge and wants the $100K. We see some people die and via a telephone call with Joanna who blames Michael for the deaths and is told his family may die if he doesn't do the job he agreed to. Oh, oh! 
 
Many questions go through Michael's head and ours too. Who is that person, what is in the bag, what is this all about?In time, we see Liam Neeson do what he does best although he never uses those words. (We did that for him. Ha!)

Alex Murphey, who was Michael's partner when Michael was on the Police force; Sam Neil as Capt Hawthorne, who was recently promoted and knew Michael as a detective; Elizabeth McGovern as Karen, Michael's wife.Near the end we will see some very unusual stunts and CGI, of course, and some of it is so terrifying I could hardly watch.

158,AnishMisra,The Commuter Review,7,31 March 2018,"The Commuter is a film directed by Jaume-Collet Serra. The trailers for the film looked OK and I just wanted to see the film because of Liam Neeson. And after seeing the film I would say that I wasn't disappointed.Plot: Follows, Michael MacCauley, who is unwittingly recruited into a murder conspiracy after meeting Joanna while on his daily train commute.Story and direction: This is the fourth time this actor and director combo have worked together. And I can definitely say that the experiences of their films has never been dissatisfying. Although I would like to point out that this is the weakest of their combinations. But, let's start out with the good. The characters of the story are very interesting and heart-touching. You feel for them each time they make a decision. Also the story is very fast paced. So actually no time is wasted and that always pumps the adrenaline in your body. The action sequences are so greatly filmed. Never for a moment they felt fake. And very great editing and camera work. Kudos to Collet-Serra and team for bringing good action movies to the screen. Now coming to the negatives. Firstly, it was basically like Non-Stop except this time it is a train. That means, I felt nothing new was being contributed to the film as such. Also, details of some characters were not much. No such motivation was known, which made me confuse a bit. And finally, the film felt implausable many times. I felt like is that even really possible.Performances: Liam Neeson does what he is good at and he excels at it. You do feel for his character every single second and that's why he is my favorite. Vera Farmiga does good too although I did feel her character could have been given more. Same goers for Patrick Wilson too. It was good to see Sam Neill on the screen after a long time. The passengers too gave a good performance.Verdict: This film is a decent action film. If you are a Liam Neeson fan, go watch it and you will not be disappointed. But if you are expecting a real good experience, then this film is far away from that and you can surely avoid it.I am going with a 7/10.",The Commuter
159,highmarksreviews,Non-Stop on a Train,5,23 April 2018,"Liam Neeson action-thriller's usually go by a certain formula, and ""The Commuter"" is no exception when it comes down to it. While admittedly, many of its twists and ideas it picks up are intriguing, but those are very quickly forgotten and swapped for classic clichés. Another thing that this movie bungled was its ending. A CGI fuelled mess of a climax and an obvious villain reveal also dragged the overall experience. Liam Neeson gave a typically committed performance and the rest of the cast wasn't too shabby either. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, though never shown to have interacted throughout, are familiar faces from ""The Conjuring"" and it was a nice to see them doing something new together. If there is one thing that came off as spot-on, it would be the camerawork. Cleverly shot angles, transitions, colours and lens flares all help encapsulate the intensity of the plot. ""The Commuter"" seems to borrow too much from previous Liam Neeson roles and alternates rapidly between smart and dumb twists, but in the end, manages to settle somewhere in the middle for a mediocre thriller experience with creative and effective camerawork.",The Commuter

161,autisticreviewers,Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,6,22 January 2018,"Michael MacCauley (played by Liam Neeson) is a businessman and has been at the top of his game for over 10 years, and has everything he ever wants, a steady job, great friends, a very healthy family, but one day he is approached by a very mysterious stranger by the name of Joanna (played by Vera Fermiga) and she puts Michael in a ""you have no choice"" situation. He is forced to find a person on the train and kill him/her for 100,000 dollars.
In the hands of director Jaume Collet-Serra (who also directed Nonstop, Orphan and The Shallows) he does a pretty good job at setting everything up. The problem here is that the movie is very predictable and you can see whats going to happen 10-20 mins before it happens. The whole movie was 99% exactly the same as Non-Stop, except it was on a train. The story was the same old cliche we've seen 1000 times before, the acting was decent all round, the effects were decent, but nothing great. The pace itself was pretty good, it never gets boring and there are a few good, tense fight scenes that make the movie worth while.All in all, it's a very hard to film to review, it's a very hard film to hate, and it's a very hard film to love. Liam Neeson does what he does best which is speaking with his naturally talented Irish accent and his fighting skills make the movie all worth while to watch. It's far from a classic and it just should've been called Non-Stop 2, but it's definitely worth a watch, but maybe as a rental.

But not only is Neeson at the top of his game, but the story and pacing of the movie are stellar, and it really hooks you and keeps you wondering what new twists and turns will come next. The setting of the train is used to full effect, and really showcases how good drama and thrills are so evocative aboard a train, as other movies have also exemplified in the past.Just amazing special effects and action, if you've ever thought that movies with great action scenes involving trains often seem to reach a higher level of electricity and excitement, then this movie will be right up your alley!The conspiratorial plot is surprisingly well told - no spoilers - but the way they set up the mysterious villainous organization is excellent, without really giving anything away to the viewer.

It's cool that Liam Neeson launched an action-hero career later in life, and while I loved him in Taken, it seems like he's mostly picked nonsensical action scripts since then. For example, Non-Stop was far-fetched but if you did a little extra suspension of disbelief (which I did), it turned out to be a pretty good thriller. But this?? This?! This is one of the silliest, most implausible scripts ever written. The entire premise makes zero sense. ALL-SEEING, ALL-KNOWING ""Bad Guys"" (Well, Vera Farmiga) can make literally anything happen at any time, kill anyone inside or outside the commuter train, and see what's going on inside the commuter train at all times - and yet they can't locate and kill the single witness who's on the train. Thus, they need to pull Liam Neeson's strings to make it happen. The implausible moments pile one on top of the other throughout the film.

It sets itself up with an interesting social question, of what people will do to protect themselves and to what lengths they will help others. This moral dilemma Michael is put in could have gone in a really cool direction, and could have made the film rather compelling. However, subsequent cliches and plot holes overtake the movie instead, and the potential for a fascinating social commentary is wasted.

There are many improbabilities that arise, such as how certain characters know the information they do, or how all of these coincidences perfectly align.

Its fun when some tight little thriller story evolves in an enclosed space (Flight Plan, Panic Room, Speed, Source Code etc) so I thought ""yeah, why not"". Source Code in particular, being a really fun and rewatchable movie, was remembered fondly because here again Vera Farmiga pops up telling someone on a train to find someone else on the train who looks ""out of place"". Except this time, the plot is way, way beyond the credibility of Source Code's plot. The plot is so unbelievably convoluted, insane and rammed with plot holes, that I was in a state of amazement that it ever got greenlit, yet alone actually produced and released. How did it happen? Is it a joke? Did the screenwriter have one hour to write it as part of a competition? I have no idea. Its simply the worst film I can think of right now.

169,tmpsvita,Flat and boring,5,28 January 2018,"The fourth collaboration between Liam Neeson and the Spanish director Jaume Collet-Serra gave rise to a double, perhaps it is better to say to a bad copy, of their proceeding work ""Non-stop"".
After seeing the trailer I had already noticed the similarities between the two films but this did not deter me in going to see him at the cinema, even the winning team did not change, so my expectations were quite high, I expected a thriller an engaging and entertaining action just as it had been Non-Stop, a little less so was ""Run All Night"".
The problem, however, that makes this ""The Commuter"" a real failure is the total lack of the engaging and fun action I was talking about before, the film, in fact, throughout its duration tries to dupe the viewer with some special effect here and there, only in some scenes they results functional, a very noisy soundtrack and a dynamic direction that, however, shows the quality as a director of Serra especially when he has to move in tight spaces like an airplane (Non-Stop) or, in this case , a train.
The problem is not the absurd and therefore absolutely untrustworthy subject, but the plot that, in taking itself too seriously, makes water on all sides; the problem are the really badly written dialogues that make any situation on the edge from being ridiculous or embarrassing.
And it isn't neither is the interpretation, all in all acceptable, of Liam Neeson who, despite his age, still manages to perfectly support the most ""animated"" sequences.
Each of these sequences, however, has never managed to make met have fun and at no time during the film I felt involved but rather the various problems I listed above produce the opposite effect: a boring, flat, glossy and untreated movie.

171,jeannefrancoise,To find and protect the witness in the commuter,8,25 January 2018,"Dear readers, The Commuter movie has Liam Neeson as main character, so that by his reputation in acting, we can expect about fighting, conspiracy, twist plot, heroism, etc in this movie. Liam Neeson in this movie is still like acting like in Taken movie, with the mobile phone, hard voice, and story plot that is destined to protect somebody and to help his family. The Commuter is the movie about an ordinary insurance salesman, which was also an ex-cop, that has been asked to find a witness of murder that bring a bag inside the daily commuter and will be given some bunch of dollars, by a strange woman. If Neeson refused the job, his family will be in danger. Then Neeson does not have any choice, then he is walking from one wagon to other wagon, to find that witness. During his investigation, the characters in this story are developing until audience can not guess which one is the witness. Here, the commuter is representing middle-class American society that lived in urban areas, to work in the central, so that they are using commuter everyday. In the commuter, we can see ordinary men and women, looking for job, or stay in their ordinary job and because they meet each other, they are becoming closer and closer, but when Neeson ask for suspicious person, they never know. The storyline here wants to critic that even the commuter people meet everyday, they never know how is each person life outside the train after they are taking off the train. The Director also want to show us that in the train in the really daily and normal life, there is conductor, technician, daily passengers, and not-regular passengers. The camera moving is really in details as we can see train from first wagon until the last wagon, without missing the main story in just one wagon. I rate this movie 8 stars, because there are at least 2 (two) illogical plots for me, first is when Neeson is fighting, really hardly, the mobile phone is still safe from his pocket. Second is about the appearance of strange woman to direct Neeson to do strange job like that (to find a witness of murder that bring a bag in the commuter) and why she did not choose other person. Even audience will know why Neeson is chosen, but the method of that woman to find Neeson, we never know. The coincidence is not explained and what is inside the bag of the witness, seems unclear for me. Even in some critical scenes that explain everything, for me the finding of witness in the case like that, is just over-reaction. Well, maybe this is why there is movie, to live up our imagination and to see many things in different ways. After watching this movie, you can see commuter train in different way, you can see insurance sales in different way, police in different way, and witness of murder in different way. It is sure that you can not guess who is the bad and who is good until the ending. The old Neeson is still well-fighting. What a good actor.",The Commuter

By this time, we all know what kind of movies Mr. Liam Neeson makes. I give him credit though, he has embraced his role and continues to find movies and he makes the most out of b- scripts.  I have a few things to list that I had problems with, so SPOILERS AHEAD:-It is never shown or explained how Joanna (played by Vera Farmigo) has eyes on everything that MacCauley (Neeson) does. It is mentioned several times throughout the movie, ""you dont know what they are capable of"". I guess not, because I didnt see how they could be watching MacCauley. Were they tapping other cell phones? Just show me something. 
I know commuters probably see and hear things daily that doesnt phase them. I have a hard time believing that these rough and tough passengers would not notice knock out, drag out brawls leading to several deaths. Or numerous rounds being fired. One guy actually got thrown out the window! In the background though these other ""commuters"" are just riding in ignorant bliss. But oh well. 
Despite my two big complaints, I actually enjoyed this movie. I loved the cast. I loved how the director only needed the opening five minutes to give his main character some depth and the viewer some understanding of him and where he stands in life.  As for the ending, I won't spoil the big reveal here, but it was pretty obvious about an hour in. I usually brag when I can crack a mystery before someone else, but this movie made it too obvious.

Ridiculously, the character must have possessed Marvel comics style mutant/superhuman powers, having the combined physical fitness of what would have to have been (given what he went through) equivalent to that of dozens of gold-medal Olympic athletes.Furthermore, he showed not too many bumps and bruises for it all at the end of all his troubles. His clothing was also all pretty much intact with barely a torn seam to be seen!The train-crash effects were well done although typically predictive and thus oh-so-boring now.To cap it all off, the final straw was to force upon us the cringe of an hilariously silly ""I'm Spartacus"" moment towards the end.Don't get me wrong, I like Neeson, I like Farmiga (yummmm), I like Jonathan Banks and I - sort of - like Sam Neill, and Patrick Wilson is 'okay'... but this movie became nothing but an utter disappointment after such an interesting beginning idea.I think the highlight of the movie was a very cleverly designed roll of end-of-film credits, laid out in London schematic Tube Map style format (as designed by Harry Beck in 1931).

Viewers will instantly recognise similarities with the Source Code, where Vera Farmiga once again reprises her role as the mysterious woman who directs the main character, Michael MacCauley, played by Liam Neeson, on a train in what he must do... and to hurry while doing it.Liam Neeson, inturn, reprises an uncannily similar role as when he played Bill Marks, from 2013's Non-Stop, a retired law enforcement official who must stop what might happen on the train.The similarities don't stop there... 2010's Unstoppable's plot makes an appearance, and the viewer could be forgiven for expecting to see Denzel Washington driving the train while desperately trying to stop it. Keanu Reeves from 1994's Speed also wouldn't be out of place dashing through the carriages... but thankfully neither of these things happen.One person summed the movie up well whilst encompassing the recent string of other daft action movies, ""have movie makers gone back to the 1990's to make movies?""The absurdity of the movie gets worse toward the end with a train scene reminiscent of 1995's Die Hard with a Vengeance... and it's from here that the viewer must let go of any serious plot line if they wish to continue enjoying it.Similarities aside, the movie is rather enjoyable. Even the semi-Neo style CGI fight scene from the Matrix doesn't entirely ruin it, and this is because of the whodunit style plot that will keep most viewers guessing.So with a potential 'I've copied the most movies this year' Oscar on the horizon, the film is worth a watch, but not at the cinema.",The Commuter

There is deduction. More importantly, the process of deduction. Besides making observations of his own, Michael leverages on his personal connections with other frequent commuters to help solve the mystery in a believable way.The action sequences have far fewer cuts than something like the Taken trilogy, especially the second fight (granted, there are hidden cuts). Hence the fights are much easier to follow.More realistic injuries. People can get injured in a fight and do get injured, and not every side-character who got injured suffers instant death.If you already like action thrillers, then this one is certainly above average in that category.

Some of those enjoy the inherently isolating nature of a long train ride. This film is not one of them. The first 5 minutes of the film is really a piece of brilliant exposition. It's worth 2 stars on its own. Through 2 second spliced images and character interaction, we are able to formulate a good assessment of the protagonist without the need for the trite dialogue and over-blown exposition. It might have worked out brilliantly from there if, rather than following in the B-movie footsteps of ""Horror Express"", piling up bodies and ridiculous effects, the film took a more Hitchcock-ian approach to the subject of finding a mystery passenger on the ""Hudson North"" (really Metro North, but apparently they had an issue with Trademark)Problem 1: this isn't a long train ride through the Caucus mountain of Russia. It's a short 90 minute jaunt on a smelly, impersonal commuter rail line. One of the busiest in the world. Apparently a new stop has been added between between Grand Central Station and 125th St. And apparently it's normal to get off at 125th St. to get a drink after work. Just some very basic research by the writers should have revealed this to be ridiculous. And yet, in the first case of lazy writing in the film, those things stand out as quite critical to escalation of mystery and tension to the plot.Problem 2: after building up an every-man character who sells insurance, the writers apparently picked up the wrong character study sheets and determined that they were writing action set-pieces for John McClane. This doesn't shock the audience the way it was intended - the movie doesn't even try for a ""you picked the wrong guy"" moment like the one that carried the action in ""Taken"". We just get a bumbling retired Cop who can't approach 7 passengers and ask them their name. That would be too easy, and of course they could lie. But if they were apt to lie abou that, they are just as apt to lie about the myriad of things he attempts to elicit from them. Problem 3: The ultimate shaky premise -- the FBI doesn't have a car. I don't want to say more without putting up a spoiler, so let's just say that somehow the FBI is involved in this picture, and they have dropped the ball in such ridiculous ways that they are letting NYPD ""pull jurisdiction"" on them (sorry, it works the other way -- fed's pull jurisdiction), have less situational awareness and situation control training than a 60 year old retired cop turned insurance salesman, and also apparently don't have a car.

206,MichaelNontonMulu,Another Cool Liam Neeson Action Thriller Movie,7,18 January 2018,"What was wonderful about seeing Liam Neeson was that he had such a commanding presence on screen that it felt whenever he was in a movie playing a tough guy, he really nailed it. In here, he played a character who was being suppressed so hard that he had no choice but to fight back, and boy he really fought.As usual, he would be able to do the fight skillfully but not in the very fast style a la Jason Statham or Donnie Yen but his own style which was brutal and kind of like a street fight. In here, all the fights done were good, but my most favorite would definitely be the one in the small compartment before the final stop. Apart from the cool fight scenes, there were also various intense moments involving the train. The train's high speed sequence towards the end was absolutely breath taking and so intense that I was literally holding my breath. And I know my wife also screamed a little during some of those awesomely done intense moments.For a movie that was shot mostly in a confined space of a train, the early part of the film was a bit too long to my personal opinion. This resulted to a bit of a slow pace at the start. Not until the scene in the train did we feel the movie picking up the pace. Personally I think that if the earlier part was made a bit shorter, the movie would have been a nonstop thrill. To tell you the truth, I also felt a bit of similarity with another Liam Neeson's movie Non-Stop where the scenes were mostly done in an airplane. This should not come as a surprise since both were directed by the same person Jaume Collet-Sera who also directed few other Neeson's movies such as Unknown and Run All Night. I found that the sound effects of the movie was excellent and the special effects were good. It also provided us some twists and an interesting plot of finding out who the person was which kept us guessing till almost the end. The opening sequence was uniquely done but may seemed a bit confusing first, though after a while you would understand it better. The movie's main attraction would definitely be Liam Neeson who already built up a rapport for being an action star even at his age. I pretty much enjoyed the movie as it was truly entertaining though I would have loved it more had the intensity started a lot earlier. Overall it was a good entertaining movie, and one that should be enjoyed as an action thriller film.So if you are a fan of Liam Neeson and want to see his collaboration with Jaume Collet-Sera again, then this should be a definite choice. If you like this kind of genre, you would surely be entertained. And it is worth to note that during this Award period in January where the movie options were limited to heavy drama (or a horror movie), then this could be a good alternate movie.For my complete review, pls have a look at michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id",The Commuter

There are some films that are so bad that, probably out of a surfeit of masochism, one is compelled to grit the teeth and watch until the end just to see if it is as awful as it appears at first.
This is not one of those movies: it's so preposterous, such a jarring audio experience, that even my masochism had enough after half an hour. That's 30 minutes: 1800 seconds I'll never get back.

Don't know how they did it but it shows actual fist to face contact of Liam getting his ass kicked. Very few viewer obscured camera angle trick shots. I could tell it was CG'ed but in a way that introduced blur that actually amplified the impact. A bit strange and unsettling effect that made me feel more sorry for Liam's character. The plot is intricate and believable. They do explain how Liam as an insurance salesman knows how to fight so they're not insulting the audience's intelligence. It all makes sense just like Liam's ""Taken"" movies. Grounded with a very mature tone, a welcomed respite from the current super hero venues.

214,fletcherc21,Decent Thriller Derailed by Ridiculous Third Act,6,15 January 2018,"SPOILER: The Commuter delivers what it promises, a Liam Neeson action movie that relies on tension and a little bit of mystery to fill out its runtime. It begins very well with minimal exposition for the set up, using images or short conversations to explain what most movies would carve out five minutes of dialogue for. From there it evolves more like a mystery with an ordinary man in an extraordinary situation searching for someone on the train. As it enters the third act, it goes full action movie with explosions, fight scenes, and massive stakes. While this was to be expected from Jaume Collet-Serra, it undermines what had been a more contained thriller up to that point.It is shot well enough and uses an ensemble cast well, but no one besides Liam Neeson really has too much to do. Vera Farmiga and Jonathan Banks are both talented actors that are really underutilized. All in all, The Commuter is another Liam Neeson action movie that could be best described as ""Nonstop on a train.""",The Commuter

218,neobateman,Hitchcockian like entertainment until the fuse blows.,6,21 July 2018,"The Commuter is the fourth collaboration between director Jaume Collet-Serra and Academy Award nominated actor, Liam Neeson. In the passed years Neeson has morphed himself into a Tom Cruise like action hero with films like Taken and the previous collabs with Collet-Serra (Unknown, Non-Stop and Run all Night). This film has an interesting subject matter, insurance salesman Michael MacCauley (Liam Neeson) rides in and out via train every day for the past 10 years. When he falls into financial difficulties, he is offered a tempting task. On his ride home, he is approached by a mysterious woman (Vera Farmiga) to find a person that doesn't belong on this train, if he finds set person he will receive 100,000 dollars. I found the initial premise to be incredibly interesting as it sets up a moral dilemma. The woman makes it very clear that set person Michael has to find may receive harm, but this won't have to affect Michael. A dilemma such as this, we have seen many times before including that of Hitchcock's filmography. However the film still manages to engage the audience through a great performance by Liam Neeson. He plays the quintessential American citizen, living in a instabil world post the Wall Street crash of 2008. His initial reaction is believable and causes the audience to think whether they would do the same. Much of the camera work is also excellent, many different movements and tricks give this film a psychological edge. For example the famous vertigo effect is implemented very well into the movie. However as the film progresses, I found to be less and less invested. The film unfortunately fell into the same action movie tropes we knew from the last collaborations Neeson has done with the director. The film is still enjoyable for it, especially if you liked the previous films they have done together. In conclusion, the Commuter is an incredibly enjoyable thriller that unfortunately morphs into this action movie formula too quick. I wanted to see more of the moral dilemma and the psychological effects it has on Michael. Neeson gives a terrific performance, making the portrayal of an everyday man caught in this situation realistic and fun. However after about 1/3 into the film, it betrays this thriller tone and turns into a generic action movie, which still has enjoyable moments but overall left much to be desired.",The Commuter

Aside from the protagonist's invincibility and the directing that was very distracting at times, by the end of the film I had to witness a few of those infamous moments that generally aim to deliver some kind of comic relief to the situation, and the ending itself was pretty much an overly cathartic, almost disneyan ending.",The Commuter

It's always a delicate balance between developing characters and plot in an action flick. You don't want it too wordy, but not so rushed that the audience missed the cause and effect.The first hour or so is more suspense and character building, peppered with some brief humour. The last 40 minutes featured some interesting fight scenes involving unconventional weaponry :) a predictable yet visually impressive collision, and case solving scenes that remind me of the Negotiator.Considering it's a B grade budget production, it's forgivable that The Commuter had some plots derivative of Speed, Negotiator, Unstoppable, and Neeson's own Non-Stop and Unknown. Some stunts were exaggerated as expected, but at his age, Neeson did a fine job. The suspense and characters of this movie is more fun to watch than Non-Stop and Flight Plan, both of which ran on suspense to a point of paranoia and irrational actions. The interactions between the villains and Neeson in this movie were short and sweet, not too preachy. Characters' motives and decisions were not too far fetched, so I didn't roll my eyes or fast forward the movie.As an action thriller with $30M budget, this is much more efficient than the sentimental solo revenge ""Peppermint"", which barely had any memorable supporting characters and variety of action scenes.

A misterious woman with a curious offer.
A mistery to be solved...and little time to do it.
And a cast of very talented actors....what could go wrong? You will slowly, but surely, find the answer to that question.Because this movie is a slow burner, but unfortunately it is the audience the one that goes on fire.The first 20 minutes of the movie are great. Beautiful cinematics. Great acting. Everything is totally belieavable. Then you get to the main plot, and it is there where things start going awry, but in a way so subtle that only afterwards you realize what has really happened.A totally belieavable beginning lead us to a mistery that already requests us to suspend misbeief, but just a little. So we do. We anticipate great things and are willing to pay the price of overlooking a bit of fantasy here and there.And here we are, half way through the movie, knowing that the movie is about, and having to provide more and more concessions to fantasy in order to keep your viewing experience. How could the bad guys know this or that? Well...because of...reasons? You want to stay focus on the plot, and wish for a comeback of the great and realistic beginning of the movie. But that is nothing more than wishful thinking, because this train is already on its way to hell.As we pass the first hour mark our old and tired hero is no longer. He has gone from a very believable character to a clown making unnecesary populist remarks to evil bankers to...darkman? Taken? How old is that guy again?By the time to arrive at the last 30 minutes everything in the movie is out of control. The plot disintegrates as the characters nonsensically switch from love to hate acording to the movie requirements. Everything goes 80s sci-fi in front of your eyes, fire and explosions and you could not care less.The last 10 minutes of the movie is an attempt to go back to the old times when everything used to make sense, but by then the audience knows how all will end. And sadly, the movie delivers. By the time it is all said and done you know you need to leave the theater, you don't even care for the credits, but yet you stay and are rewarded with an epilogue that is the cheesy culmination of all this mess. I cannot tell whether this is injury to the insult we witness during the second half of the movie, or the director really felt the need of closure. I have no idea.So why 5 stars? Because the premise is good, and the first half is enjoyable. It is a movie that had the right people, the right money, the right plot, so it deserves those points.

Nothing make sense, literally, NOTHING: 1) The nemesis, Joanna (played by Farmiga), who is off the train, seem to know every single move MacCauley (played by Neeson) made throughout the entire event, she was always able to call him at the exact moment each critical task was completed, how did she pull it off? No logical explanation is ever given to the audience2) It's even more ridiculous, when Joanna called MacCauley to witness through the train window, a random passenger Walt (played by Banks), who just got off the train, being shoved in front of a bus, because MacCauley stealthily slipped Walt a note asking him to contact the police. How did Joanna find out? We don't know. How could Joanna time the whole sequence of events so perfectly (sent her accomplice after Walt, anticipate there will be a bus coming, anticipate MacCauley has a straight line of sight to see Walt being pushed on a street at least a block away from the train platform, how does she know Walt will even take that route, ...), we don't know.3) Train derailed at 70 m/hr., but all windows intact, none of the remaining passengers seemed to have a scratch4) After the train derailed, none of the passengers seemed too eager to get off the train. And they weren't being held hostage5) While being surrounded by scores of police + FBI agents, a rogue police officer Murphy (played by Wilson), stepped onto the train, pretending to negotiate for hostage release, but with real intent to kill the witness. Keep in mind, there are at least 10 passengers on the train at the time, and the police seem to be using some sort of heat-signature technology to watch every movement inside the train car. So what is the end game here? Does Murphy intent to commit mass murder to eliminate all passengers, while FBI is watching outside? If not, how does he intend to get away with murder if the rest of passengers just saw him kill the witness? 6) Why the FBI send the witness on the train, instead of picking her up? Won't that put the witness in unnecessary danger? 7) If the rogue and ""powerful"" organization know exactly where the FBI will pick up the witness (Cold Spring), won't it be easier just send a hitman squad to kill the witness + FBI agents at destination? Why even bother to derail a train and kill everyone on board? Both carry a death sentence anywayHow? How? How? How? How? How? How? How?",The Commuter
230,kashidomar,A satisfactory thriller with a few distractions..........,8,10 January 2018,The movie is quite a good movie and i really think movie lovers should go at it . It is a thrill spiced movie with many suspenses and hidden turns in the story . The movie flows around a commuter train and builds all the potential actions and dramas around it. Nice to see Liam Neeson in the central role . He has done extremely well and he has delivered these stuffs to us for many times. Actions are pretty new and mindblowing.

It is a movie about a man who has taken the train for the past 10 years who is offered a ""hypothetical"" situation to find a person on the train. He does not know who it is and neither do we.What I liked about this movie was the deductive reasoning behind the movie plot. It kept me engaged. You as the viewer are constantly trying to figure out who the person is along with the main character, Michael McCauley. I kept thinking to myself the person is (insert character). The problem with this suspenseful thriller is that it lacks the action packed sequences associated with other great action movies of the past. Because of this there are certain ""reality"" checks that happen throughout the film. The plot of the film is never really explained in any great detail so you are constantly wondering along with the main character why the person everyone is looking for is so important. You get a brief explanation, but nothing more. The movie just does not have the same plot and main character development as a movie like Taken. This is a one-time have fun at the movies film with enough action and suspense to be good enough so you stay interested throughout. For that, I recommend seeing the movie.",The Commuter

The Commuter, not so much.Both the action and plot were disappointing. The beginning montage was too long and fill and could easily have been shortened to edit out unnecessary scenes and the length of the movie. Or add some coherence to the plot.It could have been a good psychological thriller, but never took it beyond a few scenes. He barely strained his conscience. Then it tried to be an action movie, but wasn't coherent or fulfilling as that. His mission on the train was him roaming back and forth in a panic and trying to call for help. A more intelligent selection process would have made up for a lot of the silly physicality of the stunts. There were some red herrings, but nothing really interesting.Then, other than a train crash, there's absolutely no explanation of the villians. They are omnipotent, except for the main plot point. We never know who they are. And the last scene... Just skipped ahead without any backstory. A lot of wasted potential. There are struggling writers who could have done better.",The Commuter
233,christian-larson,Entertaining action thriller,6,22 January 2018,"The Commuter is the latest Liam Neeson action movie about how Michael needs to resolve the situation he is in. Its very unusual for Liam Neeson to be bad in a movie. He is really good here as he gives a very physical performance and he is convincing as this ex-cop. The directing here is surprisingly really good as there are many creative choices made to the story to make it above-average. The pacing is also really quick and fun as it has no scene that drags. The acting overall is good, nothing awful, nothing amazing. The only actor that is really great is Liam Neeson, the rest are fine. The script is probably my biggest issue here. The script is very obvious and its made for the audience to understand everything and there is no subtlety, which could have made the movie better. The story is very cliched, and there was rarely a moment that surprised me, aside from the directing. The cinematography can go to awful to great. There is a scene in which Michael is talking with a former friend. And the camera work is so horrific, i was getting dissy. It was hand-held and it was shaking. I didn't understood why did the director made that choice, but it was distracting. But later there is a really good action scene which is tricked to be filmed without takes. So the cinematography is 50/50 for me. Overall, this is a really entertaining movie and a very well directed one.

240,jamesnicholls-58600,Slightly disappointing for a Liam Neeson action movie,6,11 June 2019,"My main issue with this film is the lack of backstory, complexity and personality to the vast majority of the characters in it and therefore as a result I didn't connect to any of the characters at all except the main character to a slight extent. For a film that has no predecessors this film had too many characters and too much action to develop any of the characters properly, most of the characters only had 3 or 4 lines so the characters in this were overall poor and unmemorable, the villains were also one dimensional from what I could tell and just like all the other characters lacked a lot of personality and backstory. I thought the first 10 minutes of the film was really boring but it did get a lot better once Michael met the main villain on the train.But the somewhat decent action scenes and the suspense of the plot kept me watching the film right until the end, the action scenes are really what make this movie without them it would be essentially nothing. It did have a few good non-action moments but these were few and far between, I found the main villain talking about personality types interesting but unfortunately she didn't go into much detail into that so I felt that was a wasted opportunity and it could've had so much more potential.The film's question of whether one would accept a stranger's request to find someone with a bag on the train without question for thousands of dollars was also a nice concept to think about to a certain extent after it became clear they wanted Prin dead. Because of lack of character development I didn't feel very emotional or deeply connected to the film whilst watching it at all so that was disappointing. Complexity wise, the film isn't very complex at all the only somewhat complex thing about it was pretty much when Michael was asking two other blokes on the train whether they would do what he did as is a slightly complex tricky question for the viewer to decide whether they would themselves do it. The rest of the film was pretty much a slugfest with the main character trying desperately to find the identity of a random person who got barely any screen time or character development and trying very hard to save his Son and Wife who also didn't get a lot of character development at all so their essentially strangers to the viewer. So overall the film doesn't leave a lot to deeply think about. It wasn't a bad movie, it was watchable and it could've been a lot more boring.

The character motivation lacks clarity: Liam Neeson plays an extremely loyal ex-cop family man whose hired to murder someone. To me, I don't buy it because the hysterical macho melodramatics overemphasizes the financial debt that Michael faces as well as his family being kidnapped.

Simply stated, Alex goes into the wagon unarmed and with a camera that separates him from everyone else, by displaying him a different color in the infrared scopes of the snipers that will eventually end the fight. At a major turning point in that scene, Michael is forced to turn the gun over to Alex. That should've ended the situation right there, as the snipers should've realized that their man was now in control, and make their move or give directions for other members of the SWAT to intervene. Intentionally or not, the filmmakers chose to ignore that fact and stay with the action inside the derailed railroad car. Error becomes ever worse when later on, Michael warns another passenger not to pick up the gun, that has fallen on the floor while he and Alex are fighting. The design is completed when Michael removes the transmitter and makes it look like he's the officer they send in, and he's about to die by the person who was send in there to negotiate with.

Having to suspend disbelief is common for many movies, but The Commuter asks that you also suspend your common sense and any understanding you might also have of human nature or physics. From the moment Liam Neeson boards the train, there is no decision, action or technical detail which makes any sense at all.The movie's vertiginous opening sequence is meant to convey that Neeson's life is stuck in a rut, while the next few scenes convey how desperate he might be. Keep in mind, however, that we're talking Liam Neeson, who's a former cop who now sells life insurance. (What?) Once aboard the train, he's approached by Vega Farmiga. Neeson and Farmiga? Ah, I think, life doesn't get better that this. Foolish boy.Farmiga makes him an offer he can't refuse. And one which we can't understand: He has about an hour to find one particular passenger - on a crowded commuter train - carrying a bag and using ""Prynne"" as an alias. No problem. Faced with that task, the movie slowly devolves into a mashup of ""Clue"" and ""Murder on the Orient Express"" as Neeson tries to find the passenger. Much hilarity does not ensue.Although the plot makes no sense, at least, I thought, I could look forward to Neeson's ""Popeye"" moment: ""That's all I can stands, I can't stands no more."" In The Commuter, however, even that moment is disappointing as it's both watered down and of his own making.The one redeeming facet of the movie is the excellent cast. While Neeson appears in almost every scene, Farmiga unfortunately appears in person only briefly. Other cast members include Patrick Wilson, Jonathan Banks, Sam Neill and Elizabeth McGovern, along with lots of great actors playing passengers. Notable among those with bit parts is Florence Pugh, fresh off her award-winning star-turn in Lady Macbeth.Do not see this movie in a theater, do not stream the movie or rent the DVD, and consider cancelling your cable, Internet and cell services to minimize the chance that you might accidentally encounter it.",The Commuter

It is PLOTTED with such a heavy hand (who wants to kill Miss Prynne, and who is she? or he? or whatever . . . ) And why should Nathaniel Hawthorne's ""Scarlet Letter"" be dragged into this mess? How clever!?!?! The poor actors are badly misused and abused by this atrocious script. For example: there is an expression in film criticism that complains of a performance ""He (she) could have called it in."" That means that the role is so beneath the ability and dignity of the actor that the role could have been called in as a casual multi-task chore while going to the bathroom, fixing breakfast, or driving the kids to school. And ""calling it in"" is literally what happens to the wonderful actress Vera Farmiga--reduced for the great majority of the movie to a reedy voice on the phone, reading the ridiculous script.

257,Grumphy,Just a one way ticket please,5,18 January 2018,"The CommuterStory is a bit. Well. What do you expect? It's a full on action flick. Though it has some redeeming moments, a few clever twists or turns can't save it from the banality that it promises (and delivers). To clarify, there are more not-quite-so-clever twists. Acting is okay. Though as of late, Liam seems to be doing mostly more action oriented projects for some reason, he has skills that he's acquired over a decently long career and know how to use them. Even if he has to play roles as inane as principled ex cop with money troubles on a train. His co stars, or co passengers, pull something around their own weight. They play their parts as they are, they're not really playing characters, with little time (or need) for development. The jerk is a jerk, the teenage girl is a teenage girl, the random friend is a random friend etc. Visually the film is laughable at times. It's not Scorpion King level bad, but the CGI is terrible. On the plus side, those moments add to fun. I guess. Also the camerawork tends to go overboard for no reason other than... I don't know. It looks cool? It might've if they wouldn't have mixed it with bad CGI. These sort of things tends to happen when you've got nothing to show. Fight screens are decent(ish).Sound or music wise I'm trying to remember if there is anything to comment. I can't think of anything so I'm putting it on the plus side. Emotions and atmosphere seem written, not to say forced. The director Jaume Collet-Serra was either offered a lot of money to do this or he is also very principled and does not negotiate with terrorists. He should, however, make an exception and try to negotiate with the producers, because this could've been a totally different kind of film. But everybody likes fireworks I guess.

Liam Neeson plays an ex cop now working as a successful life insurance salesman who's life gets turned upside down one fateful day at work. The majority of the movie takes place on the train commute journey after work.

Although it was predictable about the mystery, the script was not bad. But I'm really asking, did we need a movie like this after the Non-Stop movie? Especially in a movie that does not bring any innovation. This is just same movie with Non-Stop. Actors, screenplay, characters are different but story processing same.And this time, as with Non-Stop, the mystery is not very interesting. You're not interested in who Prynne is, because the film gives you a limited choice and you don't even wonder who Prynne is because the characters it offers are hollow. The right option is never the main focus in the film, which makes it difficult for us to predict. Is that a good thing? It's a good thing that the film can hide who the mysterious character is. But if you never focus on the character in the film you just show her face in the intermediate scenes, it doesn't make us feel anything. It only causes us to say okay. The other mystery is a predictable event that has been given signals from the beginning.This film also has nice, fun scenes like Non-Stop but not enough. If you haven't seen the Non-Stop, maybe you can have fun with this movie. If you don't like this movie and if you're looking for this kind of movie, I can suggest you give the Non-Stop a chance because the scenario is better than this movie. Non-Stop also doing same things right according to this film.

Still I have to admit, dignity aside, my day was slightly better because of it.Sitting just between good and bad on the spectrum, I suppose the polite euphemism for this movie is to say that it was ""familiar."" In fact, you could probably recreate this film, shot for shot, out of footage from other Liam Neeson movies. 
While it's my sincere hope that this Ikea version of film craftsmanship is a fad, I also have to acknowledge the fact that - though, The Network, this wasn't - they told us exactly what they were giving us in the trailer, and they delivered on that promise (unlike other shit-bomb murder on a train movies released in the last six months).The acting was good, the action wasn't bad and the story was decent (I know that because if it wasn't, they probably wouldn't keep recycling it film after film) but familiarity breeds boredom, and suffice to say, even first time moviegoers seemed to instinctively smell the silent but deadly twists and red herrings bubbling up before they were squeaked out into the stale theater air.If you've seen everything else, you might wanna give this one a try but otherwise just earmark it for a good Redbox rental to have on in the background while you clean-out your inbox in a couple months.And now, an open letter to all terrorists, murderers, kidnappers, and otherwise: I know it's not easy running a business that's largely opportunistic, especially in this climate. I know this is an industry where things can go wrong in a moments notice, leaving you with little else aside from improvisation; Shit happens.

The action scenes, which are quite a few, are well filmed most of the time and inserted when needed but some of them feel too forced and stupid. 
At times, I found myself feeling that I was watching Non-stop yet again, the plot and action being that movie: Liam is some sort of ex-cop/fed agent in a confined space, forced by bad guys to do something. 
The film is not great, it's a good action thriller with Liam Neeson, perhaps that's what makes this movie decent and worth to watch at least once.",The Commuter
299,JAS0NTURNER,So lame but I watched the whole thing,5,17 June 2020,This movie was predictable from the title but I held out hope it would have a twist.

300,skg009,Quite an exciting ride,7,24 April 2018,"I had to write a review after I saw Tommen Baratheon as the son of Mike (Liam Neeson). For the whole movie, I just couldn't get who the guy was until the last shot and wow, wasn't I amazed. He is alive and well. Now to the movie. Just like Classic Liam, the movie is fast paced, decent story line and drama. It's a clear cut cat and mouse chase movie. Liam does what he does best, be the action hero. I'm amazed at how a 60 yrs old Mike (Liam) could do the stunts that he is seen doing without injuring any major muscle part of his body. I'm 35 and I ruptured my ligament while playing football. Mike, I'm sure, will have no issues playing rugby at this age. There is nothing more to write about the movie apart from the fact that it's a fun ride to watch and proves why only Liam can pull of these movies at this age. His voice reminds you constantly of 'I don't know who you are..' dialogue. His facial expression revolves around from a normal office going insurance guy to a trained assassin, which I believe, is not so cool point. But, who cares, it's Liam and just enjoy watching him.

I thought it was a strange choice but, as Taken showed, it actually worked really well. However that fact he's now churned out 4/5 of the same film since then, it's starting to wear a little thin. As good an actor as he is, it's getting hard to distinguish between the personas he's played now in Taken/Unknown/Non-Stop and now The Commuter. Luckily there's a decent thriller/mystery plot to keep the film ticking over, solid performances from Neeson and the rest of the cast and a nicely chilling turn from Vera Farmiga. Some of the action, especially late on, gets a little OTT and silly (with some god awful CGI/green-screen) but all in all there's a pretty solid movie, story and acting holding it all together.

308,darrelltill,An incomprehensible and disappointing waste of everybody's time.,2,12 February 2019,"Here's my point of view - I don't normally like ""brainless"" action films, but against type I really like the 'Taken' franchise because they build tension and Liam Neeson's character, while stereotypical, is so confidently cool you can't help but like him. So, I was hoping this film would be similar.First thing to notice about the film is that despite being set in the USA the cast are predominantly British, normally a good sign. But everything about the film is terrible. The script is corny from beginning to end and contains almost nothing original. The setup is ridiculous and becomes even moreso as the film goes on. And it does ""go on"". The action stays on the train, but there isn't much of that as the film attempts to become a ""whodunnit"" rather than an action film. And no, I'm not criticising a film for not being ""an action film"" - it isn't very good at what it attempts to be, either. Everything about it is cheap and screams ""student film project"", from the cliched 'dolly-zoom' effect when the not-so-obvious dawns on the hero, to the terrible dialogue and stereotypical characterisation - among the ""varied"" characters (aside from Neeson's ex-cop-turned-insurance-salesman) are a grungey teen, a businessman, a quietly spoken woman, all stuck on a train together in a crisis situation. The surprise antagonist? The ex-cop's former partner.I don't like the hackneyed phrase ""that's 90 minutes of my life I'm never getting back"", because nobody gets any time back for anything, ever. But Liam Neeson probably spent a lot more time on this and at 66 years of age should probably be spending his time more wisely.",The Commuter

But if you put Liam Neeson on it in a good story plot on a movie like this it never gets old with him, it always end up interesting, thrilling and really gripping mystery how it will all unfold to the end. It started with some offered something for someone and he went haywire just going back and forth the train cars looking for this Prin"", ha... no spoilers so I'll stop here. It reminded me a bit of the movie the Murder on the Orient Express but that was bit long dragging but okay, on this movie The Commuter it's much more thrilling and gripping as the story unfolds, ain't boring. I really liked this one with Lian Neeson, may not be as good as Non-Stop which feels similar but different circumstances but if you like Non-Stop or his Taken movies you'll like this one too, promise.

310,pinkfloydian,What a surprise!,10,12 January 2020,"I am so pleased with the viewing of this movie that I had to come to write my explanation of a 10 start rating. We all (at least we should) know that it is rare to find That Movie. You probably know what I mean. I don't think there's that many movies capable of leaving me with a feeling of having contemplated something simply... perfect (and I don't think I'm that picky). You may find me as if I'm surprised with my own rating. You may find this somehow contradictory. That's all very true. I think this it's due to it's genre, it's message (or the lack of one)... and these seem enough reasons for any very reasonable person never rate a movie like this with 10 stars. Let's face it, this is an action movie with its twists and turns. This is entertainment. I'm remembering T2 Judgement Day. T2 was an amazing action movie that was probably seen by everybody on the planet. Packed with many memorable scenes, incredible visual effects, great acting, an intelligent screenplay with an ever present message about humanity and to top all that... The Perfectness. It placed the genre in another level, like James Cameron do. I agree that The Commuter can never be placed at the same level... but it is incredible in his own way! From start to finish it surprised me with many beautiful cinematography technical details than enriched the whole movie. It may not have as many action scenes as, for example, a Taken movie but there are enough to make it's pace always intense and very bloody well choreographed! It was incredible how these guys took the best creative advantage of the tight space of a train to film this. Amazing! And the plot was quite interesting, keeping me glued to the screen throughout the whole movie. These guys should (and must) be very proud of what they did here. Congratulations and thank you!",The Commuter

By not showing her much during the search phase of the movie confirmed my initial guess that she's the one.

You see Most a times we read the reviews before actually watching these movies, and apparently that takes a great chunk of the mystique and overall satisfaction that that movie deserves. I for one usually recommend movie watchers just let every thing fall in place and then let your expectations progress as you carry on with the movie.

T²C² - Tongue To Cheek Celluloid -
I thought Harrison Ford was the most irresponsible parent ever. He has lost track of his family and had them taken by the IRA, CIA and even SAG..
But Neeson has taken this and commutes it to a whole new level. In a film with more crashes than a Ford (pilot) One assumed his family would go missing at some point. But irrespective of the cliché, even with somewhat familiar plot lines and devices , the director, somehow has managed to create a suspense filled thriller. In Leeson you know what you're getting when you see his work , a steadfast no nonsense hardball character. A tough guy armed with the right rationale to justify anything that you would too. .He even shows his frailty and glimpses of empathy in moments, building yours. And all the while playing a character with an Irish accent. Just as well as Eminem played a rapper. Farmigia was well cast. Even with a fairly predictable plot and a few cliché overkills in the big finish, the solid actors pull off the suspense. No doubt, the audience was enthralled.

I also like the feel of an old-fashioned Alfred Hitchcock movies. Of course, no one can meet Hitchcock standards, but the flavor was there.

A story middle class life being ripped apart by upper class greed, which sees an ex cop turned salesman used as a pawn in a high stakes murder coverup. Nielsons character arc goes from a nice safe financial life selling insurance suddenly into one of desperation and greed himself after he's fired without any kind of safety net. An opportunity to sure up his dire finances suddenly appears, but with it a massive amount of pressure as he's asked to solve an odd mystery and tag a witness for murder. The shadowy baddies, who use unwilling perps to commit their crimes for them, makes for an interesting metaphor of the deep state left wing government.

The second and third acts are ludicrously bad, the plot falls apart with terrible cliched dialogue which is only matched by truly awful CGI.I'm not against the action thriller genre, and there are plenty of examples where far fetched plots and over the top CGI work, mainly because films like Die Hard don't take themselves that seriously and are pitched at just being entertaining. This appalling movie manages to none of that. This isn't a good screenplay poorly executed, this is a terrible script poorly executed. It's hard to understand why actors of the caliber of Neeson, Neil & Farmiga couldn't predict how awful this movie was going to turn out from the script alone.

But unfortunately, after his action/revenge movie Taken became a major hit, he is being typecasted for similar kind of roles. Lately his movies have been such individual centric action flicks. Commuter is no different. Infact, it is a sub-way/tube version of his movie Non Stop (2014). I hope the casting directors watch his earlier classics like Schindler's List and give him better roles.There is nothing much to tell about the plot. Liam Neeson is a former cop who got fired from his insurance executive job. As he makes way back to his home, whose mortgage he may not be able to pay, in his usual route on a tube, he encounters a mysterious woman played by charming Vera Farmiga. She puts him in a tough spot and Liam has to do a task to come out of it. To know the rest you have to watch the movie. Do not want to spoil it.The movie is slow paced and only picks up the speed in the last quarter of it. There are no spectacular action scenes like the ones in Non Stop.

And while I held my breath for the former policeman and just-fired insurance salesman he portrayed in The Commuter, I have to ask why he's taking on these lesser characters in the last few years. His characters have usually been highly-principled men who keep to the moral road and favor diplomacy over violence to solve dilemmas, despite character flaws. I can only imagine it's because roles for actors become more scarce as they pass age 50, whether male or female. Still, with his reputation, I'm hard pressed to justify these latter choices of roles.It is his performance in The Commuter that compels me to give an 8/10 rating to this movie, although several other actors performed well and the suspense factor attacked me with unbearable anxiety.",The Commuter

357,daniel_haddad,Action-less plot guessing repeat,4,20 January 2018,"The Commuter (2018) is an action-packed mystery film without a lot of the action one would have expected given actor Liam Nesson's cinematic background recently. With several slow scenes and a drawn out story line, this is not one of Neeson's better films. The film is about a business man who is down on his luck and finds himself as a player in a crime conspiracy during his normal commute home. Nesson plays his traditional bad-ass ex-cop type role very well- though one has to wonder if he is tired of his one-dimensional characters. The story itself was rather slow and it seemed to be drawn out more than it should have been. There was little character development throughout the film and I was left wanting more from just about all of it. To be fair to writers Byron Willinger and Philip de Blasi, it is a challenge to have a 105 minute feature film set in essentially one location. They tried to do the most, however, the plot followed a generic story-line format of ""guy who is given a morally questionable task and then struggles with the decision of right and wrong"" and did not provide the big twist I would have expected in this type of mystery film. It once again, followed the generic plot twist one could have guessed about a third of the way through the film. Overall, The Commuter is not nearly as good as one would have hoped. Without a new and good plot, this action lacking film will not live up to most standards.",The Commuter

Because - even when his movies does suck, Neeson himself always brings it to the table and saves the day. Never halfa$$sed day at work. And so sympathetic it always shines through in his characters.
Okay. That being said. This movie has a decent storyline. Everything's not good in it -- far from it -- but he's just bringing us to the finish line one more time and I'm amazed. The guy is 66 or 67, and looks ripped for a 35 year old.

One day, on his daily commute back to the suburbs, a woman named Joanna (Vera Farmiga, another Collet-Serra veteran from his truly absurd 2009 horror Orphan), approaches Michael with a tantalizing offer: If he can identify a passenger ""who shouldn't be here"" by the time the train hits the end of the line, he'll get $100,000. If not, his wife and teenage son die.Don't think about the story too much, because no one else does. Red herrings are packed into the train cars like sardines and each new twist seems to contradict the one that came before it. The film also indulges in the Law & Order Rule, wherein the real villain is a giant mystery ... until you consider the familiar character actor who popped up in the beginning of the film and, hey, where did he go anyway?Instead of fretting about plot holes so large they could swallow a subway - unfortunately, no, this doesn't happen - focus on how well Neeson has become at playing a panicked paterfamilias, and how confidently Collet-Serra shoots the confined environs. There is some egregious CGI on display here when it comes to explosions and one long sequence shot that charts the train's length, but the director mostly relies on swooping in and around physical sets, and staging visceral fist fights.Driven by someone else, The Commuter could have derailed a dozen times over. But with Jaume Collet-Serra in the conductor's seat, and Neeson his increasingly eager attendant, the film stays on track.",The Commuter

They're harmless, fun and if Harrison Ford and Bruce Willis aren't making these type of movies anymore, somebody's got to.Liam Neeson is at it again doing his usually everyman with a hidden layer of special skills: the ability to connect audience with him and care about the stakes no matter how ridiculous the scenarios a plotline throws at him (this is probably Liam Neeson's ultimate superpower, in spite of being a Jedi Knight leader of the League of Shadows and god of Narnia and ancient Greece).While the film is squarely focuses on Liam Neeson's character, it also boasts a wide supporting cast. Because there's so many, and so little screen time to give them, they've got to make a noticeable impression quickly. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are the standouts, doing the most with what little time (and script) to work with. Farmiga in particular manages to create a long range of nuance and grayness in what is probably 3-5 minutes of screentime.The story itself is quite preposterous.

429,imran-01500,Nearly Perfect Action + Drama + Thriller Combination,8,16 January 2018,"I certainly loved this one. Even in the first scenes, the artistic style of the shooting has impressed me.The bond in the family was portrayed well. Though the movie followed a way other than I've expected, the way it followed was still cool. I expected a more emotional movie, it has gotten a more action after the intro scene.Still, the action and the trill was top-notch; character developments and interactions was really good. Also I liked the way Liam Neeson solves problems; The detective way of the movie was great too. Also the message that the movie gives is strong: first it implies that ""there is nothing noble in real world"" , but then the main character changes his way of seeing things and decides to do the right thing. That was pretty impressive decision to be honest.Still, it had some failures in my opinion. GCI was -not terrible, but still- significantly bad, and it didn't fit the way movie intended to follow. I really liked the thrilling scenes, but GCI kinda killed the mood for me. Also ending was a little bit lame, that I even thought ""this movie will be a bad one in my memory forever."" but, they managed to pull through.Overall, my review for the movie is that it was amazing, and all the actors, notably Liam Neeson, did a really impressive job i think.

488,xuandy-32094,"An overall enjoyable movie, although it lacks an exciting and satisfying conclusion, is a bit too ambitious with its primarily-on-train-setting, and there are stupid flaws.",6,31 May 2018,"The movie has an interesting concept. Criminals are looking for an informant on the train who is heading to the FBI with information that will blow the whistle on their operation. A mysterious lady entices Liam Neeson who has recently lost his job with money to find the informant although she masks what their intentions with the information are.He is a regular on the train and apparently because he was once a cop he has the skillz. It makes for a potentially unique thriller because he has to find the person on a train full of people in various creative ways and his family is in danger if he doesn't complete the task. Sounds good. However, because the setting is limited to the train, there isn't really much room for excitement or a more complex plot if that makes sense. Pretty much the bulk of the movie is Liam Neeson repeatedly awkwardly trying to get the passengers to reveal the contents of their bags in one way or another, and getting beat up by an undercover FBI agent who he thinks is the mysterious figure (he doesn't know that the person he's looking for is an informant). That makes no sense because as an undercover agent you aren't going to beat somebody up to blow your cover and it wouldn't even be legal to just randomly beat somebody up without a reason. He is an officer of the law, not a thug. But anyway it ultimately feels like a lot of the movie is filler. There's a few action scenes sprinkled around like him having to get back into the tran from underneath while it is moving. He doesn't go anywhere else interesting, you can't have an exciting chase scene, there isn't a very good antagonist, etc. The character development isn't good enough for the viewer to care about the fact that his family is in danger. Perhaps I am not a ""thriller"" person but surely a good thriller would have more than just anxiety and tension. They don't always have to be stuck in one location the entire film. Also, these criminals are pretty stupid. If it's so important to keep the informant quiet that it's worth $100000, they should have provided Neeson with more help. All they said to him was the person's destination and nickname. They didn't have other guys helping him look or special equipment to detect the hard drive or anything. Basically, it seems implausible that any human being with logic would say that the best option to take out the informant is to give a lot of money to some rando on the train so he can find it with barely any help. He didn't even know the fact that the way the tickets were stamped showed the destination until a while into the movie. And if it's so important to kill the informant that it's worth $100k, they already rigged the train with explosives to take out the brakes anyway. So why rely on a clueless person when you can just detonate the bomb before the train reaches the informant's destination and kill them easily when it derails? It's not like the criminals care about the other people's lives. If the informant is found, how are they going to secretly kill them without rousing alarm from other commuters? When they killed the thug undercover FBI agent by accident it was because this guy was roaming around on the empty cars of the train. But nobody would willingly follow a guy in a cloak to a secluded area just because he told them to, and he couldn't make the informant come with him because they are all surrounded by commuters. The criminals disable the A/C In every car except for one to put everybody together on the train, but it makes the situation worse because now the assassin can't easily assassinate the target. Well, finally Neeson saves the train passengers from a serious derailment after the bomb explodes, kills the corrupt cop who responds to the scene, and the informant safely makes it. Then after rejoining the force he finds the woman on the train and arrests her. It's an unepic ending in my opinion, because until the last few minutes of his life the viewers don't even know that the cop is corrupt, and he's pretty much shot without a major fight. The fight scene with the guitar guy was better. There are a few annoying logic flaws. Why did the FBI want the informant to come to them instead of them going to the informant's house? Why couldn't the data implicating the criminals from the hard drive just be uploaded to the internet and sent to the FBI instead of taking the whole hard drive? If the corrupt cop was already under investigation by the police department, why was he allowed to participate in the hostage situation? Why was the mysterious lady who lead Liam Neeson into this situation in the first place riding the train after all the events of the movie had occurred and the crime ring had been taken down? Did she want to get caught? The criminals stole Neeson's wife's ring as proof that they are in danger, but his family are still in the house and unaware that they are in danger, which is stupid because that meant that the crimnals had to stealthily sneak into the house, figure out where the ring is (it could be in the bathroom, hidden in the mess on the dresser, in a hidden box, anywhere), all while staying hidden to the people in the house. Ludicrous! Also, the criminals shove Neeson's friend in front of a bus to kill him so he can't get to the cops across the street to get help. That is full of holes, because there is an entire crowd of witnesses and the cops across the street, so there would be no opportunity to escape. Overall the movie is interesting but not worth watching in my opinion.",The Commuter

492,smitchka,What Conspiracy?,3,6 May 2018,"Wheres the beef of this movie? Mike is supposed to kill Prynne to get the evidence regarding the death of a city planner thrown, pushed or jumped out of a building,or his wife And kid die. So why did the guy jump or be thrown out the window (by an alleged cop), whats, the conspiracy? Why did he go out the window? No explanation why? Why kill Prynne except as a witness with what evidence is she carrying. its too big to be a thumb drive, so what is it. Why did the guy fly out the window and why was Murphy involved. I know it supposed to be enigmatic & a ""mystery"", but it makes no sense with too many holes in it",The Commuter
