0,SnoopyStyle,hit and miss jokes,5,7 November 2013,"Mel Brooks hams it up big time. He's starring, writing, and directing this crazy Brooks version of history. It's a big hit and miss constant stream of broad jokes. At a lot of times, this feels dated like a vaudeville act from an age long gone.The biggest and best laughs have to be Madeline Kahn as Empress Nympho during Roman times. No No Yes Yes Yes No Yes Yes Yes. You've gotta love it.Although Gregory Hines is fine, I can't help but wonder what if Richard Pryor could be in this. It's a disappointment. And that's a big part of the disappointment in this movie. There is a lack of up and comer new comedians. This is mostly a reunion of old timers. With the rise of SNL and that comedic scene, the times are passing it by.",History of the World - Part I
1,mark.waltz,"Not a classic, but far from a clunker.",7,28 November 2015,"Parodying creation, the caveman film, the biblical epic, the crusades and the French Revolution, Mel Brooks got most of it right. There are only a few groaners, a few eye raisers and many genuine laughs, a few of them worthy of a Danny Thomas spit take.Utilizing humor styles perfected the year earlier with ""Airplane!"" while utilizing his familiar style of delicious bad taste, Brooks uses much of his regular crew of funny people. With dry narration by Orson Welles, Brooks goes all out to satirize the genre of phony Hollywood history. The highlights are the Roman Empire sequence with a delightfully hysterical performance by Madeline Kahn as an unnamed Roman empress, with a deliberately grotesque performance by Dom De Luise as the Emperor. Historical timing would show it as Tiberius as the scene moved to Judea on the night of the last supper. Ironically, John Hurt who played Caligula in TV's ""I Claudius"" plays Jesus in a cameo.The inquisition sequence is a parody just like ""Springtime For Hitler"" to show the atrocities against the Jewish population. It is semi- successful as long as you realize the point Brooks was making and the real history behind it.Some great art direction makes the French Revolution sequence better than it actually is although the cameos by several familiar faces is also of help. With Cloris Leachman standing out as the Dickens character Madam De Farce, that segment is raised a notch, just as the Roman Empire sequence was with its cameo by Bea Arthur.As for the coming attractions at the end, it now seems pointless, not only because there never was a sequel, but because it really isn't funny. So a in all a mixed bag, but middle of the road Brooks is certainly better than no Brooks.",History of the World - Part I
2,claudio_carvalho,It's Good to Be a King,7,10 April 2015,"Divided in six segments (""The Stone Age""; ""The Old Testament""; ""The Roman Empire""; ""The Spanish Inquisition""; ""The French Revolution""; and ""Previews of Coming Attractions""), ""History of the World: Part I"" is an uneven parody of historical moments, but still worthwhile watching. This film is written, directed and produced by Mel Brooks, who is also the lead actor performing five roles. It is also the debut of Gregory Hines, who died so young. Narrated by Orson Welles, the film has a great cast and cameo appearance of many famous people.Last but not the least, there is no sequel and Part I is another Mel Brook's joke, since Sir Walter Raleigh wrote The History of the World Volume 1 but was beheaded before writing the Volume 2. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""A História do Mundo: Parte I"" (""The History of the World: Part I"")",History of the World - Part I
3,classicsoncall,"""I coalesce the vapor of human experience into a viable and logical comprehension.""",7,29 April 2020,"I have a similar reaction to this film that I had with Mel Brooks' 1974 hit, ""Blazing Saddles"". Brooks is a genuinely funny writer and entertainer, so I don't get why he also goes for the lowest common denominator in his pictures. The idea of a dozen subjects dry humping the Queen or placing such a fascination on women's boobs is at best an infantile exercise in generating a laugh. To me it's just not funny, and there was just too much of it in this picture. On another note, Brooks doesn't fail to offend with jokes at the expense of ethnic and religious groups, often bordering on the irreverent and sacrilegious. For me, the best part of the movie were those sound and sight gags that generate a chuckle, like the street vendor selling nothing in the Roman Empire, and the clever wordplay of a name like Swiftus Lazarus (Ron Carey), a takeoff on notable celebrity talent agent Swifty Lazar. The idea behind the movie was a pretty good one, and it was a hoot catching so many of Brooks's regulars like Harvey Korman, Madeline Kahn and Dom DeLuise, along with the cameos of lesser known comedians like Jan Murray, Jackie Mason and Jack Carter. There's even a quick glimpse of Playboy's Hugh Hefner with a bevy of beautiful girls at his service. But it's not enough to overcome a sense of frustration with a movie that could have been so much better without the puerile behavior. It's probably a relief there was no Part Two.",History of the World - Part I
4,gavin6942,The Best of Brooks?,7,12 May 2011,"From the dawn of man to the distant future, mankind's evolution (or lack thereof) is traced.I think this may possibly be Mel Brooks' best film. The humor is non-stop, and should be great for everyone. He revives the ""walk this way"" gag yet again, and even throws in some more subtle references. I really, really loved the vulgar Oedipus joke.I could question the historical accuracy, such as the cave paintings being in America rather than Europe, but since a dinosaur appears soon after, I figure they really did not care very much about this.Brooks has his cast of regulars ready here (Dom DeLuise, Cloris Leachman, Madeline Kahn), and also Gregory Hines (in his screen debut), a welcome addition.",History of the World - Part I
5,lee_eisenberg,And to think that some people consider history boring!,10,15 April 2006,"Since ""History of the World: Part I"" is from Mel Brooks, we all know what that means! Specifically, there's the Fifteen Commandments, the waiter at the Last Supper, a musical Spanish Inquisition, and a very un-French Revolution. You gotta wonder how Mel Brooks comes up with these things. I think that my favorite part was the Inquisition, and the joke on Torquemada's name. And of course, the suggestions for the sequel were also great; the sort of things that only Mel Brooks could do. Classic, hilarious, and everything such.Anyway, Brooks plays several different people throughout the movie. Also starring are Dom DeLuise, Madeline Kahn, Harvey Korman, Cloris Leachman, Gregory Hines, Sid Caesar and John Hurt. Orson Welles narrates. You read that right: Orson Welles narrates a Mel Brooks movie.",History of the World - Part I
6,rmax304823,"Often funny, sometimes very funny, slapdash comedy.",7,18 May 2007,"Mel Brooks' blackout sketches, mostly involving cave men, ancient Rome, the Inquisition, and the French Revolution, with a lot of other stuff thrown in. The various shreds are so impulsively but personally patched together that one wonders how he could have gotten such a cast, mostly familiar old timers.The style of the humor isn't what anyone would call fresh. A shot of a street in ancient Rome has a black guy walking along with a boombox against his ear. Ha ha. Facing the guillotine, Brooks is asked if he has any last requests. ""Yes -- NOVACAINE!"" ""It hasn't been invented yet."" ""I'll wait!"" And Brooks from time to time glances at the camera and makes comments on the shenanigans.A lot of the humor is Jewish. During a parody of Esther Williams' movies we not only see seven girls in bathing suits (and caps) slowly emerge from the pool wearing sparklers on their heads, but as they go up and up we see that they're standing on a menorah. A drowning man shouts and the underwater bubble of his breath rises to the surface and pops and it says, ""Oy, gewalt!"" Maybe I should quit because otherwise I'll give away all the gags and some of them depend on the principle of fundamental surprise. Many of them also depend on vulgarity, in more than one language. It's about as politically correct as you can get. I don't know that even in a good-natured comedy that skewers politicians, racism, Judaism, Hollywood, and Holy Mother Church you could get away with calling someone a ""fag"" today. Or how about this. Gregory Hines' intact heterosexuality is revealed and someone shouts, ""The jig is up!"" ""And gone,"" exclaims Hines, diving out the window.For me the scene that works best is the one in which Brooks is Louis XVI, shooting down peasants as they are flung through the air like clay pigeons. He's in a ridiculous ""King"" costume and wears a villainous black mustache and a beauty spot. Strolling through the garden, he gooses Marie Antoinette, winks at the camera and says, ""It's good to be da king."" And when he's forcing a beautiful blond virgin to meet him later that night, in order to save her imprisoned father, he adopts this smug, conspiratorial tone as he tells her, ""You do it. You KNOW you do it. You WANNA do it. We all do it."" And he smiles wickedly at us and reminds us again that, ""It's good to be da king."" I said this was a good-natured comedy and what I mean is that it doesn't depend in any way on anger. There isn't even an undertone of nastiness. We see a sketch from what we used to call ""coming attractions"" -- ""Hitler on Ice"" -- and Hitler performs gracefully. The humor lies in the absurdity of the concept. Any value judgments about the subject are taken for granted.Some of it looks quite a bit like Woody Allen, but it may be a case of independent invention. What it reminds me of at times are the ""Road"" films of Bing Crosby and Bob Hope. Now THAT'S good-natured comedy, although Brooks idea of fun is of course more urban, if not more urbane.The bloated pompous baritone of Orson Welles introduces each new segment with portentous comments -- ""The first weapon was the spear."" Welles, like Brooks, is obviously kidding around too. Everybody is kidding around and the result is quite a lot of fun, despite the occasional wince.",History of the World - Part I
7,ma-cortes,"Silly jokes, slapstick and sight gags galore",5,16 June 2008,"The film concerns about history of the world in various parts, from the dawn of human being until the distant future in French Revolution and narrated by Orson Welles. The first part during the Stone age with a sympathetic cavemen(Sid Caesar, Ron Carey) inventing the music. The second about Roman Empire with a filthy emperor Nero(Don DeLuise) with flatulence,a lecherous empress(Madeleine Khan) a slave(Gregory Hines) and of course, Mel Brooks. The following , the Spanish Inquisition , again with Mel Brooks as Torquemada making a spectacular dances, including a beautiful swimmers. The third part about French Revolution with a lascivious Luis XVI(Brooks),a conspirator count of Monet(recently deceased Harvey Korman) and a gorgeous Mademoiselle Rimbaud(Pamela Stephenson).Mel Brook's direction keeps things moving with laughs, he directed this sometimes hilarious, but mostly crude and bad taste spoof of history with ridiculous episodes, as how to test eunuchs or the lasciviousness of Luis XVI's court. The jokes come with machine-gun rapidly , though don't always work, there are so many of them that this comedy ends up with enoughs laughs for quite entertaining. It's a stupid movie but also funny and remains like a laugh-filled amusement. The movie hasn't the thematic unity of 'The producers, Blazing saddles and Young Frankestein', the Mel Brooks's best . The stars race around like maniacs and appear several famous uncredited, actors and directors, such as Hugh Hefner as Roman entrepreneur, Paul Mazursky as roman officer, Barry Levinson as column salesman, Art Metrano as Leonardo and John Hurt as Jesus in a bemusing sketch about the 'Last supper', among others. The film is classified 'PG', parents guide, as displays objectionable material, for occasional adult content, crude language and profanity. If it weren't in such bad taste and dirty humor , it would be perfect for the children.",History of the World - Part I
8,moonspinner55,"Childish, vulgar, outlandish--typical Mel Brooks",3,7 May 2006,"Mel Brooks' colorfully offensive spoof of history was lambasted by the critics upon its release, but time has been kind to it (and legions of fans now defend it). Large cast of game players from Madeline Kahn to Cloris Leachman, Sid Caesar to Brooks himself, work hard at making this gag-filled romp a rollicking spectacle, but Brooks' heavy-hand as a filmmaker causes an oppressiveness that is tough to shake off. The Prehistoric opener, the French Revolution and the Spanish Inquisition are all brightly accomplished, but the cheap-looking Roman Empire section is hammy and dull, practically stopping the movie in its tracks. As with many of Brooks' films (particularly from this period), ninety-percent of the jokes are groaners and there's far too much shouting amongst the players (as if the world had gone deaf). Some big laughs do emerge from the morass, and it is admittedly one of Brooks' more ambitious efforts. *1/2 from ****",History of the World - Part I
9,Quinoa1984,It's good to be the king,10,6 July 2000,"That's what Mel Brooks must be saying all the time, especially after this film.  This is one of his funniest films that looks at history instead of parodying other films.  Great fun, as we look at The Stone Age, The Ten Commandments (thats probably the funniest part), The Roman Empire, The Spanish Inquisition (that song is hilarious) and the French Revolution (not to mention the look at History of the World part 2 featuring Hitler on Ice, A Viking Funeral and Jews in Space).  Hilarious all around, but only if you like this type of humor.  A",History of the World - Part I
10,tavm,"History of the World, Part I is Mel Brooks at his most irreverent",8,17 September 2013,"After 30 years, I finally got to see the entirety of Mel Brooks' History of the World, Part I and I gotta say, I found most of it funny though I can understand why many critics were offended by much of it. There are quite a few scatological jokes from Dom DeLuise burping and farting in the Roman sequence to Harvey Korman's peeing in the French Revolution segment. And then there's Mel Brooks, who not only produced and directed this, but also single-handedly wrote it and stars in most of the sketches. Seeing him doing the Spanish Inquisition as a Busby Berkeley-Esther Williams number was perhaps the most irreverent thing he ever did especially when the nuns doff their uniforms to reveal their one-piece swimsuits and bathing caps! Gregory Hines made his film debut here and is a hoot whether doing his dance steps in order to keep him from trouble or making a giant joint to distract the Roman guards! Madeline Kahn and Cloris Leachman also contribute their funny selves to good effect and then there's longtime Brooks associate Sid Ceasar playing a cave man in the Stone Age segment also being his usual funny self. Really, all I'll say now is if you are a die-hard Brooks fan, I highly recommend History of the World, Part I.",History of the World - Part I
11,edwagreen,History/World Part 1- History Was Never Worse than this *,1,26 May 2007,"You would think that after Mel Brooks made ""The Producers"" with its offensive ""Springtime for Hitler,"" that he would have had enough. Unfortunately, not so. He continues his nonsense with this 1981 offensive film.I didn't enjoy his song of The Inquisition. This was utterly stupid and insulting to all people. Equally offensive is Gregory Hines acting Jewish to avoid persecution as a Christian.The writing is absolutely inane. We here lines such as sic transit Gloria and the response to that is: ""I didn't know that Gloria was sick.""The film tries to poke fun of the various aspects of history.Madeleine Kahn puts on her Brooklyn accent in force to play a French Queen. Cloris Leachman is totally ridiculous as Mme. De Farge. Imagine the writing- De Farge- Serving the Scum of Paris for Over 20 Years. Blanche Yurka must be turning over in her grave.Brooks should put his history anthologies to rest. They're becoming overly obnoxious.",History of the World - Part I
12,Hey_Sweden,"The Inquisition, what a show!",6,17 December 2016,"Writer, producer & director Mel Brooks takes the opportunity to poke fun at various points in world history. Enough of his verbal and visual jokes are funny to make this pleasant - if never truly hysterical - viewing. Among the eras that he spoofs are The Stone Age, Biblical times, The Roman Empire, The Spanish Inquisition, and The French Revolution. Mel himself gets to play multiple roles, and gives some zany parts to a variety of top performers, some of them regulars in his filmography.Unfortunately, the momentum isn't always that great. The Roman Empire sequence really does go on too long. The movie isn't always terribly amusing, but when it does hit, it works well. The parody of The Spanish Inquisition is the brightest portion because it's portrayed as a splashy production number, complete with dancing monks and swimming nuns. It's just too funny to hear these characters sing about human depravity.And therein lies a critical factor with this entry in the Brooks resume. He's not afraid to possibly offend viewers, just as he was with his classic Western spoof ""Blazing Saddles"" of seven years previous. Some people might be surprised with the foul language employed, while others will be delighted. Brooks is clever at times with his anachronisms, and even has characters from different segments interacting with each other.The sequence with the primitive men and women also works pretty well. (""History of the World: Part I"" actually came out around the same time as another skewering of prehistoric times, ""Caveman"" with Ringo Starr.) One moment that this viewer truly did love was the emergence of the ""first artist"", which leads to the emergence of the ""first critic"".Rather than list all of the familiar faces utilized by Brooks, this viewer thinks it best to just let others discover them for themselves. He will say, however, that among the performers, Sid Caesar (as a caveman) and Gregory Hines (as a slave) come off the best. (Hines, in his film debut, replaced Richard Pryor.) The cameo by the ""entrepreneur"" during The Roman Empire segment was unexpected and quite the hoot. Orson Welles can sometimes be heard as a narrator.As a final joke, a sequel (including a trip to space) is advertised before the closing credits.Six out of 10.",History of the World - Part I
13,Bunuel1976,"History Of The World Part I (Mel Brooks, 1981) **1/2",6,4 August 2007,"I had watched this as a kid, a popular but not highly-regarded Brooks effort. It is wildly uneven but, also, undeniably funny at times (even if most of the gags are, unsurprisingly, of the vulgar kind).Brooks managed to rope in Orson Welles to provide indifferent narration over his lampoon of various historical eras (the film's one-liners, too, read better than they play). Still, ""The Stone Age"" (featuring Sid Caesar) offers a nice parody of the ""Dawn Of Man"" sequence from Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (1968)  while the brief but hilarious ""The Old Testament"" sees Brooks himself as Moses accidentally lose a third of God's original 15 Commandments! ""The Roman Empire""  the longest segment  features Brooks veterans Dom De Luise and Madeleine Kahn, the film's single best joke (the Senators' spontaneous reply, in unison, to a fellow members' concern over the plight of the city's poor), plus wonderful conclusion involving John Hurt as Jesus Christ. ""The Spanish Inquistion"" is, again, brief but surely one of the film's highlights with its tastelessly inspired depiction of this infamous period as a Busby Berkeley-ish production number (though Brooks' typical Jewish jokes seem baffling in this context). Just as Monty Python had done the definitive parody of the Roman Empire with LIFE OF BRIAN (1979), ""The French Revolution"" follows on from the ""Carry On"" gang's DON'T LOSE YOUR HEAD (1966). The results are just as middling (involving the inevitable impersonation of the King by a commoner)  but highlighting two established presences in Brooks' films, Harvey Korman and Cloris Leachman. Easily the funniest bit from this segment is the King's outrageous shooting practice.Still, at the end of the day, Brooks can't avoid repeating himself: the ""Walk This Way"" gag from YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN (1974) turns up here as well; Brooks' lecherous French king is virtually a copy of his Governor characterization in the Western spoof BLAZING SADDLES (1974); and the surreal nick-of-time escape at the very end, which also derives from the latter film.",History of the World - Part I
14,lastliberal,Happy birthday to the head rabbit,8,9 April 2007,"Who would have guessed that 81-year-old Hugh Hefner actually acted in a movie that didn't have Playboy in the title? I think it is also appropriate that Hef has a birthday right after Easter. But he was in this Mel Brooks classic.If you like Young Frankenstein or the The Producers, then you will absolutely love this movie. It is a rollicking roller coaster ride of sight gags, double entendres, laughs and zany fun that characterizes Mel Brooks. It includes the usual cast of characters in addition to Hef: Harvey Korman, Rudy De Luca, Madeline Kahn, and Dom DeLuise, and, of course, Brooks.It is a spoof of the French Revolution, the Inquisition, the Last Supper, the Roman Empire and more.",History of the World - Part I
15,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,You flunked flanking?!?,7,7 January 2011,"This is a series of sketches(and they're frankly quite hit and miss), detailing(well, spoofing) historical events(I have a feeling the Moses bit is what actually happened if The Old Testament wasn't a collection of poorly written, hateful fiction), starting at the dawn of man and ending with The French Revolution. Other than the longest portion, set in ancient Rome, there is no continuous plot, really. It's a nice satire, with plenty to laugh at, with silly stuff, cleverness, plays on words, smut, some slapstick, crude material, weirdness. We do get the, for the period mandatory, annoying ""sassy black dude""(on the plus side, it makes fun of Christianity). This is quite sexually suggestive, and features some rather nice cleavage. It's *very* Jewish and Brooksian. There are a few ill-shot and/or –edited bits, though on the whole, it is put together well(in spite of the occasional obvious matte painting). The central musical number(about the Inquisition!) isn't half bad. There is a bunch of mild violence and disturbing content, and a moderate amount of strong language. I recommend this to any fan of Mel. 7/10",History of the World - Part I
16,Mr-Fusion,Big Hollywood comedy done in by stale jokes,4,12 February 2015,"""History of the World: Part I"" is a shocking example of a 90-minute series of gags that land with a dull thud. This is coming from a Mel Brooks fan, which is the reason for the shock. Also, the disappointment. It started out with promise (Brooks and the fift- . . . ten commandments, Bea Arthur in the unemployment office but then the Ancient Rome segment happens and things grind to a halt. And then never pick back up, even after we get out of Rome. It's not every day you see the comedic talents of Dom Deluise squandered (same thing happened with ""Smokey and the Bandit II"").This was bad.",History of the World - Part I
17,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Not my favorite Mel Brooks film, but still a classic",9,6 December 2004,"I think in some way you can just get a few laughs from the film. Sometimes you see jokes that get overused. Especially from Mel Brooks. While I admit that the guy is a genius, he can over do it with the jokes. But if you are a history nut, you'll find a lot of good humor in here. I think the reason why it has a rating lower than 7.0 is because most people don't get it. Besides the over used jokes, you get a few decent laughs out of this. I would recommend it for Mel Brooks fans. Otherwise, I'm not sure if anyone else would really enjoy it. At least by today's comedy level, it's a bit dull for others. Just try to have an open mind with it. You never know what you may find.9/10",History of the World - Part I
18,Rainey-Dawn,History at it's Funniest,8,4 July 2014,"Another great film from the humorous world views of Mel Brooks. This film is a skit comedy. Skits that give us funny and twisted snapshots of world history that most of us are familiar with.With Brooks' film, you can see the comical side of ""well history may have happened this way"". Who knows; I'm sure the people in our history books may have had some funny accidents like falling off their chair (a la America's Funniest Home Videos) or some other comical moment in their life. Looking at it like this gives Brooks' film a bit more humor and maybe a bit more realistic view of the famous people from history that is painted having no humorous follies. Remember they were only humans after all so ""happy accidents"" and funny moments could have really occurred to them.8.5/10",History of the World - Part I

20,sddavis63,Just Not That Funny,2,26 January 2003,"I had high hopes when I picked up this movie, seeing so many legends of comedy starring in it. Unfortunately, the thing about legends is that they often stick around for too long. With the possible exceptions of Gregory Hines and Madeline Kahn (who still weren't all that funny) we have a classic example of that. For me, this movie just didn't work. I didn't think it was very funny, and the ridiculousness of it wore thin after a while for the simple reason that it was unfunny ridiculousness, if there is such a thing.Oh, there were a couple of cute moments that caused me to smile. Moses (Mel Brooks) dropping Commandments 11-15 comes to mind. But overall this struck me as a bunch of aging comedians who didn't really have it any more but couldn't admit it.2/10",History of the World - Part I
21,theowinthrop,"I'm Still Awaiting Part II and ""Hitler on Ice""",8,9 July 2006,"Mel Brooks did not invent the comedy spoof movie, but his best work (""Blazing Saddles"", ""Young Frankenstein"", ""Dracula, Dead And Loving It"", and ""High Anxiety"") certainly make the most of it - even if some of it gets rather too dirty (literally dirty - ""caca"" dirty). ""History Of The World"" is a funny film, but it is not one of his best films. It looks like it was based on bits and pieces of ideas that could have been built up into separate movies: a film about the stone age, a film about the Roman Empire, a film about the French Revolution. I am sure that Brooks was inventive enough to have created three film spoofs, but for some reason he decided to just concentrate on pasting these mini-spoofs together.It has wonderful moments in it - some are thrown away. The four desperate refugees from the Roman Empire, followed by centurions, pray for a miracle. Suddenly they see an old man - Brooks dressed like Moses (from an earlier sequence in the film). A river is parted like the Red Sea with ""Moses"" arms in the air. The refugees flee thanking God and Moses. In a moment we see there is a robber in back of ""Moses"" holding him up (hence his arms in the air), and when the robber leaves the old man starts cursing him.Similar stuff is throughout the film (typical of Brooks' inventiveness). After fleeing Rome, Brooks has reached Palestine and is the waiter serving the ""Last Supper"". Besides having a problem when he keeps saying ""JEEZUS"" causing John Hurt (who is Christ) to ask, ""Yes?"", there is the problem of the painting being done by Da Vinci (Art Metrano), and how Brooks manages to get into the background of the masterpiece - holding his tray like a halo behind Hurt).Brooks uses a number of his regulars in the film: Madeline Kahn as the Empress Nympho, Dom DeLuis as the Emperor (one could call him ""piggy"" after one particular comment about his eating habits), Harvey Korman as the foppish Count du Monet, Sid Caesar as a caveman who is full of awe. He was also lucky to have Gregory Hines, usually a dancer but here a strikingly breezy comic, and Orson Welles doing the narration properly (note his voice's confusion at the start when describing the first heterosexual marriage, followed by the first homosexual one).The disjointed style is a minor problem in enjoying the film. Judging from the final scenes from the sequel, Brooks could have done a Viking movie, a skating film about Nazism, and a space musical about the Jews. Alas, only those scenes were ever shot. A second part might not have been a great film either, but it would have been quite as amusing.",History of the World - Part I
22,Lejink,Mel's stormy...,6,6 August 2007,"Good not great Brooks... That means you get slightly more kitsch, vulgarity and old gags to the dollar than you can take but for every old-as-Methuselah gag (he even gets the old ""Walk this way"" staple in there), there are enough compensatory puns and sight gags present, with more than a few in-jokes at the expense of past Hollywood historical blockbusters along the way. Me, I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a line like ""Judea Judea Judea"" delivered in knowing Cary Grant style and there are plenty more where that came from. The extended scenes in Ancient Rome and Revolutionary France work best (and are cinematographically well rendered too, something people often overlook with Brooks) as his stereotypically skewered band of characters have fun with more double-entendres than even Sid James would cackle at. Of the cameos, Pamela Stephenson (Mrs Billy Connolly now) thrusts her chest about wo - manfully and Gregory Hines does something similar with an equally libidinous part of his anatomy. I enjoyed the film, a funny romp and one senses the players did so too.",History of the World - Part I
23,ElMaruecan82,Brooks squeezing the comedic juice of history... at the risk of leaving a few acid gags...,7,30 January 2021,"The film opens majestically à la ""2001"" with a vision of our gesticulating monkeys.When the title 'our forefathers' appeared, I laughed at both the punchline and the friendly jab to Stanley Kubrick
No offense to ""2001"" fans but who doesn't skip the monkey parts?Mel Brooks however can see the comedic subtext of the prehistoric world and with Sid Caesar as the star of the chapter, he provides a nice little series of sketches retelling the invention of fire, the first artist, the first critic ... some jokes inspired smiles, the first marriage bit was mildly funny when Tex Avery used it in ""The First Bad Man"", but that's Mel Brooks you know, he throws you one gag after another and the one that doesn't work is only a little low spot before a higher bump.Now the film opened with a big joke, Mel Brooks wanted to make a big film, one so big that it would deal about the History of the World, and it would be a two-parter... I reckon his merit to have created the only film whose title is a joke itself. But I wish the film could hold up to that premise, ""History of the World Part I"" isn't exactly the comedic odyssey Orson Welles' voice-over prepares us to, in fact it's one epic cinematic muddle out of which some genuinely hilarious moments emerge and keep the joke-o-meter on a good track, which allows Mel Brooks to arrive safely at 'The End' without compromising his reputation as one of the most inventive and outrageous comics of his generation.The problem is that the most inspired moments can be compacted in a half-hour format. The Roman part drags on for too long and Gregory Hines, as Josephus, does his best to prove how valuable he was but he's not given good material and can only indulge to the kind of token black man's shtick that gets quickly annoying. Sure Brooks never hid his penchant for distastefulness with his infamous 'rising below vulgarity' limit but there's a limit to which a gimmick can be used. Maybe the weakness of the Roman part is that the main characters Comicus (Brooks) and Josephus are entertainers and making laugh is part of their job; they're funny by status, not through their reactions to what befalls on them.Take a film like ""Life of Brian"", the comedy works because everyone plays the part seriously and thus become unintentionally funny; even Brooks' previous films had funny situations happening to straight persons, but when the person is ""funny"" by plot requirement, it doesn't work. This is why Madeline Kahn as the Impress IS funny and grabs some of the rare laughs from the first part and this is why I laughed more at Dom DeLuise when he didn't utter a word (belches and farts don't count) than Brooks when he was playing his stand-up comic. I gather he didn't intend Comicus to be a top comedian but why would anyone waste five minutes with tiresome jokes to make a point when you can have one minute of sheer nonsense to make us laugh.The Roman part left me with a frustrating impression that Brooks had the Emperor, the Eunuch and Chase scene in mind and asked the best of his inspiration to connect them all, which results in some scenes of relative emptiness: the trio tries to escape the Romans and sometimes, nothing much happens, during the Vestal sequence, they're all pretty to look at but there's no pay-off to that part, take the Anthrax Castle sequence in ""Holy Grail"" and you'll see the difference. That said, the Roman part ends with one terrific joke involving a cameo from Moses (his breaking-the-tablet bit was so good it's almost the film's signature) and a little nod to the last supper with Da Vinci making an unexpected cameo. I think it serves my point that Comicus was the funniest when he didn't even try.After the 'Last Supper' gag, the film takes a new level of energy reaching its culminating point with the infamous 'Inquisition' song, a homage to Hollywood corny musicals with the horrific Torquemada pulling a Fred Astaire. That was the part to remind us that the creator of ""Springtime for Hitler"" and re-creator of ""Puttin' on the Ritz"" still had it. The song is catchy, the nun part irreverent and graciously inventive, and here you have less than ten minutes more worthy of your attention than the previous part. And after the musical interlude, we get to the last chapter: ""The French Revolution"".The beginning struck me as one of these erotic dreams where you can fulfill any fantasy, ""It's good to be the king"" works so much a line it was almost self-referential, Brooks is the king of his own film and can do whatever he wants, for worse; the urination part (one joke was enough) or the chess part and for better: the peasant trapshooting and the poor Parisian sequences with Dickensian undertones. The part concludes with the kind of chaotic Deus Ex Machina that worked interestingly better than in ""Blazing Saddles"" (but that's my opinion) and it was fun having the main characters all joining at the end before the finale and the previews announcing a sequel that would never happen.For all its flaws, the film is an interesting on an educational level for it picks the most pivotal times of history: the dawn of humanity, the Biblical Law, Antiquity, Medieval Ages that ended with the Inquisition and Modern times that ended with the French Revolution, and Brooks manages to squeeze the comedic juice from each pivotal period... though some gags turn rapidly acid. He still had his ""Spaceballs"" coming and the film worked better with a consistent plot, a linear narrative and character who didn't try to be funny but let the fun come to them.I wouldn't call the film end-of-era for Brooks but obviously his best work was already history.",History of the World - Part I
24,ericstevenson,There's no Part II,7,27 July 2018,"The title of this movie is actually a joke about Sir Walter Raleigh. He wrote a book called ""The Historie Of The World"" that never had a second part. It's because he was kinda executed. Anyway, I liked this from the beginning with the caveman. It features cavemen learning how to make music by dropping stuff on their foot. I actually myself thought of a joke like that. The Roman Empire segment is half of the film and that really is a weak point. I wanted to see it more evenly distributed. It's not as good as ""Young Frankenstein"", ""Blazing Saddles"" (my favorite) or ""Spaceballs"" but is still enjoyable. I laughed when they mentioned the Romans were crawling around and they literally were! I just love Mel Brooks' voice.

After watching this, I found it interesting the way he created from taking a mick out of the stone age era to the French revolution years. When he did the Roman year, I thought himself and the characters he made friends with, it was all going to be about them. However it's like next chapter as we go along with the story. I found it very amusing but very confused at the same time. Who are a meant to be concentrating on again?It's very good I have to say, it really reflects the timelines of different eras, the funny way.

27,inkblot11,"In the history of Brooks' films, my fav is still Spaceballs but this one is funny and breezy",7,13 April 2009,"Starting with the Stone Age and ending with the French Revolution, this film has some very amusing vignettes. Caveman (Sid Caesar) learns about fire and vaudeville, when one of his fellow cavers gets hauled off a stage by a dinosaur. Next up is Moses (Mel Brooks himself) who is bringing down the ""15 Commandments"" but ends up dropping and pulverizing the tablet with five of the biggies on it. Much time is spent telling the ""true"" story of Ancient Rome, where Nero (Dom DeLuise) is still crazy as a loon but likes stand-up routines and where his wife, Nympho (Madeleine Kahn) can make decision or two behind his back. Slave Josephus (Gregory Hinds) dodges a few swords but ends up on the road to freedom, where he and others find a nice patch of weed and decide that the collapse of the empire is nothing serious. And, so it goes. Brooks has created a nice little humorous movie, sending up some of the more heinous periods of world history (The Inquistion, Madame LeFarge (Cloris Leachman) and creating mirth. The cast is the greatest asset, for the members are truly legends who could make a stone giggle. The sets, costumes, and production values are also quite wonderful and the script and direction are zesty and humorous. While my personal favorite of Brooks' movies remains Spaceballs (my hair, they shot my hair!), this one will do more than nicely when comedic relief is greatly needed. It might even send viewers to the library or the internet to learn the historical facts about the real events behind the laughs. In any case, make it part of your personal history to record a viewing of this funny little flick.",History of the World - Part I
28,redryan64,"What Else can we say about Mel Brooks' HISTORY OF THE WORLD, PART 1, except ""There was never a ""PART 2"".",3,31 December 2007,"HISTORY OF THE WORLD PART I.It was from the fertile fields and valleys of the earliest days of Network Television that gave us the bundle of madcap comedian on the hoof that is Mel Brooks. And if we were to measure comic ability and creative genius, his would certainly be over flowing its cup.And it was at the Sid Ceasar-Imogene Coca weekly Comedy Review YOUR SHOW OF SHOWS on the NBC Television Network that he honed and perfected his wit and penchant for the offbeat and the unlikely targets for our laughter. Of course, he wasn't alone as a master funny guy in this conclave of zany inventiveness. His Classmates included: His best friend, Carl Reiner, Woody Allen, Howard Morris and Neil Simon. Now that's not too shabby of a crowd to be hangin' out with, no? His interests were broader, though and soon he was performing in front of audience and camera with such now famous set pieces as his collaboration with Carl Reiner as THE 2,000 YEAR OLD MAN and such similar type works. (If ""similar type works"" is the correct term!) Mel's snowball had started rolling down the old Hillside, and there'd be no stopping it; as it gathered an ever increasing critical mass, that would explode on the Hollywood Scene making the man one guy who could write his own ticket. He certainly did do that thing and soon we were treated to titles, such as THE PRODUCERS (Crossbow Prod. / United Artists, 1968), which of course is his own story, screenplay and Direction. He followed that up with THE 12 CHAIRS (Crossbow / United Artists, 1970), which kept the Mel Brooks Bandwagon cruising along.Then in seeming rapid succession, we were treated to BLAZING SADDLES! (Crossbow Prod. / Warner Brothers, 1974.), YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN (Crossbow Prod. / 20th Century-Fox, 1974), SILENT MOVIE (Crossbow Prod. / 20th Century-Fox, 1976) and his spoof send-up of Mr. Hitchcock's work in HIGH ANXIETY (Crossbow / 20thCentury-Fox, 1976). Well, even DiMaggio's streak ended and so did Mel's with this HISTORY OF THE WORLD, PART I. Perhaps it was the Good Lord's way of reminding Mel and us, his loyal followers, that he, too, is only human after all.OUR STORYis really a phrase that doesn't fit here; as we have a whole bunch of very well disconnected and episodic sketches, each one only bound together to the others by their being a ""part of History"".* From Stone Age Caveman to the dawning of Modern Day, Mel took us there with some very amusing moments; but not nearly enough of them. Some of his gags were just plain D.O.A.; others bordered on the sophomoric and others still were titillating little bits of non-funny business, bordering on being Blue Humor. Mel even violated one of the cardinal rules of making comedies (or farce). He went and ended the final forgettable sketch with an unashamed reference to occurrences in a previous, non related sketch; then topped that off with a speech of his own that went something like: ""Yes, that's the wonderful thing about Movies!"", or some such.We all are well aware of the recent success of the Musical adaptation of THE PRODUCERS, from movie screen to Broadway Stage. This was further bumped up the evolutionary track to a new, this time musical film adapted from the stage play that was adapted from the original 1968 movie. We know that everyone has felt happy for Mel and congratulated him, wishfully anyhow.Tonight we have seen for the first time an advertisement for a Broadway Musical treatment of the Gene Wilder-Mel Brooks collaboration, YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN. We wish Gene and Mel nothing but ""Good Luck"" in this endeavour, feeling certain that it surely will be as successful as THE PRODUCERS was.And we know that we can say for sure that there'll be no HISTORY OF THE WORLD, PART I following in its path on the Great White Way.NOTE: * We are put in mind of the Irwin Allen/Warner Brothers Big Cast,Big Bust of a misfired dud, the overly ambitious THE STORY OF MANKIND (1957), which was an equally ill-conceived and overly ambitious book by one Henrik Van Loon.",History of the World - Part I
29,Petey-10,Mel Brooks' history lesson,8,8 January 2010,"This Mel Brooks comedy takes us into different time periods.First we see the Dawn of Man, then we see the history of the Old Testament and some stand-up philosophy of the Roman Empire, singing and dancing of the Spanish Inquisition and finally the French Revolution with the nutty king.History of the World: Part I is from 1981.Where is part II, Mr. Brooks?! I was really waiting to see Hitler on ice.Orson Welles does the narrating.Sid Caesar is hilarious as the caveman.He doesn't have too many lines, but it's amazing what he can do just by grunting.Dom DeLuise, the great comedy talent who we sadly lost last year at 76, does brilliant job playing Emperor Caesar.Harvey Korman, who we lost the year before, does great job playing Count de Monet.The late great Madeline Kahn is Empress Nympho and the late great Gregory Hines plays Josephus.Ron Carey portrays Swiftus Lazarus.Pamela Stephenson plays Mademoiselle Rimbaud.Spike Milligan is Monsieur Rimbaud.Shecky Greene is Marcus Vindictus.Bea Arthur (1922-2009) plays Woman in Unemployment Booth.Mary-Margaret Humes is Vestal Virgin named Miriam.Hugh Hefner is seen as Roman outside Temple of Eros.Paul Mazursky is Roman Officer.Barry Levinson is Column Salesman.Jackie Mason is Jew #1.Phil Leeds is Chief Monk.John Hurt plays Jesus Christ himself.Carl Reiner is the voice of God himself.Mel Brooks himself hasn't settled for one role only.He plays the parts of Moses, Comicus, Tomas de Torquemada, Louis XVI of France and Jacques le Garcon de Pisse.He does exquisite job as all of those.This isn't the best Mel Brooks has come up with.But this is entertaining that makes you laugh quite a few times.Did you know that God originally gave Moses 15 Commandments, but then he dropped one of the tablets and it became 10 Commandments? That's what we learn in this movie in a hilarious way.In the Last Supper scene Comicus keeps interrupting Jesus repeatedly, and Leonardo da Vinci (?) comes to paint the group's portrait.The jokes performed at the Caesar's Place of the stand-up philosopher are quite funny.Maybe he goes a little over the line joking about Caesar's obesity and the corruption, and he finds himself fighting to the death in a gladiatorial manner with Josephus.The pissboy becoming the king...Hilarious.""It's good to be the king"".You don't have to pay too much attention during this history lesson.But you are allowed to laugh, though.",History of the World - Part I
30,jzappa,Laughing Out Loud,9,20 October 2010,"Comic perspective is usually determined in the opening moments of a funny movie, establishing the rules of the new world and hooking the audience. Well, History of the World Part I begins with cavemen waking up and humping air for what feels like a solid 2 minutes. This is his Dawn of Man segment, a vague parody of Kubrick's 2001, before he moves on to The Stone Age during which the first art critic is sent up, and then mocks Moses in an Old Testament sketch, which is essentially a single joke that we fade into and out of that quickly. Where Brooks really goes to town is during The Roman Empire. He stars as a ""stand-up philosopher"" who, along with a black slave played by Gregory Hines and a defiant vestal virgin, brings pandemonium to the court of the extraordinarily hilarious Emperor Nero, in one of Dom DeLuise's most memorable performances, and Madeleine Kahn, his nymphomaniac empress.We're actually surprised when the movie moves on, because it seems to have decided to develop some semblance of a story there, unlike its preceding episodes. But it does, and Brooks again takes center stage as Torquemada, who celebrates his ecstatic pleasure in torturing Jews who reject Christianity in a Busby Berkeley tableau abounding with melody, singing, and a water ballet. Oh, and a funny little aside elucidates some unanswered questions about how Leonardo Da Vinci painted the Last Supper. Ultimately, Harvey Korman steals the spotlight from Brooks, as per usual, in an absurd caricature of The French Revolution. Korman plays foppish nobleman Count De Monet, who turns up with a cunning plot to save King Louis XVI from death at the hands of the mob by switching the King's lowly doppelganger on the crucial occasion.This is an incoherent, disorderly, sometimes awkward romp by one of the most talented comic filmmakers, who never seems to have a clear idea of the underlying principle of his seventh film escapade, so there's no assertive narrative incentive to bear it along. His historical context doesn't have any method or perspective. It's basically just an assembly line for whatever jokes he can sling on it. What is this off-the-wall grab bag? Is it a lampoon of old Biblical, Roman and French historical epics? From time to time. Is it a never-to-be-repeated, comedy vaudeville seizure? Now and then. Is it a send-up trained at haughty foils? Every so often. But generally it's in essence simply valuable sets standing there expecting Brooks to do something comical before them.Synchronously with Woody Allen, Brooks has helped sustain the comedy genre in contemporary films. As Allen has turned increasingly sophisticated and contemplative, Brooks has gotten increasingly campy and preposterous, the politically incorrect auteur and effortless ham actor's rudimentary oomph let loose flat out with this outrageous 1981 package picture, in which---rather than taking razor-sharp bites out of status quo mythologies and nostalgic legends as he did with his crowning achievements Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein---he indulges in our incessant need for mocking the sort of unconsciously class-based theories of manners and good form that inadvertently made burlesque all the rage in its puritan heyday. As in all movies by the ambitious Brooks, there are dull patches where the farce and the gags just don't work. But hit-or-miss is his style, so when he does hit, he hits the bullseye. Or at least somewhere in the red or yellow.",History of the World - Part I

Unfortunately, the many late 1970's pop-culture references throughout the dialog is what dates this work. Otherwise, it would still be fresh, today.Led by Mel Brooks's polished stylized direction, this work is not only hilarious, but is clever in its irony.

Mel Brooks knows his history and he adds a lot of odd references that a history buff will easily pick out. Mel Brooks also stars in this film as Comicus, Moses, King Louis XVI, Torquemada and a Royal employee. Dom De Luise co-stars as Emperor Nero, Madeline Khan as Empress Nympho, Gregory Hines as Josephus (a part clearly written for Richard Pryor who bowed out early in pre-production due to personal demons), Harvey Korman as Count De Money are some of Mel Brooks regulars who appear in this film. Watch out for a lot of stand-up comics who have cameo roles in this film.The title (a funny gag for history buffs as well) references the only volume of ""The History of the World"" that Sir Walter Raleigh wrote before he lost his head (figuratively and literally).

The other segments are also good, just not as inspired.The whole film is packed with raunchy humor, sight gags, and surreal touches (this film probably has more fourth-wall breaking than Blazing Saddles (1974)).

35,slokes,Mel's Historic Flop,4,14 January 2008,"When ""History Of The World Part 1"" came out in 1981, it had been four years since Mel Brooks' last screen comedy, and given his track record at the time and the long wait, ""History"" could not fail but disappoint. Watch it today - devoid of such high expectations - and you know what? It's still weak.An overview of history from caveman days to the French Revolution, ""History Of The World Part 1"" introduces us to such characters as Moses, Comicus the Roman stand-up philosopher, and King Louis XVI, all played by Brooks' favorite actor - Mel himself. In various bits, we see man emerge from erotically fixated primitives to erotically fixated primitives with silly wigs.""History Of The World"" is really two mini-movies, one about Comicus the Roman and the other a ""Tale Of Two Cities"" parody of the French Revolution in which King Louis is replaced by a lowly lookalike, played of course by Mel. A few other bits are thrown around in the way of padded one-liners, but it's really more like Brooks couldn't be bothered with shooting a full-length movie this time. The French one at least is funny in parts, but much of what shows up on screen seems too thin for a story conference, let alone a movie.And the jokes! Puerile third-grade schoolyard stuff. ""In the year 1,000,000 BC, it is thought the first homo sapien marriage occurred,"" intones Orson Welles as we watch caveman Sid Caesar club a woman over the head. ""It was shortly followed by the first homosexual marriage."" The Rome segment is just bizarre, with pointless cameos from Hugh Hefner and Henny Youngman and a long joke involving a chariot with a giant reefer.I believe Brooks' gradual decline as a filmmaker had to do with his increased focus on himself as central presence, and he really makes a case for it here. Why, in a film co-starring one of the great song-and-dance men of his generation, Gregory Hines, do you have the one big song-and-dance number star Mel Brooks?At least the French segment works somewhat in the classic Brooks vein, with some familiar faces from his other movies getting some quality time like Harvey Korman, Andreas Voutsinas, and Cloris Leachman, in the last of her Brooks crone roles as bitter Madame Defarge: ""We are so poor, we don't even have a language, just a stupid accent!""It's also the segment that delivers the best lines. ""It's good to be the king"" is what Louis says after molesting various ladies of the court, and Brooks is just right for the part there, probably because he WAS the king on the set and knew what he was talking about. Korman's ""Wait for the shake"" is also a favorite of mine, right up there with ""Walk this way"" and ""Where the white women at?"" from past Brooks' classics.But why Mel thought a chess gangbang would be so funny is lost on me, as is the comedy potential of a burping Dom DeLuise, or Jews being tortured by nuns in bathing suits. Call it hubris, but the sad fact was, for its many faults, ""History"" would be the last Brooks comedy that got within shouting distance of his ""Blazing Saddles"" peak. He could have just have easily subtitled this ""Decline And Fall"".",History of the World - Part I

Regulars Madeleine Kahn and Dom Deluise could not help lift the film. If his poor taste jokes don't put you off his work for life, then nothing will!

37,I_Ailurophile,"Quite enjoyable, if very uneven",6,29 July 2021,"I've had a tumultuous relationship with Mel Brooks films in the past and have been looking to revisit pictures I know little of, or wanted to try a second time. 'History of the world, Part I' includes the tone and all the staples that readily identify it as a Brooks feature, but it's been so long since I've seen it that I recalled little. Watching anew, it holds up reasonably well, but I'm inclined to think this is one of his weaker movies.The loose narrative construction, relying on sketches broken down by eras in human history, allows for a wide and exciting variety of costume design, set design and decoration, props, and makeup. It also arguably enables Brooks to explore more ideas in one movie than would be the case for a single cohesive story. On the other hand, the use of mostly unrelated sketches also makes 'History' more difficult to become invested in as a viewer; some parts are definitely stronger than others.For lack of verbal dialogue with which to render jokes, ""The Stone Age"" relies on sight gags and physical comedy to earn laughs. It succeeds, but it also grows tiresome after a time. It's not that this segment is bad, but it's more that I'm glad it doesn't represent the whole film, because that would have been a chore to view for 90 minutes.Consisting of a single quick scene, ""The Old Testament"" leads quickly into ""The Roman Empire,"" and from here on out there's gratifyingly more approaches to humor. With the introduction of verbal dialogue and definite characters, we're treated to one liners, deliberately anachronistic contemporary references, exaggerated characterizations and scenarios, prop comedy, puns, word play - and even a particularly fantastic scene of stand up comedy. The work behind the scenes that went into realizing ancient Rome is especially wonderful, with art direction that ably builds the sense of the strong empire and focal point of civilization that the city represented. I also love Madeline Kahn as Empress Nympho, hamming it up with a swell comedic performance with all the great skill we've seen from her time and again.""The Spanish Inquisition"" is easily my favorite part of 'History,' though: This sketch handily upends all expectations, therefore becoming ever more an uproarious delight. It's almost certainly the most carefully, lovingly crafted part of the movie, with swell choreography complementing set design that blows away all that precedes and follows. If I remember nothing else from watching this picture, Brooks' treatment of the Inquisition is marvelously unforgettable.At last that brings us to ""The French Revolution."" Maintaining all the comedic stylings of the previous sketches, there are some especially clever jokes, a slight sense of a comedy of errors - and some very notable instances of breaking the fourth wall. As Brooks has in his other features, 'History' plays fast and loose with cinematic boundaries, allowing his characters to be aware of the movie they're a part of. Once again: There's no mistaking who made this film; that Brooks himself appears as several characters is the least of the identifiers.In addition to the generally less cohesive feel of a full-length sketch movie, I do feel somewhat that Brooks' treatment of the French Revolution suffers a bit from the same issue that weakens his presentation of the Roman Empire. Both these segments are noticeably longer than the other story threads. For as funny as Brooks is broadly, mostly compartmentalizing 'History' somewhat meant limiting the scope of the jokes and humorous narrative writing. As a result, the longer these aspects draw on, the less capably they held my attention. While it's not a direct comparison, I'm reminded of the difference in the later episodes of 'Monty Python's Flying Circus,' where a slight change in cast and production, and a shift toward longer sketches, dulled the bite that the series had otherwise held previously.As if to emphasize the point, I feel like the sharp punch of the ""coming attractions"" that concludes 'History' bests the humor of the film's longer segments.I do rather enjoy this, but even with incomplete knowledge of Mel Brooks' filmography, I think it stands a little lower beside the likes of 'Spaceballs,' 'Dracula: Dead and loving it,' or 'Robin Hood: Men in tights.' Excellent production standards, a strong cast, and an especially electrifying examination of the Spanish Inquisition are counterbalanced by comedy watered down in sketches that run too long.Who are we kidding, though: faults and all, 'History of the world, Part I' is a comedy classic, quite worth checking out for Brooks fans and general audiences alike. It's not his best work, but is nonetheless a staple of cinematic farce that everyone should see at least once.",History of the World - Part I
38,rbverhoef,"Not as funny as most of Brooks, but still worth watching",6,8 October 2005,"Mel Brooks delivers funny movies. 'The Producers', 'Blazing Saddles' and for me especially 'Young Frankenstein' belong the funniest I have seen. They told a story from tart to finish and the jokes found their way into that story. 'History of the World: Part I' is again funny, but it is very flawed as well. This movie does not tell a story with gags in it, it tells gags with a couple of stories around it.Mel Brooks seems to have chosen a couple of events in our history, at random, as long as his jokes would fit there. We start with the dawn of men, the stone age and a story around the ten commandments. These segments are not that long and I found them hilarious. The narrator, Orson Welles, explains us how things started back then, things like singing and painting. It is the kind of humor that requires a certain taste, but if you like it Mel Brooks is as good as it gets. Most of the time.We continue with longer segments including one in the Roman Empire which starts great but after a while it overstays its welcome, a musical number dealing with the Spanish Inquisition that has the same problem, and one during the French Revolution that is not that funny at all. Especially in these sequences we see how Brooks has the idea of a funny gag, puts a story around it without really doing something with both the idea of the gag and the story. It is like watching Jim Carrey doing funny faces without a reason for doing that. His funny face can be funny when it is serving something, it is not simply funny on its own.Near the end Brooks finds his way again and shows us what we could expect in Part II. I laughed like I did in the first half of the movie and that gave me the feeling the movie is funnier and better than it actually is. Fans of the genre will enjoy this enough, there is some real Mel Brooks magic here, but if you are still finding out whether you like this or not I would start somewhere else. 'Young Frankenstein' would be a nice choice.",History of the World - Part I
39,nycritic,"Isolated, mildly funny moments can't make this movie work.",4,5 September 2004,"A pity that a director like Mel Brooks, responsible for such classics like ""The Producer"", the one-two 1974 punch of ""Young Frankenstein"" and ""Blading Saddles"", and the less successful but still entertaining ""High Anxiety"" fell flat on his face with this clunker. While it starts out with the promising Orson Welles voice-over (spoofing his own ""War of the Worlds"" narration as a nifty in-joke) in the first segment (which also spoofs the ape men sequence from Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey""), the rest quickly plummets in one un-funny after un-funny succession.Sid Caesar gives all he has for his short bit as the lead caveman (and granted, the entry works). Moses fails to deliver and whatever comic intent there is shatters just like his extra table of commandments. Only the Bea Arthur scene works in the Roman Empire segment -- even Madeline Kahn's presence can't save what is a badly written part -- and here the movie completely sinks into incoherence with unrelated ""funny"" scenes added as supposed hilarity, for example, when a man carries a very dated boom box and listens to ""Funkytown"". The Last Supper sequence is fairly descent and somewhat brings back ""History..."" a little luster, but the Spanish Inquisition, a segment obviously intended as a nod to Hollywood musicals from the 1930s, is quite arguably the worst sketch in the entire movie. The French Revolution begins well, bringing Harvey Korman, Cloris Leachman, and Andreas Katsoulas, all Brooks veterans, back on film in small but memorable parts, but not long after this segment begins that it goes down, down under and never bothers to recover itself. The fact that Mel Brooks also decided to play five roles here makes it the more irritating. One can only guess he did so due to his own star power (or maybe he believed he could do an Alec Guiness). His entry as the King in the last sequence is so cringe-inducing [""It's good to be the king!""] that it's a relief when that bad joke is over and THE END appears on the horizon with a title montage reminiscent of the all-caps title LAND OF THE GIANTS.I personally am glad of his success with his own revival of ""The Producers."" His recent appearance at the season finale of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" only cements his reputation even more as he spoofs his revival using Larry David, of all people as the lead, in order for it to flop. It only furthers to show he can make a fantastically funny visual story (or appear in one) when he chooses to, but this movie is only for die-hard fans.",History of the World - Part I
40,brando647,I've Come to Appreciate Brooks' HISTORY a Lot More,7,25 March 2017,"After poking fun at all manner of film genres, Mel Brooks turns his attention to the past with HISTORY OF THE WORLD PART I. I've always considered this one of Brooks' second tier movies, never getting as much love as classics such as SPACEBALLS or BLAZING SADDLES. Watching it again for the first time in more than a decade, it's actually better than I remember. Maybe my tastes have evolved or maybe I just couldn't have cared less about jokes on the French aristocracy as a teenager, but I know I wasn't giving it enough credit. HISTORY OF THE WORLD PART I is a collection of vignettes where Brooks satirizes different eras in human history including the Roman Empire, the Spanish Inquisition, the French Revolution, and more. It brings together most of your favorite Brooks' comedy collaborators (no Gene Wilder, unfortunately) and adds a few new faces to the mix. With narration from Orson Welles, watch as Moses (Brooks) presents the world with the Ten Commandments, experience the excitement of an ancient Roman ""stand-up philosopher"" (also Brooks) and an Ethiopian slave standing up against the lethargic Emperor Nero (Dom De Luise), and learn why it's ""good to be the king"" as Brooks pulls double-duty as King Louis XVI and his doppelganger Jacques, the man who holds the urine bucket. It's a lesson in world history from the twisted mind of one of cinema's greatest comedy filmmakers where you're bound to learn something, maybe. Don't. Don't watch this for education purposes.I feel like HISTORY OF THE WORLD PART I is sort of the black sheep of Mel Brooks' filmography. I'd put it in the top tier of his projects but it doesn't get as much vocal love as his classic hits. I hadn't even thought about this movie in years. It had completely fallen off my radar until I bought the Mel Brooks collection. It used to play on cable pretty regularly; I'm pretty sure I'd originally seen it on Comedy Central way back when. Not so much anymore, so this was a fresh start for me. I could remember bits and pieces and a general feeling of indifference toward the movie. I am so glad I got the chance to re-watch it because it's so much funnier than I remember. It's a collection of vignettes so, as with any sort of anthology film, some pieces will be better than others but I'm happy to report that the movie has more highs than lows. The film gets off to a slower start with a segment relating the struggles of early cavemen led by Sid Caesar. It's mostly cheesy slapstick that didn't appeal much to me, with the exception of the creation of the first art critic. After that, the movie is pretty solid. It droops a little again in the final stretch when we're covering the French Revolution because it doesn't appear Brooks could find a whole lot more to skewer than Louis' libido, but even that has memorable moments.The highlights of HISTORY OF THE WORLD PART I are definitely the Roman Empire and the Spanish Inquisition. The Roman segment is my personal favorite and occupies the majority of the film's first hour. It contains some of the best gags and features Madeline Kahn, Dom De Luise, and Gregory Hines as supporting characters. The Spanish Inquisition, on the other hand, is a short segment where Brooks can indulge in his love for musical numbers. I was never keen on the Spanish Inquisition number as a kid but I've taken a shine to it now. It's a fun, Broadway-style extravaganza with synchronized swimmers and medieval torture. What's not to love? On a similar note, I should point out the fantastic production design on this film. This could almost count as Brooks' own parody of classic epic Hollywood films. Each of these segments (except for maybe the Moses bit, which is all set on a small, contained mountain side set) utilizes some impressive design and use of matte paintings that looks like parts out of BEN-HUR or something of that nature. HISTORY OF THE WORLD PART I is a fun watch, even if it never rises to the top of the pile in Brooks' work. I could even see myself re-watching it again more often than BLAZING SADDLES or YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN just because of its variety. I only regret that Brooks never intended on making a PART II because I've been waiting years to see the ""Jews in Space"" segment teased before the end credits expanded to its full glory.",History of the World - Part I
41,mattymatt4ever,Mel Brooks--You da man!!!!,8,24 June 2001,"Another hilarious outing for genius comedy writer/director Mel Brooks.  He once again graces us with his incomparable talent.  Brooks' method of spoofing historical events and topping it off with a little off-color humor is very impressive indeed.  The first two acts are hilarious!  I could not stop laughing!  There's a good deal of memorable moments that fans of Mel will remember for ages and ages.  One (which often comes up in retrospectives) is the scene where Moses (played by Brooks) has to deliver his Fifteen--I mean, Ten Commandments. Another moment I will always remember is when Comicus (also Brooks as a stand-up philosopher in ancient Greece--Yes, you heard right) is the waiter for Jesus and his disciples when Leonardo Da Vinci paints his famous work ""The Last Supper.""  Comicus repeatedly yells ""Jesus"" and Jesus repeatedly responds, ""What?""  I really got a kick out of that.  Expect many great performers (many of which are regulars in Brooks' work) including the late Madeline Kahn, Gregory Hines, Sid Caesar, Harvey Korman, Cloris Leachman and others.  Another great ensemble cast for another great Mel Brooks comedy!I also have to note the great Spanish Inquisition musical number--another classic moment.  This includes a cameo by buddy Carl Reiner (""Talkamatta! You can't talkamatta anything!"").  I admit, towards the end the comedy sags a bit.  The gags in the third act aren't as memorable as the previous ones. 
So if you're a fan of the Brooksmeister--or just a fan of good comedy!--please check out this gem.  You won't be disappointed!  History has never been this fun!My score:  8 (out of 10)",History of the World - Part I

43,Mister-6,An epic of comedic proportions....,10,12 November 1999,"This is, without a doubt, one of my favorite comedies of all time, coming as it does from Mel Brooks as it successfully skewers such movie staples as the big-budget epic, musicals and, of course, sequel-itis.Mel (in my humble yet informed opinion) has never been in better form during the '80s as he was here: lashing out in full force as writer, director and actor against the stoic straightness of history with a sardonic smile and twisted wit.  He surrounds himself with a more-than-capable cast, including such mega-star comics as Caesar (whose caveman seemed to develop all of man's first inventions all by himself), Kahn (his eternal diva and a sassy diva at that), Greene (pompous, puffed-up and ready to pop), DeLuise (making slobbery a pure art form), Korman (Hedley Lamaar in royal French garb - and still as funny), and even such loyal stand-bys as Carter, Murray, Milligan and DeLuca offer able-bodied support.But let's not forget Hines.  In his first major motion picture role as Josephus, he shucks and jives, sand-dances and withstands the fiery dancing of Caledonia like a pro.  Just an inkling of what his career had to offer later on, and a perfect calling-card for a future in show business.And the jokes!  There are some classic Mel bits here that have stood the test of time and will continue to do so.  Such classic bits as ""The Inquisition"", Comicus' first gig at Caesar's Palace, the Caveman's critique of that cave painting, ""Count duh money, count duh money!"", that obscene French chess game, even the coming attractions offer a few smiles.But how can anyone cite certain favorites?  The whole movie is a grab bag of jokes, many off-color and sure to offend.  As if Mel made ""Blazing Saddles"" to please everyone...yeah, right.In the end, ""History"" was the passing of an era, since Mel has made fewer movies as ""R""-rated, raunchy, raucous, dis-respectful and belly-laughable as this one.  He's still good, mind you, but just watch this one and see if you don't agree: what a wonderful ""World"".Ten stars and a true sense of ""awww"" for ""History of the World, Part I"". Just ask Mel, he'll tell you - it's good to be king.",History of the World - Part I
44,Hollywood_Yoda,Don't Expect a Part II,10,19 September 2006,"Mel Brooks does it again, this time with history. And if you saw the title and expected a Part II, you are out of luck. Most of Brooks films conclude with a spoof sequel. From the rise of (a very slow and lazy) man to the French Revolution, we are shown what history may have been like, if Mel Brooks were God. Biblical proportions such as Mel Brooks playing Moses with the ""original"" 15 commandments (he drops a tablet) and now we have ""10, the 10 Commandments."" This reminded me of a sequence on Saturday Night Live, where President Clinton's ancestor questions each of the Commandments (See ""Best of the Clinton Scandal""). In another segment, we see a younger Hugh Hefner in the streets of Rome. He is explaining to some girls the concept of what a ""centerfold"" is. Gregory Hines is of note for his first feature film, and comes out funny. With that and all else, I had to give this ""Mel Brooks Masterpiece"" an excellent 10 of 10 rating.",History of the World - Part I
45,Pedro_H,Guinness Book of Record's attempt for most crass sex jokes in a movie.,5,3 September 2003,"Slapdash trawl through history which contains nothing whatsoever besides camera mugging, crude sex gags and chase scenes. While I would try and not be Chinese-like in rewriting history there cannot be many comedians as indifferent as Brooks. Capable of making classic films like Young Frankenstien and even the Elephant Man he is also capable of making stinkers of such desperation that you wonder what goes through his head. Is he trying to second guess the audience (if so then his opinions of the audience must be low) or does he really think things like twenty men (all clothed) jumping on a woman while he shouts ""gang bang - gang bang"" is funny?Indeed the expense of film would make a normal person think twice about using expensive locations (a real French court, for example) to play out underdeveloped sketches that differ from 1950's TV only because of swear words and sexual references. Indeed you wonder if he can think of any other subject to make jokes about? Being the script writer, producer, director and lead(s) hardly leads you to think that he is a democrat; although I am sure his repertory company of glad-to-have-jobs probably don't care as they are clearly unwanted elsewhere.  The problem is that Brooks is not really all that good an actor (he wants to ""whey-hey"" in to camera after every gag, presumably to allow time for  the cinema audience to climb off the floor)  or dancer and he his singing shouldn't leave his own bathroom. Why are all these things included? Desperation? There can't be any other reason.",History of the World - Part I
46,grahamsj3,Just plain silly,5,12 February 2004,"This is supposed to be a comedy, but is just plain silly, which, to me is the antithesis of actual comedy. I expected something a bit more ""grown up"" than what this turned out to be. I thought that the basic premise was good, but that the film failed to exploit it, being too busy being sophomoric and silly. It wasn't bad, and there is definitely some funny material in the film, but overall, it just doesn't quite live up to Brook's other material (Young Frankenstein or Blazing Saddles). It was as disappointment to me. It's surprising, particularly given it's cast, most of whom are known for good comedy work. So I must blame the writing. I guess even Mel Brooks is allowed to write a bad one once in a while. Well, this is it!",History of the World - Part I
47,raymond-15,Humorous look at an erratic world.,6,11 July 2007,"Mel Brooks who wrote and directed this film pokes fun at some of the past events that rocked the world. In rewriting history from his suggestive and bawdy view point, he introduces us to some hilarious moments. Despite the exaggerations there is probably an ounce of truth in some of the questionable scenes he has portrayed.Film goers with a long memory will recognize scenes, music and dialogue from the flicks they enjoyed years ago and now with the passage of time wonder why they were so enthralled at those Saturday night movies. It's a part of the fun to recall the old films and a second viewing is probably needed to ensure that none of the funny bits are missed.The scenes are well mounted and I have a suspicion that the large sets are snippets of past films with garrisons of Roman soldiers filling the screen and crowds of French on-lookers for the scenes of the guillotine. I think my favourite segments are the surprise entry of the nuns in the Spanish Inquisition (possibly because I had a few days earlier watched the Secret Files of the Inquisition) and the French Revolution in which a portable pissoir adds to the bawdiness of the times. Could there ever have been such an enterprising invention? Mel Brooks' humour is not subtle and the slap-stick approach could probably be best enjoyed after a few drinks with friends. I have to admit I was not rocked with laughter but have to conclude he shows a degree of cleverness and originality in the writing. Yes, I did laugh a couple of times It's an awesome project to write the history of the world and a lot more has happened since the French Revolution. Will he put his pen to paper again and enlighten us on the era of nuclear weapons and global warming? Heaven knows the world could do with a little more laughter.

The film is not as all encompassing as its title implies, but Mel gives his own twisted vision to these particular times in earth's history, which includes Mel himself in four different roles, including Moses and his own version of Louis XIV (It's Good to be the King). Mel gathers his usual nutty repertory company together and laughs are provided by Sid Ceasar (very funny as a caveman), Madeline Kahn and Dom DeLuise (hysterical as Cleopatra and Ceasar), Gregory Hines, Cloris Leachman, and Harvey Korman as Count De Money (""That's De Monay!!!). As always in his films, music is key and the Spanish Inquisition is presented here as a mammoth production number that is guaranteed to either amuse or offend,depending on your mood.

Brooks and his usual gang of actors skewers just about every major event in history that can be crammed into ninety minutes.   Sure there are some events that get passed over, but what's left for us to see is a hoot.  We see the Roman Empire, the Spanish Inquisition and the French Revolution skewered with Brooks' own brand of humor.

Using Caesar's Palace as a backdrop for the Roman Empire makes me smile just remembering it. The whole Caesar - Marcus Vindictus verbal exchange is priceless. The Inquisition sketch. The first Homo-Sapiens and Homo-Sexual weddings. And the previews for the Part II. But that's it. Some 15 minutes of the movie make sense to me.Maybe it is because I come from a different cultural background. Then again, I usually laugh at U.S. humor.

I don't appreciate sight gags so I was surprised when I laughed at some comic scenes in the Inqusition sequence. The very idea of nuns doing a water ballet a la Esther Williams is hilarious and Brooks pulled it off with stunning visual appeal. The song for that segment was great too with its catchy rhythm and coyly cruel lyrics. ""It's better to lose your skull cap than your skull."" I am a sucker for funny repartee and witty one liners. A sign at the orgy festival in the Roman Empire segment: ""First served, first come."" How about Count de Monet (Harvey Korman in the French Revolution segment) bickering with his partner: ""Don't get saucy with me, Bernaise!"" King Louis the XVI being warned that the peasants were ""revolting"": ""You're telling me!"" A gladiator out of work being grilled at the welfare office by a social worker (wonderfully played deadpan by Beatrice Arthur): ""Did you kill yesterday? Did you try to kill today. Are you going to try to kill tomorrow?"" And Mel Brooks as a ""stand-up philosopher"" describing his profession as something like a condenser of ideas into their ephemeral essences. The welfare lady surmises: ""Oh, you are a bullshit artist,"" and goes on a ""wine break."" Since seeing this movie I have to suppress a smile whenever I am being led by a receptionist, guard or usher into a facility with the direction ""Walk this way."" Mel's best joke at Caesar's Palace was : ""We Romans have a god for everything. The only thing we don't have a god for is premature ejaculation. But I heard that's coming too soon."" The centurion testing whether the Gregory Hines character was really a eunuch presents a woman to perform what he called an ""erratic dance"" which it truly was. I wonder if I was the only one who got the joke. The serving maid to Empress Nympho (Madeleine Kahn)looked very familiar and was a great foil to Kahn.I stopped asking waiters at restaurants I visit for the first time what's their specialty ever since I saw this movie. Why? I may be given something like the ""mold wine"" Mel's boss, the tratorria owner kept telling him to push because they were overstocked with it. The ""swimming nuns"" portion in the Inquisition episode while a spoof of Esther Williams films is a wonderful visual treat.

Of course, Brooks is also playing the pee (sic) boy, which is why there is a resemblance.The movie is a series of skits from the times of the caveman up to the French Revolution. The Roman Empire skit is also hilarious.Brooks' comedies are brilliant and this is one I highly recommend. I believe that ratings should be subject to what the film is trying to accomplish.

66,abum190,Just not as funny as it should be,5,6 September 2006,"There are a few inspired bits, but nothing to rest a whole movie on, and that's exactly what Brooks has attempted to do- base an entire movie on a few cheap tricks that don't really deliver in the first place.Brooks' best work (Young Frankenstein, The Producers) had both inspired bits and strong stories to keep them going. History of the World: Part I has only a little of the former and none of the latter. The reason the movie doesn't fail completely is because there are glimpses of genius hidden in it- the Spanish Inquisition scene, for example, or both the performances of Madeline Kahn and Cloris Leachman. The Pissboy joke fits in that category too.But that's pretty much it. A few of the jokes, like the 10 Commandments one, have been replayed over and over in the popular consciousness that it's just not funny on screen. It was worth seeing, if only because it's a Mel Brooks movie and it reinforces how great his better movies are, but I don't care to see it again.",History of the World - Part I
67,TYLERdurden74,Cult Movies 37,10,9 November 1998,"37. HISTORY OF THE WORLD PART 1 (comedy, 1981) A farcical telling of the history of the world. From the 'Stone Age' to the French revolution.Critique: Though many critics (and fans) regard Mel Brooks' first film, 'The Producers' (1968), as his masterpiece, I consider this to be his funniest and most innovative work. With Brooks' giving a tour-De-force-comedy role as writer, director and actor.Narrated by 'monochrome voiced' Orson Welles, it stars many of Brooks' regular troop including: Cid Ceaser, Mel Torme, and Gregory Hines in his first starring role as the Roman slave Josephus (from 'Ethiopia . . .105th street'). The film opens with the 'Dawn of Man' sequence (modeled after '2001'), as the 'man-apes' stand up and become humans, masturbating to the classical theme of 'Thus Spake Zarathustra'. Then we move to the 'Stone Age' where we see how comedy, music and the first 'homo-sapien' (and'Homo-sexual') marriages came to be. The scene then shifts to the brief Old Testament sequence where Moses (Mel Brooks) descends from Mount Sinai with the '15' (and not 10) commandments. Then comes the center piece of the film, the Roman period which follows Comicus (Brooks again) and his attempts at getting a job as a 'stand-up philosopher' in Caesar's Palace. We are also introduced to the character of Josephus, Caesar (Dom DeLouis), Swiftus (Comicus partner) and Susan (a 'vestal virgin'). 'The Spanish Inquisition' period becomes a musical where the monks exact torture on Jews with song and dance. The last part deals with the French Revolution as King Louie is replaced by the ""piss boy"" to escape execution (a take off on Dumars' 'The Man in the Iron Mask'). The film's humor comes from the fact that everything said is taken literally. When Caesar asks for a ""small liar"" to play, his guard brings him a small thief. What also makes it funny is the many sexual references throughout, especially in the French period where ""it's good to be the King!"".

I remember sitting stone faced throughout waiting for it to get good and even being offended just a little bit. My girlfriend loves this movie so she got me to watch it and I must say 20 years has not changed my perception one bit as far as this film goes. I think I may have guffawed once or twice and apart from that sat through countless awkward moments and blown gags. I actually felt sorry for Mel in some scenes and found myself thinking I wasn't going to make it through, but alas, it is mercifully short which saves it from being among the absolute worst of all time.

Nothing rises above the level of grade school potty humor. What a waste of a terrific cast! Mel Brooks was never known for subtlety, but in ""Young Frankenstein"", ""Blazing Saddles"" and especially ""The Producers"", there are many bits of brilliant adult satire to balance out the groaners.

""History of the World"" is a big disappointment. I saw it in the theater when it was originally released. While it made me laugh once in a while, more often than not the jokes were either unfunny or, based on having seen other Brooks movies, predictable.For example, if you saw ""Silent Movie"" and remember what happened when the studio execs reacted to the gorgeous starlet, then in ""HOWT,"" the means of testing to see which man is not a eunuch is obvious long before the visual joke is played out.Here and there throughout there are genuine laughs to be had, but ""HOWT"" falls far below the bar that Brooks' previous films set.",History of the World - Part I

I especially love how Brooks, in all his movies, plays several different roles. I figure, if you want it done right, sometimes you just have to do it yourself.However funny it might be, there are definitely some raunchy parts. Which were pretty uncomfortable in a class setting, especially when we had several young folks in the room. I found out when I got home today that it was rated R. Woops. There is no way that it would be rated that today though. There isn't any nudity, its just a WHOLE lot of sexual jokes.

The Roman Empire story also comes off good (especially the great supporting actors in this segment) and be sure to stay tuned for the trailer for ""Part 2"".

82,busterbuff61,Mel Brooks as the 20-million-year-old man,8,10 January 2013,"This movie did middling box-office (as did all Mel Brooks movies from this point on), but for my money, it's one of Brooks's funniest. Having made his reputation with the 2000-Year-Old Man, it seems inevitable that Brooks would eventually take on the spectrum (or sphincter, as he might put it) of world history. And in the age of the Farrelly Brothers, Brooks' ideas about bad taste seem almost quaint.It begins with a lot of black-out gags (the first such gag amounting to, Ape Man = Onan) and takes off from there. The first sustained sequence, The Roman Empire, probably goes on a bit too long, and it ""introduced"" a buxom actress named Mary-Margaret Humes who, justifiably, went right back to obscurity shortly after the film's release. But there are also many enjoyable moments: Gregory Hines's mellow film debut, Madeline Kahn's ecstatic song tribute to her well-endowed male slaves, and most of all, the Last Supper sequence at the end--completely messed up time-wise (it puts Jesus and Leonardo da Vinci in the same shot), but all the more hilarious because of it. (John Hurt plays Jesus, and as in Brooks' ""Spaceballs,"" his straight-faced seriousness just makes the insanity around him that much funnier.) The next sequence is one of Brooks' best: The Spanish Inquisition as a Marx Brothers-style musical number, with Mel Brooks as a socko Torquemada, beating out a rhythm on his victim's shackled knees. This sequence alone justifies Brooks's existence as a comedy director.The sequence depicting The French Revolution, has two main objectives in mind: show off as much of (1) British comedienne Pamela Stephenson's bust and (2) Brooks's wee-wee humor as humanly possible. Nevertheless, it has its moments, with Cloris Leachman as Madame Defarge, and Brooks as a randy king.The final short sequence, a trailer for Brooks's non-existent ""History Part II,"" is worth the bother just for one of those moments that makes me laugh for no discernible reason: a scene from ""Hitler on Ice,"" showing Brooks' favorite nasty German as an Ice Capader. This ersatz trailer is enough to make me wish Brooks had really made a sequel. I doubt it would have turned out any worse than ""Spaceballs.""",History of the World - Part I

84,Joekingfans,"Like The Line In The Inquisition Song, ""What A Show!""",10,16 January 2008,"The ""Part I"" in the title of the film was kind of an inside joke about sequels and film series. After all, if they have a ""Rocky II,"" ""Rocky III,"" ""Rocky IV,"" ""Rocky V,"" etc., how come there was never a ""Rocky I?"" Mel Brooks delivers a critique of today's religion and politics but with characters and situations set ages ago. After all, the proverbial question set by characters from thousands of years ago, ""But what about the poor?"" The ""F Word"" reply given in unison by the chorus of ancient politicians was really a social commentary on contemporary politics. Mel Brooks' musical extravaganza on ""The Inquisition"" was not just a commentary of a dark, violent, regrettable page of history on the Catholic Church, but a commentary on a few aspects of today's religious issues. Some people in the audience may have felt that some of the religious humor was too disrespectful, with characters in the scenes like Moses, Jesus, priests, nuns, etc. The rule of thumb on that is that you can have Biblical and religious characters in your humor, as long as you're making fun with them, rather than at them. After all, when was the last time you thought about God? Anytime people start talking and thinking about religion, their beliefs or disbeliefs, it's good. It's thought provoking. It would be too ""in your face"" to use contemporary public figures to make commentary like that. After all, this is a Mel Brooks motion picture for the movie theater where you pay for a ticket and expect quality -- not an episode of ""Saturday Night Live"" that keeps recycling old jokes with new faces. That's why it's good taste to make your comedic critique with characters and situations set hundreds or thousands of years ago as Mel Brooks did in the first place.

Every sequence has plenty of great bits, and you could watch it all the way through or just pop in the disc to see your favorite part.The Inquisition musical sequence is one of my favorites, and will be a favorite of anyone who likes Brooks' other musical numbers (especially now, with the ""Producers"" a broadway smash.)  Unlike another reviewer, I *never* get tired of the skeet-shooting with peasants scene.  Madame DeFarge running out of wool should give a good chuckle to anyone who's read ""Tale of Two Cities,"" as will the old man with his birds in the Bastille.Some of the jokes flop, but the ones that don't more than make up for it.

86,Slaphammer1,Both better and worse than expected....,9,26 February 2001,"I recently acquired the DVD version of History of the World Part 1.  While I saw this movie many times as a kid and loved it, I hadn't seen it in quite a while and was looking forward to seeing the ""real"" version without all the censoring for TV play (I've only seen this on TV, although I can't say for certain whether I ever saw it on a movie channel where it wasn't censored). After watching the DVD, it turns out that some parts of the film are even funnier than I remembered, while others didn't make me laugh as much as they used to.I found that the first half of the movie was by far the most funny...all the way through the Roman Empire segment (which is probably the longest segment in the film).  Even though I knew most of the jokes that were coming up, they made me laugh anyway, and there were several jokes that I had either forgotten or which had been cut out/mangled by TV censors so I hadn't seen them.  Although I knew I liked this movie, I found myself surprised at how hilarious it was.Then came the Spanish Inquisition sequence.  I remember not really liking this scene as a kid, but then I've never been into musicals.  This time around, I liked it a lot better...I don't have a negative impression of it anymore.  Still, it's not quite as funny as the earlier parts of the film.The last bit of the movie is the French Revolution -- I remembered lots of funny stuff in this segment from when I watched this movie long ago. However, this segment is where the movie was a bit disappointing...a lot of the jokes which I used to find hilarious (such as skeet-shooting with peasants) just didn't click with me like I expected them to.  Also, I found that the number of gags in this segment was significantly reduced from previous parts.  I have fond memories of the French Revolution segment, so I'm a bit puzzled as to why it didn't do much for me now.  Maybe I just remembered TOO MUCH from this segment so there were very few surprises?But as a whole, I definitely think this ranks as one of Mel Brooks' best films.  I count it as part of the ""holy trinity"" along with Young Frankenstein and Blazing Saddles.  Others have said that this is one of Brooks' raunchiest films, and I definitely agree.  There are quite a few sexual gags in this, and several uses of the ""F"" word (I don't remember that word being used at all in Young Frankenstein or Blazing Saddles, but maybe I've just forgotten...).

I find the scene in the Roman Forum amusing; Madeline Kahn makes the most of the very short scene that features her; and the Spanish Inquisition is memorable--but it's no match for Monty Python's TV skit and its absurd incongruities. With the exception of ""Young Frankenstein"", the opening 20 minutes of ""The Producers"" (especially the original, 1968 version) and, grudgingly, ""Blazing Saddles"", HOTW is like every other Mel Brooks movie: same stereotypical references, same uneven pacing--as though the actors are pausing for the laugh from a live audience--and not much that's truly fresh and original. Watch it once, just so you can reference it as needed, and judge for yourself.",History of the World - Part I
103,jetm76-1,All sarcasm,8,22 May 2006,"Every part on this irreverent, and I like that. The dawn of the humanity, the ancient Egypt, Rome and the future. Everybody, God included is the objective in this picture, in every moment I think that the story is sarcastic, I imagine that this film had problems with every religious group of the planet. The first time I saw that film was 13 years old and in the end I slept, but no for the boring, in Colombia was presented too late in the night, years later I remembered it and I knew it is a brilliant film. The films wouldn't have fear and Mel Brooks, The Great Mel Brooks knows that, thank you Mel for the smile. Thanks for the laughing.",History of the World - Part I
104,backusjim,this movie should be a classic,8,8 August 2005,"Orson Wells, Mel Brooks , together it's sound crazy , but they are together, the humor is elaborated. The biographical humor should be used more often, Mel take the risk and made this classic, the movie could be longer, the end is too soon. Music, jokes,scenarios.The years may pass and I'm sure some day people will realize that this movie should be considered a Classic, the phrases are so memorable, Mel Brooks should consider doing the second part after all. Despite the humor with English phrases here in sound America the jokes are very hilarious.If you want some quick jokes, fun, musical, and a Script with enough risk to mess with everyone this is your movie.",History of the World - Part I
105,maciejc,You have to watch this,10,6 April 2006,"There's no way you can hope to catch all the jokes in this movie (visual or verbal) without watching it multiple times. I have seen it at least 20 times and I still see things I missed before. This is one you have to see.You expect to see many gags in a Brooks movie, but this has to be one of his greatest ever.The whole cast is wonderful, with Hines and Kahn spectacular. Brooks is his usual self-effacing, brilliant self.It's just such a shame that Part II was never made - Hitler on Ice and Jews in Space would have been phenomenal !The Roman and French eras are the best, IMHO, but there's not a weak minute in the movie.Watch out for the bit where Comicvs and Swiftvs meet Oedipus -that's just a scream.And as for the stand-up Philosopher at Caesar's Palace, well that is the icing on the cake.",History of the World - Part I
106,rockrchicken,The Greatest,9,13 August 2006,In my opinion Mel Brooks (along with Woody Alen) is the greatest stand up philosopher around. I think this film really allowed him to shine through. Even though he played his usual (every part possible while directing) he still was fantastic. I would never expect any less from him. This movie is full of hilarious scenes that are easy to watch over and over. It is amazing. Not a lot of movies have that quality especially these new ones. There may be some parts in the movie where it isn't easy for the younger less knoledgeable ones to get the joke but it is jam packed with great quotes. highly suggest watching it again or watching it for the first time. whatever floats your boat.,History of the World - Part I

Watched it with my family while I was growing up, but I looked it up on here and while reading the description it says that it covers from old testament to French revolution. While that is true one part is forgotten, the prehistoric times.",History of the World - Part I

109,w_whitlock-1,This is a very important film for us all.,10,7 April 2004,"I think anyone that saw this film should have seen that it is possible to be religious and laugh at ourselves.  God created us and I think one of the things this movie shows is that He intended for us to have a sense of humor. I think it is brilliant as is Mel Brooks.  Members of our family and extended family use lines from this movie still today. Last family gathering one member told a joke that drew a couple of giggles and that was all...my nephew said ""when you die at the palace, you die at the palace"" and we all did belly laughs.  ""History of the World, Part 1"" is not just a movie it is a tribute to everyone that had anything to do with it.  It makes us laugh, a commodity there isn't enough of in this world.",History of the World - Part I
110,EskimoBobGuy,Great film. Endless Satire. Musical scenes tiring.,8,8 May 2004,"I really enjoyed History of the World, Part I. I had the opportunity to view it on the AMC Channel last night. As with most movies, I'm sure its even better on video/DVD. I loved it though. The only problem I had was this: The Inquisition scene was too cheesy. corny and tiring. Had this scene been shorter and funnier, I would have rated it a perfect 10, rather than 8. It still scores very high in my book, however, as does most Mel Brooks works. I'd like to recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed Robin Hood: Men in Tights, or Monty Python and the Holy Grail, as the comedy in them is much similar. Anyone who enjoys satire, even, would love this movie. I plan to get it on DVD or video if I get the chance, too! My one regret is I have yet to see even a preview for Part II. :(",History of the World - Part I
111,kassy-ssc,"More, More, More...",10,14 May 2004,"I loved this movie! I wish he would make another one like it. I heard of a Part II but have never seen it. I actually watched this movie so much I can repeat it word for word (almost) as well as wore the movie out! The pair of Brooks and Kahn were the best I have ever seen. They have done some amazing scenes in numerous films and I would LOVE to see more of them together. If there is actually a book II I would buy it and numerous copies for my family and friends. It is a shame that some of the actors are no longer around to participate in another film for this. Almost every film I have viewed of Mr. Brooks has been, in my eyes, a hit! Thank you Mr. Brooks for creating laughter and happiness in the lives of my family and me for all those years.",History of the World - Part I
112,s0n1cm0nk3y,"One of the funniest ""historical"" movies ever",10,4 January 2005,"I remember first seeing this movie when I was a child, and now at the age of 17 it still remains a classic in my mind. This movie's truly memorable moments stick in your mind forever. Anecdotes, and quotes from it are as frequent as those of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. So many double entendres, and single entendres, that just leave you laughing until the next one. Its a vicious cycle ladies and gents, trust me. This is not a movie that you will watch just once, oh know, this is one of Mel Brooks best, along the lines of Robin Hood : Men in Tights. But as a warning, if your the type that online likes teen comedies, or movies where the humor doesn't require the slightest bit of thinking, then you wont laugh as hard during this movie. To end this off with no spoilers, THIS IS AN EXCELLENT MOVIE, AND I'm STILL WAITING FOR PART II. Hitler ON ICE, WOOOOHOOOO!!!!",History of the World - Part I
