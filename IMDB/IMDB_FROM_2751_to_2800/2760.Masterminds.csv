0,SnoopyStyle,everybody is weird,4,5 December 2016,"David Ghantt (Zach Galifianakis) is a bumbling armor truck driver. Jandice (Kate McKinnon) is his bossy girlfriend. He's infatuated with coworker Kelly Campbell (Kristen Wiig) who accidentally fires her gun and gets fired. Three weeks later, her petty criminal friend Steve Chambers (Owen Wilson) comes up with an idea. They recruit sweet-natured David to steal from the company's vault. He cleans out $17 million. They give him fake ID Mike McKinney and send him to Mexico. FBI Agent Scanlon (Leslie Jones) leads the investigation. Steve turns David in for the reward but he manages to escape. Steve's wife (Mary Elizabeth Ellis) starts spending loads of money. They hire the real Mike McKinney (Jason Sudeikis) to kill David.Everybody is going full-on crazy weird. The problem is that it's rarely funny and the batting average is rather low. That takes away the comedy even when the jokes actually work. Director Jared Hess of Napoleon Dynamite fame is filling this 'real' story with wacky characters. I wonder if it would be funnier if he played it straight dead-pan. This cast is stacked but that might have driven them to try out-comedy each other.",Masterminds
1,boblipton,"We Can Still Make Fun Of These People, Can't We?",3,14 August 2020,"This is one of those comedies in which we are invited to laugh at rednecks because they are stupid.In this case, they steal $17 million and Zach Gallifinakis is set up to take the entire blame. It's one of those movies which I saw because of decent talent, particularly Kristen Wiig, and never quite worked up the will to leave early. I suspect it was a project that some talented people were drawn into because some one else was involve",Masterminds
2,nogodnomasters,I'd rob a funeral home for you,8,29 August 2017,"The film is based on a true story of an odd group of characters who robbed Loomis Fargo, the biggest bank heist in American history. The film centers on David Ghantt (Zach Galifianakis) who was sweet talked into the robbery by Kelly Campbell (Kristen Wiig). Steven Eugene Chambers (Owen Wilson) was the mastermind behind the robbery and failed to lay low and leave town.The film was a fairly decent comedy, even without the factor being based on an actual event. Zach plays a mild mannered character reminding me of Jack Black as Bernie. Good for a laugh.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity. Sexual innuendo, nothing explicit or overtly vulgar, such as: ""I don't want him to finger me"" type of stuff.",Masterminds
3,classicsoncall,"""Vaya con Dios, compadre.""",7,19 June 2017,"If this is based on a true story, and it was, I can't believe a bunch of nimrods like this were able to pull it off. Coming off looking even worse to my mind was the security company Loomis Fargo, which didn't seem to have any measures in place to prevent something like this from happening. The actual robbery took place in October of 1997, so that's not that long ago for the company to have gotten with the times. Having just read a summary of that heist, the details in the film are amazingly accurate, right down to the picture of Elvis hanging over the fireplace of the Chambers home. Unbelievable.As far as the movie goes, it's got it's share of hits and misses, with the funny parts coming across as slapstick more than anything else. I'm not a big fan of movies with Saturday Night Live alumni in them, and this one had a couple in Kristen Wiig and Kate McKinnon. Both were OK here and that's as much as I'll concede, but considering the inane nature of the story, they fit right in with the kind of forced humor the picture came up with.For some real laughs, stick around for the outtakes following the film because they're funnier than the movie itself. You know, The Bowery Boys made a 1949 movie titled ""Master Minds"", and in comparing the two one would be hard pressed to decide which one had a dumber cast of idiots. In the Bowery Boys flick, Huntz Hall is gifted with a mind reading ability to predict the future. If he could have told us about this one coming out in 2016, we would have all been better forewarned.",Masterminds
4,lee_eisenberg,just funny,8,12 June 2017,"Jared Hess's ""Masterminds"" is the sort of movie that you'll appreciate if you accept low humor. I do. It might be a surprise to learn that the movie is based on a true story (the October 1997 Loomis Fargo robbery). I'm sure that a lot of what the movie shows is added for comic relief, and to let the cast members do their stuff. Even so, they lay everything out quite well, as the scheme's main man sets up the armored car driver as a patsy.While Zach Galifianakis, Owen Wilson and Kristen Wiig are the top-billed stars, some of the best lines come from Leslie Jones (if she's in a movie, you know that it's gonna be good). As expected, Kate McKinnon and Jason Sudeikis also turn in good performances. Basically, the combination of the heist, the snappy dialogue, and the occasional gross-out humor makes for one funny movie. Betcha never thought that an Enya song would get used this way! It's also gotten noted that three of the four modern Ghostbusters star in this movie. 2016's ""Ghostbusters"" is a criminally underrated movie. It's hard to believe that there are people who call it one of the worst movies ever while still regarding as masterpieces the obnoxious ""Everyone Says I Love You"", the vacuous ""Eyes Wide Shut"", and the pointless ""Man on the Moon"".",Masterminds
5,zardoz-13,Masterminded Hilarity!!!,8,4 October 2016,"Sometimes, Hollywood uses the real names, real places, and real companies when it makes movies about historic events. Often, when filmmakers resort to the trite phrase 'based on a true story,' it is reason enough for us as moviegoers to suspect that everything about the film is phony from fade-in to fade-out. The long-awaited, true-crime, comedy of errors, heist caper ""Masterminds"" is probably something that Loomis Fargo & Company would love to forget. In October 1997, a Loomis employee stole over $17 million in cash from the regional office vault in its Charlotte, North Carolina, facility, making this robbery the third largest cash haul in American history. If this weren't devastating enough, Loomis had earlier lost a bundle in March 1997, when another of its employees disarmed two co-workers and then pilfered over $18 million in Jacksonville, Florida! At the time, the Jacksonville hold-up was the second largest cash robbery in America. Interestingly enough, although neither robbery was related, the Jacksonville thief stashed his loot in North Carolina. Surely, this treachery constitutes the kind of publicity that would make stockholders cringe in horror and competitors chuckle in amusement. Indeed, ""Napoleon Dynamite"" director Jared Hess and ""Hangover"" star Zach Galifianakis not only thought the Charlotte robbery was ideal material for a hysterical, goofball farce, but they also pulled out all stops to ensure sidesplitting hilarity. When you're not snickering at Galifianakis' screwball shenanigans as real-life armored car employee David Ghantt, you'll be laughing out loud at Ghantt's duplicitous accomplices who double-crossed him along with the Keystone Kops antics of both the FBI and the Mexican Federal Police. Unlike the far superior but hopelessly macabre Coen Brothers' epic ""Fargo,"" purportedly based on a genuine incident which later was exposed as apocryphal, ""Masterminds"" qualifies as featherweight, PG-13 rated, nonsense that cheerfully ridicules its Tar Heel robbers as much as it skewers its clueless law enforcement officials.Zach Galifianakis met David Scott Ghantt before he made the movie, and described him as ""a very sweet guy"" in an interview with the show-biz daily ""Variety."" Basically, Galifianakis portrays our protagonist as a 'Barney Fife' type. He is such an imbecile that he blasts a hole in the seat of his pants while he tries to holster his service revolver at a gunnery range. For the record, David couldn't hit a barn with a single bullet if he were standing inside it. David drives a small truck, but the driver's side door is a rectangle of wood attached to the door frame by house hinges. Until he hightails it to Mexico after the hold-up, David dresses in a short-sleeved uniform shirt and knee-length breeches so that he resembles an overgrown pageboy. His hair flounces around his shoulders like Prince Valiant, and he sports a full beard like King Arthur. Memorable comic characters must always appear idiotic because incongruity is the source of all humor. At one point, FBI Agent Scanlon (Leslie Jones of ""Ghostbusters"") refers to David contemptuously as the love child of Kenny Rogers and Kenny Loggins. Mentally, David is portrayed as a patsy. Sexy Loomis Armored co-worker Kelly Campbell (Kristin Wigg of ""Ghostbusters"") manipulates this affection starved rube into committing armed robbery. Little does dim-witted David know that the man behind seductive Kelly is avaricious Steve Chambers (Owen Wilson of ""Wedding Crashers"") who has been bugging Kelly to capitalize on David's infatuation with her. Meantime, our dubious hero is engaged to a humorless dame appropriately named Jandice (Kate McKinnon of ""Ghostbusters"") who lives with her mother in a trailer. Virtually everybody in ""Masterminds'' is trailer trash. Compared with Jandice, Kelly is a whirlwind of ideas and ambitions. Shamelessly, Kelly exploits David, but she relents later after she realizes how sweet David is on her. First, David piles $17 million into the back of a Loomis van. Second, through an oversight on his part, he destroys all but one of several surveillance cameras on the premises and confiscates the VHS tapes. While he is packing the bills into the van, he manages quite by accident to lock himself up inside it. Unable to extricate himself from the rear compartment, he relies on duct tape to stick enough stacks of currency together so he can mash down the gas pedal. Steve and Kelly are astonished when they see the Loomis van launch itself out of the warehouse like a Polaris missile and slam into a nearby ditch. Steve and his accomplices shield their faces and scramble to unload the vehicle. Since their first meeting in a country restaurant, Steve has carefully avoided letting David see his face. Once they've stashed the swag, Kelly stuffs $20 thousand in bills in David's jockey shorts. She disguises him in a long, blond wig that makes him look like a fruitcake, and he flies away to Mexico. Little does David know that Steve plans to cut him out of his shares after he identifies him to the authorities. Although he struggles to conceal his new found fortune, Steve screws up royally when his wife and he embark on a spending spree and buy a palatial mansion.Like his previous movies, including ""Napoleon Dynamite,"" ""Gentle Broncos,"" and ""Nacho Libre,"" Hess delivers exactly the same kind of bizarre comedy. Clocking in at a 95 trim minutes, ""Masterminds"" unwinds like a succession of ""Saturday Night Live"" skits bristling with sight-gags, down-home dialects, and clownish stereotypes (Hispanics may take offense.) Hess is a master of whimsical comedy, and his timing is impeccable. Moviegoers born after 1997 may marvel at how people communicated on mammoth hand-held phones and walkie-talkies. Galifianakis steals every scene with his outlandish costumes, until Jason Sudeikis shows up in an amusing supporting role as the kooky assassin that Steve sends to eliminate David. Leslie Jones' FBI agent will keep you in stitches, while Kate McKinnon is terrific as his fiancée. A spoof of armored car thrillers as much as film noir melodramas about puny-minded males, ""Masterminds"" will make you hoot and holler.",Masterminds
6,oscaralbert,"""Why isn't it milk?"" . . .",6,6 October 2016,". . . Zach Galifianakis gushes, with perfect seriousness, to Kristen Wiig during the turning-point restaurant scene of MASTERMINDS. Zach has just presented his crush Kristen with a pair of ""dethorned"" long-stemmed roses, with which she somehow manages to prick herself. Shortly thereafter, Zach spies a blood droplet on an upper left breast largely exposed by Kristen's low-cut blouse, at least three inches to the northeast of her corresponding nursing nozzle (covered up here, in accordance with national health department codes for public eateries). Zach's puzzled query indicates that he has grown up taking the Southern colloquialism for human feminine mammary glands (that is, ""Jugs"") quite literally. Therefore, his expectation is that punctured female breasts produce the same outcome that you'd get in ice-picking a plastic gallon of Homogenized Bovine Udder Pumpings commonly found in the dairy sections of local supermarkets: white ooze (as if a silicone-like liquid-filled bladder resides under the ""natural"" womanly chest protrusions, only always filled with baby juice). Obviously, the writers of MASTERMINDS are using this scene to highlight the sorry state of sex education in the American South.",Masterminds
7,FlashCallahan,The cast should hang their heads in shame......,3,29 November 2016,"A dim-witted armoured-car driver is lured into taking part in a massive heist by a seductive co-worker and her criminal accomplice. But when his partners steal the money and betray him, he is forced to evade a police detective and an eccentric hit man while seeking his revenge........The word talent should be used very loosely, because all the main cast members have had various levels of success over the years, but talent wanes after a while for some people, so I'll rephrase the old adage.Considering the amount of 'recognisable' faces in this film, it's really surprising that this film does not have one single laugh in its mercifully short running time.And if I were the subject of the film (it's based loosely on a true story) I'd be talking to my solicitors, because he's portrayed as one of the most gullible characters seen on screen in a long time.But it's not just the film makers fault, some of the cast hardly make an effort with the film, and it's glaringly obvious for a couple of the stars.Galafianakis schtick was endearing for a couple of films, but now, he's been doing the same thing for over seven years, and it's just becoming grating, the oddly looking well mannered, but Leftfield character. And here it appears that he's on autopilot.The same can be said for Wilson, who does nothing more than that stupid stoner routine that he's been doing for sixteen years. Sixteen years and he's playing the same character and getting paid big money to do so.This is why you don't see these guys fronting big movies anymore. There routine is tiresome and boring.The best thing about the film is Wiig and the rest of the Ghostbusters, sans McCarthy who really stands out in her otherwise worthless role.It's boring, never really gets a message across, and although Hess is known for his kooky and bizarre characters, this is also becoming tiresome.You'll need a nap after watching this, it's that tiresome.",Masterminds
8,phd_travel,Funny without being crude,8,9 January 2017,I liked this comic take on a true life crime story about a bank heist. There is quite a collection of comic talent here and they are given a chance to shine as various types of white trash. Zach has been quite annoying in some previous movies but here he is the star and he is good. Kristin is good too and prettier than usual. Owen Wilson is always welcome. Jason is fairly funny too.The good part of this comedy is it doesn't rely on excessive crudeness than plagues recent comedies in order to be funny. The story itself is funny and there are quite a few unexpected laugh out loud moments as the action goes from NC to Mexico.Worth a watch.,Masterminds
9,namashi_1,Limited Fun!,5,28 November 2016,"Despite a set of tremendous comedic actors, 'Masterminds' isn't half as funny as it ought to have been. It has some moments, but they aren't enough to pass this delayed release as a winner. 'Masterminds' Synopsis: A guard at an armored car company in the Southern U.S. organizes one of the biggest bank heists in American history. Based on the October 1997 Loomis Fargo robbery.'Masterminds' tries to adapt a crazy true-story into a much crazier film. Sadly, it only engages in bits. I enjoyed the sub-plot of the hero & his crazy girlfriend (Zach Galifianakis & Kate McKinnon), but the main plot doesn't bring out the best laughs. Also, the jokes are too crass & get silly after a point. Chris Bowman, Hubbel Palmer & Emily Spivey's Screenplay is alright. Its only sporadically funny. Jared Hess's Direction is just passable.Performance-Wise: 'Masterminds' rests on the madness of its cast. Zach Galifianakis can be dumb & funny more than anyone else can right now & hence, he's spot-on. Kristen Wiig is irresistible, even though she doesn't much scope. Owen Wilson is okay. Jason Sudeikis is absurd, yet entertaining. Leslie Jones hams. Kate McKinnon is fantastic as Zach's crazy girlfriend & she, completely steals the show.On the whole, 'Masterminds' isn't funny enough. Nonetheless, watch it if you must!",Masterminds
10,Hellmant,"The script might have read a lot funnier, but most of the delivery just doesn't work.",6,5 October 2016,"'MASTERMINDS': Three Stars (Out of Five)A heist comedy based on the actual events of the Loomis Fargo robbery (in 1997, North Carolina). The film was directed by Jared Hess (of 'NAPOLEON DYNAMITE' fame); and it was written by Chris Bowman, Hubbel Palmer and Emily Spivey. It stars Zach Galifianakis, Kristen Wiig, Owen Wilson, Jason Sudeikis, Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones, Mary Elizabeth Ellis, Jon Daly, Devin Ratray and Ken Marino (that includes three-fourths of the new 'GHOSTBUSTERS' cast). The movie bombed at the Box Office, and it got mostly poor reviews from critics. Given all of the talent involved, I found it to be pretty disappointing. David Ghantt (Galifianakis) is an unhappy armored truck driver. He's sick of his job, and about to marry a woman he doesn't love (McKinnon). The only thing that excites him, in his boring life, is his flirtatious coworker Kelly Campbell (Wiig). David has a huge crush on Kelly, and would pretty much do anything she asked him to. So when her, and her criminal friends, ask him to rob the company he works for, David can't say no. The movie is sweet, mildly amusing, and sporadically funny. I love almost all of the actors involved (especially Sudeikis), and their characters are all mostly likable (even the bad guys). I don't think Galifianakis makes a good leading man though, he's much better in supporting roles, and the movie probably would have been better with it's original lead (Jim Carrey). Still, it's not Galifianakis's fault either. Hess is a talented (and very quirky) director, but he missed the mark here. The script might have read a lot funnier, but most of the delivery just doesn't work.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/hx1_SKfiNWs",Masterminds

I always felt I was destined for a life of adventure. It didn't quite pan out that way. Then one day I met Miss Kelly Campbell."" David Ghantt (Galifianakis) works for an armored car company, is engaged to be married and is loving life. He starts to develop a little crush on his co-worker Kelly (Wiig) which results in an opportunity for one of Kelly's friends. David becomes involved in one of the biggest bank heists in US history, with no clue of what he is actually involved in. First of all I have to say that this movie was decent and I laughed a few times, but I was very disappointed. I watched Keeping Up With The Joneses which I thought was very funny, and this one was not nearly as good. The one huge saving grace of this movie was Jason Sudeikis. He saved this movie pretty much by himself. I would watch an entire movie based on that character. The rest of the movie felt a little flat and uninspired and the only thing that really kept me interested, besides Sudeikis, was that it was based on a true story and I wanted to see what actually happened.

14,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,4,2 February 2017,"MastermindsThe easiest way to steal millions is to swipe a lotto winner's oversized novelty cheque.However, the morons in this comedy opted for robbing their workplace.Security guard David Scott Ghantt (Zach Galifianakis) is cajoled into pilfering his armoured vehicle by a co-worker, Kelly Campbell (Kristen Wiig), and her boyfriend, Steve Chambers (Owen Wilson).While David hits Mexico after the heist with minimal cash, Steve squanders millions on a mansion back in America. When the FBI (Leslie Jones) starts sniffing around, Steve sends a hit-man down south to silence David. But fate has other plans.An absurd satire that uses zany Internet humour and ridiculous dialogue to retell the true tale of the ill-fated 1997 Loomis-Fargo robbery, Masterminds makes it difficult to discern fact from wacky fiction.

16,Reno-Rangan,"Man tends to do crazy stuffs for a woman, but stealing $17m is too crazy.",7,14 March 2017,"The film reminded me 'Pain & Gain', only for inspiring from the real and being the comedy flicks. Other than that there's nothing in common between them. I have been expecting a lot from Zack since 'The Hangover', but it was always the near missed opportunities. I'm not saying this was his much needed breakthrough, but quite enjoyable film.An honest man who worked long enough as a guard for a bank, was approached by his ex colleague and her men with an offer. Since he was madly in love with her, he could not say no to it, despite he already got engaged to another woman. As planned the heist goes on and once it was done, he was ditched and ratted out. Now on the run, how he responds to it and the following events decides his fate.Not a great comedy nor a heist film, but it had its moments. The casting was good and it was Zack's show. The rest of them were not into that much, except in the final act. Jason Sudeikis was a bonus. His appearance added more fun. Now I know why Jim Carrey opted out. Owen Wilson's part was not good enough in such a small role, he did good though. Watching it for timepass is fine or even for beyond that seems not a bad try.7/10",Masterminds

18,eddie_baggins,The man behind Napolean Dynamite fails again,4,10 April 2017,"After his cult hit debut with Napoleon Dynamite in 2004, director Jared Hess has failed to recapture the odd brilliance of that film with uneasy comedies in the form of films like Gentleman Broncos and Nacho Libre and while the long talked about and pushed back Masterminds sounded like a film on paper perfectly suited to the filmmaker, this uneven comedy can't maximise the cast or story at its disposal to become a film of note.Based on a bizarre yet true story, Masterminds appears to be tailor made for Hess to unleash some comedy gold, which we get snippets of throughout and when you add to the off-kilter cocktail the likes of a bearded and weirded Zach Galifianakis as our bumbling protagonist David Ghantt, a dumbed down Kristen Wiig, a creepy Owen Wilson and another left of centre turn from the 'it"" girl of comedy at the moment Kate McKinnon, it feels as though Masterminds could've been one of 2016's stand out comedies, in a year in which there wasn't a lot to challenge for the mantle.The main problem that Masterminds runs into is within its tone, as Hess struggles to figure out whether the film is a slapstick comedy, an oddball farce or some form of crime caper combined together with an array of bonkers character creations and it feels as though both filmmaker and cast were unable to unlock just what this 90 minute exercise in frustration, mixed with belly laughs was supposed to be.Another anchor to the films chances of sailing the seas of comedic success is the continued downward spiral of Galifianakis, who ever since breaking out in the first Hangover adventure has become an increasingly disappointing performer.Not far from being a self-parody at most times, Galifianakis's ability to lead a film must surely be in question by now (especially after the failings of Keeping up with the Joneses last year also) and despite him getting the odd moment to shine here, it's really up to the supporting cast to try and gain the films some extra laughs which do come from the likes of Wiig and a small supporting turn from Jason Sudeikis as a dedicated hit-man.A potentially great comedy turned into a merely tolerable one, Masterminds is quite a big letdown upon consideration of its core story and talented cast and it seems as though if Hess can't turn this story into something, he may forever be known as the ""guy"" that made Napoleon Dynamite.2 pairs of braces out of 5",Masterminds

When he was not on the screen, it did not flow like when he was on, and he was always on. He played stupid so brilliantly that he will have you busting a gut uncontrollably. The more dimwitted the funner it got.Proving the It's so funny it's true statement is correct, Galifianakis leads an ensemble cast in a story based on true events about a security guard leading a boring life about to marry the only woman who would have him (Played hilariously by Kate Mckinnon) until his co-worker (Kristen Wiig) used her lady charm to convince him to help her friend (Played Owen Wilson, but not in his best role) rob their employer. Now he's on the run from The FBI (Played by the Hilarious, Leslie Jones), and a hit man hired to keep him from talking (Played by also Hilarious Jason Sudekis).It's a pretty well laid out heist movie, but I got to say, it has so many comic masterminds in it you'd expect that I would laugh so hard, I die of it, but the only real worthy laughs come from Zach Galifinakis, who took the simplistic and turned it into comic gold.

20,jtindahouse,Just not funny enough,4,6 July 2017,"There are two types of comedic actors in the world. There are the ones who can adequately deliver a funny performance provided they are given a great script to work with, and then there are the geniuses who can take any material and make it hilarious regardless. Unfortunately for 'Masterminds' the cast is filled entirely with the former. Also sadly for 'Masterminds' it doesn't have a brilliant script to work with.You might look at the cast on paper and think that looks like a hell of a line-up. But is it really? Zach Galifianakis shot to fame through 'The Hangover' but has failed to achieve anything since. The reason? He's a one-trick pony and he can't pull off any other sort of role. Owen Wilson can be good, but only at playing off someone who is hilarious in the role opposite (think 'Wedding Crashers') and there is no one funny for him to play off in this movie. Kristen Wiig may be well known now for 'Bridesmaids' but was she actually that funny in that movie? As far as I remember almost every laugh I got in that film came from Melissa McCarthy.So the movie isn't funny, but what about the story? Is it interesting enough to carry a film? Not really. It's about as basic as stories come. No intricacy or cleverness is apparent at any stage of the movie and some of the plot points are nothing short of idiotic it has to be said. In fairness it was based on a true story (although I have to suspect some pretty big liberties were taken).I read that Jim Carrey was at one point attached to play the lead role. It's sad that fell through because he is someone who can get blood from a stone. Sadly though it wasn't meant to be and instead this film will forever live in mediocrity.",Masterminds
21,Turfseer,"Ineptitude of low-rent, trailer trash criminals evoke few laughs",4,21 October 2016,"If you told me that Jared Hess, creator of the vastly overrated and loathsome Napoleon Dynamite, would come out 12 years later with Masterminds, a farcical take on the 1997 North Carolina Loomis Armored Car heist, I probably would have been a bit surprised. Unlike Hess' initial effort, Masterminds sports some good acting, a few likable characters (somewhat) and a plot that (very) roughly follows the machinations involved in the commission of the true-life crime.Zach Galifianakis plays David Ghantt, a North Carolina armored truck driver, who falls for co-worker Kelly Campbell (Kristen Wiig). After she quits her job, she falls in with small-time criminal Steve Chambers (Owen Wilson) who concocts a scheme to have Kelly pretend she's in love with Ghantt, and convince him to steal $17 million from his employer.Galifianakis plays Ghantt as a lovesick puppy dog who finally realizes halfway through that Kelly has been playing him. He begins as a completely bumbling crook and the way he makes off with the $17 million goes on for a little too long--and most of it is at best, barely amusing. At least Galifianakis has something to do throughout the film, but Wiig as Kelly spends most of the time on the phone merely trying to keep Ghantt in the dark as to what's going on. Wilson as Chambers attempts to garner laughs living it up in the lap of luxury with his ill-gotten gains. Like Wiig's part, Wilson's machinations are one-note and there are no surprises beyond the initial revelation that he's a low-rent crook.The film's problems reach their apotheosis in the Mexico sequence, where Ghantt is chased by a hit-man, Mike McKinney (Sudekis), hired by Chambers to eliminate the former Loomis employee. The hit-man's malevolent nature crumbles when he erroneously comes to believe that Ghantt is his brother after perusing a fake ID card made up by Chambers. Sudekis' hit-man is too much of a bumbling fool to be funny at all and that pretty much sums up what's wrong with the entire picture.Kate McKinnon stands out as Ghantt's ditsy trailer park trash fiancée, and Leslie Jones manages a few laughs as a beleaguered FBI agent.

22,stevendbeard,Tries Too Hard,6,2 October 2016,"I saw ""Masterminds"", starring Zach Galifianakis-The Hangover movies, Into the Wild; Kristen Wiig-The Martian, The Brothers Solomon; Owen Wilson-Hall Pass, Anaconda and Jason Sudeikis-Mother's Day, Hall Pass.This is a comedy that is based on a true story about the biggest cash robbery in U.S. history. The $17 million robbery took place in October of 1997 in North Carolina. Zach plays the perpetrator of the heist that worked at the Loomis Armored car service. Kristen is a co-worker that puts the idea into Zach's brain, after hatching the plot out with her friend, Owen. Owen plans on using Zach as a fall guy and he uses Kristen to sweeten the deal, making Zach think that she is in love with him. Things don't go according to plan, and Jason, a hit man, is called in to take care of the situation. I did mention that this is a comedy, didn't I? It has it's moments. Sometimes it's funny and sometimes, it seems to try too hard and falls flat. There are a couple of funny/not so funny cameos from Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones-both from Ghostbusters & SNL, just like Kristen-and as the end credits start, there are some bloopers shown, as well as real people from the based-on-a-true story. It's rated ""PG-13"" for crude humor, language, violence and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 34 minutes.

Of course with many heist movies there is some double crossing involved. How will things shake out once the wheels are in motion?

29,bkrauser-81-311064,Stale and Utterly Incompetent,3,3 October 2016,"Welp, it looks like the dunderheads at the now bankrupt Relativity Media LLC. Are hell-bent in giving us yet another doozy before the year's end. What kind of rightfully shelved prattle do they have for us to mull over and regret buying a $10 ticket for this week? A Zach Galifianakis helmed caper comedy about a love-struck loser turned armored truck robber co-starring Kate McKinnon, Kristen Wiig and Owen Wilson? That doesn't seem so bad.Well it gets bad folks, real bad. The kind of bad that gives even the most forgiving audience the urge to check their messages before sneaking into Storks (2016) to ""check on the kids."" Masterminds is an unholy mix of good ideas and concepts made painfully unfunny due bad editing, sloppy storytelling and an over-reliance on the same- old ugly American jokes not funny since Bush was in the White House.The bang adorned Galifianakis plays David Ghantt, a trailer park doofus whose job as an armored car driver fills his head with notions of tense Mexican standoffs and Lee Marvin inspired bravado. His regular partner Kelly (Wiig) passively encourages his flights of fancy, joining him at the shooting range for target practice and openly discussing what she'd do if she was Phillip Johnson; a Loomis Fargo employee that tried to run off with $18 million. Convinced by Kelly's womanly charms and a heist plan masterminded by Kelly's friend Steve Chambers (Wilson), Ghantt decides to follow directives to steal the cash from the Loomis Fargo vault and run off to Mexico for a lovers' rendezvous.On paper, Masterminds has a decent amount going for it. The movie's story attracted quite a few members of SNL's (1975-present) present star lineup including Kate McKinnon as Ghantt's awkward wife, Leslie Jones as the fussy lead FBI investigator and Jason Sudeikis as a frightfully obtuse hit-man. The film is directed by Jared Hess the man responsible for bringing deadpan anti-humor into the mainstream with Napoleon Dynamite (2004)so clap if you're into that. Mix in Galifianakis's personal brand of cringe-antics and Owen Wilson's inference to his character in Bottle Rocket (1996) and you got yourself quite a lot to root for.Unfortunately, this film is much like a foul smelling casserole made with biscuits, Funions and eight-year-old Velvetta; individually each component sounds appetizing enough but clumping all these things together creates a slurry of colon clogging flotsam. The stranger than fiction tale of the Loomis Fargo robbery could have been, should have been a movie about class dispossession. Lacking that, it could have scored some points simply by dialing up the wacky. Yet Hess's inability to graduate his images from weird to laugh-inducing, mutes the good stuff from hitting its frequency. Nowhere is this more clear than when Galifianakis dons bad disguise after bad disguise in order to blend in.Everyone in this film shamelessly acts out their best Joe Dirt (2001) impression, likely enjoying each other's company to the detriment of the audience. In so doing, they come up no funny lines or endeavor to make their characters anything more than poorly defined caricatures. The film then pads the narrative's plot-points to the brink; insuring whatever tiny morsels manage to get a giggle remain few and far between. By the time the robbery takes place (a mire half-hour into the film), all humor has ceased and all opportunities for humor have long choked on the lack of oxygen,In a confounding moment of stupidity, Ghantt fumbles into the back of his armored truck and locks himself in, just as he's getting ready to leave. Seeing Ghantt panic and struggle to breathe at that moment is in many ways the perfect metaphor for this film. Clustered, confused, angry with himself and shambling to find the gears in the next compartment, Ghantt, like the audience feels stuck in a situation that should have never happened. This movie should have never happened.",Masterminds
30,Screen_Blitz,"Among the talented comedic cast, it is sporadically funny and clever at times, but nothing special",6,22 June 2017,"Masterminds is one of those rare comedies that tackles a shocking true story that made national news headlines, and blends it in with goofy PG-13-esque humor. The brain behind this comedic endeavor happens to be no other than Jared Hess, the man behind such comedies like 'Napoleon Dynamite', 'Nacho Libre', and the critically roasted 'Gentlemen Broncos'. So what is the big story? It is the 1997 Loomis Fargo robbery which scored the headlines as to earning the title ""the biggest bank robbery in American history"". It is both a shocking and complex crime committed by wide cast of individuals. Now whether or not this movie succeeds on delivering the laughs and fun of this astonishing lies the big question. Boasting a talented comedic cast, this movie does not fail to spare some good laughs here and there, but sporadically falls flat in other places. The hit-and-miss ratio in the joke department is not too high, but certainly not low enough to make it a comedic bore. Set in 1997, this film follows Dave Ghantt (played by Zach Galifianakis), a 36-year old man working at mundane job as a guardsman for the Loomis Fargo bank. When he is convinced by his crush Kelly (played by Kristin Wiig) to pull an seemingly impossible task of robbing $17,000 in cash, he unexpectedly finds himself double-crossed by one of his accomplices Steve Chambers (played by Owen Wilson) who threatens to turn him in to the FBI. Upon fleeing to Mexico, Dave is faced with a dangerous encounter with a hit-man named Dave McKinney (played by Jason Sudeikis) who Steve hires to kill. There is only so much you can with a comedy picture starring a vast range of actors who each have had their fair share of satisfying comedic endeavors in the past. The most difficult task Jared Hess takes on here is effectively executing its true-story-based plot in a laugh-evoking manner while avoiding the restraints of its complexity. For the most part, he somewhat succeeds. But it doesn't quite make up for the occasional botched attempts at humor, especially when its peddling on butt jokes and slapstick humor. After all, everyone in the cast is only giving much to do with a script that places a limit on their comedic muscles. Boarding the center role is Zach Galifianakis who serves as the driving force of the story. Resorting to his ""guy with an absent mind"" typecast, his character maintains roughly the same level of stupidity as his character Alan from the 'The Hangover' trilogy, only it is less funny here. Of course, he does manage to score just a few good laughs every once a while. But arguably the biggest show stealer is Jason Sudeikis who lands the most laughs out of everyone in the cast. His chemistry with Galifianakis is surprisingly effective, even more than Galifianakis's glamor with Kristin Wiig and Owen Wilson (who is somehow never funny throughout the entire picture). The heist scene which marks the turning plot of the plot is finely executed and provides a good laugh or two. If you go in expecting something of car crashes and shootouts to add to the energy, you will certainly set yourself up for disappointment, although there is one major action sequence late in the film.Masterminds is a sporadically funny caper comedy with just a fair amount of clever and wit, but not enough a worth while picture. There are good attempts at laughs handed from such an appealing comedic cast, particularly Jason Sudeikis. By the end, the film is nothing remarkable nor does hit the high points of any of the cast members' careers.",Masterminds

If the producers thought that was an original twist, it didn't work.

To execute this robbery, Ghantt takes the help of Kelly(Kristen Wiig), Steve(Owen Wilson), Runny(Devin Ratray) & Eric(Ross Kimball). This movie chronicles all the events that take place before, during & after one of the most famous bank heists in American history. Masterminds is a film, that will make you laugh-out-loud constantly. Director Jared Hess has masterfully brought this true story, to the big screen. It's amazing, that this outrageously funny story, happened in real life. Obviously, the makers of the movie, would have exaggerated certain details. One thing I didn't like about the film, is the use of potty humor in some instances. The highlight of the movie, is the cast. This film has some of the best comedic talent in Hollywood. Zach Galifianakis is outstanding as David Ghantt. Galifianakis brings his trademark humor to his character but, also shows the subtle & vulnerable side of Ghantt. Kristen Wiig is brilliant as Kelly. Owen Wilson is great as Steve. Jason Sudeikis is awesome as Mike McKinney. Kate McKinnon is fantastic as Jandice. Leslie Jones is excellent as the Detective.

36,dave-mcclain,more enjoyable than most critics give it credit for,8,4 October 2016,"Stories about stupid criminals are funny. And when those stories are true, besides laughing, we find ourselves shaking our heads in mocking disbelief. Just think about how many times you've read such stories in an Email or heard them on the radio or on TV and how amused you were picturing what was being described. Well, ""Masterminds"" (PG-13, 1:34) brings us a true story of stupid criminals in vivid detail – helped along by some of the funniest actors in movies today – including a few ""Saturday Night Live"" veterans. This ensemble comedically dramatizes the true story of a 1997 North Carolina Loomis Fargo robbery, which remains one of the biggest heists in U.S. history. Although the script by Chris Bowman, Hubbel Palmer and Emily Spivey, along with the direction of Jared Hess (""Napoleon Dynamite"", ""Nacho Libre"") and the comic stylings of the talented cast, adds a significant amount of humor to the action, the film's story and many of its details stick very close to the facts of the case.David Ghantt (Zach Galifianakis) is a clumsy and socially awkward, but basically honest and well-meaning armored car driver in Charlotte, North Carolina. He is engaged to the even more awkward and self-centered trailer park dwelling Jandice (played with a sort of catatonic glee by SNL's Kate McKinnon), but David has fallen for his fellow driver, Kelly Campbell (Kristen Wiig). Kelly lives (also in a mobile home) with an old friend named Steve Chambers (Owen Wilson) and his wife, Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Ellis). When Steve hears on the news about a recent Loomis Fargo robbery, he hatches a scheme to use Kelly's connection to David to get him to rob Charlotte's Loomis Fargo. Kelly is reluctant to play on David's affections, but she'd love to get a share of that money and David is tempted by the promise of a new life with Kelly down in Mexico. After Kelly ""trains"" David for the things that he'll have to do to commit the robbery (and how to possibly ""live off the land"" until it's ""safe"" for Kelly to join him in Mexico), and with the help of a few other down-on-their-luck (and none-too-bright) co-conspirators, the plan is all set.Let the comedic missteps begin! David is a trusted employee with keys to a Loomis Fargo vault, which he accesses after hours. In spite of his natural clumsiness and lack of logical thinking, David somehow manages to load a van with a fortune in bundled bills and gets the vehicle to his fellow criminals waiting outside. They stash the cash, giving David a few thousand dollars (stuffed into his underwear) for his flight to Mexico, where he thinks that he'll soon be reunited with Kelly. Back in North Carolina, an FBI agent (played by SNL's Leslie Jones) knows that David did the deed and she's working hard to piece together the rest of the puzzle. Steve gets nervous and decides to take out a contract on David, hiring an old friend turned hit man, Mike McKinney (Jason Sudeikis) for the job. Mike turns out to be a pretty unhinged hit man and his trip to Mexico in search of David ends up being a comedy of errors. David eventually figures out that he's the patsy and does his best to turn the tables on his partners in crime.""Masterminds"" is a hilarious send-up of that real-life heist from the late 90s. And not all comedies that depict real-life stupid criminals do the job this well. (See 2013's unfunny ""Pain & Gain"". And by ""see"", I mean as an example. Don't actually watch the movie.) This script's enhancements to the true story make for good plotting and make great use of the cast's significant and diverse comedic talents. The humor comes from a combination of the colorful characters' personality traits, Galifianakis' talent for slapstick, some gross-out humor and a lot of good old fashioned stupid criminal mistakes. The movie never oversells its characters or its humor, even actually keeping some moments too low-key. Not all the jokes work, but there are plenty of great sight gags and other laugh-out-loud moments that make this movie exactly what such cinematic experiences are supposed to be – fun.

A bit slow in the first half but the second half quite the opposite.Based on a true story, although I'm sure as with all Hollywood films they change tons of stuff around, especially in this as it is a goofy comedy.Zach Galifianakis is funny in the lead, but surprisingly it's Leslie Jones I found the funniest in a smaller role maybe tied with Jason Sudekis who shows up in the second half... and Kristen Wiig wasn't too bad either.So yeah if you want to watch something silly and like the main cast then yeah why not give it a go.",Masterminds
38,estreet-eva,Not awful,6,6 March 2017,"Certainly, Zach Galifiankis and Kristen Wiig aren't quite as funny as they believe themselves to be and they struggle to carry the underwritten ""Masterminds"" but still, the film is an innocuous curiosity. Telling the real-life story of a David Ghannt who managed to rob the Loomis Fargo armored truck he was responsible for without having formulated any type of plan to avoid detection or to escape. If Ghannt actually anything like Galifiankis' redention of him, he likely was destined for jail the first time someone gave his access to a large amount of cash. Wiig's Kelly was simply the first to manipulate him into doing it. Wiig plays both sides with Kelly portraying her as aggressive and slutty but never doing more than appearing in a sports bra. Luckily Jason Dudekis doesn't appear into well into the film so we are largely spared his contribution. The jokes mainly are represented by a scene used in the trailer where David and Kelly slam into an unmoved security gate in a BMW providing a twist on a thousand similar movie scenes where the gates fly away from the impact. It's not a great joke but it's not awful either. In short, that a good way to sum up the film.",Masterminds

40,LloydBayer,"Despite the combined comic talent, Masterminds isn't nearly as funny as it tries to be.",4,29 September 2016,"There's an unwritten rule when it comes to bratpack comedies – Don't expect much wit. Masterminds has none and that's not even the biggest downside given the combined comic talent in this film.With a lineup comprising of Zach Galifianakis, Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis, it's hard not to recall bratpack comedies like Hall Pass or The Hangover. Those films were not very witty either but they were setup to be outrageously funny and they delivered with laugh-out-loud gags. On the other hand, Masterminds has been in production hell for a long time and was supposed to be released over a year ago. While this doesn't say much about the overall production and budget, it explains why there are as many as six writers for the screenplay. That's never a good sign and it shows – jokes are not only a misfire but the repeated use of toilet humour is a definite indication of lazy writing and poor taste.It is still interesting to note that this film is based on a real life robbery. Details of the heist are almost identical including actual names of the perpetrators, and set in the 90s, this film could have even worked as a Martin Scorsese crime caper. Instead, Galifianakis is in the lead as real criminal David Ghantt but resembling Jim Carrey from Dumb and Dumber. And as expected, his character is as bright as a flickering lightbulb. Orchestrated by Steve (Wilson as the titular perp), the plan is to con Ghantt into stealing money from the armored truck company he works for and have him eliminated in Mexico after the job. Dubbed the 'Loomis Fargo Bank Robbery' by the FBI, the real incident turned out to be one of the largest cash hauls in the United States. What happens in the film is a struggle between staying true to the facts and letting Galifianakis loose.While most of the film barely serves any real laughs (when not being cringe worthy awkward), the only reason to recommend Masterminds would have to be cameos from Sudeikis as a psychotic hit-man and Kate McKinnon as Ghantt's psychotic fiancé. Both are show stealers and with the inclusion of Leslie Jones as a tongue-lashing FBI agent, perhaps the only saving grace in a crime film disguised as a comedy. And speaking of disguise, this film is second to none in imagining what a wanted thief must do to evade airport security. Watch and laugh. Or weep.",Masterminds

I wasn't really sure what to expect considering this was delayed twice and was only in my local movie theaters for 2 weeks at most. My expectations weren't super low, but I was cautious. I figured at most it would be ""meh."" The fact that it did not do well has nothing to do with the quality of the film. I have a feeling in about 20 years or so, it will be a cult classic comedy. I was laughing so hard throughout most of this movie. There were times where I was missing dialougue and trying to pay attention, because I was still laughing at a joke from 2 minutes ago. I can only imagine the conversation the director had to have with the real people of this film, since it is based on a true story. ""I'm going to turn your life story into a comedy, ok?"" That was either incredibly embarassing, or they were cool with it. The film builds up pretty quickly and just gets crazier and crazier, and even more hilarious as it goes on. I wouldn't consider this a ""smart"" comedy, but if you're looking for a way to kill 90 minutes or you're into turn-off-your-brain screwball comedies, you'll probably enjoy this.

A true story told beautifully by director Jared Hess with a top cast from Zach galifianakis (David ghantt) Owen Wilson (Steve) this comedy is hilarious with some true genius comedy gold moments (most of them are involving Jason sudeikis) as a funny yet crazy hit-man.The how and why of the crime are unraveled and underneath all the crime lives a cute blossoming romance.Masterminds is a true gem hidden and well worth watching from the true story to the funniest hit-man ever in Jason sudeikis (Mike McKinney) this is definitely one heist movie you need to watch.,Masterminds
54,writenamehere,Amusing,7,27 July 2021,"You will laugh, at something, and there are a plentiful range of somethings to laugh at. I'm not sure it makes a coherent film, but you will laugh. Who would go into this thinking they were about to see a documentary on the greatest bank heist in America? On the other hand, is it a film? Mostly it seems like a series of comedy sketches riffing on the idea of a bank heist. The cast have a lot of fun fighting each other. They managed to get the clothing of the era exceptionally accurate. How could they not? Most them were there. Watch it for a laugh.",Masterminds

56,jasontheterrible,If you like unpredictable happy endings,8,27 August 2018,"This was shaping up to be a huge disappointment if you know about the true story. It cannot end well for even the most likeable and gullible crooks (e.g., Zach Galifianakis) and that made the early parts irritating. The stupidity of the plotters and subordinates seems over the top, and yet, it actually happened. The surprise is the script is written as black comedy while sticking to the basic plot points. So, if one likes black comedy (making fun of dimwits) then this is loaded with lots of great lines and sight gags. Once I got over myself I was laughing steadily throughout. It is family friendly for the most part and all the stars are superb. When I have a happy ending to look forward to, I tend to relax and enjoy a good comedy film more. So I hope people like me will see it and I wish there were a lot more films like this made. I apologize to the producers, directors and stars for not seeing this in the theater. They actually used real film which made it beautiful to look at. If I had known just some of the above I would have been there several times.",Masterminds
57,KATO-SUBZERO,"Funny movie, Worth the Matinée Ticket price.",9,15 October 2016,"15 October 2016: Masterminds is a good funny movie, once again proving that a comedy movie can be funny without all the hard core profanity cursing in a movie. Greek American actor, Zack Galifianakis is great with all the Abbott & Costello gags. Actress, Kristen Wiig is funny, talented, sexy and cute. Owen Wilson always stands out and does a good comedy performance. The rest of the cast is ho hum boring.This movie is on the comedy movie lines of ""Airplane"", ""Naked Gun"", ""Paul Blart"". All of them are great movies, funny and proof is Not a lot of unnecessary cursing is needed to be a successful movie.For good clean fun that little kids can also watch, I recommend seeing this movie for a good laugh.",Masterminds
58,spmact,Not that bad. Made me laugh enough to make it worth watching.,7,8 January 2017,"If you look at just the cast you'll expect more, but it's still not as bad as many make it out to be. It's a good movie for when you just need a good laugh and you don't need the movie to be sophisticated or deep. Did I think it was a particularly good movie? No. Did it make me laugh out loud? Yes, plenty of times. There are a couple gross out humour moments, but not that many. It's mostly just silly jokes.I wouldn't go to the theatre to see this, but it's a good one to catch on Netflix or something. I don't regret watching it, because I got what I expected out of it: A forgettable movie with a bunch of laughs.The fact that it was based on a true story (though I'm sure they changed a bunch of details) only makes it more interesting.",Masterminds
59,Eric266,Should Have Been Funnier,6,4 June 2018,"Considering all the acting talent involved, this should have been hilarious. It was mildly amusing, mostly due to the over-the-top acting by Kate McKinnon. Zach Galifianakis is David Ghantt, a real life Loomis Armored Car employee who robbed the company of $17.3m in 1997. Galifianakis plays him as a kind of hillbilly rube. Kristen Wiig is an ex-employee who pretends to be sweet on Ghantt to get him to steal the money. Owen Wilson is the leader of the heist. Leslie Jones is an FBI agent investigating the crime. Jason Sudeikis is a hit man sent to kill Ghantt. Finally, Kate McKinnon is Ghantt's crazy girlfriend, Jandice. She steals the show.None of this really holds up to much scrutiny. The plot is silly (albeit based on a true story). None of the actors seems to be taking it seriously and the movie never really picks up steam when it should. It was enjoyable with Sudeikis and McKinnon standing out, but overall this was a wasted opportunity. The film, Logan Lucky, with a similar theme of a heist by a bunch of amateurs is much better.",Masterminds

Watching this movie was quite a relief after having gone seen STORKS recently.The movie is pretty funny and kinda had me in a catatonic awe.I had sorta thought the film was over before Jason Sudukies and The woman from Ghostbusters re release had been introduced as the FBi agent. The film is pretty hick a billy with fantastic performances by the other women involved in the Ghostbusters film also. While Zach Galifinakis plays a simpleton and disciplined Southern lover of both work and women while apparently very uninvolved with criminal elements..he has a crush on a coworker.And hes' already married. So somehow the fantasy of running away from his marriage is implemented while eating at a diner with his coworker, except that Owen Wilson is the husband to that coworker Zach Galifinakis likes a whole lot.

It's a left field comedy, featuring absurd characters-telling a story which is based upon a real life event.The fact that much of the cast are SNL alums, adds to the ease in how they interact with one another. You can tell this would have been a fun set to work on.If you're a fan of any of these comedic actors, you should enjoy this movie.

But it was let down by the fact that everyone was depicted as an idiot, from the main characters, law enforcement- everyone!I was surprised that the likes of Owen Wilson put his name to it. Bank account must be low to be desperate enough to take on such a movie.And this is based on a real life event?

This movie tells the true story of the Oct 4, 1997 Loomis heist. It changes some details to improve the storytelling and comedy, to good effect.Zach Galifianakis is hilarious as the hapless Loomis guard David Ghantt, who falls for his sexy co-employee Kelly Campbell (the equally hilarious Kristen Wiig) and is talked into a heist scheme by her and her flop house friend Steve Chambers, played to perfection by Owen Wilson, although the real Steve Chambers looks hilarious and Owen should have dyed his hair and gone with the stache in this one to portray him.Almost stealing the show is Kate McKinnon as David's terrifyingly hilarious off-the-wall batshitcrazy fiancé. Other SNL fan favorites fill out the cast, but nobody else comes close to the comedy work of Galif, Wiig, McKinnon, and Wilson, all at the top of their game.",Masterminds

The characters aren't believable, the ""comedy"" is superbly cheesy slapstick with a generous serving of crass and gross to boot.This is yet another movie to add to the list of ""how in the world did this get made?"" Why is Hollywood producing this garbage? Is The Producers for real, and the producers of this and other recent movies making money off flops? Because there is no other explanation.",Masterminds
67,michaelant555,Hilarious!,8,20 November 2016,"I loved it! I haven't laughed this much since Due Date with Robert Downey Jr; in fact I laughed even more during this. I read some very negative reviews on here about this and all I can say is that if you don't have a sense of humour for slapstick comedy then don't leave a negative review because of it.An innocent guy working as a security van driver gets talked into robbing the company he works for by an attractive ex-employee that he has a real crush on. He thinks they're going to be living together, happily-ever-after, once all the heat has settled, but things don't quite go to (his) plan.There are so many hilarious moments in this film and the rest is all pretty humorous, as well. It's comedically brilliant, fast paced, intelligently written and an all-round good film. Not a dull moment. Give it a go and DO NOT listen to any (""meh, so-so"") reviews with less than five stars. One reviewer said it's the same kind of humour as Airplane and Naked Gun. It's not!",Masterminds

70,peterwcohen-300-947200,Why not just tell the real story?,2,4 May 2019,"Wow, a swing and a miss! The true story of this robbery has the potential to make a very good movie, and even a funny one. The actual people were not very clever, which has good comic possibilities, but in this movie they're portrayed as drooling morons. Instead we're treated to the cheapest slapstick you can imagine and all kinds of over-the-top character wackiness. If they had done this a straight-forward telling of the robbery, even with this cast, it could have been good and humorous, because of relatable situations. Instead we get increasingly absurd events that don't feel at all real. That kind of slapstick could possiblhy work if it's funny, but it's not.One more thing: Zach has diarrhea in the hotel swimming pool. That's the level of humor we're talking about here. ""Joe Dirt"" is a masterpiece by comparison; at least it's funny.",Masterminds
71,northfacingphotography,It made me laugh,9,10 April 2018,"I don't know if I happen to just have different taste in things, but I can't honestly believe the reviews were as bad as they are. I thought it fit the bill as a comedy. It made me laugh. Comedy is such a subjective thing anyway. There isn't a lot of high-brow humor. That's okay. I loved the ladies in Ghostbusters and they're all here except McCarthy. Zack and Owen are fun also. It didn't make me laugh like The Hangover or Borat, but seriously most ""comedies"" that are targeted for the masses make me want to to stab myself. If you liked NTSF:SD:SUV, Rick and Morty, Children's Hospital or other things along those lines, I think this will do you just fine. I'll take my South Park to whatever canned laughter show any day of the week and this fits that bill.",Masterminds
72,papacorn,To each his own,9,7 October 2016,"I saw the list of cast members and knew this was one I was going to see. Then I read a negative review in a publication and had second thoughts. How often a crew of gifted performers goes to waste with a bad tale. In the end, given the cast, I went. Glad I followed my instincts. The movie is based on an actual event too. If you don't know these people then maybe you'll won't relate to this script. However, these characters are the kind of screw-ups that do exist and their quirks and foibles are perfectly captured in Masterminds. In a time where there is so much to bring us down, a good laugh is golden. Shortly into this one I laughed out loud and was not alone. This is truly an ensemble cast that knows when to be subtle and when to pull out the stops. I think of the photos of customers from a certain discount store that circle the web and can picture them shopping there. And more internet photos come to mind when two of these characters pose for the hokiest of engagement shots. Truth is stranger than fiction and funnier too. A simple, hapless guy with a low paying job, is letting life roll along without any effort to consciously redirect it. Suddenly the prospect of romance, an adventure, and a life changing scheme come along. The scheme is cooked up by a greedy, manipulative stranger who sees a chance for some easy money. How this plot unravels is an enjoyable roller coaster ride to the end. I hope this cast will do another comedy, and soon!",Masterminds

Still most of the humor wasn't that bad and was actually funny.There were some pretty silly scenes and the action pieces weren't really violent as I thought before watching it, as I'm tired of all the violence in movies. But twice I could obviously see they were using dummies in the action shots, which distracts from the movie and shows poor quality.I really like the actors. The lead is Zach Galifianakis; most of his movies are kinda like this one, but my favorite of his was ""It's Kind of a Funny Story"". There's also Kristen Wiig of Saturday Night Live fame and Owen Wilson (from the Fockers & Zoolanders series of movies).Wasn't great, but it can make you laugh.",Masterminds

But from having wasted two hours of my life on this crap. It seemed promising at first with brilliant comedians like Zach Galifianakis and Kristen Wiig, but their talent is completely wasted on a criminally stupid script.Ostensibly based on ""a real story"", but really an imaginary concoction - from the contract killer in Mexico trying to shoot Ghantt with a musket, the capture in a bathtub, the killer finding he has the identical name and deciding not to kill Ghantt, overpowering the Mexican police at the airport, crashing the BMW at the iron gate, wife and mistress fighting at the Walmart, and so on and on. The similarities to what happened in real life and in the movie could be summarized in a few sentences. (But why? The real story wouldn't have needed to be ""improved"".) And this goes even for the general appearance of the main characters. But the final nail in the coffin is that this satire isn't even really funny.I can't believe this was ""based on a true story"".

Zach, Kate McKinnon (his wife), Kristen, and Owen play beyond stupid characters that are totally unrelatable. Leslie Jones is also bad in this movie, but she had one highlight in the movie.

81,hellojaeson,People are Idiots,7,15 October 2016,"Jared Hess (the director) is someone who doesn't believe in the usual comedic mould.His vision of comedy is obscure in that he doesn't want us to laugh at the obvious slapstick.He wants us to cringe a little at the truth behind his laughs.While it's true that in the end comedies need to make us guffaw, chuckle, snicker, titter and chortle; the real art of comedy is to make us feel the pain of our protagonist.I think in this regard, Jared Hess has achieved something rare.A comedic protagonist who is very real and flawed and sad.His sadness makes us laugh because of how bleak his existence is.We feel for him and wish him all the best. I feel that people who don't get this movie are afraid of humanness in others.That's why people are idiots. Because they see comedies as an excuse to simply laugh mindlessly at absurd plot lines. Comedies are also commentaries on the human condition. In spite of being marketed as slapstick, Masterminds is a film about a fragile soul in a dangerous world. Since making such a film a drama would turn away crowds in droves, the film maker re-framed it as something of a tragic comedy.My heart felt for this hero who is at once self-deluded and incredibly sensitive.If you have ever understood unconditional love, you might find something to love in Masterminds too.",Masterminds

Watching this film I felt that it was an insult to my intelligence. Zach Galifianakis's makeup was not realistic and with his southern accent it came across as very false.

To be honest, my expectations were very low , I know I wasn't expecting Leslie Nielsen of naked gun series or Peter Sellers of Pink Panther Series style or even near come on those two were on top of physical comedy. I can say this comedy role in our lives is to make us laugh even if it was a silly laugh and this what Masterminds did, probably it's not piece of cup for the fans of Chaplin,Laurel & Hardie,Jacque Tati,Sellers or Nielsen but when a movie keeps making you laugh out load it's pretty decent even if it lacks artistic part of cinema but sometimes wacky moments in cinema are needed to forget problems of the now and the tomorrow.

Zak G carries this film and the supporting cast were all excellent.There's also a few gross-out moments that give the film a well-balanced comedic palate.I'm surprised it's rated so lowly. This film might not be for everyone, but it's very funny and deserves much more love.Maybe if you're a struggling Marxist it might not be your cup of tea, but if you just want some good ol' laughs I highly recommend it.

These events occurred in King's Mountain, 20 minutes from the town where I grew up in the 90's. So, I can say that the personalities of the locals where slightly exaggerated, though it was the 90's!",Masterminds

103,tappymcwidestance,Just have the right frame of mind,6,12 October 2016,"This is not a great comedy. With only a few exceptions, it is not laugh out loud. If you are expecting The Hangover, you will be disappointed. But, it you want a quirky comedy that remains constantly amusing and can keep a smile on your face, it's not that bad. I enjoyed it and am glad I went.I would have liked to have seen more Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones. Galifianakis talents were wasted. His character could have been played by any dufus. Owen Wilson was fine as was Kristin Wiig. Sudeikis was funny, although his change of heart was not believable. But that's OK because it was needed to move the plot forward.I wouldn't pay full price at the theater (I went on $5 Tuesday) but I would recommend renting it for $2 at Redbox.",Masterminds
104,itisibm,Funniest movie I have seen in years,10,28 November 2016,"I have watched 1000s of movies in recent years. I have not reviewed a single one. I had to review this title. I was shocked that this movie generated a 5.7 average. I have not laughed so hard in ages. It is not a super-smart type of humor, but gets the job done. If you're not super uptight you will love this movie. Truly a gem in the comedy genre as I have stopped watching comedies due to the stupidity of the humor. Here, it's not overdone. While sometimes childish, still executed with taste. Being based on a true story is what initially sold the movie; however, I believe the real heist was just an inspiration for the movie. Therefore, do not expect a true story feel to this movie, just a laugh out loud comedy.",Masterminds
105,frankcaruso,surprisingly stupid,3,30 December 2016,"I am readily able to check my brain at the door for most movies of this ilk. This required a lobotomy that I was not willing to subject myself to. I watched it for about 20 minutes before I shut it down. I remember this story from back in the day. I knew the crooks were stupid but the extent portrayed in this sham was ridiculous! I am Okay with a little embellishment but I cannot believe these people were THAT stupid. The idiotic pratfalls and dialogue were beyond stupid. Who would laugh at these attempts? I would not recommend paying for this, You can stream it but it is still not worth the time. I lost 20 minutes and am thankful I am sick and it wasn't that much of a waste of time!",Masterminds
106,kingstong-79596,I am speechless...,1,9 January 2017,"Did ANY producers read the script before giving it their thumbs up? Was the audience at the test screen high? Were Zach Galifianakis, Owen Wilson, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones and Jason Sudeikis so utterly broke that they had no choice but to do this movie? Who are the scree writers? I don't mean ""who are they"" as in ""what are their names?"". I mean what kind of people write this trash and manage to maintain some semblance of self respect? Please, don't make the mistake I did of watching it. Just say ""no"". Don't even watch the trailer. If You are still reading this, you have wasted too much time on this disaster.",Masterminds

110,wcaputo,"For fans of Almost Heroes, Spy, Bottle Rocket",8,11 January 2017,"I didn't hear a peep about this film all last year. I discovered it while IMDb'ing Keeping Up With The Joneses. This movie should enter the canon along with Bottle Rocket, Spy, The Whole 9 Yards or The Spy Who Knew Too Little. It was goofy but in all the right ways. There is a very brief appearance by Ken Marino. In a way that worked against the film because Ken is so funny and only briefly in the story. Anytime McKinnon is on the screen you will laugh. That is guaranteed, as in any of her films. This one is highly recommended. Surprised of it's current IMDb rating which is what inspired this review.",Masterminds
111,kbralitis,Kind of fun stuff for holidays,7,14 January 2017,"What can I say, the movie was a classic and perfectly normal in an American style. Whole story looks like a few decades ago. The main idea of the film is that the couple is trying to fool the person who will do all the dirty work and stole the money, but they themselves remain white and clean. But as comedies everything happens through humor and when he was stealing, he miss important security facts. But in the end, however, everything ends happily and the main character is a free and rich.The film will not make you laugh to blow out cheeks and get your belly hurt, but will have a good holiday movie to pass the time and have a bit of fun.",Masterminds
112,frank-437-318947,Trademark Hess humor is there...,10,30 September 2016,"Often referenced as ""the director of Napoleon Dynamite and Nacho Libre"" (with no mention of the under-appreciated ""Gentlemen Broncos"" and ""Don Verdean""), Jared Hess never fails to entertain.Even more exciting about ""Masterminds"" was the notice of Hubbel Palmer (Actor, ""Sasquatch Gang"" & actor/director, ""Humble Pie"") as co-writer.The subtle southern colloquialisms stuck out the most to me. A few of these characters would have been folks I grew up around in the south.Characters were all well-acted. I was a little apprehensive about the big-name lineup, but everyone delivered. Zach Galifianakis played a highly-likable and hilariously-caricatured David Ghantt. The folks in our viewing party agreed Jason Sudeikis' hit-man character was a stand-out, and we certainly could've seen more of Kate McKinnon.As far as objectionable content, there is more profanity than normal for a Hess film, BUT it's mild by comparison to most any other PG-13 film. (Handful of h*lls, d*mns, a**, etc.) The jokes may not be crude enough or otherwise too dry / understated for standard audience members to really appreciate. But hopefully it receives enough support to keep Jared Hess and Co. churning out these kinds of films.(Sidenote: Check out ""Austenland"" by Jerusha Hess. Also excellent.)",Masterminds

116,smit-60306,This movie is about a big heist caused by a good worker's love interest.,7,1 November 2016,"Masterminds is about a man that is a long-term worker for a money transferring company at which he meets a girl that he ends up falling in love with. When she is fired then she mixes with the wrong crowd that then invites her to join in on a big heist. She convinces the main character to join them and break into a vault. After the heist, the main character is forced to run from law enforcement in Mexico to eventually return from the US.This movie is a combination of a deep plot and what would be considered ""stupid"" humor in which the jokes are very dumb to the point it is funny. I found this movie to be an overall good movie, however, I would not go see it again for a very long time because most of its jokes are more a one-time joke that would only be funny if you didn't see it coming. This movie, having a comedic aspect to it, forced me to decide to take a look at how humorous the movie actually was. There are quite a few memorable moments throughout the movie that stick in your mind as a funny moment that replays in your head later on to make you chuckle to yourself. A majority of the comedy contained in this movie is cringy jokes, however. This aspect makes it a movie that should be seen only every once in a while because it could get old quickly if you watch it multiple times in close ordinance to each other. When it comes to movies then I like to look at how family friendly the movie would be for those parents that have their kids begging to take them to see it. The first thing I look out for is how bad the language in the movie is. Many parents don't want their children to sit there and repeat a bunch of cuss words they heard from a movie. This brings me to the point of how bad the language in the movie was. This movie does not use near as many cuss words as many other movies do, however, it does use quite a few cuss words that make this movie not as suitable for younger audiences to watch. This movie alongside the cuss words also asked some offensive language that is not appropriate for a family to see especially if the children don't know any better than whether or not to repeat what is said. Now something that most people just get sick at the thought of is gruesome gore scenes. Something that makes this movie better is the face that there isn't a whole lot of gore. This movie does a good job of coming up with intense action scenes that allow you to enjoy the cool aspect of an action movie that has a twist of humor to make it funny. Every one of these never contains a whole lot of gore, though. This is a great aspect to have in a movie that is trying to accomplish what this one did. Good Things about this movie  Constant action  Fun humor  A love interest  A good combination of action and comedy Bad Things About This Movie  Bad language  Inappropriate themes  Graphic content",Masterminds
117,chrisreddersen,"Masterminds, A Comical Masterpiece?",7,29 March 2017,"Masterminds, a comical masterpiece?With an all-star cast, and a movie script so bizarre it must be true—yes, this is a true story—I expected to be thoroughly entertained, and I was not let down. ""Masterminds"" is a breath of fresh air that showcases the awkwardly funny talents of Zach Galifinakis, Kirstin Wiig, and Owen Wilson.The movie centers itself around one of the largest heists in history, orchestrated by a Man named Steve (Wilson) and carried out by a Man named David Ghantt (Galifianakis) who did it all for his crush on a co-worker, Kelly (Wiig). These are a bunch of blue-collar, uneducated group of people, looking for something better. Kelly soon realizes Ghantt has a crush on her and uses this knowledge to get close to Ghantt, in order to convince him to steal the money. At one point, they go to the gun range to discuss what they would do with a million dollars, and Ghantt has an accidental discharge of his weapon while trying to holster it in the rear of his waistband. Kelly then exclaims: ""Oh my gosh! David, let me see! That bullet just went straight between your cheeks!"" It was an unlikely heist, perpetrated by an even more unlikely group of individuals.All in all, the movie was light hearted, didn't take itself too seriously and made me laugh all the way through. Overall I give this movie an A. It is entertaining as it is unbelievable. The movie is now on video and would make an excellent add for your collection.",Masterminds
118,mddarley,Zach Galifianakis and other cast members were awesome,8,20 June 2017,"I watched this not knowing what to expect and found myself laughing a lot and enjoying it thoroughly. I was surprised to see that it was not better received (not too surprised though, as it seems only the most popular movies get any positive reviews and there tends to be a bandwagon effect). Based on true story of one of the largest cash heists in history, it follows the crazy story of its perpetrators and their attempts to avoid being caught. Zach Galifianakis and other cast members are hilarious. The makers of the film obviously took pains to add little details to every scene that really add to the comedy. In the beginning, for example, there is a scene of awkwardfamilyphotos.com style engagement photos that is so great. Plot twists as the film progressed to its conclusion kept the story interesting. There were some parts that were hard to buy, but it was a comedy after all. It's on Netflix currently.",Masterminds
