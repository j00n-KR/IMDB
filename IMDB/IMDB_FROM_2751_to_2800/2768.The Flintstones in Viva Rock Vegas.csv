0,MartinHafer,Why all the hate towards this film?!,6,1 August 2018,"When both Flintstone movies came out, my daughter wanted to see them, so we did. I was not especially impressed by the films...but I thought they weren't bad. Well, apparently I am not the typical viewer, as both films (especially ""Viva Rock Vegas"") have very low scores on IMDB...and ""Viva Rock Vegas"" now made the Bottom 100 list following the recent changes to this list (increasing the minimum number of votes greatly impacted the list....and about 2/3 of the films are new to the list). Because of this change, I decided to try seeing the film again....and perhaps I was mistaken the first time.The first thing you'll notice is that although the look of the film is great (much like the first film), all the principal actors are different. Apparently, the studio had a hard time getting the old actors to commit to the film...so to try to get around this, the movie is supposed to be a prequel which occurred long before the Spielberg film.When the story begins, Gazoo is being punished for some unknown mistakes. His punishment is to be banished to Earth to observe human mating rituals. Not surprisingly, he picks Fred and Barney to follow...as the boys have not yet met Betty and Wilma. Once they do, they all fall in love but it doesn't go THAT smoothly. First, Wilma comes from a rich and snooty family...and they have no interest in low-brow Fred. Second, Wilma's old boyfriend invites the four of them to Rock Vegas....and he obviously has some underhanded scheme in mind for them. Third, once in Rock Vegas, Betty mistakenly thinks Barney is chasing another woman and she ends up being one of Mick Jagged's entourage.So was I wrong the first time? I don't think so. While the film isn't exactly brilliant, it is what it is supposed to be...a live action version of a cartoon...no more, no less. And, despite me not seeing it with my daughter this time, I had a fine time watching the film. Pleasant and adequate...and not at all deserving all the hate it's received. Believe me...there are many, many, many worse kids films, such as ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"", ""Baby Geniuses"" (1 and 2), ""Son of the Mask"" and most of the ""Land Before Time"" films (they made 14 of them!!!). Don't be afraid to buck conventional wisdom, as I think this film is enjoyable and a decent story to watch with your kids.",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Better than expected prequel, and a decent movie",6,18 November 2009,"I came on here to review this movie, and I was really surprised at the rating. I didn't think the movie was that bad. It is flawed in a lot of ways, but there is some fun embedded in the film. I am stuck on whether it is better than the 1994 movie or inferior. If I were to be picky, I would say better in some areas, inferior in others. My main flaws were with the script and some of the plot. The script is weak in places, but has some funny moments, mainly with the little green alien. The plot I think is stronger than the one in the 1994 movie, but slower in pace and does suffer from one or two hasty and over-familiar subplots like Chip stealing Wilma's necklace and framing Fred. I liked it though that it detailed of how Fred and Wilma met, and the scene at the bowling area was sweet with the Nutcracker serving as background music. Mark Addy looks more the part of Fred than John Goodman, but I felt that he slightly underplayed, and I did find Stephen Baldwin too tall and too gormless as Barney. However, Kristen Johnson is wonderfully voluptuous as Wilma and Jane Krakowski, what can I say, better than Rosie O'Donnell. As much as I like O'Donnell, she wasn't quite right for Betty in the 1994 film, Krakowski was perfect. In terms of supporting actors, Alan Cumming is amusing as Mick Jagged and even better as Gazoo and Joan Collins is a sheer delight as Pearl. Thomas Gibson has his moments as Chip. The soundtrack is great, and the scenery, costumes and design of Dino were spot on. Plus that little alien is cute, and the dance routine at the end was lots of fun. All in all, has its flaws but it's a fun prequel. 6/10 Bethany Cox",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
2,jboothmillard,The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas,4,15 April 2008,"This prequel to the live action film based on the popular Hanna-Barbera cartoon sitcom is just as cheesy and ridiculous, and yet it does have slightly more to offer, from the same director Brian Levant (Beethoven, Jingle All The Way). Basically The Great Gazoo (Alan Cumming) has come to Earth to see how humans (or should that be Neanderthals) mate, in his case, Fred Flintstone (A Knight's Tale's Mark Addy) and Barney Rubble (Stephen Baldwin). Soon enough Fred and Barney meet and fall in love with Wilma Slaghoople (Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me's Kristen Johnston) and Betty O'Shale (30 Rock's Jane Krakowski). Betty and Barney suit each other perfectly, but Wilma's mother Pearl (Joan Collins) is not impressed with Fred, she wants Wilma to marry rich bastard Chip Rockefeller (Thomas Gibson). Chip obviously plans to make Fred and Barney look like criminals by giving them some credit to gamble in Viva Rock Vegas, they obviously see the opportunity to make money to impress their girlfriends. In the end, Chip is obviously defeated, and Fred and Wilma marry, with Betty catching the flowers, oh, and Gazoo (who only Fred and Barney could see) succeeded in his ""mission"". Also starring Cumming as Mick Jagged, Harvey Korman as Colonel Slaghoople, American Pie's John Cho as Parking Valet, The Mask's Jim Doughan as Dinosaur Confessor and Rosie O'Donnell as the voice of the Octopus Masseuse. Addy does quite well replacing John Goodman, Baldwin is certainly stupider than Rick Moranis was, Johnston is more voluptuous and husky voiced than Elizabeth Perkins and Krakowski is definitely better than O'Donnell, all in all, a near better film than the first. Okay!",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
3,Quinoa1984,What was I thinking?,1,14 December 2000,"I just saw this movie again on tv, and I realized, hmm maybe it does suck. Of course I could be wrong (I gave it props in the original review), but I think not.  This is a film that repulsed me, and keep in mind this is a prequel, to a film that was a remake of the tv show based on the classic honeymooners, and that type of chain can create foulness as I now realize.The so called plot follows Fred and Barney, younger here, search for love and find it in Wilma and Betty and of course the rest is ancient (and not too good) history.  Not even the great gazoo can bring this film from the muck that it is.  D-",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
4,BandSAboutMovies,Yabba Dabba Poo,2,26 May 2020,"Did you like the cast of The Flintstones movie? Bad news. None of them are back.Mark Addy replaces John Goodman as Fred. Stephen Baldwin is no Rick Moranis as Barney. Kristen Johnston takes over for Elizabeth Perkins as Wilma Slaghoople. Jane Krakowski is here instead of Rosie O'Donnell as Betty.The 2000's were a time of prequels. So if you ever wanted to know how the Flintstones got together - and you desired to see the character that ruined the original show, The Great Gazoo (Alan Cumming, who also plays Mick Jagged, the Mick Jagger character ) - it's all here for you.This was directed by Brian Levant, who was also behind the first film, as well as Problem Child 2, Beethoven, Jingle All the Way, the direct to video sequel to A Christmas Story and supposedly the reboot of Police Academy.Look, I'll watch any movie with Joan Collins in it. That was pretty much what kept me going in this film. Harvey Korman shows up, which is ironic, as he was the voice of Gazoo in the original cartoon. And hey, Taylor Negron roles are always appreciated.At least they kept Mel Blanc's voice for Dino.",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
5,studioAT,Why a prequel?,2,31 July 2015,"The first Flintstone film was enough of a hit to warrant a second attempt and oddly the powers that be opted for a prequel rather than a sequel.The big problem that this then creates is that there is little or no drama to be had in this film because we all know perfectly well that Fred and Wilma will end up together.Quite where the martian coming to earth to learn about courting came from I don't know, but it adds very little to the film.All that remains then is a film that feels like a straight to DVD attempt and although Mark Addy and especially Kirsten Johnston do their best, this film is pretty pointless.",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas

7,anaconda-40658,About as Stupid as Viva Las Vegas.,2,3 June 2015,"The Flintstones: Viva Rock Vegas (2000): Dir: Brian Levant / Cast: Mark Addy, Stephen Baldwin, Kristen Johnson, Jane Krakowski, Joan Collins: No improvement over the over hyped original disappointment. The subtitle is corny given that it is a reminder of that horrible Elvis Presley film. Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble become employed at the rock quarry then they meet the embarrassing Great Gazoo. Wilma is trying to shed her rich image so she flees and is befriended by Betty who works at a restaurant. Absolutely no plot with elements such as courting, gambling and jail that is above the intended audience. Horrible directing by Brian Levant who also made the first film. What does work is the casting is more accurate. Mark Addy is effective as Fred and Stephen Baldwin brings out the mannerisms of Barney. We are given their introductory to their jobs and their first encounters with their future wives, which leads to a predictable outcome. Kristen Johnson brings fine comic touches to Wilma who rebels against her rich upbringing and is accepted by working class Betty who is played by Jane Krakowski. Joan Collins plays Wilma's mother and Fred's antagonizing mother-in-law. While the film delivers on a narrative given background setup to characters, the special effects are actually worse with Gazoo in desperate need to disappear. Score: 2 / 10",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
8,Wuchakk,A prequel to the first movie with a different cast and almost as good,8,13 June 2015,"While critics love to bash the two live-action versions of ""The Flintstones"" and the ratings at IMDb are surprisingly low, the first film was a huge hit in 1994 and fittingly so because it's a great movie for what it is. The second one came out six years later in 2000 and features a different cast, which is appropriate since the story is a prequel, taking place when the four main characters are in their late teens or early twenties and romance blossoms between the couples.Although Mark Addy as Fred isn't as good as John Goodman, he's a more-than-acceptable substitute and, besides, Fred is much younger here so it's fitting. Stephen Baldwin is even better (slightly) than Rick Moranis as Barney. Jane Krakowski is also better than Rosie O'Donnell as Betty, not to mention one of the most beautiful women to walk the planet. As for Wilma, Kristen Johnston isn't technically as good as Elizabeth Perkins because the latter had Wilma's 'look' to a ""T"" and Johnston is noticeably too tall, but she makes up for it with her goofy charisma that can't be beat. Lastly, who better to replace Elizabeth Taylor as Fred's stepmother than Joan Collins? Both Flintstones movies are easy prey to incessant panning because they're based on a 60's cartoon. So freaking what? The question is, do they work for what they are and the answer is a resounding ""yes""! Movies must be critiqued and graded according to what they are and aspire to achieve, not according to what they aren't. For instance, ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"" is a goofy comedy and should be reviewed on that level. Compared to the original ""Apocalypse Now"" it's a throwaway flick, but how does it stack-up to other silly comedies? It's the same thing with both Flintstones movies – how do they stack up to other live-action versions of cartoons? Are they amusing? I always loved Gazoo and he's effectively brought to life in ""Viva Rock Vegas."" The sets and F/X are top-of-the line and hold up to this day. Being a prequel, it's natural to think that the producers lowered the budget, but this wasn't the case at all. The original cost $45 million while this one cost a whopping $83 million; but, while the first film raked in $360 million worldwide, this one only made $60 million.Like the first movie, the story has warmth and offers realistic and worthy themes. Take, for instance, Fred and Barney's bond. They're best friends and their personalities balance each other out. You'll see this in real life. My best friend, for example, is similar in some ways to Barney while I more fit the Fred role.The first two acts of ""Viva Rock Vegas"" are just as entertaining as the previous film, but there aren't as many laughs in the third act as the plot busily ties things up. Don't get me wrong, the third act is eventful and amusing, but there simply aren't as many laughs as the first two acts. Nevertheless, ""The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas"" is entertaining from beginning to end as a live-action cinematic rendition of the cartoon and wisely doesn't overstay its welcome at 91 minutes.The film was shot at Vasquez Rocks, Santa Clarita and Parmount Ranch, Agoura, California, and Page, Arizona.GRADE: A-",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
9,MovieAddict2016,Truly Awful...I Had a Hard Time Watching it...,2,3 April 2003,"""The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas"" is one of the poorest excuses for a family film I've seen in a long time.The original remake with John Goodman was at least decent, but this flop has not only an awful cast, but awful dialogue, filming techniques, jokes...it's straight out of a made-for-TV sequel. Only one thing: It's even worse.In this live-action prequel to the 1994 comedy hit, Fred Flintstone (Mark Addy) and wife Wilma (Kristen Johnston) go to Rock Vegas along with the Rubbles, Barney (Stephen Baldwin) and Betty (Jane Krakowski), where Wilma is pursued by playboy Chip Rockefeller (Thomas Gibson). This is the setup for a bunch of tiring gags that also have to do with a little green space alien coming to earth to see how humans mate, or something as such.This has to be one of the worst comedies I've seen it a while. It was actually painful for me to watch. There really are no redeeming values whatsoever, and I don't think I'd like it even if I was a five-year-old. It treats the audience like dirt, and it obviously seeing if there's any juice left in the audience to pay for another ""Flintstone"" flick.Instead of trying to improve upon the first film--which was a bit underrated--this film seems to go for the bare minimum in an effort only to draw money from the audience. I have to ask myself, if they knew the first was so critically-declaimed, why release another awful flick? Try to improve and get good reviews.But nope, no luck here. Instead we are treated to a truly awful and hard-to-watch comedy with no redeeming values whatsoever.Avoid at all costs.0.5/5 stars--John Ulmer",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
10,richardchatten,Lively Prequel,6,28 December 2019,"Since most Hollywood 'family' films look like cartoons anyway these days this prequel to 'The Flintstones' (which wasn't much cop in the first place) with its saturated colours and hyperactive performances passes the time pleasantly enough (although the addition of a 'funny' little green alien played by Alan Cumming smacks of desperation).Mark Addy struggles gamely with an American accent, while Kristen Johnston is as usual charmingly ungainly costumed as Wilma; and it's fun to see Harvey Korman and Joan Collins as her parents whose daughter has married beneath herself.",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
11,lesleyharris30,"I don't care what anyone else says,I think this is better than the first live action Flinstones movie.",7,9 June 2010,"The Flinstones in Viva Rock Vegas is a good movie and in my opinion I think it is better than the first live action Flinstones film in 1994,altough it is definitely not better than the original Flinstone cartoon in the 1960s.Its about Kazoo getting sent down to Earth to help Fred Flinstone and Barney Rubble with relationships and they eventually meet Wilma and Betty and in this Wilmas family is wealthy and a guy thats trying to win Wilmas heart invites the four of them to Viva Rock Vegas.But it turns out to be a big mistake where Fred loses all his money from gambling,Betty thinks that Barney was cheating on her and Fred gets framed for robbing Wilmas pearls.The Flinstones in Viva Rock Vegas is better than the first live action Flinstones but not as good as the cartoon,you'll have a gay old time.**** 4/5 stars",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
12,filipemanuelneto,A movie that isn't worth the price of DVD's plastic.,1,22 July 2017,"I always liked the ""Flintstones"" cartoon and I was able to appreciate some aspects of the 1994 live-action movie. However, this movie was a disgrace in every details. Running as a prequel to the first film and the cartoon itself, it shows how the four main characters (Flintstones and Rubbles) met and married, after a trip to the city of Rock Vegas (the equivalent, in the movie and Flintstones world, to the city of Las Vegas, of course). But the thing that really make me mad in this movie, personally, was that silly, green character, that seems to have come out of the ""Jetsons"" (another Hanna-Barbera cartoon). He was permanently out of context, his existence has been poorly explained by the plot and he only served to try to make totally empty jokes. I wanted to drown that alien several times while watching the movie.If the 1994 movie had already revealed several fragilities, beginning with an all-too-adult plot for a children-oriented film, this movie completely misses any attempt to improve these faults. The plot is miserably poor, which is probably the result of poor scriptwriting choices and the subliminal, lousy, intention of extorting some more box office money (we cannot forget the huge box-office success that the first film was). A bad choice: the public wisely didn't pay to watch this piece of trash. Dried jokes, a bad plot, poor acting, bad construction of characters, far-fetched props and sets, a tiring cinematography and a cast that did an absolutely painstaking job. For all this, this is one of the worst family movies I've ever seen.",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
13,matthewssilverhammer,Yabba Dabba Bad,4,3 August 2020,"The design is still impressive, and the story is much more in the vein of the show...but this new casting is embarrassing. The four leads look like they're being held hostage; it's never a good sign when Stephen Baldwin is the standout. Rosie O'Donnell returns, but doesn't get to reprise her solid performance as Betty. And why did Hollywood put all their chips on Alan Cumming at the turn of the century? No one won from that bet...including Cumming.",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
14,TOMNEL,"An insult to the series, and even the original movie.",3,10 February 2008,"""Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas"" is a downright stupid movie. The sets in the first film made it very fun to watch. This has some cool looking sets, but relies too much on bad computer animation. Of course, that's not the worst part. Everything else is quite bad too.Fred Flintstone (Mark Addy) and Barney Rubble (Stephen Baldwin) have met the girls of their dreams, Wilma (Kristin Johnston) and Betty (Jane Krakowski). This movie sets up a stupid back story for Wilma as a rich girl, and features a very annoying character. Remember the Great Gazoo? He's the little annoying alien that was added as a character when the show was almost over in it's last season. The introduction of this character in the show was it's final desperation to not be canceled. So why did they figure Gazoo would be a good idea for the movie? I have no idea, but it wasn't. The acting is OK, at least Betty Rubble was played by somebody who fit her in this one, unlike the first film. So, other than a few cool sets, this is an easy movie to skip.My rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 85 mins. PG for mild language.",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
15,MartianOctocretr5,Fossilized dino deposits,3,11 September 2006,"This movie makes an awkward attempt to stay faithful to the spirit of the cartoon. It has moments, but far too few of them.The few things done right first: Jane Krakowski makes a wonderful Betty; why couldn't she have been in the first movie? She makes the silly dialog somehow sweet and fun. The dating sequence is cute and the Vegas arrival scene has some clever sight gags, but these were fleeting montages. Harvey Korman is wasted in a throw-away role with few lines; instead of voicing Gazoo (as he did in the original cartoon), and the guy they use for Gazoo sounds like slate grinding on bedrock.Joan Collins is obnoxious enough on her own; this movie has her play a wrenching stereotypical loudmouth mother-in-law who you want to feed to the nearest T-Rex you can find. And the guy that plays Barney? What the heck is he doing? His entire performance looked like a rejected audition for a junior high school production of ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure in Jurassic Park."" Fred? The guy had a voice almost as nasally as Joan Collins. Wilma is cast as a 7-foot-tall giraffe. Fred goes gambling: Gee, what's gonna happen there? Fred and Barney dress up as dancers: they even manage to ruin this classic comedy routine. A poorly done triangle story falls flat.This petrified fossil of a film does little justice to the Modern Stone-Aged Family. Rent some of the original cartoons, instead.",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
16,Victor Field,"Spare us ""Yogi Bear: The Movie."" Please.",4,31 March 2002,"""The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas"" is actually slightly more bearable than the truly horrible 1994 movie, but that really isn't saying much. Where the previous one suffered from chronically bad casting for the Flintstones and the Rubbles (except for Elizabeth Perkins as Wilma), this benefits from Stephen Baldwin and Jane ""Best reason to watch 'Ally McBeal' not called Lucy Liu"" Krakowski making a far less annoying Barney and Betty than Rick Moranis and Rosie O'Donnell (the latter the only major cast member to return here, in voice mode only). The movie also has a few nice little touches like pictures of the cartoon Fred and Barney handed out to people, and the specially modified Universal logo with the Earth only showing one continent behind the word ""Univershell"" (""Did anyone else see those giant letters out there?"").Alan Cumming as the Great Gazoo (and a Mick Jagger-type rock star) is also one of the movie's pros... and indicative of its cons. Writers Deborah Kaplan & Harry Elfont (""Can't Hardly Wait,"" ""Josie and the Pussycats"") and the late Jim Cash & Jack Epps, Jr (""Top Gun,"" ""Anaconda"") go for too many cheap gags, have a wilful disregard for the show's mythology - Gazoo didn't arrive until Fred and Barney were both married with children, for starters (and as another poster rightly says, he crashlanded as opposed to being sent) - and don't really have much of a plot going for them. The movie's all as silly as that episode where the boys befriended ""Ann-Margrock"" without knowing who she was. Speaking of which, Ann-Margret (who guested on the TV show) returns to Bedrock to sing ""Viva Rock Vegas"" in a montage and over the credits, but her take isn't a patch on the BC-52's version of the theme song in the first one, and indeed the overall feeling of going down a level is everywhere - not just in the plot of Wilma's mum wanting her daughter (a miscast Kristen Johnston) to marry an uppercrust type (Thomas Gibson from ""Dharma & Greg""), but from the cast to the visual effects (Rhythm & Hues aren't quite up to Industrial Light & Magic's level) to the music (song-wise, that is; David Newman at least tries), the movie fits in all too well alongside the other losers directed by Brian Levant, he of ""Problem Child"" and ""Jingle All The Way"" infamy. And I still think James Belushi, not John Goodman or Mark Addy, IS Fred Flintstone.At least the first one had Halle Berry and some puns in the credits (though this does have Jane Krakowski - hubba hubba). And no Joan Collins...",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
17,Beta_Gallinger,Even weaker than the mediocre 1994 movie,4,26 September 2010,"I saw the 1994 live action ""Flintstones"" movie on video for the second time in 2000, about 4 ½ years after I first saw it, and thought it was great during my second viewing. That was shortly after this prequel, featuring a different cast, came to the silver screen, and I remember hearing about this film around that time. Since I was not nearly as impressed during my last couple viewings of 1994's ""The Flintstones"" (both many years after my second), I was in no hurry to see ""The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas"", especially since I knew it had an even worse reputation than its predecessor. It's been over 2 ½ years since I last saw the first live action ""Flintstones"" effort, and I've finally seen this second one, which is unsurprisingly not good.The Great Gazoo is an alien who is sent to Earth by his species to learn about human mating rituals. Back on Earth, in the prehistoric town of Bedrock, Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble are two best friends who are both in search of girlfriends. They are the first ones Gazoo sees after he lands on the planet, so he decides to follow them around, even though he annoys them. Meanwhile, a rich young woman named Wilma Slaghoople is fed up with the snobbish people around her, especially her mother, and runs away. She goes to a restaurant and meets a waitress named Betty O'Shale, and they quickly become friends. Fred and Barney go to this restaurant and meet the two women. Fred gets a date with Betty and Barney gets one with Wilma. When the four of them go out together, Fred and Barney end up swapping girlfriends, but both of them are successful with their romance. Both couples are invited by Chip Rockefeller, Wilma's rich and arrogant ex-boyfriend, to his resort in Rock Vegas, but what they don't realize is that this is just a cruel scheme for Chip to win Wilma back! The main problem with the 1994 film is that it simply isn't funny, and that's most certainly a major issue with this prequel as well. The only part of this film I couldn't keep a straight face while watching was the ""I'm ignoring you"" part. There's one memorably lame moment with a farting dinosaur, and most of the other gags are just mediocre. I was also not impressed with many of the performances here. Mark Addy may not be bad as Fred, and I guess Stephen Baldwin isn't that bad as Barney, though I definitely preferred Rick Moranis' portrayal of the character in the first film. These performances certainly aren't great, however, and I certainly didn't care for Kristen Johnston and Jane Krakowski as Wilma and Betty respectively. Also, Alan Cumming plays two characters, which are Gazoo and Mick Jagged (obviously based on real-life Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger), and both his performances fail, especially the former, I would say. At the beginning, showing Gazoo with other members of his species on a spaceship before he is sent to Earth, it already looks like this is going to be a very unfunny comedy movie, and unfortunately, that beginning sequence doesn't lie.The first live action film adaptation of ""The Flintstones"" was a critical failure but a box office success, whereas ""The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas"" was both a critical AND box office flop. After watching it, that doesn't surprise me. I can't really think of anything wrong with the 1994 release other than the absence of laughs, but I would say that REALLY brings it down if quality, since it is supposed to be a comedy. Just like its predecessor, this prequel failed to make me laugh even one time, but this second film of the two also has inferior cast performances, and maybe a slightly more boring plot as well (I'm not 100% sure about that, as it's been a while since I last watched the first film), which makes it even worse. I only found it a BIT worse than the 1994 film, and don't absolutely hate it like many others clearly do, but some could find it a LOT worse, including some of those who like the first film. If you don't like 1994's ""The Flintstones"", you probably wouldn't like this prequel. If you do like that movie, there's probably STILL a good chance you wouldn't like ""Viva Rock Vegas"".",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
18,bellino-angelo2014,"Unfairly hated, just like the first one",6,28 April 2021,"Since I grew up as a child in the 2000s I saw almost all the good movies based on classic cartoons (such as the GARFIELD ones, the SCOOBY DOO ones and of course THE FLINTSTONES ones). I must have seen the FLINTSTONES movies at least 3 times during my childhood and when I looked about them on IMDB I was shocked at their appalling scores (and this one has also made the new Bottom 100 at #87 at the moment as in 2018 the Bottom 100 changed the criteria for including movies in its list, so increasing the number of votes up to 10,000 for being eligible greatly impacted the list, and almost all of the movies in it are from the last 21 years.This film isn't really a sequel of the movie with John Goodman and Rick Moranis as apparently the studio had an hard time in calling back the actors for the previous movie so, for getting around this, this is a prequel about what happened before the events of the 1994 movie hit.In the beginning the alien Gazoo (Alan Cumming) is banished from his planet for some unknown mistakes and he has to go to Earth to follow the humans' mating rituals. Quite coincidentally, he picks as his subjects Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble (played this time by Mark Addy and Stephen Baldwin) as they are freshly graduated and began to work in the quarry. After a while they meet Wilma Slaghoople and Betty Rubble (played this time by Kristen Johnston and Jane Krakowski) and they fall in love and they go on Rock Vegas, but soon trouble follows; Wilma comes from a rich and spoiled family and they are not really interested in low brow Fred; her former boyfriend Chip Rockfeller has a scheme for them when they go to the casino; after some misunderstanding Betty ends up in Mick Jagged's tour.So it really deserves its bad score and reviews? I don't think so. While the movie isn't a masterpiece it's good in what it is... a live action version of a cartoon. And despite having a different cast and a different story, I enjoyed it on the same level of the predecessor. It has the same colorful sets and funny looking dinosaurs and prehistoric animals from the first movie. The cast has improved a little bit; while Stephen Baldwin was a bit better than Rick Moranis in the first one as Moranis was less clueless, I prefer John Goodman over Mark Addy as Fred Flintstone. While Kristen Johnston is gorgeous just like Elizabeth Perkins (and even a bit taller), I think that Jane Krakowski was a cuter choice for Betty Rubble as she is less fat than Rosie O'Donnell. Thomas Gibson as the villain looked a LOT like Kyle MacLachlan for me.In substance, I'll simply suggest to don't be afraid to buck conventional wisdom, as this is a very cute and harmless family movie that can be enjoyed by both adults and children.",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas

20,bigverybadtom,Actually Better Than The Original,4,24 November 2012,"But then I wasn't too impressed with the original. The entire cast is new, and they actually seem to fit the movie better. Also, this film has a much more developed storyline and actually deals with the origins of the two main families.Wilma runs away from her snobby rich family and her associates, and winds up in a diner meeting Betty, a waitress working there. Shortly after, they meet Fred and Barney, and during their double date, Fred is with Betty and Barney is with Wilma, but shortly afterward the couples switch partners. Also, Gazoo the alien appears to them, doing a study of human mating rituals, and he tags along with them, though he is an annoyance to Fred and the others.But the casino they patronize is run by a ex-boyfriend of Wilma's who wants to marry Wilma-not for love, but for access to her family's money.

21,Movie-12,One of the most horrible comedies in years. 1/2* out of ****.,1,22 May 2000,"THE FLINTSTONES IN VIVA ROCK VEGAS / (2000) 1/2*""The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas"" reminds me of edible substances that have no taste, no texture, no nutrition, but are very colorful and you can chew on them. This movie has no depth, no purpose, no meaning, but it has prehistoric set creations, big sound effects, imaginative costume designs, and colorful makeup contributions-all of which may capture the attention of the film's target age group. This contraption absent of intelligence, flavor, and just about everything else.This immature prequel to the 1994 comedy hit based on the popular TV cartoon series, ""The Flintstones,"" is so bad none of the previous performers have faithfully returned for seconds.  The replacement for John Goodman is Mark Addy, the obese male stripper in ""The Full Monty."" Rick Moranis' replacement is with Stephen Baldwin, whose most profound acting experiences uphold on the M&M's commercial. Kristen Johnson and Jane Krakowski substitute for the much funnier Roise O'Donnell and Elizabeth Perkins. Not coincidentally, these new actors, especially Addy and Baldwin, fit their dumfounded characters perfectly.The film details the fossilized lives of best friends Fred and Barney before they marry and conceive children. The two meet their future wives, Wilma and Betty, at a fast food restaurant. Conflicts evolve when Fred falls in love with Wilma and her filthy rich mother (Joan Collins) requires her daughter to romance playboy ex-boyfriend (Thomas Gibson) and skip poor Fred. Another subplot involves an alien (Alan Cumming) being sent from another planet to observe human mating rituals. Of course, Fred and Barney are right in the middle of the creatures' mishaps.I never cared about any of the characters in this movie; none of them have any motive or brains outside of the script. There is no effective tension contained in the love story either. The production dim-wittily attempts to portray suspense and involvement with romantic competition Wilma experiences. The ""Rock Vegas"" blackmail scheme contributes brief uptightness in the audience, but its conclusion will leave you laughing with pity.
As far as humor goes, ""The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas"" is lacking of any funny material due to incredibly poor writing. There are dozens of slapstick jokes about dinosaurs, rocks, style, aliens, obesity, and clumsiness, but none have any life. At least similar comedies ""My Favorite Martian"" and ""What Planet Are You From"" were appropriately wacky. ""The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas"" is too corny for its own good. There were a few scenes that were so pathetic I could not hold my laughter back, but I was laughing at the movie, not with it. Several of these horrible sequences transpire through ridiculous dialogue. Here are a few examples:Fred complimenting Wilma in a love scene ""Your eyes are like two big eyes""Wilma to her family who is disbelieving of her passion for Fred ""They love me for who I amnot who I am.""As bad as the original ""The Flintstones"" was, ""The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas"" is a whole lot worse. Perhaps there is no coincidence the two movies acquire the same director, Brain Levant. This man has created bad films before (""Problem Child 2,"" ""Jingle All The Way""), but never anything as putrid as this pile of bones. After reading this critique, I fear you may misinterpret my implication; this movie is not so bad that it's funny, it is so bad it's bad.",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
22,rossrobinson,When Fred Met Wilma,10,27 July 2004,"The Flintstones: Viva Rock Vegas i think is a good movie but not as good as the orignal one (The Flintstones (1994) The movie is based before the original, and to me it's an idea just like the 2nd movie to Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry met Lloyd. In this 2nd movie of the flintsones, it's based on with Fred meeting Wilma and Barney meeting Betty. They all set off to Viva Las Vegas, to enjoy themselves and to do whatever they want to do. When Fred proposes to Wilma, they both find a house (That white rock house, in the original movie) In this movie, there were actors who i haven't seen before, the one that played Barney, i've never ever seen him in any other movies, i the only actors in this movie who i've seen before is Joan collins who played Wilma's mother, the guy who played Fred, he's comes from York which is a place i know so well, the woman who played Wilma, i think she was from the series 3rd Rock From The Sun. Those are the actors who i know. I give this movie 10 out of 10.",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas

Fred was obviously thinner and arguably better looking, but was Barney any taller?This light hearted introduction to the world of the ""Flinstones"" very capably filled in a big gap in the original series and the previous movie (with a little (literally) alien intervention thrown in)--has anyone ever shown people in outer space visiting earth during the caveman era?Fred this time was not as good as in the prequel, but Barney and Betty were orders of magnitudes better.  Since Joan Collins lost out to Elizabeth Taylor for the role of ""Cleopatra"", and they competed again, I must say, I thought Joan Collins did a better job of Wilma's mother than Liz did.",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas

Stephen's character is the most true and imaginative, superb.Mix and match, Fred Flinstones is not suitable for Wilma because of the height.

28,TuckMN,"A big, bright, noisy, colourful mess.",4,30 April 2000,"This second live action rendition of the animated cartoon by Hanna-Barbera seems to be uncertain of whom its audience is -- there is scatological humour for the kids (and like-minded adults), romance, song-and-dance routines, a Mick Jagger impersonator -- but the whole melange didn't really mesh into a cohesive whole.The story of how Fred (Mark Addy) and the perfectly cast Barney (Stephen Baldwin) meet, woo, and eventually conquer the hearts of Wilma (Kristen Johnston) and Betty (the incomparable Jane Krakowski) is over-involved and too convoluted for small children; but the bright colours and action kept the kids at the matinee we were at quiet -- for the most part.Joan Collins as Wilma's scheming mother (and her FABULOUS costumes) was an absolute delight to the eye.  Harvey Korman as her father did little more than grunt occasionally.There were some good sight gags and jokes, and the inevitable stone and rock puns, but they were all aimed at the adults.Kids raised on Pokeman and Nickelodeon are not going to really enjoy this movie -- but they will probably beg their parents to take them and Mom and Dad will enjoy it more than the kids will.",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas

30,PJS-5,"***** A perfect 5 stars:An excellent underrated ""simple-gag"" comedy that slightly surpasses its original.",10,8 May 2000,"The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas (2000) Directed by Brian Levant (Beethoven) Starring: Mark Addy (Full Monty), Stephen Baldwin (Fled), Kristen Johnston (3rd Rock from the Sun), Jane Krakowski (Ally McBeal),Thomas Gibson (Dharma & Greg), Alan Cumming (Goldeneye), Joan Collins (Dynasty), Harvey Korman (The Original Flintstones series) Featuring voices of: Mel Blanc (Jetsons the movie), Rosie O'Donell (The Flintstones) Rated PG: Light Adult Content, One swear word. (Yes, that can happen because that is the reason why the 1998 film ""Madeline"" got a PG rating) Genre(s): Family, Comedy, Romance, Based on a TV show (The Flintstones animated series of the 60's) Summary: It is basically a prequel of the 1994 underrated hit. (The Flintstones starring John Goodman). Fred (Addy) and Barney (Baldwin) just got their jobs in the rock quarry. Barney is feeling highly in content of his life although Fred is unsure of his future. Yet they'll meet ""The Great Gazoo"" (Cumming) for the 1st time soon enough. Meanwhile Wilma (Johnston) despite her financially wealthy life is feeling rather bored with her glamorous but rather humdrum life. After all she has her overbearing mother (Collins) her ex-boyfriend soon to be suitor for financial reasons of course Chip Rockefeller (Gibson) and who is trying to win Wilma's heart for financial reasons only, but at least she had her senile but good-hearted father (Korman). Wilma tries to escape her wealthy but unhappy life. So she runs away and gets a job at a local fifty-ish fast food place. Soon she meets with Betty (Krakowski) after trying to give a reason why she came there in the first place (but failing because Betty wouldn't let her completely explain) Betty gets Wilma a job at the fast food place. (Known as ""Bronto King"" gee try to guess what product plug in joke that was suppose to be.) Soon Fred and Barney meet the girls and you pretty much have an idea what's going on here. 
 The good: If it weren't for the fact that this was a prequel the casting would look downright absurd. (I mean c'mon a Baldwin Brother as Barney Rubble? I don't hate the Baldwins but still). The special effects are first rate. Yet despite the special effects and the gags this isn't just ""eye candy with simple gags"" the movie was well made as itself. The cast did well & the performances were well done too. Despite the fact that this is a PG film this is perfectly fine for the whole family. And I can easily recommend this to any Flintstone fan. (Although I am not a Flintstone fan, I did enjoy the show and the movies though). The animals were a really nice touch such as dino (Blanc) a massaging squid (O'Donell) and more. From start to finish this film plays out really well. Overall this is one of the best ""gag"" comedies I have seen for a while but so far the animation world is on a winning streak this year I hope the simple gag comedy world can do the same. (Although it's rather unlikely)
The bad: The humble morality element in this is a bit schmaltzy, but that is no big deal. But if you don't like comedies that its humor is mainly simple-gags then you may want be careful.

31,Chiller7,Silly fun,10,18 December 2016,"I had the VHS of the original live action Flintstones movie as a kid and watched it many times. But I never did see the sequel. By the time it came out years later, I was at that age where I was too old to want to see it.Fast forward to 2016, currently I've been really into DC's great new Flintstones comics series (It's hilarious. I highly recommend it.), so since I was in the mood for all things Flintstones, I just rented this movie to watch it finally.This movie was silly enough to keep me amused throughout. Yes, the story is dumb and all the characters are idiots, but they're lovable idiots - all the actors clearly had a good time - and it's all so bright and colorful and cheery that you can't hate it.I laughed aloud at enough of the ridiculous scenes throughout the movie, such as Dino's big moment, or the prehistoric TV remote control, that I can't rate this movie any lower than a 10 out of 10. I enjoyed this silly movie.Surprise cameo: Not exactly a ""cameo,"" since he wasn't famous back then, but it was funny to see John Cho in an early tiny role as the valet who gets beat up by Fred and Barney.",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
32,Ken-208,Was actually very good..I was surprised and enjoyed it,7,12 July 2000,When I saw the low score on the Internet Movie Database for this movie I was expecting the movie to be a dud...but I went anyway because I liked the cartoon when I was a kid.  After I saw it I think people have been too critical.  I really enjoyed the movie.  There were numerous parts where myself and the audience laughed.  I'd give this movie a 7 out of 10.The props and effects were very creative and it was funny and enjoyable seeing how they tried to make a live action movie mimic the television cartoon.  The movie had a lot of cleaver inventions that used animals or stone age technology.  Perhaps some people rated this low because they went to the movie expecting something other than the Flintstones.  This a movie based on a cartoon and therefore it should be the way it is.  The movie does a good job of providing light-hearted and cute humor like what was done in the television show.  If you liked the Flintstones television cartoon then I think you'll like this movie.,The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
33,rastaban3,Surprisingly good.,7,24 February 2002,"I saw the first live action Flintstones film and I did not like it at all. It was completely unoriginal as it took directly from one of the episodes of the cartoon.  So when I heard the prequel was coming out I did not want to see it.  However, my wife brought it home as a rental for the kids and they wanted me to watch it with them.  So I did.  I have to admit, this film surprised me.  It had a very original plot and a different view of how they all got together.  I found that very refreshing.  Granted, this one did not follow the original cartoon series story line too well but that is forgivable when you begin to realize what this film is about, finding the right person you should marry.The plot line is solid and is generally presented well.  There are a few painful spots in the film and there are some good comedy scenes as well. The oversized props are generally good and Dino as a puppy just remined me of my Labrador when she was a puppy.  Full of life and hyper!!  Just the way a young puppy is.  The other special affects were also rather good.However, the choices of Mark Addy as Fred and Kristen Johnston as Wilma I have to question. They did not seem to have the personality to match their characters.  John Goodman did a better job as Fred Flintstone and I feel would have been a better choice.   On the other hand, the choices of Stephen Baldwin as Barney and Jane Krakowski as Betty were excellent!!  They seemed to fit their characters well.I was also surprised as how low this film was rated by other users.  I thought this to be disappointing, considering how bad the first one was. This prequel was far and above superior to the first.Overall, worth your while (7 out of 10).",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
34,atlihafsteinsson,Give this one a chance,7,11 January 2013,"I really don't understand what most of the reviews here were going for. The movie doesn't make sense? It's the Flintstones, it has never existed to make sense! To be fair, many big-name sequels are dreary affairs with no heart, especially when they're prequels. But that is definitely not the case with Viva Rock Vegas.Viva Rock Vegas is the story of when Fred and Barney met Wilma and Betty. Frustrated with her oppressive mother (Joan Collins playing a b**** like only she can), upper-class Wilma Slaghoople runs away from home and meets Betty O'Shale at a diner, who takes Wilma under her wing under the impression that she's poor. Fred and Barney walk into their lives and soon sparks are flying. That is, until Fred discovers what a rich background Wilma really has, one that he intends to impress when the four of them are invited to the Rock Vegas casino of Chip Rockefeller, Wilma's shady suitor. Overseeing all of these antics is the futuristic alien Gazoo, sent to Earth to oversee humans' mating rituals and having the bad luck of taking Fred and Barney as his objects of study.I was not at all expecting to like Viva Rock Vegas, but I did, and it's a joy to watch every time it comes on TV. The cartoon atmosphere works pretty well in live action, and the actors are even improvements on the original live action cast. Mark Addy makes a much better Fred, and Jane Krakowski is a particularly excellent Betty. Stephen Baldwin captures the innocent slow-wittedness of Barney well. Alan Cumming (""I am INVINCIBLE!"") seals the deal in two very different but equally hilarious roles as Gazoo and the rock star Mick Jagged.The movie is very entertaining and very funny. It doesn't try to be anything more than that and it succeeds admirably. It seems there is no place for innocent comedies on the internet these days, but you could do worse than give this one a chance. Much, much worse.",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas

But this one? Ugh! My first complaint is with Stephan Baldwin playing Barney. I thought he was trying too hard to act and sound like Barney. He just came across as goofy! I didn't think Harvey Korman should have had a part in the first movie and defiantly not this one! He was like a joke and I hated that! Rosie O'Donnell should not have been in this one either! I thought the other actors were great, but the script was a little messed up. Why was Alan Cummings playing plural roles?! Come on, guys! Fred and Barney switching dates was in poor taste, too! Who thought that mess up?! My last gripe is Ann-Margaret singing Viva Rock Vegas! I love her, she has a great voice, but this was not her song! She was great with Elvis in the 1960s Viva Las Vegas and that was good enough! Imo, Alan Cummings did a great job with the song. They should have let his version be played in the plane ride scene to Rock Vegas! I'm done. Ouch! I have a headache! LOL!",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas

This one had decent performances, really excellent art direction, and some really cool FX. I especially liked the Bronto-bridge and the Great Gazzoo.

I mean all the kids love it, it's on Cartoon Network all the time and it's a true classic. It's great.The trouble with a franchise like this is that there will be some companies that exploit a craze such as this and find ways to sneak you out of your money and rip you off. One such example is Flintstones Viva Rock Vegas.It's released in the summer of 2000, and it's a terrible film. It's tacky, lacking in plot, miscast & just truly awful. Now I know that bad films like this are released all the time and that's nothing new. However what's so special about the Flintstones VRR more than anything else is that upon it's release over here, it cost £20.That's right folks. Us punters in the UK had to fork out 20 notes for this prehistoric guff. Now here's the worrying part. A lot of Flintstones fans just looked at the box and said ""Wow! Flintstones movie!"" And they bought it and obviously they regretted it soon enough. So I now am going to show you how to have an infinitely better Flintstones experience.1) The Flintstones series on video: If you are a Flintstones fan you probably already own one, but if you want to give it a rent now, it is priced about £1:50 tops.2) Fred Costume: You can pick these up in just about any car boot sale for about less than a fiver.3) Action Figures: There's plenty of them about, and they cost not even £3:50 in Toys R Us store.So what does that bring us up to? £10 max. For £10, you have all of these three things, and you're having a great Flintstones time.

53,TeddSaidHi,DO NOT spend your time watching this sorry excuse for an attempt at a film,1,19 August 2002,"I really can't say much about this travesty... but even if I could, I'd probably refuse to give this movie anything else.  I'll elaborate SLIGHTLY on the sad butchering of the Hannah-Barbarah classic...  THEY DIDN'T ACT LIKE THE CHARACTERS.  THEY DIDN'T ACT AT ALL.  THEY LOST THE FOCUS OF THE PLOT.  THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO EDIT EVEN....... aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh! (okay, I'm done)",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
54,gummitch-2,Now I know....,5,29 May 2003,"I've always wondered why the prequel to the successful Flintstones movie ended up as straight to video stuff. The plot itself was utterly dumb, and the ""SFX"" quite laughable. I would have thrown the VHS out of the window, were it not for the girl who played Wilma (I think she was pretty good), and most of all Alan Cumming. OK, Mr Cumming is definitely the best thing in this wreck of a movie: he steals the scene playing the Great Gazoo...and he completely revives the last part of the movie playing Mick Jagged (a kind of cross between Austin Powers and Mick Jagger). He was the only reason I didn't fall asleep.",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
55,lvalyani,I Kinda of like this,3,11 June 2020,"This is garbage. I kinda of like it. Everything is bad. The plot starts 2/3 of the way into the movie. The writing is horrendous. The acting is god awful. Visually the movie is incredibly ugly. It has some of the worst sound design I have ever heard. Honestly, the best part of this movie (other than Dementia Dad) is the god damn CGI. Also, I still have no idea how old they're supposed to be in this thing, they look 40, they act 40, but they're just graduating college?",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
56,crippler_p,Better Than I thought,6,18 June 2002,This movie was much better than the first one (with John Goodman).  It was surprisingly funny with jokes for both kids and adults.  It has the same feel as the original cartoon - but a little updated.  Baldwin does a really good Barney.,The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
57,griggsda,good cartoon fun,6,8 October 2013,"This film is good cartoon fun. No wasted scenes; it is short enough that it never drags. Harvey Korman gives the movie a connection with the original series (1960s). Joan Collins and Jane Krakowski brighten up any movie. The character Gazoo helps to solidify the plot. The humor is cute and in good taste. The set designs are colorful and clever; they keep every scene lively.I have only two criticisms. The resolutions to the main conflicts are a little too easy.Also, they should have let Jane Krakowski sing (perhaps instead of Mick Jagged). Jane is an excellent singer; she is probably the biggest talent in the cast. Jane K. has an on-camera charisma that begs comparison to Marilyn Monroe, and her body language is always flawless and engaging.",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
58,Wookiee-Monster,Entertaining Family Film,9,12 May 2003,"Although I missed this film on the silver screen, I did happen to see it on video and was thoroughly impressed.The sets and props alone were well done and all characters were convincingly played in the Hanna-Barbera cartoon style.Surprisingly enough, too many have rated and criticized this film as though it were in competition for the Oscar with heavy-hitter dramas, forgetting that, to put it quite redundantly, it's The Flintstones!Honestly now, there's no need to go overboard with the Siskel & Ebert-esque scouring of this piece and just sit back and enjoy it.  Whether or not children are present, I'd easily give it ""two thumbs up.""",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
59,OBehaveWanKenobi,"The Version of the Flintstones was Spot On Like the Cartoon from My Childhood, I loved it",8,29 December 2019,"The outstanding: Stephen Baldwin's Barney Rubble impression is spot on. The guy playing Fred Flintstone did awesome as well. I loved the actresses who did Wilma and Velma. Velma's laugh was spot on. Using audio footage of Dino was brilliant. >Spoiler Alert< I adore the story of the rich schemer now in debt plotting to get rich again by marrying Wilma and how he gets his due in the end. The cast was very well done. I loved, loved, loved the animals whining about their chores just like the cartoon. Thumbs waaaaay up. Aaaaaaand now the bad: The alien comment about evolution was unnecessary. As well as the alien wanting to see a mating ritual, thinking two guys were going to get it on was simply just yuck. Thank God Fred Flintstone chastised him for his comment. But if you throw out these miss steps, the film is a masterpiece. I would give it 10 stars but the bad writing in those two scenes drops it by 2 stars unfortunately. So much potential here wasted by bad miss steps. Write better please and give us a cleaner sequel, thank you. P.S. - Don't change the cast ether.",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
60,geatornez82-202-283937,Was This Trip Really Necessary?,1,4 November 2021,"This is a prequel to the first live action Flintstones movie, which I didn't think was that good. This tells how the Flintstones and the Rubbles first got together, and they changed it from the original cartoon, and I really don't understand why they did that, other than it makes it more dramatic, or something along those lines.The casting wasn't all that great, either, in my opinion. Mark Addy and Kristen Johnson were only okay as Fred and Wilma, but Stephen Baldwin made Barney look like an idiot, and I found Jane Krakowski's Betty to be a bit annoying. Then, there's the Great Gazoo, who originally came into the picture in the cartoon in the last season. Here, Fred and Barney meet him before they even meet the girls. It would have been much better if they did a CGI Gazoo that looked more like the original character, and got his original voice, Harvey Korman (who did appear in this movie as Wilma's father, actually) to do the voice. Alan Cumming's head on a CGI body was kind of off-putting, and maybe it would have been better if the body was a bit more proportionate to the head.I think the only thing I liked about this movie was Harvey Korman as Wilma's slightly senile father, and Dino as a baby dinosaur (so cute!), as well as using archived vocal effects from the late, great Mel Blanc (Dino's original voice actor).",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
61,Nik-14,Why wasn't this a straight to video release?,3,7 May 2000,This film was bad.  In the past these sequels have been delegated to video only.  The acting wasn't bad.  Joan Collins was superb as Wilma's rich mother.  A couple of jokes were great.  But it was slow.My 8 year old son loved the film.  I would've walked out if I could.  I think I would rather watch The Pokemon Movie again.,The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
62,MemphisGuy,Very funny movie.,8,9 June 2000,"When I first started watching the movie I thought, ""geez this is stupid"". Then I realized that I needed to see what the movie really was, a cartoon. After realizing that, I came to appreciate it.  It was wonderfully silly. The addition of Joan Collins in the cast was hilarious.  I highly recommend the movie, just have a light hearted attitude when you watch it.  The gadgets are a hoot!!!  :)",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
63,settember,Yabba Dabba Do!,8,15 August 2001,"Funny, cute, witty, with great sets and costumes! I was skeptical after the awful 1994 version, but found myself very pleased with this version. It has a great cast  that are very much like the cartoon characters, even their voices and laugh. The plot is better too, it held both my mother and grandmother's interest as well. It takes place before the cartoon, when and how Fred and Wilma met. Also includes Gazoo (Alan Cumming), the 3rd rock from the sun girl (Kristin Johnson as Wilma), the younger Baldwin, Joan Collins and more. Go see it, it's great for ALL ages, you'll have a gay ole time.",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
64,mcomer,Made to sell lunch boxes.,3,23 January 2001,"In essence, I didn't really like this one.  There is only one facet that is better than the original, the rest of the movie doesn't even come close to being as good as the original.The one facet that is better than the original is the actress playing Betty. This actress is a MUCH better job than the other actress that acted in the original Flintstones movie.Buy it?  Ha!  ""absolutely not"".Rent it?  A VERY remote ""maybe""...",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
65,isabelle121,Was very cute and had a good flowing storyline,8,1 May 2000,"Very cute movie for the whole family to go to. Had a lot of entertainment for the children audience, for it added a lot of need computer graphics that were fun to watch. They also through in a few jokes for the adults, that only the adults would understand which made it quite funny.The cast worked really well together. Stephen Baldwin did the perfect Barney Rubble, much better then Rick Moranis played it in the 1994 Flintstones Movie. Stephen actually played the character like Barney was in the cartoon, kind of brainless but adorable, not foolish and clumsy. It was great entertainment and an altogether winner.",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
66,ragman-7,Lighten up harsh reviewers.,7,22 October 2015,"This movie is not for the uptight movie viewer. Those who need a great plot and a message and theme and all the other tenets of good cinematography. And I can be one of those at times. I can hate a movie that tries too hard to be great cinema in stead of great entertainment. The movie is not great cinema, but is great entertainment.This is just a fun movie. Mostly pointless, except if you just want to have some fun and not think a lot. What I really enjoyed was the sets and costumes. I love bright colors and this movie was Awesome on my 40 HDTV. And because the Movie is in 1:85 aspect ratio, It wasn't panned and scanned, which I hate. Best of all, I am a huge Jane Krakowsi fan. I find her gorgeous. Her playing the brunette Betty Ruble, vavoom. I couldn't take my eyes off her when she was on screen. I give it 7 stars for plan simple fun, great sets, costumes and vibrant colors. And of course my girl Jane.",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
67,yabado22,ANOTHER YABBA DABBA DELIGHT!!!,10,6 December 2001,"This is one brilliant and enjoyable film, despite what a lot of narrow minded critics say.  Mark Addy is magnificent.  He is as close as your going to get to the cartoon.  And Jane Krakowski IS Betty Rubble.  Stephen Baldwin is good as Barney Rubble.  He plays him as a bumbling idiot, which for Stephen Baldwin comes naturally.  Who was Kristen Johnston trying to be, herself?  If that is true, she did a fine job.  If she was trying to play Wilma Flintstone, she has a long, long, LONG way to go! The script is brilliantly written and is a very funny and touching story. The special effects and production design are amazing.  Brian Levant(the director) should be very proud.  This is quite an accomplishment.  I watch it and I have a Yabba-dabba-doo-time!!!",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
68,chipbrill,Words fail me...,1,10 December 2006,"Words fail me. I do not possess the proper powers of verbiage to fully communicate just how terrible this tripe is. If there are any saving attributes, they are masked by the thoroughly inane entirety of this mess.There is little, if anything, that has the humor of the original cartoon. The casting of Fred and Barney is, at best, awful. I suppose the actors portraying Betty and Wilma are somewhat grace-saving and Dino, well, what can you say about Dino that hasn't been said before.Thankfully, Pebbles and Bam-Bam were not yet around to have to endure this.",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
69,ThomasJ101,"a great, fun little movie",10,1 June 2008,"In reading a few of the negative reviews of this movie, I'm wondering if certain detractors actually even watched it. It's too easy for some people just to dis a flick because it is a sequel, or because it went straight to video, or because it's expected to be bad, or whatever. Don't let that happen with ""Viva Rock Vegas"": it is a fine little movie: fun, funny and visually rich in cartoony colors, costumes and sets. The acting (and voices) are top notch: Stephen Baldwin's ""Barney"" and Mark Addy's ""Fred"" are just fantastic; voices, mannerisms, etc. Jane Krackowski is spot on as Betty, (ditzy-ness and giggle-wise). Alan Cumming as ""The Great Gazoo"" is perfectly sarcastic and wise-ass. The CGI is very good, considering, as are the sets and costumes. The storyline makes sense, is plausible, and even engrossing (again, considering). For what it is, this is a great little movie, and compared to the first one (sheesh) it TOTALLY rocks (""rocks"". get it?). I defy anyone who can actually tell a good movie from a bad one to watch this movie IN FULL, ALL THE WAY and TO THE END, and tell me that they weren't entertained by it.",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
70,jeffreyharanvezina,Why does it exist?,4,10 October 2010,What was the point of this movie? Hollywood must have been missing ideas because a sequel to a movie that was already poorly received in the first place is pretty lazy so those this movie improves over this one? No not really the story is a standard love story thats predictable and the only difference is that it has the Flintstones name attached to it. This is a prime example of a movie that just sits there and hopes it will make just by its name. Now to be fair the movie is not awful but its just of poor quality to a point that you wonder if it was worth putting money on this project and just by the way the movie ended up being a commercial failure and getting razzie-nominated.,The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
71,deltoro-14393,I live it and don't know why.,8,29 April 2021,I understand why people don't like this movie because of the B list actors and they're really cheap filters that it has to make it look the way it does but I think it's really a great movie because it really looks like a cartoon and yeah the first movie was perfect with Moranis and Goodman but these two have chemistry as well so I think overall it's still an eight as well as it's nostalgic because let's face it there's never gonna be another Flintstones movie.,The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
72,lartola,Entertaining but not as good as the 1960s series,5,5 April 2007,"I just wonder why the makers of this movie made a total departure from what the original series presented.First and foremost, in the original series the Flintstones and Rubbles met while working at the Honeyrock Hotel, where the boys were bellboys and the girls were waitresses, rather than having the boys meet Betty at the burgers place and later Betty introduce them both to Wilma. Not to mention that we never heard of Wilma meeting Betty while she was a runaway.In addition, in this movie they have Fred and Barney meeting Gazoo even before they meet the girls. In the original series, however, Gazoo appeared for the first time in the sixth season, when the Flintstones and Rubbles were already married and had Pebbles and Bamm Bamm (who, along with Dino and Hoppy, were the only ones who could see Gazoo besides Fred and Barney). So if somewhere, Gazoo should have been in the first movie, not this one.",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
73,bettyz24,Spectacular in the support,8,27 June 2017,"I know a lot of people hate this movie and it's rated ridiculously low but it has always been a favourite of mine.Bright colours and goofy pre-historic puns make it easy for the whole family to watch, and if you have to get up to do something, you won't miss any crucial plot points.There may be some casting that you didn't like but Jane Krakowski is perfect as Betty and Alan Cumming is always perfect, he plays great as Great Gazoo AND Mick Jagged (""snag m. Even Joan Collins was outrageous as mother Slaghoople, but who else could bring glam to a time without modern techniques?? And, as reminder, she was a prequel version of Liz Taylor from the original. Special mention to Thomas Gibson as the handsome villain. I'm no movie producer or whatever but the sets looked mostly real, unlike most movies now filmed almost exclusively in warehouses, and the effects they do use are better than some I see now, 17 years later. Sure, if you look closely, the lighting is off or poor depth perspective on some of the fast-moving effects, but this was the show based on a cartoon style that repeated it's backgrounds while eyes and mouths basically had two positions, open and closed. The music is rompy and fun, classic style meet-cute and Vegas tunes. And who doesn't love an origin story? And I can't resist a Vegas movie. Hello? Ann Margrock seeing a stone-age Elvis cover? EPIC! Flintstones (this one and it's predecessor) are among the first of the live-action cartoon revivals, I cash cow that Disney is now suckling to. I haven't noticed any of the older reviews on here point out specific issues, so I would argue they weren't open to liking the movie in the first place.",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
74,micahmann22,Worst Movie Of All Time,1,21 February 2015,"This is not only a bad movie based on a cartoon. This isn't even just a bad prequel. This is wrong on one two many levels. The acting is the worst I've ever seen. The story is so clichéd.You know Fred & Wilma marry in the end just like in the cartoon. And Gazoo is probably the ""worst"" character ever to be put in a movie. It's stupid as far as all movies go. I hated this movie. That's right. This is worse than The Last Airbender, Saving Christmas & Jack & Jill rolled into one movie. Under any standards of movies, this is definitely on an insulting level to not just me, but the movie lovers, Flintstones fans, & people that just hate movies. Don't watch this movie. You're better off with The Last Airbender, Saving Christmas & Jack & Jill. I'd give this movie a zero if that was an option. Worst Movie Ever.",The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas
