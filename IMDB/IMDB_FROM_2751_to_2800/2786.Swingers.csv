0,SnoopyStyle,Memorable character,7,23 June 2014,"Mike (Jon Favreau) is suffering from the end of his six year relationship. He obsessively waits for her phone call as he tries to make it as a comedian. His friend Rob (Ron Livingston) from back east is struggling to get into acting. Trent (Vince Vaughn) is his talkative friend with the infamous words ""Vegas Baby"". The gang of friends try to pick up Babies and convince Mike that he's Money.Vince Vaughn is giving a way over the top performance. Jon Favreau's character is a little sad and pathetic. Their combo is amusing until it becomes annoying. What sold me is the scene with the phone calls. The first three calls are amusing. Then the movie goes for broke and gets to another level. There is pathetic and then there is really funny pathetic. As a writer, Jon has created a memorable character with Vince. It's the second movie for director Doug Liman and pulls it all together.",Swingers
1,Prismark10,Hip and Go,7,16 October 2016,"The important thing about the very low budget Swingers is that it involved people who went on to become Hollywood titans. It was directed by Doug Liman (his second film) written by and stars Jon Favreau and features a star making role from Vince Vaughn.Both Favreau and Vaughn are noticeably younger and leaner. I guess Favreau wrote a film that in some ways is autobiographical.It is a nod to films like Diner and Marty. A film about unemployed showbiz types looking for that break in the career ladder which at the moment consists of rejection. They hang out together in clubs and bars, they act out like they are a low rent rat pack going to Vegas and dancing in retro swing clubs.Mike (Favreau) is a comic who has come to Hollywood from New York and struggling to find work and get over his hang up with his girlfriend who has broken up with him. His best buddy is energetic, motor mouthed Trent (Vince Vaughn) who wants to cheer up Mike and get him laid. Trent is a shark when it comes to women, he has no problems chatting them up and then devouring them.Together with two other hipster buddies they go to Vegas to cruise and make out. Mike hooks up with a girl but makes a mess of leaving a message in an answer phone.The film has attitude, laughs and an edginess. It is a Generation X tribute to the ensemble guys comedy, in some ways inspired by Woody Allen with its nervy humour and makes good use of Los Angeles and Las Vegas locations, which looks familiar to me as I visited both cities around the time the film was released.",Swingers
2,classicsoncall,"""You're so money and you don't even know it.""",7,13 June 2018,"Every time the characters called each other 'Money' I had to cringe. The context never worked for me even though I knew what they were trying to say. The main story here is Mike (Jon Favreau) and Trent (Vince Vaughn), and some of their situations were ridiculous, but probably not enough to write home about. The scene where they meet up with Christy (Deena Martin) and Lisa (Katherine Kendall) should have sent the girls packing, I couldn't understand how they wound up back at the girls' trailer. You know Vaughn's character doesn't believe a word he's saying which makes his statements funny, but I don't know how the girls didn't see right through him. Mike on the other hand is so lacking in self confidence and wallowing in such misery over a broken relationship that he can't move on with his life. I guess a guy can relate to both characters during a similar period in one's life, and in fact, their dialog is probably more realistic than one would care to admit. My favorite scene would have been the six phone calls in a row with Mike stepping all over himself until he gets the 'Don't call me ever again' response. When Mike broke out of his funk with that swing number by Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, you just had to know his troubles were over. At that point, he was so money he didn't even know it.",Swingers
3,gavin6942,When Will People Admit Heather Graham Is Not Hot,5,18 December 2005,"I had a fair amount of anticipation for this film, because I am an avid Vince Vaughn fan. Okay, wait, maybe not avid... but moderate at least. Most shocking thing: Vince is so very young in this movie (his breakthrough role). Most disappointing thing: Not nearly enough Ron Livingston. Coolest scene: the hockey scene, with the blood-soaked Wayne Gretsky and the Reservoir Dogs poster. Or maybe the scene where they say all directors rip off other directors as they do a nearly-identical scene from Goodfellas.Plot: Mike and Trent scout the earth looking for girls. Trent's a**hole approach works wonders, but Mike - who just got out of a six-year relationship - keeps botching it up for both himself and Trent. Watch the movie have many Sinatra-themed scenes, one of the most depressing scenes ever with an answering machine, and other assorted goodness.Conclusion: I'm fairly torn on this film, but I think I liked it. The subject matter wasn't something I could relate to, and I could use more Ron Livinston and less Jon Favreau. But considering everything, I think the film is worth seeing. Recommended.",Swingers
4,jboothmillard,Swingers,5,26 May 2018,"I had heard the title of this movie a few times, including when one of the leading actors mentioned it in an interview or two, I had my assumptions of the meaning of the title, but I was looking forward to trying it for myself, directed by Doug Liman (The Bourne Identity, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Jumper, Edge of Tomorrow). Basically Mike Peters (Jon Favreau) is a struggling comedian who left New York City to find success in Los Angeles, and he is still upset about his girlfriend of six years, Michelle, breaking up with him six months ago. Mike's womanising friend Trent (Vince Vaughn, also writing) wants to help Mike with his depression, they and other aspiring actors try and get back into the social scene. Mike talks to his friend Rob (Office Space's Ron Livingston) about how desperately he misses Michelle, and that she has not called him, Rob thinks that she will only call him once she has completely moved on. To help Mike out, Trent coaxes him into an unplanned trip to Las Vegas. Trent succeeds in picking up two waitresses, but Mike's obsession with Michelle ruins things. Back in Los Angeles, Mike, Rob and other friends go bar hopping, stopping at a party, where Trent demonstrates his prowess in handling the opposite sex. Mike is inspired by this and meets a girl named Nikki (Brooke Langton) and gets her phone number, however he makes a number of increasingly anxious and desperate messages on her answering machine, to the point when she answers and disgustedly tells him not to call again. Mike misses Michelle more than ever, he contemplates moving back to New York until Rob comes over and consoles him. Out again for swing night at a Hollywood night club, Mike meets a girl named Lorraine (Heather Graham), he gains courage to approach her and connect with her. The next morning, Mike is called by Michelle, but he finds he no longer misses her, he also receives a call from Lorraine, he decides to end the call with Michelle to connect further with Lorraine. Also starring Patrick Van Horn as Sue and Alex Désert as Charles. Favreau does well as the out-of-work actor whose confidence has been shattered, and Vaughn gives a great performance as his charismatic friend refusing to let him wallow, Favreau's script is semi-autobiographical, based on his own experiences working in Hollywood, I will admit I did not follow a full story, but all the swinging parties and loads of men having banter, picking up women and complaining a lot is amusing, not a bad comedy drama. Worth watching!",Swingers
5,grantss,Has its moments but generally bland,5,28 May 2020,"Six months after leaving his girlfriend of six years Mike still misses her. He has moved from New York to Los Angeles where his friends try to get him back into the social scene. Things don't go that smoothly.I set my expectations quite low for this film. The presence of Vince Vaughn made me expect a low-brow comedy. To my surprise, it isn't, and is better than expected, but still isn't great.Swingers is more a drama than a comedy and the subject is dating and relationships, from a male perspective. Has some good moments, both comedic and dramatic, but is generally filled with empty melodrama and is quite bland.As predicted, Vince Vaughn has a negative effect on proceedings, being more annoying that funny. Jon Favreau, who also wrote the script, is okay in the lead role, though I got tired of his self-pity routine.Overall, (slightly) more miss than hit.",Swingers
6,view_and_review,Young Favreau,6,22 December 2020,"Back when Jon Favreau was younger and fitter he wrote this little piece. He played Mike, an east coast transplant in L.A. trying to make it in showbiz all the while steadily crying about his lost love Michelle. He's buzz killington when with his hip friends who hit the party scene nightly. All you want for poor pathetic Mike is for him to find companionship. It doesn't even matter if it's a short term thing or a long term thing, just get over the loss and move on.",Swingers
7,evanston_dad,Boys Will Be Boys,8,17 June 2009,"A very funny comedy about a bunch of single dudes trying and failing to hook up.Though the film has a dirty sense of humor that's perfectly matched to the material and characters, it's got a sweet heart at its center. The point is of course that men just need to be themselves, that women appreciate honesty and that nice guys don't necessarily have to finish last.This was the breakout movie for Vince Vaughan, and with the exception maybe of ""Dodgeball,"" this is still the best thing he's done.Grade: A",Swingers
8,Mr-Fusion,It has swing when it really needs to,7,30 April 2017,"""Swingers"" is one of those legit '90s movies (NHL '94! Hipsters! Big Bad Voodoo Daddy!). Dated isn't the word to describe this, but time capsule is. If coffeeshop L.A. were a genre, this'd be its mascot.For me, the movie was sort of a grind in the beginning; nothing really clicked with these characters, the lounge poser shtick wasn't funny, and I just wasn't getting what made the movie such a big deal. But it was around the halfway mark that the magic started to happen. Vince Vaughn suddenly became funny, Favreau's angst really took on substance, and the friendship really blossomed. Once Heather Graham showed up and threw out some rays of sunshine, I was hooked.Good movie.7/10",Swingers
9,whpratt1,Girl Problems,10,10 July 2006,"Enjoyed this very down to earth film about a bunch of guys who are all looking for something special in the gals they meet and the boredom of the routine dating system everyone goes through in order to find a lasting relationship. This one guy goes with a gal for six years and then all of a sudden they drift a part yet the guy never stops thinking about her even though he meets other women and nothing seems to compare to this relationship. For some reason, this guy never seems to realize that he is deeply in love with this gal and needs to made her number one on his list of dates or better yet a simple phone call. Lots of comedy, drama and fantastic acting by all the actors.",Swingers
10,Smells_Like_Cheese,"To be honest, I felt awkward watching this movie",3,29 September 2006,"I have heard a lot about Swingers and how funny it is, in fact I had a friend almost yell at me when he found out that I have seen so many movies but I have not seen Swingers. So, obviously, I had to save the friendship, :P, so I went out to rent this. I am going to feel so bad about what to tell my friend because I really didn't get too into Swingers.I can see why this is a cult classic, I would never deny that it wasn't a good movie. I just really didn't laugh, there were a couple moments where I laughed very lightly, that was it. But the scene where Mike calls that girl Niki like 10 times to leave stupid messages, I laughed, but it was just so painful to watch. Now, I love Vince Vaughn, he is just a crazy and funny comedic actor, but I found him to be a little bit annoying in this movie. I don't mind repeated lines every once in a while, but ""money"" was just way too over used.Like I said, I'm not calling this a bad movie, because I can see why people got so into it, but I just didn't really enjoy it. I might give it a second shot just to see if there is anything there. Hopefully there is, otherwise my friend might question my expertise in movies. :D3/10",Swingers
11,MovieAddict2016,"It's money, baby, money!",8,3 May 2005,"""Swingers"" was released in the era of independent films -- heavily influenced by Quentin Tarantino, there is a reason that one of the characters in this movie has a Mr. Blonde poster on his wall and discusses ""Pulp Fiction"" vs. ""GoodFellas"" in one scene. (One of my favorites in the film, actually.) ""Swingers"" is mainly about Mikey (Jon Favreau), a guy who's just come out of a six-year relationship and can't focus on anything else. His best friend Trent (Vince Vaughn) is only worried about trying to get into bed with any woman in sight.They head out to Vegas for a night and Trent makes some money and picks up a girl, but Mikey loses $300 and winds up thinking about his ex-girlfriend again.Essentially the film follows Mikey as he tries to learn to forget about his ex, and move on with his life, which is a very hard thing for him to do. This film is based around shame and embarrassment, and the most uncomfortable scene has to be the one in which Mikey desperately calls a woman he met at a bar and leaves about 12 messages on her answering machine. The punchline to the scene is hilarious and cruel.""Swingers"" isn't quite as influential as it could have become. It inspired a cult following to go around saying things like, ""Money, baby!"" and it's definitely a guys' flick. (The male version of a chick flick, really.) It's not the huge breakthrough that ""Reservoir Dogs"" was but for its extremely low budget (I read $200,000) it certainly made a lot at the time of its release and solidified the careers of Favreau (who has gone on to direct and star in other productions), director Doug Liman (""The Bourne Identity"") and of course Vince Vaughn, whose career has gone somewhat down the drain since making this.Overall ""Swingers"" isn't flawless but it is a great insight into a jilted man's life and is more honest than about 90% of the films that are released through Hollywood nowadays. Its characters are very likable and three-dimensional and it entertained me throughout its short running time.",Swingers
12,paul2001sw-1,A certain sort of celebration of a certain sort of masculinity,5,16 May 2015,"Doug Liman's lively film 'Swingers' tells the story of a group of young men in Los Angeles, and one in particular, John Favreau's Mike, who is struggling to rebound after the end of a previous relationship. Mike is offset by his juvenile, sexist friends; and yet the film seems somehow to be celebrating as well as mocking their world of sleazy charm and, as they would assert (not always convincingly), easy women. For example, they use the expression ""you are the money"", as a way of hyping up each others' self confidence, which seems particularly unappealing, which the script seems to be both be laughing at and endorsing. Indeed, the overall plot is presented as an essentially happy story where at the end Mike is ""money"" once again. Liman handles this material with aplomb; but I'm not sure I'd actually like to live in his world.",Swingers
13,bowmanblue,If Goodfellas was comedy...,7,28 March 2015,"Swingers is about five guys who are dealing with single life in various different ways, all sharing experiences as they go from one L.A. bar to the next.That's about it. We follow their lives. A lot of people have criticised the film for having no plot. And they're right, it doesn't really. But does it matter? Only if you're really only interested in films with tight and deep plots. If you like your comedy a little on the adult side (and perhaps this film will appeal to guys over girls), plus are happy to follow these people and simply go along with the ride, you should get something out of this.It's kind of like a gangster film, but without the violence and crime. You have many long 'talkie' scenes, set around various bar tables in dingy clubs, while the protagonists sit back and discuss film trivia. This hardly drives the narrative forward, but, if you're into character pieces (and film trivia!) you should find it amusing.",Swingers
14,ThomasDrufke,That PG-13 guy you root for,8,4 May 2014,"Its one of those really smart 90's comedies. And one of the few really good Vince Vaughn movies that I actually like. What makes this movie work is the relatable characters it has. It involves a guy who is just trying to get over his ex girlfriend finding a new guy. And even though he's an actor/comedian he still comes off as relatable to us normal guys just trying to find somebody. Jon Favreau is great and plays well off the other few main cast members. It has its funny moments but isn't as humorous as advertised. Its well written and even has a real good ending that's ambiguous, which as a movie is extremely hard to do. I love the café seen where Vaughn thinks hes getting some weird vibe from the women, as being a fan of the Superhero Cafe on youtube is really cool to see.This movie even surprised me at some parts, because even when you think hes going to finally pull through and get a new girl the story turns and does something else. But i do think the whole story plot with the other group of guys who start a fight was a waste and not really needed for the overall story. Its also worth mentioning how likable Lorraine is as an actress. I'm interested to see if shes been in anything else worth seeing.8.0/10",Swingers
15,g-bodyl,This Film Is So Money!,9,22 April 2014,"I finally have gotten around to watching Swingers and I believe this film will connect with all younger males such as myself. This film is about as authentic as you'll get when it comes to Hollywood and real life. I just felt like I was involved in this movie as if it was my life. The dialog is so real and believable. This indie film is funny and heartfelt as it is about bromances and these men finding their way in life.Doug Liman's film is about two friends named Trent and Mike who like to party it up in Hollywood. Mike is a wannabe actor who is coming off a six-year relationship and Trent is his friend who wants him to move on and succeed in life.This is the film that made Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn household names. I never seen Favreau as that big superstar, but he has the ability as evident by this film. He certainly is capable of an actor as he is a director. Vince Vaughn is funny and very talkative. His catchphrase involving the use of money as an adjective deserves some props even if it does get annoying after awhile.Overall, Swingers is a great comedy that has great themes of young people trying to find their way in life. It's very authentic thanks to a realistic screenplay. There are many laugh-out-loud moments and one that will hold true to your heart. For the kind of film it is, I couldn't help but love it. I rate this film 9/10.",Swingers
16,The-Sarkologist,"The movie was good, but the characters irritating",7,11 December 2013,"This movie brings me to a bit of a dichotomy. The movie itself and the character interaction was good but the characters themselves irritated me. Basically we had the main character, Mike, had just lost his girlfriend, who said that she would give him a call. He is depressed (and this depression lasts 6 months) and his friend Trent tries to show him a good time. In the end he meets a girl who is in the same situation as he is and they end up going out.Mike spends the entire movie moping about his lost love and tries to extract sympathy from those around him. The problem here is that his girlfriend means everything to him, and when she is stripped away from him he has absolutely nothing left in his life. In fact he has quite a good life as he has friends, he is attractive, and his film career is on its way with a part in a pilot and hosting a comedy club. Yet he does not realise this, and in fact is so fixated on his ex-girlfriend that he ends up driving other girls away (though he elicits the sympathy of two waitresses in Las Vegas).His friend Trent is the opposite. He goes around with the belief that he is the greatest thing around. He believes that he can pick and chose his girls, and really treats them like sex objects. He cannot understand the deep rent in the relationship that Mike is experiencing. His answer is a couple of girls and pointless sex - that solves everything. His whole belief is undermined at the end when he believes that a woman is making baby faces at him when in fact she is making faces at her baby.What this movie does well is that it draws out the attitudes and beliefs of the characters. Even though they are annoying, they are real. People do feel depressed for six months after losing a love, especially if it is a relationship as such. I personally felt irritated over the characters, but the film itself was good.",Swingers
17,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Very relatable and surprisingly perceptive for a comedy,7,22 November 2006,"While the title and publicized images may pass ""Swingers"" off as a gimmicky comedy, the film is a lot more down to earth than one might expect.The film stars Jon Favreau, who plays a struggling comedian in L.A. named Mike that has just ended a serious relationship of six years. He turns to his buddies--the most important two of which are played by Vince Vaughn and Ron Livingston--to help him get back on his feet again.Favreau, who makes his debut as a writer and producer with the film, delivers a performance and screenplay that are very natural and realistic. While there is no gut-wrenching humor in the script nor in any one actor's performance, (though we see the roots of Vaughn's now thriving over-the-top comedic success in the film) it is clever through the painful reality of a single man who is clearly having troubles moving on with other women. We laugh at Favreau's struggle, but ultimately it is a result of identification with the social unease his character feels. Most comedies have you laughing at other characters, but many times in ""Swingers"" we find we're really laughing at ourselves, something that does not happen often in comedy, which allows for enough serious conversation to enter the film while at the same time not feeling overbearing like a drama might. Though Vaughn's advice and Favreau's pick-up skills are clearly laughable, there is a reality to them that strikes a chord.It is easy to want ""Swingers"" to be over-the-top and full of belly laughs, but it must be looked at as something else. The film could have done with a few bigger laughs and still managed to keep the overall down-to-earth tone, but the truth is it is more about the comedy of real life, which while not as entertaining, is much more honorable in many ways. As a result, it may not ever be known as a great 90s comedy, but it will not go completely overlooked.",Swingers

Insecurity, rejection, desperate longing to be wanted by the other sex. Its a story about a group of young male friends, who are constantly worrying how they look and which girls are looking at them.This story is a continuous POSE fest of the dating scene and it is making fun of it. And however subtle the humour is, it's spot on cute and cringe like kinda funny, because we all have been on dates that were a disaster. And man, does this story rub in all this mistakes and humiliations guys have to endure while dating...This is a guys movie. Guys trying to impress each other and trying to impress girls. But deep in their heart all these male characters are so innocent and cute, which makes the comedy effect of them trying to be SO cool, so delightfully funny to watch.Great dialogues. Really. Hilarious (true to life) characters. Subtle, satirical jokes. One of a kind comedy. Definitely something else and a joy to watch because of the creative direction and writing.",Swingers

20,aidanratesmovies,A Brave and Realistic Portrayal of Young American Life,10,23 April 2020,"Genuinely funny, entertaining, and emotionally impactful- Swingers is a one of a kind film that proves that the truth can often be the most interesting of stories. Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn are great in the film, and have great chemistry on screen together. All the supporting cast is very good as well, notably Heather Graham, and the film in total is very good at developing some good character depth. The film is impressive on many points, especially considering its low budget. It's cinematography is great, its music so as well, and it has many quotable lines that are destined to be iconic in the future (and now). The film is very funny, and very amusing. There are a few small moments in the film that make the film feel like it's dragging it feet, but it makes up for them by providing a very grounded and realistic tale of loss, dreams, and growing up. It's a coming of age tale, when you've already come of age, and is truly something we do not see in Hollywood today, and something we need more of desperately. In the end, Swingers is a surprisingly great time. It's acting is impressive, its low budget nature even more so, and the film is so layered with talent and emotions that it's simply impossible not to enjoy at least somewhat.

21,rbverhoef,Funny and uncomfortable,9,11 June 2003,"Mike (Jon Favreau, who also wrote the screenplay) lost his girlfriend Michelle six months ago and still talks about that everyday. He needs to be cheered up so Trent (Vince Vaughn) takes him to Vegas. They hook up with some waitresses, Trent gets what he wanted from one of them and Mike keeps talking about his lost girlfriend to the other one. After Vegas we follow Mike, Trent and others like Rob (Ron Livingston) and Sue (Patrick Van Horn). They go to coffee shops and talk about nothing, they visit parties where they try to hook up with girls.The movie starts with one uncomfortable scene after another involving Mike. You feel sorry for him, not because he lost his girlfriend but because he doesn't stop whining about it. Trent keeps saying how ""money"" Mike actually is.""I don't think she liked me anyway.""""Oh Mike, I'm telling you man, she thought you were money.""The scenes are uncomfortable but inventive in their own ways as well. Oh, and they are pretty funny. There is a scene where they talk about movies. First someone is mentioning the opening sequence in 'Reservoir Dogs' where the gang walks in slow motion. Then another one says Tarantino steals from Scorsese in his movies. The third one ends the conversation with: ""I don't see what the big deal is, I mean everybody steals from everybody, that's movies."" This conversation is followed by the gang walking in slow motion as in the opening sequence from 'Reservoir Dogs', and a scene with cars driving away definitely taken from 'Goodfellas'. Yes, this movie steals from other movies, it knows it does so, and it only improves this movie. About fifteen minutes before the end we see the first scene with Mike that is not uncomfortable. It made me kind of happy to see he also can do good and nice, that he really can be ""money"".Not the greatest movie you have ever seen, but definitely worth watching, very funny with some very nice dialogue and some good movie-stealing.",Swingers
22,RatedVforVinny,So many memorable lines.,8,6 November 2018,"A very funny U.S comedy, that has spawned some of the most quotable lines (in cinema history), such as ""You are so the money!"" and ""Always double down!""

23,PredragReviews,"""You're Money, you're so Money, you don't even know your Money!""",9,26 July 2016,"From beginning to end, ""Swingers"" is filled with smart dialogue and an undercurrent of nostalgia that rings true and familiar for every viewer regardless of whether you're a baby boomer, a Generation X'er, Y'er, whatever. Its themes of searching for ""the right one"" and their associated pain and embarrassment have been done before, but never with such cutting humor and a sense of urgency that asks aloud whether the storybook way our parents found love can be brought to today's sensibilities. And the big-band music and classic crooner soundtrack is a constant reminder of our parent's past. These elements, bringing the past to the present and vice versa, makes ""Swingers"" accessible to every generation and still wildly entertaining after multiple viewings.Most men can probably relate to both of the main characters: each representing one side of us in our dealings with women. On the one hand, the sensitive man who isn't afraid to reveal himself - and on the other hand, the player, who doesn't have any pretensions and makes no apologies for his brash behavior. Both are real and both have their pros and cons. They are both well-represented in ""Swingers"". The cast obviously works so hard to make it feel real, but they understand their characters so deeply, you can't tell how hard they're working until after the movie is over. Great script, great acting, great production values. I urge everyone who has yet to see this film, to do so immediately! Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",Swingers
24,lewiskendell,Definitely worth checking out.,7,5 February 2011,"""The point is, Mike, that it all depends on how you look at it.""Swingers is the quintessential guy movie. Not to say that a woman won't enjoy it, or that it's a stereotypical collection of all the things that men are supposed to love in movies, like a non-stop testosterone-fueled orgy of naked women, explosions, and violence. Nope, Swingers is the quintessential guy movie because almost every guy can relate to at least part of it at some time during his life. The uncertainty about your career, the lingering pain of losing a girlfriend you truly loved, the camaraderie (and annoyances) of your friends, the frustrating world of dating and the games and ""rules"" that come along with it, and the feeling of that moment when you finally realize that your life can go on without that other person it revolved around so long.The story focuses on Mike (Jon Favreau), an aspiring comedian in Los Angeles who has recently gone through a break-up with his long-term girlfriend back east, and his group of friends. Most of whom try to help Mike get over his break-up by meeting women in and around L.A. and Las Vegas. Especially his two best friends, ladies man Trent (Vince Vaughn) and Rob (Ron Livingston)  Most of the movie follows the group on their nightly romps through the city, or Mike as he struggles with the loss of the relationship that he was very much invested in.I enjoyed the casual conversations the guys had about women, video games, their job efforts, and other things. Swingers really nailed the dynamics of how guys act with each other.It's also pretty funny, though it's not a total comedy by any means. A lot of the humor derives from Mike's painful attempts to talk to women, after six long years off the market. There's a really hysterical sequence about Mike and a woman's answering machine later in the movie that will have you howling. I got the sense that Swingers is the kind of movie that holds up well after repeated viewings, and maybe even gets better. It's not amazing, or anything like that, but it is hard to imagine anyone (especially guys aged 20-29) not appreciating it.",Swingers

""Swingers"" is a movie about Mike Peters, who has moved to Los Angeles to become an actor, leaving his longtime girlfriend in the process. This movie is about Mike's friends trying to help him get over her, and bring him into the LA club scene.The movie was written by Jon Favreau based on his experiences in moving out to LA. Favreau plays Mike, while his best friend Trent is played by Vince Vaughn. Being friends in real life brings great chemistry between Favreau and Vaughn in the movie. The guys are hilarious together. Most guys will relate to the friendships populating this movie.The movie is fun while you're watching it, but, at least for me, it is forgotten shortly after the credits have rolled.

Filmed on a minuscule $200,000 budget, the story concerns a struggling Hollywood actor (Favreau) re-entering the dating scene following the collapse of a six-year relationship.The semi-autobiographical script was written by Favreau himself. It has plenty of humour and a certain aura of 'cool' while still remaining down-to-earth and relatable.Since Favreau wrote the screenplay with some of his friends in mind it's no surprise that the cast was composed mostly of relative unknowns. Supporting actress Heather Graham was probably the most established cast member at the time. Nevertheless, the one-two punch of Jon Favreau & Vince Vaughn in the lead roles gave the film plenty of energy and an easy-going swagger. In support, the aforementioned Heather Graham stood out, as did then unknown Ron Livingston.The direction by Doug Liman garnered a lot of attention at the time (and rightly so). Despite the budget restrictions, he delivered a lively, attractive presentation that established him as an up-and-coming talent. Affectionate homages to ""Reservoir Dogs"" & ""GoodFellas"" are among the film's most memorable scenes.The movie also excelled musically. The performances by swing revival band Big Bad Voodoo Daddy are a particular highlight but the movie also made good use of classic cuts by Average White Band (""Pick Up the Pieces""), Heart (""Magic Man""), Dean Martin (""You're Nobody till Somebody Loves You"") & Roger Miller (""King of the Road""), among others.Altogether, ""Swingers"" is a movie that far exceeded its limited resources. Funny & cool, yet still dramatically effective, it delivers more entertainment than most movies with hundred million dollar budgets.",Swingers
27,oneguyrambling,Vince Vaughn sets the bar high with his debut.,8,1 March 2012,"Here is a movie that almost made me feel sorry for actors, those poor guys who receive praise and adoration from total strangers, gifts and concessions from wealthy 'wellwishers', and tens of millions of dollars annually out of our collective pockets.But Swingers doesn't deal with your Tom Cruises or James Francos, it deals with guys n gals lured to Hollywood only to find they are better suited to roles as 'onlooker 3' and handing out flyers while dressed as a hamburger.Still, not my fault they ain't pretty enough What Swingers did manage to do better than almost every film in recent memory is to coin an entire vernacular that sounded both fresh and ridiculous at the same time, guys calling people 'money' incessantly and sounding like they are chatting each other up instead of merely conversing should be silly – and is – but it never seemed cooler.Of course in reality such conversations can only be held with other people who have seen the movie (otherwise they think you're insane) and furthermore only for a day or two afterwards, which should be a word of warning to those who still say ""Ohhh behave!"" in their best lousy Austin Powers voice.Swingers follows a small group of aspiring wannabe hep-cat actors as they futilely traverse the LA landscape seeking work, recognition, networking contacts and of course fame. And beautiful babies. Always the beautiful babies. But as alluded to above, not everyone walks in as Brad Pitt the movie star, there are hurdles and roadblocks for the unprepared and ill equipped.The two primary leads are Mike (John Favreau) and Trent (Vince Vaughan), neither are 'IN', though both handle this reality in extremely different ways. Mike is convinced that he never will find the fame and recognition that he craves,Trent on the other hand simply acts like he already is famous and recognizable in a kind of 'live the questions and you will come into the answers' headscratcher.Mike is short, a little dumpy, generally self deprecating and softly spoken,Trent is tall, good looking, slick and constantly talking loudly to anyone who'll listen – even if they don't want to.The film essentially follows these two and a couple of hangers on through three nights. The first finds Mike and Trent heading down the road to Vegas in an attempt to lift Mike's sagging spirits as he is both disenchanted with his lack of forward momentum, and pining for the girl he left back home (who to his chagrin has latched on to another man).The initial sequence neatly introduces the two characters and neatly displays the chasm in their respective personality types.Trent is insanely confident even in the face of much evidence that suggests he might not have just cause, and Mike is so vulnerable and insecure that a potential hook-up quickly turns into his own personal pity party.The second night sees the duo and a few friends heading out on the town back in LA. This sequence highlights more the image driven nature of Hollywood and those that desperately yearn for fame. No-one ever says what they mean, no-one is ever happy or content, and no-one really pays attention to anyone beside themselves lest they get their precious feelings hurt.It is during this night that Mike has a minor victory that swiftly turns into a morale crushing and confidence sapping personal catastrophe, in a scene that anyone who has seen the film would recognize as the 'answering machine scene'.Then they cringe and purse their lips The final night you will have to see for yourself, suffice to say I urge you to seek this film out if you have not already, because a film about a bunch of guys who are already operating in an alternate era when the film starts can hardly then be accused of becoming dated. Swingers is worth watching for many reasons, it is fresh, fun and funny, the language I have already spoken of but it must be heard to be believed, and if anyone ever wondered why a fat, passionless and annoying Vince Vaughan keeps getting work it can only be because Hollywood casting agents have this DVD in their collections, as he has appeared in precious little of value since.In Swingers though he is a whirlwind of energy and self confidence, a jive talking image conman who is unbelievably and instantly repellant, but equally as hard to stop watching.Final Rating – 8 / 10. Without Vince Vaughan Swingers is a 6 – just another movie with a couple of chuckles – with him it becomes a unique character driven film that is worthy of attention.Rewatch this film Vince, and sort yourself out, cos Couples Retreat ain't getting' it done.",Swingers
28,Spuzzlightyear,Better than Titanic!,10,24 July 1999,"Okay, I finally caught Swingers, since it's a movie a lot of people have been blabbering on about. I honestly did'nt expect too much from this film, as I, I don't know, just thought it was all going to be too clever for it's own good. So that's what I had in mind when I sat down to watch it. Boy, is this a GREAT movie. I have to say, it's been a while since I've enjoyed a movie THIS much. I just love everything in this movie, the acting is bang on, the story (really there's not that much of one) is great, but it's just the chemistry between the two friends that make this movie TOTALLY work. Hell, this is better then Titanic. By Far.",Swingers
29,baumer,One of the most money movies ever!,10,19 February 2001,"Warning, may contain spoilers.First I feel compelled to agree with another reviewer in here that said that after this movie you may feel the urge to call your friends ""BABY"" or ""MONEY"".  If that is the case, do not fret it, just go with the flow.  There are worse things that you could call them after certain movies, like Goodfellas or Reservoir Dogs.I think when I was about ten or twelve or fifteen, my wonder years, my only concern was to see the latest film by Spielberg or the latest sequel to First Blood and of course any number of one syllabled, one liner Arnold movies.  I only wanted to see films that I recognized.  When I was about fifteen, I dated a girl named Marnie, who worked at the local theater in Forest Glade in Windsor Ontario.  This was convenient because not only was she pretty but she could get me into movies for free.  This is the summer that I became quickly hooked on movies.  I loved them before, but now I was addicted.  The problem was, the only films I was privy to at the time were films like Rambo, Commando, Secret of My Success, Burgler and so on.  These were all films that I enjoyed thoroughly and they acted as somewhat of a catalyst for me to see some other films that perhaps normally I would avoid. I can remember seeing David Lynch's Blue Velvet and then films like The River's Edge or even straight to video bombs like Zandalee.  It doesn't matter if these films were good or not, the point is that as I grew in age, my taste and insatiable hunger for films of all types grew.  I was finally ready to see the not so prime time films, the ones that may have a budget of less than $30 million.  I began to appreciate films like Boyz N The Hood, Clerks, Reservoir Dogs, El Mariachi and of course Swingers.  Swingers is a film that if you were pretty much into mainstream films ( in 1996 of course ), you may avoid.  There were no real stars in this film.  It was a film made for $200 000, and it didn't have explosions, car chases and a fight scene every five minutes.  That is why films like this make 4 million dollars at the box office, there is no mass appeal to them.  But when you can find a film like this on video, it makes you appreciate film for all the positive aspects of it.  It makes you appreciate the fact that there are people like Jon Favreau, Doug Liman and Vince Vaughn.  These are people that seem to love what they do and it is exemplified perfectly with Swingers. That is not to say that you can't enjoy films like True Lies, Titanic, Forest Gump, Hannibal and any other big budgeted Hollywood film because you can, but sometimes the best films out there are films that may not find a true audience until it hits video.  Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino can lay claim to that fact and so does Doug Liman and Jon Favreau's Swingers. This is one of the best films to come out of 1996 and it was made for 100 times less than Titanic.  Swingers is about breaking up, how hard it is to break up, films and the Hollywood scene, friendship, guys, swing dancing and so much more.  Jon Favreau plays Mikey, who has just moved out to California because his girlfriend of six years dumped him.  He has been single six months but still checks his messages every day to see if she has called.  He checks them so frequently that one morning while his friend Trent ( in a fantastic comedic performance by Vince Vaughn ) is in the middle of scoring with a cocktail waitress, he has to use the only phone available, the one in the bedroom. This scene is perfect but the scene to follow is even better.  Mikey apologizes to Trent for ruining his good time and Trent replies,""Don't worry about it Mikey.  I just wanted to get you out and show you a good time.""or something to that effect.  Friendship is important to these cast of characters.  That is evident when Mikey's best friend Rob, who has also moved out to L.A. from New York, is the only one that Mikey really seems to be able to talk to.  They share some very real and passionate scenes together and their talks about making it in Hollywood and learning to let go of the past are some of the best written scenes in any film.  This is work similar to the candor and starkness of Smith and Tarantino.  While there are times in this film when you will laugh yourself silly because of the realistic absurdity of some of the characters, you will also find yourself in awe with some of the honesty.  Jon Favreau is a gifted writer and as they say, you should write with what you are familiar with.  Swingers exemplifies the fact that he is very familiar with trying to break into Hollywood and how it feels to have the love of your life break up with you.  There is also a very clever scene where he is talking to his ex and she tells him that she is dating a guy named Pierre.  Is he french, Mikey wonders out loud to her. She tells him that he is not and I wonder if Favreau ever had that same question posed about himself with his last name.Not only is Swingers a wonderful film about the mysteries of women, it also has two incredible homages to Reservoir Dogs and Goodfellas and without even knowing it, Halloween as well ( Goodfellas and Halloween share a very similar shot.  Halloween at the beginning, Goodfellas in the restaurant ).And of course what has to be mentioned about this film is the language used by everybody.  Friends tell each other that they are gorgeous, that they are money and they refer to each other affectionately as baby.  It is so catchy that when I watched this with my fiancee she was in hysterics after five minutes and we were calling each other money for the next three days.
Swingers is one of the best films of 1996.  People that hold the lofty position of revered film critics and Academy members should realize these sorts of facts.  While perhaps films similar to this will never see their reward at the box office, it will see new life on video and perhaps more importantly, it will thrill and invigorate a generation of movie fans.""Your money baby!""Swingers certainly is!10 out of 10- This is not just a hidden gem, it is an excellent film and props have to be sent out to Favreau for writing this and Liman for directing it.  I really wish that Favreau would write more films.  He has a gift.  Swingers is a perfect example of that gift.One last observation: Check out the Sega hockey scene.  It is absolutely hilarious.  With all due respect to Gretzky, it is a treat to listen and watch someone make his head bleed ( in the game that is ).",Swingers
30,jaredmobarak,Mikey's all grows'd upSwingers,10,8 January 2007,"The early to mid-90s brought the world an insurgence of little indie films that could. Sure Clerks is looked upon as the movie that gave everyone the opportunity to say to himself, ""Yes, I can do it"", but it is really Swingers that showed what an indie film could do. Kevin Smith's debut was one made very much on the cheap with friends and non-actors waxing pop-culture philosophical. These guys were hilarious yes, but talented no. It was the witty banter, scripted by Smith, which gave that film its legs; the production values are low and the artistic quality little to none. Don't get me wrong, Smith is one of my favorite directors and I absolutely love Clerks. However, a movie like Swingers (ok, so it had a budget of $200,000 compared to $30,000 for Clerks, but still that is pennies in this industry) takes the idea of film-making on the go and runs with it so far that it looks almost Hollywood.Both of these films used a first time writer to be the backbone of the project. Like Smith, Jon Favreau crafted a script so real that it could have been completely ad-libbed. This film is the essence of life in Los Angeles with just dialogue. Much of the story takes place in the principals' apartments; these one-room homes could be anywhere, it is the words that tell the story, not the visuals. Even when the action goes to some of the hip clubs around town and a casino in Vegas, it was all shot by the director, Doug Liman, without emptying out the venues. These guys would come in and rope off half the bar saying that anyone on that side might be in a film. Swingers is guerilla film-work at its best, shooting when they can and where they can. All the sounds are unscripted, the lighting true, and the people local. Everything is so tangential, helping the movie succeed. We are watching a group of friends go about their lives on the prowl for alcohol, sex, fun, and love. This is probably the closest you can get to documentary without it being so.You have to love the way Favreau and Liman have allowed themselves to poke fun at their own on-going work too. Having a discussion about film costs and it being crazy to shoot a scene in a casino due to price, literally five minutes after they just shot in a casino is priceless. These guys love film and they bring that feeling to the work. It also doesn't hurt having a spectacular supporting cast of faces that had yet to make it big in the industry. Classic ""that guy"" Alex Desert, Ron Livingston before Office Space, and Heather Graham before Boogie Nights all help add to the flavor. Besides them and LA itself, (a gorgeous slide show of photos for the opening titles and little jabs at the city like the inability to carpool in case you have a chance to take a girl home), Swingers is also the launching of Vince Vaughn's hyper-comedy. The man puts this film on his shoulders and never lets it go. He is the best friend we all want. Sure he is a ladies man going off to get as many women as he can, but he will never leave a friend behind. It is his mission to get his bud back in the game and he will stop at nothing, even if it means his own love life suffering as a result. It was a star-making role that is so money I don't think he can ever top it. He'll get close, (Wedding Crashers for example), but the antics, attitude, and lovability here will not be beat. Vaughn is so good that, in only a few minutes, he was able to display the greatness that was EA Sports' NHL '96. The comradery, the skill, the gloating, and, of course, making Gretzky bleed for Superfan 99. You don't get better than this.",Swingers
31,mattymatt4ever,This movie is so money!,8,9 August 2002,"Before watching ""Swingers,"" I saw Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn paired off in ""Made.""  Now, I didn't like ""Made"" all that much, but that didn't lower my expectations when watching ""Swingers.""  I already knew the two actors had a great chemistry and as long as the script is well-written, they can really go places.  ""Swingers"" is a thoroughly original, wonderfully written comedy that's filled with big laughs.  Favreau and Vaughn's characters are like polar opposites, and it's hilarious to watch them argue.  The rest of the actors are also good (I think the black guy is the blind character from ""Becker""--I could be wrong), but Vince Vaughn steals the show as the smooth-talking Trent.  We all have friends like Trent.  Some of us aspire to be like Trent.  Some of us are Trent.  I admit, I would compare myself more to Favreau's character--the more reserved, sensitive type.  But the great thing about a film like this is it's down to earth.  It's about everyday people in everyday situations, and I guarantee many of us can relate to the characters in ""Swingers"" in one way or another, just like how many of us relate to the characters on ""Seinfeld."" This isn't a plot-driven film, so you can call this a movie about nothing. It's simply about a group of studs on the prowl, hitting the clubs and casinos, and sharing their philosophies on sex and dating.  There are several films that tried to replicate this format and failed (""Whipped"" comes to mind).  If you're in the mood to laugh hysterically and be wildly entertained, ""Swingers"" is the movie for you.  About my only criticisms would be a few lame attempts to be stylish.  Come on, would 5 guys really drive in their own cars and follow each other all the way without anyone cutting them off? 
My score:  8 (out of 10)",Swingers
32,hall895,So money,8,10 June 2013,"In addition to being a great, thoroughly enjoyable movie Swingers created its own language. Jon Favreau's script is filled with lines which make you laugh out loud even after you've heard them hundreds of times. And you probably have heard them hundreds of times because people just love quoting this movie. As well they should. Of course a great script is nothing without great performers who can turn what is written on the page into movie magic. And Swingers is blessed with a pair of performers who are absolutely perfect. One is Favreau himself and the other is of course the loud, boisterous, ultra-cool Vince Vaughn. There are a few other important performers, Ron Livingston and Heather Graham most notably having key roles to play. But the movie by and large belongs to Favreau and Vaughn. What a pairing. The back and forth dialogue between the pair absolutely sparkles and the two actors embody their characters so wonderfully. The result is a movie that is so money.Favreau plays Mike, a struggling comedian who recently moved across the country to Los Angeles. He broke up with his long-term girlfriend and to say he is having trouble letting go would be putting it mildly. His confidence is shattered, he has no success with the ladies. Vaughn plays Mike's friend Trent. This guy has no trouble with the ladies and he takes it upon himself to get Mike back in the game. With the rest of their group of friends Mike and Trent do all the things twenty-something guys do. They play video games, go to parties and bars, chase the honey babies. The contrast between Mike and Trent is always at the heart of the movie. And it is always hilarious. When looking for women Mike does everything wrong. Meanwhile Trent has women fall into his lap. You always sympathize with Mike. Who can't relate to this poor schlub? Meanwhile you always laugh with Trent. Every time the character opens his mouth comic gold spews forth. It is a very simple movie. In this case simplicity is a very good thing. The movie breezes by in a tight, fast-paced hour and a half. There are no lulls. The witty dialogue, and the great way that dialogue is performed, lets things keep crackling along. The movie has both a great look and sound to it, the Hollywood scene brought to bright and vibrant life with some great swing music. And the Hollywood theme continues with spot-on homages to some great films. Everything about the movie works. But the most important thing the movie has going for it is the tandem of Favreau and Vaughn, both so perfect for their respective characters. They give the movie its personality and what great personality indeed. Swingers is just about as much fun as a movie can be. Money.",Swingers
33,KnightsofNi11,This movie is so money!!!,9,2 August 2011,"Prepare for one hell of a ride when you sit down to watch Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn paint the town red in Swingers. Mike (Favreau) is a down on his luck actor and comedian who is heartbroken over his lack of contact with his girlfriend of six years. His best friend, Trent (Vaughn), tries desperately to help him out by taking him out on the town and getting him back in the game. The film follows Mike, Trent, and their other screwball friends as they invade the neo-lounge scene looking for chicks, booze, and a good time. It surely sounds like a dull concept that can't go anywhere, but with the fast driving dialogue and hip acting the film becomes a masterpiece of suave and a pitch perfect portrayal the Los Angeles night life.Slick, smooth, and suave. That's what Swingers is. But it's not a film that gets too wrapped up in itself and it never forgets that it is a comedy. And what a comedy it is! Even in its most seemingly sincere moments Swingers is still hysterical, whether through irony or satire. It's also a higher quality brand of humor. It is true wit and true intelligence used to get a big laugh. This is a movie where you have to be hip to pop culture as there are a lot of movie references and things like that. If you don't get the reference then you don't understand the joke, thus you feel left out. But if you are savvy with those types of things then you will surely love Swingers for all of its clever humor used in uniquely hilarious ways.This film really succeeds not because it is just really funny, but because it follows a golden rule of comedy. Characters. Most of the time the characters in a comedy will do certain things just to get a laugh and they are things no normal person would ever do. Rather than actual human characters they are more vehicles for ridiculous jokes and situations. Swingers, on the other hand, does not fall victim to this common comedy occurrence. What's so great about the film is that the characters are all so real and convincing. When I watch this movie I feel like I am watching Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn out at a bar enjoying themselves. The characters in this film talk, act, and interact exactly how you would expect a group of young guys like them to act. Nothing is forced or over the top in this movie. Swingers is a film that produces an uncanny amount of authenticity, with incredibly entertaining results.This is a film all about the characters and dialogue. If it hadn't hit those two elements right on the nose then it wouldn't be half the amazing film that it is. I loved every second of this 90 minute film and I'm sure I'll spend plenty of time quoting the movie, calling this and that ""So money!"" Seldom do you find comedies this smart and this hilarious at the same time. This film only furthers my longing to live in LA now that I've seen such a perfectly authentic portrayal of the bouncing and wild night life that Swingers details.",Swingers

But, I was 22 when I saw it, and I'm a guy, so it was definitely for me.Before I say what I'm just about to say, let me say that I've seen about 4,000 films, and my top ten is probably on par with many film- lovers of the same age I love ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"", ""Shawshank"", ""Raiders"", ""orig Star Wars Trilogy"", ""Unforgiven"", ""Wizard of Oz"", ""Pulp Fiction/Kill Bill"", ""Goodfellas"", etc Don't get me wrong, there are some of my 43 ""10's"" that are a bit out-of- the- box, like: ""Chungking Express"", ""Frantic"", ""Boyz in the Hood"", ""U23D"" but in general most of my ""10's"" are scored above 8.0 on here and universally liked.""Swingers"" is perhaps my favorite movie of all-time. Of course the environment where I saw it for the first time only enhanced the experience. In a town full of big theaters(CBus OH), only a small theater off campus called ""Studio 35"" was showing Swingers. My brother, the resident predictor of everything pop-culture told me I should check-it-out.Studio 35 is a steady angle theater with old short padded metal theater seats, sticky floors, with greasy slices of pie to eat and beer on tap. It's not the quietest or best place to see a movie, but somehow, on this occasion, it only enhanced the experience.Swingers is the epitome of bachelor/buddy flicks. No other movie taps into the young guy psyche like it does. Not Old School, not Superbad,not Bachelor Party, not American Graffiti, nothing! It launched the careers of Favreau, Vaughn, and Livingston(of Office Space fame).What makes it so great is that the writers(Favreau and Vaughn) were writing a story very near and dear to the own personal lives; the struggling actor in LA living most of their lives in speakeasy bars and diners.The writing is pitch-perfect. I still smile and laugh the whole way through - well, except the cringeworthy yet effective scene where Mikey keeps calling the girls' answering machine.It looks like a ""B"" movie. Not the best production value, but that's not what this film is about. It's about friends. It's about relationships and heartache. It's about facing your fears.The film has that certain something that I can't put my finger-on, but if I were trying I would point out the writing, the music, the light-hearted subject matter played with such honesty and realism..and the stand-out performances from it's young, future stars.You can just tell that everyone had fun making this movie.David Schwimmer made a very different movie that I think succeeded for many of the same reasons, ""Trust"". Schwimmer had great knowledge of the subject and it showed.Watch this special, intimate comedy that will forever be a cult-classic. For the '90s college people, the 'son's of the baby- boomers', if you will, it's pitch perfect. There's something very genuine about this.. no gimmicks.. just realistic.. side-splittingly hilarious and amazing chemistry...",Swingers
35,vostf,Community flick,2,19 September 2007,"This movie is dedicated to the audience that will feel close to the main characters. Well that could be great if the audience was not limited to a community of people living in LA. Away from the place to be where wannabes and losers walk and run in circles, there's not much to be interested in, there's no deep, universal attraction.It's not that Jon Favreau is not good but the character he wrote keeps whining the same way all along. That shouldn't be the main character, only a comic relief IMO. Vince Vaughn is great; it's just a pity that the movie is not more demanding, his character sillier.And obviously Doug Liman did a great job to bring an anecdotal script to life. It's certainly well shot, but there's not much substance to start with. Apart from the technical aspect of a shoestring production and that of scouting Vince Vaughn, the movie is pointless.",Swingers

38,raypdaley182,"Wow, this is awful beyond belief.",1,27 August 2006,"Actually this film scores a Zero. It's utter tripe, total excrement. There, I had to get that over and said.The only people I knew were Vince Vaughn and Heather Graham. I did know the guy playing Mike, but I never know his name. Isn't the black guy who ""didn't get the part in Deep Space Nine"" the same chap who plays the blind guy in the American sitcom Becker?.Basically this is a film with no plot, no storyline and nothing happening the whole time. Someone described it as a real guy movie? Dude, nothing happens in the film ever.We basically follow the life of a guy (who calls himself an actor and comedian but we never see any evidence of either) bitching about a relationship that ended over 6 months ago (get over it!), and his friends who just go out on the club and party scene to try and meet women - mostly with no intent to ever follow up.This film is described as an attempt to create a modern day film in the style of The Rat Pack. Which it doesn't do. The film really doesn't do anything. Even when Mike finally meets a girl in a bar (Heather Graham who looks stunning in the 1950's style hair, make-up and clothes) and his ex girlfriend rings him he ignores her to speak to Graham.We never find out what happens to either relationship as the film ends abruptly after a really awful scene in a diner where Vaughn thinks a women is coming on to him when she is actually entertaining her baby.There is no start, no middle and no end to this film. There is no film, but it still managed to go on for 1 hour and 45 minutes.Avoid this. I'd sooner see Best Defence or Ishtar, and they are bloody dire. So that's saying something. Even fans of Vaughn and Graham are advised to give this one a miss. How they ever sold the idea to a production studio or got anyone to finance this is beyond me.",Swingers

I don't mind retro, but this movement turns me off.  Still, as a guys romantic comedy, this is good.  As one critic said, this works because it understands most romantic comedy takes place before boy meets girl(in that respect, this movie reminds me of DINER, which was also a study of guys trying to relate to women, though that one was better).  Unlike many, I thought the answering machine scene went on too long, but otherwise, I liked Favreau(as everyone else pointed out, who can't identify with him?), and of course liked Vaughan a lot.

With a young cast of Vince Vaughan and friends it is fun to watch. In this story Mike is seeking to connect with his lost love of New York after moving to Los Angeles to pursue his dreams. Meanwhile his best friend Trent is teaching him the dating hints and how to be ""money"" to those around him. Money is a term that describes a cool Cat. With these lessons learned he then takes on the starlets of Hollywood. With the back drop of the sounds of Big Vodoo Daddy in tow, you can't but love the night of swing dancing and how the world is full of possibility once you get comfortable in your own skin. Swingers is one cool movie Daddio.",Swingers

42,bix171,Inconsequential,5,28 February 2002,"Jon Favreau stars as a jilted New Yorker who attempts to start a new romantic life in Los Angeles while pursuing his career as a comedian. He's mentored by best friend (Vince Vaughn) in the art of picking up women but proves to be tentative and clumsy. Favreau, who wrote the script, has a bad case of the Woody Allens and both his whiny acting and his morose writing owe Allen a great debt of gratitude. Though the film is intermittently funny (a bit concerning an answering machine works very well), director Doug Liman lets too many scenes go on far too long and both he and Favreau have trouble creating interesting supporting characters that could at least offset Favreau's inconsequence--every male seems to have one disconcerting character trait that renders him unpleasant. The total effect seems to be contrary to the filmmakers' intent: instead of getting under your skin, after a little while it starts to get on your nerves.",Swingers
43,CelluloidRehab,At least its not Goofy....,9,10 October 2005,"To adapt a quote from a Sally Struthers infomercial is the essence of this movie; ""Remember when we were single. Sure. We all do."" For me this is the quintessential singles/dating scene movie, for my demographic (namely 21-34 year olds dating in the 90's). That is probably why I can relate so well to its subject and why I like the movie so much (and why Saturday Night Fever is a good movie, but feels somewhat dated to me).The story revolves around Mike (Jon Favreau), his group of cohorts and their various adventures. Mike has lived most of his life in New York and has recently (6-12 months) moved to Los Angeles to get a boost in his career (he's a comedian). In the process, his relationship with his girlfriend of 6 years is terminated. So in essence we get the fish out of water story. Mike is in a new city, has a few friends, his career is slow and he can't seem to buy a date.His peers consist of the ""leader"" Trent (Vince Vaughn), a boy named Sue, Mike's ""Goofy"" friend from back east Rob (aka the guy from Office Space) and the guy who could have been Commander Sisko, Charles. Mike is the focus,however, and the group is his peer counsel.Mike seems to have trouble talking to women and can't seem to let go of his ex. Trent is constantly supporting him and encouraging him. This is by far, Vince Vaughn's best role and the prototype for most of the roles he has had since with the exception of Norman Bates (I'm not sure where he got the motivation for that). Trent is a player. He isn't the PG-13 guy, but rather the Rate R guy. He's likable without being the nice guy. Trent is the leader and he leads by example. He knows how to play the ""game"". He knows all the hidden rules, body language,etc of the dating game. He tries to impart some of that knowledge onto Mike. For the majority of the movie, Mike is just sulking or awkwardly trying to use what Trent has taught him. Its not the Mike is not experienced, he is just out of practice and not in touch with the LA scene. To quote Trent : ""You are so money"". Mike's quest is to gain the inner confidence to go with the ""money"" exterior. This is the hysterical ride of the movie.This movie is also a plethora of potent quote-ables : ""You're like a big bear man."" ""This place is dead anyway."" ""Our baby's all growns up now."" ""You're so money and you don't even know it."" ""I'm gonna make Gretzky's head bleed for super fan 99 over here.""""Always double down on 11."" This movie is all about the quotes. Some of the best dialog occurs between the characters. It is quite funny and sometimes true. You can't help but laugh and at the same time think (or say, or even take notes) ""yeah, that works"" or ""I remember when something like that happened to me"".Well as you can imagine, Mike eventually gets the confidence (through much trial and error) and starts getting the attention of the opposite sex. For me, the thing I will remember always, is ""not to be a Mike"". Namely, the scene in the movie where Mike calls Nikki and proceeds to leave messages on her answering machine. Never do this. And remember to wait at least 2 days before calling a girl you just met, always double down on 11 (blackjack), and VEGAS BABY!! VEGAS!!",Swingers

Comb your hair, go outside. I guess it's a tad inspirational but total zip on the educational quotient.Given almost 20 years of fermenting, I soured on Favreau's talent with such a sophomoric script. He was just aching to get even with the one who got away and it shows the deepest desperation and underhanded cruelty. Very disappointed that these friends were more like mooches, used each other, mostly ignoring their emotional needs.Having difficulty discerning why nothing really happens here, save the Gretsky blood battle. I decided to watch this after an interview with Favreau and Tim Ferris, where he unabashedly was disarmed at the cult status of the film. Not sure what planet he sustains himself but this um, status, in hind sight would be an embarrassment and only admonition could prove elevating.High recommend for mega juveniles who know nothing of LA.

It's pretty much a cult movie that could reach a wider audience because of its usage of great actors, both in the lead characters and the extra characters, and it's great touch of humor and reality.I gave it a 9. It's not so boring because the grip you get on their plight throughout Las Vegas and LA, which deals with getting acting deals, girls' numbers, and keeping your friends in check with reality, is entertaining, well-thought-through, and comedic. Great party film, as well.",Swingers
47,Mr. Pulse,A Movie of Subtle Charms,8,19 January 2001,"I own Swingers, but for a long time I didn't.  I saw it on video, enjoyed it as pleasant fluff and that was that.  But it's a movie that stuck in the back of my mind, and whenever I'd be at a video store I'd ask ""Have you seen Swingers?""  Sometimes to total strangers, but that's really another story. Anyway, the damn thing itched at me until I bought my copy.  Now I watch it every couple of months, and it's a film that gets better with each viewing.Don't misunderstand, I still think it's little more than pleasant fluff. But on repeat viewings you appreciate the subtle humor (This is a funny movie that doesn't have jokes in it), and the fine direction by Doug Liman, as well as the wonderfully personal script by star Jon Favreau.   You can tell that everyone involved in this movie cared about what they were doing.The supporting characters are all well observed and highly believable from the fish-out-of-water Rob to the wild-ladies-man Trent. 
Like another movie I enjoy very much, High Fidelity, this is a simple film in which the characters seem as if they are real people that one could bump into on the street.  That's a quality that's not often seen in films, and one that works even less of the time (Generally we go to movies for escapism).  In Swingers it does.  Again and again.",Swingers
48,goolizap,Twizard Rating: 97,10,19 February 2016,"The movie that made us know Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn will surely not disappoint. It's humor is unique to the two leads, and is organic in the sense that it hits home for them. They believe what's happening because they lived it.Written by Favreau and loosely based on he and Vaughn's life and friendship, Swingers is about a group of struggling actors who are involved in the '90s Hollywood swing revival. It follows Mike (Favreau), a New York native who can't get over his ex-girlfriend. But his friends, most notably Trent (Vaughn), try getting him out of his depression by forcing him back out onto the playing field.Both leads are fantastic. Vaughn wows the audience with his unique brand of fast-talking humor. And Favreau is so convincing as a wallowing sad sack that you genuinely feel bad for the guy.The scene towards the beginning where the pair of friends go to Las Vegas sets the tone for the entire movie. It establishes a style that is vehemently consistent throughout.Swingers has everything that will make you want to drive to Los Angeles and Las Vegas right this second. It ties together the glitz and glamor of both cities, seamlessly connecting the two. But I think what captures the neon vibe of the film's locations is the juxtaposition of failing to make it. This failure, of course, isn't stressed. It's still opportunity. It's optimism.Neither Mike nor Trent have had much success in the industry, but Trent is still having the time of his life, while Mike's only reason to be down on himself is his breakup. The film paints a perfect portrait of confident mediocrity, and being complacent with it.The story's exposition takes its time, but in a perfect way. Every scene has a sincere purpose and contributes to establishing the depth of its characters. But it's beyond just the characters. A movie is refreshingly good if even the circumstances have depth.

51,toll-8,How comedies should be done,7,26 June 2012,"Swingers is the story of four wannabe actors moving to New York and trying to make it big. The main thread follows that of Mike (Favreau) who had to break off a six year relationship in New York in order to move west and pursue his dream. Six months later and he is still distraught over the break up and his friend Trent decides to teach him how to get back in the game and become 'money' (irresistible to women) as he likes to put it. In doing this they travel to Las Vegas, back street Hollywood bars and parties up mountains where Mike manages to meet women and ultimately destroy any chance of a relationship in less than an hour. The film is very relatable for most men out there who lack the confidence when talking to women compared to Trent (Vaughn's) abundance of it.The film is written by Favreau himself and I have to say the script is fantastic. The dialogue really works for the film, and the performances and delivery of the lines by the actors really help the script look great. The story is paper thin and not much to it, but the dialogue within it is brilliant and very funny. One of the scenes involving Mike ringing a girl he met in the bar that night and leaving several messages as the machine keeps cutting him off is brilliant and had me laughing in hysterics. Many of the lines done this and it was a breath of fresh air for some of the comedies released now days. Writer's need to look back at this comedy to see how it should really be done.The performances in the film are good and are perfect for the tone of this movie. The dialogue must have been hard to learn as there are many occasions when people ramble on in a rant, which is all filmed in one shot. These moments fit the film really well, especially with many tracking shots that cut off peoples head and it is as if you are actually walking behind the actors. The camera work and cinematography isn't great but it works with the film so you can get over it. This is what is great about this film is that it looks low budget and very studenty but that is what makes it such a treat. I wasn't expecting much and found myself pleasantly surprised.When you watch this film, and I say when because you so should, you will be surprised to see a really young Vince Vaughn, and if you know him Jon Favreau, with them both looking the part as normal everyday guys. I think this is one of Vaughn's first films, before he really hit stardom, and it is plain to see why he was pulled into bigger roles as he is very funny here. Favreau, by all accounts, wrote this script based on his own experience of moving to Hollywood in search of stardom, and his friends who helped him through this time. Those friends were in fact Vince Vaughn and Ron Livingstone who portray themselves with different names in this film. This was how they all were and it is easy to believe that this could be the case, with the performances, camera work, script, and cinematography really keeping the film grounded. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this film. It isn't the best comedy I have seen but it is one of the better ones. I think it is due to it being so relatable and different to over blown comedies out there. The film has a lot of heart and you route for the characters throughout. We are even treated to a late cameo from Heather Graham, who despite her being a little more famous than the other actors at the time, doesn't seem out of place at all, and if anything adds something special to it. There is also a fantastic final scene which had me in stitches and wrapped up the change in characters completely. I advise you to go rent this film it is very, very good.3.5 / 5For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com",Swingers
52,Mr_PCM,A definitive and essential 90s film,9,5 January 2006,"First off, this film is ESSENTIAL viewing for any twenty-something male. Just needed to start with that.Swingers is probably the definitive sleeper/cult hit for non-geeks. It is also probably one of the most decade-defining films of the 90s. Now I realise that is a grand statement, but I also believe it is a justified one. It details the lives (or at least night lives) of a group of single twenty-something guys living in Los Angeles in the mid 1990s. They go out, get a little bit drunk and try to meet women, and it makes for some entertaining, but uncomfortably accurate viewing. All guys will recognise at least a part of themselves in one of the main characters; either the brash and extremely self-assured Trent or the sweet but very self-conscious and slightly needy Mike as they try, with varying degrees of success, to meet women and get them into bed.Mike (Jon Favreau, who also wrote the screenplay) has recently broken up with his girlfriend of six years and just wants her to call him. However his friend Trent (Vince Vaughn) is only interested in getting laid, as are their friends Sue (Patrick Van Horn) Rob (Ron Livingston) and Charles (Alex Desert). If any girls are curious as to what guys get up to and how they behave on a typical lads night out, here is a good example of their group dynamic. They're all on the pull, but they back each other up as well and encourage, congratulate or console each other when needed. But for guys, this is the perfect antidote to a chick-flick, without having to resort to a violent action or science-fiction film.The film is genuinely funny, but also by turns toe-curlingly embarrassing (Mike's early self-pitying and his one-way conversation/relationship with a girl's answering machine in the space of a few calls in a few minutes), possibly because at least part of it rings an uncomfortable note of truth. It's the film's unashamed honesty, coupled with a deep underlying almost child-like innocence at the heart of the main character as he tries to get over his ex that make the film a joy to watch.Swingers also created some extremely memorable and quotable dialogue, including 'Vegas baby', 'beautiful babies' and 'you're so money'. Also watch for a terrific speech from Trent, telling Mike to be the guy out of the R-rated movie, not the one from the PG-13 movie. It really captures the essence (if not the actual vocabulary) of how guys boost each other's confidence on a night on the town.This is one of my favourite films, not only because the story itself rings rather true and familiar with me, but also because I feel completely comfortable in the company of these characters on the screen. At the end of the day they are just a group of normal guys discussing normal guy things  girls, movies, girls, work, girls, bars, and girls. The characters feel real, not only because they are in an ordinary situation, but because they are a diverse group and have real depth. What I particularly love is how Jon Favreau's character discussing movies is mirrored in Favreau's scripting of the film; he cheekily manages to make homage-style references to other films. One of the best shots of the film is as the group sit round a table playing poker and comparing the merits of Quentin Tarantino's films, the camera pans round focusing on each of their faces, calling to mind the scene at the breakfast bar at the opening of Reservoir Dogs itself. He immediately follows this with a tongue-in-cheek shot of the guys walking down the street in the style of Madsen, Keitel, Roth et al in the same film. There is also a lovely tribute to Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas as they guys skip the queue at a club and enter through the back, passing through a series of kitchens and corridors, greeting the staff as they go  much like Ray Liotta did in the original film. These and other references are what make the film so fun. With these discussions of, and homages to movies, I feel right at home with these guys who so obviously share my interest.I cannot write a review of Swingers however without drawing reference to the soundtrack, which is a separate, vibrant entity. At the time of the film's release a revival of swing music was underway in America, and the clubs of this film echo the beginnings of this revival, showcasing some real neo-swing bars in LA that have gone on to become extremely famous. The music is fantastic and it is just a shame that the revival did not gather more pace in the wake of this film. However, the band playing in the final club, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, are one of the best examples of the neo-swing sound, and it was through them that I discovered I loved this kind of music. So for introducing me to them, I thank Mr Favreau.Although this was Favreau's film, Vince Vaughn was the real winner out of this, as a certain Mr Spielberg spotted him in this and immediately cast him in Jurassic Park: The Lost World, and he has never since looked back. And I defy anyone to not fall in love with Heather Graham in this film; any twenty-something bloke who says he doesn't is either gay, dead inside, or simply lying.Again, this film is essential viewing for any twenty-something male, and for anyone serious about being a movie nut.",Swingers

This is a great guys movie. Swingers is a label which you can call bunch of guys hanging out and flirting with chicks. They have a very high self-esteem and big mouths. And they look stylish. And they are. They're swinging.The story here concentrates on Mikey (Jon Favreau) who's having a difficulties to get over with a broken relationship. His friends try to help him. And there comes a lesson. It shows how important is to have a real friends around you. It's great to see that. The bunch of comedians (Jon Favreau, Vince Vaughn, Ron Livingston) are young here. And they offer more than one or two humorous scene.So if you're a guy over 20, you should see that movie. According to Trent (Vince Vaughn) 'you are so money that you don't know that'.

Homo Desperatus,8,20 July 1999,"The title of this film suggests to many the promise of many nubile, naked, open-minded, free-spirited nymphs looking for a night of romping sexual liberation.Sadly, this is not the case. ""Swingers"" is however a humourous peek into the male thought process in relation to the pursuit of the opposite sex. In essence, it's a real guys film, but the chicks dig it too.Some of ""Swingers"" finest moments are simple portrayals of the weakness and desperation of the single man who is trying to get over a break-up with a long-term girlfriend. His friends push and prod him into re-entering the meat-market of L.A. night-life and attempt to boost his waning self confidence, with little to no success.The making of this magical independent film is the stuff of fairy tales. The dream realization and star making of a number of gifted actors and filmmakers has transpired. Vince Vaughn is charming and convincing as the kind of guy who would take much pleasure from seeing his buddy getting laid and moving on. Jon Favreau is the pained, desperate victim of heartbreak and struggles to feel comfortable in the dating scene. Ron Livingston plays the truly helpful and sympathetic friend who knows what it's like to have loved and lost. All three of these fine lads have moved on to varying degrees of post-""Swingers"" success. I honestly can't say how much ""Swingers"" has done for the now superstar Heather Graham. In this one case, I believe she did more for the film than it did for her. Perhaps she has a different take on that, though. All I mean to say by that is, by the time this film was out, she was well on her way already.As for ""Swingers"" success itself, it has done tremendously well for a film financed by numerous maxed-out credit cards of cast and crew, (so the legend goes anyway). It's impossible to tell how many other films have been made in such a fashion and then not rescued or picked up by a distributor. It's kind of disheartening just to think of all the never-was'.

If you've ever been a lonely guy in a new city, you'll appreciate what the film is about. Instead of the character having a threesome with a nun and a dominatrix, he worries, he messes up, he fumbles. He's human. His friends are annoying. He reaches peaks and valleys.

The few really funny moments mired down in all of the pathetic lumberings of the main characters who are pretty much a bunch of losers.There is no apparent plot, which really keeps the pace of the film slow. And, as films are usually an escape for us, the events are too close to real life for comfort. The acting however, is superb, as the lead character Mike, pulls you down into his doldrums. Perhaps the plot of the film rings too true, as most of us can appreciate trying to get over a relationship, trying to 'swing' in the dating world, and getting along with your buds. Vince Vaugn certainly steals the show in this, as his character is the most interesting and animated.One is also preoccupied by the film apparently trying to be ambiguous as to the time it was taking place it. The characters drive old cars, wear 50's attire, speak in 50's lingo, but use digital answering machines, and a Playstation. One finds this to be more distracting to everything, rather that visually interesting. It also really highlights the fact that these characters are trying to be cool, something they are not.I was really expecting a comedy, but found it to be a drama with few funny moments.

This is probably the way a lot of guys of this generation think and operate, just like every previous generation had guys who thought they had to be hip, cool or ""money"" to feel good about themselves and impress each other and women. What I really liked about the film is how the guy who seems the most insecure on the outside, in pain and never refers to himself or anyone as ""money"". ( actually seems to cringe at the word) is the one who gets real and honest and subsequently meets a great girl. The final scene is great, Mike seems truly transformed and moving on in his life and there's his buddy Trent still playing his pick up games with a woman who in reality hasn't even noticed him. The disparity of the two men at this point is paramount. This movie is funny and contains material I think a lot of men can relate to, and whether intentional or not also contains strong commentary on how men deal with their feelings of inadequacy in life.",Swingers

This movie really opened my eyes about men and how they relate to one another and how they relate to women. As a younger woman I spent a lot of time, especially in the company of women, bashing men. The usual bravado of men are pigs and only want one thing.After watching this movie I felt ashamed of myself. This movie and my experiences online chatting with men have really opened my eyes to the fact that men have feelings that are just as valid as any woman's. I think because men don't express themselves women tend to think of them as unfeeling. Men get hurt in relationships to. On top of this little realization was also the fact that this movie is hilarious. I like the homage to the different directors. I loved the dialogue. This is a fun movie to watch. It's also got a lot of great one liners.",Swingers

65,bhicks56,"You are so money, and you don't even know it.",10,3 December 1999,"One of the weakest trends we've had in the nineties is the horrid return of swing music. I'm sorry, but I have no wish to jump into a zoot suit and jive and wail to rockabilly played by jerks whose minds are lost in an era when they never even existed. Nostalgia is one thing, but can we move on TOWARDS the future as the millennium closes?I think Doug Liman's kicky, clever nightlife movie SWINGERS is somewhat guilty of pulling underground swing music into the mainstream (it launched Big Bad Voodoo Daddy into a brief success on MTV and music catalogs), but who cares. Jon Favreau gives us a story that's funny and so true of men, no matter what their taste of hip is.Jon Favreau plays Mike, a comedian from New York who now resides in sunny L.A. and slumps into the depressing stages of being dumped by his long-time girlfriend. It's funny watching other people's reactions to him. Either you think he's a chump or a really sweet guy. He is, honestly, the latter, because you are either the kind of guy who wants true love in a relationship or a long list of digits from girls you met at a club just so you never have a boring night without sex.The foil is Mike's best bud Trent (showstealer Vince Vaughn) who desperately tries to get Mikey back in the game. Trent drags Mike to Las Vegas in one of the movie's best scenes.The main point of this film is to show the nightlife rituals of young single men. To show their real feelings under a slew of masks they wear just to attract some pretty babies. Oh, and Jon Favreau's script is chopfull of hip lingo from Swingers sub-culture: ""money"", ""babies"", etc. Most of it sounds like oldskool hip-hop slang (i.e. the Nike commercials with Spike Lee and Michael Jordan), but whatever. This film rocks.And it's not just the screenplay. Doug Liman has a flare with his optical lens as he paints the town of Los Angels, adding so many in-jokes and smirky, sharky point of view shots. There's also an appearance from Heather Graham (post-DRUGSTORE COWBOY, pre-BOOGIE NIGHTS) near the end in a sweet, lovely role no matter how small.This is a good movie to watch with the guys, but probably (in a strange way) makes an even better date movie with your own personal baby. Are better still, if you can't stay still on the couch, check out the nearest bar and nightclub to get your game on. Just watch out for the old couple live entertainment playing ""Staying Alive"" out of tune.",Swingers
66,Ryan_9,Money!,9,14 December 2020,"""Swingers"" was a fun movie to watch. It was entertaining and had a good plot. Jon Favreau (Mike Peters) and Vince Vaughn (Trent Walker) were hysterical together and had great witty dialogue. Rob (Ron Livingston), Sue (Patrick Van Horn), and Charles (Alex Desert) were good supporting characters. The movie itself was hilarious and had a lot of funny moments. The scene where they're playing NHL was the best and a realistic portrayal of how intense playing video games can be.Mike was a character guys could relate to and developed well throughout. In the beginning, he was shy, distraught, and doubtful due to the breakup, but as the movie progresses, he regains his confidence and realizes that he is, in fact, ""money."" I liked the homage to ""Goodfellas"" when the guys enter through the back of the club and the use of the Steadicam.
I also liked the use of the song ""Go Daddy-O"" when Mike and Lorraine are dancing as it was catchy and fit the mood of the scene.Overall, I'll give ""Swingers"" a 9/10. Great guy film!",Swingers

I guess some find it fun, per other reviews, but it's not a broad comedy with broad appeal. The humor will only be found by people with certain taste. I found the movie long, drawn out, and unfocused. There are some interesting performances, however, by much younger Favreau and Vaughn, especially, but overall it is more a movie about lost people trying to escape into adventure and fun. I suppose people of a certain generation can relate to that point in their lives, but overall, I don't think it has much to say or much depth to it. It is what it is, but certainly not the kind of movie I will keep coming back to. Vaughn and Favreau have both done much better, more entertaining fare.",Swingers

The film concentrates on his friends attempts to get him back into the swing of things.Favreau who also wrote the script gives such a lovely performance that you can't help rooting for him even if he is a loser. His friend Trent (Vince Vaughan) is a much more confident guy and is one of the most likable guys you will ever see in the movie. Swingers made Favreau and Vaughan stars and it's not hard to see why.The movie references are a plenty. Reservoir Dogs, Goodfellahs, Jaws. And all this adds to the LA feel. Not every actor has it easy but they can dream of starring in the best parts. One of the swingers gets to dress up as Goofy at Disneyland. It's not really an acting part but hey, it's Disney.It's a guy's romantic comedy and I don't know would girls get it. But for guy's it's a must see.

75,superscal23,The most likeable characters since Butch and Sundance,10,17 April 2003,"Swingers is my favorite movie of the 90's.  Some people see themselves in Westerns, or in a police shootout ending of an action film, or getting the girl at the end of a romantic comedy.  I see myself playing video hockey with Mike, Trent, and Sue.  These are the most real, normal characters that have appeared on film in a long, long time.  I would venture to say that every man can relate to these characters in one way or another.  Maybe we don't all play video hockey, or swing dance, or live in L.A., but the bond between a group of guys just being guys is universal.  The reason that this is illustrated so well in ""Swingers"", as everybody knows by now, is that these are real life friends acting out their own personal experiences. If you're a fan of this movie, you owe it to yourself to purchase the special edition DVD and watch the commentary with ""Vince and Favs"".  Hearing them tell the real life stories behind the best scenes in the movie is definitely worth it, even if you're like me and already had the original ""Swingers"" DVD with no special features.  Is there a better description of a movie geek than a person who wants to go to LA to hang out with the stars of their favorite movies?",Swingers
76,mattdvs,"Hi Michelle? It's me, Mike...",10,1 August 2001,"Proof positive that a film does not need a huge budget or a name cast to be great.  I first saw this film about 4 years ago and it has remained, since that day, one of my favorite films.  Jon Favreau's script is nearly flawless and infinitely quoteable (You're money, baby!).  This is a film that knows it's main audience will be single guys, and therefore rewards us with very realistic characters that are easily related to.  Who among us has not experienced  similar situations to Mike's answering machine relationship breakdown?  I can't even watch that scene because it's too tragic and heart-wrenching.  This is a film that I'd describe as a realistic comedy. So many ""comedies"" today feature totally unrealistic situations that are totally contrived that they lose the feeling that the characters are human. ""Swingers"" is a comedy, don't get me wrong, but kick-to-the-gut scenes like Mike's breakdown give the human touch that actually makes laughing in the right spots easier.  By the end of the film, you feel satisfied because you haven't just watched some vapid, shallow comedy, but rather you've seen a film where you genuinely care about the characters, because you've seen them at their best and worst.",Swingers

I love how this movie is only about real life, and how perfectly Favreau's script captured the ups and downs of romance, the pointless conversation of male friendship, and the simple bonding experience of playing NHL '95. The dialogue feels so real that you feel like Sue, Mike, Rob and Trent are the guys you hang out with. Favreau is good, but Vince Vaughn really shines here. This is his breakout role, and it is completely brilliant. This movie is a lot better than what some of the jerks who've dismissed it on this page think it is. Ten out of ten.

People who were trying to break into the entertainment business in the 90's, who were around the age of the characters in the film and were living in LA.To me, I can't really relate to any of the characters either through personality or in the way they hit on girls, or just went out to have fun. I feel like Judd Apatow may have taken quite a bit of influence from 'Swingers' even though to me, a lot of the relationship type themes and scenarios in Apatow's work is easier for me to relate to.'Swingers' has many funny, funny moments. Good pacing (for an 'about nothing film', my fave by FAR being 'Dazed and Confused'), and although Mikes characters actions made me go 'What ARE YOU DOING??' at times, like when he started talking about his ex to the girl in Vegas, or when he called Nikki over and over again, or at all ON THE NIGHT HE MET HER. It is still realistic, there are obviously people that are like that, so it frustrating in an endearing way....and I guess it's what brings the laughs most times.The chemistry between the actors is it's strongest point. There really isn't much to fault with the film. But at the same time there's not too much that REALLY appeals to me in a personal sense, and thats were films like this really stand out.8/10 (Reviewed after 4+ viewings, although first time in 7ish years, so I couldn't remember much at all)",Swingers
80,superjxiv,One of the best written movies ever,10,21 February 2001,"First, let me give you a scene from Doug Limen's ""Swingers"". Mikey, Trent, Sue, Rob and Charles are single actors trying to make it big in Los Angeles, but tonight they're playing poker and talking about their favorite movies before a night on the town. They talk about unforgettable moments like the kitchen follow-though shot in Goodfellas and the slow motion opener to Resevoir Dogs. One person comments ""you gotta be nuts to shoot in a casino.""The brilliance of the writing lies in the subtext. All three of these scenes play out elsewhere in the film. At the beginning, Trent and Mikey are at a casino in Vegas; at the end, Trent, Mikey and Sue go to a club, entering the club through the kitchen; and immediately following the aforementioned poker game, the whole gang walk to their cars in slow-motion.With a script so self-aware of its surroundings, how can we go wrong?The story is focused on Mikey, as he tries to deal with the single life after a six year relationship ended aburptly after he moved to LA. He's been single for awhile, but he's still heartbroken and can't even look at another girl without thinking about his ex. Enter Trent, his friend and guide to the LA dating scene. Trent uses slang that is so addictive, I don't know anyone whose seen the movie and hasn't adopted phrases like ""beautiful babies"" and ""you're so money."" It's Trent's personal mission to break Mikey away from his tedium.Another moment of great writing: Mikey is apprehensive of approaching a girl who was obviously flirting with him. Trent takes him aside and gives him this pep talk: ""I don't want you to be like the guy in the PG-13 movie, you know, the one everybody's REALLY hoping makes it happen . . . I want you to be like the guy in the rated R movie, the guy you're not to sure about, you're not sure where he's coming from, you don't what to think . . . "" What an amazing allegory to Mikey, who is from a PG-13 movie, and Trent himself, the epitome of the rated-R bad ass.If you watch closely enough, if you look between all the parties and video games and bad golf, Mikey slowly progresses. It's an uphill battle, and Jon Favreau plays him with complete realism. As Mikey looks at the pictures of his ex after a long night, tears swell in his eyes. It's not really crying, its trying so hard not to cry that it happens anyway, a method Trent mentions while telling of his auditions.There is nothing not to like about this movie. In the final stroke of genius, as Mikey attempts to tell Trent his sublime moment of clarity, Trent interrupts him to flirt with a girl at the far end of the restaurant. Trent bellyflops, and tries to return to the conversation. Mikey simply gazes out of the window, with a very clever smile. End of film.10 out of 10.",Swingers

He was very good in ""Return to Paradise"" and I loved his character in ""Clay Pigeons"".  Doug Liman has been able to back up ""Swingers"" with another movie, highly underrated, ""Go"". Jon Favreau has yet to find that good movie role because ""Very Bad Things"" was very bad.  I did like his cameos in ""Friends"" so lets hope that his movie ""Marciano"" does well for Shotime.  As for ""Swingers"" I got three words ""Get a nightlife.""  What a tagline, perfect for the movie.  Doug Liman does a great job directing this group of talent.

And, although the film is not directed by Favreau himself, his involvement was such that he made it into an instant financial and critical success- An unveiling vehicle who made the career of Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn which turned them into a lucrative couple in the same manner as Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. Swingers follows in a very realistic manner the lives of single, unemployed would be actors throughout the early 90's. Coincidentally, a swing and blues revival period. Main leads, Favreau and Vaughn, play Mike and Trent, two friends who also happened to be the central characters of the film. Mike, the latest arrival of the group to Los Angeles has broken up with his girlfriend of six years and is still having difficulties moving on.

Jon Favreau has such a sympathetic air around him that you constantly want to see everything work out for him, just like those guys in the PG-13 movies.

89,svswinger-2,As enjoyable as any film in recent memory.,10,24 November 1999,"I think a few of the readers who have commented on this film seem to be missing the point. While it can be said that this movie has no plot to speak of and no central point to it, my response is: so what? Not every movie is made to teach you how to live your life. Some of us can watch a movie simply for the pure enjoyment of listening to characters interact. Swingers does a better job of achieving this than the majority of movies ever made. Anybody can make Godzilla or Independence Day, but it takes a truly special movie to become a ""cult hit"" with nothing more at it's disposal than no-name actors (at the time) and catchy dialogue. This movie was the springboard for virtually every actor in it, with each going on to more well known parts.Ok, enough preaching, pure and simple this movie is great. Vince Vaughn's character is one of the most likable characters you'll see in a movie. Even if you have nothing in common with someone like him, you can't help but like him. He's hilarious, smooth, and a loyal friend, and he has some of the most quotable lines in the movie. Everyone else on this site has quoted it time and again, so no need for me to, but let's just say it's funny stuff. John Favreau's character, Mikey, makes you laugh while at the same time wanting to slap him for being so stupid. There's so many funny scenes in this movie, I can't even begin to describe them. But the best by far always involve Vaughn, and the part where he's in the trailer describing his experience auditioning for a pilot is classic. You know he's feeding the girls a line the whole time, but it's so convincing and everyone is so in awe of him, it's hysterical. And when Mikey tries to act cool in front of the waitresses they meet, and fails to do so, only to see Trent tell them he's a producer and watch them swoon, I can't see how people don't find that funny.Anyways, if you haven't seen this movie yet, do yourself a favor and go rent it.

Every so often there was a scene that raised the stakes a little, like the caravan foursome scene early on - no, not one of those foursomes - which is why I gave the three.I wanted it to deliver but the dialogue was flat and, to be generous, the characters mainly unconvincing. The woman with the cigar I thought may blossom into something, likewise the waitress at the casino, and a few others, but they were left for dead and Trent lived on... yawn.Mike was okay in some ways, but at the end it seemed all his potential had been wasted too and I was left feeling I'd been taken on a long ride to nowhere and back. Now I often love movies of everyday life where there is little in the way of fast action and no dramatic conclusion, but they have to engage me in some convincing interactions with well acted characters of depth. Swingers didn't do this by a long way.The filming and production felt choppy and disconnected. The acting was B movie Hollywood. Maybe it reflects real life in Hollywood? Maybe its a film for a young male age group? Not for me. And what was that gun scene about?! Inane.",Swingers
97,renchloctc,One of the best comedies ever,10,1 August 2002,"This comedy made me laugh out loud from beginning to end. Trent (Vince Vaughn) is the funniest character i've ever seen in a movie. This is a great comedy because the situations the characters get in are realistic. This movie isn't about shock value  and gross out tricks. Its a movie regular guys can relate to. They made me laugh about how they basically have a guide to approaching females.. and how they have rules on how long to wait to call a girl when you get her number. There is  a classic scene where Trent talks trash on his friend when he scores on him in a hockey video game. I've seen ""Made"" than John Favreau wrote also. I thought that was great and they both worked good in that but after seeing ""Swingers"", I went to my computer i gave it a 9 out of 10. I rank this among my favorite comedies . Rushmore, The Jerk, Stripes, Ace Ventura, What about  Bob and now Swingers is among my list. Please rent, buy or borrow off a friend and never give it back. Great film about friendship, moving on to better things and the club scene.",Swingers

For me, it shows one of the biggest hardships that a guy can face, namely women. The movie itself is like a testament to guys everywhere. Whether it be scouting the nightclubs, lookin for beautiful babies, or just hanging around the house playing hockey on your old Sega Genesis. You can relate with the film in one way or another. The acting is truly splendid. It's almost as if this film is a documentary, solely in the fact how convincing the performances are. Especially Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau....for this is still their best work. Humor and friendship has never been so cleverly displayed.Bottom line....and I think I speak for many in saying this.....IT'S MONEY BABY!!!!",Swingers

The lines and vocabulary have been used within my group of friends for years now, and quoting the movie never gets stale (the key is moderation!).

101,macvader999,favreau's best?,10,11 November 2006,"If you're a fan of jon favreau or vince vaughn then watching swingers is a must. The film, written by favreau, follows aspiring comedian Mike Peters (favreau) and some of his buddies after they move from New York to Hollywood, hoping to make it big. The change of scenery proves not to be as fruitful as peters had hoped. In fact, after six months he still hasn't been able to land a good gig and, also, can't seem to get over Michelle (his ex-girlfriend of six years). In order to to get Mike back in the game, Trent (Vaughn) forces him to go out to the bars and even to Las Vegas during the middle of the week. All in all, I enjoyed a favreau script that was filled with countless quips and great dialogue almost as much as the acting. A young Vince Vaughn steals the show with a breakthrough performance as the humorous and energetic Trent, a role quite similar to the one he played in Wedding Crashers. In addition, Ron Livingston is excellent in a supporting role as Rob, who Mike often turns to for guidance with his women problems. So, if you're looking to watch a movie with witty writing, solid acting, and a lot of laughs then Swingers should fit the bill.",Swingers
102,Arkinese,You are so money...,10,28 April 2000,"This is such a fabulous movie.  The first Vince Vaughn movie I ever saw was ""Clay Pigeons"" and I claimed that I would never see another movie that he starred in.  Then, a bunch of my male friends talked me into seeing this one, and now of course, I absolutely love Vince Vaughn.This movie has to strike a certain chord to appeal to you, but if it does, then you will always enjoy it.  I've had people  tell me that it's a dumb movie, that it's stupid, and I refuse to believe it.  Because of the superbly-crafted script, the immensely talented acting, and the general attitude of the entire show, Swingers is untouchable.  It is so absurd but so off-the-cuff that it oozes charm and humor.I think the type of people to whom it appeals are the people, both male and female, who have observed groups of twenty-something guys for extended periods of time.  I know that this was one of the main reasons I loved it. I've seen guys go through exactly what Mike, Trent, et al., go through in this movie.  They have their ingenious schemes to attract women,  their allotted number of days before calling someone, their inside catch-phrases, the walk, the talk... it's all there.  And you can tell that even though Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau themselves may even believe in some of the things their characters do, they also see the humor in Mike and Trent and the relationships that they and the other men have.My roommate claimed that this was one of the dumbest movies she ever saw. My boyfriend shouted at the TV when Mike checked the clock at 2:32 a.m., yelling ""Don't call her!!"" before Mike even reached into his pocket to get Nikki's phone number.  He was rolling on the floor laughing the entire time and I will definitely side with his view of this movie.  I would recommend it to anyone.""You are so money and you don't even know it...""",Swingers

I can't even count on two hands how many times I heard these two words...in a sentence...together.Besides this...minor gripe, Swingers was an average comedy. Vince Vaughn is kind of annoying in here, he's just a little know-it-all and he always seems to get under my skin. However, he played his part perfect as a scumbag.The main character Mike (Jon Favreau), is almost unbearable to watch. He is so incredibly awkward, I can't help but feel horrible for this guy. And although I am sympathetic to his background story, his overall weirdness just didn't earn any brownie points with me.The supporting cast is ""blah"" as well, but I do feel like Heather Graham was a standout. She brought a tad bit of class to the film.Swingers has its moments where you can't help but laugh, but most of the dialogue is unimportant blabber on behalf of Vaughn...I'd give Swingers an ""A"" for effort, but it was definitely a sub-par comedy. (I also found it strange how basically every scene with Vince Vaughn and another man in it -- the other man always seemed to be all up on Vaughn...kinda strange.)",Swingers

Low budget, niche film, young actors, acute dialogs, a successful recipe. Who has never suffered from love? Who has never dreamed to became an actor? Who has never experimented an hard landing? Swingers is this: cocktails, dreams, problems and friends. And where did Mike & Trent try to solve their problems? In Las Vegas! A cool city, a mix of people, lights and moneys. But the happiness is not there, every place, every pub, every parties quoting Charles ""...Is dead anyways"". Why? Because, basically, love lacks. But not dreams and hopes.

105,faded_Glory,Tedious and annoying,2,2 June 2005,"I really don't understand why so many people think this movie is fun. I thought it absolutely boring, annoying and utterly tedious. After plodding through the first 30 minutes or so I zapped to some of the remaining scenes in the hope to catch at least one funny moment, but nothing there, so I switched it off. I will now write this review and then erase it from my memory forever.This is not a film but an extended sitcom episode full of the worst of the genre. The only reason I give it more than 1 star is that Thank God at least they didn't include canned laughter.The characters are ultra boring, their conversations are empty, flat, repetitive, decidedly non-funny, and annoying to the point where you cover your ears to avoid screaming . There is no plot, no development, no humour whatsoever. Just to take the Vegas casino scene - it is so predictable, so obvious, so slow, so pathetic in its painful attempts to scream in our faces 'Look How Funny I Am!' that I felt personally insulted. And all that after first having to sit through an endless scene where the guys sit in the car on the road to Vegas and basically do nothing else but repeat the word 'Vegas' a million time in the same droning voices. Yeah, I really needed to see that.Is this humour? It feels more like a permanent hangover. Get a life.fG",Swingers
106,BobMustgrave,Everything I love about independent film,10,15 January 2009,"Swingers is one of my favorites of all-time, and the first movie I actually purchased on DVD, and I hold it dear to this day. What ""Sex and the City"" has done for women as far as expressing the underlying feminine reality of modern day city gals, ""Swingers"" does the same for men and maybe even exceeds these myths. It provides a certain truth about what it is that guys do when being guys and what it is that guys think about for that matter when not drooling over a half-naked female in a halter top and leather pants ensemble at some trendy hot-spot on Melrose. The script is top notch, all of the comedy plays, and as far as acting is concerned; all of the characters in the movie are late 20 something guys looking to become future actors in Hollywood (ironic, eh?), and they are outstanding. The flick is well written, well acted, well done and clever as can be, but best of all, it is absolutely horrible shot. Probably one of the worst shot films in the history of the medium. And thats it's most charming attribute. 70% of it is out of focus, and the other 30% is mis- framed, yet the editing is so genius, and the characters are so entertaining, that the storytelling overrides all of the formal inadequacies.And that's what independent film is all about; find a great story, try to tell it in a unique and interesting manner, f*ck it up a bunch along the way, and if it's truly good enough, let it stand on it's own two feet.I applaud this movie's existence.",Swingers

The first 20 minutes had me going as i was getting into the swing of things but the movie just appeared to drag on and on and half way through the movie i simply didn't care. The acting is spot-on and the chemistry between the two main characters is unique, what this film lacked was it's storyline.Swingers dragged on so much that i nearly drifted off into a deep sleep, and this was half 2 in the afternoon. I turned the film off after an hour, hugely disappointed and in disbelief that this was the film that made these two actors who they are today.Swingers may be fun for a lot of people but it certainly wasn't for me, and it has been one of the most disappointing films i have seen for a long time.",Swingers

I keep it on top of my ""stack"" and whenever I feel totally light-hearted, I pop it in.I had never even heard of this until a few years ago, when my brother turned me on to it. I am sure their marketing budget was as borderline as the one for production, so that might be the reason. No matter. Now that I know about this gem, I'm set.All the main characters were believable and totally understandable, in spite of the somewhat quirky world in which they lived. I could certainly identify with most of the main bits in this movie as I am sure a lot of guys do, and of course that is what makes you bust a gut.""There's nothing wrong with letting the girls know that you're money, and you want to party.""Or being either awkwardly stuck with ""the other one"", or getting (or giving) ""the tour"".Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn were fantastic. Favreau played the part of Mike, a sad sack who's really only being kept alive by his friends, and he did it to a tee. Of course, the truth is that these friends all needed support, and their brotherly love was pretty cool. They weren't comfortable in places where there was so much going on that you practically needed to bring your own oxygen. ""This place is dead, man"", Charles (Alex Desert) uttered more than once. They needed calmer places like The Dresden or even The Derby, that they could navigate. That was another aspect that rang true to me.Trent (Vaughn) was basically the leader, although despite the slightly better handle he had on the situation, he was still as vulnerable as the rest.I was almost embarrassed that I was smiling so much when Mike and Lorraine (Heather Graham) got together. The scene where he first met Lorraine, while Trent and Sue (Patrick Van Horn) sat blubbering in the booth, was an absolute classic! ""God bless that kid!""I thought that Lorraine's character was a perfect match for Mike and that made the ending all the more satisfying.You also can't beat Mike's phone messages to Nikki earlier in the film. If something similar hasn't happened to you at least once, you haven't lived.This flick is ""money"". Run out and get it and lighten up your life.",Swingers

All guys will end up liking this movie.  I imagine that some girls will like this movie, because they can see what guys are thinking.  The movie made me think a lot about how real life it is.  I'm 10 years younger then most of the late 20 year old actors in the movie, but I've already experienced some of the issues that Swingers dealed with. The dating, the wondering when you should call a ""beautiful baby"", how to talk and how to act.  The friendship that Mike has with different types (Trent, Rob, Charles, and Sue) shows how guys that at times don't have much in common can interact and be friends.  The scenes where Mike tells a joke that isn't that funny is so sad, but so real.  Any guy will admit they've told a stupid line to a girl, and wished they could have taken it back.  The dialogue is witty and fresh.  The monologue which Mike explains to Trent about why he doesn't like the girl's at clubs and bars had me rolling. Trent's pep talk to Mike about being the guy in the rated r movies is also one of the best parts of the movie.  This movie is more real then the blair witch project, and 100 times better.

The writer of this film felt that instead of a coherent story line, he'd use toilet-based, rock-jock jokes, tetosterone laced bumbles and moron antics to weave a nothing of a story about wannabe actors attempts to cheer up a friend whos 6-year relationship just went belly up. Yawn! So without a story, without any likable characters, without inspired directing, without talented cast and crew the viewer is left with celluloid trash!

I'm not saying it was the best, most artistic, original, or most innovative...but it is my favorite.  It's a movie about a 20-something man getting over a nasty break-up, living in Los Angeles.  Pretty simple stuff, but the honesty in the film is amazing.  This film boasts the most realistic, and interesting depictions of male friendship I've ever seen. Some might simply pawn this movie off as a buddy flick, but it goes so much deeper than that.  Mikey (Favreau) deals with insecurity, rejection, depression, an overwhelming feeling of inadequacy.  Something almost everyone can relate to.  And, as an audience member, you live and die with the poor guy.  The supporting cast is very strong, popping in and out as the assortment of friends populating Mikey's social life.  Each is trying, in his own way, to get their buddy out of his post-break up funk, which meet with varying degrees of success.  Swingers is chock full of laugh-out-loud moments, and oft-quoted lines (""Our baby's all grows up!"") that could very easily lead to repeated viewings of this masterpiece.",Swingers

The characters in Swingers throw around slang and profanity like they're talking another language - only a film like this could use the word ""money"" as an adjective. It brings a very cool vibe to the movie and that's why the movie works. Well, that and the fact that Sega Genesis NHL Hockey is heavily featured. ""I'm gonna make Gretzky bleed!""Both Favreau and Vaughn stand out with their performances as the sad-sack Mike and the ultra-hip Trent, respectively.  The surrounding cast also works well, but if you're onto this one for Heather Graham, she's only in it for a few minutes.Vaughn's performance alone makes this movie a keeper.

At the pleading of my friend (a girl none the less) we took a second look.  As the movie went on, our laughs got bigger and bigger.  The great part of this film is how well it captures each character and makes you feel almost as if you are part of the group.  Sitting around playing sega, early mornings in the all night diner, 5 separate cars to the party, the little subtleties of a group of bachelors to which we can all relate.  Vince Vaughn does an excellent job as the smooth talking player of the bunch, but the character I most relate to would have to be Mikey.  Jon Favreau does a great job playing, as far as I can tell, himself.  You can see that his heart is just a little too big to be a player like Trent, but his frustration in not being able to let go of his ex-girlfriend and sweet talk the ladies is painfully evident, especially in one scene where about everyone in the room started yelling at the TV, one of my friends hiding his eyes.

So, if you really want to go into the movie knowing absolutely nothing, you may not want to read further.Swingers is the kind of movie that you can watch over and over again just because of the vibe it sends out during its duration.  You watch Mike and Trent and the rest of the guys hanging out all the time, bulls****ing, playing Sega Genesis, talking about and trying to pick up girls and you automatically relate to them (well, the guys in the audience will anyways). Think about how you feel after just lounging around with your friends, talking about nothing in particular and then calling it an early night. That's exactly how you feel after watching Swingers. It has one of the great anti-climactic endings of all time, as well as one of the funniest scenes that I have ever seen in a movie (answering machine sequence).  The characters are surprisingly complex for a film of this type.  Trent is the perfect example of the asshole friend that you hang around with all the time, but you don't know why. And Mike is the textbook down on his luck, wrapped up in a depressing love, sidekick that Trent loves to first belittle and then console.Overall...great movie...very cool...very entertaining...highly recommended.",Swingers

I first saw this film in 1998 as a buddy of mine brought it home from the video store when I was trying to get over a girl. It worked!  Five years later, finding myself in the same predicament, I go to the video store- it worked again!What could be justly labeled a step-by-step video on social aptitude in the new millenium, ""Swingers"" lays out the guidelines for today's single man. How long do you wait before calling a girl whose digits you just got?  How do you wing your boy?  What are the perils of decending to ""teddy bear and ice cream"" discussions with a girl?  Why do you want to be the guy from the R-rated movie instead of the guy from the PG-13-rated movie guy?  How do you succeed in showing a girl how money you really are?  Favreau's script provides these and many other useful tips for the modern male hoping to survive life in the dating scene.Favreau's character, Mike Peters, is an aspiring actor who works an open-mike night at a local comedy club.  Moving to L.A. from Queens to help himself get over his girlfriend of five years and seeking fame, Mike is down--really down--by his inability to shake her from his system.  The melancholy romantic is consoled by his friend from back home in Queens, Rob (played by ""Office Space"" star Ron Livingston); but it is the antics of his savvy and street-wise sidekick Trent ""Tee"" Walker (masterfully played by Vince Vaughn).With T-bone's coaxing and pushing, Mikey is forced back into the dating scene.  Rusty at first, he eventually learns to cope and the film culminates in an impressive dénouement and an ending that has me on the edge of my seat, my eyes a-glow and my fists clenched in victory.This film is full of cinematic treats as well.  From Scorcese and Tarantino parodies that follow discussion of the two directors to a cruise down the Vegas strip to walking shots through Hollywood clubs, Swingers has the feel of a late night at a club or an evening at home with the boys playing hockey on Sega Genesis.  Other interesting and original eye-candy is to be found in the repetition of ""the Club"" in everyone's car, in the way each key player drives his own car in an almost funeral procession way and in the form of a communicable answering machine.  Although often--erroneously--labeled asrealistic or retro, the formalistic traits of this film are quite amusing and worth looking out for.In the end of the day, Swingers is an exceptional film--entertaining from start to finish, smart, classy and all a man needs to succeed in today's dating world.  The film leads you--or at least me--to re-evaluate things and realize how money you really were all along.  And the hope is rejuvenated: somewhere in some smoky, swing club is a beautiful baby--my Heather Graham--waiting for me at the end of the bar.",Swingers

Most people in high school / college had this smooth talking guy who always seemed to know where the party is and how to get the girl's number. He's a mile-a-minute jester who is trying to get a girl and be a good friend to Mikey (Jon Favreau). Mikey's phone call late at night to Niki just has you dying. For every guy who ever was lonely and ""weak"" -- that scene should be the wake-up call of your life.Some of the greatest one-liners are from that movie -- ""You're money, baby!"" -- Buy the DVD and keep it in your library for when your guy friends break up and need to go to ""Vegas Baby!""",Swingers

The moral and lessons of this movie flick helps you realize the struggle of moving on, by showing us Mike's addiction to past lover. His friends try and help him, but he is too stubborn to let her go. He makes mistakes along the way. Advice from his friends is money and so is this movie. Sure it has filler moments but I think rewatching them I will truly come to love them.

130,weekendwarrior78,One of Top 10 greatest,10,28 January 2006,This is one of the greatest movies that I have ever seen. Its the most accurate movie depicting what the nightlife is like for guys looking for love. John Favreau's character is great as an out of work actor with no confidence or self esteem. Vince Vaughn is also great as one of Favreau's best friends Mike. It depicts what life is like when you have no money or no job. Livingston is also great as Favreau's closest friend. Because we all have that one person that we can tell our insecurities and feelings to and Livingston is great at guiding Favreau's character into safer waters. Helping him understand women and why they do the things they do. This movie is great because men and women can enjoy it.,Swingers
131,magic12,my second favorite,10,22 July 1999,"i loved it the sega hockey seen was perfect and trent's crack of ""there's no clocks in this town"" was genius.  and the music was perfect for every scene.  also mike calling trent double down in the second hockey scene was great. have to watch it over and over. enjoy the small things.",Swingers

In this movie, you see how he comes through it both in terms of his ""swinging"" friends AND in spite of them. The tone of the dialogue is very similar to the movie ""Clerks"" but with a much better tempo. There is also some great music cameos by Big Bad Voodoo Daddy. This is a good movie for the guy's night of poker or drinking. However, I doubt many of the gals will be too keen as the fellas on this one (mine couldn't get into it and she likes Swing Music). Otherwise, have a ""gin and tonic"" with this one with the boys and enjoy.",Swingers
133,josh-162,The greatest breakup movie ever (at least for guys),9,8 January 2001,"We get so tied up in the idea that good movies have to be Meaningful with a capital ""M"" that movies like Swingers get overlooked at the Oscars. Which is a shame, because Jon Favreau (as screenwriter) has an incredible eye for detail, and this movie is full of brilliant (though simple) insights into human nature. If you've ever broken up after a long relationship, if you've ever said ""no girl/boy here is as attractive as my ex"", if you've ever been whupped at Sega hockey, you need to see this movie. Under its cynical, hip exterior, Swingers is a movie about friendship and the sweetness of everyday life. There are no gut-wrenching death scenes, no heavy-handed messages, and you won't leave it feeling like you've learned something you didn't already know. But you will leave it wanting to call old friends and go out, and you'll leave it feeling refreshed and optimistic; which is ultimately both a more difficult and a more worthy accomplishment for a movie.",Swingers

Favreau gives a tremendous performance that captures the not-quite-at-ease feeling of being a New Yorker in Southern California.  Vaughn nails the T character, which is really a caricature of a ""cool"" guy.  It works because he has enough confidence to not be an *obvious* caricature.Liman captures the feel of So Cal well and the soundtrack is great.One of my favorite films.",Swingers

It depicts a life of several good friends in their 20's, which mainly consists of playing video games, ordering pizza, drinking, and picking up chicks.  There is both a lot of sarcasm and silliness.

There is no plot to speak of, a bunch of painfully two-dimensional drunkards float from party to party and call each other ""money"".  The writer, after apparently waking up in his own vomit and blearily looking at his typewriter and realizing this attempted to force a plot by having one of the character wave a gun at some straight-edgers.  While in reality this would have resulted in said character being riddled with bullets (as myself and everyone in the room was eagerly hoping for), the straight-edgers just leave.  End of conflict, end of plot.  This movie took away precious minutes of my life that I can never have back.  Save yourselves, avoid this like the plague!",Swingers

The catchphrases are ""money, baby"" and the use of hip-hop quips are very Ali-G (only the UK audience will get this).

The story is just a few months in the lives of some washed up actors and what they get up to, but it's easy to relate to and you soon become absorbed in the characters.  The comedy is not in your face - its real, and cleverly done.

If, like me, cool clothes, hip phrases and classic one-liners impress then this is the movie for you.  Any single man caught in the never ending tour of clubs and parties in an effort to impress and meet women will easily identify with the characters desperate need to be accepted by their peers.  Some of the dialogue is so sharp it slices like a razor (similar to the clothes and style) and the answer machine scene will have you cringing with embarrassment.  Is it style over substance?

I am pleased to report that this is a very satisfying film that makes the Hollywood club scene (at least in the mid-90's) look hysterical.I love Jon Favreau's script! I cringe each time he boofs an encounter with a girl, whether in a bar or on the phone. And the answering machine as counselor, well, that's terrific.I truly enjoyed watching all these young enthusiastic actors working together.  But the reason to watch is unequivocally Vince Vaughn.  Mr. Vaughn has delivered one of the finest comic performances in modern filmdom. The cool jivin', the dressing, just oozing the style, and incorporating it into his lifestyle, yet with such a subtle emptiness, to me was absolutely side-splitting. Notable are his interactions with waitresses. But say what you will of Trent Walker's (Vaughn) intentions, he's got FANTASTIC hair!!!Swingers: 9 out of 10",Swingers

Since this may also be misleading, simply be aware that this movie depicts the young male psyche in a very real way. If you're a woman, watch this movie and it will help you understand men better: you will know what we do at night and what we're looking for. Yes, we're childish, but also sensitive, at times.

150,Harrpoe,This place is dead anyway!,10,11 April 2003,"Money! Having lived the life of Mike, this movie hits home. No gig, no girl...no self esteem... Hangin with the boys. Who hasn't been there? A virtual plethora of one liners and quotes for guys (this is definitely a guy flick) in their 20's and 30's. Who hasn't left a relationship only to wallow in guilt and self doubt. Especially when you find out the ex is seeing someone else. Add to this the inability to land a decent paying gig, living alone in an unfamiliar town, and having bunch of condescending clowns as your support group and its no wonder that poor Mike was about to return to Queens with his tail between his legs.The best part of this film is the self transformation of Mike from the pitiful whiner holed up in his apartment for days after Sue tells him what a loser he is, to the Bear spotting the Bunny (literally) from the other side of the bar. Though Mike is constantly hearing and taking advise from his posse...ultimately, it is himself who shows that through his own experiences (ball room dance lessons with the ex) and his own strengths of honesty, charm and charisma that he proves he is indeed, money, and lands him the beautiful baby Lorraine. ""It is so on"" as the hilarious Trent (scene stealer Vince Vaughn) first spots the pensive conversation between Mike and Lorraine. (Heather Graham) The looks on Trent's and Sue's faces are priceless as they spy Mike and his beautiful baby working the dance floor to Big Bad Voodoo Daddy's ""Go Daddy O"". I don't think I have ever seen Ms Graham look better that she does here...""It didn't occur to me"" Mike replies to Trent in the final scene when asked why he didn't call the ex back. Amazing what a little confidence (and a dance with a hot blonde) can do for guy!This is a hilarious movie about real guys (you have known somebody like every character in this film!) set against the surreal back drop of the then-hip LA swing scene in the mid 90's doing what they do best....10 out of 10",Swingers

Heather Graham's performance is lacking but that isn't a fault of her own. Her character is limited and she hasn't really impressed me to date, yet. This is Vaughn's best performance maybe challenged by Clay Pigeons or even Old School. Forget all that Frat Pack trash (Will Ferrell, Ben Stiller, and the Wilson brothers) this is a funny movie.

153,adzrussell,I wanted to call all of my friends after I first saw this film!,8,21 May 2005,"I chanced upon Swigers one evening after reading an article on writer/star Jon Favreau, and trying to figure out which character he played in Friends (it's Pete Becker by the way); don't you love it when you uncover a gem. From the opening credits, set to Dean Martin crooning ""You're Nobody Until Somebody Loves You"", I knew that this film was the very personification of cool, spawning one of the coolest characters in any film...ever, that being Trent Walker played by Vince Vaughn, with a swinging soundtrack and a real sense of fun which you don't often get in mainstream Hollywood; and this film is effortless in a way which Tarantino could only dream about.The story centres around Favreau's loser-in-love Mikey, trying to make a living as an actor in L.A after leaving his long-term girlfriend behind in New York. His best buddy, Trent, tries incessantly to get Mikey back 'into the game' so to speak; cue a trawl around L.A's hippest night-spots, some hilarious insight into dating rituals (when is it cool to call? 2 days?), and a trip to Las Vegas in which Trent tries to 'pull a Fredo' (bedding cocktail waitresses two at a time). The central duo are ably supported by a cast of lovable rogues, all intent on getting laid.Doug Liman directs in a laid-back manner, befitting of the film, and Favreau's script (based on Vaughn and himself) is full of witty insights and in-jokes, as well as enough movie references to keep everyone happy.Although the characters are almost impossibly cool, they never appear obnoxious due to the over-riding sense that they are just a bunch of lovable losers trying to con their way into the beds of L.A's female population; sometimes succeeding, sometimes not, and there is a certain sweetness added by Favreau's predicament. The pay-off is cool, Favreau finally 'getting digits' and we are left with a role-reversal between the two main protagonists as Trent makes a fool of himself with a woman in the closing scene.Altogether a classy, breezy, often hilarious film, a certain cult classic, and a fine addition to the date movie genre.",Swingers

There is the alpha male ""Trent"", the alpha in training ""Sue"", the submissive thinker ""Mike"", and the followers ""Rob, et al"".

Favrea and Vaughn can be sad, depressing, inadequate and I do not feel it empowers males who watch it.I feel the spiritual sequel - Made (2001) - with both Favreau and Vaughn portray males that are much stronger, successful and principled (e.g. by being a saviour at the end of the movie).Not to mention Made is simply funnier if you're looking for classic Vince Vaughn one liners combined with an outstanding performance by Puff Daddy and Peter Falk.

The script is great, and very hip. The movie is packed with funny and cool dialogues. l laughed through the whole film, sometimes just because I loved the conversations so much. The main characters are very well written. The acting is good.Specially  Vince Voyer, he was fantastic. His character, Trent. A smooth talking player, who knows all the tricks of the hustling trade, was the peek of the movie. I enjoyed that guy so much, I could sit and listen to him talk for hours. The film is written by Jon Favreu, who also played the main character, Mike. He was very believable as a guy trying to get over his long-time girlfriend.

The characters feel shallow and you don't get to know them throughout the movie. From the shallow characters the movie does not develop in any way. At the end I was happy the movie ended.

We all have those friends who try to help us to our feet. Trent is the guy who really looks out for you but comes off strong. Rob is the really good listener who you trust the most. I think this film is an excellent look into our way of dealing with romantic problems. It is, so to speak, a guy's chick flick. I think people should view this film for its comedy of course, but also, for the reality of the film. Jon Favreu did an excellent job of capturing reality.

170,liptong,It's my favorite,10,13 May 2004,"I loved Swingers.  It's probably my favorite movie; not necessarily ""the best"" movie I've ever seen, but definitely my favorite.  I think every guy has been in Mike's (Jon Favreau) shoes at some point in his life, and the acting in this movie is better than most other movies I've seen.  Jon Favreau plays Mike better than anyone probably could, Vince Vaughn is superb as the sarcastic yet loyal and supportive best friend Trent, and Ron Livingston's performance as Rob, Mike's best friend from New York, probably could have (and should have) gotten him an Oscar nomination had this movie been more mainstream. It's not a blockbuster, it's not shot with special effects or glitz and glamour and Johnny Depp, but it's still the best movie I've seen.  A feel good movie that that I learn more about every time I watch it. 9.5/10.",Swingers

Favreau and Vaughn are a great comic team and this film delivers more laughs than just about any film I have seen in the last ten years. You especially appreciate it if you have ever lived in Southern California. The scene where they all take off to a party in their individual cars got especially big laughs from me and my wife as we recall how car crazy it can get in that part of the country. I think Vaughn is one of the great comic actors of this era and this is definitely one of his best films to date.

The film starts slowly, but soon it morphs into a film that both makes you smile & empathize with the characters lives & you find yourself wanting to see how these progress. It has a similar feel to the great film Diner, it's really a film for the boys , but isn't afraid to show its feminine side. Nice touches include the nods to Goodfellas & Reservoir Dogs. The film just gets better as it progresses . As the owner of A Sega Mega Drive, I also enjoyed the NHL Hockey scenes.

Jon Favreau couldn't have been more on the money with this script, I couldn't believe that such a story could come from one insignificant man.  Vince Vaughn is the definition of charisma and because of this movie I have decided to see Psycho (the remake).  Jon Favreau also acted beautifully.  I am trying to describe this movie, but there are no words to describe its excellence and greatness.  Everyone has to see it.  After it you kind of feel like you instantly want to go out on the town and learn how to swing, pick up babies, and be as money as you can.  This movie gives you self-confidence while telling you that you have to be yourself in order to find the right person. I am forever changed because of this movie.

179,Vike00,"This movie IS the ""guy experience""",8,30 April 2000,"It is a rare occurrence when you truly identify with a movie.  But while watching Swingers, I did scene after scene.  I have felt as pathetic as Mikey after he leaves the messages on Nikki's answering machine, but I also know how great it feels when you hook up with a girl like Loraine.  I have a friend who IS Trent.  My friends and I have probably had the same arguments over the steadicam shot in GoodFellas vs. the slow motion opening credit sequence from Reservoir Dogs. From my experience, the scene with the guys playing video games is one of the truest ever put on film.
Where this movie excels in in its subtleties.  I love the nicknames they give each other and how they get 8s on the 3 par golf course.  No matter how many times I've seen it, it is impossible for me not to laugh at the ""bunny/fangs"" sequence.To those who complain about the lack of a traditional plot, I say ""so what?"" The informality and lack of focus pretty much mirrors these guys' lives. And it makes for one of the most exhilaratingly entertaining movies in recent memory.I could go on forever raving about this movie, but I just have to say that if you haven't seen this film, go rent it tonight.""We all have stories""  and Doug Liman and Jon Farveau have teamed up to tell us a few great ones.",Swingers

In all seriousness though, this movie is one that anyone can relate to.  It's made for my generation, and it is something that we all see within our lives.  Mikey's struggle with life after having his heart broken and Trent's love for the ladies; it's a story about life.  It's a story about everyone you will ever know and everyone you will ever meet.  We are all someone in that movie, and most of us -- the lucky ones -- can relate ourselves to Mikey.  But, we all want to be viewed as Trent -- the funloving, outgoing, party guy.  We love this movie for all that it stands for, and all it can help us achieve.  And Rollergirl Heather Graham (Lorraine) doesn't hurt either.",Swingers

There are layers of interpretation and observation throughout, which make the film come to life. It is like real life on the screen, it's like going out with friends and savouring their defeats and their triumphs. Swingers inspires a feeling of vitality and continuity in life beyond any other film I've ever seen. It doesn't deal in global issues, the rich, the powerful, the important, or the unfortunate. It doesn't deal in drugs, or crime, or violence. Other films do that well enough, but not one other film captures the essence of feeling good in your life the way Swingers does.Watch it, it's the money.",Swingers
182,Tarheel-4,Terrific Dialogue + Parallel Construction = Great Flick,10,4 August 1999,"Having heard my buddies talk about ""Swingers"" incessantly, and bandy about words such as ""money"", ""bitch"" and ""Vegas, Baby, Vegas"" for months, I finally bit the bullet and saw Swingers in early '98.Since then, ""Swingers"" has become my all-time favorite movie, surpassing such notables as ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Braveheart"" in my book.One reason I love this movie so much is that I completely identify with Mikey.  It is impossible to watch this movie without actually *hurting* for Mikey as you watch his various travails in the dating world.  Particularly heart-wrenching is the famous answering machine scene.  That scene, while hysterical, makes you want to jump up and just slap the phone out of his hand.  The worst part, is that nearly every guy has likely had a vaguely similar experience about calling girls and answering machines.A second reason I love this movie is the witty dialogue.  While several critics seem to denounce the movie as a poor attempt to achieve Tarantino-like dialogue, I believe the film equals and perhaps surpasses ""Pulp Fiction""'s conversational quality.  The best movie dialogue always sounds like a natural conversation, rather than a scripted and stilted translation of the writer's vision.  Watching Mikey, Trent, Sue and Ron interact takes me back to my college days and how my friends and I used to talk...Added to the somewhat grainy quality of the film, the dialogue makes it readily believable that the viewer is merely a fly on the wall looking into the lives of real guys.The third reason why this movie is outstanding is the parallel plot construction.  Occasionally denounced as devoid of meaningful plot, ""Swingers"" proves anything but.  The central issue of Mikey getting over his girlfriend is a constant theme, and the movie never strays too far. Particularly masterful is the tying together of the first and last scenes, in which Liman brings the entire movie together and provides a satisfying bit of closure to the every-man viewer such as myself, proving that sometimes nice guys can finish first.This is the ONLY movie I have ever purchased.  I believe that it is one of the best indy-movies ever made.  I think that all guys should be required to view this flick.  And for the critics who can't get over their own self-importance and self-styled images as movie buffs, get a grip--this is a movie about men, being men....shut up and enjoy it...you know you want to.",Swingers
183,Damo-13,This is the money and it doesn't even know it!,10,26 August 1999,"The first time I saw Swingers, I felt that I had found the ultimate film about young guys dealing with the sort of problems all young guys have to deal with.  Finding work, pining over some girl who you broke up with 6 months ago, pretending you are the money, even though you don't even know it (or whatever), waiting the right amount of days before you call a girl, drinking too much etc...  This film has such an amazing unassuming style.  It brings back memories of the brat-pack (from the fifties, not the eighties), swing clubs and Sinatra.I read an interview with Doug Liman the other day, which said that the film was only made to show to Hollywood producers!  It was not even supposed to make cinemas, let alone become the cult hit it has become.  I LOVE this film!  Excellent performances from actors, especially Vince Vaughn.  Reall",Swingers

(ie...not calling a girl for 2 days, attempting to build up a friends confidence to talk to a beautiful baby, etc...) even though my parents can not relate to this movie as well as i did, they still found it humorous enough to laugh out loud at the type of lifestyle the lovable characters (ie...my friends and i) lead.  it is as if all of us have a little mikey in us sometimes, especially when our confidence is down!  but eventually with the help of our friends, we all come out of our shell and return back to form.  i am sure that many of us even have friends as ""money"" as trent that can do no wrong with the ladies. i cannot possibly explain how much i enjoy this movie other than to say that my apartment and i watch this movie at least once a week, especially on nights when we ourselves go out and party with the ladies.  we constantly quote the movie as if we just watched it for the first time the night before and still laugh like we did the first time we all saw it three years ago. this movie is one of my ""classics"".  a timeless movie that ranks up there with the breakfast club (or any other john hughes film), beautiful girls, go, and american pie.  the type of movie that becomes an underground classic simply because it tells it like it is.  10+ out of 10.",Swingers

I've never seen Jon Favreau the same after this movie.  The Replacements, nope; Very Bad Things, no way.  Just not happening.  And I have to admit, I saw Vince Vaughn's performace in The Lost World before seeing Swingers, but I don't hold that against him at all.

There is a lot of objectionable language, but it is refreshing not to see any gratuitous nudity.

I first saw this film about 2 months after its video release and it now has a home in my DVD collection, making its way into the player every couple of months.  The film starts as typically as any film of my ""Generation X"", in a coffee shop with two guys talking, takes a road trip to Vegas, and swings back through the LA club scene. It is a comedy that knows how to go for the subtle laugh (Talking about the movie ""Casino"" ...""You'd have to be nuts to film in a casino."" The  movie sets itself in a casino in Vegas for part of the first act).The real charm of the movie is its dead on writing.  The guys actually do GUY things, they play golf (not very well), they hang out playing video hockey, they go out drinking and looking for women.  It may all seem a little cliche, but its what single guys do.If you've only seen Vince Vaughn in ""Clay Pigeons"" or god forbid the Van Sant ""Psycho"" remake, then you truly haven't seen the actor at his best. His comic timing and delivery shine through in this film. (If you'd like to see him at his dramatic best, then ""Return to Paradise"" is a great choice)From the hip LA lingo to the great locations and soundtrack, ""Swingers"" is a just a fun film.  On a recent trip to LA, I actually went scouting out a few of the film's locales -  The Hollywood Hills Diner on Franklin, the Dresden Restaurant on N. Vermont where I got to see Marty and Elayne play a set.One warning, you may start referring to your friends as ""Baby"" or calling them ""Money"" after seeing this film.  (9 out of 10)",Swingers

It provides a certain truth about what it is that guys do when being guys and what it is that guys think about for that matter when not drooling over a half-naked female in a halter top and leather pants ensemble at some trendy hotspot on Melrose.You want to know how to act in front of women? Need some pointers? Do you ladies want to know why men are the way they are then forget about all of those blase sitcoms and redundant ""man's magazines"" and see this movie for any and all necessary information and ask no more questions. All hestitation about the opposite sex will be clarified by the end of this film and one will be guaranteed to be smoother, more suave and simply appear to be just that much more cooler than before you saw the film in the first place (guys at least).As far as acting is concerned, all of the characters in the movie are late 20 something guys looking to become future actors in Hollywood (ironic, eh?), and they are outstanding. Trent, Vince Vaughn, is the smooth talker, never one to fail with the tail and the one-liners. Watching and observing closely behind him is Mikey, Jon Favreau, who helped to write and produce this movie and one who continues to wreak himself over a past loved one during the course of the swingers' journey. Also worthy of mention in this high-powered entourage of groupies you'll find a sincere Ron Livingston, a slick, hard-nosed Pat Van Horn and a genuine Heather Graham as well as a host of talented and believable others.

At the very least this stands as the greatest ""guy"" movie I've ever seen. Hollywood loves to churn out those ""hey, we're regular guys just like you!"" movies, but they rarely work. The jokes are contrived, the chemistry is forced, the characters remind me of no one that I know in my life, and the dialogue is written by middle-aged men. People in their 20's are supposed to relate to that?? This movie worked because these guys really WERE friends and, essentially, filmed their lives. Would Jerry Bruckheimer have thought to include the immortal ""NHL 95"" scene? Of course not. Could any writer that was not in their 20's give us so many quotable lines? I was 20 when this film was released and it instantly went into my HOF. Not to sound corny, but there are very few films that I feel connected to. ""Swingers"" is one. Aside from the laughs, this film is extremely intelligent at times. Rob's advice to Mikey remains one of the most poignant monologues I have seen in any film. Luckily for us, Favreau was smart enough to deliver a movie that can cut to the core of a problem that every guy will experience at some point in his life without trying to get too preachy or sentimental.

His portrayal of a sensitive guy is very contrived and dull.The characters in this movie are very one dimensional ,no one ever says something meaningful or remotely funny, for a guy movie its slightly above average because you can see that a lot of creativity was involved but just didn't deliver and in the end couldn't pass for anything else unfortunately.The film itself isn't filmed well either.The camera angles are boring like someone filmed them without any prior knowledge of filming and had Martin Scorsese in mind .Vince Vaughn and Ron Living are okay but they always play the same parts.The reservoir dogs references are weak and deciduous.I understand that this movie is about guys going out and getting laid and showing up whats its like to be in your late 20s in Los Angeles ,New York during the 90s.But it does such a bad job that You thought you would have more fun in some torn third world country (no disrespect as i come from such a country myself)If you happen to like mediocre nostalgic guy movies.Go and watch it.But I've seen way better movies made with even less finance and more heart.Id be happy to recommend them.",Swingers

My favorite character in it (though I love them all) is Rob. His insecurity is cute, but of course he's also a loyal friend. You can't beat that. And I love the goofy quote. ""Hi, Mom. I'm goofy.

The group goes from party to club to apartment (where they call each other 'bitch' while playing video games). As a bonus for the moviegoer sitting through this wretch of a production, Mike, the main character, has this annoying emotional baggage he carries around, and it goes on and on and on ad nauseum.

The movie is about a young Jon Favreau who plays a struggling stand-up, who has just split up with his girlfriend and his friends encourage him to get back out there and chat up new young ladies. The plot is loosely based on Jon Favreau's life and Favreau uses his own apartment in the filming of this low budget indie movie. Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn had previously met on the set of Rudy and after they cemented a good friendship together Vince got the part co-staring next to Favreau. This in my opinion is still Vince Vaughn's finest performance as he shows off all his traits: confident, cheeky and swagger in his way with the ladies.

A very clever movie that really captures true friendships and personal confusions. The main character , Mike (Jon Fraveau) and Trent (Vince Vaungh) are dead on one of the best movie duos ever. Mike comes to LA to become a star, a New Yorker who still pines for his ex girlfriend and constantly burdens his circle of friends with his concerns while they try and couch him back into the dating scene. An awesome ending.A MUST SEE!!",Swingers
207,robert_frew,Swingers definitely going to be a classic!,9,5 January 2006,"The only thing I have to say is that this movie is going to be a classic on my list. You knew Vince Vaughn was heading in the right direction starring in this movie, look at him in Wedding Crashers!!!This is definitely a movie I can watch again and again. It reminds me of me and my friends and the good old days. You know how some movies you can relate to or some movies hold special memories? This is one of them. I know this may sound absurd but bring on a sequel, lol. I've never laughed harderRobwww.swingular.com",Swingers
208,vk-777-278558,One of my favorite lift-my-mood-up film.,9,29 August 2013,"In the most bare minimum of screen-time, this movie does what it's supposed to do, and there's whole lot of fun on the way. Career, relationships, friends, whatever might be the issue you are dealing with, this one might just kick off a brainwave with the solution's idea.The first film that I gift or advise anyone to watch if someone's come out of a messy break-up, especially guys. It just hits you where it should, and never gets preachy. One more thing, for budding screenwriters and film-makers, you guys should devour this film inside out, great things can be learned just by watching this film back to back. The usage of dialogs, the chemistry between the actors, bare minimum camera movements. And a story as nicely told as they should be, in the minimum number of minutes.",Swingers
209,ponasponas,A movie that will change... the way you talk,10,20 April 2005,"This kind of movie paradox comes once in a few years - it has flaws in directing, writing and acting, yet it stuns you and leaves you wanting to get into movies no matter what. Or at least get packed and go the Vegas. Vegas, baby, Vegas! It an absolute must-see, absolute cult buddy-movie, and no matter that 10 years have passed, it's dialog will get under your tongue. Show it to your friends and watch them start swinger-slanging' the next day. Hell, it even makes 90s look great.With all it's shortcomings, Swingers still has what moves 'perfect' movies lack - the magic of cinema of being the life itself.",Swingers
210,kduffey-58500,"It's supposed to be a comedy, right?",3,3 March 2020,"Let me start this off by saying, that I didn't get around to seeing this movie until 2017, well after the height of Vince Vaughn's career as a comedic leading man (or in this case, supporting role), so perhaps the appeal for his delivery and comedic style was already worn on me. While I thought seeing a young Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn was cool, the story never captured me. And while a lot of comedies can get away with having a bad or even non-existent stories, those instances rely on the jokes and situational comedy to be their saving grace. Swingers, isn't funny. It just isn't. The movie didn't even make me crack a smile. Between Favreau's character moping and not wanting to be in any of the situations, and Vaughn's character just constantly saying things are ""Money Baby!"" (A line that makes my skin crawl it used so much) There are zero jokes! There isn't one scene of true comedy in the entire film. And maybe this movie is supposed to be more drama than comedy (hence the Comedy/Drama descriptor), but I truly feel this movies can not even be classified as a comedy. To me this movie has the outline of what could have been a good comedy film, but the actual funny people who wrote and starred in it, didn't fill that outline with any actual funny moments. I know all film is suggestive, but I honestly don't know how anyone can give this movie anything more than 3 stars.",Swingers
211,callmeabhi-77368,Very Entertaining and 20-something movie !,10,23 June 2016,"You're looking for a job, spend time with your cool friends playing video games, hooking up with women just after a long relationship breakup. I mean theses are kinds of things a 20-something guy typically does and this movie explains this perfectly. I loved the characters in this film especially Treant(VV) on how he smoothly scores women while his friend Mike struggles after a breakup. Some scenes are hilarious and some are cool to watch. The Dialogues are creative and dude-like :) I recommend this movie to any 20-something guy to watch for fun, entertainment and some insights in the world of dating 8/10 from me :D",Swingers
212,elliot-48,What a cracking film...,8,22 August 2005,"Vince Vaughn again at his very best, this film is funny from start to finish. It propelled Vince to stardom, as we have seen with his more recent efforts, there all crackers. I just loved his reference to HTTP://www.swinger-personals.co.UK it was hilarious! Keep up the good work Vince!I think it was the attitude shown by the director and the producers which allowed the film to flow in to the comical masterpiece it is. I think it is a film that could almost be said to be genre defining in the comedy area, it was top notch from start to finish and well worth a watch!",Swingers
213,jsgueglia,Great music... and that's it,3,30 November 2017,"I'll be honest, I only watched this movie because I purchased it as part of an iTunes bundle package. There were too many lines in this movie that were demeaning to women. It seems like the writers wanted the main character to be a ""down to earth lovable nice guy"" when really he was an asshole. The cherry on top of the numerous ""skank"" comments was about college girls; ""The girls are young, they drink - They don't know any better."" wow. The main character also claims that he wants his ex ""to be happy"" when he really means he wants her to get back with him. ""Why won't she call?"" Then when she does call and confesses that she loves him, he tells her he'll call her back and never does. Oh, but he just wants her to be happy. A lot of other characters were tools. Also, the costumes were just awful. Maybe on purpose?Despite all this, the music in the movie is really good. They're songs written and performed by others unrelated to the production of this movie, but still, a nice collection. For that, I gave Swingers three stars.",Swingers
214,steve_christy,"Swingers, a man's man movie.",10,20 November 2005,"Swingers is such a great guy's movie. Maybe you just graduated from college or are looking for a great job or trying to get over an ex, this movie says it all so open, honest, and funny. I think this movie started new trends and the soundtrack should be in everyones collection. I would love to see Mr Favreau do a sequel or another movie like this. I love when in the end, they are going to have a substantial and deep conversation and are distracted by the woman. They never get to the conversation, which is so true when it comes to guys. I know this movie is almost 10 years old, but it is one of my favorites, you must own the movie and the soundtrack. Jon, I would love an extra role in your next movie!",Swingers

216,lickikiti,Real Swingers,1,10 January 2006,"This movie is a joke i hated it and the title ""swingers"" is misued, swingers are primarily couples that swap partners for intercourse, for more on this is what the encyclopedia has to say - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swinging. So two lonely guys trying to get laid in a caravan is really not representing the title of this movie at all. The acting is also at best mediocre and the ""one liners"" are tacky. I do not recommend this movie to anyone, it demeans swingers, single guys and single women. Looking at the comments I cannot perceive how anyone enjoyed this or found it funny, everyone to their own I guess, but don't tell me i haven't warned you",Swingers
217,marketing-85,Swingers Top 10 Reasons Why this Movis is Good,7,29 March 2006,"Swingers could be a hip movie, a Guys movie, great-sagacious-advice movie, a warm-amusing movie, this-is-what-friendship-is-about movie, or simply one of the most facetious for-a-lark flicks of the 90s. But whatever tag you wish to stick on it, this honest, low-budget humdinger from Liman is very very ""money""! Top 10 reasons to get your hands on this movie now: (1) It's fast-paced, well edited (not one wasted scene) and frequently laugh-out-loud funny. If you hear people dismiss this as an inconsequential narrative about a ""bunch of losers trying to get laid"", I'm afraid they just have not watched the entire movie. I am not into the ""Spy who shagged me"" genre of humor, but this movie will truly grow on you.(2) It'll ring a bell with almost anyone, particularly guys. Mike -- a crestfallen loverboy (Jon Favreau) is in the throes of a breakup, and his confidence has hit rock bottom. (Sidenote: Favreau is a very ordinary looking guy, which in fact imho is the power of his character.) Under the aegis of his friend Trent (Vince Vaughn, in top form, a lot better than his controlled acting in, gulp, The Psycho) Mike re-learns how to get back up on his feet and take reins of his life/emotions again. While this happens, we are treated to a bunch of every-day faux pas that we all can identify with in a blink. Interested yet? (3) The boys' camaraderie is infectious. If you watch this movie with friends -- and this indeed is the best way to watch it! -- you'll know what I mean. This has to be one of the most honest portrayals of relationships between friends -- both the lover and the platonic variety.(4) Call me weird but I loved the sound track, a delectable blend of underground jazz and triphop.(5) Some of the ""get back on your feet"" dialogue for Mike is truly marvellous, and makes for better, more down-to-earth, more inspiring advice about life and relationships than Dr. Ruth and Oprah put together.(6) An interesting look at the Los Angeles we never see in films, the underground life of the struggling actors and writers and less glamorous people, not living in Malibu opulence as seen in other weaker films.(7) Some great Sega Genesis NHL ice-hockey ""footage"" (to use a dignified term) and an unusual preview of seeing Gretzky's head knocked.(8) This is to men what ""Sex and the City"" is to women. (Ok, SATC has had a lot more time than Swingers to entice us with the workings of the Modern Woman, but you get the idea) (9) A wide assortment of one-liners for you to conveniently plagiarize from. Not seen in a single movie since Roxanne with Steve Martin.(10) Oh, and it's so laid back, its horizontal. No spiffy visual FX, no crash boom bang, no cheap frills. But still a high handsome homerun.",Swingers
