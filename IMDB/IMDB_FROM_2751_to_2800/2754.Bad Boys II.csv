0,Leofwine_draca,"Loud, graphic, action overload",6,16 October 2015,"Although director Michael Bay is dangerously close to becoming a caricature of himself, his showy, flashy direction somehow helps BAD BOYS II to be a good, if overlong, film. It's pretty much a clichéd action movie, with an age-old plot, yet revamped with outrageous flashy camera-work, non-stop cutting and editing, and a style of filming which is completely OTT in every respect. The bare-bones story sees cops Smith and Lawrence returning to battle a Cuban drug lord, and getting involved in plenty of shoot-outs and battles throughout. Smith and Lawrence fast-talk their way through a vulgar script peppered with hit-and-miss gags and acquaint themselves well with the action scenario. Said action is often spectacular, ranging from super-fire shoot-outs to an amazing car chase involving a car transporter – excellent special effects make this one to watch.Some may be put off by the ghoulish streak of black comedy running throughout the movie, which peaks as the boys chase a morgue wagon across town, with bodies flying out of the back and disintegrating. For a 15 certificate, this movie has more than its fair share of blood, guts and mayhem, so most action lovers will find themselves at home here. On the downside, it is headache-inducing, what with all the incessant music, and it does outstay its welcome long before the end credits roll. But generally this is solid B-movie fare which just happens to have an AAA budget.",Bad Boys II
1,SnoopyStyle,Big Bombastic Bloated,5,25 September 2013,"The boys are back. Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) are kicking butt. At least Marcus is getting shot in the butt. Mike has been seeing Marcus' sister Sydney Burnett (Gabrielle Union) who's works in the DEA office. Marcus has asked for a transfer away from Mike. But neither is willing to fess up. They're assigned to investigate the flow of drugs, and run smack into Syd who's gone undercover.Director Michael Bay is unapologetic in creating a big bombastic popcorn movie. It opens with the heroes taking down the KKK. And if you think he can't get any louder, he throws you into a car chase to end all chases. I must admit it is crazy fun. The one thing Michael Bay knows how to do is blow things up. But it does get tiring. It's loud, annoying, and doesn't let up. It's a brutal way to spend 2 and 1/2 hours. But I do recommend the car chase to everybody. It's definitely worth repeat viewings.",Bad Boys II
2,claudio_carvalho,Shut Down your Brain and See a Funny Movie,7,14 February 2005,"In Florida, Detective Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and Detective Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) are investigating the traffic and dealing of ecstasy. The clues lead the cops to a funeral home owned by the Cuban drug baron Hector Juan Carlos 'Johnny' Tapia (Jordi Mollà), but Mike and Marcus have difficulties to find evidences to send the powerful gangster to the jail. Meanwhile, Mike dates Detective Syd (Gabrielle Union), the younger sister of Marcus, who is working under covered in the same case without their knowledge. ""Bad Boys II"" is a very irregular film, having funny and great moments, but also parts very ridiculous. The parts with the corpses are very comical scenes, the destruction of cars is also great and the discussions between the two partners are usually hilarious. Marcus under the effect of ecstasy in the home of Captain Howard (Joe Pantoliano) is also great. When the story shifts to Cuba, it becomes an ideological crap, labeling Cuba as a country of drug dealers and whores, where American soldiers do not respect the sovereignty of that nation and invade as if it was their back yard. Fortunately this part is very short, and if the viewer shuts down the brain, he or she will have a good time with the rest of the movie. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Bad Boys II""",Bad Boys II
3,kosmasp,Action packed messy sequel,8,5 May 2021,"Away with the marital issues from the first one and into the action for this one. Away also with Tea Leoni - which really is a shame, I really dug her character and her sass. But while we do get a new love interest for Mike Lowry (his partners sister nonetheless, though she goes MIA for the third one - let's see if we get her back for the fourth one), this is really focused on the action! While the first movie was suave and smooth and tried a bit of Miami Vice (not just because it is based in Miami), this really goes all out on the violence - which earned it an 18 rating in Germany as opposed to the 16 ratings for the other two movies.Btw if I am not mistaken, it was Martin Lawrence who was billed and paid more than Will Smith for this. Which really surprised me back then. You either dig his style or you may find it annoying I reckon, Will Smith seemed more solid and grounded overall. Not to mention the better actor (no offense). But it is all about Box office attraction and it seemed that Martin was ahead when it came to that.While I dig what the action does here, there are also quite the really cringe worthy moments here. If you want to be offended, there will be enough elements here that will you give you just that - one of the ""worst examples"" being the scene in a mall with TVs and the camera. Suffice to say that some might have laughed through the whole scene and might find my criticism thereof to be mad. Again I can't tell you how to feel in certain scenes, but I can tell you that you may have issues with it. Sexism and homophobia (even if it tries not to be too in your face with it) are underlying throughout, but most extreme here! There are other examples (the morgue being another one) of course.If you can overcome these things, you can relish and cherish the action and the really great framing of it all ... with some over the top violence that might not be for everyones stomache. And then there is the last part of the movie ... where we leave Miami and go ... to war! Literally! Which feels completely detached from the rest of the movie! Even after rewatching it the other day that feeling was the same ... still ... you get a lot of bang for your buck! Or however the saying goes.",Bad Boys II
4,jboothmillard,Bad Boys II,4,3 December 2007,"The first movie was the directorial debut for Michael Bay (The Rock, Armageddon, Transformers), and made big stars of the leading actors, it took eight years for this sequel, I had seen it once before, and I noticed it wasn't rated well by critics, so I watched again to confirm my opinion. Basically, Miami Police Department (MPD) narcotics division detectives Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) are investigating a flow of ecstasy into the city, leading them to a KKK meeting and drug drop. The subsequent raid is botched and leads to a firefight, klansmen are reprimanded, and Marcus is accidentally shot in the buttocks by Mike. Marcus questions if he wants to remain partners with Mike. Meanwhile, Mike is concealing a relationship with Marcus' sister, Syd (Gabrielle Union). Mike and Marcus are unaware that Syd is working undercover the Drug Enforcement Administration, laundering money for a Russian gangster group, who distribute ecstasy on behalf of Cuban drug lord Hector Juan Carlos 'Johnny' Tapia (Jordi Mollà). While transporting this money between the Russians and Tapia, Syd is suddenly attacked by vicious hayti hitmen planning to steal it. Mike and Marcus inadvertently stumble into the action, resulting in an intense gunfight and car chase, devastating the local area and enraging Police Captain Conrad Howard (Joe Pantoliano). Marcus and Mike discover Syd's involvement, and Howard demands they find the supplier of ecstasy. Marcus and Mike confront the hayti gang and after interrogating the leader find out that a local mortuary is possibly being used by Tapia as a front for more money laundering. The pair then go to Tapia's mansion disguised as pest exterminators, and penetrating it discover that Tapia has gotten rid of some of his Russian distributors and is courting Syd, still undercover. The detectives find the boat used for drug smuggling after forcing captured Klan member Floyd Poteet (Michael Shannon) to reveal its location. Mike and Marcus infiltrate Tapia's mortuary and learn that he is using dead bodies to smuggle drugs and money. During the search, Marcus accidentally ingests some of the ecstasy, they are almost caught, and Mike orders disguised officers outside to create a diversion. The mortuary and Tapia's mansion are raided, but vengeful Russian gangster Alexei (Peter Stormare) interferes. He and the cops are killed, while Tapia discovers Syd, kidnaps her and takes her to Cuba. With Syd held hostage in Tapia's compound and guarded by the Cuban army, he demands the return of his money in exchange for Syd. Mike and Marcus, with a team of volunteer S.W.A.T. members, CIA operatives and DEA agents, assault Tapia's compound. Syd is rescued, and a chase ensues, which ends outside of the U.S. Naval Station Guantanamo Bay. Marcus defeats Tapia by shooting his forehead, causing him to fall backwards on a few of the landmines, obliterating his body. Mike thanks and congratulates Marcus for rescuing him before kissing Syd. Later, at the Burnett house, Marcus finally makes peace with Mike dating Syd. Marcus and Mike re-affirm their partnership as they celebrate their patriotic victory by singing ""Bad Boys"". Also starring Theresa Randle as Theresa Burnett, Jon Seda as Roberto, Yul Vazquez as Detective Mateo Reyes and Jason Manuel Olazábal as Detective Marco Vargas. Smith and Lawrence as the mismatched bickering cops does deliver some amusing moments, there are some bits that really made me laugh (the mortuary scene especially) and there are some exciting sequences involving high-speed chases, guns blazing and explosions, but the fast-paced camerawork can become nauseating, there ""love story"" and calming with the word ""Woosah"" subplots are nonsense, the drug dealing stuff is predictable, and it is much too long, a silly, not all funny and only just watchable action comedy. Okay!",Bad Boys II
5,Quinoa1984,"oh, this isn't a good movie.... and yet I watched it, and didn't turn it off",3,28 September 2009,"I'm sure there may be some smart people out there who legitimately like, or maybe even love, Bad Boys II. But I would hope that those people, those of which I haven't met face-to-face, would enjoy it for all the wrong reasons. This is a guilty pleasure flick of such a high order that unless the person watching the movie is just in it for all of the stupid, horrid, racist (yes, racist) and mind-boggling moments in this film that add up to innumerable counts, you'll need a quick dose of Stephen Hawking to get your IQ level back up to speed. Believe me, there is a reason why Edgar Wright parodied this in Hot Fuzz - he saw what it was going for, perhaps even enjoyed it in terms of its plasticity as a film, and decided to mock it mercilessly. Even as parody, Hot Fuzz is Lawrence of Arabia when compared to Bad Boys II with regards to comedy, action, acting, storytelling, violence, and even intentional over-the-top hilarity. Oh, this is a bad movie indeed...And yet, hence the ellipses, I must admit that when when Michael Bay turns his own visual floodgates loose, it's... still bad. But in this case it's the kind of fascinating bad that you can't turn away from. There's no need to talk about plot - it's Miami Vice meets a 6th-removed-inbred spawn of Lethal Weapon - so let's jump into the meat of the potato, shall we? It's all about flashy action that is meant to EXPLODE the audience AWAY! Two capital letters, people! When we get a car chase, it isn't just a car chase, it has to include LOTS of machine guns and rapid-fire cuts to the people firing guns and people driving/dodging/crashing their cars, so much so it has to give John Landis circa 1980 an aneurysm. When we see Martin Lawrence and Will Smith banter, it can't just be banter - it has to be just a notch above jive-talking, sometimes just plain mean-speak (if too ridiculous like when the two ambush a 15 year old asking for Lawrence's daughter on a date and Smith just happens to have a 40 of beer).Oh, and when we are shown what Cuba is like, it has to be the kind of Cuba that doesn't mind its shanty towns (the kind one saw in such a sympathetic and poetic light in I Am Cuba) ripped to pieces by a Hummer (yes, one of those BIG-F***-YOU cars) and a, uh, other truck following behind. Oh, and if there's some schmaltz, like say Will Smith's cop looking at a goofy yearbook picture of himself when he was a NERD (and yes, it's shameful to be such a nerd in Bay's house of movie), or when the big twist occurs with Lawrence's cop's sister taken hostage, it can only last said two seconds before going on to the next idiotic joke, or the next retarded shot or cut-away, or, of course, such an action scene that will bleed your senses dry. If you happen to also be watching at home, get ready to scream at your television and have something to throw at the screen. It's one of those, oh yes.But did it ever get so bad that I came close to turning off the TV? Well, almost, like when Lawrence does a 'this is what happens when you get on E"" scene, which is so painful to endure it made me pine for the leg-shaving scene in Cabin Fever. For all that Smith might try, he and Lawrence don't click in a way that is funny - unless if the kind of humor you enjoy is the rude and (ugly) sarcastic tone that Bay often carries being a 40-something frat boy - and many, many scenes meant to bring out guffaws left me dead cold. Which means, of course, there's a lot of dull time where Bay tells a superficial drug deal plot where one can feel his patience where thin during the running time. I can imagine his script notes in a scene of simple dialog: ""Ok, this is all good, but... where's the explosion! I need something HUGE to knock this f***er to the ground! How about a random fire or a landmine? Can we put an armed nuclear robot in the scene somewhere - ah, here it goes!"" So as you can imagine, Bad Boys II is junk of a high order. Sometimes, like during that big car chase on the bridge I did my best to get into it, I laughed at the wretched talent on display, of Bay's slick knack for composing shots and then disgust at the shambles of the result in the editing room. It's what Bay and, not to forget, Bruckheimer do best, I suppose. Not a fan, you could say, but in this case, curiosity got the better of me... or worst. Grade: D-",Bad Boys II
6,hitchcockthelegend,"Bad boys bad boys, what you going to do? Why-make a sequel of course.",7,27 January 2011,"One that was eight years later than the money spinning first film made in 1995. Directed again by Michael Bay, this sequel sees Will Smith and Martin Lawrence joined by Jordi Mollà, Gabrielle Union and Peter Stormare. Plot sees the wise cracking, bickering, buddy cops out to stem the flood of designer ecstasy into Miami. But the lads don't just have the pressures of the job to handle, but also some personal issues too; and the strain is starting to tell on both of them.Lets cut to the chase here, which ironically is what Bay does frequently in this movie, the film is too long, too shallow and devoid of a decent plot. But is it fun? Does it do exactly what one expects of a Michael Bay popcorner? Hell yes it does. Even if after you have peeled your eyes and ears off of the walls-and sifted thru the carnage-you find that more is more is not necessarily a good thing. But hey, on the good side of good is that Messrs Smith & Lawrence still function well as a duo, quipping away and standing tall in the name of machismo. Bay's pyrotechnics are at times incredible, with a Miami freeway pursuit as good as it gets for such entertaining devastation. But the script (Ron Shelton & Jerry Stahl) is often dull, and worryingly sometimes, offensive. Bigger budget means that everything on the film is also bigger, but it's not a better film than the one that went before it.Making back over double its $130 million production budget, the film clearly had enough interested viewers. It also meant that somewhat inevitably a second sequel will surface in the next couple of years after an 8 or 9 year gap. It's hoped that the writers can come up with a cracking plot that's with the times and that Bay can find the right level of action to go with the narrative. 6.5/10",Bad Boys II
7,poolandrews,Loud & noisy action film that doesn't know the meaning of the word subtle...,6,18 January 2008,"Bad Boys II is set in Miami in Florida where PD partners detective Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) & detective Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) are working on a case trying to bring down Cuban drug lord Tapia (Jordi Molla), after a hit is made on a huge shipment of his money they discover that Marcus' sister Theresa (Theresa Randle) is working undercover also trying to bring down Tapia. Que lots of explosions & dead bodies...Directed by Michael Bay who also has a small cameo in the film as the driver of the rubbish car Marcus tires to commandeer before the Mercedes this is the sequel to the successful action thriller comedy Bad Boys (1995) only like all good sequels it's bigger, louder & even more action packed. I must admit I'm in two minds about Bad Boys II, I really am. The predictable script by Ron Shelton & Jerry Stahl goes for the whole mismatched partners who argue & disagree but ultimately stand by each other until the very end no matter what type story with lots of one-liners, sarcastic dialogue & swearing. There's some great action scenes but my main problem with Bad Boys II is the script which is awful. The by-the-numbers plot is as simple as they come, two cops track down drug dealer & blow lots of things up in the process & that's really all there is to it apart from a predictable sub-plot about Marcus' sister being kidnapped (did anyone ever actually think they wouldn't save her?). The main villain is poor, the story is poor & downright silly at times, it goes on for like literally forever at almost two & a half hours & I really despised the the main lead character's Marcus & Mike who swagger around Miami blowing things up, killing & maiming people while cracking jokes without a second thought & even seemingly enjoying it, putting innocent cops & bystanders lives at risk with huge attitudes like they own the place & are above the law. I can't remember seeing an action film which has two more unpleasant, mean spirited & unlikable leads than Bad Boys II, the scene with the kid who wants to take Marcus' daughter out, the scene when they abuse the prisoner as well as numerous others really makes Bad Boys II hard to watch & enjoy. It's certainly not funny either with it's racial insults that the makers seem to think are funny & constant usage of foul language that becomes really tiresome really quickly.While I have absolutely no problem in saying the script is terrible & really unpleasant I will admit that director Bay does a wonderful job here & Bad Boys II has some simply stunning action set-pieces. The action packed freeway chase with crashing cars & speed boats is maybe the best single car chase from the past decade, it's amazing & the scenes with the cars being let off the car transporter & flipping over are incredible. I'm sure a lot of CGI computer effects were used in this sequence but you would never know, it looks brilliant & it's simply exhilarating. There are huge shoot-outs, another two brilliant car chases including one at the end, exploding mansions, some truly wonderful & spectacular stunts & plenty more over-the-top action. That's my dilemma really, generally speaking I hate Bad Boys II as a film with it's cynical & cold character's but I absolutely loved the action scenes & the style Bay brings to the film. So what do I do? There's lots of violence & gun-play so those who don't like that sort of thing should probably steer clear.With a supposed budget of $130,000,000 Bad Boys II certainly wasn't short of money & it show's with some truly outstanding action scenes, some of the best in fact for years. I didn't like the acting at all, Will Smith is alright but Martin Lawrence was awful & he is not an action star. They put in really unlikable performances with plenty of attitude & no sympathy or compassion for anything other than themselves.Bad Boys II is a film which I am in two minds over, I hated the dialogue, the character's & the simplistic plot but loved the hugely impressive action set-pieces. Even though I didn't like it I think I would definitely watch it again though just for the action scenes.",Bad Boys II
8,dbborroughs,Only good in pieces. Some random comments on a bad movie,2,29 December 2008,"This is a well made piece of trash.For all the technical virtuosity this movie stinks There I said it.What is with the writing its awful. Martin Lawrence is given nothing to do.The action scenes are mostly dull, though the car chase about a half hour in is spectacular after a dull gun fight.This is a movie of posturing and posing.The movie works in moments the one chase an odd line here or there but nothing hangs together...Face it we don't really have a villain until an hour in. Until about an hour in the bad guy is just a guy.... awful.Worse is the pacing.Its horrible. This movie runs two and a half hours. I made it in only an hour and a half before I got up and gave up and hit the scan button on the remote. Scenes go on and on and on and on as if they used every sequence they had. The first 80 minutes could loose at least 35 minutes with out a noticeable loss to anything.What makes it all the more painful is it looks good. It looks like it should work, even in the sequences that don't (which is most of them) it looks like this should be working but its not, not by a long shot....Avoid the movie at all cost unless you want to be annoyed.",Bad Boys II
9,lastliberal,"We ride together, we die together. Bad boys for life.",7,23 July 2007,"This is the way Miami Vice is supposed to be: A Ferrari chasing a car carrier on a busy freeway, cars flying everywhere, 20+ cars and a boat totaled. Stupendous! Bullets flying everywhere, cars crashing, bodies dumped on the road, explosions, buildings smashed by SUVs careening down a hill - it all works to add non-stop excitement.Michael Bay (Transformers, The Rock, Armageddon) knows how to make action pictures.Add two real buddies to the mix and you have a movie. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence work a a team to get the bad guys. Gabrielle Union (Cradle to the Grave) was also hot.Come on, guys, let's have a Bad Boys III!",Bad Boys II
10,Calicodreamin,Great action,7,13 November 2019,"Bad boys II is a proper sequel. Not trying too hard to duplicate the first and successfully amping up the action. Smith and Lawrence have great chemistry and deliver on the humor. The action scenes are well coordinated and keep the pace of the movie moving. The plot is well developed and supporting characters are well cast. My only comment would be, again, the movie is just a bit long, some filler scenes could have been cut and the plot streamlined.",Bad Boys II
11,Boba_Fett1138,Woosah!,7,28 December 2005,"""Bad Boys II"" is a late sequel to Michael Bay's successful enjoyable debut movie ""Bad Boys"" from 1995. Hey, but better late than never! Although ""Bad Boys II"" is not as good as the first, it still is a very enjoyable, entertaining popcorn flick with some spectacular action and two great main characters who have some fine chemistry together.This movie is typical Michael Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer stuff, meaning that it's big, loud and just totally over-the-top in its action. Despite what many other people seem to think, I think that Michael Bay is a wonderful director. He knows how to create a big-budget action movie and he does it always with style and lots of sense for entertainment. Plus, his movies have what many other present action movies these days don't have; some good and respected actors in it. So to me it seems, that those who show hate toward Michael Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer movies, don't even like action movies in the first place. ""Bad Boys II"" is no different from any other Michael Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer production and is entertaining and over-the-top, made with an obvious big budget and some wonderful actors in it.However the plot and story for this movie are just totally ridicules. However in this case the movie really is secondary. Primary element of the movie are the two main characters Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowrey, played by Martin Lawrence and Will Smith. They both are highly entertaining character, who show some great duo-chemistry on screen. The characters really carry the movie and are the main reason why this movie is so entertaining to watch. It was also great to see Joe Pantoliano reprising his role as police Captain and Peter Stormare is always enjoyable to watch.There are some truly hilarious scene's in the movie but overall it has a bit too serious undertone at times. ""Bad Boys"" was certainly a movie that was more consistent in its entertainment and humor than this sequel. This is basically the only reason why I don't rate ""Bad Boys II"" as highly as I do ""Bad Boys"".The big budget for this movie is well spend and there are truly some spectacular action sequences that are just completely over-the-top but are wonderful to watch for that very same reason. The action is well filmed and original from mainly a movie-technical point of view.Appreciate the movie for what it is; pure entertainment...and this movie is a very entertaining action-flick alright!7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Bad Boys II
12,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,And this time... it's *personal*!,7,23 November 2006,"This is one of those films where you simply need to know what to expect. I would guess that a large portion of the people who didn't care for it simply expected more(one would wonder why, what with the first film being... well, what it was, which was hardly Shakespeare) from it, or something different than what they got. This is ""dumb"" entertainment, nothing more. There's little of actual substance... there are clichés and there's filler. Added to what the original had of, well, unoriginality, we have the ""personal"" motive(as I allude to in my summary), the utterly despicable villains(the main one being Mexican, looking like he's never heard of showering or the magic of shaving, and probably smelling bad, too) and more. The characters are decently written. The acting is fair. It was nice to see Pantoliano back in the role as the captain. Smith and Lawrence do their thing, much like in the first, and seem to have fun. The cinematography varies, with some shaky-cam in the action scenes, to reasonable effect. The action is quite good... the shootouts are plentiful and cool. The car-chase scene does, in my opinion, not measure up to the one of The Matrix Reloaded, but they had to try, and I'd say they did rather a lot better than Terminator 3. This is a pretty good way to spend two hours... too bad that it's half an hour longer than that. Yes, by that I do mean that it's slightly overlong. In closing... this is pretty run-of-the-mill stuff, but it's good action and fine entertainment. There are a bunch of scenes that are somewhat offensive and unpleasant, and the language is by no means something they held back on. Anyone who are offended by such things should consider skipping this. I recommend this to any fan of the original, Michael Bay, the actors or the genre. Fine for what it is. 7/10",Bad Boys II
13,view_and_review,Bad Boys: Good Movie,7,31 January 2007,"For pure adrenalin and action, BB2 gets high marks. Throw in some pretty funny lines and funny scenes, it gets more high marks. Bad Boys 2 was very comparable to the first one. BB2 did go a little over the top with the drama and the feats that Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) and Mike Lowery (Will Smith) performed; but the amazing feats were overshadowed by the comedy so as to take your mind off of: ""No way is that happening."" I think it was classic how, even in the most dire situations, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence were able to provide laughs. I think that is a lot better than them taking themselves too seriously, because then we'd have to call into question just about every stunt. The ending was a bit of a fizzle. After being somewhat light-hearted and humorous, the movie started to take a serious turn with a supposed portentous and riveting moment. Then there was the whole going into Cuba with a full tactical team thing. Still, BB2 had great car chase scenes, almost ""Heat"" like shootouts, and plenty of laughs.",Bad Boys II
14,gridoon2021,"Belated sequel, flashy enough, but inferior to the original",5,12 April 2008,"""Bad Boys II"" is pure popcorn fare, flashy but empty. The comedy is wildly uneven, ranging from the good (Lawrence swallowing two ""ecstasy"" capsules by accident) to the excruciating (Lawrence, along with Smith, bullying the young boy who's come to take his daughter out on a date), but there are some exhilarating action sequences, the best one of which is probably the almost supersonic car / truck chase on the Miami bridge. Michael Bay knows how to give his films visual punch, and has some cool ideas (like the endlessly circling camera in the shootout with the Haitians); on the other hand, the inside view of a corpse's brain is an image that does not belong in an action movie, even an R-rated one. Lawrence and Smith still have chemistry, but on the whole ""Bad Boys II"" lacks the freshness of the first film. More Gabrielle Union (who should be in the running for the ""Most Beautiful Actress of the Decade"" title) and a somewhat shorter running time would have been improvements. (**)",Bad Boys II
15,ferguson-6,"Kaboom, etc, etc",4,20 July 2003,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Martin Lawrence and Will Smith team up for this remake of the original, funny and successful ""Bad Boys"".  Director Michael Bay turns this into a 2 plus hour marathon of ridiculous gun fights and car chases.  Too many explosions to count and extremely weak banter between the leads and all other characters.  Absolutely nothing of interest here ... even the bad guys are impossible to take seriously.  And what's with the chunky daughter of the drug lord?  Every chase scene and gun fight lasts at least 50% too long.  The crisp dialog between Smith and Lawrence from the original is no where to be found.  This is not worth the time investment.  Best stuff is John Salley as the computer nerd - but even that is over the top.",Bad Boys II
16,FlashCallahan,Woooooossssaaahhhhh....,5,18 December 2014,"The titular pair head up a task force investigating the flow of ecstasy into Miami. Their search leads to a dangerous kingpin, whose plan to control the city's drug traffic has touched off an underground war. Meanwhile, things get a little heated between Mike and Syd, Marcus's sister, which causes a little hostility between the two, and lots of explosions......When this film first came out eleven years ago I thought it was wonderful, loud, and very exciting. But back then, I was 26, and in the demographic for Bay's type of movie.Seeing it again now, it still has some great elements to it, the car chase with the boat explosion is still a thrilling piece of cinema, and the scenes with Marcus under the influence of Ecstasy, and the scene with Mikes daughter's date are still laugh out loud, but there are so many flaws to the movie.Firstly, its way, way too long, by a good forty five minutes, and no matter how many flashy edits, or speeding cars you have, there is a lot of pointless drivel in this movie, and most of it is sexist, and xenophobic humour, that you get in his films now.Still, Smith and Lawrence are great together, and they are clearly enjoying themselves.But just way too long and sexist.",Bad Boys II
17,Mr-Fusion,The magic is gone,3,11 October 2019,"Back in '95, Michael Bay still had checks and balances in place. It's why I enjoyed Bad Boys. His ""Bayisms"" were kept to a minimum, and the movie ran on the Smith/Lawrence chemistry, macho gun battles and slick polish. The Mark Mancina score added loads to the film, and it was pretty funny.Bad Boys II tosses out all of that. Everything is ramped to 11, including the camerawork, hateful dialogue and coked-fueled editing. This is a testament to a director whose id is fully in charge, and this saps all of the humor, fun and entertainment value.It is exhausting.",Bad Boys II
18,StevePulaski,The oppressive cynicism definitely makes it one bad boy,2,7 May 2012,"You could perhaps make collectible trading cards out of the unnecessary, overly-long sequences that exist in Bad Boys II. Is it possible that a mildly pretentious, ridiculous, dim-witted film could get a sequel that is even more pretentious, ridiculous, and dim-witted? When you have a film with Michael Bay's name firmly stamped on the cover, one thing is for certain; there will be booms and a lot of them.This is a tiresome sequel, that becomes long and winded after the first half hour because of its oppressive consumption of self-importance from very early on. This is a film that looks cocky and has nothing to hide. There is a scene in the very beginning of the film where Martin Lawrence gets shot on the cheek of his buttocks and we have to listen to a riveting commentary on how the bullet didn't enter the hole but the cheek and how uncomfortable it will be to sit and how stressful it will be for him to go on. Have mercy.It's scenes like that that make the movie plod along at snail's pace. About halfway through this excursion I came to the consensus that the film was utterly listless, and had absolutely no ambition to be good, entertaining, or anything outside of the cloying genre of a ""popcorn flick."" I sometimes like a good camp movie, but I despise when films use the excuse ""it's an action movie, take it for what it is"" or the long over-stayed ""just turn your brain off."" When you truly think about it, why would a movie want to proclaim itself as a ""turn your brain off"" type piece? Were the writers lazy or was the whole project lacking any form of motivation and ambition. Or was the easy route taken? I'm not sure, but for whatever reason, the film seems to be inherently inept.Again, the story is made complicated by a long run time, numerous dead-on-arrival conversations between criminals, tedious shootouts, astoundingly incoherent car chases, and the constant bickering between two men we are led to believe have been close friends for many years. Detectives Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Smith) return to track down and abolish the smuggling of ecstasy through many underground routes in Florida. You may ask yourself, why does that task take 147 minutes? Because every five, the film is punctuated with either a redundant scream-fest between the detectives or an unacceptable shootout that always results in the same turnout, making it robbed of credible suspense.Bad Boys II wouldn't be so intolerable and unwatchable if it had just improved on three things; one, lee pretentiousness in the direction and the production. Everything looks too production-heavy, incredibly overbearing, and ridiculously glossy as if it was given a paint job by Hollywood. Two, the film's cynical mean-spirit that is carried throughout the entire picture. Multiple scenes have this built up aggression that goes nowhere except right down the drain of despair. And finally, the removal of needless sequences like the one at an electronic store, the one about being shot in places unknown, and the countless number of relentless car chases. This is one of the worst action movies I've seen in a while that didn't involve metal, soulless robot monstrosities.Starring: Martin Lawrence and Will Smith. Directed by: Michael Bay.",Bad Boys II
19,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Again, it's decent, but nothing special for a buddy cop film",6,19 November 2006,"I was looking forward to seeing Bad Boys II, because my friends and on IMDb, it looked like for the most part, most people enjoyed this movie. Not to mention that due to the first Bad Boys movie caused me to have a huge crush on Will Smith. But this movie for some reason didn't work that well for me, I mean, there were a few good moments that made me laugh, but this movie over all seemed kinda hateful for some reason. These two actors just didn't have the light spark like Lethal Weapon or Rush Hour.Marcus and Mike start off busting a horrible KKK meeting, when a shoot out happens, Mike accidentally hits Marcus in the rear with a bullet. Marcus is just about having it with Mike, and Mike is also having a secret relationship with Marcus's sister, Syd, to top that. They now have to uncover a drug and money ring that is being sent around the world through a morgue. But Marcus and Mike need to work things out since Marcus is planning on transferring the police department.Over all, Bad Boys II is a pretty decent action movie, but like I said, something rubbed me off wrong about the film. While it had great action sequences and some pretty funny moments, Will and Martin don't seem to have a certain spark that other buddy cop movies have. But, it's all good if others dig this movie.6/10",Bad Boys II
20,MovieAddict2016,"Just ugly, loud, trashy and not very funny at all.",5,31 August 2005,"I've never liked the original ""Bad Boys"" from 1995 despite its reputation as one of the ""better"" cop-buddy movies out there. In my opinion it's all style over substance and director Michael Bay's annoying use of the sun-drenched, hard-hitting, always-moving camera distracts from the reality of the friendship between Smith and Lawrence's characters. The over-the-top action violence and stupid sex gags make the story seem unrealistic and the characters fake.The sequel isn't much better. It's eight years after the first film (can't believe it took so long for them to cash in on the original) and essentially exactly the same. Smith is still a fashionable playboy who's got it all together. Lawrence is still a neurotic wimp. Their boss (Joe Pantoliano) is still at their throats. The bad guys are still stereotypes, the women are still all beautiful and wearing as little as possible.Even the plot is very similar. They're on the trail of a drug smuggler yet AGAIN. This time the guy hides his drugs in dead bodies and their mission is to take him down and provide enough evidence to incriminate him - so they use a romantic interest to be a mole in the drug lord's operation.Bay's direction is just as bad as before - but now thanks to a much bigger budget, a larger cast and crew and the advent of advanced digital technology, the explosions are bigger, the car chases are longer and more boring, the camera moves even more and never stops zooming and cutting away to other scenes, and so on and so forth.The movie isn't really that funny either. It's just brutally violent for the sake of being so - it tries to add risqué humor and some ""misunderstood events"" to make the film funnier (such as Lawrence and Smith's conversation being displayed on all the TVs in the electronic store), but we've been there, done that already. It's not worth the time or money that was invested into it on both ends. Hopefully there won't be a ""Bad Boys III.""",Bad Boys II

22,KineticSeoul,Has every MIchael Bay trademark in it,6,10 January 2017,"This is the sequel that Michael Bay took it over the top. Some parts are just annoying to sit through, but at least the chase scenes are cool. This is part buddy cop movie and part cop fantasy. In other words this is the movie that will make kids want to be police officers. Not because of what the job really is but because it has a lot of stuff the main duo does that they can't get away with in real life. This is the movie that showcases what Michael Bay is all about. It has just about every trademark Bay is known for all crammed up in one movie. When it comes to the plot, it's probably the worst one yet. It's all basically a set up for the next action scene. Which might work for a video game but as a movie, well it falters. The shootouts seems like it's a copy of John Woo movies but without the riveting emotions and grit to it. Instead it's a sequel that tries to be more of the first one in every area to the point it sometimes gets annoying to sit through. Especially when it comes to the interaction between the two leads. Although Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) is more likable this time around and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) is the one that gets annoying with the over exaggeration. This is a serviceable action movie if you don't care about the plot at all and just want to see kickass chase scenes then it's passable.6.8/10",Bad Boys II
23,Buddy-51,Bad II,3,27 February 2005,"It's hard to imagine that anyone out there could actually have been clamoring for a sequel to 1995's ""Bad Boys."" Yet, eight years later, along came ""Bad Boys II"" to remind us that even the least deserving film can get itself a follow-up, provided it has the right amount of high-powered corporate backing and big enough names in the cast to get the job done. As with most sequels, this one comes replete with a Roman numeral neatly tucked behind its title to give it that extra special touch of class. However, in this case, perhaps the II really stands for ""twice as bad."" This new film, which is indeed even longer, dopier and duller than the original, once again stars Will Smith and Martin Lawrence as two Miami P.D. undercover cops who spend most of their time kvetching at one another in between car chases and shootouts (and often during as well). As this is a Michael Bay film, rest assured that the gun battles and vehicular mayhem have been designed on so grand and epic a scale that we wonder that the entire city of Miami along with a good part of Cuba haven't been reduced to rubble by the time Smith and Lawrence are done doing their thing.The nominal plot involves the partners tracking down a Cuban drug kingpin (yawn) who is smuggling Xtasy to the states hidden inside gutted corpses. This allows for some truly vile humor at the expense of some innocent dead bodies (""Six Feet Under"" this definitely is not). To complicate matters, Lawrence's beautiful kid sister is also working undercover for the NEA and the fretting Lawrence does everything he can to make her job all that much more difficult.The screenplay by Ron Shelton and Jerry Stahl encompasses every cop buddy cliché known to mankind. First, we have the hyper distraught captain who somehow fails to see the genius behind the boys' unconventional crime fighting methods. Then, in place of characterization, the boys engage in a running repartee of stale jokes and tiresome put downs that continues on even though all around them bullets are flying and bodies are piling up. Finally, there is the threatened sundering of the team over petty differences and the equally inevitable patching up of differences at the end. And the humor is so lowbrow that the film lacks even the saving grace of laughter to make it all bearable. Basically, this sequel is just another opportunity for Bay to beat his audience over the head with frenetic editing and mind numbing action.""Bad Boys II"" might have been more aptly named if they had simply dropped the word ""Boys"" out of the title altogether. It would at least have given audiences a more truthful and accurate description of the contents.",Bad Boys II

25,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Bad is right.,3,23 May 2021,"'Bad Boys II (2003)' is just bad. I mean, it's not boring, per se, but it's all just noise, really. There's no substance to it, and its narrative lacks any real sense of pacing or structure. It seems as though the writers just threw every idea they had at the thing and hoped it would form a cohesive whole. Needless to say, it doesn't. It's a bloated series of set-pieces that basically does everything you'd expect it to in an entirely checklist fashion. Its plot is dull and its characters are bland (though brash); it's not compelling at all. It often makes bizarre choices, too. It's really disorienting at times and none of its action is readable. To be honest, it's almost dizzying on occasion (one or two scenes are enough to provoke actual anxiety). It's also just nasty, for lack of a better word. It's sexist, homophobic and, somehow, even a bit racist. Plus, it just perpetuates the really backwards 'macho' mentality that has rightfully come under scrutiny in recent years for being harmful in every conceivable way. It's so backwards that it feels as though it must have been released prior to its predecessor. The one element of the entire affair that could be considered good (as in, above average) is the sheer amount of rather impressive practical destruction on display. Even so the actual action sequences that feature this devastation aren't exciting or, even, all that inspired; they're just a bunch of near incomprehensible shots showing things blowing up. They're probably the best thing about the experience, but they're not exactly entertaining. Nothing about the flick is, frankly. It's a far cry from the first 'Bad Boys (1995)' and is almost the textbook example of the sort of big-budget, brainless blockbuster that critics often malign. It is competent in some ways and its two leads are doing their best with the material. Ultimately, though, it's really bad. 3/10.",Bad Boys II
26,bowmanblue,Have you seen the first one?,7,20 May 2014,"Apparently not many people have. 'Bad Boys II' is one of those rare films which seems to have totally eclipsed the original. Most people seem to have seen the second part without seeing what came before. Therefore, if you're wondering what Part II is like, you really should start by watching the first one. It's basically the same, or at least the same tone. If you like Part I then you'll definitely like Part II.Martin Lawrence and Will Smith play two Miami cops who 'do things their own way.' Yeah, nothing new there. In fact, there's nothing much new about the whole 'Bad Boys' package... and yet it's still soooo much fun. Okay, so you may have to suspend your disbelief slightly – a lot of what happens is probably a little more exaggerated than it would be in real life. However, it's not supposed to realistic – it's just a great film to watch and enjoy.It's about a drugs kingpin who...well, does what evil drugs kingpins do. And Will and Lawrence have to bring him to account. You really don't need to know much about the plot. It has fantastic car chases, wicked shoot-outs and Martin and Will play off each other perfectly. Again, the fact they tend to argue their way through gunfire is just one of many telltale signs that this film isn't supposed to be 'hyper-realistic,' but, what the hell, it makes a good film.Don't let the fact that it was directed by Michael Bay put you off. It was done waaaay before the travesty that is the Transformers franchise. Just put your brain to one side and enjoy the craziness and general banter between Martin Lawrence and Will Smith. If you want 'realism' in police drama, watch a reality TV cops show. If you want overblown shoot-outs, car chases and beautiful scenery – you know where to come!",Bad Boys II
27,ThomasDrufke,How Long?,5,28 January 2020,"It is beyond belief why Columbia/Sony greenlit this film with a 130 million dollar budget, nearly 7 times the budget as the first film. And if it weren't for a few genuinely funny scenes, this bloated sequel nearly killed the franchise. Some would say it did kill the series until it was revived this year with Bad Boys For Life. This is what happens when you give Michael Bay a massive budget and creative freedom. No action film not directed by Christopher Nolan or produced by Marvel should have a running time of 2hrs and 32min and yet here we are. The action scenes drag on for far too long, as does the movie. Let's just say we're lucky that Sony execs were smart enough to not give Bay the opportunity to do the 3rd film from the directors chair.5.3/10",Bad Boys II
28,Cineanalyst,Reckless Excess,4,20 July 2020,"""Bad Boys II"" may be the most Michael Bay of Michael Bay movies. On top of that, there's the compatible excessive vulgarity of producer Jerry Bruckheimer and the broad schtick of Will Smith and Martin Lawrence returning as the eponymous cop buddies. These are the bad boys, indeed. Moreover, being made shortly after 9/11 seems to have given license to be all the more crass and violent as long as everything is wrapped in some conspicuous jingoism.So, of course, the scenario is both a formulaic and convoluted, resulting in an entirely undeserved overlong runtime of nearly two-and-a-half hours, with another drug bust complicated by the family and romantic issues of the detective duo. Additionally, just when one might expect it all, including rather needless subplots involving a Russian mobster/nightclub owner and the Ku Klux Klan, to be resolved with a warrant turning into a stand-off in Miami, we're, instead, given a trip of extended foreign adventurism to rescue the damsel-in-distress from Cuba, where the bad boys, after fighting off and fleeing from the Cuban army, drive a Humvee through village shacks--explosions all the way, obviously--to the safety of Guantanamo Bay, of all places.The bungling dolts of an excuse for policemen in the first ""Bad Boys"" (1995), too, are transformed here into something more nefariously effective. Oh, they're still bad cops, but I think I see the purpose in their madness here--violating the law at every turn, from blatant excessive force--they even point a gun at the face of an innocent teenager and threaten him with death and rape in one scene just to scare him for a date with one of their daughters (hilarious, no?)--and destruction of property on a scale that would ruin a municipal budget, to illegal searches and wiretapping that neglect any chances of bringing convictions against any of the baddies and car chases and shootouts with military-grade weapons on public streets and in homes that would be most shocking if they didn't result in massive casualties of civilians. See, they're action junkies, as is, presumably, the audience for such a movie. No need for convictions if you, instead, kill all the suspects. And, as for those pesky rights, such concerns are relegated to the ravings of Klansmen in this post-9/11 bloodbath.As far as the original ""Bad Boys"" was remarkable besides for excessive explosions and garish filmmaking announcing Bay's debut, it was for the relatively innocuous treatment (the broad comedy of characters screaming their lines aside) and featuring of two black men for a buddy-cop flick. Well, any tact there is tossed aside here, too, for the team of white writers to insert some stupid racially-charged jokes between the black and Hispanic partners, respectively, on the police force, with white supremacists placed as a side gag restricted to the KKK. Smith even grabs a 40 of beer before waving his gun about to affect a racial stereotype of an ex-con for that scene of scaring a teenager (still hilarious, no?). This is placed beside the series' continuation of homophobic humor, with Smith and Lawrence's characters, once again, being mistaken by someone for gay lovers. The rest of the comedy here tends, at best, to be just not funny. For instance, it'll be too soon if I ever see Lawrence pretending to be high of ecstasy again.As crass as all this is, I do hold a level of admiration for how thoroughly Bay and company infuse the picture with their style, borrowed from other films though it may be, and ideology. With the possible exception of the ""Transformers"" franchise, Bay may never have been as unleashed and reckless in his entire oeuvre of cinematic excess as in ""Bad Boys II."" Surely, this being a sequel helped, allowing to expand upon an already familiar formula, which was already cliché to begin with, and including the globe-trotting common of second installments whereby a detour to Cuba may seem to make some sense here. Newfound appeals for foreign adventurism and violence after 9/11 doubtlessly contributed, too. Regardless, the results are some extensive car chases--cars and corpses dropped as road blocks along the way--and repeated shootouts and explosions. In conjunction with better placement and more restrained use of those slow-motion shots continued from the first movie and despite the introduction of some poses for rotating pans and relatively-lengthy zoom effects shots here, the cutting is even quicker in this sequel. As per film historian Barry Salt, this one has an average shot length (ASL) of 2.23 seconds, to come below the already-frenetic pace of a 2.8 ASL for ""Bad Boys."" Despite featuring Téa Leoni in a tiny skirt through most of the first movie, too, Bay and company hadn't yet then mastered the gratuitous up-skirt inserts and tracking shots of women's posteriors, but by the sequel they'd mastered the objectification of the opposite sex through the male gaze.Clearly, there's a market for such action comedies that display so nakedly such merits of supposed machismo with relentless lack of reflection. There's an understandable guilty pleasure to it, and although Bay and company's burgers aren't to mine or many critics' liking, there's a craft to it, and this is one of their most consistently effective efforts in that coarse excess.",Bad Boys II

Basically, this movie is about the police trying to stop drug transportation.Overall, this is not a bad movie. I hate it when people rip off Michael Bay.

30,CuriosityKilledShawn,"The most disgusting, xenophobic and irresponsible film I have ever seen!",1,6 May 2004,"Give a five year old a movie camera and tell him to film playing cowboys and Indians with Tonka trucks and you have Bad Boys II, a disgrace that somehow took 8 years to reach fruition. It's probably the most racist, homophobic and degrading experience you'll ever see. I don't even think Michael Bay knew he was making such a movie which only adds to his incompetence.
The basic logic of the movie is something like this, if you are a cop then it is okay to kill as many people as you want in the most brutal way possible (inadvertently causing our 'heroes' to become fascists, bigots and subliminally eviler than the main villain). There is also subtext, something along the lines of; all ethnic minorities are either murderers, drug dealers or some kind of foul human being and all country-dwellers are inbred, racist Klan members. The movie spews hate in the faces of every audience member who has been misled into believing they are watching an action-comedy.Miami is a place with a very diverse ethnic population and I think it is completely irresponsible for the filmmakers to have behaved in this way. Maybe a five year old with a movie camera would have been too grown up to have allowed this.As you can tell by one of my older reviews, Bad Boys was hardly a unique or original movie but it worked because the style made up for the lack of intelligence and Mark Mancina's musical score was very strong. It gave every scene a beat, tied them together and sounded mighty cool. Well, that is gone! Mancina's buddy Trevor Rabin took over scoring duties for this movie and the cool Bad Boys theme is completely gone and replaced with an endless and dull drone. In fact I would suggest that the score for this movie doesn't actually exist.And there are far too many unnecessary scenes of absolutely nothing that contribute in no way to the already clichéd plot (drug dealers, oooohhhh that's not been done before). It proves that Bay was given far, far too much time and money to do whatever he wanted. The result? A 2.5 hour mess of unremarkable car chases (also highly original, you'd never expect an action movie to have a car chase would you?), constant, unironic profanity and sexism.And can someone tell me how the slimy main villain seemed have constant stubble without ever growing a beard? Several days pass by, he doesn't shave and he never grows a beard. The movie would have you believe that all Cubans are this way. A pretty bad representation methinks. Trust me it's not that way in real life. For all this movies attempts at hardcore action the mix with cartoonish violence comes off as incongruous. This is not a no-brainer. It's a racist pile of trash that can be labelled a no-brainer as a desperate last-minute excuse by Michael Bay.It took FIVE writers to come up with this. The fact that they or Michael Bay have been playing Grand Theft Auto:Vice City far too much is clearly evident. Almost every single part of this movie is stolen from some part of that game. From locations, to car, situations, characters and plots. And still it is no.",Bad Boys II

Interesting, of course, in that the movie does something so unique and memorable in arguably its worst scene. As you sit through this overly long sequel to the smash 1995 hit, watch for a scene near the end where the movie itself and it's progressive quality can be seen personified in the manifestation of a bright yellow H2. Now, as you know, the original Hummer is probably the most badass off-road vehicle ever created by mankind, while the H2 is remodeled to appeal to soccer moms, emerging as the most inefficient minivan on earth. So your first reaction at this scene may be shock at seeing an H2 actually being taken off the pavement, but try to look past that. What this scene represents is the movie itself (as the H2) not necessarily falling off a cliff, but certainly zooming rapidly down a precipitous drop-off.The thing that I really appreciate about Bad Boys II is that it provides so many opportunities to use its scenes to illustrate its intentions and the mental state of its target audience. I recently saw Scary Movie 3 in theaters, which served to remind me what a glorious and successful decision it was not to see Bad Boys II in theaters. I learned in Scary Movie 3 the importance of considering a film's target audience before paying real money to surround yourself with a whole theater full of these people. The film starts off with a scene involving an extremely advanced siege of a drug smuggling ring who are importing massive quantities of Ecstasy into the US through Miami. As the elite team surrounds the perpetrators, afraid to move in too soon and spoil their bust, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence pop out of their KKK costumes to point a gun in each hand at the villains and break into song. As they sing the Bad Boys theme for the first of half a dozen groan-inducing times throughout the film, you realize the importance of this bust happening at a Klu Klux Klan meeting.Now, I realize that much of this film's target audience is black, which is perfectly fine, but this illustrates something of the opinion of director Michael Bay and producer Jerry Bruckheimer about these people. Obviously, the two don't think very highly of their clientele as they construct this scene to appeal to the hatred of whites generated so successfully and so completely by rap music. This is not a blanket statement about all rap, but as long as there is rap music in the world, there will also be hate. Clearly, the presence of massive quantities of drugs and drug money among these backwards rednecks is not enough, they have to be KKK members for their punishment (as their `capture' can really be described in no other way) to be fully satisfying to the audience. I'm only half white myself (hence my last name), but the KKK is one of the most embarrassing blemishes on the history of the white man (along with slavery, a seemingly relentless sense of self-entitlement, and Vanilla Ice), and I really see no reason to have them updated in a huge Hollywood blockbuster. Keep in mind that there really are still people backwards enough to believe in and be members of remnants of the KKK, just like there are people living today who are so detached from reality that they don't believe the Nazi Holocaust ever happened. They don't care how they're portrayed, this is all publicity for them.So the movie thankfully moves on from the KKK and, shockingly enough, MOSTLY from race jokes. In fact, there is something to be said of their ability to make a movie that featured Martin Lawrence without peppering it with endless race jokes. The makers of National Security were not so lucky. Not lucky at all. But if you boil down the plot and compare it to the lengthy, explosive action sequences and, more importantly, the length of the movie, it becomes clear that the movie was made for little other reason than to allow Michael Bay two and a half hours of opportunities to construct action scenes. However bad the movie was, Bay certainly knows how to make an action sequence.The movie is about a drug lord smuggling lethal Ecstasy into the country and two renegade cops trying to stop him. They have to break rules to do this, by the way, which is why they have to do it on their own. Luckily, many of the Hell's-Angels-turned-Miami-PD enlist themselves to help. There are some complications, like Marcus's (Lawrence) sister being involved in another plot to bring down the drug ring, the fact that machine guns are worthless for bad guys AND good guys, and the drug ring's interesting tactic of importing the drugs inside cadavers. Lots of gross-out possibilities there!There is, actually, one genuinely amusing scene in the morgue where Mike (Smith) is reaching around inside the cadavers searching for drugs and money while Marcus struggles to maintain his composure and keep his lunch down, but unfortunately most of the rest of the comic relief falls beneath the acceptable bad taste level. You have lots of  dumb one-liners (many of which are talentlessly used during car chase scenes in true 2 Fast 2 Furious fashion) and other unique but equally just flat-out dumb scenes, like a scene where the movie halts in its tracks long enough for Marcus and Mike to forget that they are cops and act like wannabe gangsters when some poor teenager comes over nicely dressed to take Marcus's daughter on a date. They threaten him, search him, interrogate him, Mike even pulls a gun and waves it around like a complete idiot and asks him if he has ever or would like to have sex with a man. WOW.Roger Ebert claims that the movie employed no less than four writers. Another professional film critic claimed that there were no less than seven, the IMDb names five. Either way, none of them did anything. Consider this scene, consider the one-liners shouted during car chases, consider the fact that none of the massive amounts of damage inflicted on people and property matter, that it only becomes `real' when Marcus's sister is taken hostage. If this is what you have to be able to come up with to be a screenwriter in Hollywood, I've been wasting my time. I graduated from college three days ago, and watching this movie taught me that I only need maybe a seventh grade education to make it in screenwriting. This has resulted in a severe alteration of my career goals (not that screenwriting was ever very high on my priority list).Bad Boys II is big, loud, dumb, ugly, frenetic, arrogant, egotistical, misogynistic, racist, and preposterous. Joe Pantoliano has an interesting role as the police chief of Miami PD, massively stressed out by the constant and extensive damage regularly created by two of his officers, as well as the fact that he can't fire them, as any thinking police chief would, because then there would be no movie. There is a weak attempt to make Marcus three dimensional by having him participating in therapy to cope with the stress he deals with on the job (Mike is clearly less affected, as he simply has sex with his therapist), which results in nothing more than some allegedly funny scenes in which he starts pulling his earlobes and chanting. Yawn.There is absolutely nothing new or original in Bad Boys II. A lot of conventional scenes changed slightly to add the illusion of originality to a script that is a tired rehash of every action film to come out in the last 15 years, and unfortunately the only thing that's added is bad taste. The villain, for example, is a thinly disguised embodiment of some mixture of Al Pacino's Scarface and every single James Bond villain, and car chases add little more than a gross-out effect, arguably the weakest technique that exists in any kind of filmmaking. Things have been thrown at police during car chases for decades. Bad Boys II come up with the clever idea of throwing dead bodies during heavy traffic in downtown Miami, which are then run over and dismembered by the speeding cars in pursuit. Real clever there, guys. Dropping cars off of the speeding semi was pretty good, but this small gleaming morsel of cleverness is buried deep within a two and a half hour muddled mess of dismal distasteful trash.Sadly, the original Bad Boys has been followed up by a grinding sequel that has sunk so low that it seems to be trying to recreate the `success' of the piece of cinematic feces that is 2 Fast 2 Furious. The only thing that has been recreated, however, is that if all of the idiot dialogue like `Oh it's on now,' or `You want play like that?' or `I got something for you brawww,' or `Oh no you did NOT!,' and all of the unnecessary and pointless scenes were taken out, each film would be less than 15 minutes long. Bad Boys II, just like its mentor, is a massive failure.",Bad Boys II
42,FiendishDramaturgy,Inferior but enjoyable BB sequel,8,3 January 2004,"Okay, I agree with the ""professional"" critics on this one. It is not the same caliber as the first installment of this would-be franchise. The first was more along the lines of Lethal Weapon & Tango and Cash. This one was a more serious action, rather than the comedy most of us expected. Not meeting the expectations of the fan base is solely why this movie was rated so badly. This is NOT a bad attempt, by any measure.The car chases were not obligatory car chases, they were well written and believably executed, rather than mindless crashes and explosions. The gun fights were not just the typical Saturday afternoon at the matinée fare, there was a reason behind it. The one liners were used less, and the meaningful dialog was used more.This film has been dogged for being racially prejudiced, homophobic, and just plain bad. I disagree. I found Betty White's lines in Bringing Down the House to be far more offensive than this. The porcine woman with the tremendous breasts telling Smith and Lawrence, ""Y'all mofo's need to find Jesus!"" is the typical kind of closed-minded bigoted harassment most gay men are subjected to by the Christian masses. Many times by their own families! That was nothing new. That does not in any way excuse that horrible behavior, but for the most part, the homosexual community at large does possess the ability to laugh at themselves, and those who are ignorant enough to say such things. So get over yourselves.The ""bad guys"" were all of other national origins than American. Is that racist? Not when most of the police officers were of origins other than American, as well. I suppose that was racist, too? You can't have it both ways.This attempt was fun, with quality action, a creative dialog, and a very entertaining fast-paced story which moved right along to a satisfying ending.It rates an 7.9/10 from...the Fiend :.",Bad Boys II
43,elshikh4,Heavy Going !,1,7 December 2009,"After many unfortunate movies, like (Wild Wild West), (Ali) and (Men in Black II), (Will Smith) needed a hit. At the same time, (Martin Lawrence) after so many wrong choices, needed also a hit (and he still does!). So why not they both return to the lucky title that brought them fame earlier. It was a comic action that proved itself as a hit in 1995. But the sequel that they made was close to a hit to our faces more than anything else!As for the action, it's monstrously violent; with bursting blood, torn-off limbs, and a dictionary in profanity. As for the comedy, aside from the matter of (Lawrence) being mistakenly shot in the start, it's extremely nasty. Enough to tell you that what this movie thinks as funny includes: corpses being thrown in the street, being crashed by a car, being disrobed in a morgue, and yeah.. rats having sex!! Even (Joe Pantoliano)'s nervousness was dull, and recycled from 100 previous movies. Add, to all of that, having an overblown plot too; with a smart evil guy, an idiot evil guy, a war between them, another war between them both and the good guys, an undercover mission, a search for the truth, and a difficult love story between (Smith) and (Lawrence)'s sister; which produced a TWO HOURS AND A HALF LONG MOVIE (even India stopped making movies that long!)At times, I felt that director (Micheal Bay)'s desire was making a buddy-action realistic epic; with so drastic violence, much - no comic - dialogue, and a scene where the men of the SWAT team are talking proudly about the powers of their motherlands (which suits a Seven Samurai kind of tale!). Sure, producing something serious out of what's supposed to be funny action flick is ambitious, but this is the wrong way to do it.At other times, I felt that (Bay) wanted the biggest blockbuster ever made; with endless car chases, plenty of helicopters, and non-stop explosions. But eventually it looked like a movie with a potbelly. (Bay) should have eliminated at least half an hour. For little instance, I don't know why the storyline of the Russian guy in the first place. Let alone that his blockbuster ended up as bloody popcorn, bad ""bad boys"" movie, or simply anything but a funny action flick!In a word: when you go to a movie of that kind to watch people get exploded into halves, so you must be shocked, sick, and most of all deceived. Not even (Amir M. Mokri)'s dazzling cinematography can make up for it. I'm sorry to say it, but this is not as good as the first movie; which wasn't a very good movie in the first place. Next time, I'll maybe watch the action sequences only. Or maybe there'll be no ""next time"" originally!What ever happened to the buddy-movies lately?!",Bad Boys II
44,Polaris_DiB,Wow. I don't care.,3,18 February 2006,"Long, tedious action adventure with repetitive dialog, bad plot holes, and generally boring characters is how to describe this little foray into following up the characters from Bad Boys.Marcus and Mike are out about, trying to find some ecstasy they've been alerted about. They get into a bunch of fights, a bunch of car chases, they get in trouble, they argue with each other. Then they go and they get into another fight, then they get in trouble, only this time they argue with each other first. Then they argue with each other, then get into a fight, then get in trouble. Then they get into trouble, argue with each other, and get into a fight. The fights? The same thing, over and over again. Marcus is upset because he feels his life is in danger. Mike is upset because he feels Marcus is bringing in negative energy. They parody relationship therapy.There's another thing happening. It's this Cuban antagonist. We don't really care about him, really. He just kind of runs around, being Cuban and evil and all. Then we get to see him get angry at people. Then he becomes devious. Then he becomes malicious and angry again.So we watch, for over two hours, with just enough action to keep it moving. Action that involves a certain camera movement, then a reverse shot, then the same camera movement, then the same reverse shot, then the same camera movement, then the same reverse shot... The only truly interesting action scene occurred in that house with the Rastafarians, with that spinning camera thing. That was pretty clever. That's why this film got any stars at all from me.Really, all I got from this film was the feeling that the filmmakers were trying to make the Bad Boys series, if there will ever be one (probably...) into the Lethal Weapon series. I also got a lot of stuff about terrible psychoanalysis which was, to me, Michael Bay telling the world that male attraction to action adventure movies is not some weird psychoanalitical crazy mess, but just good natured fun. Which is why the movie got a bit more of a higher rating from me.Otherwise, wow, was that tedious.--PolarisDiB",Bad Boys II
45,ebiros2,First movie where bonus features were more interesting than the main story,4,7 October 2005,"Bad Boys II was the first DVD I've seen where the bonus disk was more interesting than the main feature. Director Michael Bay came off the shooting of Pearl Harbor and was ready to do more with the CGI in the car chase scene and all the action sequences.The outrageous car chase scene of course was shot in composites of CGI and real cars, but I was surprised to know that the ""real"" cars were the ones that was getting thrown off the trailer, and the cars dodging them were the CG. Then there's the scene of Hummer driving through the mansion with explosions going off everywhere. This was a real house that was getting demolished which they took hold of for the filming of this movie.The movie itself is pretty good, but I'm little bit tired of movie plots where Will Smith is showboating from beginning to end as he does in all his movies. Him and Kevin Cosner must have a clause in their contract saying ""I would have to be portrayed as a hero and look good in all my scenes."" What detectives Burnett and Lowrey does and says arn't a good role model for youngsters who watches this movie, and I suspect that's why this movie doesn't get (much) air time on network television. Cinematography is great and casting is good. Like the first Bad Boys, this is a great movie to see if you like action.If you're out to buy or rent this movie, do yourself a favor and get the double disc edition where it comes with the bonus feature disk. I'm sure you'll be twice as entertained.",Bad Boys II
46,kevin_robbins,Overall this isn't quite as good as the first film but a fun sequel that is a must see for action genre fans,8,17 November 2021,"Bad Boys II (2003) is a movie in me DVD collection that I recently rewatched on HBOMAX. The storyline for this takes place a few years after the previous picture with Marcus sick of shootouts and pointless action all of the time. Meanwhile Mike is dating Marcus's sister, who is a New York detective, and Mike doesn't want Marcus to know. When a case Mike and Marcus are working on collides with a case Marcus' sisters is working on things are bound to get hairy.This movie is directed by Michael Bay (Transformers) and stars Will Smith (Men in Black), Martin Lawrence (Black Knight), Gabrielle Union (Bring It On), Peter Stormare (Fargo), Theresa Randle (Spawn), Michael Shannon (Take Shelter) and Joe Pantoliano (The Matrix).The storyline for this picture is really entertaining with a lot of fun twists and turns. The KKK shootout was a fantastic opening and great way to start the picture with comedy and action. The whoosah references was also fun. The action scenes in this were once again out of this world, especially the car chases. The ending in Cuba was a bit over the top but fun...and the soundtrack was outstanding.Overall this isn't quite as good as the first film but a fun sequel that is a must see for action genre fans. I'd score this an 8/10 and strongly recommend it.",Bad Boys II

This movie has everything: chases, explosions, blood and bodies everywhere, and jokes; some people have attacked this movie for all of these things.  But then what summer action movie doesn't have these qualities?  True there isn't much of a plot either and the movie is two and half hours long.  These are only minor grievances and I enjoyed it a lot, despite having low expectations in the first place.",Bad Boys II
48,alindsay-al,An Average forgettable action movie,5,20 January 2020,"So after watching the first Bad Boys film, it is now time to watch Bad Boys 2 so this is my opinion on this film. The premise of the film sees our two heroes have to bust a drug cartel.
Main Character
Will Smith & Martin Lawrence are so good in their roles in these Bad Boys films, their chemistry is off the charts and you feel like they are legitimate friends in this film. Their characters have a bit more tension in this film but it is when they are bantering it is so entertaining to watch and it makes you really care about what is going on to them.Supporting Characters
Joe Pantoliano is back as the captain and his role is slightly smaller in this film but again he is really funny in the role and I just liked his dynamic with Lawrence and Smith. However, I wasn't a big fan of anybody else in the film, Gabrielle Union plays Smith's girlfriend in the film and she just doesn't do much in the film. Her character is pretty bland and I felt like she caused unnecessary tension between the two main characters that didn't really need to be there. Similar to the first film the bad guy is just really bland and boring, he is just a guy they have to take down and you don't really care why they have to take him down. This film even wastes the great Peter Stormare by giving him a by the numbers basic role in the film.
Story
This film's story tries to add some emotional depth to the main characters but they botch it really, it doesn't really go anywhere in the film and it doesn't really add depth to the characters. Also as mentioned the plot isn't exactly exciting as the bad guys are so generic that the stakes don't feel particularly high and I just didn't really care about it, plus the ending is pretty abrupt with more questions needing to be answered.
Script
The humour in this fim is pretty much as good as the first film and had me laughing quite a bit as Lawrence and Smith have excellent chemistry together and really bring the laughs to the film. But as mentioned before the drama just falls short even though there is a genuine attempt to make it work in this film it just misses the target and it doesn't make you care about the characters problems.
Style
The action scenes in this film are really good, maybe a bit too much slow mo used but it is fun and exciting to watch both the gun fights and the car chases in this film, plus I liked the different locations used in this film, it made it feel different from the first film. However, the pacing of this film is just all over the place, I couldn't believe this film was 2 hours and 30 mins, easily a half an hour could have been cut from the film and nobody would have complained and the film would have been much better.
Overall
Overall this is a pretty average action movie, it is not as good as the original and a pretty by the numbers films. The main characters chemistry is what holds the film up but it is not enough to save this film from being a pretty forgettable experience.",Bad Boys II
49,mattkratz,The boys are back!,7,5 November 2020,"This was a decent sequel as Will Smith and Martin Lawrence reunite to battle a drug kingpin in Miami. The original was better, but this holds its own with plenty of chases, explosions, an ok plot, and a cameo from Dan Marino. The chemistry from the two leads is still there, but the film is a bit overlong but not bad. If you liked the series, give this a try!** 1/2 out of ****",Bad Boys II
50,jimbo-53-186511,"Quite enjoyable, but a definite step down from the first film",5,21 January 2021,"When unorthodox police officers Mike Lowry and Marcus Burnett learn that a drug lord is smuggling drugs into Miami they set about discovering the identity of this 'Mr Big.' in their own unique and chaotic manner. Things turn slightly complicated when Mike and Marcus learn that Marcus' sister Syd is working undercover for the DEA to try to gather evidence against 'Mr Big' and both Marcus and Mike become concerned for Syd's safety...One of the strongest components of Bad Boys 2 is Will Smith and Martin Lawrence; despite notable weaknesses in this film they both put in top-notch performances and watching them do their 'shtick' when interrogating or arresting perps is always highly entertaining. It's a testament to both Lawrence and Smith that they are so good here as the film would be a much lesser film without the flamboyant display that they both put on here. Jordi Molla is also a pretty decent villain (he has a crazy look about him here that somehow makes him appear more convincing in his respective role). I'm pretty sure I've seen him in other villainous roles in films in the past, but couldn't name the films specifically. Then you have Michael Bay's 'marmite' directing here which I'm sure will appease and appal in equal measure. For me Bay gets the balance right here providing us with some of his style that we have become accustomed to without overdoing things.Those things aside, I have to admit that there are some areas where I found Bad Boys 2 didn't work quite as well as the first film; for a start, the main story took far too long to really get going and wasn't quite as involving as the narrative in the first film. The second problem lies with the length of this film - I've no idea why it needed to run for 2 hours and 20 minutes and I'm sure parts of it could have been trimmed here and there.There were a couple of scenes that did have me laughing though; the scene with Marcus and Mike in the TV store when they don't realise they are recording themselves and find themselves inadvertently being broadcast on every TV in the shop and the scene where Reggie arrives to go on a date with Marcus' daughter and Mike and Marcus give him a grilling. These 2 amusing scenes did lift the film slightly when the focus comes off the overlong narrative.Truth is though if you liked the first film then you should still enjoy this film; after all many components from the first film have been transferred to the sequel. Personally though I wish the story had been a tad more involving and a bit shorter as it probably would have been as good as the first film rather than being slightly inferior.",Bad Boys II

54,aidanratesmovies,"Stupid, but fun",8,1 February 2020,"Although Lawrence and Smith provide great chemistry throughout, Bad Boys II does suffer from many of the problems that bogged the first one down, while still proving to be a somehow more entertaining experience than before. Michael Bay provides his usually clunkiness behind the screen, with thin characters, heavy handed directing, and frustratingly shotty action sequences. However, the film does prove to be rather enjoyable at times, with some surprisingly humorous moments and some ridiculous, but fun, moments throughout. The villain and other characters prove to be rather thin, but this is expected, and although it may not be appreciated, it doesn't get in the way of providing a good time. Bad Boys II is far from a perfect action film, but it is an enjoyable and guilty pleasure filled one with plenty to offer if buddy cop films are your thing.

55,questl-18592,Bay Boys 2: Bay Harder,7,2 January 2020,Bad Boys 2 is basically what you'd expect. Everything from the original gets amped up. The story is more ridiculous and less contained.

57,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A standard followup to a more promising start,5,28 June 2020,"When Michael Bay, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence landed on screen with their first action outing in Bad Boys (1995), it's quite possible not many realized at the time how this would take them forward. Will Smith would soon end his career with The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and go onto other blockbuster films like Men In Black (1997). Martin Lawrence though would continue mainly with comedic roles starring in films like Big Momma's House (2000). As for Michael Bay he would stick two more money makers with The Rock (1996) and Armageddon (1998). It wouldn't only be until 2003 that these three converged again on this sequel much of which fans were anticipating. Unfortunately, it's not as great a followup due to a number of reasons.Written by newcomers to the franchise Jerry Stahl and Ron Shelton, the script for this sequel is average at best. The main reason for this is that it gets bogged down with too much inconsistent direction. Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) are still working together, but it seems lately Lowrey is being more reckless than usual. Finally, Marcus feels he needs to distance himself from Mike. Meanwhile, a Cuban drug lord named Tapia (Jordi Mollà) is working to smuggle as much of his drugs and money in a short period of time and the cops' Captain Howard (Joe Pantoliano) wants to understand all the wreckless behavior going on lately.This is the condensed version of the plot. There actually doesn't seem to be much more in story, but the length at which this is drawn out is laborious. Bad Boys (1995) runtime was two hours and while it was long, it did have a number of entertaining things going for it. Here, now clocking in at two and half hours, the execution feels padded. There's also a subplot revolving around some Russian (Peter Stormare) who's in on it with Tapia but this doesn't go anywhere. There's even another subplot about Mike Lowrey hooking up with Marcus' sister Syd (Gabrielle Union). It's all just Michael Bay's attempt at comedy and/or character development because the way it happens feels forced just because.This leads to the comedic aspects of the film being ho-hum. The kinds of jokes thrown around in the film is okay to flat. It's really hit and miss because of how lackluster it feels. Thankfully, the chemistry between Will Smith and Martin Lawrence feel authentic. They both play well off each other and it seems like both had a good time. The thing is, while their chemistry works,...it's the way the script was written that doesn't allow them to shine like they did in the first film. That's also not to say the other cast members don't try. Theresa Randle returns as Marcus' wife, an early Michael Shannon, Yul Vazquez and Jason Manuel Olazabal all have small roles to play. Jordi Mollà is probably one of the most uninteresting villains in a while.Visually the cinematography is well shot and has vastly improved over the work from the first film. One of the small improvements. Shot by Amir Mokri who before this worked on Pacific Heights (1990), further shows the audience all kinds of scenic shots. The action was also very enjoyable; which usually doesn't fail a Bay film. Sadly, music was a downgrade. Due to creative differences between Mark Mancina of the first film and Michael Bay, Mancina was replaced with Trevor Rabin. And it's not that Rabin is a bad composer, because he has made good music. But here, he followed Bay's direction which lacked any kind of thematic material the first score contained. Leaving the sequel with no kind of musical identity. Sigh.As a sequel, it will entertain the fans who enjoyed the first film. However, for those looking for a little more than the same, it will feel pretty average with generic music, inconsistent comedic elements and an over bloated run time. The only thing that has remained credible is the improved camerawork, fun action sequences and good chemistry between actors.",Bad Boys II

59,Rob_Taylor,"Mindless action, if you like that sort of thing.",5,3 May 2004,"I finally got around to seeing this movie a few months ago, and now I've finally gotten around to writing a review of it. The trouble is, just like the original Bad Boys, I have no real memories of it to write about and the thought of watching it again fills me with a kind of dread.There are two things I do recall about the movie. Firstly, a pretty decent car chase and something about a boat on the road. That seems to me to be a good memory.Secondly, and less pleasant a memory (in fact downright unpleasant) is Martin Lawrence. I can't be the only person to think that the current trend amongst black actors to squeal, show the whites of their eyes and panic a lot in films is an intensely irritating one. For lack of a better scapegoat, I'm going to blame the Wayans brothers for starting this, though Chris Rock (or squealer, as he is known round my way) is perhaps the greatest practitioner of it. Now and again, this behaviour is very funny, but when the actor in question does it constantly throughout a film it is aggravating in the extreme. Not only that, but I have to say I find it somewhat demeaning towards black people in general.Anyway, back to BB2. Well, the fact that I remember so little of it, so short a time after seeing it, tells me that, no matter how good the car chases might have been, the film as a whole was instantly forgettable. In fact, the only real memory of it is a negative one (Lawrence's panic act).One last point regarding Lawrence.... what the Hell happened to him? He seems to have quadrupled in size between the films. What's that all about?Anyway, mindless action and violence if that's your cup of tea, then this is a good movie, if you can stand the squealing.",Bad Boys II
60,Luigi Di Pilla,Better than the first one but too long and boring...,5,13 May 2004,"I liked it much better than the first Bad Boys. The dialogs had lot of fun and they made many jokes. But after repeating always the same words you have seen enough. There are two or three big action scenes with cars that were remarkable and pushed my adrenalin higher. That´s all. The story was therefore too long and boring. I am disappointed because I expected more suspense time. I hope the producer and director will create more intelligent blockbusters in future. But it seems they make brain washing with the younger audience that don´t expect too much from a so called action movie. I hope you will understand what I mean and I hope that the persons concerned are reading my lines. I want to see finally movies such as ARMAGGEDON or PEARL HARBOR! I have the impression that Hollywood films get worse and worse. Sorry, but it deserves not more than 5/10. Not for my DVD collection. Too overrated on IMDb.",Bad Boys II

64,rivertam26,A wild but expected ride,7,15 January 2020,"Way over the top and a little forced but still entertaining. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are still as fun as ever. But the little bit of story is less engaging mostly because the action setpieces are so over the top it takes away from the effect. This time around Lawrence's sister played by a decent Gabriele Union is a DEA agent who finds herself in the middle of a dangerous Cuban money laundering situation. Some of the jokes feel a little forced and it all runs a bit long at 147 Mins. Still the movie is fun but I wish they brought back Tea Leoni she kind of balanced the pair. Of course Michael Bay amps up the explosions, sex appeal and a gratuitous amount of gore for better or worse. Theres definitely a question of taste at times especially when they're throwing out corpses on the highway. It feels like a bit much. That being said Will Smith is in gorgeous shape and Lawrence definitely steps up his physical game which makes for a wild but expected ride.",Bad Boys II

67,IonicBreezeMachine,"Loud, obnoxious, juvenile, mean spirited exercise in excess that even the talents of Will Smith and Martin Lawrence can't save.",3,14 August 2021,"Miami police detectives and Lifelong friends frustrated family man Marcus Burnett(Martin Lawrence) and care free swaggering bachelor Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) return to takedown a drug network flooding Miami with ecstasy supplied by drug lord Johnny Tapia (Jordi Mollà). In addition to taking down the criminal network, the duo must also work around a DEA operation after the same objective headed by Marcus' sister, Syd (Gabrielle Union) with whom Mike has a relationship.Released in 1995, Bad Boys became a sleeper hit with audiences and transitioning Will Smith and Martin Lawrence from TV to film stardom. It also served as the launch pad for director Michael Bay who brought the same style to filmmaking he had to commercials and music videos (for better or worse). Given the time the film was made it makes sense why Smith and Lawrence would be eager to return to the roles that gave them their first success as both Smith and Lawrence were in what could charitably be described as lulls in their careers with Smith suffering three back to back bombs with Wild Wild West, Legend of Bagger Vance, and Ali, and while Lawrence had seen some success in the likes of Martin Lawrence Live: Runteldat and Big Momma's House, he too was becoming a less safe bet thanks to failures such as Black Knight and What's the Worst that Could Happen?. Bad Boys II became a success becoming the 10th highest grossing film of 2003 at $270 million which was seen as an unremarkable but acceptable success in relation to its $130 million budget. While I'm happy the film served it's purpose in reasserting the bankability of its lead stars, the movie itself is a bloated mess of explosions, car crashes, stupidity, and cruelty that kills any goodwill the movie might've had as a turn off your brain roller coaster ride instead resulting in a punishing gauntlet.Unlike the first movie's loose structure that allowed for some good improv between our two leads, Bad Boys II is stuffed to the gills with sub plots, side plots, supporting characters, side characters, competing agendas, and all this bloat that it feels less like a starring vehicle for Lawrence and Smith and more like a starring vehicle for director Michael Bay himself as he show's how much he's regressed as a filmmaker especially in his application of Shakycam which he's added to his repertoire in addition to his quick cuts, flashcuts, pan shots, and boarder line gynecological shots of women, that gives you a newfound appreciation for Bay's early film's like Bad Boys and The Rock and how objectively better staged those films were when it came to handling action. Some scenes of the film are nigh unwatchable with a sequence set in a Miami nightclub filled with flashing lights on top of flash cuts and panning shots taken from an ""upskirt"" angle that I felt myself getting vertigo from how disorienting everything was. And while the action is plentiful, two things work against it: 1) Bay's overuse of directorial flourishes such as shaky cam, flash cuts, etc. That destroy all sense of flow, progress, and spatial geography, and 2) every action scene is protracted in length well past the point of tolerance with a punishingly overdone freeway chase going on just short of forever.The movie clocks in at about 2 and ½ hours and it feels its length and then some. Plot and character are not this movie's focus and rightly so because it's less ""character"" and more ""caricature"" this time around. Marcus and Mike weren't the most developed characters in the first film, but they did have this charm that came from the comic friction in their odd couple dynamic. Marcus and Mike in Bad Boys II have lost any sense of humanity they had as characters instead replaced in ridiculous comic set pieces involving an electronics store that leads to a gay panic misunderstanding, a subplot about Marcus's inability to get an erection, and a rather tasteless scene where Marcus and Mike brandish a gun and make references to prison rape to a 15 year old boy who's the date of Marcus' daughter. I absolutely loathed these two in the movie, which is quite an accomplishment as Smith and Lawrence are likable leads so they had to ""try"" and fail to this point. The movie squanders a talented supporting cast in thankless positions with Gabrielle Union's Syd character basically added as kidnapping fodder for the final act and Jordi Mollà's Johnny Tapia basically a low rent scenery chewing version of Scarface. The plot is paper thin and only extended by the constant barrage of action scenes and juvenile humor that culminates in a bafflingly jingoistic climax where Mike and Marcus lead an unsanctioned military action in Cuba (clear pandering to the war hawks of the time).I'm not going to mince words, I HATED Bad Boys II. It's a poorly made, loud, idiotic, hateful mess of a movie that squanders its generous budget and solid leads on rehashed buddy cop cliches and pandering nonsense that would at best appeal to boys between the ages of 10 and 14. At least when this type of movie was made in the 80s it was winkingly ridiculous and kept the runtime to 100 minutes or less.",Bad Boys II
68,vithiet,More is not always better,5,18 April 2020,Michael Bay took everything from Bad Boys 1 and cranked it up to 11. Someone should have told him it doesn't meant it's going to make it better... or even good for that matter. It's ironic that with so much going on the whole time it tends to get boring.

70,hnt_dnl,"Why oh why oh why?! Well, money of course!",1,4 July 2011,"Right off the bat, I LOVED the first Bad Boys movie from 1995. It is still to this day one of my favorite buddy cop movies. It was so spontaneously quick-witted, fresh, funny, stylish, and cool! It is and will most probably the only Michael Bay movie that I will ever say that I actually liked! Now, in comes BAD BOYS II (2003), a full EIGHT years later, and, surprise, it, like most sequels...SUCKS! The main problem I had has already been stated. This sequel came out 8 years after the first one, which is way too long. If anything, a sequel should have been 2 to 3 years after the first one. One of the big reasons I realize now why the first Bad Boys worked so well was because, in terms of film experience, back in 95, both stars Martin Lawrence and Will Smith were movie novices and their comedy was fresh to the general movie-going world, Smith had still not attained superstar status (not even star status!), and Bay himself was new to the game, so they were all probably more willing to take advice and direction from more experienced hands as to what makes a movie work! But by 2003, Smith was a huge star and focusing on more dramatic roles, Bay had pretty much sold out that he was going to make nothing but loud, empty, emotionless action flicks (having done Armageddon and Pearl Harbor by this point), and Lawrence was doing whatever he was doing! Basically, this sequel was just a way for them to increase their financial profile, nothing else! Except for the fact that these 3 are involved, this sequel reminds me nothing of the first movie. Gone is the fresh and convincing, and charming buddy chemistry and natural dialogue between Smith and Lawrence from the first film; it's been replaced with stupid one-liners and disgusting jokes meant to elicit cheap laughs from the audience.Another noticeable negative of this movie is why is Gabrielle Union even in it? First off, it strains credibility that she and Lawrence are supposed to be siblings. Also, I thought is was so contrived that Marcus' sister just HAPPENS to be a DEA agent working on the same case as Marcus and Mike. It's like soap opera plot points for cripe's sake! Plus, I saw no chemistry between Union and Smith. I much preferred the simmering, building sexual tension between Smith and Tea Leoni (who was surprisingly engaging and a perfect fit as the female protagonist) from the first movie. I would have rather seen Leoni back as Mike's girlfriend, or dare I say it, wife! But, I guess even in the TWENTY-FIRST century, it's still unacceptable to have an interracial couple at the forefront of a film, unless it's some indie, Oscar-begging crap! Then they inexplicably replaced the the 2 supporting cop foils from the first movie (Sanchez and Ruiz, who were well-performed by those actors) with 2 noticeably younger, more obnoxious, and less funny pranksters in this one, which I guess was supposed to be meant as some kind of parody of the first 2 guys...it didn't work! The big drug dealer in this movie is literally a comical cliché of Bad Action Movie 101: overly abusive and always cursing at his lackeys, then turns into a sweetie with his kids and has some kind of phobia (he's afraid of rodents!). Not to mention that Bay plays up his nationality (Cuban) making him into a Castro-wannabe. The main bad guy from the first movie was legitimately scary and worldly and worthy of being an action-movie villain; I mean, the bad guy from the first movie really involved the viewer in the story as much as the heroes, but not this one.And, finally, the action...there's too much of it! I know it's an ACTION movie, but c'mon! Even in an action movie, it has to have other things going for it to work. Yeah, of course with Smith and Lawrence, there is comedy, but the comedy was used here almost separate from the action and plot, just to elicit laughs in between the action. All the comedy in the first movie literally flowed along with it and was A PART OF the action.Michael Bay is well on his way to being one of the worst ""film"" makers of all time, but at least Bay can hang his hat on the first Bad Boys movie, which is good. But definitely NOT this sequel!",Bad Boys II
71,vip_ebriega,"""Oh hell no!""",3,19 April 2010,"Michael Bay can blow almost anything up and still make it look good on camera, and this he insists for almost 3 hours in BAD BOYS II. I've purposely avoided this overstuffed, overlong sequel to Bay's first film BAD BOYS. I don't hate Michael Bay nor his approach of mindless and over-amped blockbusters, but I wouldn't want to waste my time on the 2 and a half hours of empty-headed drivel that BAD BOYS II had to offer. But when it was on TV, and with time to spare, I thought it couldn't be all that bad. I mean, I'm probably one of the few people who like a Bay's Armageddon or PEARL HARBOR.And yet, despite a few enjoyable moments, it really was THAT bad. The action is brisk and exciting at first, but then it goes on and on and on until Bay has nothing more to blow up. The filler of a story (I tried my best not to refer to it as a ""plot"") concerns our Narcotic agent heroes Marcus (Will Smith) and Mike (Martin Lawrence) going after a drug kingpin (Jordi Molla). But it's really just an empty barrage of action scene after action scene, each one bigger than the last. Worse, Bay can't help thinking of himself as an auteur by shooting the action sequences in either slow-mo (a trick he over uses here) or with fast cuts that make it almost impossible to know what's happening.BAD BOYS II is so loud and obnoxious that Bay couldn't even keep it down a notch during the ""talking"" scenes (in Bay's world, everyone talks trash). Plus the idea of humor in the movie is beyond tasteless. Smith and Lawrence's banter are occasionally amusing, but a chase sequence where Smith and Lawrence run over a couple of corpses dropping from a truck or a scene where they see two rats having sex in a graphic manner are just too much (and painfully, there are more). I find no problem with a big, loud, and dumb blockbuster, but BAD BOYS II insists that it can bigger, louder, and dumber than usual. It represents the most aimless attempt any blockbuster could commit: aim low and miss desperately. This is Bay's worst movie until his recent TRANSFORMERS sequel.Rating: *1/2 out of 5.",Bad Boys II
72,Stampsfightclub,Atrocious sequel that overblows the action and comedy,2,24 November 2009,"Mike Lowry (Smith) and Marcus Bennett (Lawrence) attempt to stop a drug baron exporting ecstasy across America.1995 and Michael Bay shoots a successful Bad Boys, a gun ho thriller that exploded The Fresh Prince onto the film stage and started a trend of Michael Bay action.Bay has had criticism over the years for his over the top immature approach to story telling and action and based on this film, those echoes are fully justified.There was a reason Bad Boys did well and it really had little to do with the director. Lawrence was on top comedy form and Smith the fresh smiley face was in full swing of refreshment. Having two young comedians tackle two heavily sought after roles was a shift into the unfamiliar for a buddy cop movie, and it worked a treat as the pair bounced verbally and toughly off each other.So where did it all go wrong in 2003? As we see the pair emerge undercover at some unexplained religious celebration there is racist banter, an over the top and unrealistic eventual shoot out and some gross out jokes that fill your mouth with bitterness.Yes, when the pair emerges there is a cool low angled slow mo shot but Mr Bay never seems to stop pumping this motion. In the abandoned house, as Smith emerges in a purple blazer, as a mine flies in the air etc. It's not The Matrix as much as he thinks.Perhaps the director isn't to be blamed for this film's overblown portrayal of testosterone. Ultimately this crime comedy boils down to one of the most poorly pencilled scripts in all of crime films.Seriously, what is the purpose of trying to justify comedy in the way of drugs, car chases and rivalry? Those elements are enough for the usual good cop film, leave out the comedy. The opening title sequence is reasonably well established as the plane once more glides over the Miami sign and the set up for the boat drop could have been worse but the descent into the ordinary exaggeration of detective work is ridiculous. Clues seem to be too easy to find, whenever there seems to be too much talking there is an inclusion of overly long action to compensate and in case something was missing, there are ridiculous stereotypes thrown in.These inclusions of rough gangsters doing drugs and a soft looking ruler just add to the sheer egregiousness of the overall picture. These included presumably getting some laughs but I struggle to see the humorous factor of Martin Lawrence on x, rat sex and a swimming pool breaking.Perhaps the fact Smith and Lawrence are comic geniuses makes this disappointing as they are not funny exempt for brief one-liners.Bay, the destroyer, has overblown the proportion of action with so many inclusions of bullets it is unforgivable not to mention numerous car chases that never result in a realistic crash. The franchise sadly looks to resume in 2012 but it surely won't get worse.",Bad Boys II
73,ivo-cobra8,"Excellent sequel, buddy cop gunplay action flick - favorite of mine I love it to death!",8,18 October 2016,"This is my all time favorite excellent sequel buddy cop gunplay action flick I love it to death. It is Michael Bay's underrated excellent sequel! This is a prototypical ""good"" action movie -- intense, perfectly executed, it is original action, shown to the tune of a unforgettable following story from the first movie with a gunplay's fanatic dreams. The score to this movie I would give (for you) for Bad-Boys II a 6.6. To action junkies, this movie is an easy 9, because the only thing that really matters is that the action is superb and the other elements, if not stellar, don't detract enough from the action to really make a difference.Splitting the difference, I am giving an 8/10 -- a good score.Bad Boys II (2003) is Michael Bay second installment in the Bad Boys franchise that first movie from the 90's become a classic buddy cop action flick. I went to see this movie in the movie theater in 2003 when it come out. I loved the first movie so much, that I hoped so much that there would be a sequel to this awesome movie flick and 8 years later my hopes were answered. I got this movie on Blu-ray and re watching this movie again I still absolutely love it, since the first time I watched it in the movie theater. There is action violence, some drug content, and some tiny bit of sexuality but still this movie got 8 awards and was the best action movie in 2003. This is one of Michael Bay's best action films. So in conclusion if anybody like teenagers, or adults want to see this movie then I think this a great movie for them if their interested in action movie. Plot: Narcotics cops Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) head up a task force investigating the flow of ecstasy into Miami. Their search leads to a dangerous kingpin Johnny Tapia (Jordi Mollà), whose plan to control the city's drug traffic has touched off an underground war. Meanwhile, things get sexy between Mike and Syd (Gabrielle Union), Marcus's sister.Michael Bay returns as director and the film finds Miami detectives Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) battling Haitian and Cuban drug runners. The film's cast includes Joe Pantoliano and Gabrielle Union. It may have taken 8 years to reunite the Bad Boys, but it was well worth it as Martin Lawrence and Will Smith go balls to the walls in this roller coaster ride of a sequel. Director Michael Bay leaves nothing unearthed as the bullets fly and bodies fall. The chase sequence on the Miami bridge is worth the price of admission alone.Gabrielle Union as Special DEA Agent Sydney ""Syd"" Burnett, did a wonderful, brilliant and outstanding job portraying Marcus sister. I am happy that we see Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) in relationship with Syd and that we meet Marcus (Martin Lawrence) sister for the first time. She was never mentioned before in the first movie and we never know about his family. Mike Lorey was an only child and his parents were rich. Watch out for the scene where Marcus accidentally drinks two pills of ecstasy and get's high in Captain Howard (Joe Pantoliano)'s house and does a funny scenes, it is hilarious. The sequel is one of the most technically perfect action movies of all time. The set-pieces are jaw dropping and the freeway chase is one of greatest car chases in cinema history. Real stunts, real explosions and arguably the most over the top casual brutality in a mainstream action movie. Bodies flying out of trucks, then being decapitated, it's all right here.There are the wildest car chase scenes put all over the film, there isn't only one scene there are more car scenes. There are cars crashes, explosions and destroyed motor vehicles, you see them a lot in a perfect stunt vehicle. There is a rescue mission when Marcus's sister (Gabrielle Union) is kidnapped Mike (Will Smith) and Marcus (Martin Lawrence), along with their voluntary S.W.A.T. team and Syd's DEA co-workers, prepare a military assault to rescue Syd from Tapia's home.There are a lot of handguns and automatic weapons used in this movie and they are used well, we see a lot of shootouts, watch out for slo- motion on the end of scene where Syd throws Lowrey's other Glock 17, yet Burnett appears with a Glock, he makes a flip from the mine filed, the mine is a decoy and shoots Tapia right in the head between the eyes, the ending is very climatic action perfectly executed on a mine field. The problem: movie is way too long but the action is so spectacular and pace so relentless that you'll be caught up until the end credits. The movie is about 30 minutes too long, clocking in at a whopping 2 and a half hours which is definitely overkill. You'll never be bored though as it rockets along at a great pace. I love Bad Boys I and II to death! Technically speaking, the movie is not perfect. I would give it a 9. As it stands, I give it: 8/10.Bad Boys II is a 2003 American buddy cop action comedy film directed by Michael Bay, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, and starring Martin Lawrence and Will Smith.

74,fernandoschiavi,"Filled with dubious and forced jokes and an inconsistent script, it's worth it just for the great action scenes",6,22 August 2020,"With the release of the first Bad Boys came recognition to director Michael Bay, who was called to command several other blockbusters of huge success in the sequence, such as A Rocha (1996), Armageddon (1998) and Pearl Harbor (2001). By this time, Bay had already achieved an enviable status in Hollywood, as well as Will Smith, who had also established himself as one of the greatest stars of cinema when he starred in Independence Day (1996), MIB: Men in Black (1997), Enemy do Estado (1998) and Ali (2001), for which he came to compete for the Oscar for best actor. With the success of the first film, Sony decided 8 years later to produce a sequel for Bad Boys and the main cast agreed to return.In this sequence, Narcotics detectives Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) were assigned to investigate the proliferation of ecstasy in the city of Miami. The investigations lead them to a bigger target, Johnny Tapia (Jordi Mollà), a drug dealer whose ambition to take care of the traffic in the city starts a real war between gangs. But the friendship and the professional relationship between Mike and Marcus are shaken when Mike starts to like Syd (Gabrielle Union), Marcus's sister. Unless they manage to separate their personal and professional lives, the duo is in danger and risks Syd's life in the process.Watching Bad Boys II, right after the original, is a minimally interesting work of perception for those who like to see political events materialize as a direct influence on cinema. At first glance, it is easy to say that the second film in the franchise is a continuation of everything that was already in the previous one, only elevated to a tenth power of chaos by Michael Bay. Bad Boys II reached the screens surpassing its predecessor in collection and exaggerating all the concepts created for the original. Incidentally, I also exaggerate the budget, which went from 23 million dollars in the first to an impressive 130 million, apart from advertising. Only the star fee in the new adventure is equivalent to twice the total cost of the 95 film. So much money allowed the producers extravagances, such as the acquisition of a 5,000 square meter mansion just to blow it up, to close one of the main access roads to Miami for three days for a chase scene and turn at least a hundred vehicles into scrap. In the bridge scene, 15 cars are hurled from a heroes' blanket, while dozens of others suffer collisions. The result pays off. The sequence is as good as the highway scene in Matrix Reloaded.If in the first film there is still all that 90's buddy cop logic that works as an end in itself, here it appears more as a device for a great propaganda of a vigilant, patriotic, moralistic state and with a strong xenophobic spirit. Not only that, but The Bad Boys II seems to be an accurate amalgamation of everything that is better and worse in the United States of the early 2000s. It is curious to note that even the comic logic of the film seems to convey this whole notion of the State of neurotic surveillance for the microcosm of your jokes. In one scene, Mike and Marcus are having an ambiguous sexual conversation inside an electronics store, until, unintentionally, a camera transmits that intimate situation to all the televisions on the store shelves, causing everyone to watch that embarrassedly. situation. There is no way to hide from Big Brother. Likewise, in the hilarious scene where the two detectives are going to scare Reggie, who is going out with Marcus's daughter, all the humor in the scene goes through the question of the father being extremely vigilant and the restriction of the girl's sexual freedom.The script of Os Bad Boys II explores the subject to the maximum to bring about a need for constant self-assertion by its protagonists, who, in the end, end up representing a wounded American ego after the attack. This is something that begins with the shot in the buttocks of Marcus, is perpetuated by the hints that the protagonists are a couple, by the vigilance in the daughter and by the erection problems of one of them. For this reason, the film ends up functioning as a kind of eternal trial of a certificate of hormonal production in American culture. In the middle of all this, there is the addition of Marcus's sister Syd, who has a secret affair with Mike, and also a transfer request from Burnett. The simplicity of the previous text comes out of a script that joins dozens of plots and does not develop a single one, in the absence of a cohesive or pretentious story, Bad Boys II appeals to all sorts of dilemmas, generic situations and totally gratuitous violence.The script doesn't even pay attention to its own scenes: at one point, to mention another example, the police chief played by Joe Pantoliano says that, fortunately, 'no policeman' had died in a chase that had just happened - at least a vehicle can be seen exploding during the sequence! To make matters worse, the screenwriters are still trying to include a low-key, out-of-the-way political message by citing that the story's villain, a Cuban, ""supports the Castro regime."" Besides, it is worth saying that the villain has a small daughter, whom he loves madly. However, if you think that the child was included in the plot to give the bandit a dramatic dimension, forget it: oddly enough, he only appears so that the film can make fun of his overweight.As if that were not enough, within this logic of trivializing sex and corpses, Michael Bay's intention is precisely to glorify violence in a frightening way, director Michael Bay practically forces the viewer to admire the aesthetic beauty of a shot in which we see, in slow motion, a bullet goes through one person's arm and then pierces another's neck. Bay and producer Jerry Bruckheimer take away any sacredness that the human body may still have in the universe it created. When the director places dismembered bodies at a meeting of mobsters, and reaches the height of the politically incorrect in a visual gag exploring even necrophilia, in fact, he is preparing us just for the entire third act in Cuba, in which bodies will be reduced to mere details within a show of special effects, explosions and slaughter. However, this is still a condemnable choice from the moral point of view, since, in proposing the desecration of bodies, it becomes much more assailable and acceptable in the viewer's subconscious, when the villains of the film: Haitians, Cubans and Russians; they are completely decimated by Bay's bullets and explosions. It would be comical if it weren't tragic, but the situation comes to a head when Marcus and Mike, fleeing by car, destroy an entire favela while having fun.And if in the original film the explosive relationship between the two heroes gave a certain charm to the production, this time they seem to fight only for the purpose of looking funny - but instead, they become just boring (the only member of the cast who can be consistently fun is Joe Pantoliano). However, Mike and Marcus don't just fail as comedians: as policemen, they are also a total disaster, kidnapping inmates and installing illegal wiretaps. In other words: even if they manage to collect incriminating evidence against the villain, it will be useless, since they will not be accepted in court. Furthermore, by the moral standards of Michael Bay and his friends, this behavior of the heroes should be greeted with enthusiasm - after all, were they not able to judge that a scene involving corpses being beheaded in traffic could be funny? In addition to the raped corpses, people blown to pieces, the politically incorrect rules in disturbing sequences, such as when Mike points a gun at a 15-year-old boy who just wanted to take his partner's daughter to the cinema, at a time when Marcus is going through a period of intense emotional imbalance.However, Michael Bay demonstrates once again that he has a strong aesthetic sense: his frames are elegant and Amir Mokri's photography is beautiful. Unfortunately, the filmmaker also proves he is unable to tell a story or develop his characters - and his insistence on frighteningly quick cuts only makes things worse (no wonder, this time, he worked with no less than three editors). In less than ten minutes, racial issues, drug problems and generic action scenes are covered, with the right to shoot bullets in slow motion with comic consequences. Other than that, there are still acid trips shown literally, in nightclubs with a lot of neon, contemplating the images with camera movements that come from the feet to the characters' heads, in a clear demonstration by the filmmaker that he knows how to film in this way. On the other hand, the action sequences are, for the most part, intense and full of energy: the car crashes are spectacular, the explosions are great. The movement of the camera, in some sequences, makes use of the same resources used in Matrix Reloaded, in which the walk of the camera through the scene is done on the computer, generating angles that would be impossible to be captured by real equipment.Bad Boys II becomes a fundamental sample of American cinema after 9/11. It is a perfect portrait of a local culture within its time. It all comes down to great self-assertion exhibitionism. In this sense, all the exaggeration already known to Michael Bay ends up perfectly matching the megalomaniacal proposal of this work, but the feeling we have is that the two-and-a-half-hour film should be at least half an hour less. Filled with dubious and forced jokes and an inconsistent script, it's worth it just for the great action scenes.",Bad Boys II

77,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Disgraceful,1,3 September 2005,"A huge budget sequel to the dumb ""Bad Boys."" I guess it was inevitable.I saw the HBO special on this movie and watch how Will Smith, Michael Bay, and Jerry Bruckheimer went on and on about how great this movie is. What was really happening was that Michael Bay and Will Smith were happy that they received a fat paycheck and Bruckheimer was happy that he will make another huge pile of money with the release.They said ""we finally got it perfect."" Perfect? Perfectly over-blown trash maybe. There is not the slightest distant glimmer of anything that faintly resembles originality here. It is all one boring dull mindless cliché after another until the viewer is literally ready to puke.The ""story"" starts with Will Smith, who is hot for Gabrielle Union who is Martin Lawrence's sister which is a a cheesy love vs family problem that is addressed so poorly that it shouldn't be there. And guess what? There is a twist! Gabrielle Union is an undercover cop working on what maybe the same case! Oh dear! We are also treated to a big loud car chase in which well over thirty vehicles are totaled along with the bad guys. But the good guys? They don't even get hurt. Some cops manage to land in critical care, but after flipping over in a car going 80 mph straight into a massive fireball in the middle of the highway you'd be dead. Yes the T-1000 survived such a feat, but he is a futuristic robot.Moving right on from the pathetic story and horrible action is the humor. It is also dumb, cliché, and overly vulgar. I mean are rat sex and junior high school level gay jokes something you'd expect to see in a movie not by John Waters? Types of humor have their placement in film, or as Michael Bay demonstrates so well, misplacement. Moving on we come to a sick excuse for a plot device. Towards the end our heroes got save Gabrielle Union who was kidnapped. They pack their service pistols and prepare to go to take on an entire drug cartel. But guess what? The police chief's friends are in the CIA and they decide, out of the goodness of their heart, to help two hotshot loose cannon detectives! So now, with the help of a bunch of CIA commandos half of Cuba is blown up and everyone goes home safe. Preposterous on all counts.There are entertaining movies that follow this kind of preposterous formula. James Bond, for one. He is just as ridiculous as this movie, but he has a light side. He doesn't take himself too seriously. Those films have a tongue in cheek nature that constantly reminds us that we are watching what is basically a fairy tale. Not here. This film takes it self so seriously and tries to be ultra cool and slick. Thankfully it fails on all fronts of film making. Let's hope we don't see anything like it anytime soon.Sick, disgusting, unoriginal, a horrible waste of money, superficial, unentertaining, unfunny, vulgar, and just plain terrible.

I thought the film would not be good at all, but it was. there are some things I have against that film. one is that there is tooooooo much swearing. i counted almost 400 curses in that film! 250 of those curses are from the two stars Will and Martin. Another thing is some of the graphic violence, I mean, one guy gets shot through the head and his body lands on land mines, shredding his body to pieces, and another part, a man getting cut into pieces from saws. A bit nasty.

Michael Bay delivers incredible hardcore action and it's fun to watch, but over the course of the film it grows tiresome and numbing.

The film features actors Martin Lawrence and Will Smith. This is the sequel to the 1995 film of international repercussion The Bad Boys.SynopsisNarcotics detectives Mike Lowrey (Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) were chosen for a high-tech task in investigating ecstasy trafficking in Miami. The inquiries inadvertently lead them to a larger conspiracy with a self-appointed drug dealer Johnny Tapia (Jordi Mollà) whose ambitions to take over the city will start a gang war.
But the friendship and professional relationship between Mike and Marcus is shaken when Mike begins to like Syd (Gabrielle Union), Marcus's sister. Unless they can separate personal and professional life, the pair is in danger and risks Syd's life in the process.
Bad Boys sequel script is more stocky and now has to deal with professional and personal life! With this theme the second Bad Boys movie independently knew the story is good, without many clichés ... Focusing not only on the action, but on the comedy that was one of the highlights of the movie, and the coexistence of two partners who love each other and hate each other at the same time funnier too and more genius action scenes.

No it doesn't.Since we all know what the movie about (always about drugs) and who is in it, I'll cut to the chase what Bad Boys II actually offer the viewer: Bad Boys II doesn't have much of the story into it. It is like 80% action and 20% substance. And 80% in two and the half hour  trust me, that was way too much. It even bored me at time. With never ending cars chase, and fighting, and when you thought it is finish it goes on and on and on differences places just like Speed 1 and 2.Don't get me wrong, Bad Boys II is an action pack film and I do enjoy watching it.

84,johnnymonsarrat,Jon Monsarrat review: not as good as promos,6,12 May 2004,"I love action movies, so having seen the Bad Boys trailer, I was really looking forward to it. Plenty of stuff blows up in the film, and the car chase scene was perhaps the best I've ever seen. Wow! Lots of cars tumbling. And I was particularly impressed by Joe Pantaliano, who transforms the everyday angry police chief into something more interesting.Unfortunately, all the jokes fall flat. Martin Lawrence comes across as annoying, Will Smith steals all the scenes (don't both cops get to do something useful?), and there's some silly ""joke"" violence regarding death that didn't work for me. They even reuse the pool joke twice. Characters do things in the film that don't quite make sense. The subplot with the Russian character is wasted. Will Smith is too cool so he doesn't get ""unsettled and bothered"" the way a straight man is supposed to. And they don't use the party music during the action scenes like in the promo; they use it during the quiet scenes. Who made that decision?Who should see this film:-- Action junkies, but only on a rainy day-- Angry police chiefs who instead of yanking the badges from the renegade officers who have crossed the line, offer full support.-- Nobody else, even if you think you might want toSo... action varies greatly from OK to great, but plot and everything else either bad or nothing special.

The comedic pairing of Smith and Lawrence is even better here because of the time that's past to make their relationship feel more authentic. Unfortunately, the film's runtime is also increased by nearly 30 minutes from the previous film and its mostly unnecessary filler moments that feel like they don't have much bearing on the actual plot.

Although it suffers from the same defaults that the first movie had: not interesting villains, basic plot and overused explosions. At least the two main characters are good or else the whole movie would have been a flop. Mike lowrey (Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) are the exact opposites of each other: Mike is the more sexy and cool type of cop while Marcus is a family man, nerdy and scared. Mike and Marcus have proven us once again that they have nothing in common and argue over everything. But they manage to get along, work together, kick ass and save the day. So they are a dynamic duo at the end of the day. Never really loved Michael Bay's films with overused explosions and green screen but this film does an improvement in action and plot. Just wished they would have focused better on the story.",Bad Boys II

a gazillion times I was excited to see how 'Bad Boys II' would look on 4K Blu-ray.
Sumptuous! But we'll get
on to the technical aspects later.Bad Boys II sees Will Smith and Martin Lawrence return in an action packed comedy thrill ride.
Directed once again by Michael Bay.
This time the two Miami narcotics cops are on the tail of a Cuban drug cartel led by Kingpin Johnny Tapia played by Jordi Molla.
From start to finish this movie is an absolute blast.
Packed full of gunfights, car chases, explosions and side splitting comedy.
Michael Bay surely knows how to direct action.
Often not given the credit he deserves. He can thank the countless crap 'Transformers' sequels for that.
However this film is masterfully helmed.
There's some sublime moviemaking here.
A particular gunfight in a drug dealers house springs to mind.
The camera constantly swooping around the green painted room as it transfers through walls and broken windows allowing the audience to see the action from the perspective of all carrying a gun.
There's so many breathtaking moments
A car chase involving a Ferrari and a boat is jaw dropping. I could go on.
There's countless big screen big budget moments that will leave the audience gasping.
When the action does dissipate the onscreen chemistry between Smith and Lawrence is joyful.
Their comedic timing and ability to bounce off one another propels this film onto another level.
A certain scene in a Audio Visual store is hilarious.Speaking of Audio Visuals this film is a Home Cinema nerds dream.
As I aforementioned on 4K Blu-ray this film looks sumptuous. Like all Michael Bay movies colours are rich and over saturated. Blacks are inky and the implementation of HDR make specular highlights blinding.
Shot on 35mm we can expect a level of grain and here lays the only negative.
I certainly don't have a problem with grain. In fact I believe it can enhance the cinematic experience.
But on this marvellous transfer the grain fluctuates in severity.
It's never off putting but one moment the image is 4K crisp the next it's just above standard DVD quality.
Some scenes are reference quality but overall this 4K transfer falls short.
HDR sometimes aggravates flaws in the image as well as elevating some wonderful shots.
I'm nitpicking. This is a film made better by 4K HDR. It's just a little inconsistent.If the picture is great. The audio is equally stunning.
Again it's not reference.
Those reviewers who say it is are being a tad too generous.
The Dolby Atmos mix is a welcome upgrade.
I'm only used to hearing this movie in 5.1.
Whilst there's nothing that jumps out of the height channels the object based audio is subtly immersive.
What am I saying? There's nothing subtle about this mix. Bass gets deep down and dirty. Explosions shake the living room. Gunfire has that delicious thud you can feel in the chest.
Surround effects are working seamlessly to envelop the listener into the world onscreen.
It's a great mix but more modern movie sound mixes have that extra layer. That little more extension in every department.
Still it's a great listen and worth purchasing on 4K for the Atmos track alone.Bad Boys II is superior over the already great original.
Both as a movie and as a audio visual experience.
I can't wait for the long overdue third instalment.",Bad Boys II
94,diac228,"boom, boom, crash, BOOOM, SMASH, crash, ouch, BOOOOOOOOOOOOM. That's the movie in a nutshell.",7,27 May 2009,"Michael Bay is an offspring of the 90s action craze, which delivered about a dozen or so decent-to-incredible rated-R movies that pulled no punches whatsoever. Bay himself was responsible for two of them: The Rock and Bad Boys. However, starting in 1998 he became a softie with the weak Armageddon and even weaker Pearl Harbor. After those two softies, he treads back into familiar territory by crafting a sequel to the film that put his name on the map. Combining the same elements that made the original watchable (and rated-R within the first few seconds) and then expanding upon them infinitely, Bad Boys II was prepared to rock your socks into the stratosphere.Bad Boys II does just that, deliver enough action to make you cheer, cringe, and cover your eyes even. There are head shots, butt shots, neck shots, shoulder shots, forehead shots and even eye shots. In this film we have at least 3 chases, at least 5 shootouts, and an on-screen death count that's among the highest you'll ever see in a measly buddy cop flick. Bad Boys had a slew of action within one city; the sequel's action spans different countries. Not bad for a couple of frustrated cops.In the second installment, the relationship between Mike and Marcus (Will Smith and Martin Lawrence) begins deteriorating as partners and friends while at the same time there's a major drug operation busting loose between dealers in Miami and dealers overseas. The writers the second time around didn't touch the script of the original, which explains the different sort of cinematic flavor here. Bad Boys was rough around the edges and gritty, yet realistic. Bad Boys II cranks it up a couple of notches and turns it into an explosion-fest that uses more pyrotechnics than a war film. The script also allowed for plenty of improvisation between the comedian Lawrence and the always-reliable Smith, and the payoff isn't as strong since most of the time was spent bickering. Two movies in, the bickering gets old.But you are not here for the character development (Don't worry, there is none). You are here to see fights, explosions, rage, carnage, and enough machoism to make the movie itself threaten you with a rusty utensil. Michael Bay absolutely loves blowing things up and making things crash until the set pieces become unrecognizable. Bad Boys II is an entire deck of cards in terms of action. Unfortunately, the better hands are dealt in the beginning, with the top action piece being the well-constructed chase in Miami involving plenty of cars. Bay's direction improves slightly over the two softies by delivering long shots of the action and some clever camera movement. Granted CGI is involved with the moving, but we won't complain as three cars launch themselves towards the screen.What prevents Bad Boys II from being a totally grand throwback to the late 80s-early 90s action phenomenon is the immense amount of violence the movie actually contains. Surely movies like Commando, Die Hard, and The Rock had their share of deaths, but the deaths were delivered with at least an ounce of respect. In this case, dead bodies were used as jokes, and a lot of times. We see little to no respect for the fallen, and it becomes a guilt trip getting through some of these scenes and not feel a little disgusted. This movie isn't for the weak, and even the manliest of men might feel impure seeing just how destructive the chaos is.Bottom Line: By the time the movie wraps up, there will be enough blowing up for the screen to increase in temperature. Bad Boys II is an admirable effort, but character chemistry and down-to-earth behavior is replaced with.explosions and.more explosions. Just like Transformers, the action is what keeps the movie afloat and bearable. There are indeed some amazing-looking scenes in Bad Boys II, but don't expect for the waters to run deeper than that.",Bad Boys II
95,johnnymacbest,A lesson Hollywood needs to learn.,3,22 June 2008,"A lesson Hollywood needs to learn.Bad Boys 2 is just another gangsta cop movie that ultimately pales in comparison to buddy cop movies in general.Why this sequel was made in the first place is beyond me. It seems that the producers and writers of this piece of s*** ran out of ideas in terms of storyline and dialog which is full of many flaws.First is the language. Why do black cops need to swear in this type of film? Was it really necessary for Will Smith and Martin Lawrence to blurt out nonsensical profanity when high quality films like Rush Hour and Hollywood Homicide rarely require it? To all you moviegoers of various races, shapes and sizes, the answer is NOOOOOOOO!!!! If the producers decide on making a third sequel to this drivel, they should instead make it into the form of an animated movie rather than a live-action film. As it turns out, many movie critics have already called this film a cartoon because, unfortunately, for this particular film, it's exactly what it is. It truly pays homage for all those cartoons featuring big-lipped, loud-mouthed po po's who talk jive and act completely stupid, while black children who wake up every Saturday morning to watch them on television. Truly, they are sending a bad message to black American children.To all things considered, BB2 boasts a number of exciting action scenes. As I recall from the first film, the action scenes were exceptional. In this second installment, they are far more bloody and gory, especially the bullet time sequences early in the film when a Klan member gets popped in the jugular with impressive results. But as we all know, special effects only go so far. The action scenes, while exciting and entertaining, are exaggerated, unrealistic and just downright plain ludicrous. Since when did police officers get into situations like these? Bad Boys 2 fails on many aspects. The dialog is unremarkable, the jokes are lame yet some of them are quite funny and may leave a chuckle or two, but in the end they quickly dry out. The jokes feature so many stringed together four-letter words within dialog that it's hard and confusing to understand the plot. The characters are all racial stereotypes of past buddy cop movies whether good or bad, especially Martin Lawrence and Will Smith. Joe Pantoliano is poorly cast as the no-nonsense police chief who spews forth cheesy expletives from his cocked mouth. In short, they're not even funny, but rather annoyance. It seems that the screenwriters thought that by making the actors spew foul language that this would make the film more entertaining to watch. It doesn't. The amount of adult language in this film has been greatly used to no certain extent to sugar coat the mediocre plot. Unfortunately, this ruins what might have been a worthy successor to the past hit of the mid-1990's. A fine example on how to make a blaxpoitation film for the new millennium.Simply put, the average moviegoer has no idea that this abomination of a movie was put together by a sinister organization of white filmmakers and producers dedicated to creating stereotypical movies featuring swearing Afro American po po's to be viewed by the world. Oh the horror, the horror, the horror, AAAAAAGH!!!! The only reason I'm giving BB2 a three is for the car chases and some action scenes. Other than that the film is a toss-up.",Bad Boys II

With Bad Boys II, Bay channeled all his rampant sexualization of women, his fetish for wanton destruction and carnage, and off-kilter humor into what was, for him, a smaller film than those he'd done to that point. Coming off a box-office hit (but critical turkey) with Pearl Harbor, after three consecutive action hits in Bad Boys, The Rock, and Armageddon, Bay's return to the Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowrey show felt a little like he'd come full circle - it was where his career began, and thus the sequel felt a little like a tip-of-the-hat to the fans, the audiences who'd made him a (relative) household name. Bad Boys II is a bigger, badder, meaner, slicker sequel in every way, the kind borne of character familiarity and perhaps a sense of pushing the envelope beyond breaking point; while Smith was churning out box-office gold with almost every film he appeared in, Lawrence's career to this point involved box-office poison like Blue Streak, Big Momma's House, and the precursor to stupid medieval spoof movies like Your Highness, in Black Knight, all of which were rightly condemned as utter waste. Lawrence needed a big hit to get back into Hollywood's good graces - and Bad Boys II was his meal-ticket. With Bay behind the camera, Will Smith once again charming the ladies and everyone else with his debonair swagger, and a budget set to cater for massive pyrotechnics and action sequences, would Bad Boys II recapture the glory of those halcyon days of the mid-90's, or would it be yet another drubbing by critics at the hands of a director known for his lack of subtlety and restraint?
Miami Police Officers Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) are working a case of high quality ecstasy coming into the city from Cuba. This clash leads then into jurisdictional conflict with the DEA, on their own case with Burnett's sister, Sydney (Gabrielle Union) working deep undercover as a money launderer. Syd's mission is unknown to Marcus, who is also unaware that Syd has embarked upon a romantic relationship with Mike. After initially butting heads, Marcus and Mike work with Syd, leading them to Florida drug kingpin Johnny Tapia (Jordi Molla), who has recently acquired all the nightclubs in Miami from owner Alexi (Peter Stormare). Johnny Tapia is using corpses stuffed with drugs, smuggled into the country from Cuba, where he has his base. While their captain, Howard (Joe Pantoliano) runs the risk of having a pressure-related stroke, Mike and Marcus must take the fight to a foreign land in order to rescue a kidnapped Syd and to stop the drugs from entering the United States.One of the things I used to love about Michael Bay movies, well before I got married, had kids, and re-prioritized my life, was his apparent glee at being paid to film women in skimpy clothing, strong-armed men getting about being all macho, and balls-out action sequences. Before he ever dabbled with Optimus Prime and Shia LaBeouf, Bay concocted a career carved from the chaos of confusion, a cacophony of incoherent clatter created with careful comedy and combustible carnage. Bad Boys' rough-edged aesthetic never really tipped Bay's hand at his full capabilities as a director, an orchestrator of the visual spectrum, until he had honed his craft through several successful film projects, the most monumental (and monumentally asinine) being Pearl Harbor, through which his excess and lack of restraint finally overtook his ability to generate excitement. Why have one explosion when you could have a dozen, right?Bad Boys II is an excessively loud, obnoxious, horrifying journey through Bay's misogynistic view of life through his sun-kissed camera lens. It's all huff and bluster, this film, a terribly convoluted plot framed through bikini models and gargantuan gunfire, violent and impactful in its offensiveness and over-eager depiction of women as objects of lust. Don't get me wrong, I love looking at attractive women and I have been known to enjoy the female form in its various states of undress through my life, but Bay's use of camerawork here, lusting on scantily clad buttocks, whipping his camera upskirt-style through a nightclub with no less than four female crotches coming into view, is just icky to the extreme. Gratuity is something we've now come to expect from Bay, and at the time I saw this originally, I think I was more titillated than turned-off by his fetish for near-nude women. A contributing factor in all this is the script's insistence in referring to almost all women as ""bitches"", as if that word in that context is somehow cool; the real low point, however, comes late in the film, when our two heroes infiltrate a morgue and spend about four minutes discussing the implications of having impure thoughts about a rather hot, busty female corpse.Even taking into account Bay's rampant hyper-sexualization of women, of which this film only has one of significant narrative value in Gabrielle Union's Sydney, Bad Boys II remains a nasty, shrill exercise in extracting minute amounts of ""comedy"" from the shouty, bangy, explodey extravagance on display. Neither Martin Lawrence, a man I find utterly unfunny, and the normally entertaining Will Smith, hit their straps here, with Smith coming in for an especially egregious ""phone it in"" performance that lacks bite or wit, or charm. And a charmless Will Smith makes for a hugely awkward ""comedy"" film. While Smith and Lawrence overact in almost every situation, and all but choke on the absolutely horrendous dialogue they're given (how much was actually scripted, and how much was riffed on the spot, I'm not sure), Bad Boys II has a smothering layer of gormless hatred filtering any goodness or enjoyment out of it. It's a hateful film, this one, a film wallowing in the abyss of self-destructive masculine alpha-ness, decidedly offensive to almost everyone, and amusing exactly nobody. Jordi Molla's cumbersome screen villain never really generates the fear and anxiety the script demands of him, while Joe Pantoliano is about the only truly amusing thing here, as the apoplectic Captain Howard - although he's as cliched a ""screaming police commander"" character as you'd ever want in a movie.
I
For a film running some 2 and a half hours, Bad Boys II takes its sweet time doing anything. The plot to thwart a major drug kingpin is punctuated by lengthy moments of action violence, all of which is filmed in Bay's usual slick style. As the bullets fly and the shrapnel explodes across the screen, Bay's camera captures some remarkable footage (probably heightened with visual effects), in particular a breathless car/truck/boat chase down a Miami freeway that simply defies the laws of physics. A tenement shootout between Marcus, Mike, and a bunch of Haitians, with Bay's camera whizzing around walls, through bullet holes, and creating a sense of hyperbolic frisson, is particularly stylish (it's a camera move he'd go on to use in future movies from time to time), while a duo of third-act sequences - a terrific mansion destruction sequence, and a frantic crash-n-bash drive through a hillside slum - bring the film to a headache-inducing close of screaming, explosions and a sweet minefield death that's almost worth the price of admission. Almost. While Bay generally nails the action, the underpinning story and character development is blase, undercooked, and typically over-masculine. Bay's idea of character development is two black men talking about sexual dysfunction and calling each other ""ma niggah"". If that floats your boat, by all means go watch this film.Bad Boys II is a screaming mess, a hodge-podge of action beats given slick screen treatment without having an ounce of subtlety or actual wit. Aside from one genuinely amusing scene - Marcus and Mike taunt and belittle a young lad who has come to take Marcus' daughter out on a date - the film sputters through its histrionic comedy, thanks to Will Smith's doing-this-for-a-paycheck performance, and Martin Lawrence's inane facial tics (seriously, it's almost like he has tourettes); you'd be hard pressed to enjoy much of this if it wasn't for Will Smith's built-in screen persona, and even then it's still a stretch. The action is frantic, the story hardly rises above generic, and the overall tone of the movie could be described as ""mean"". Yeah, I didn't really like it back in 2003, and frankly, not much has changed.",Bad Boys II

101,cosmic_quest,Popcorn Fun,7,12 March 2006,"Like it's prequel, 'Bad Boys II' is not the sort of film you should watch if you like deep-thinking, philosophical dramas. But if you're just wanting to be entertained by plenty of action, sarcastic jokes and wisecracks then this is a perfect blockbuster for you.It doesn't pretend to have some deep plot-- the storyline is the very simple premise of catching the drug dealers and getting the girl-- but it is pure popcorn entertainment complete with car chases and gun fights. The interplay between Will Smith and Matthew Lawrence is hilarious (the 'Bad Boy' films are the only time I can tolerate Lawrence); a more up-to-date version of Riggs and Murtaugh in the Eighties classic buddy flick 'Lethal Weapon'.Very enjoyable action comedy that should please most fans of Hollywood blockbusters and cop flicks.",Bad Boys II
102,ExpendableMan,"Over the top, trigger happy macho nonsense. I loved it!",8,21 March 2007,"It must be awesome being Michael Bay. I mean, can you imagine any other director who is given mega-budgets every few weeks and told to blow up more than he did in his previous movies? In the first Bad Boys film an air-plane hanger was blown to bits and was swiftly followed by an asteroid being nuked in Armageddon and the destruction of Pearl Harbour in...uh, Pearl Harbour. Not to be undone, Bad Boys 2 has him indulging in not one, but two chaotic car chases where muscle cars which most of us would spend our lives saving up for are torn to pieces like yesterday's newspapers and rounding everything up by detonating a sizable part of Cuba. If this trend continues, there won't be a building left standing in the whole of North America once Transformers is through. Not bad for a smug little geek with a rubbish haircut.If you've seen the first Bad Boys film, you'll know what to expect. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence return as Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett, a pair of loose cannon cops whose only similarities are their penchants for arguing and getting into gun fights. Lowrey (Smith) is all laid back cool, stylin' and profilin' his way through the Miami underworld while charming the pants off every woman that crosses his path. Burnett on the other hand is an insecure, neurotic and over protective family man. Not only that, but he has a bit of an anger management problem as well and has been half a step away from a severe nervous breakdown for the majority of his adult life. So far, so very similar to any cop orientated buddy movie you've ever seen, but Bad Boys 2 overcomes the total lack of originality thanks to the natural charisma of the stars and the sheer spectacle of its action sequences.The plot of course is throw away guff designed to hurtle Smith and Lawrence into the thick of as many explosions as possible, but when they bounce off each other this well it's difficult to care. Martin Lawrence has never been a great leading man but somehow, when partnered with Will Smith his career makes perfect sense, his manic edginess being the perfect foil to Smith's effortless charm. You could argue that being on screen with the World's Most Charismatic Man would make anyone look good, but then you'd clearly not have seen the terrible I, Robot, where nobody looked good. Not even the robot.And then you have the aforementioned action sequences. Yes, we all know they're going to be over the top, but lord almighty, it's still an adrenaline pumping thrill to see them happen. The opening John Woo impression with the Ku Klux Klan is just the starter to a main course that consists of a destruction derby car chase, a close quarters battle with some Rastafarian gang members, a fist fight on a train carriage, ANOTHER insane car chase and a dessert set in Cuba, where a mansion gets destroyed. Throughout, bodies fly off overpasses to go crashing into glass phone boxes, men are riddled with machine gun fire and the balls of fire get bigger and more firey the later they appear. Bad Boys 2 might not be subtle, but it sure as hell is fun.However, there is a drawback: the running time. It might be an energetic exercise in flashy excess, but did it really need to be two and a half hours long? Entertaining though it is, there comes a point when you've seen enough faceless henchmen getting holes drilled in them and just want to see the villain being brought down. Given the extreme running time, isn't also a bit unusual that Joe Pantoliano's role as the best clichéd police chief in movie history is so small? Maybe they were worried he'd pack the movie into his bags and run off with them like he did the first time around...Those grumbles aside, there's little complaint to be made about Bad Boys 2. Sure, it's so shallow that I could just as easily have written ""Will Smith and Martin Lawrence destroy stuff"" and summed up the entire enterprise, but it makes for an exhilarating action movie and the natural successor to all those ones produced in the eighties when brain cells were exchanged for body counts and biceps. Try not to take it seriously and you'll have a blast.",Bad Boys II
103,The_Wood,All Hail the King of the Summer Movies!!!,10,19 July 2003,"Violent, loud, relentless, and without question the coolest film of the summer.  Michael Bay's action epic is the action movie to top all action movies.  It's as if Bay and producer Bruckheimer are saying, ""we dare you to top this."" For Will Smith, the film is a breath of fresh air.  What Smith is doing with this picture, is showing that he can do something more than entertain the PG-13 crowd with his alien fighter shinanigians.  It's nice to see Will Smith play a pi**ed off angry cop, as opposed to his usual Mr. Nice Guy shtick.  Martin Lawerence shows that he does have talent, if he works with the right people.  My advice to Lawerence is don't make any movies except BAD BOY movies.Much has been said about the film's violence, and frankly I'm surprised by it.  Yes the film is violent.  There are a lot of people getting shot and killed.  What do you expect?  It's a cop movie.  Most critics have mentioned the scene involving dead bodies, used for comedic value.  This is the same type of humor you see in movies like Final Destination 2, where the laughs come from the deaths.  I don't find it offensive, because the scene with the bodies is an important slice to the narrative, and hey, it is FUNNY.As an action picture, no other film this summer comes close to Bad Boys 2. The Matrix Reloaded tops Bad Boys 2 as an overall movie, but if you are just to measure the action scenes, Bad Boys 2 wins.  Many have been comparing the chase scenes of this film and Reloaded.  Let me say this, the freeway chase scene in Reloaded beats the chase scene in this film.  The difference, the freeway scene in Reloaded was the main action scene, while the chase scene in Bad Boys 2 is one of seven amazing action scenes.  No other Hollywood movie can compare to the amount of action that is in this film.  So because, as of right now, Bad Boys 2 is the definitive action picture, you owe it to yourself to see it.",Bad Boys II

105,jpintar,Way too long,5,11 December 2003,"Whose idea was it for Bad Boys II to run nearly 2 1/2 hours long?  This story should be maybe 90-100 minutes long.  But 2 1/2 hours?  It has some exciting chase scenes and some nice humor, but its length takes it toll. Scenes labor on and on, such as the scene in the morgue and an unnecessary scene involving a teenage girl's first date.  This is worth a rental and that's it.",Bad Boys II

For example,  when the dog made the swimming pool break and Martin Lawrence fell in the lake was pointless. Theresa Randle just had a walk on role in the movie! Gabrielle Union made this movie good! If she wasn't in it,  I'm sure this movie would have definitely made the bottom 100 movie list!Will and Martin would have been fired from any police station for the shenanigans they pulled in this movie!

Mind-blowing action, non stop excitement and barrelled fuelled comedy are all present and correct in this blazing kick-ass action comedy served from Michael Bay (Transformers.) Bad Boys is from start to finish a rip-roaring, bone crunching, and ass-cracking thrill ride. Smith and Lawrence deliver their best performances yet in a film that will have you laughing right to the end. The story is simple. Its about two Narcotics cops who are made to bring down a Cuban drug Kingpin who is flowing large amounts of ecstasy into Miami. Things start to go weird as Lowrey (Smith and Burnett (Lawrence) realise that the kingpin starts to control not only the flow of ecstasy but also starts drug trafficking.This IS entertainment at its blistering best.",Bad Boys II

It was about 30 minutes too long I'm afraid though.  There were many times that I thought there were scenes that could have been cut and still made this movie funny and with great action.  Some of the parts were a little overacted as well.  All in all I thought this was a good film and I will watch it over and over again for a few scenes.  It does have some horrible language in this movie so do not let you kids see it unless you don't care if they repeat what they see.  Check the movie out if you are of age.  It's a good film.,Bad Boys II
112,loco_73,"""Bad Boys II"" - Racism, necrophilia, Michael Bay and Will Smith",1,24 August 2011,"I had the misfortune of seeing this movie a few weeks ago due to a bout of sleeplessness...it was late-night, uncut and uncensored at that! Even though it came out years ago...This was a vile, disgusting, racist piece of filth masquerading as a movie. It has been a while since I have seen such a demeaning, nauseating slice of feces! Where do you start...the rat sex...the mutilated bodies...not that's not it...maybe seeing Will Smith and Martin Lawrence calling a young man n **ger and f **got and proceeding to humiliate him in every which way in the name of comedy? Or watching Martin Lawrence and Will Smith going back and forth, in a morgue no less, about the hotness of the breasts of a dead young woman?!!? Yep folks this ""masterpiece"" has it all...even undertones of necrophilia...These are just a few examples of what is a long list of stomach churning and insulting scenes, which are passed on as comedic relief and edgy humour, instead of the blatant stupidity and lack of creativity which characterizes ""Bad Boys II"". I used to find Michael Bay to be an utterly talentless hack bent on spewing his PG-13 masturbatory fantasies upon the world, but after being unfortunate enough to see this dreg, he can also add to his putrefying resume the label of racist.As for Will Smith, I gave up on him and his ""Freshness"" many years ago. After what was a great performance in ""Ali"", it went all downhill from there...this ""gem"" of a movie, was his first role after his turn in ""Ali""...wow what a downgrade! Over the years his ego became as over-inflated as his hype and his pay-cheques, now he can add his annoying family to that! Martin Lawrence is not even worth discussing...a complete waste of space!

113,johnny-08,Brainless fun that hurts no one,6,28 October 2008,"Although ""Bad Boys 2"" is no where near type of movie that I prefer, it came in a perfect time (on TV, for about third time!!), after hard day, when you don't need another drama or a movie where you need to think about. ""BB 2"" offers plain and simple fun action movie that won't stick with you after you watch it cause it's not special or innovative in any way. We all know that computer these days can do everything so car chase or loads of bullets all over the place aren't something (all Michael Bay movies are same) which makes directing very easy. That's why I cannot judge or rate this movie along with 'real' movies. But it's good to see Will Smith & Martin Lawrence back, after 8 years, in roles of cops Lowrey & Burnett and what's also good is that they still make a great team. Comical parts are very good, plot is maybe too much but no one expected any brains in this movie. There isn't much to act from main duo and supporting actors Pantoliano & Stormare made their usual impact. Bay is one of directors I dislike after viewing crappy movies like ""Pearl Harbor"", ""Armageddon"" and ""Transformers"" (I'm not supporter of certain blockbusters) but I have no complaints about ""Bad Boys"". Bay just took all that money and made a movie that popcorn audience will enjoy.",Bad Boys II
114,ilovedolby,"It begs the question, in a movie, just because we can blow something up, does that mean that we necessarily should blow something up? A question that Bay and Bruckheimer really need to start asking themselve",1,31 July 2003,"Whenever producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay team up to make a movie, you can count on a few things-it's going to be big, loud, explosive and annoying as all hell. Their track record certainly supports that, after all, this is the team that brought us such films as `Armageddon,' and `Pearl Harbor.' It was especially funny to see Bay directing the latter two films considering they were marketed strongly towards teenage girls. When you consider that this man has only done hard-core action flicks prior to the two films listed above, it drove me to one conclusion; Bay is in fact a fourteen year old girl trapped in a grown man's body. Okay, all jokes aside, Bay has now brought us the unwanted and completely unnecessary sequel to the 1995 film, `Bad Boys II.' So where can this sequel go that no other action flick has done before-absolutely nowhere. It's obvious and obnoxious from start to finish. And the worst part about it all is that it is far too long for it's own good. 	We team up with Miami cops Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) eight years after their first big drug bust. This time, the two are after a Cuban named ""Johnny"" Tapia (Jordi Mollà) and his drug cartel that are responsible for supplying Miami with ecstasy. Beyond the aspects of their job, the two cops confront the notion that Lowrey has been seeing Burnett's sister Sydney (Gabrielle Union), who is also an undercover cop on the same case to crack the dealers. It becomes not only a mission to stop the drug dealers, but also a personal vendetta against Tapia when he kidnaps Sydney. 	If you have ever seen every other buddy cop movie in the history of buddy cop movies, then you have already seen `Bad Boys II.' But the film mostly resembles that of `Tango & Cash,' the 1989 flick that starred Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell. I won't deny that Smith and Lawrence is a good screen pair-they are fun to watch and provide a few good laughs. But for the majority of the film, they are just screaming the f-word back and forth while their guns are blazing. The effect looses its comic appeal after the first ten minutes, if it had any comic appeal to begin with.	Beyond the rehashed story, the film is completely outlandish. You can tell this when you see the poster and the first thing that comes to mind is `Black Hawk Down,' another Bruckheimer flick, but one that was actually quite good. But `Bad Boys II' treats Miami as if it were Mogadishu. Machine guns are constantly being fired, cars driving out of control, helicopters and speed boats trying to stop the flow of ecstasy into the city and a few KKK members just around the ride. It's as if the Miami police and the drug dealers have declared war on each other. The whole thing feels so stupid to watch, regardless of how well done the action scenes are. It begs the question, in a movie, just because we can blow something up, does that mean that we necessarily should blow something up? A question that Bay and Bruckheimer really need to start asking themselves. 	Enough said, `Bad Boys II' is a waste of your time and a waste of celluloid. **",Bad Boys II

That scene was an endurance filled high powered car chase and the car that Mike Lowrey used, the Ferrari 550 Maranello was and is an absolutely brilliant car. Dt Mike Lowrey is a tough cop who is not to be messed with and Dt Marcus Burnett (played by Martin Lawrence) is also a tough cop, but sometimes annoys Mike Lowrey because Marcus talks too much and doesn't do things the right way.

117,Ronin47,"Homophobia, rat sex, and jokes about dead bodies. Yay! (No Stars)",1,19 October 2003,"I haven't felt this much hostility while watching a movie in a long time. I think I actually wanted to HURT the filmmakers for subjecting me to this.
First of all, I should say that I liked the original 1995 ""Bad Boys"". It was a big, dumb action movie, but it was funny, exciting, and had fun characters played by Will Smith, Martin Lawrence, and Tea Leoni (who is wisely MIA from this turd of a sequel). Now, 8 years later, for no other reason than to make a lot of money, the stars and director Michael Bay (who hasn't directed a single good movie since the original ""Bad Boys"") have conspired to unleash this atrocity on the public. I don't even know where to start. I went in with an open mind, but that ended with the first scene, with the awful KKK jokes and an extended ""I shot my partner in the butt!"" scene that was so funny I forgot to laugh.
I can't say enough that this movie is excruciating. Not funny, not interesting, not exciting, and even offensive. I have no problem with gore, but a movie needs to find the right tone before expecting to get laughs from corpses tumbling from a morgue van and getting run over by cars, and in this movie it's just sickening. As if that wasn't enough, the movie is unnervingly homophobic at times, which is just depressing. One scene that actually comes close to being funny is ruined when it moves from being playfully homophobic to being outright offensive. It's also 2 1/2 hours long, which is just stupid. That makes even the action scenes boring (though I admit to a twinge of interest for a second or two during the big freeway chase). This a terrible, cruel, mean-spirited, stupid, revolting movie. If it were a person, it would be a big jerk who thinks it's sexy to pick fights in bars.
Oh yeah, and there's also a scene with a sight gag of two rats having sex. Missionary style. Suddenly, I want to hurt the filmmakers again.",Bad Boys II

Some funny lines are beat to death, and become annoying.  The quirky characters become annoying or dissapear from the film completly.  I could go on and on.  What this movie boils down to is that it is all glam and no substance.  Although, if you are seeing this film, than this is what you are expecting.",Bad Boys II
120,troy-daniel-bush,Ughhhhhh,1,21 October 2019,"Like most of Michael Bay's filmography, this movie fails on every level.The action is overblown and obnoxious.
The humor is painfully unfunny.
The editing is tantamount to Bohemian Rhapsody.
The writing is downright embarrassing. ""Can't you get a better car than that?"" Yeah, it's really important that you arrive on the scene looking good, guys! It's not like time is of the essence and you have to stop a bunch of murderous Cuban drug dealers. Excellent police-work!
And I can't stand Marcus. He's so unlikable that every time he was in a gun fight, I wanted him to get shot in the head.
And Will Smith is just Will Smith. ""Wow. A must-see.""",Bad Boys II

122,pacman-81,Same but too much action,7,13 May 2020,If nots broke don't fix it. Following on from the superb Bad Boys the sequel takes all the good things from the film but adds way too much action. The car chases are too long and extreme however the fundamentals from the first movie are still there. Lawrence and Smith are hilarious as the bickering best friends trying to take down a Cuban drug lord. Martin Lawrence continues steal every scene with his panicked humour.A worthy addition to the franchise. Woooosaaah,Bad Boys II
123,clydestuff,$130 Million Dollar sequel that proves more is messier,3,18 April 2004,"If there's anything at all you'll find memorable about BAD BOYS II, it will be the noise level.  I'm not just talking about the explosions and the car chases and the gunfire and still more explosions and still more car chases and still more gunfire.  You'll remember all of that, but to fill in the noise gaps in between the action sequences, Director Michael Bay has his whole cast yelling during the rest of the film as if one quiet moment would destroy his loud and noisy caper.  Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) yells at his partner and friend Mike Lowery  (Wil Smith), Lowery yells back at him, Captain Howard (Joe Pantoliano) yells at Burnett and Lowery, Johnny Tapia (Jordi Mollá) yells at everybody, Burnett's sister Syd (Gabrielle Union) yells at Barnett, then yells at Lowery, and in the most excruciatingly idiotic scene in the film, Barnett and Lowery yell at a young fellow who is taking Burnett's daughter out on her first date.  Yep, It's one yell of a movie. And that about sums up Bad Boys II, the big budgeted overblown extravaganza that spends $130 million dollars and takes up two and a half hours of your time letting you know that making a sequel to a film as lousy as the original BAD BOYS just doesn't work, no matter how much money you spend on mayhem and chaos.As you know from the first film, Burnett and Lowery are friends and partners that work in the Miami Police Department.  In this outing they are out to clean up the drug trading and money laundering operations of Cuban kingpin Johnny Tapia.  At the same time Burnett's sister Syd is working undercover for the DEA to achieve the same goal. The plot is simple enough, as it would have to be because anything more intricate might interfere with the excessive on screen havoc manufactured by Bay.One of the biggest questions I have after having viewed both of the BAD BOYS films is how did these two characters ever became friends let alone partners?  After listening to Burnett and Lowery spend the better portion of two films letting each other know how many things they hate about each other, how can we be expected to care one iota for either character?  The only hint we are ever given is to why these guys are so buddy buddy are given in this film, and only because of an inscription in an old high school yearbook that is laid out as a minor plot device.  Burnett and Lowery have so little respect for each other, you would think they'd have gotten a divorce before the sequel ever made it to celluloid.Then there's Burnett's family life.  As in the original Bad Boys, it is used here also as either a plot device or a set up for what is supposed to be a comedic interlude.  One joke about a swimming pool is straight out of the Jerry Lewis handbook of pratfalls and misadventures and is as lacking in humor as most of Lewis's later films were.  Yet we not only are subjected to this joke once, but twice.  Well, maybe the French will like it.  The other joke has to do with the aforementioned date of Burnett's daughter.  What Bay should have done is taken a look at the Lethal Weapons films.  In those films Danny Glover's home life was at times a plot device, but we were also given some true insight into his relationship with his wife and kids which gave Glover's character a human element that Burnett sorely lacks.Lest we forget, there's also Burnett's sister Syd, the DEA officer from New York.  The reason she is Burnett's sister is so that we can have a running joke about what Lowery may or may not have done with her when he made a trip to the Big Apple.  Also, when and if Burnett finds out, it gives him another reason to dislike Lowery.  As if he really needed one.  Late in the film Syd is also used as another plot device to help move our story to Cuba, something that could have been done without making her Syd's sister, and had her just be the girlfriend of Lowery.  Thinking about it now, the whole film might have been much more interesting if she had just been introduced as Lowery's girlfriend and Bay had left the sister plot in the trash compactor where it belonged.Since most of the audience of this film is here for the action, the film doesn't falter in that regard.  If that's what you want to see you'll certainly get your money's worth and then some.  The problem is that there are too many car chases, too many shoot outs, and they all go on for what seems like more than an eternity.  Watching this film in the theater, Bay does as always and cuts his action sequences in such a way that watching them in a theater, makes everything almost impossible to follow.  I think Bay considers filming action sequences this way as showing true chaos.  All I see is a big mess.  Having viewed the film a second time on DVD before writing this review, I can honestly say this is one time where big action sequences actually play better on a smaller screen.  At least you won't become nauseated as you more than likely did during one sequence when Burnett is standing flush against the wall holding his arms outstretched, guns in both hands, and the camera circling around him like it was filming a ballet sequence.  The shot is pointless, and adds nothing to the sequence, although it would have been a good place to use a product placement ad for Pepto Bismol.In another scene that should have been used to build suspense, Bay plays it for one big cheap laugh instead.  It has to do with Lowery and Burnett posing as exterminators in order to plant surveillance cameras in Johnny Tapia's rat infested mansion.  I didn't find it funny, just stupid, much in the same way I found many of the scenes in this film that used gross out moments to elicit a cheap laugh.  If you find the thought of police cars running over someone's deceased family members humorous, then you'll probably have a big guffaw, but you're not somebody I'd care to know.Enough people in the U.S. liked BAD BOYS II well enough to put $138 million in the Sony coffers.  Enough people overseas liked it enough to add another $134 to the Sony Bank Account.  What that means is between film gross and DVD sales, we could definitely be in danger of having BAD BOYS III thrust upon us.  And when I feel as if I'm in danger of having to sit through a third mess, I have no choice but to give BAD BOYS II my grade which is a D-.",Bad Boys II

127,metalrox_2000,"decent sequel, not not an equal",5,21 December 2005,"There was so much that could have bee done, such as make the film shorter. Martin Lawrence and Will Smith's banter with each other doesn't have the same appeal that it did in the first one, as here it looks like they went mainly for the laughs, and the jokes come off somewhat forced. yes, there are many explosions that will satisfy the average viewer. But there are some scenes, and several other items that seem off. First off, how many EMT's do you know of that swear while on the radio, and use ethnic slurs. Here, the writers are not aware that yes, business and other places that use CB radio's do in some respects have to abide by FCC rules. But in the scene where Smith and Lawrence break into the Shady Palms mortuary, the undercovers swear left and right, and use racial slurs that were completely not needed. Second, John Sally's Fletecher character has gone from a convict in the first film, to being a member of the police department! I'm not sure how Florida's law may work in reality, but I'm not sure of many police outfits that allow former felons to join their ranks. There's also way too much convience for my taste, seeing how a member of the police force has a brother who is a member of the underground movement against Castro in Cuba, and the captain has connections to the CIA. ?! Much of the final act of the film is rather implausible in many respects, and no care seems to be given for the drivers of the Hummer that gets Smith and Lawrence's characters into Tapia's compound. Just the ease of which we are led to believe Lowery and Marcus arrive is utterly implausible. Had the producers tried to not outsmart themselves, had the final act not felt so force, and had the film been at least twenty minutes shorter, the film would have been great. Too much excess, too much banter for the action to be taken seriously, and way, way too many implausible instances hurt the film. There is a thing called suspension of disbelief, but this film ask for discontinued belief. After the long layoff following the first one, this Should have been way better. Alas, Bad Boys bows out with a muddled mess.",Bad Boys II
128,MacAindrais,"Bad Boys, Bad Movies",1,3 October 2006,"Bad Boys II (2003) No Stars I've been trying lately only to review movies that I consider to be great movies, or random new releases that I get time to review. And so, this review is different. It's a movie that was made three years ago, and its the exact opposite of great. I hated this movie so much that months after finally watching the whole thing (I had to watch this ""movie"" in pieces because I felt as if I was going to have to stab my eyes out) I feel I can finally review this thing. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are Miami cops cracking down on a Cuban drug king, played by Jordi Molla. Martin Lawrences sister, Syd (Gabrielle Union) is also involved undercover in a federal investigation, and of course things get freaky with her and Will Smith's character. Blah blah blah, roll the clichés and super ""cool"" dialog, insert a chase scene that sees about a million cars get destroyed while Will Smith drives his Ferarri through the carnage at 200 mph unscathed, slap on some random catch phrases and a cheesy ending and BANG, you have Bad Boys II. Doesn't sound like much? It isn't. You could say that the movie is just mindless action, but to say that it is mindless would excuse its insulting of morality and intelligence to the viewer. If it would be mindless it wouldn't know better. Michael Bay does know better, but that doesn't stop Bad Boys II from being cruel and down right offensive to mindless movies everywhere. The movie thinks that it's being funny when it's just being cruel, and one scene in particular made me cringe and made me want to run out and burn posters of Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. That scene involves the pair driving their fancy Hummer through a shanty town on a hillside. We're talking a slum, where the poorest people you could imagine live. The Hummer plows through the houses tearing them apart. This would have killed dozens of poor people. But do they care? No, they're driving their big yellow Hummer, having a ball. Sure they try to say that the village had been making drugs, but so what? I'm sure the kids and innocents who lived in those houses might have something to say about that. This movie left me with a bad taste in my mouth that shows up every time I hear someone say ""Bad,"" or ""Boys,"" or ""2."" That this piece of cinematic junk has 6.1 rating on IMDb is mind blowing. It's a testament to the stupidity of the modern movie audience.

The two funniest scenes are when Burnett and Lowery are scaring the hell out of Burnett's daughter's date and after the chase scene with the dead bodies and Captain Howard goes off on the two. Absolutely hilarious! My only gripe is that it seemed that the writers were running low on material and resorted to gross-out humor like rats having sex and corpses losing their heads. Not funny.

However, it's mostly flash and bang. The special effects are satisfactory and the cinematography is respectable, but the plot is really shallow. I could have cared less about what was going on most of the time. This movie is not a thinker, that much is clear.

I mean, Bad Boys, the original way back in 1995, was an OK movie, what it lacked in story construction it made up in heart. So I expected a lot from BBII, thinking that, since it had taken 8 years to get around to a sequel, they had to be making a decent job of it, right? Wrong, SO WRONG!This movie is so bad in so many ways I just couldn't get it all into the 1000 word limit.***MAJOR SPOILERS COMING UP *** (although how you can spoil a bad movie I am not sure!)So we have a plot, that is just dummmmb - I am sick of all this cops-getting-into-therapy crap, wooo haaaaaa, or whatever they were saying all the time. I want real cops, and sure they can have therapy if they want to, but lets cut the crapola out of the dialog, is makes me want to puke.Mike falls for Marcus sister, who of course is gorgeous, that seems OK, but of course it's a secret, a la Lethal Weapon IV. Then she has to be DEA, which would be good except she starts the movie off seeming incredibly competent, brilliant driving skills, Ok with her gun, then she turns into this bimbo who just is in the plot for the sake of being there and looking good since she really has nothing to do - very predictable.But, apart from the gratuitous violence of some of the drug mob characters (and some of it, especially dismembering people, which seems to happen a lot in this movie and quite unnecessarily), and the ludicrous car chase scene, what is there left? Not much.What I would like to know, and I pose this question to everyone who has seen this movie, is this... why doesn't the Cuban drug lord just shoot Marcus' sister and leg it with his dosh? I mean, why would he drag her along to Cuba, other than so we could have a ridiculous rescue the damsel in distress and blow some sh** up sequence? And how come she just went along with him, without even putting up a fight at all? Considering the drug lord dismembered a Russian dude just to prove a point to his Russian boss-friend, the idea that he would bother to drag along the DEA bimbo is stupid, but what the hell, the entire movie was a let down, why should I have expected anything more.Bad Boys (the original) had so many writers on it that apparently the major writing contributors refused to have their names put in the credits, they were that upset by the end result. Well my God, I wonder who really wrote this dross, because if it was me, I certainly wouldn't want my name to come up on such an unoriginal, totally forgettable, bland and ludicrous script as this.Shame on everyone involved in this movie - the one redeeming part of this was the pairing of Lawrence and Smith again, it's just a shame they didn't demand a better script to work from - I gave this 5 out of 10, but I really do feel now I was WAY overly generous!",Bad Boys II
135,filmbuff-36,Bad Boys who should be put in the big house,5,25 July 2003,"Watching a Jerry Bruckheimer produced film is the cinematic equivalent of consuming empty calories. It will fill you up, but it ends up taking up space that could be occupied by things that are better for you.""Bad Boys II"" is no exception to this rule.  Director Michael Bay is a filmmaker fully grounded in Bruckheimer's rule of box office hit: bigger, louder and faster are better. Bay makes the movie snap along at a quick beat and there are plenty of action-packed sequences, all filmed with a post-John Woo flair for slow motion, kinetic action, random explosions and macho posturing during the middle of chaos. Oh, and there's a story hidden in here somewhere as well.Martin Lawrence and Will Smith return as detectives Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowrery, respectively, two Miami narcotics officers who are magnets for acts of violence and leave war zones in their wake. As the film begins, they are cracking down on a drug cartel trafficking ecstasy in Southern Florida. Years of tension between the two police officers is starting to take its toll on Burnett, who is secretly plotting to transfer out of the squad because of all the stress he must endure being partnered with Lowrery.This anxiety is further compounded by the fact that Lowrery has the hots for Burnett's sister Sydney (Gabrielle Union), a DEA agent who, as fate would have it, is working a different angle on the same case. Apparently a major Cuban drug dealer named Johnny Tapia (Jordi Mollà) is trying to muscle his competition in Miami through various degrees of violence, and is working with Ms. Burnett, whose cover is a crooked banker laundering his money.Really, after that bit of exposition, the rest of the film writes itself. What follows are some of the most incredible action scenes ever filmed, including a twenty-minute sequence that starts as a heist gone wrong, turns into a car chase, changes into a violent shootout, and then turns back into a car chase involving an 18-wheeler dumping the cars it's transporting along the MacArthur Causeway.The action scenes are, in essence, the only reason to watch the film. The rest of the movie is a downright mess. The characters are poorly written and unmemorable, the dialogue unbelievable under certain situations, and the narrative full of needless `comic' excursions and cornball scenery chewing. And all I can say is thank goodness for the Internet Movie Database, otherwise I wouldn't have remembered the names of half the characters in the film.The problem with ""Bad Boys II"" is that like most summer releases for the last decade, it completely throws common sense out the window. The main characters leave chaos and mayhem behind them and never once are given a reprimand for their actions. The movie apparently wants to have all the fun of large scale pandemonium without all the consequences (deaths of innocent by-standers, lawsuits, suspensions, etc.). And villains are not human beings; they're just pop up arcade targets that exist only to be bullet fodder.34 years ago when Sam Peckinpah gave us ""The Wild Bunch,"" the first modern day action film, large scale violence was both exhilarating and scary.  It showed us the horrors of aimless gunfire and the cost of recklessness; bloody and mutilated human beings, loss of respect for human life and families destroyed.  It's sad to see that in 2003, following a similar scene that seemingly would leave numerous innocent people orphaned or widowed, Will Smith's character chooses to chew out his partner for accidentally putting a few bullet holes in his Ferrari.Just be thankful he didn't bad-talk your mama, too.5 out of 10 stars: the action scenes were good but everything else reeked.",Bad Boys II
136,JAKastner,The Moose Hole - Review of Bad Boys II,7,19 July 2003,"There is nothing more reliable to the major studios of Hollywood more then sequels. That had been a known fact within the movie industry until recently. Sequels were once made only for films that had made more then a few million more then their production budget or had been critically accepted by the American public. That isn't so any more. The original Charlie's Angels and Tomb Raider films made more then their budget, not too much though, but had been hammered by the public. And yet sequels were made anyway and Full Throttle has proven the sequels are as reliable as they once were. Another truth about sequels was that you never made one to a film that was more then a few years from the original but films like Terminator 3 and Bad Boys II have gone against that truth. Though Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines has proven to be a success, it surely looks to not live up to the success of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, which debuted on the same weekend in 1991. Will Bad Boys II follow the same path? One can make argument that it could but it has many good things going for it. Jerry Bruckheimer, who had failure with Bad Company last summer, has been on a roll lately with the success of Pirates of the Caribbean just a week before the opening of Bad Boys II and whenever he teams up with good friend and director Michael Bay, there always seems to be success. Look at films like the original Bad Boys, Armageddon and Pearl Harbor for examples. But like it has been said before, nothing can be reliable now days. Will Bad Boys II falter under sequelitis or will it be able to end the summer with a bang?The story revolves around the original Bad Boys as they attempt to take down another drug lord in the city of Miami. Only this time they appear to be bigger, badder, and, hopefully, wiser then in the first installment. A couple of things have changed since the original film. The friendship and partnership between Mike Lowery and Marcus Burnett has suffered greatly, mostly to the drastic shoot-'em up tactics of Mike who, in an effort to save the life of his partner, accidentally shoots a bullets that slices through his partner's butt cheek. Marcus can't take this kind of pressure anymore and asks for a transfer with the acknowledgment of his partner. Marcus isn't the only one with secrets as Mike has quietly been dating Marcus' sister, Syd, for a couple of months. Eventually these secrets will have to come out but not until they have completed an important mission to save the city of Miami from rivaling drug dealers. A Cuban drug lord has grown tired of losing money and ground in the drug market, so he begins to set off a drug war within the city itself allowing him to reap in all the profits will rival gangs kill each other and innocent teens overdose on ecstasy. The Bad Boys much put aside their differences even when their secrets come out because Syd soon becomes involved and her life is at stake. The story for Bad Boys II is pretty confusing and unless you really pay attention or are narcotic detectives, you will be lost within the first hour of the film. But sticking to a straight forward story does not apply in Bruckheimer films as they seem to focus more on the action sequences then realism. The problem with the film is that it seems to rely too much on that fact but comes off as being too overtop for many to accept fully. Bay and Bruckheimer seem to ask too much from the audience this time around then they did in the original which hurts the film greatly.Outside of Lawrence and Smith, there really wasn't too much of a cast in the original film. That is slightly this time around as there are plenty of cast members that are focused on beside the amazing duo. Some do a better job then others as not every single character within the film works on the same level. Though the characters Lawrence and Smith play seem to have problems with each other in the film, that doesn't seem to be the case involving the two actors as they seem to play very well off each other. They even seem to work better together then in the original film. Smith is hilarious in the film though his repeating like `Hell no' and such three times seems to get tiresome. Lawrence is great as well and his character doesn't get to a point where he is too annoying. Gabrielle Union takes on the role of Syd, the love interest of Smith's character and the sister of Lawrence's. The problem with her character is that there aren't that many scenes where she is giving a chance to show her full range of acting ability. Another problem is that she seems to be missing for good portions of the film until she is needed again later in the story. Joe Pantoliano, who plays the captain of the narcotic detective division, is great but he is also missing for good portions of the film as two members of his team members run rampit in Miami crashing cars and destroying tons of public property.Overall, Bad Boys II is just another good action popcorn flick but one that seems to ask way too much from its audience. Many of the action sequences in the film seem too over the top for anybody to really believe even within a Bruckheimer film. There seems to be too much of everything in this film. Too much foul language was used with the words sh*t and f**k and n***er being said almost every five minutes of the feature. Sure, many of them were used in a comical way but even so, it seemed to be too much. There also seemed to be an excess amount of sex and violence within the film including a pornographic scene involving a black woman in a car and far too many scenes where characters have their brains blown out. Even the time length of the film is too much at a longer then usual two hours and forty minutes. But the comedy presented by Will Smith and Martin Lawrence was too funny to have the bad outweigh the good. They present a style to the film that make the tiresome experience worthwhile. Though the film can not be as highly recommended as Bruckheimer's other film, Pirates if the Caribbean, it is worth checking out during a lazy afternoon.",Bad Boys II
137,actionmoviestar,"Impressive, funny action epic",9,30 October 2005,"In the spring of 1995, there was a little action movie directed by a then unknown music video director by the name of Michael Bay and starred two rising stars named Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. This film was known as ""Bad Boys"" and was a mid-level hit for Columbia Pictures and turned Michael Bay into a action maestro and most importantly solidified Will Smith and Martin Lawrence status as future box-office stars. Eight years and many movies later, Smith, Lawrence and Bay return, bringing us the much anticipated sequel ""Bad Boys II."" First off I want to say that this movie exceeded all my expectations. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence proves again that they still have the chemistry together. Bad Boys II was well directed, visually stunning and much whitier than it's predecessor. I'm perhaps most impressed at the character development because if you seen the first film, you would noticed that Smith's character was the laid back, easy going type and Lawrence's character was the uptight, edgy, ready to bust a cap in a mother's face type of guy. In this film the roles are reversed and works perfectly.The stunts are so elaborate and proves that Michael Bay is definitely the king of action movies. The freeway scene, is probably one of the best action sequences in recent years and totally kicks ""The Matrix Reloaded"" freeway scene's arse. I never understood why this film got so many bad reviews. This film is probably one of the better action films of the 2000's.Above all, if you're a fan of Michael Bay, Will Smith or Martin Lawrence, this movie will sure to please you.",Bad Boys II

It involves drugs, Cubans and all the other clichés but at the end of the day what actually makes this film is the wonderful and hilarious partnership between Martin Lawrence and Will Smith. Their chemistry makes the film worth watching. It's like they're only playing it for fun which makes it even more enjoyable because you can just relax and watch just for fun.I regret I haven't seen the first film but I know that this one is a great film to watch to relax, you don't have to think and you can just have fun. Yes it's explicit, but I've seen more serious films with more swearing and random sex scenes.",Bad Boys II
139,jfcthejock,A Good Sequel To A Buddy Comedy Classic.,8,9 June 2008,"OK, where do I start? This is a sequel to the buddy classic of 1995, Bad Boys. Again we have the usual camaraderie of two old friends who are also partners in the police, non-stop action and stunts that keep the average action junkie interested like myself. As for plot and storyline, I would say Bad Boys 2 has a reasonable one. I could compare Bad Boys 2 to the original, and come up short with anything new but what I do come up with is the same as with the original. Bad Boys 2 gives us more of what the first film had, only this time in 2003 and not 1995.Weapons change, cars change but the same gist of the film remains the same. Action galore in fact for us action junkies, car chases that end in havoc and chaos. Explosions that tear city blocks apart and the occasional joke preceding each one. A good sequel to follow off from the original and yet again another great action flick for a late Friday night in with your friends.",Bad Boys II

141,arnieiam,A Ride,8,14 May 2008,"I was 13 years old when this movie came out but it was released in India for only 2 weeks and was then pulled out of the theatres. So I didn't get to see it until I got a hold of the DVD. Before I saw the DVD I only watched the trailer of this movie many times. And that just kept on building up the anticipation for me. My friends saw it when it came out and they too were 13 so they kept on telling me that this movie was indecent and had a lot of bad language. But this movie's R-rated what do you expect? Anyways I finally saw this movie and I was so blown away by its action sequences I really did not give a damn about its bad language or its indecency. This movie was a ride that kept me going and I had no clue that 2 and a half hours just went by. The only thing though is that since this movie was more walk and less talk, some parts of the plot just had me puzzled and I wondered what happened to some of the characters.As a kid who grew up in the 90s buddy cop films were very popular, and I just wanna thank Martin and Will for bringing that back into the 2000s with some extra bang.And the soundtrack was tight, especially that song by Fat Joe, Diddy and Dre. Also this movie was one of the reasons why I became a fan of the Miami Heat.All together, if you want to stay at home and still have fun, get Bad Boys 2.",Bad Boys II

And yet it's so LONG. More than anything else, it resembles one of those ""movies"" made out of condensed serials.

The humor doesn't work even on the half-ass level of the original, but the action has picked up pace. And even though Mollà is nowhere near as good as the villain Tcheky Karyo was, he pulls an ok if a bit boring performance. I'd just like to point out that Will Smith is a hell of a lot better and accomplished actor than Martin Lawrence. What in the world is his name doing SECOND in the opening credits?! After films like Black Knight, What's the Worst That Could Happen?, National Security and Big Momma's House, Lawrence should be forced to drop to his knees and thank God for still having a career in the first place. He doesn't deserve it. Maybe I'll sleep better if I keep lying to myself by thinking the credits are in alphabetical order.*** / *****",Bad Boys II
146,benjamin_lappin,Just Pointless,2,30 November 2005,"The first Bad Boys film, was a breath of fresh air into two genres. Firstly the overly populated genre of the 80's and 90's action film fests, with gratuitous violence and layers of ladened expletives (i'm not condemning that, I quite like it e.g Predator et al), and secondly into the cop-buddy film genre, sparked off by the brilliant Lethal Weapon. The first Bad Boys talk the great elements from both and created a film that was intriguing, well designed, funny and above all a good romp.Bay Boys II fails on ALL accounts, bar, possibly, the ""funny"" aspect. The second installment has lost the rugged ""streetness"", if you will, the first one possessed and in turn gone for big budget special effects and car chases, which make me feel that when this script was being written the words, Kick Arse Car Chase, or something of that ilk was grafted above specific scenes. The acting is pretty poor. Martin Lawrence has his little moment in the spotlight where he tries to convey the severity of the situation, towards the end of the film, ""The S**t just got real""-speech, and really it is truly awful. Thankfully this is redeemed not but two minutes later by Will Smiths more subtle and tastefully done ""we ride together, we die together"".The premise of the script is quite basic. It is your standard ""going out with his sister, not letting him know"" type, and predictable throughout. While predictability is not necessarily an issue, it does detract from further events.Believe me, I know there are a lot of pre pubescents, and people with decidedly low IQs who have posted positive reviews about the marvels this film gives us, but frankly there isn't. I watch this film and think, hmm well it is ""pretty cool"" in terms of violence and car chasing (as I indeed love that), but with some many films doing the same old thing this really wasn't the breath of fresh air everyone expected it to be. It was no Bad Boys. Too much action is great, but when it's mere action for the sake of action, it becomes very old, very fast. The rotational gun fight, whilst interesting and well done, screamed of a Matrix ripoff.This film can be summed up by the HIDEOUS!!!! acting by Lawrence and Smiths female costar, at the end of this film, where she has her little moment to save the day. I shan't spoil it by saying what she says, but whenever she says it I expect it to be followed by an evil maniacal laugh. You'll see what i mean!",Bad Boys II

I know action films are meant to be entertaining and lack narrative cohesion and realism but this takes it to a new level with every scene bordering on the implausible and laughably stupid. The whole thing is so overblown and predictable it will give you a headache. Throw in Michael Bay's typically showy, pompous slow-mo, swooning, swish-panny camera, a predictable storyline that tries to create conflict, your stereotypical euro-villain and a sense of how much money and talent and destruction one can throw in every scene and you have a completely overblown, brains at the door action extravaganza.5/10",Bad Boys II

154,dima-12,action masterpiece!,10,16 November 2003,"BAD BOYS 2 is the film that justifies any prejudice against violent Hollywood cinema. However the trouble with current Hollywod cinema is the lack of violent and tasteless bits. Instead of providing the controversial juice, Hollywood cinema was submitted to political correnctness. BAD BOYS 2 breaks every PC rule and comes off as a hidden gem in season 2003. At last we face the contemporary police action comedy that is nutritious and deeply sunk into the unhealthy gravy of grindhouse cinema.MPAA distracted the evolution of violent cop flicks. This is why the formula or the genre failed to grow ever since the peaks from the eighties like LETHAL WEAPON or 48 HRS or early nineties as in THE LAST BOY SCOUT or POINT BREAK. The genre even retarded in the meantime. This is why BAD BOYS 2 makes me happy since it overcomes the missing links of genre evolution and shows us how exploitation should look like in 2003. It is especially significant since the BAD BOYS franchise relies on legacy of LETHAL WEAPON partnership chemistry and BEVERLY HILLS COP ethnic controversy. With the sequels it shapes the legacy of its` own.Action set-pieces are impressive, without too many digital shots. The action is imagined, staged and shot with flair. Bay spent a lot of money on this one and he tried to do whatever he could with mechanical effects. So the physical aspect of action is present and enjoyed in this one.Comedy is funny, dark, and dirty thanks to writer Jerry Stahl, the man who lived on the edge for a while. And guys like Shane Black, the guys who spent years living on the edge. Characters are mythically stylized and authors manage to persuade us for 144 minutes (golden rule-every masterful actioner is longer than 130 minutes) that there is a world where all women look like supermodels, where every car is the latest roadster, where bullets casually spin around, and where heavy gunfights witn enormous bodycounts are an everyday routine, and all cops look like as if they just stepped out of PREDATOR.BAD BOYS 2 carries a direct right-wing agenda. It feels as a reply to Michael Moore`s BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE. Without any restrictions, this film celebrates the machismo, the gun fetish and law enforcement jingoism. Beides BAD BOYS 2 feasts upon the xenophobic sentiment, anti-Communism (the villains are of Russian and Cuban origin) and the fear of domestic traitors (KKK deals drugs). This film also bashes bureaucracy and human rights initiative that are used as shelter for knon criminals with sm,art lawyers. Invasion of Cuba, in the climax, puts a smile on every right-winger`s face.To sum things up, BAD BOYS 2 is the major return to blueprints set by late Don Simpson, With Michael bay at the helm, this Bruckeheimer productiom marches toward Don Simpson`s roots. Simpson would like to see this crude and violent hyperkinetic piece of film. And he`d like to see his protege overcoming the status of low-grade quick-cutting pioneer. He`d enjoy seeing Michael Bay grow into a full-blooded auteur that comes of age with this film and delivers one of the bravest and most authentic blockbusters of the decade.",Bad Boys II

First of all, don't see this movie if you have something in your hand to eat. You will definitely ""toss your cookies."" Secondly, what a waste of the chemistry between Smith and Lawrence. I was looking forward to the exchange of wit like in the first movie.  I was so disappointed that the tone of this movie was such a drastic change from the first movie which had lighthearted touches here and there.  I admit the highway chase scene was awesome but that's about it. This is just a mean spirited movie that never lets up. *SPOILERS* As I have mentioned in other reviews for summer movies, the action sequences and plots are typically implausible but the Cuba aspect of this movie is just plain ridiculous.

Smith has improved as an actor since then, although is still not great, and Lawrence, while still one dimensional, was more eccentric in this. This is about 2 1/2 hours of extreme violence and mean spirited humour. Like, I didn't get offended by anything as I'm not easily offended, but I still didn't find a lot of the supposed humour funny, such as corpses falling out of vans and being decapitated by moving cars, or a 15-year-old boy with a gun to his head for dating Burnett's daughter. However, the movie moved fast and was usually entertaining, with lots of explosions and shoot-outs to keep you interested. The action scenes were sublime, very well shot and produced. A movie of this sort doesn't really need to be 2 1/2 hours, but this wasn't boring or anything. I'd recommend it to people of mature age, but DO NOT let kids near it.",Bad Boys II

161,mozli,"Expensively, excessively tasteless sequel",3,4 May 2005,"I got to see it for free. Hmmmm. Two genuinely funny moments in this sequel that we really didn't need. Its interesting that movies like this lift plot points from much better films and blow up the action to larger than human scale. I noticed rip offs of Hitchcock, Peckinpah, Di Palma and Mack Sennett. Martin Lawrence is not improving as an actor. Will Smith sort of coasts thru the whole thing knowing he probably doesn't have to do this anymore. When you see up and coming actors struggling against odds to make some logical sense of this you see some heroism in cinema. Gabrielle Union is very impressive and every time she appears you know she is working very hard to make this a better(or at least more credible) movie and her scenes with Jordi Molla have some grace and intelligence which probably goes over the head of the target audience for this film. When John Salley can act you off the screen its time to get back to acting class. Theresa Randle and Joe Pantoliano...just wasted. What the heck was Peter Stormare thinking!!?!? Marg Helgenberger made the right move and said no to this project(paycheck aside). Great stunt choreography(naturally), editing that makes sure we get all the viscera just before the punchline. The thing that really bothers me about the series is the redneck sensibility underneath all the pseudo-up-to-the minute black tough guy street vernacular. Insulting to one's intelligence doesn't quite get at what the ""film"" does to me. Again, there were two very funny bits but that isn't enough for a 147 minute experience like this. I fully expect a BAD BOYS III. I'd like them to do something radical and have a black villain this time. Dennis Haysbert could peel both of these clowns off the screen.I had to come back to this to see some of the other submissions and the fans of this movie are a mystifying group to say the least(over 40 pages of reviews) but I don't expect any of them to run out and buy the IRREVERSIBLE DVD anytime soon like I recently did.

164,m0rg16,I was disappointed.,1,6 February 2004,"I had heard both good and bad things about this movie, when I finally rented it, hoping that Will Smith and Martin Lawrence could at least crack a few jokes for me to laugh at. Boy was I disappointed.This movie is, of course, an action comedy. Well, here's the problem... Mostly the action is totally uninteresting or confusing, and the humour is pretty much non-stop. Too bad about every joke fall flat. This movies dialouge consists of Will Smith and Martin Lawrence running around and cracking one-liners at each other at a startling rate. Amusing? Not the least. The most used word in this movie has got to be ""shoot"". ""Shoot her, shoot him, shoot them, he shot himself, they are shooting at us!"" etc. etc. They say shoot all the time, and that pretty much also sums up the movie.When Will Smith and Martin Lawrence aren't walking about cracking one-liners they are shooting. Shooting at jamaicans, shooting at russians, shooting at cubans, shooting at pretty much everyone. And they aren't really rolemodel policemen either. ""Hey, he's got a gun. Let's shoot him."". Wow. How amusing.
As I stated before, the action is mostly uninteresting and confusing. But sometimes, it lightens up. During one of the many car chases there comes a moment where a terrorist is hanging on a car door, and it opens up and smashes against a pillar. This was a nice moment, even if it was just effect. Some other nice moments happen during the jamaican shootout.So pretty much, to sum this movie up its: Pointless and boring dialogue with one or two jokes that are funny plus heaps of mindless, uninteresting and confusing action, along with a few nice action moments.I'd rate it a 4/10. There's definetly alot better of stuff to rent out there, and I wouldn't really want to recommend this to anyone, unless they are a DIE hard fan of both Will Smith and Martin Lawrence.Oh, and if you thought that there wouldn't be any bullet-time effects in this movie, you're wrong...",Bad Boys II

It's garbage of the highest degree; you could cut an hour out of the running time without fearing that the movie would make less sense. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence have a definite chemistry, but it is utterly wasted here.

Not so with Bad Boys 2, which could easily have been made in 1985.On the other hand there are some great action scenes and the freeway chase is ALMOST as much fun as the one in The Matrix Reloaded.  It's incredibly sick instead of being blackly funny like Grosse Pointe Blank.

I liked how they actually destroyed the cars and how they really blew up that mansion, no fake model stuff.  This was just as cool as the first movie was but a little bit better and cooler.

Other people would love it because they would see it as a thrill a minute, kick ass and cool experience. While I can understand why some would have a negative opinion of this movie, I happen to enjoy it. The dialogue at times was sharp witty and at times funny, and the tension as the story builds towards its explosive climax could be cut with a knife. A few faults would be the pacing was inconsistent, slow at times, then suddenly picks up, on occasion the dialogue was a bit cheesy and macho and some of the action was a tad unrealistic, but at the same time fun. The cast by and large were solid, and the chemistry between Will Smith and Martin Lawrence as partners who happen to be polar opposites when it comes to personality makes the movie work, and Joe Pantoliano as the beleaguered police captain gives a very good impression of someone at the end of his tether thanks to the antics of Mike and Marcus. Onto the villains, Jordi Molla turns in a frightening performance as Johnny Tapia, whose laid back demeanor hides a ruthless and merciless personality, likewise Peter Stormare as the Russian mobster whose muscled out by Tapia in the drug distribution business. The movie depicts a three way criminal drug and turf war between Cuban Russian and Jamaican gangsters on the streets of Miami with the police caught in the crossfire, and shows how ruthless the bad guys can be when it comes to dealing with those who would get in their way, and how explosive the results can be. One of those movies which I like but I can understand why others may not.",Bad Boys II
170,nEoFILM,What ya gonna do this time?,6,11 March 2012,"Whilst the first outing of the Bad Boys shocked me by how good it actually was, this one left me a little disappointed. I was hardly expecting an Oscar winning deal here, as this was always going to be a Michael Bay adrenalin rush, but for a film with a two and a half hour running time, the adrenalin came in too short a bursts.Bad Boys was Bay's first film and was but a taster of his over the top film making, which first arrives in The Rock a year afterwards, but this made eight years later was obviously going to take this to the next level, if not several levels further than that. But to me, it didn't. Granted, the action was thrilling, outrageous and very enjoyable, but the character development was barely visible. They bicker, Lawrence moaned a lot and Smith was cool and likable but there was just a shell of what there should have been. The entire story, including what's left of their character dynamics are only present to set up the next great action sequence.Then, the was the taste issue. The crux of the plot as it developed was that the drug dealing villains where using corpses to smuggle drugs, and this was used to ""Comic Effect"" in two major set-pieces. Though in the first, a car chase, it was black comedy as bodies came thick and fast from the back of a van to be run over by the pursuing cars, the second was pushing the boundaries in a to a more disturbing area.A criticism levied at Michael Bay by British critic Mark Kermode has been that he is a filmmaker with ""pornographic sensibilities"". Not just in the literal sense, but in the way that he views everything from cars, women and explosions for example. But this was no more clearly re- enforced than in a scene about 90 minutes in, when our two 'bad boys' are searching a morgue and after pulling back the sheets on fat white guys, they reveal a large breasted young woman, who is refer to as ""The Bimbo"" if my memory serves. It's worrying because I don't know whether this was being played for laughs or was supposed to be a titillating shot of a well endowed woman? Is it right to show a dead woman, who looks to have been strangled to death and referred to a bimbo in a mainstream 15 certificated movie?I don't want to sound like a prude but the tone of this and pretty much every scene with the bodies being used, seemed to be in plain Bad, BAD taste and though this humour can play well in the right genre of movie, this just simply wasn't the film to do it in, in my opinion. But, that criticism aside, my main issues are the pacing. It was just too hollow to sustain its running time and my mind was beginning to wander from time to time between the spectacular action and the few moments of decent comedy.It just didn't have the magic of the 90′s actioner, a genre which had faded considerably by the early 2000′s, and without offering anything new besides improved action, which was worth the ticket or DVD price in its own right, or even retaining the original character of the original, this was a sequel failed to hold its own.",Bad Boys II
171,kidwltm,A Little Bit Of The Old Ultra-Violence,6,18 July 2003,"Bad Boys II is an action film like they used to make them. Today, it's mostly PG-13 consumer ready products with no balls.  Bad Boys II is full of big explosions, vulgarity, and oddles of blood.  But, that does not essentially make this a great movie.First off, I found Bad Boys II to a better comedy than action film.  This is due mainly to the chemistry of the two main stars, who seem to have genuine chemistry together, unlike most recent buddy teams (I'm looking at you Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker).  Most of their lines were improvised, so a lot of their own humor is evident in the movie.  If you are someone who is critical of Will Smith or Martin Lawrence, you won't find the movie funny. I think they both can be funny, but they are not uproarious.
It seems already that a lot of people are complaining about the violence in this movie.  Seriously, THEY'VE DONE WORSE IN HOLLYWOOD BEFORE.  Critics are scapegoating the film like it's ""Caligula"" or something.  It's not that violent, it's not that disgusting.  Get over it and we'll all be happier people.    That said, I didn't find the action all that great, especially in this summer.  Another car chase, yeah.  Oh wait, you have shootouts as well? Genius!  The action is recycled.  Traditional action movies have worn thin on me.    Bay tries to sparkle it up with his directing, and sometimes it actually works, but it's far from a saving grace.  Action fans will get a kick out of it, but most others will just be tired.Based on the reference above, you may have guessed I'm not too critical on Michael Bay, whose generally held in comtempt by most (a pretty popular bandwagon most ""film buffs"" have jumped on to).   Bay at least tries to do somethings a tad different.  It's not much, and his style can be annoying at times, but this man is  NOT the worst director in Hollywood.
I felt the movie was enjoyable because Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are a good team.  It they carry the movie through the rough spots (and at 2 1/2 hours, there's a lot of them).  The action was alright, but it really started to feel like deja vu by the end of the film.  Bay directing is far from great, but it's not terrible.

I really enjoyed this movie, as I did the first one. Some say that the acting isn't that great. Some say that the plot is predictable, etc. etc.
Well, I have to tell you...Great Action and it had me laughing throughout the movie, and I don't laugh out loud at movies that often. I really got a kick out of the banter between Smith and Lawrence throughout the movie.

173,PlutonicLove,The Evil One has outdone himself this time!,1,22 July 2003,"Before I begin this brief review of Bad Boys II, let me inform you that I am not a prude. I love exploitation films. I love sex and violence. But this movie simply crossed the line. Forget Hershell Gordon Lewis - he was Walt Disney in comparison. Forget all of the grande guignol Italian horror directors of the '70s - their zombie and cannibal movies are like the Teletubbies compared to Michael Bay's latest monsterpiece. Hell, even forget the collected works of Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider and Tom Green.
.this movie..this movie. this movie.This movie will go down in my long years of extensive movie watching as the crassest, most offensive, most bloodthirsty, most repulsive film ever made. Not since the release of the actual Nazi Holocaust footage have I seen so much mindless destruction and heartless killing on screen, fuelled by endless supplies of unbridled hate. Never have two supposed `heroes' caused so much collateral damage for so little reason. The film's supposed `gags' consist of nothing but homophobia, necrophilia, corpse mutilation and seriously offensive ethnic slurs, the punch lines usually resulting in more impersonal unnecessary killing, filmed in that pornographically violent style we've come to expect from Bay. This is violence without consequence - most of the time the movie doesn't even address it (such as the scene where a Hummer crushes dozens of shanties and their inhabitants).
And you know what? It wouldn't even bug me that much if the film had any halfway decent action scenes. Zilch. Bay's direction can only be described as incompetent to the very extreme. To quote Roger Ebert: `The movie is so choppy in its nervous editing that a lot of the time we're simply watching senseless kinetic action. The chase scenes and shoot-outs are broken down into closeups that deny us any sense of the physical relationship of the actors or the strategy of a chase. It's all just movement.'
I had little idea of what was going on during the film's countless chase scenes, or why they were necessary.This movie has officially surpassed Pearl Harbor, Attack of the Clones Batman and Robin and Freddy Got Fingered on my list of worst movies of all time. Congratulations, Michael Bay. After Pearl I didn't think it could get any worse, but you've outdone yourself this time.",Bad Boys II
174,ShimmySnail,"empty, yes, but great fun",8,9 October 2003,"Two Miami cops, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, take on the Cuban/Hatian/Russian ecstasy cartel.  The jokes and buddy squabbling are a bit predictable but still very funny.  The ethnic and necrotic (about the dead) humor gets a bit thick at times, but the stereotypes broken down by two black cops with a white captain (rather than the usual other way around) more than make up for it.  The furious police captain revoking the badges of his best but most irresponsible star officers is still there, for the most part, but Joe Pantoliano is still likable in the role.Okay, it's empty, it's gratuitous, but so is every movie that costs this much, and for a film that's nothing but a thrill ride, this one tops them all.  It has a freeway chase scene at least twice as intense as The Matrix: Reloaded, and according to the director, none of it is CG.  It has an order of magnitude of action more than Black Hawk Down, including, yes, some scenes with a Black Hawk full of Delta Force soldiers.  It's much better than the first Bad Boys, not just in the amount of action but the camera work is all extremely stylized, and when I say extremely, I mean that every shot everywhere has something special about it.  Whirling perspective pan out over several themes, red or blue glows to instrument panels, sweat drenched strip teasers, filthy gangsters counting fistfuls of cash, slow motion water splashing, dissected bullet impacts, drug capsules arcing through the air, beautiful panoramas of beach front manors.  The editing alone probably cost more than most movies' entire budgets.",Bad Boys II
175,fidelio74,2003: 'Year of the Car Chase',8,14 November 2010,"I think it was Empire that called 2003 'Year of the car chase', a reference to the vehicular carnage on offer in four of the films released that year - 'Bad Boys II', 'The Matrix Reloaded', 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines', and '2Fast 2Furious'. For my money, the best one was the spectacular smash up of the 'The Matrix' sequel.'Bad Boys II' is incredibly entertaining. Once again, the visuals are stunning and highly stylized, and the action is breathtaking and nonstop. The movie offers up two killer car chases, the first of which takes place along the Macarthur Freeway in Miami, Florida where the film is set.In this second installment in the 'Bad Boys' franchise, Detectives Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) investigate the Ecstasy flow into Miami. In doing so, they tangle with evil drug baron Hector Juan Carlos 'Johnny' Tapia (Jordi Molla). And relations betwixt the two detectives become strained when it emerges that Mike has been seeing Marcus' sister Syd (Gabrielle Union).In addition to the two car chases, we also get a thrilling shootout at a drug dealer's decrepit house. The second car chase takes place in Cuba and includes a truly spectacular sequence in which a yellow Hummer occupied by the two detectives and Syd races downhill through a shantytown. A number of the closely bunched together shacks are drug factories employing highly flammable materials, so many of them explode as the Humvee smashes through them. The whole thing looks incredibly dangerous and, knowing director Michael Bay, WAS extremely dangerous! Bay has a cameo as a motorist ('Freak!') wearing a rather silly hat, as does retired American quarterback Dan Marino; he plays a man test driving a car which Marcus and Mike 'borrow' for use in a car chase.In the film's opening shootout, a bullet fired from the gun of Detective Lowrey passes through a rather intimate part of his partner's anatomy on its way to neutralise a bad guy. The subsequent injury to Detective Burnett's nether regions is a source of much of the film's ensuing comedy. Like the first film, 'Bad Boys II' is very funny, and there is real chemistry betwixt the two leads. Joe Pantoliano is great fun again as the long-suffering Captain Howard, who is convinced that Mike and Marcus deliberately go out of their way to make his life miserable.If you are looking for more bang for your buck, then this film delivers in spades. It is very long but never really drags as it is very well-paced. Bay regular Peter Stormare ('Armageddon') pops up as Alexei, and Theresa Randle reprises her role of Theresa, Marcus' wife.Whether we will see a 'Bad Boys III' remains to be seen. But, if it is anything like the first two films, then bring it on!",Bad Boys II
176,chucknorrisrules,"One of the stupidest, loudest, and most fun movies to date",9,9 June 2008,"I've seen both Bad Boys and Bad Boys II, but hadn't seen Bad Boys II until after I saw Hot Fuzz (where it had been referred to many times by Danny Butterman - played by Nick Frost - who thought that police work is all-out action like the movies), so I decided to take a look.Personally, I don't understand why critics ripped it up in their reviews. Perhaps critics' opinions are different to how good the movie actually is (see my review of Distant Voices Still Lives). Will Smith and Martin Lawrence as well as being brilliant action heroes, are also a brilliant comedy duo in the Bad Boys movies. (The scene in the mortuary when martin Lawrence chooses his hiding place is pushing it a little, but that's my only complaint.) The movie is ridiculous, but that simply adds to the fun and the humour in it. The end fight in Cuba is probably the loudest and fastest in the entire movie, and also the most exciting by far. The film delivers, and the characters are great characters whom you actually care about.I would recommend this movie. If you haven't seen it, buy the DVD and watch it! NOW!!",Bad Boys II

The banter between them is flat and drab. Profanity isn't really a big deal, but even I got sick of hearing them swear at everything.This movie is guilty of something that is the death of an action comedy. It's boring. They should have decided which direction they wanted, dead bodies or lively comedy. The dreadful patter interrupts the action scenes and sucks any life out of them (although they're shockingly overblown and bad anyway), and because this is a tough guy movie the lines are awful.

The light repartee between Smith and Lawrence that made the original such fun has been replaced with something resembling the carping of an old married couple. Smith does his best with the material handed him and still has occasional flashes of charm, but Lawrence has sunk entirely into the persona of a spinster aunt.  This is not just a movie where you have to suspend disbelief; you have to disconnect your mind entirely. The people behind me were engaged in a long conversation for entire the second half of the movie--something that always annoys me terribly, but in this case I didn't complain because I really couldn't blame them--and their conversation was more interesting than the movie anyway.

189,callaway76,Michael Bay - America's answer to John Woo?,7,18 July 2003,"I remember reading somewhere that Michael Bay got his start as a kid when he used to blow up his toys and take pictures of it. Since then he has taken this inner ambition and excelled to become one of the greatest Action Directors of our time in only 8 years.Let's get the negative out of the way. Bay still has trouble directing actors when they aren't blowing things up. Parts of this movie almost left you queezy due to horrible dialogue editing and the film's lack of patience for the actors to do their job. It felt like Bay just told the actors to rush their scenes so we could get on to the action.That said.This movie was incredible. Michael Bay is the Charlie Parker of Action sequences. He is a true artist. He carries the special ability to simotaneously raise the pulse (and testostarone level) of the entire audience at once, and he doesn't just give you a little dose at a time. As soon as one bullet is fired (at the Haitiian House for example) the action starts and continues to grow, like a brush fire. Perhaps Bay is an extremist, but that is the way of the Action Movie Director. Whatever excitement he can cram in there, he does, and he does it well, very well. I remember seeing a glimpse of the Haitiian house shoot out a year ago in the preview, it gave me chills. Now that I have witnessed the entire scene, I realize Michael Bay truly has a gift.The Criterion Collection (who also re-released John Woo's 'The Killer' and 'Hard Boiled') has caught on to Bay's genius and there's no wonder why. Bay's imagination and execution are nothing short of pure art. Don't expect life lessons or a journey through human emotions in this movie. Expect extreme action, explosions, bullets and a car chase that easily rivals the one in 'The Matrix: Reloaded'.Michael Bay has come a long way from the orginal 'Bad Boys' only in the sense that Hollywood has learned to give this man a larger budget. I fear he will never stop making movies until he has run out of things to blow up, let's hope America doesn't do this job for him first.",Bad Boys II

One, the police captain (Joe Pantoliano, wearing a flattering flat-top wig that cuts a decade off his age) whose office is a repository of Buddhist imagery and who tries valiantly to contend calmly with the chaos his messiest cops inflict upon the world. At this he fails, and the attempt is funny. Pantoliano always leaves an impression - who can forget his recurring role in ""The Sopranos?"" - and the movie profits from his presence. The other humor is reiterative patter between the stars, comic Martin Lawrence, playing wary Marcus, who is in therapy and chants a pat mantra to ease him into a zone of acceptance when he is about ready to explode, or implode; and his life-long buddy, boys together, live or die together, something like that in their school year-book, Mike (Will Smith), who gets his charge out of risk-taking.

And the action is way more violent & entertaining than the first one, going way over the top, which in these day and age what isn't. It had all the things set right to better than the first one, but it didn't follow it's story as well as the first one. The bad guy who is extremely eviler than Noah on part I, isn't shown that much.

193,beatnick49,Bad Boys? Very bad movie!,1,18 January 2004,"Warning, contains numerous spoilersI didn't go in with high expectations of this, being made eight years after the original and originally unplanned for sure (these factors are often signs that a sequel will stink, I didn't see the Carrie sequel but all the reviews told me everything I needed to know). I really only went to see this because friends got me to. What made the original good was lacking in this effort, in terms of originality, characters, plot, length, and in terms of good or bad taste.While the original was just another mismatched pair of cops it didn't have all that tacky street talk, while there was some it wasn't to the annoying extent that it was in say Shaft or Training Day. There was genuine humour and the action was in healthy doses. The length was good at 114 minutes (just under two hours). And there was somewhat a degree of originality with the setting (a change from New York or Los Angeles) and even the villains where not your cliched Hispanic or Homie gangs.This however loses everything. The characters are just plain unlikeable, with Martin Lawrence continually trying to dominate his sister, and then getting angry at Smith's character for dating her, and then taking his overprotection home and tormenting his daughter's date, I didn't really find that funny. I wanted to smash his characters face in for his attempted dominance (and for the record I am not a downtrodden sibling, I just found his antics so annoying). Will Smiths character has none of the attributes in the last one, he's quick to anger, and has a bad attitude as displayed when he referred to a corpse as a bimbo (which means promiscuous), when for all he knew she could have been an Honours student.The treatment of corpses in this is in bad taste. The scene in the morgue (which is where Smith insults the corpse) was disgusting, with organs and brains being shown. This made me feel bad in the toes. Sure there was blood and gore in movies such as Saving Private Ryan and From Hell but that's because, SVP and movies like it used gore to show how horrible wars are, and From Hell dealt with themes of the body and medical procedures.
In the original, when Lowrey and Burnette (the main characters) had a spat (often faked) it was quick, and amusing. In this the spats are long, drawn out, deliberate, and just laced with spite mostly on the part of Lawrences character. I felt particularly uncomfortable watching the scene when they were walking through the fences. This is an action-comedy, spite between chararcters is edging into drama territory. Lets keep action comedy, action comedy. The originality is lacking too. In the original, rather than the usual Hispanics, Rastafarians or homies, the villains were locals led by a European. In this the main villian is a Hispanic, and has dealings with the Russian mafia, very cliched these days.The last half hour is the worst, it is where the movie bcomes too long, just plain ridiculous, and the cliches continue. When Delta Force and that anti-Castro militia came in I thought ""You are joking"" unfortunately they weren't. Bringing the other two groups in and the fact that Joe Pantoliano's character knew someone from one of them was ludicrous. When Burnetts sister is kidnapped by the token hispanic drug dealer, she's taken to Cuba; Castro is involved in the drug trade and gives protection to drug lords, the token Latin American dictator. This is veering into Swachzenegger, Van Damme, and Segal territory. In the original the characters did not come out of the final fight scene unscathed, the characters were pinned down and only freed thanks to Tea Leoni, Burnett took a bullet to the leg, Lowrey took a hefty punch in the face and was thrown from a moving car and couldn't get up without help, and Ruiz and Sanchez would have been killed if not for the intervention of Lowrey. In this the characters with their militray and para-military allies get through without any trouble, only one member gets a bullet in the shoulder and even some members of the Cuban army are popped off. If they do Bad Boys 3 will they go to the Middle East and fight Saddam Hussein loyalists? How Will Smith could oppose the war in Iraq (for which I will always like him for) and yet star in such cliched material, I will never know.Then there is the chase through the shanty town which is a complete rip off from the Jackie Chan movie Police Story. Joe Pantoliano played the cliched role of the stressed out superior officer in the original with such genuine humour I didn't mind. In this he tried far too hard in this to pul it off, it seemed too forced. There was nothing to save this movie. There was the freeway chase scene, but thats hardly a redeeming factor. Smith takes up acting in cliched material ending his record of descent movies (that I've seen at least), while Lawrence continues his record of lousy movies, except for the original Bad Boys which is great and Blue Streak which is quite amusing. But otherwise, is pretty bad.Big lack of originality, Bad taste, Bad characters, Bad movie. Avoid it if you can...like the plague",Bad Boys II
194,petep,"Extremely violent, but still quite entertaining...",10,29 August 2003,"Contains PLOT SPOILERS, but nothing major.Bad Boys II is not a movie about a couple of cops.  Sure, that's their ""profession.""  They have a captain that yells at them when they cause too much property damage.  They are supposed to have search warrants.  But I wouldn't think that cops ever work like this.  Racing down a highway, causing the destruction of 22 cars and a boat?  Taking a helicopter, along with a lot of serious weaponry, into Latin America to save someone's sister with a small war?  Oh wait, that's all irrelevant, cause they're bad cops anyway (no pun intended).  I mean, they typically don't come away with any evidence until the inevitable small war at the end of a case.  They're known by their peers on the force for being crazy.  OK, plot holes explained.Wow, I really loved this movie.  I mean, I've been anticipating it more than any movie this summer except Matrix Reloaded, but it was still better than anticipated -- an attribute I am always quite pleased to find out.  Are there racist and homophobic jokes?  Yes, but who cares?  They were funny, and we know the filmmakers wouldn't deliberately offend anyone.  Is the film violent?  Yes, and extremely so I must warn, probably moreso than any recent movie.  Be warned about a few corpses that get dropped onto the road during a car chase.  A lot of this violence surprised me in its nature, which is rare, so please be warned.But you know, maybe director Michael Bay is doing us a favor by showing us, under the disguise of a violent movie that is supposed to have all the typical blood and explosions of a summer flick, how some violent acts would really happen.  I mean, if someone is struggling off the side of a car door, while the car is driving up a narrow circling ramp, they might hit a column. If a bomb goes off right in the middle of several people, they will go flying in every direction.  If someone falls flat on their back, due to a mortal wound, in the middle of a mine field, they will probably set off some explosions.  Ok, I'm messing around here a bit with my ""rationalizations."" In truth, Bay probably just kept things so violent because he could.  The R-rated version of Pearl Harbor wasn't shown in theaters.  But the shock value made these quite exciting and amusing action scenes in Bad Boys II really effective.How about Will Smith and Martin Lawrence?  I found them quite amusing, contrary to what many others will hear.  Hopefully this will make some people forget about more recent duds from them (Men in Black II, Black Knight).  By the way, the spanish house blown up towards the end was real. Bruckheimer bought it from people looking for it to be demolished.  And the corpses?  Apparently they were real.  Disturbing.  So for my personal enjoyment, I'd definitely give this flick a 10/10.  Since I can handle the excessive violence, I really enjoyed all the thrills.  Awesome car chases. Great shootouts.  Some really funny parts as well.  If I had to be objective, I'd probably say 5/10, but like I do with films such as The Phantom Menace and Lethal Weapon 4, I shall try to put objectivity aside.",Bad Boys II

196,charliegeeza,"This movie is bad, and unfortunately I mean that literally",4,6 October 2003,"The first movie was brilliant.  Everything was done right.  Given that it was the same strong cast and production team, what I expected was more of the same.  What I saw was everything done wrong.In the first Bad Boys, the ""bad boy"" attitude was tempered with an implicit understanding between the two lead characters.  In this sequel there is no understanding, just lots of stupid, unnecessary bad attitude.  They just swear at each other.  In fact, I can't remember any dialog other than Mike (Will Smith) and Marcus (Martin Lawrence) swearing at each other.  Every comment is met by a poor quip or a swear word.  That's just not entertaining.  There was none of the chemistry between the two leads that was oozing out of the original.Then there's the awful plot.  A war between five factions (Jamaicans, Russians, Cubans, the Miami PD and the DEA) basically rages on the streets of Miami.  We are expected to believe that, despite the ridiculous carnage, nobody other than bad guys and cops gets to die.  And we are expected to believe that the vigilante maverick behaviour of the two leads is only punished by - you can guess - swearing and yet more swearing.One of the subtle sides of making a good cop movie is that the leads have to behave like cops.  Police have to operate within certain boundaries. Those boundaries can only be pushed when needs be - something the original movie pulled off with finesse.  Sadly, all this movie contains is senseless violence, leaving the viewer with no sense of escapism.Another subtle side of making a good cop movie is to build a relationship up between the viewer and the lead characters to the extent that you, the viewer, really want them to win any situation.  In this sense, a strong point of the original movie was the focus on the lifestyles of Mike and Marcus, with a constant comparison between the two.  However, this time around the appearance of Marcus' wife can only be described as cameo and the only thing you know of Mike is that he's dating Marcus' sister.  So, unless you watch the first movie immediately before the second, you share no empathy with the lead characters and as such you don't really root for them when it comes to the constant gun battles and car chases.  In fact, given how annoying some of their dialog is, you almost find yourself willing the bad guys to win just to shut them up.I could go on and on and on about the bad aspects of Bad Boys 2.  There are awful continuity errors - for instance how does an articulated lorry instantly catch a 4x4 that has a 30s head start?  Not even Will Smith's presence could add to this movie, his character is just that poorly represented in the script.  The screenplay is jumpy, inconsistent, and utterly unbelievable - everything that you don't want from a cop movie.To be fair, there is some great action with the car chases and slow motion effects - y'know, the 'oh ah' moments that are supposed to supplement a good movie.  You're left feeling the reverse - that the dialog and storyline are simply supplements to the action in this movie, merely serving to give the violence some form of context.  In fact, the only notable parts of the screenplay are the references to the original (the slow spinning camera angle and the, ""From now on, that's how you..."").  If you switch your brain off for 2 and a half hours, you're sure to have a laugh.  Personally, I expect a little more than big explosions out of a movie.The original Bad Boys was Michael Bay at his brilliant best.  This sequel is Michael Bay at his woeful worst.  This movie is bad, and unfortunately I mean that literally - 4/10 for me and all 4 of those marks are for the action.  Another entry into the bulging  ""could and should have been great"" category given the excellence of the original, without the reputation of which this movie surely would have bombed at the box office.",Bad Boys II
197,ian959,"Purgatory, pure purgatory",4,11 June 2004,"Having thoroughly enjoyed the original film so much, maybe it was just my expectations were too high for this eventual sequel. Or maybe it simply is that bad. All the things that made Bad Boys an enjoyable, if not exactly a classic, film simply got lost as Michael Bay proceeded to prove that he is what I suspected all along: completely talentless.  Simple things like plot are simply forgotten as the film lurches from effects pastiche to effects pastiche, with increasing incredulity. Whilst the effects at least provide something nearly-worthwhile to watch, the whole film simply ends up being two hours of pure purgatory, like watching a bickering, married couple who don't know when it is time to quit and get a divorce.  Avoidable on just about every level.",Bad Boys II
198,stamp1,FUNNY! NON-STOP ACTION! TONS OF GORE :(!,8,10 September 2003,"I kept laughing a lot, which was good, because there were some scenes that made me sorta sick to my stomach. When Martin Lawrence threw-up, I felt the same way!! I jumped out of my seat when the dead bodies were falling in the streets and the cars ran over them!! (And when the heads Fell Off!!!) And the dripping blood scene!! Was this an action film, a comedy movie, or a gory horror movie????The action was almost non-stop! The car chase scenes were UNBELIEVABLE!!!! This has really been a good year for car chase movies, with ""Matrix 2: Reloaded"", ""Cradle 2 The Grave"", ""Spy Kids 3D"", ""Terminator 3"", ""The Recruit"", ""The Italian Job"", ""Lara Croft 2"", ""LXG"", and ""2 Fast 2 Furious"". Did I miss any?, there were so many this year! But the car chases in BB2 made the ""Matrix 2"" chases seem almost boring. The only comparably great ones were, I think, the ones in ""Terminator 3"" and ""2 Fast 2 Furious"". Gun shoots-outs everywhere you looked!!! So many dead bodies!! I enjoyed the dead Cubans in Cuba the most! Yea! Dead Commies! But.. so much blood!! A Vampire would LOVE this film!! (If you are a Vampire, then be sure to see it!)The comedy was really hilarious! I especially liked the 15 yr. old boy trying to date the teen girl!, the heart-to-heart talk in the electronics store!, and the effect of ecxtasy on Martin Lawrence and his body part!!! The scene with police captain Joe Pantoliano having a fit in his office was really funny, AND THEN I COULDN'T STOP LAUGHING WHEN HE WAS SCREAMING ABOUT ALL THE DEAD BODIES FROM THE MORGUE IN THE BANK LOBBY AND IN THE STREETS, AND THEN he asks Will Smith if he was into kidnapping too. It was just too funny!!Movie Philosophy: Kill as many people as possible, as fast as possible, as funny as possible, while grossing out the audience AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE! AND destroy 1 MILLION+ cars and trucks while you're at it! And an entire shantytown to boot!If it hadn't been so gory, I would have given it a 10/10 for excitement and action and comedy! But I just gave it an 8/10 for grossing me out!",Bad Boys II

It was a good movie but it was a bit long.  But then some of what was going on would not have been portrayed if shorten in length ...then some of you would say it was a bad movie well I am not a film critic nor do I listen to them...I really liked the extra DVD stuff on the filming of the car crashes and the drive through shanty town.. makes you more aware of what goes into it and some insight into movie making...As far as the language ...its nothing more than you would hear everyday.

200,DarkLugia1969,Bad Boys 4 Life,10,8 August 2003,"-Note:  May contain spoilers so you have been warned-    To the Late Mr. Simpson and Mr. Bruckheimer who have waited eight years to bring back Martin Lawrence and Will Smith.  After seeing this film it was well worth the weight.  Michael Bay created this wonderful masterpiece. Non-stop action that gets right into your face very hard.  This is how an action movie should be made. Mr. Lawrence and Mr. Smith are at it again as loose-cannon narcotics cops in the city of Miami that try to stop a Cuban drug lord from making the biggest drug run ever to hit the city of Miami.  The two do an excellent job in meshing well with each others antics.  Especially the first few minutes with the drug ""bust"" at a KKK rally and it continues on until the end of the movie.   Garielle Union who's Mr. Smith loves interest in the movie does an excellent job and is slowly becoming one of the latest and hottest actresses to grace the movie screen.      Depending on how well this movie does in the box office and the schedule for both Will Smith and Martin Lawrence there will be a possible Bad Boys 3. Let hope it doesn't be another eight years to see that movie.The Dark Gengar gives this excellent movie from one Gengar to Ten Gengars: A very rare Ten Gengars.  This movie soundtrack is better than the first movie soundtrack.  Enjoy the movies folks.",Bad Boys II
201,pailoong,The Chemistry Saves It,10,3 August 2016,"If any other actors played the leads in this movie, it would probably be just another style-over- substance, buddy cop action film to waste time on during the summer or on a night when you're bored. However, the chemistry between Will Smith and Martin Lawrence and their skills in playing off of each other elevate this film into a fun adventure. If you don't believe me, watch the scene when Reggie shows up to take Marcus's daughter out on a first date and he and Mike mess with him. I honestly can't tell if it was scripted or if it was just Martin and Will playing off of each other and ad-libbing, but these two make the Bad Boys films.Outside of this, it's your typical Michael Bay film: lots of action, stylized camera shots, sexy girls, some refreshingly non-PC racial humor, and some of the strangest editing you'll ever see when it comes to dialogue. It seems like the scenes cut right when there was supposed to be more said between two characters and the result is this odd, unfinished feeling during certain scenes. It's unnerving in some places!A fun film to watch, but not exactly ""Citizen Kane"" (nor is it meant to be).",Bad Boys II
202,r0cko723,The Michael Bay Amp is turned up to eleven on this one.,8,10 February 2020,"I have to laugh at critics whose delicate sensibilities are offended by the Michael Bay approach to action film making. Bay does this genre the Bay way. It's expensive, loud, visual, and visceral. It doesn't skimp on effects and detonations. There will be collateral damage, usually massive property carnage. There will be no doubt about the status of the villain(s). Same for the good guys. Same for their cause, whatever it might be. Slow-mo will be applied liberally for effect, when extra doses of effect are desired. Explosions? Bullets? Bazookas? Well, it goes without saying. In Bad Boys II, Michael Bay applies his wares to great effect. He Michael-Bayed the daylights out of this movie. He came, he saw, he Michael-Bayed. And it was fun.",Bad Boys II
203,VenomX,A surpringly good action flick with some flaws,6,7 March 2004,"I have never been a big fan of Michael Bay, personally I have a love/hate relationship with his works.  Bad Boys was pretty good, The Rock I didn't like, Armageddon was watch-able and Pearl Harbour bored me to disinterest. It wasn't until I witnessed McG's disaster films that I began to pity Bay a bit, at least he puts forth the effort to make entertaining summer films.I haven't seen the original Bad Boys in years now, but I still recall what great chemistry Smith and Lawrence had on the screen.  Smith has improved a lot in terms of acting ability since 1995 while Lawrence has had some modest success.  Bad Boys 2 succeeds, stumbles and fails at some parts of the film. The first half of the film succeeds, the causeway chase is seriously on my Top 10 car chase list.  I always found stunt drivers and pyrotechnics is so much better at creating tension than watching a CGI figure jump on cars.  It stumbles around the end because the film just feels like it was stretched a half-hour too long, with too many breaks between action scenes with plot (which has never been a Bay strength).  By the end, the film feels exhausted and like it ran out of ideas or scenes to create.This is a part that I'm going to write a separate paragraph for due to the attention it's getting.  I'm sure you've heard about the ""bad taste"" humour this film has.  There is a line that exists between dark humour and poor taste, this line is in different places for different people and with some there is no line.  In my case, I felt a little disgusted when Smith was reaching into a dead body for drugs but felt really nothing when Smith & Lawrence were ""interrogating"" the latter's date with a gun.  Like I said, the line is usually there and your tastes will guide you in finding that line.Otherwise, the film is standard Bay stuff: big action, large explosions, non-existant plot and star power.  In Bad Boys 2 an equilibrium is discovered that makes it all worthwhile.6.5/10",Bad Boys II

The action was fast, but the realism of the movie was not believable. Way too many close calls, the way action movies usually are.The comedy gets an A+ in my book. So far, this is the funniest movie I've seen of the year. There was A LOT of comedy, note that I stress the words, ""a lot."" I was laughing from start to finish. Very few lines were weak, but there not noticeable.Overall, this is the perfect film if you want to sit back, watch some people die, and laugh your ass off. You didn't need to see the first one to understand the story, so don't worry. But I do advise you, it was a very gory movie.

Every time they try to catch him they couldn't because he would sue them because they couldn't find proof he was a drug dealer. Marcus and Mike were the only persons that could catch him. In the end Mike and Marcus catch Johnny in Cuba.The best thing about the movie is that it is HILARIOUS and nobody in the good guys side dies. The actors did a very good job on acting.

208,TomPaine-3,I must have been drunk too see this...,1,5 October 2003,"Here's a quick-fire summary of my views of this alleged film - homophobic, xenophobic, misogynistic and deeply, deeply disturbing.Deeply disturbing in the fact that there is no level to which Michael Bay and his writers will not stoop in order to gain either a cheap laugh or a funny murder. How does necrophilia sound to you? Or having your brain fried with Ecstacy? Or intimidating an innocent lad just because he's coming to take his daughter out on a date? Make you laugh. Ha, ha, ha.How about comedy Russians or Haitians? How bulldozing a Cuban shanty town to the ground with innocent people inside those houses - still what's a dead Cuban to director Bay. Still laughing.There are several things to dislike this movie. Is it only foreign types who import drugs into the US? Judging by this, the answer is yes. What's makes this film the most disturbing I've seen in a long while is that Cuba and anti-Castro terrorism is used as a plot device.SPOILER ALERT (not that this film need spoiling) - In one of several false endings, our gang go to Cuba with help from a group called Alpha 7. Here's a quick history lesson, the Alpha 7 is based on a real group called Omega 7, who are a bunch of nasty right-wing anti-Castro terrorists based in Miami. Far from the underground freedom fighters as portrayed in this film, the real Omega 7 have tried to destabilised Cuba and Castro through terrorism such as introducing Dengue fever into Cuba in the early 1980's which killed at least 113 Cuban civilians and a spate of bombings in Havana hotels in the late 1990's and alienated those Cuban exiles who want to seek a detente with the Cuban government.The introduction of this element into the plot, implys that Castro and Cuba are involved in Ecstacy drug-running into the US, something I suspect that is further from the truth. In turn this film turns quickly from a nasty, little action flick into a right-wing, militarist, anti-castro fan-boy fantasy, giving the people who see this film the impression that what America is doing to Cuba is right. Did the actors read the script they were given. But I forget this is a Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay film. When you are signed up to one of their films, check your critical faculties into the bank along with the fat pay-check you've been given. If you want to see what Cuba is really about go check out some Cuban solidarity web-sites and not have your opinions warped by a tenth-rate film-maker like BayFinally, this film should finally give credence to the fact that Martin Lawrence is untalented, which is evident to most people, except to film executives with their eyes on the box-office returns. Will Smith is undoubtedly a talent, which why he chose this film remains a mystery to me or to anyone who saw what he could do in a serious role such as 'ALI'. No-ones career will be hurt by this film, which is a shame because there are lots of careers of people of people involved with this project who deserve to go down the tubes.My rating 1 out of 10 (Zero out of 10 had I been given the option)",Bad Boys II

Speaking of story, there was just too much.  The whole therapy angle was silly.  ""Woo-sa"" this!  I bet no one's going to pay $8.50 to see Martin Lawrence and Will Smith deal with their emotional problems like a couple of babies.Dr. Dre did some music for the movie.  This man, while a good rapper, shouldn't be allowed to work on movies.  Especially if he's going to put the same redundant baseline in every chance he gets.Back in 1995, they didn't try to be cool with it.  They just did it their own way and it came out great.  Here, you get your standard deal of slow-motion shots, unnecessary explosions, and lotsa people shooting.  But at what?  Most bullets go through walls just for the sake of firing a gun.I feel the same way about this movie as I did on HULK and TOMB RAIDER. The filmmakers know how to film action but that doesn't mean anything if you throw in a whole bunch of nonsense as your story.After BAD BOYS II is over, you're going to say, ""If it were shorter, it would've been better.""  You'd be right in saying that.  Instead of seeing this pretty typical summer movie, go rent BAD BOYS.  Better yet, buy the special edition DVD.4/10",Bad Boys II
211,devinshee,One Of The Best Action Movies Ever!,9,10 September 2007,"I think Bad Boys 2 is one of the best action movies ever. I really like Michael Bay movies, he does really cool action movies, and i like his style. And of course Martin Laurence and Will Smith are good and have chemistry, just like in the original one, and they kind of act just like they did in the original one a little bit, which is good. Let me set it straight. The first Bad Boys movie is pretty much better at the comedy and humor and i guess the story too. And Bad Boys 2 is better at the action. Yes, Bad Boys 2 does have its funny moments, but it had so much action, there was not too much comedy, but as i said it did have some pretty funny moments. Bad Boys 2 did have quite a bit of seriousness to it, which i kind of liked, and it was a little serious during the action scenes, which kind of made the action scenes better. I like how Laurence and Smith blabber at each other during the action. The story in Bad Boys 2 isn't all that great, but its okay. It has a very simple storyline, they are trying to stop a drug kingpin, and all that stuff between Martin Laurences sister in the movie. I loved the action in the movie. I think it is one of the best action movies ever. Lots of stuff gets blown up real good, Michael Bay sure knows how the blow stuff up. I like all the shooting and explosions and shootouts. The first car chase in the movie is great, when they are chasing the Haitians and throwing cars off the car carrier, that was a long car chase, and there is a cool shootout in the middle of the car chase. Tree's, the ground, dirt, cars, Stepals, bushes, mansions, high rises, etc. all get shot up and blown up The movie is a big battleground. The action scenes are very epic and long, so its very detailed on things getting blown up and shot up. The movie is very violent, bloody, and gory. Like that scene at the end in the Mindfield. And there's a scene were dead bodies are being run over. The good old days, when action movies were rated R, and lots of explosions and stuff. And lots of bad words. And no cops get in the way with Martin Laurence and Will Smith which is cool, no getting in trouble, not letting cops get in the way of the cool destructive action. Just action, action, action I love the style of the action. Also, i really liked the music in the movie, especially during the action scenes. It made the actions scenes more intense and gets your blood pumping. And the ending action scene in Cuba at the end of the movie is very pleasing. Yes, the movie may be pretty mean spirited, and pointless and relentless, but it is awesome. Michael Bay is almost like John Woo. This movie is a fun, wild, crazy, loud, action packed ride. Its one of the most action packed movies ever.",Bad Boys II
212,smorris200,Exactly What it says on the tin,8,19 April 2004,"I liked this Movie a lot.  It has humour and some great action sequences.  A reasonably complex plot and lots of laughs and explosions.  What more could one want from a film like this.  The car chase with the car transporter was on a par with those in Matrix reloaded and T3 and there is a lot more than that.  I liked the banter between Will Smith and Martin Lawrence and just generally watched the whole film with a big smile. It is not going to win any oscars and it does not make my top 10 movies, but I did like it and admired the scale of it all.

The only two problems I have with Bad Boys 2 is the opening. I couldn't understand who or what was going on. Also the slow motion sequence with the gun being fired is so lame. That ruined the movie for me. Even though Bad Boys 2 is not as superior as the first one, it does deliver the laughs, hardcore action, and great performances.",Bad Boys II
214,nightstrife,Atrocious. The worst movie I've seen - ever.,1,17 January 2007,"This movie was absolutely terrible.Why? Well, first, let me say it was poorly written. It felt like it went for five hours, and when I thought it was over, somehow, the incompetent police let the bad guys escape with the girl. These are the same group of police who trashed Miami and gunned down many, many people on several occasions and still had their jobs at the end of the day. This is not fun. This is stupid.The use of the ""f"" word is usually to ADD to a script, it's not half of the entire script. There are too many skits which aren't FUNNY. Laughing at a female cadaver isn't funny. It merely highlights the sloppy script.Implausibility is the name of the day here - nothing makes any sense. There is no logic. The film has a strong smell of ""anti-drug"" propaganda which pervades it like a hooker's funk. This foul stench goes through every aspect of the film. They even repeat jokes which weren't funny the first time. So you can't remember the words to ""Bad Boys"" (the song), so what? Go and make real movies, you punks.Michael Bay likes to use really fast camera shots to make the action more interesting than it is. It doesn't work. Will Smith's character is extremely arrogant, and he seriously needs some acting lessons by the way he plays his part, it looks like he ad-libs the script and knocks over props, whereas Lawrence's character has had enough (probably of the franchise) and wants out. I don't blame him. I don't blame anyone for not wanting to be a part of this disaster.Action movies do not come any more costly than this movie - it went into incredible special effects which were just for eye candy and were mind-numbingly dull. Over the top, BORING car-chase scenes which feel like they take up hours of your time will ruin your day. The gun-fights are ludicrous - the heroes (not one of the main characters, mind you) will get shot once in the leg or something while all the bad-guys get nailed.Haven't we seen this before? Oh, yes, in every single other action film. The movie is a complete rip-off of every other better action movie ever made (name one). Bay has even re-used some of the terrible story in The Island, which, for my money, was MILES ahead of this garbage. Bad Boys 2 is utterly derivative and all traces of it should be wiped from our history. Just think - in millions of years, if somebody finds this planet and find traces of this movie, they'll think that we humans never amounted to anything but mindless violence and poor dialogue and a movie that should've ended half an hour before it did.This bloody movie has reignited my anger disorder. I hate it more than words can describe.To sum up - do NOT watch this film if you have ANY self-respect. It is a blemish, not only on films, but on society as a whole. HORRIBLE. -10/10 stars - worse than ANYTHING ELSE - EVER. Having one's fingernails removed with pliers is like a party game compared to this rubbish. Unfortunately, I have to rate it 1 on this site, as it doesn't have negative numbers in its rating scale.",Bad Boys II

All the action, clever chatter, stunts, explosions and buddy-cop movie standards that made the first one great are here again.Martin Lawrence and Will Smith make a fantastic team playing off each other with comic perfection in a big budget, action-packed, fast-paced blockbuster. Gabrielle Union was a great addition to the ensemble, the story-line and the inter-play between Martin and Will also.My only complaint is that we didn't get to see enough of Joe Pantoliano as the Captain.A solid 8 in my books.But that's just my 2 scents. ;)",Bad Boys II
216,duffyboy666,Move over Pearl Harbour because Michael Bay has now truly out mastered himself in sheer badness.,1,27 February 2006,"I don't think this side of In the Mix, Monster A Go Go, Red Zone Cuba and Gigli have I seen a movie quite as stunningly, magnificently awful as Bad Boys 2. Oh sure there's been stinkers like Alone in the dark and In The Mix but Jesus holy Harold Christ in a sidecar this was horrendous, even if it was just because it's plain stupid and grotesque.Bad Boys II is directed by the same complete and utter scumbag who directed Pearl Harbour and Armageddon, Michael Bay. Let me give you a sample of Bay's ""work"". Endless blowing s**t up, killing people for a laugh, no shot lasting for more than 5 seconds, plot that warbles out of control, and of course, the characters looking stupid.In order to get an example of why Bad Boys 2 is so appalling, we need to look at why Bad Boys 1 was for the most part good. Despite having a thin plot and lots of over the top action, Bad Boys 1 was still passable as at least a good rental. It didn't try to be anything that it wasn't and at least the two main characters (Smith and Larwence) stayed in their funny comedy character, as well as playing the serious parts.And that's what upsets me most about this hateful mess. The fact that that WS & ML, two people that I have always respected and enjoyed on stage, have had their characters completely and utterly bastardised. Will Smith who is always capable of entertaining without foul language (Example: Bel Air), has been reduced to not only swearing more than a Glasgow Docker, but also endlessly saying the N word (which might I add he appears afraid to use). And Larwence who can not only entertain but play serious roles with finesse (Example: Blue Streak), is reduced to a boring drone.But of course the actual representation of each character is the least of the paid cinema customer's worry. You see when Michael Bay decides to commission a scene involving death, he explores it in any way possible, in such a grotesque fashion that you'd think he actually enjoys seeing people die. Here's a couple of things that Bay thinks are appropriate for such a film.1) An entire hillside village of Cubans are wiped out just so our heroes can poke fun at the carnage.2) Naked corpses being leered at for sexual gratification. Fun.3) More corpses tossed onto the highway during a car chase.OK, Now that Bay has beaten you to death, it's time for him to show you what he feels about sex.1) Two rats screwing in an attic as Bay's camera lingers on what he's sure is a brilliantly conceived sight gag! 2) A 15-year-old boy threatened with a handgun as he's offered anal sex from the movie's hero.And of course that camera angles. Slow motion shots of bullets, areal shots that make nothing out, and of course, Will Smith and Martin Larwence endlessly mugging the camera for the entire TWO AND A HALF FREAKIN HOURS. Yes folks, this painful experience was edited to last two and a half hours, explaining the dreadful editing jobs and slow motion crap.Ladies and Gentleman, Bay has not only matched his average of vile content such as in Pearl Harbour and Armageddon, he's trebled it! There truly isn't a film quite like Bad Boys II. The fact that any paid audience would opt to suffer through two and a half hours of this disaster defies belief.Michael Bay, Duffyboy salutes you, you are one evil bastard.Don't watch this film.",Bad Boys II
217,f_mckissack,Bad Boy Bay,2,13 August 2009,"Bigger, badder, and worse than a tetanus shot in the eye. It is obvious that Michael Bay has no concept of subtlety, but this film goes too far, bordering on bad taste at every turn.And then Will Smith and Martin Lawrence show up spouting one liners straight from the tattered rulebook of bad 80s cop films. They're partners with issues of trust, we get it! Oh, and the over protective African American wife, now that's original.So the script is predictable, but that is to be expected. What about the action scenes? The Matrix Reloaded proved that a ridiculously long car chase does not a good movie make. And Bad Boys II has three of them! While Michael Bay does have a flair for cool set pieces, it seems that this epicly long film is too ambitious. Without a solid script to keep the stunt course afloat, no amount of explosive shenanigans can save this floundering mess of a movie.For fans of Bay only, and I'm not sure how many of them there are.",Bad Boys II
218,jpking-1,Bad Boys II,10,15 October 2005,"by Ray HamiltonThe movie that l am reviewing is Bad Boys II. This movie begins in Miami, Florida. It focuses on two former Miami Police Department officers who struggle to stop the distribution of drugs.Bad Boys II is full of action. It includes shooting, fighting, car chasing scenes, and more. Without this action the movie would be really boring. The best action was the car chasing scene. This scene adds so much excitement to the movie.Another reason this movie is good is the drama. The dialog determines, more than anything, how the movie is going to be rated. Arguments improve the movie's drama and also it's humor. The last example of drama is the acting. This makes you feel the emotions of the actors.Bad Boys II is heavy with humor. My examples include the jokes, some of the action scenes, and the way some of the people talked. The producer tried to connect with the audience by making them laugh. Comedy is probably one of the best ways to persuade people to come and see the movie.Last, but not least, I chose this movie because of the suspense. One example came from an action scene when the actors were driving and the Haitians were throwing cars at them. You didn't know if they were going to get hit or what. Another example was an explosion that the actors were in. For a moment you felt they were burned in the explosion, but they made it out. The last example was when one of the actors almost got shot. Luckily, his partner came and saved him from getting shot in the head.As you can see, Bad Boys II is full of action, comedy, drama, and suspense. If you haven't seen it, then I would recommend that you do.",Bad Boys II
219,kellyap7,I enjoyed it...but my conscience tells me I shouldn't have.,7,28 July 2003,"This is really a tough movie to review... Technically (as in technologically), the movie is outstanding.  The special effects are top-notch - a good step or two beyond what you usually see in movies these days.  If much CGI was used, I couldn't tell.  The plot was entertaining enough, and the movie was a bit long, but I never felt like it was dragging. There are some VERY funny parts...However, the problem with this movie lies in its darker sides...and there are a number.  This is definitely not a movie for kids, or really anyone under 18.  In fact, the movie should be rated NC-17, or at least something to make it obvious that it pushes the ""rated R"" envelope for violence.  Some might argue that I just have a weak stomach.  First year anatomy required us to open a person's chest, and then dissect everything in it - no queasiness here. This movie has a number of problems. (possible spoilers below)1) The way corpses are treated in the film is very degrading.  Driving a truck over a corpse is defiling it - and certainly not something laughable. Each one of those corpses was a person - someone's recently deceased brother or sister, and having them strewn across the highway is just not funny.2) The depiction of the violence, while amazingly realistic, is a bit ""over the top"". I really don't need to see the splatter and chunks fly off the back of a guys head (gunshot to face) into someone else's face.3) The worst part of this movie is that the characters (police, no less!) don't seem to care about the consequences of their actions. The repeated gun battles and car chases are more than enough proof... At one point, a speedboat flies off a trailer, and the back of it plows through the windshield of an oncoming car.  Having worked in an emergency room, I can not begin to describe what this would do to the occupants of the car. Instead of showing some hint of regret or remorse, our protagonists give us a simple ""WHOA"", and are seen enjoying a Bar-B-Que joking around just a short while later.  This is not an isolated incident, and literally hundreds of innocents would have been killed if these scenes actually took place.",Bad Boys II
220,AlecWingerd,40 Miles of Bad Road on the Wonderland Freeway (Minor Spoilers here and there),7,16 December 2004,"It is a true given fact that most films of the day more and more forsake the boundaries of realism, in order to be able to show more, trash more, destroy more. Basically it is part of why some movies become triple-digit-expensive. Out of the time where the quality of movies was dictated by acting and directing performances, we ventured in a time where success of individual movies was sometimes even watered down by the over-exaggerated use of Lateral Cam and CGI or just the amount of objects that were destroyed on camera in the pursuit of even more imaginative and absurd action sequences.Bad Boys II. In many ways, the film was a decent sequel to a successful movie, aside from the massive amounts of recurrent profanity throughout the 140 minutes of film. Martin Lawrence displays his ability to mold his face in any possible expression, a requisite that had paid him well in his films and his personal series, 'Martin'. Aside from playing a small man with a big mouth, he delivers the 'visual' comedy to the movie, whereas Will Smith, like in the first film, had the edge when it came to his lines. The dualism of these two black male characters still did not elude me, and the combination appeared to work still. Sometimes added upon by Joe Pantoliano and his extreme ability to gain the crowd's attention with his vocal talent and body language, it is an OK film, but it would be a lot better if it was slightly shorter. There is however, still this film maker's urge to induce many visual factors to add to the atmosphere of the end-product, but in the process kills the realism. Blue XTC tablets with a female figure engrained on it? From Amsterdam? Another example is the Yellow Hummer crashing through an overly huge amount of cardboard homes, which makes me wonder how much the producers really knew about Cuba or if they were rather more interested in creating this situation in which more useless destruction could be displayed in full. Anyway, who in god's name would drive through Cuba in a Hummer, which is not even 'the' Hummer that some people know and like so well, but an ugly, badly performing surrogate?Here and there, there was some not so mild racist humor lodged in between. What would be meant by the Haitians communicating with one another by the use of horns and drums, living in pink houses and overly equipped with blond dreads and a dialect, things that were probably put in to make them look and sound more stupid rather than giving them individuality. Also the scene in the TV store, though certainly one of the better ones, showed us the extent of stereotypic relations between the looks and the opinions of bystanders. Though most characters were very superficial (the two lead chars Lowrey and Burnett weren't deepened out at all), the bad guy, played by Jordi Mollà, grants us a few scenes of enjoyable acting and a constructive emotional base for his actions as a drugs kingpin.Basically, Bad Boys II remains a worthy sequel and an all in all enjoyable movie. You do have to get past a few scenes of which the edges could easily be trimmed slightly. Cutting 10 minutes of its total length in arbitrary pieces of scenes would be a great improvement. In short, it has a little bit of everything; Humor in dialogue, though way inferior to The 51st State, nice visually improved car chases and some above average throughout performance.6.5 / 10",Bad Boys II

I must say though that Smith really showed his skill in this role.  He's becoming a serious actor, and one with alot of potential for good roles like this one.Heck, I'd see this movie again just for the sake of the car chases.  It's about time they show a V-12 Ferrari chasing a car delivery trailer while the bad guys cut loose the cars from the top trying to nail the Ferrari.  Talk about eye-candy!I've always thought Michael Bay has a very rare talent in bringing out the best in movies he works on.

223,Chris Engelbrecht,BBII is a disgrace and a tragic lie...,1,15 October 2004,"The biggest problem with Bad Boys 2 is not that the humor has been systematized, that there's no originality or intelligence in the storyline, or that the film is poorly paced and way too Kevin Costner-like long...The biggest problem of this film is Jerry Bruckheimer. If he really wants to agitate pro American values and con Cuban socialism, this is not the way to do it, even at this ultimate mainstream level. His production 'Black Hawk Down' succeeded where 'Pearl Harbor' failed. You understood why the US troops actually were the good guys when all was rounded up, where this constellation was an insult in PH. You could hope that Jerry had learned the lesson after that, but then he launches BBII. What the heck is wrong with him? To point out: A violent Columbian drug lord cannot in any way set up a drug traffic operation out of present day Cuba let alone build his own mansion in the wide open land. If he tried, Fidel Castro would immediately have him rounded up and shot, he'd most likely blow his brains out himself to prove a point. Fidel Castro may be an extreme dictator, but the political reality is that he hates drug dealers and organized criminals to the core of his body, because his extreme ideal is based on humanism. One of the main reasons that Castro, Guevara and others in the 50's rebelled violently against Cuba's former dictator Batista, and one of the main reasons why millions of Cubans actually supported them to victory, was that Batista for years had made Cuba a haven for drug lords from Columbia and Cosa Nostra gambling & prostitution tycoons from USA and Italy, making Cuban life more miserable than anything they must encounter today. Claiming that the opposite is true, that Castro can be bought by the kind of people he hates more than anything, is not only a political contradiction in terms, it's a gigantic and dangerous lie. Dangerous because it tries to convince the mainstream audience that the Cuban problem lies somewhere it's not. If Master Jerry really wants to tell people about the drawbacks of Castro's policies, then he must first accept and ally with the truth. That won't prevent him from producing a blowout of an entertainment flick and make a [S-word] load of money, as BHD proved. This is not healthy political agitation at the people's level, this is disgusting nationalist propaganda. The deep travesty about it all is that this 130M$ insult actually made ends meat.

Whats the matter with people!?As he did with the very small budget on the first film, Michael Bay has made a very good job of Bad Boys II. He uses his money well, and presents us with some real edge-of-your-seat set pieces, all cut together at a furious pace. BUT HE'S NO MCG! Bay never crosses the line of being simply stupid.
The performances from Smith and Lawrence are just as expected - they obviously sway from the script many times, choosing to improvise scenes more often than not - there are few double acts in the business who can do this so effectively, Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson perhaps being an exception. Will Smith manages to hold the scenes down as Martin Lawrence hams it up as the nervy, slightly crazed family man thrown into hellish gun battles every day on the job. Smith remains the only actor who can star alongside Lawrence, and have him be funny rather than annoying...Some of the stunts in this movie are incredible, and the 1st big car chase is something that will have any action fan falling off their mosquito infested cinema seat - forget the Matrix Reloaded - this is the greatest car chase ever captured on film.The script is patchy, making way for more improvised gags rather that creating a deep story, but in a film like this, deep plot just isn't what fans want. Joe Pantoliano is again a highlight as the Captain, and has to be considered one of the best police captains since that old guy from the police academy movies...All in all, a near-perfect action comedy.

It comes close to the ""Enough Already"" level of action as in Armageddon, but holds off with all the humor brought by the stars.  Was there one too many car chases?  Yeah, probably, but I'm not complaining.  Two and a half hours looks just fine too me.  Personally, I like my action movies to exhaust me.And what action it was.  The car transport chase is easily better than anything in the Matrix Reloaded and even T3.  Not only that, but it's great to see full blown R rated action in all its bloody glory again.  Ahh, just like the good old days, when men were men, and action movies were all rated R.Look, if you're all about hating Bay, and blaming him for all of scociety's ills, as well as acusing him of being the antichrist - then what in god's name are you doing watching this movie?

232,20057kmz,One hell of a thrill ride,8,20 July 2003,This is in your face moviemaking. It is so cool and over the top that the movie almost creates a new genre all for itself. It is essentially in the same genre as Desperado. Most critics have misunderstood this movie because it is not suppossed to have a friendly and cheesy atmosphere like most action movies made today. Bad action movies such as XXX and Die Another Day come to mind where no one says a single swear word and never acts irrationally even though they are that close to loosing their life. This is not an innocent and kiddie friendly movie and is not meant for anyone below the age of 17. The only flaw with this movie is that the chase scenes are filmed with too much shaky camera and close ups. But all movies the last couple of years with the exeption of Matrix Reloaded had the same problem. On top of all the action the movie has a lot of humour and is worth the price of admission just for that. I give it 8 out of 10.,Bad Boys II

I get the feeling that they've just filmed a bunch of scenes and somebody just cut it all together from 1000 different clips hehe. Anyway, that isn't really what bothers me.Already in the first movie I felt that the chemistry between Lawrence and Smith is weird. If it's supposed to be funny it hasn't aged well since this kind of ""humor"" was fun (I doubt it ever has), they're just being nasty towards each other and there's no love there if you know what I mean. It would've been cool if you could sense the glimpse in the eye but no, they're just flat out mad at each other or someone else throughout the film and that's not nice to be a part of. It's uncomfortable, unnecessary and not funny no matter how hard they try.Speaking of funny the overall deliver of jokes doesn't work, I can tell whenever there's a joke and your supposed to laugh but I find myself just cringing.

The first Bad Boys was a vaguely enjoyable buddy movie that broke convention by starring two black cops instead of the traditional one black and one white. The sequel is just a mindless sequence of destruction, violence, and profanity that eventually just succeeds in offending the viewer. Bay is without a doubt the most inept director in Hollywood.  After the pain of Armageddon and Pearl Harbour, how is it that he is allowed to continue to victimise us? Please stop.

237,titan-28,"Bad Boys, Good Movie!",8,23 October 2006,"""Bad Boys II"" was a very nice surprise. When I initially when to see it, I figured this would just be your standard action flick with some nice shots and a few laughs. Boy was I wrong. This was a very excellent movie which always kept you interested and on the edge of your seat. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are excellent together and have very good chemistry. The supporting characters are just as good such as Gabrielle Union, Joe Pantoliano, and Peter Stormare. The story is good, nothing special or really original, but still good. The detectives are after a drug and crime kingpin Johnny Tapia which like many other crime lords in movies can't be touched. Once they think they finally have enough evidence to bring him down, Lawrence's sister (Union) gets kidnapped by Tapia. This of course complicates the situation and they go on an all out assault on Tapia. There is lots and lots of action in this movie. It almost never dies down. There are plenty of gun fights and explosions to go around. You will also get a few laughs from Smith and Lawrence seeing how they both are into a lot of comedy roles. To tell you the truth I think Will Smith is better in an action movie than he is in a straight up comedy. Peter Stormare's character a.k.a. ""The Russian Grim Reaper"" is really cool. I think he is one of the most underrated actors and deserves more credit than he gets. You don't necessarily have to see the first Bad Boys to understand this one, but it would help I think get you to know certain characters better. This movie blows away the first time, in which I thought to just be a decent movie. I give lots of love to ""Bad Boys II"".",Bad Boys II
238,Melanie82-1,Bad II,4,10 September 2009,"It's hard to imagine that anyone out there could actually have been clamoring for a sequel to 1995's ""Bad Boys."" Yet, eight years later, along came ""Bad Boys II"" to remind us that even the least deserving film can get itself a follow-up, provided it has the right amount of high-powered corporate backing and big enough names in the cast to get the job done. As with most sequels, this one comes replete with a Roman numeral neatly tucked behind its title to give it that extra special touch of class. However, in this case, perhaps the II really stands for ""twice as bad."" This new film, which is indeed even longer, dopier and duller than the original, once again stars Will Smith and Martin Lawrence as two Miami P.D. undercover cops who spend most of their time kvetching at one another in between car chases and shootouts (and often during as well). As this is a Michael Bay film, rest assured that the gun battles and vehicular mayhem have been designed on so grand and epic a scale that we wonder that the entire city of Miami along with a good part of Cuba haven't been reduced to rubble by the time Smith and Lawrence are done doing their thing. The nominal plot involves the partners tracking down a Cuban drug kingpin (yawn) who is smuggling Xtasy to the states hidden inside gutted corpses. This allows for some truly vile humor at the expense of some innocent dead bodies (""Six Feet Under"" this definitely is not). To complicate matters, Lawrence's beautiful kid sister is also working undercover for the NEA and the fretting Lawrence does everything he can to make her job all that much more difficult. The screenplay by Ron Shelton and Jerry Stahl encompasses every cop buddy cliché known to mankind. First, we have the hyper distraught captain who somehow fails to see the genius behind the boys' unconventional crime fighting methods. Then, in place of characterization, the boys engage in a running repartee of stale jokes and tiresome put downs that continues on even though all around them bullets are flying and bodies are piling up. Finally, there is the threatened sundering of the team over petty differences and the equally inevitable patching up of differences at the end. And the humor is so lowbrow that the film lacks even the saving grace of laughter to make it all bearable. Basically, this sequel is just another opportunity for Bay to beat his audience over the head with frenetic editing and mind numbing action. ""Bad Boys II"" might have been more aptly named if they had simply dropped the word ""Boys"" out of the title altogether. It would at least have given audiences a more truthful and accurate description of the contents.",Bad Boys II
239,seano-21820,One of the greatest action comedy movies ever,10,24 May 2021,Great movie the last of the really R rated shows will smith & Martin Lawrence had great chemistry on screen really believable partnership. Story & locations were brilliant.,Bad Boys II
240,danim33,Better action and comedy than the first.,9,23 July 2003,"I was shocked and pleased a lot during this film. I had never seen the first movie until I saw the trailer for this one. I rented Bad Boys and liked it, but hoped the second would be better and I was not disappointed. Although often the sequels are not as good as the first, every now and then they take what was a good concept in the beginning, and improve upon it. Bad Boys II has tons of action and despite what the critics say about that being all there was, there was a lot of comedy, and what I thought was a kick-a_ _ storyline. How can people say that this movie was just an excuse for over the top action without story? Did they pay attention? My only complaint is that there was a little too much gore for my tastes, but even that could not ruin the movie for me because it was just too damn entertaining, which afterall, is the WHOLE DANG POINT OF MOVIES PEOPLE!! I hate when I read reviews that say the same standard remarks- ""it was too unrealistic; there was no plot; too much action, etc."" Okay-- if you saw the trailer, then you already knew it was  not going to be an academy award winning drama!! It shows a glimpse of the insane action, including the car chase scene. And as far as unrealistic goes, when are action-cop movies realistic? We have COPS for that. All entertaining police movies push the limits of reality- Lethal Weapon movies, Training Day to name some. At least the action was somewhere in the realm of believability, unlike the last Charlie's Angels movie, which was so far-fetched, but even I accepted that because you are not supposed to take it seriously- it's meant to be campy and fun! SO what I am saying is, this movie was amazing and don't review movies if you do not understand the whole concept and spirit of it. Take each movie for what it is. Even ""Dude, Where's My Car"" is a great movie if you go into it knowing that it is stupid humor. If that is not what you find funny, then it is not your thing. That does not make it bad. Okay, I'm done with the lecture, for now.GO WATCH THIS MOVIE WITH THE RIGHT FRAME OF MIND, PEOPLE! 9/10",Bad Boys II

Second - Every cop has a machine gun Third - before using it he shouts something like ""Police, stop the car etc..."" I don't understand why the director underestimates me. I refuse to believe this movie. I have often said to my daughter that the most important thing is to believe. Terry Pratchet's Discworld is fictional, but I believe to every word of his books. This movie makes me a fool, a fool that loses his time watching nonsenses pretending to appear as a ""police comedy"". When you kill about a hundred man you have to make your choice - is this a farce or this is a hard police story. Keystone policemen are making the same, but nobody is dieing.

Simply put, this was the best summer movie I have seen in a long time.  The feelings of surprise and delight that I had brings me back to the summer that the original Matrix was released.  I will definely buy this when it comes out on video.When the movie ended I had a hurting side and tears of laughter rolling down my face.  I could not believe the chemisty between Martin and Will.  This movie worked for me.  For those of you who chose to hate it or belittle it, what movie this summer would you rank better or more action packed?On a side note, where do my fellow reviewers get the nerve and desire to belittle this movie.  There has been no movie with such little hype that has been any better save Antwone Fisher.If you had only 10 bucks and you could see only one movie this summer.

Watch as it has little to do with anything aside from explosions! Watch as most of the screen time is devoted to things completely unrelated to it! WITNESS the performance of Will Smith! Witness his acting range! From his performance as Black Guy Of Some Authority With A Gun in 'Men in Black,' to his performance as Black Guy Of Some Authority With A Gun in 'I, Robot,' and even right up to his performance as Black Guy Of Some Authority With A Gun in 'I Am Legend,' Will Smith is truly an actor of many faces. So watch, in awe, as Will Smith portrays Black Guy Of Some Authority With A Gun in this film! Witness him use authority! Witness him use a gun! Witness his brilliance! WATCH the drama! Watch as Will Smith and Martin Lawrence harass a teenage boy for no reason! Watch them confirm stereotypes! Watch them fight! And then watch them predictably amend! Watch them shoot guns as they hold them sideways! Watch them go *BLAM! BLAM!* Watch as they blow things up! Watch things go *KLLLBLLLOOOOOOMM!* EXPERIENCE the avant-garde direction of Michael Bay! See how he forgoes characterization in favor of explosions! Notice his absence of originality! Watch him shoot a two hour film as if it were a music video! Watch him shake the camera as if it were dice! Watch him conduct himself as if he had talent! Observe the glazed-over look of the people around you! See that they have shut off their brain! Watch them gaze! Watch them blink! Watch them show no excitement or surprise or emotion at all! They are a testament to Bay's brilliance! Who other than Bay could make such a mind-numbing, cliché-riddled, unengaging, retarded, and pointless piece of cinema!?So see Bad Boys 2! See a truly unbelievable piece of art! See it on basic cable on Sunday afternoon, because that's where excellence lives! See in the DVD collections of 14-year-old teenage boys who live in suburban America and yet feel the need to emulate blacks for some reason, for they are truly excellent and eclectic in their taste!

246,jollio_peppers,Just when you thought summer blockbusters couldn't get any worse,1,21 July 2003,"""Bad Boys II"" is quite likely the worst movie I have seen this year, and in a summer that gave us both ""LXG"" and ""From Justin to Kelly"", that's saying a lot.  I left the film feeling irritated and angry that two and a half hours of my life were spent exposed to unoriginal, vulgar, poorly edited and written tripe.  I enjoy a good action movie.  Chase scenes and things going SPLAT and KABOOM can be fun, but Michael Bay manages to drag every moment for what seems like an eternity.  Several scenes manage to plagiarize one another, and often felt like clips from the trailer instead of part of the movie.  The continuity is horrible, and a chase scene that ends with the ""heroes"" crashing their car into a body of water, is immediately picked up on a road somewhere!  The fun interaction between Will Smith and Martin Lawrence that made the first ""Bad Boys"" enjoyable is pretty much entirely absent.  Between their constant bickering, and dialogue so full of swearing tossed in for kicks, watching them literally becomes a painful experience.  In the place of any real humor, the writers decided to resort to gay jokes to get some cheap laughs.  (Nothing like the threat of anal rape to get the crowd roaring). Every actor in this disaster was reduced to a pathetic caricature: the brassy femme who wants to prove she is as good as the boys, while doing it in a bikini;  the hard-boiled chief who has seen enough of the crime that is tearing his city (and consequentially his mental state of being) apart; JOE PANTOLIANO - WHAT WERE YOU THINKING!!!The movie itself is just so cold-hearted.  To catch ONE drug dealer, the ""heroes"" of this movie cause 2 major highway disasters, and plow over a shanty town in like the 600th chase scene of the movie.  Oh hooray, we got that awful drug lord; sure we killed dozens of people in the process, but at least the kiddies won't get their E as easily anymore.  ""Bad Boys II"" was a bloated mess of a movie.  Way too long, Way too poorly stitched together, and way too stupid to waste any of your time or money on.",Bad Boys II
247,juarez-8,Back in action,8,9 July 2008,"Usually sequels tend to disappoint (Shrek the third, Xmen3, Lehal weapon2 etc) but not this time. I found this film to be as fast paced and action packed as the first one but with one difference- more action.This has all of Bay's trademarks- colourful cinematography, spectacular car chases, orange filters, epic soundtrack and what I loved most about this film was the chemistry between Smith and Lawrence again.Why critics seemed to dislike I don't know but if there's one fault I could find with it is that it does go on for a long time (but not in the bad way in which Pearl Harbour lasted for nearly 4 dull hours). Other than that I can't really find fault with it. The opening car chase scene is amazing benefiting from its amazing sound effects and colourful cinematography.If you liked the first one then there's no reason for you to not like this one. If you haven't seen the first one then don't worry as this film is easy to grasp. I just hope they carry this series on!",Bad Boys II
248,ifilmstuf24,"Bad Boys II is an all-out brutal assault on the senses. If you can handle that, then you are in for quite a ride.",8,22 June 2013,"Bad Boys II rages across the screen for two and a half hours. By the halfway point I was pretty drained, but this worked to my advantage. Michael Bay movies tap a different part of the human brain. Bad Boys II brings the viewer to the darkest parts of the mind, but Bay filters it through a sense of child-like immaturity. This tactic allows the viewer to submit to the images put forth on screen. Instead of being disturbed or repulsed by the extremely dark nature of the humor present, a submissive viewer will go along with this and laugh out loud. A lot of laughter will come from the disbelief of what you are seeing.The stars of the movie, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence return as detectives Mike Lowery and Marcus Burnett. These two are quite possibly the most hateful, immature, sadistic, and despicable movie cops ever. Bay doesn't shy away from portraying shallow and (subjectively) unlikable characters (Pain & Gain, Transformers 2 & 3, Pearl Harbor) but he can ground them in such a way to make them somewhat sympathetic. In this case Mike and Marcus are the rudest most annoying teenage boys you've have ever seen, but dammit aren't they funny? The villain is Cuban drug lord Johnny Tapia played by Diego from 2001's ""Blow"". This is the character in the movie that is most modeled after Bay himself. He's rich (like Michael Bay), selling a product that stimulates the senses(like Michael Bay movies), and he's got babes everywhere (this is a Michael Bay movie). But as always the main star of a Bay picture is the chaos, and boy does he deliver and over-over-deliver. It's hard for me to decide which Bay sequel is truly ""Bay Unleashed"", Bad Boys II or Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. In terms of overall scale and sensory overload, Transformers 2 is the winner. But by default it goes to Bad Boys II if only for one reason, the ""R"" rating, Bay doesn't hold back whatsoever. This movie kicks your ass relentlessly for 148 minutes, if you are feeling any sense of morality while watching this and feel the need to complain, please shut it off immediately. If you can submit yourself to the chaotic realm that is Bad Boys II then you are in for quite a ride.",Bad Boys II

250,kristian-bakdal,Yet another sequel that should never have been made.,2,15 November 2003,"I thought the original Bad Boys was a fairly good movie as far as Hollywood action comedies go. However in the past 8 years my expectation for movies has hightend a bit, obviously more then Michael Bay's ability to direct movies has. Bad Boys II is basically one long gun fight interrupted by some long car chases and a few weak scenes of dialog.As for the cast, well if you've seen Bad Boys I then you know the main characters. Will Smith isn't what you would call a great actor. However one has to respect the fact that he has been involved in a few good movies such as MIB. However in my opinion Bad Boys II is probably the worst of ""all"" the bad movies that he has appeared in. Martin Lawrence was as usual terrible to watch, by far one of Hollywood's weakest actors. The addition of Gabrielle Union was the only real good part of the cast. She's a nice little hottie, who is one of the few actors that deliver a decent performance in the movie.Usually I make mention of the sound track. To be honest I can't remember the sound track for this movie, so I doubt it was anything special. Which means it can't have been to bad or I think I might have remembered it.",Bad Boys II

The comedic pairing of Smith and Lawrence is even better here because of the time that's past to make their relationship feel more authentic. Unfortunately, the film's runtime is also increased by nearly 30 minutes from the previous film and its mostly unnecessary filler moments that feel like they don't have much bearing on the actual plot. Granted a couple of these scenes are fun (we all love that Reggie scene) but most just bring the film to a crawl.",Bad Boys II

Whereas Bad Boys I was a movie about cops who were african americans, this movie is about a disgusting stereotype of african americans who happen to be officers. This movie was offensive and embarassing, to african americans, homosexuals, white males, cubans, latinos, actually, everyone. If there was one redeeming feature of this film, it's Joe Pantialono. He's it, though.The plot is barely passable, the incredibly dangerous flow of ecstacy needs to be stopped, money is being shipped in dead bodies, Cuba is being invaded, civilians must be killed, kidnapped and lots of explosions have to happen. I hate this movie. I do. I can't even imagine who would think it was good, but apparently other people with no taste enjoy it.There's a horrific scene where Will Smith and Martin Lawrence practically mind rape a 15 year old boy who has the audacity to take Lawrence's daughter out on a date.

This is a high octane movie with explosions and and great action sequences.  The only thing I did not like about this movie was that it had too much violence. They also could have done a lot more with the plot of this movie but I guess the director thought people come to this kind of movie for action and not stories so it is hard for me to fault him.

I mean, I know Bruckheimer likes to go BIG...but this was like ""Bruckheimer doing Bruckheimer."" This film was out of control in every way! The level of gore and violence was relentless and mind-numbing. Some things were so bad I found myself asking, ""should I be watching this?"" There are horror movies with less gore. I've never seen so much remorseless killing in any movie. It's really sad to think that this is what we've come to since the days of Lethal Weapon.

Walking into the theatre for this movie, my expectation were extremely low, and to those this movie delivers. While it is entertaining and funny at certain times, this movie is filled with action sequence clichés which could be viewed in movies such as Lethal Weapon, Beverly Hills Cop etc. These movies, being relatively old, offered some originality on their release, Bad Boys II, however, is a complete remake of the oldest action sequences we have seen hundreds of times over. While the plot, being fuzzy, unsynchronized but decent, is astonishingly way too long. two and a half hours is enough to make people cry at the thought they have to sit through this entire movie and not being fully gratified by viewing it.

But it's Burnett's arc and evolution that bring this movie down. M. Lawerence does a great job but his character regresses to pre-pubescent emotionality that doesn't jive with all he went through in BB1. Plus, his arc has him promoted a rank which implies a cool-under-pressure that should fly in the face of his outbursts. And, don't defend Burnett's actions as comic relief-that's a cop out, pun schmun.
It's a let-down that his ""protective brother"" angle over Syd (a federal agent) becomes a default behavior and not the Lieutenant that he is. His lack of awareness in and of every situation he's put in is excruciatingly unfair to the growth of Burnett established in BB1. He nullifies the dynamic with Mike Lowery that was so great about Bad Boys-chemistry. Again, don't call him comic relief, ain't buyin it.

What a wild, surprising and funny time they have! I know the storyline doesn't sound very convincing, but, this movie is not 'okay' as most people put... it's the action movie of the year! The storyline is, as I said, probably not very convincing and that lots of movie have been made like that and you think that you've seen every on of them...But if you watch this movie, you'll be really, really surprised.

264,rightback15,Bad Boys II... Absolute Adrenaline Rush!!,10,30 March 2007,"I think that bad Boys II is a great film!! Its an action movie, loaded with action and humour!! Bad Boys II is the sequel to the all time classic Bad Boys (1995), (i think one of the best action comedies ever), only difference being, the two loose-cannon cops are after a Cuban, and this film also stars the sexy Gabrielle Union as Martin Lawrence's sister in the film.I think Bad Boys II contains everything you need to make and action comedy, just all the ingredients put together and baked to come out with the perfect dish, this case being Bad Boys II.In this film there are slight differences such as the Burnett's and Lowrey's rival cops, of course a better car (instead of the 911 Turbo they switched to a Ferrari 550 Marinello, but in some scenes a Ferrari 575M), also the introduction of Burnett's sister, as played by Gabrielle Union ( as i have already described).If you are wanting to rent a funny movie, with tonnes and tonnes of action, i'd highly recommend this, its a 2 hour thrill ride that will either have you laughing or gasping, that will make your adrenaline pump like it never has before!!

Otherwise, if non-stop action, jokes and supurb buddy cop scenes, and did I mention big (bleep) explosions and action, is your thing run out and see this. I highly recommend it!",Bad Boys II
268,FClubPrez,The kind of movie that looks great in the previews but sucks in the theatre,5,20 July 2003,"Once upon a time, action movies made sense; they didn't try to be funny to the point that they would make the comedy genre, and they had enough action to make a scene realistic.  Bad Boys II by comparison is an over the top gaudy movie that is backed by its own awesome 160 million dollar budget. It tries to out-do every consecutive scene from the previous one with bigger explosions, more ludicrous scenarios, and unfunny crude jokes.Director Michael Bay this time seems to have outdone himself.  This movie is similar to Matrix Reloaded in which the Wachowski Brothers also wanted to show off their technical and cinematic action scene abilities.  But it's different because it doesn't regard international law, domestic law, and seemlessly turns Miami into a battle torn playground.  If this was even modeled by real life, these heroes would have been fired within the first 10 minutes of the movie.The movie revolves around the two police officers from Bad Boys II: problematic husband Marcus Burnett(Martin Lawrence) and rich bachelor Mike Lowrey(Will Smith).  They are part of the Tactical Narcotics Team(TNT) of the police that deals with matters that overlap the Drug Enforcement Agency. It seems that the TNT can cause mass havoc without a reprimand, enter homes without warrants, and shoot up armies of other countries with absolutely no problem at all.  Fast forward every 10 minutes and you get a new scene that wants to outdo the previous one, not only in effects but in presentation. The movie wants to engross the audience so much in these explosions that it fails to capture the essense of any of the characters.  You don't care if anything happens.  In fact, the 146 minute movie seems to drag along with neverending action scenes, scenes which are mastered to perfection in technique, but lack the emotion and whole heartedness of a true action flick.This time, the TNT has to track down one of the biggest ecstasy dealers in North America.  This dealer has capture Burnett's sister and off to the rescue is this duo with their team that break every law the police stands for.Just about everything is morbid and crude about this movie: a drug dealers who ships drugs in carcasses, jokes about rats getting laid the ""human"" way, and people getting their heads blown off.  Maybe I'm missing the point, but aren't police supposed to save lives?Is this movie visually appealing?  Yes.  Does the action satisfy the moviegoers?  Yes.  Is it worth your $8.00?  No.  The endless one-liners and anti-hero pattern inherrant in these two ""heroes"" make one want to just toss this movie strip into the trash and burn it to ashes, which is where it should belong.5/10",Bad Boys II
269,poeticstickman,Fun time. Don't bring your brain though.,7,18 July 2003,"This is a real fun movie if you can remember to forget to bring your brain to the theatre which i can do. Most movies have boring spots at some point, but Bad Boys is always action packed. I thought it was better than the first, maybe not as hip because the leads are now old fogies, but Lawrence is very funny. He should be funny since this is the 50th straight movie he's played a cop. Anyways. It's good, but (spoilers) I just want to see the deleted scenes on the dvd when the military questions why Miami PD is fighting the Cuban Army, why Mike Lowry never asks for backup,and why special op guys from wars past are willing to risk their lives to save one girl. Not very realistic, but a lot of fun, and very funny. Peace out yalls.",Bad Boys II
270,fulfreez,"Woah! When does the ""excitement"" stop?",6,22 July 2003,"The original BB was a hit and it deserved it when it distinguished itself from every other action film.  It had action and it had sex appeal and plenty of spent bullets but the plot between Smith and Lawrence was actually interesting andfun to watch.  Now, at two and some hours long, and their hate-hate relationship drilling you the entire time, you aren't so much worried about whether they live or die, but whether they will do either anytime soon.",Bad Boys II
271,spbal55,Great Popcorn Flick,10,15 August 2005,"Bad Boys II is one of those films you can watch with a bunch of friends and be thoroughly entertained, because you really don't have to pay much attention to the story because there really is none. This film works because Micahel Bay & Jerry Bruikheimer know how to make fun movies. What makes this film great, is mainly the on screen chemistry of Will Smith & Martin Lawrence, who are great together. Superb action sequences, especially the freeway scene (makes the Matrix Reloaded look like a puppy). With Smith & Lawrence you can expect big laughs (especially the scene where they scare the crap out of a young teenager). Overall I highly recommend this film, not for kids or young teenagers.",Bad Boys II
272,Brooks5-1,Too long!!,6,17 September 2009,"I actually expected this film to be even worse that it was. (You might notice my review is nearly 2 years after the film was first released.) But I watched it on one of those nights where I just felt a need for some mindless, high-quality shoot-'em-up action. BAD BOYS II delivers on that score. There is a highway chase scene early on, where the bad guys are driving a trailer lugging a bunch of cars on their way to a dealership. One by one, they start throwing the cars off the trailer, and the consequences are quite spectacular. The effects are convincing, lots of things explode, crash, fly into the air, etc. Later, a large boat is used as an obstacle, with even more mayhem ensuing. In the car, Martin Lawrence and Will Smith exchange witty banter to show how cool they are (or at least, Smith is). It's a satisfyingly effective, exciting and expensive scene. I dare say it gives the now legendary car chase in MATRIX RELOADED a run for its money. There are some other nice action sequences (a shoot out in a Jamaican bad-guys filthy lair is amusing and stylishly shot). Michael Bay certainly has his own style. It's not actually a GOOD style overall, but it's unmistakable. Extremely brief scenes one after another to make exposition seem exciting. Swooping camera angles. Over the top sound mixes. It's all designed to provide a treat for the senses, I guess..but it becomes a bit much. I can't believe he was allowed to get away with a nearly 2.5 hour movie. This is a popcorn action flick and its most disposable, and yet just when the movie ought to be over...there's a long and frankly poorly executed rescue scene in Cuba. It hasn't got half the adrenelin rush that the early chase scene did. Yes, it has the biggest explosions, but it's somewhat confusing and by this time, we just want it to be OVER!! Will Smith gets to cuss a lot in this movie..but otherwise it's pretty much the same schtick he always gives us. Martin Lawrence's character is all over the place. Is he a reluctant cop dealing with anger issues? Is he the comic relief? Is he Smith's equal in the action department? Who knows and who cares. I know some people like Lawrence. Count me out of that bunch. Joe Pantoliano is wasted in a poorly written role as their captain, who gets to go on tirades about the destruction these guys cause. (Frankly, if a chase scene like the one we see ever happened in real life, it would be MAJOR, MAJOR national and international news...not just something your boss yells at you for before telling to go ""get back out there and get those guys."" I can't help but think that in the scene as shown, probably 50 people died and about 200 cars were destroyed, along with millions of dollars in property damage. But in the world of BAD BOYS II, no big whoop. The movie needed tightening up, more than anything. Let's stick to the action, cut needless ""character development"" scenes, which Michael Bay couldn't pull off convincingly if his life depended on it (you can tell he doesn't care about them), and confine Lawrence and Smith to the humorous banter and stay away from the loud, senseless, repetitive arguments.",Bad Boys II
273,Zambelli,"You needn't take it any further, sir. You've proved to me that all this ultraviolence and killing is wrong...",1,21 July 2003,"Somewhere in the middle of Michael Bay's latest self-indulgent piece of movie dung, I found myself thinking of Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" and the scene in which Alex is strapped to a chair, his head immobilized, his eyes forced open, and film clips of murder, rape and Nazi crimes are projected onto the movie screen until he finds himself unable to take any more, sickness overcomes him and he cries out for the torture to stop. I cried too, but my projectionist wouldn't stop the movie for me.""You needn't take it any further, sir. You've proved to me that all this ultraviolence and killing is wrong, wrong, and terribly wrong. I've learned me lesson, sir. I've seen now what I've never seen before. I'm cured!

274,OneFiveSixFour,A Brutal Fun Time,9,16 January 2020,"Based on character actions and morals this should be one of my least favourite movies of all time.This is a movie about two police officers who brutality kill people, destroy people's property, and who are cruel to innocent people for fun.But on a pure entertainment level, Bad Boys II is two hours and twenty minutes of Explosions, Car Chases, Shoot Outs, One Liners, Jokes At The Misfortune Of Others, And Will Smith / Martin Lawrence Banter.And if you're looking for the latter things, you will certainly enjoy Bad Boys II",Bad Boys II
275,donikatz,but it's so loooooooong,6,1 August 2003,"ok, BB2 is a perfectly explosive, funny cop buddy movie. it's got pretty much what the first one had, although Gabrielle Union definitely deserves more screen time. The main problem is 2 1/2 hours of the same virtually non-stop action is just way over the top. a brainless action movie should not be putting you to sleep, and this one can, just becuase of the endless repetition. huge car chases are one thing, but how long can you watch the same thing again and again and again? they could have easily chopped 30-40 min off of this movie. it reminded me of FaceOff, where you think the movie is finally over, but then... a whole other action scenario. geez, was that really necessary? i wanna go home already!!!

277,Computer_Stud,Not As Good As The Original,5,17 May 2008,"I must say that I was excited to see another Bad Boys movie because I am a loyal fan of the original movie, which I have seen countless times. After seeing this movie, I can say that I'm still a loyal fan of the original but I can't say the same for this one.In the original movie, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence were both emerging stars coming from hit TV series and made history as two African-American actors co-starring in a buddy cop action comedy. Both of their characters were intelligent, cool, hilarious and tough cops that you wanted to emulate. The first movie brings you into the life of the smooth rich playboy yet dedicated supercop Mike Lowrey (Will Smith). Mike is bent on avenging the murder of an attractive friend and informant, who was killed by a French drug-lord, who has stolen evidence of heroin from the Miami PD. However, as the movie continues, the audience gets to learn more about Mike's edgy, less smooth but equally effective married partner Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence), who becomes the center of the movie, attempting to put the drug case together by protecting the witness (who believes he's Mike) while trying to keep his family none-the-wiser about his new police assignment. By the end of the movie, both heroes save the day and Mike gets his justice on the main villain.The sequel seems to follow the original eight years later but with a new twist. This movie begins by leading you into the personal conflict of Marcus Burnett, who is undergoing anger management and considering a break in his partnership with Mike in order to have a more peaceful and less stressful police career. However, as the movie progresses, it begins to center more on the supercop ways of Mike Lowrey, who is almost single-handedly trying to put a stop to an Ecstasy ring involving a Cuban drug-lord and a Russian buyer while at the same time trying to maintain a romance with Marcus' sexy sister, without his partner finding out about it. By the end of the movie, Mike, more or less, saves the day and gets the girl while Marcus gets back into the swing of the dirty world of cop work by finishing off the main antagonist in the final act.Both movies have their charm but the dialogue and the realism of the first movie is lost in the sequel. The sequel relies on cheap gags to gross out and shock the audience and less on the witty improvisational skills of Smith and Lawrence. Plus, the characterization of the two lead cops is too different that you sometimes don't feel like you are watching a sequel but a completely different movie. In the first movie, both cops could be funny and serious. Here, the screenwriters seem to have Smith tightly drawn as the brash action hero, with little chance to show any vulnerability. While Lawrence gets a few dramatic moments, for most of the movie he is stuck playing the goofy comic sidekick. While some may find this contrast to be an effective formula for the buddy cop genre, unfortunately, this strict straight man-funny man routine takes away from the realistic aspects that made the first movie work. Overall, this movie has some great action, with intense shootouts and car chases but a better script with stronger characterization and a natural exchange of dialogue that focuses on the chemistry of the two actors would have made this a more worthy sequel.",Bad Boys II
278,erum_rocks,"Cool and exciting, definately a movie to see in Theatres *possible spoiler*",10,19 July 2003,"It was amazing, and a lot of fun to watch in theatres. This movie is an entertaining film for people who love action(like me), for people who love humerous sh**t(like me), and for people who can handle the creepy things shown in this movie...like...human guts....and u should check out the movie if ur interested so far ;)The actors, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence work great with eachother. This movie can get people's attention quickly, because it's unique and it's a sequel that stands by itself. It doesn't need any support from the first ""Bad Boys"" movie. THat movie was great, but this movie is incredible. Some things might be irritating in the movie to a certain audience, like the dead bodies, and how Johnny Tapia(the a**whole) had the person's(he was doing a ""deal"" with)partner cut up to pieces(body parts were all in a huge tin can on top of the table with all the blood dripping), it's fake but sooo crazy.

My expectations were very low tho, considering all the ""WANNABE BLOCKBUSTERS"" I watched this summer. TBH all of them ruined my appetite for action flicks. Nevertheless I changed my mind and went to ""Bad Boys 2"" And I couldn´t believe it: IT ROCKED ! The problem with most comedy/action movies is, they put to much stress on the comedy factor, so afterwards the audience won´t even take the action/story seriously. BUT NOT HERE. Michael Bay knew what he was doing, so expect some ""serious car chases and gunfights"". Forget ""A-Team Style"" where they waste 10 mags of ammo and nobody is hurt, or cars spinning around their own lengthwise axis 10 times in air, crashing into a canyon and the driver climbs out untouched.""POSSIBLE SPOILERS""There are lot of impressive scenes, so it´s hard to tell which one is the ultimate. F.e. a car chase on a highway, where the gangsters start dropping cars from their truck onto the roadway to get rid of their chasers. Or another car chase where a hummer ""floors"" about 30 houses made of steel plates (in the slums of Cuba), since they are full of chemicals for drug production u can guess what happens :)But this movie wouldn´t be anything without Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, they add this secret element that makes movies like ""Bad Boys"" work.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",Bad Boys II

Put them together and add liberal amounts of Michael Bay and you get this piece of dreck.Bad dialogue, bad acting, bad writing.  Attention, stupid American moviegoers: this is NOT how an action movie is made.  If you can pry yourselves from the TV long enough, go rent Hard-Boiled or The Killer or A Better Tomorrow and see how balletic gunfights and action are done.
If you absolutely positively MUST have car chases, try The French Connection or Bullit.But back to this horror...Will Smith rattles off his lines with all the intelligence associated with a 'hood gangbanger.  Martin Lawrence just throws a chicken-on-acid headtwitch and semi-coherent ""Yeah!"" in periodically.  If he did more, it was drowned out by the up-to-eleven sound volume and ""music"".-10 out of 10.  Please, please, please don't go see this offense to everything.

290,mr_skandl,Cash-filled compost pile!,1,4 October 2003,"Let me be blunt: This movie sucked! It was as if Bruckenheimer and Bay were trying to see how fast they could make their astronomical budget vaporize. The first movie was a well-built machine; stylish, and smartly edited, with tons of charm. Like a puzzle, every piece of dialogue fit somewhere and had meaning. The plot was also good, incorporating well-constructed characters, with a clever blend of action and comedy. It seemed like an urban rip-off of Miami Vice. But, that's sort of why I liked it. It was funnier, applying less of a cheese-factor. In the sequel, it's like, ""Let's just write a bunch of crap to fill this random ten minute scene en route having another pointless chase sequence or explosion."" (Note:I don't mind chase scenes or explosions. However, it does kind of bug me, when, because of the Parkinsons-afflicted camera man, I can't tell what the hell is happening.) In the original, they made the bad guy really creepy and unlikable (in a good way). After five minutes, you hated the guy. So naturally, in the end, you were delighted to see Smith and Lawerance bust this dude. In BB2, the guy was such an idiot that I almost felt sorry for him. When they finally nailed him, I could have cared less. (It was also too long.) Mainly I was of peeved that they sissy-fied the character played by Joey Pants. Going into this vehicle, I wasn't expecting to witness high art, but did figure that I'd view a captivating ""guilty pleasure"". Instead, I was bored senseless, and aggravated by beyond belief(during the siezure-inducing chase scenes, mainly). Bad Boys is truly one of my favorite action films.

Will Smith does a great job of reprising his role along with Martin Lawrence. What else makes this film enjoyable are the villains. There's Johnny Tapia and the string of other bad guys that are hilarious. But what I loved the most was the action. The highway car chase involving the Haitians and the Hummer at the end along with everything in the middle make this film awesome and amusing. This movie is a perfect 10.

292,actionman133,"Good and bad, but couldve been much better",5,17 May 2004,"when one says bad boys, we all remember will smith and his $105, 000 porsche 911. when we say bad boys 2, we remember... not much at all actually.bad boys was a sleeper hit back in 1995, because it had solid amounts of dark humour, strong action and style. bad boys 2 delivers it in bucketloads, and its not necessarily better.in the first bad boys, everyone had something to prove. for bay, smith and lawrence, they all had to prove themselves in this movie. also the budget wasn't very big, so the action was 'condensed'. but in bad boys 2, there are no such issues. i loved bad boys, but i only kinda liked the sequel. so why?1. This is probably the biggest one. There is no core to bad boys 2. the original was set about will smith's anger to catch the man who killed max. but there's none of that in bad boys 2. the characters are basically just strolling through the story, even with the conflict between them.2. bad boys didn't take itself seriously, except for a couple of scenes, and to its benefit. the light drama works because of will smith's acting. the sequel tries to present a genuine conflict between marcus and mike, and also between marcus and his sister. the drama is too often hokey, because it is underdeveloped, and michael bay tries to get involved. face it, he cant do drama.3. The action. as i said before, the budget limited the amount of action in bad boys. so the action lasts only long enough to give us the adrenaline rush, and then the next scene comes in. in the sequel, the action is far more impressive, and a treat to watch, but it just keeps going for its own sake. the haitian house raid, for example, needn't be so long. it shouldve been a minor setpiece, but instead its overblown.4. also sadly missing is bad boys' colour pallette. there were some greatly lit scenes in the original, and some crafty colors. think of the orange hue in its opening scene. with the exception of the haitian's house and the opening bust, bad boys sadly lacks coloured light. it was one thing i was looking forward to in the movie, and i barely found it.now don't get me wrong, i enjoyed bad boys 2 for the most part. the causeway chase in particular still has me drooling. the comedy is also usually very funny, but again it also tries a little too hard to impress. but there are some moments to be had.I think bay may have lost touch with his audience. He doesn't seem concerned if there's too much action, even for male teens. its almost like he made this film because he can, not to provide entertainment. consider the running time of 2.5 hrs. thats far too long for a popcorn movie, no matter the content. that's my opinion and i hope I'm wrong.still, the movie works on some levels.ultimately, a mostly fun but deeply flawed popcorn blockbuster.5/10",Bad Boys II
293,mat-tuck,"Its a film with II in the title, this could be bad.",3,3 June 2004,"Think of films with ""II"" in the title and some horrors spring to mind. Bad Boys II is nothing like the original cop movie which the characters Marcus and Mike, played by Martin Lawrence and Will Smith, have a bad ass partnership in. This movie is as far from the original make up as it could be. It would have been better to of not called this film Bad Boys II as the viewer arrives with pre-conceived expectations from the original movie. I got the impression that perhaps Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson had lifted dare I say the car chase scenes from other movies. The highway smash up chase, seemed all too Luc Besson ""Ronin"" / ""Taxi"", and the attempted sealing of a small economy car ""Die Hard"".Personally I love good car chase scenes, and seeing as within 35 mins of the film run this happens for quite a chunk of the action - I would expect it to be the best. It was a disappointment - ask the question, why cant Mike's Ferrari out run a truck fully laden with a car transporter? (Mike's character doesn't come across from the original movie as somebody who would ditch a Porsche for one!) Why can the 4x4 just push its way out of the pile of cars? what happened to low ratio gear box and foot to the floor? OK its make believe but if you want your viewer to believe - make it real! As as for the dubbed ""revving"" sounds - please.....This movie, would be better is the timing was cut short by 30 minutes it too long and I found myself thinking, get to the end. In the UK this film is rated ages 15 and above, the movie does have its fair share of blood and cuts with scenes of chopped up bodys, headless torsos, and people being dismembered. A little strong for some younger viewers. Overall if you rented the movie, you just take it back. If you bought it, oh well, there's always ebay.",Bad Boys II

It was a great movie to see in the theatre, and when a movie is 2 1/2 hours long in the theatre, most people don't wanna sit there that long. This isn't your typical Lord Of The Rings crap where it's 4 hours of boredom, it's wall to wall action, and great storytelling to make a great action/comedy. I actually prefer this movie over the original Bad Boys because it has better action sequences, less boring parts, and a better story/plot. One thing I am WAY disappointed about and it disappoints me more and more with the fact that DVD is taking over, is the fact that Widescreen is RUINING movies! and the movie industry forces this WS crap down our throats. I just recently bought this movie (BBII) and it didn't say on the box if it was full screen or wide. I don't care if it's both, or if it's the WS ratio (1.85:1), it's not that bad, but I prefer Full Screen, so I get it home and find out that it's the crappy version of Widescreen (2.35:1), and then I read the aspect ratio on this site and it says that it's WORSE! it's actually (2.40:1), so damn man, when are the movie companies gonna realize that not everyone in the world is a rich person and/or celebrity and not everyone can afford those 1000-5000 dollar Widescreen home theater TV's? I am really getting sick of the fact that they no longer make full screen movies, only the occasional movie gets released with FS, so people get cheated into buying a movie that doesn't say which aspect ratio, or doesn't even say widescreen or Full Screen so people can pick and choose the one they want. I bet way more people buy FS versions than these crappy WS versions. But oh well, I will end this by saying I am VERY disappointed with my copy of Bad Boys 2, and recommend that people DON'T buy it if they hate Widescreen like I do. Don't waste your money. When they play the movie on the movie networks, they are full screen so what the heck is the deal there? why can't they release it to the public? Well that's all from this disappointed Bad Boys fan.",Bad Boys II

There is a lot of gratuitous violence- heads exploding from gunshots, etc.  Lots of gore, dead bodies.  Only one or two genuinely funny moments, like when they greet the daughter's boyfriend for the first time.  I'm all for action movies and blowing c**p up, beating the c**p out of someone, etc, but this was too much.  This movie's convoluted and utterly unbelievable plot had some drug kingpin's cover operation in a funeral home.

296,renodc,"Bad Boys, Bad Movie",2,3 February 2004,"This movie had some great action sequences, but in the end it was disappointing on several levels. First off, the plot (if you can call it that) was extremely weak.  The dialogue was mindless and absolutely atrocious.  It's one thing to toss in some swearing for emotional effect, but the amount of cursing in this movie was ridiculous (if this gets aired on network TV, they'll have to make it a silent movie). Each scene just seemed to be nothing more than a competition between Lawrence and Smith to see who could yell and cuss the loudest. The villain was a joke and his accent was so bad that his dialogue was nearly unintelligible. He sounded like he just had an injection of novocaine in his tongue.  Honestly, this movie just gave me a headache.",Bad Boys II

303,ixzer,Bad Boy II 2 Mean and 2 Long,7,8 August 2003,"Spoilers Ahead:Bad Boys 2 follows the sequel formula of being bigger and louder than the original. It runs for 2 hours and 26 minutes in length and contains more action and stunts compared to the 1995 original. I for the most part enjoyed BB2 more than BB, but that's not really saying much. Bad Boys was a good movie after one viewing, but as you watch it more and more with age, you realize that it's not a very good movie.A lot of what transpired from the 1995 hit, is seen on the big screen with the sequel, however the sequel pretty much just takes that old and worn photo and blows it up 10 times bigger for all to see once again.
Bad Boys 2 was much too long and way too mean.  Sure, the action and the stunts were good and the movie was funny. But it was over the top and I felt guilty after for laughing at such mean acts of comedy. These are suppose to be two cops who try to up hold the law and put a stop to drug trafficking, but instead they kill dozens upon dozens of innocent people while doing so.
Exactly what kind of cop would pretend to be drunk and pull out a gun and threaten and then sexually come onto a 15 year boy? (mind you, it was funny...but I sensed something terribly wrong as I was laughing along with the rest of the crowd.)What kind of cops would race down a hill with homes planted on top of it with a HumVee, destroying everything in it's path? Possibly including more innocent people. Bad Boys 2 is long and It gets tiring after the one hour and forty minute mark, because you realize that it's not going to end anytime soon. The movie does deserve an R rating (living in Toronto, it's a rare thing to occur) and it holds too many unnecessary side plots which evidently extends it's length (The Haitian car chase anyone?).It even goes as far as ripping The Matrix off. However, I think the most annoying aspect of the entire movie itself is the two main characters of Mike and Marcus who never shut up. All they do is yell and swear at one another and they are suppose to be partners in crime. The constant arguments also extends the length of this movie as well. 
Sitting there in the theater, I saw a Micheal Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer movie. I got exactly what I expected (I suppose), but what really killed the movie off for me was it's length. I could forgive the meaness and I could forgive the constant arguing, but when the final act turns into something like The Rock, my eyes were rolling and burning with frustration. Micheal Bay needs to get some new techniques in film-making and I think Bruckheimer needs to be the one who tells him so (Can Bay doing anything by himself???!!!). But like the saying goes, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" and why would they? Their repetitive and tired formula makes money. Who gives a damn what people think.With the success of the sequel, I smell another one coming out in the midst. This time, I predict the set-up will take place in prison where Marcus and Mike are finally imprisoned for life for all the reckless behaviour they have unleashed upon the people of Miami. Hopefully they are incarcerated without a chance for parole, thus providing accuracy for their beloved catch phrase ""Bad Boys for life!"". 4/10.",Bad Boys II

308,JackBauerVsSamFisher,mokri + bay + bruckheimer = a masterpiece in it's genre,10,13 December 2005,"A masterpiece of an action movie is what you get indeed. I recently bought the 2 disc special edition and I must say it's worth every cent. I wish I could have seen it on the silver screen, but you'll still be thrilled with excitement when watching this one! Michael Bay (I know lots of users here don't like him) is in my opinion the God of action movies and one of my personal favorite directors to be walking on this earth. If you have seen The Rock, with Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage, you have to admit you weren't exactly falling asleep.I can't quite remember what the first Bad Boys movie was about, but that's not necessary to understand this one though. The sequel is a whole new story, but fortunately with the same 2 main characters. I wish I could explain what the sequel is about... The fact is, it's about so many things that you might start to think (after you've seen it) that they were like 3 movies in one. Read the plot outline for more information :) Another thing that's rather unusual for an action movie is that it goes on for 147 minutes!! That's just wow, because i can't stand 90 minute movies with lots of action and poor characters. This is a great ride, filled with exciting characters, humor, unexpected plot turns and of course, lots of car chases and crashing cars and so on. Just sit back, turn on your surround system and enjoy the show.And then Amir Mokri. I bet you've never heard of this man, but o.m.g., he is (in my eyes) the *best* director of photography in Hollywood. He also did The Salton Sea, with Val Kilmer. What I personally like so much about him, is his very effective use of colors and camera angles. If you compare, let's say Romeo Must Die, to Bad Boys 2, you'll laugh at the poor cinematography of the first one. In the end, Mokri and Bay are both responsible for the look of the movie, the intensity of the characters, the surroundings, the feelings you get and the overall atmosphere. I'd say that's a big responsibility! Luckily they're so talented to make it all look very professional and very 'never-seen-before'-like.I have little to say about the actor's performances. Martin Lawrence and Will Smith do as usual, a bit better even. ;-) Maybe a bit over-acting by Jordi Mollà, the main bad guy. Peter Stormare is as freaky as he usually is ;-) One last piece of advice, don't switch off your DVD player before the first half hour. I turned mine off when i rented BB2 the first time, regretting it now, of course. You might expect a story about people doing drugs in night clubs, but it's not. Give it (Bay + BB2) a chance, keep an open mind, don't go criticize the movie when watching it, just look. Keep your brain locked in a closet. If you're into romantic comedies or drama's, don't give it a low rating just because you don't like action movies. And if you're a professional critic, at least try to appreciate the work that's been done behind the scenes. It's a masterpiece in it's genre. 10/10",Bad Boys II
309,genixo,Michael Bay's overloaded panache,10,1 June 2004,"A big budget film, which clearly shows how Bay proves to be one the best action directors of all time. Much better than the first one, Bad Boys 2 it's pure fun, even for it's running time(147 mins), Martin Lawrence gives a better performance than Will Smith, the situations in the film are crazy and funny, Lawrence comments about a couple of rats having sex human style is an excess of bizarre humor. Michael Bay seems to be a Miami fan, but also a great filmmaker, explosions and car chases are impressive and overloaded with dead bodies, flying cars, and village destruction, a great spectacle. The sound is charged with dynamic surround field, which makes Bad Boys 2 an excellent experience, pure fun, pure noise, pure Bay.",Bad Boys II
310,Tompson,"Bad Taste, Needless Violence & Pompous Directing",1,27 September 2004,"Bad Boys II is waste of money in all senses of the expression. Wasting money from production point of view for something as stupid as BB II is just incredible. The movie is full of spinning camera angles in about 97,6% of the time. C'mon Mr. Bay, the effect of the circling camera works about once in a 90 min movie if well placed. It is not cool at all when used three times (in slow motion) for every 90 seconds all the way.The dialogue -- well, what dialogue?? Does anyone use the word starting with 'mother' in every single sentence in real life? Mr. Smith and Mr.Lawrence do. The bud chemistry that sort of worked in BB I, is nowhere to be seen in this one. Moving on to the comedy side?? Well, I laughed once for 'Marsupial', enough said.And then the violence. Do we need to see all those bodies created and handled in imaginable ways for humor's sake. I don't know may people who get amused seeing dead corpses decapitated on the freeway. Obviously, Mr.Smith and Mr.Lawrence see that as an appropriate spot for throwing a catchy one-liner as the excellent script defines. BTW, can't recognized actors use own judgment and refuse to deliver the worst stupidities. Obviously not. SPOILER AHEAD: ""So, let's attack Cuba just the two of us... Wait, there are twenty volunteers coming along, thank God. Nothing can stop us now"".As I realize, BB II made well at the box office, which means that we'll see this sort of ""entertainment"" in the future as well.

311,mmcardle,I'd give it a rating of zero if I could,1,17 October 2003,"I was quite looking forward to this as I quite enjoyed Bad Boys.It started with some wild action and wise-cracking from the cheeky duo, but as the film moved on I started to feel more and more uncomfortable.First of all, repetition set in early. How many shootouts, car chases, and arguments between Smith and Lawrence do you need in a film? How many different ways are there to eviscerate someone? And the plot? The plot is this: Smith and Lawrence bust a drugs gang........again.There is much jollity from Smith and Lawrence amidst total carnage. And this is my biggest problem with it. If it was just a bad movie, my comments would have ended in the last paragraph. This is a very very nasty film. Bodies explode, people are shredded by gunfire, limbs sawn off, and heads are sliced off and our two heroes wise-crack their way through all the devastation. Not just wise-crack, but laugh about it. Oh, but it's good fun to wave a gun in a humorous way in the face of a teenage boy whose only crime is to fancy your daughter. And let's have a bit of fun with some dead bodies shall we? The scene that really did it for me though, is when Lawrence is hiding in the mortuary under a sheet with a naked dead girl. I sat in the cinema feeling very uncomfortable. True, this is a ""comedy thriller"", but why such cheapness with human life and sickening use of women? Strangely enough, the film gets serious when Lawrence's sister or daughter(I can't remember which) is kidnapped. The wise-cracking stops and the audience is invited to share Lawrence's pain. I didn't. I wanted her to die so that Lawrence's character learned the value of human life. But, she is rescued and the moment she is safe, it's back to comedic carnage. This was rated 15 for the audience in the UK and I just worry about those young minds watching this. It should have been an 18 certificate (or R-rated in the USA). Better still, it shouldn't have been made at all.I could forgive it for just being a bad movie, but this is sadism and cruelty dressed up as coolness for the 21st century.",Bad Boys II
312,warstrikesback,Too short,10,11 October 2003,"After the calamity called ""Pearl Harbour` Michael Bay has finally returned to his roots and made a bombastic hardcore action movie which will blow you out of your seat.The intense and excessive action - scenes are absolutely amazing and the amount of violence exceeds everything that you might have seen in an action - movie so far. Some people believe that it is unnecessary to depict how corpses get their heads chopped while Mike & Marcus are running over them or making jokes while ripping kidneys out of corpses in the morgue but in my opinion that's the kind of sick humour that this movie needs and somehow it even fits! And don't forget: They are Bad Boys, not Riggs and Murtaugh!Unfortunately the German version is horribly translated. For example the poor 15 years old Reggie is no `Ludacris - lookalike' anymore but is suddenly called `Eminem - lookalike'. Of course no one in the audience was laughing because Reggie is hardly looking like Eminem!I guess if Bruckheimer was watching the German version he would vomit as much as Marcus did in the morgue. Even the fact that the German version was cut for around 5 minutes proves that people in Germany are very easily offended by violence. The other reason is that Columbia Pictures intended to gain a release for kids from the age of 16 so the movie had to be mutilated like this Russian guy in the Tapia mansion.If you have seen a few Bay - movies like `Bad Boys 1', `The Rock' or `Armageddon' and if you liked this movies you will also like (if not love) this one. The spectacular Highway - chase (which obviously has been done without any CGI at all) or even the 360 camera - scene are elements which no other action movie has demonstrated before.I was so incredibly entertained that I wished this movie would run twice as long but I guess in this case I'm the only one. If you are keen on plenty of entertaining testosterone - filled hardcore - action I can only recommend this movie. If your favourite movies are `The English Patient', `Titanic' or 'Pretty Woman' please stay out or otherwise don't complain afterwards!No doubt, it gets 10 out of 10!",Bad Boys II

We decided that at least Damage was short, because Bad Boys 2 ran on for a dreadful 2 hours and 45 minutes with the onslaught of commercials and previews we saw.  How bad was Bad Boys 2?  It inflicted physical pain upon me, making me hurt in no ways a movie has honestly made me hurt.  It was just a huge cliche wrapped in innuendo sealed in really shiny film with terrible signature Bruckheimer slow mo and various other editing techniques.  At certain points, we began to question whether or not after Pirates of the Carribean, Bruckheimer decided to throw caution to the wind and try to make a film as truly horrible as he could. How shoddy was this filmmaking?  You can easily see that the money in the mortuary in which Martin Lawrence and Will Smith ""sneak"" into says ""For Motion Picture use only.""  I went in with low, low expectations and I came out with a new feeling from a movie.  Instead of feeling robbed of money, I felt robbed of time and I wanted my precious nearly 3 hours back.

As a visually stunning cinematic achievment, or as a dizzying display of nothing more than explosions, car chases and paper thin characters. If you are a movie critic I'm sure you looked at it the second way. But as for me and everyone else in my theater, this film was well amazingly well put together. It disgusts me when I read some of the reviews by movie critics, I would like someone to tell me what was so awful about this script! I mean honestly, was it a character driven independent film? Hell no, so than why must everyone take such shock that in an action film involving drugs, cops, and a plethora of firearms that their were (brace yourselfs) deaths! and even worse...swearing! Grow up people, the script was written by adults for adults, I thought maybe that R rating would have given that away. The action sequences were brilliantly put together, and so what if they were over the top. I don't want to go to the movies and see what a real police stand off looks like. I could turn on cable television for that. Michael Bay I commend you not only for this picture but for everyone you've ever done. This is a man who is not only a success at what he does, but does it all with a**hole critics griping over every sequence, over every word of dialogue, over every actor, over every minute detail in his film. And he continues to make these films, and they contain to be more and more successful so tell me James Berardinelli of reel view (Bad Boys II isn't just bad - it's a catastrophic violation of every aspect of cinema that I as a film critic hold dear.) Do you think you are any better? Are five million people going to read your angst ridden little film review? NO!!

A Buddy-Buddy film like Lethal Weapon but younger and cooler.Bad Boys 2 though... is a stinking pile of s***e. Not just bad but awful. I didn't expect a plot but between the explosions, enough ammo to take care of the whole of Miami and the motherf***in' whining of the leads there wasn't a shred of plot. Not a bit. If the plot was a coat moths would starve on it.This is not to say that it is just the plot that stinks, oh no I could cope with that, the effects were just pointless. They are no longer about the film but about effects crews trying to compete in some gore\explosion pissing competition. The Matrix Reloaded had car chase. People were impressed. So BB2 had to have a car chase. On this one has to be bigger. Will Smith is going to drive his Ferrari between cars that a being throw from the back of a transport. Why? Because they can. Because I'm supposed to be awed by this. Has anybody who works on these films ever seen a REAL car chase? I guess not.Hang on though, in this film ONE car chase is not enough. But this time what can we do to freshen it a little make it more exciting? I KNOW let's have them chase a van with corpses in it which then slide out of the back of said van and Will just runs over them! One comically has her head roll away! Oh my aching sides how good is that? Answer? It's not. It's tragic. Why bother having an exciting chase a la Ronin when you can just have wide open roads and throw obstacles in the way instead?What else? Ah yes, the gun fights! Ammo, loud bangs, Will and Martin roll around a bit and the only time when one of them gets hit is when it's 'funny' to do so. I realise that they are the stars but when things get ramped up this far then it goes beyond the point where you can suspend your belief and just becomes plain stupid.Three names that are in this film should have warned me. I didn't think I should have know. Don Simpson\Jerry Bruckheimer Productions and Michael Bay. *Shakes head* I just should have learnt by now. Don Simpson is dead and he's still getting credit for execrable s***e. Poor sod.Don't go to this film.

Lethal Weapon 2,3, and 4 were worthless so this isn't a black thing its a stupid movie thats aimed at young white kids that think they're black.

Welcome to the never ending MTV/BET mentality that will never grow up because they're too scared to be themselves. They're too scared to go to school in the wrong shoes/pants,etc... Pathetic! Movies like these filled that emptiness that instead confirms their stupidity and nurtures it. It becomes the norm and then the rest of us that are ourselves are the ones that are laughed at.

Marcus just wants to be a regular cop and gets dragged into these big gun fights.Overall, an action packed, funny movie without trying to pass some weird message. Just fun.",Bad Boys II
323,lordkinboat-1,"Very funny, very violent.",4,2 August 2003,"There is not too much to say about this flick. It has some very funny scenes, but also very violent ones. Note to Hollywood, stop pushing the gross out factor. I want to be thinking about how entertaining a movie was after I leave it. I do not want to be thinking about how all the violent action is effecting the population at large and why I feel like I need to puke.",Bad Boys II
324,Hazel-Eyes-Dreaming,Bad Boys II way better,10,2 August 2005,"If you liked the first one,or even got bored with like I did, you're going to love the sequel. Bad Boys II has a better storyline and you won't fall asleep. It's so jammed packed with action and comedy, it'll feel like the movie is only a couple of mins. Besides the love affair Will Smith is having, Marcus's sister gets in deep with all the action and they need to help her out before it's too late; when she ends up in Cuba and everyone pulls together to help Marcus out, is a real moment. And you can't forget about Marcus's daughter going out on her first date. That was so funny. They were making fun of her date and trying to intimidate him. The reference to Ludicrous is hilarious...so if you haven't seen it, get off your butt and get it, you won't be sorry.....",Bad Boys II
325,starwarsadmirer90,Bad Boys Is Really Bad....And That's A Good Thing!!!!,10,15 June 2007,"From Director Michael Bay who brought us Pearl Harbor and Armageddon, brings us another great action-adventure film filled with laughs and realistic action. Bad Boys 2 stars Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, and together they make this movie the best as it is giving us major laugh out loud laughs and fight scenes. To me, they are the best on team duo's in the history of cinema. The film starts off in a way that keeps you watching and watching until it's over making you want more. This film has 6 action scenes that are long and enjoyable which you can watch many times and still love it. If you liked the first one, but you wanted to see more about them and see them in more dangerous situations then this film is for you.But if you are not a Michael Bay fan, then just grab a few guy friends and maybe chick friends, get together on a Friday or Saturday night, grab snacks, kick off your shoes, grab a blanket, disconnect your phones, and be prepared for a movie that will keep you laughing and entertained the whole entire night.8/10",Bad Boys II
326,bud-24,Was this a sequel to Bad Boys or Lethal Weapon?,3,9 August 2003,"Warning - May contain spoilers.Watching this movie, I could have sworn I was watching a Lethal Weapon movie.  You've got two cops who have been partners for a long time and act like a bickering married couple.  One threatens to break the partnership while the two are chasing a bad guy.  Bad guy makes it personal by kidnapping a loved one of one of the partners.  The two partners chase after the bad guy and kill him to free the loved one.  All the while, there is bad comedy but amazing stunts sprinkled throughout.  Throw in an Italian-American actor named Joe (Pantoliano vs. Pesci) who has a whiny, annoying voice and the formula is complete.I was really looking forward to Bad Boys II, since I had always wondered why it had taken so long to make a sequel to the first one, which I really enjoyed.  The banter between Will Smith and Martin Lawrence wasn't as good this time and the comedy was way too contrived - ""woosa"" and humping rats. Very disappointing.  Is it too late to make a sequel of Running Scared with Billy Crystal?",Bad Boys II

If you took the time to find some info about the movie before you saw it, the rating will tell you everything you need to know about the movie....Rated R for strong violence and action, pervasive language, sexuality and drug content... Movies have ratings for a reason people, so if things like the mentioned above bother you, well, then don't go see the damn movie! This movie was made to entertain fans of violent action movies.  I give alot of props to this movie for bucking the Pg-13 trend in Hollywood. It hinders its Box Office, but wins it some respect from action fans. Like it or not some people find raunchy and racist jokes funny.  Chris Rock has made a career out of it! Doesn't make you a depraved person because you find it funny.  It's pretty niave to say someone ""needs therapy""  because they like this movie!  If anyone ""needs therapy""  it's you for not recognizing the difference between pretend and real life!

328,King Poet,Top Movie Reviewers Way Out of Touch,9,18 August 2003,"I read Ebert and I usually like Ebert, but something tells me he and a bunch of over-rated movie reviewers screened Bad Boys II at home alone in their giant home theatre rooms with a troth full of snacks while fighting hypoglycemic attacks. Because if they had heard the audience reactions like I did they'd give this movie at least a 'B' for entertainment value alone. Okay Academy Award stuff? No! But is Bad Boys II a great action, drama, funny as heck flick? Hell yeah! Is the movie shameless non-stop-action? Hell yeah again, Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) still protect the streets of Miami, but now they've stumbled onto a ring of Cuban drug dealers smuggling high-potency Ecstasy into the local clubs. Drug lord Johnny Tapia played by Jordi Molla a wickedly wonderful villain. Now we got a real good thriller with brilliant comic relief. I heard people cracking up all throughout the movie. Nothing is cooler than spontaneous eruption of laughter in a theatre with a well-mixed audience. It happens a lot in Bad Boys II. The well-mixed crowd was rolling in the isles. Every bad boy one-liner works in this action flick. I'm a Black guy living in a predominately white suburb my Asian and White friends are laughing as loud as me.Martin Lawrence & Will Smith have way better chemistry than Mel Gibson and Danny Glover. You know why? Because Martin and Will are funny! Roaring funny! And after 90 minutes you think this movie is ready to stop? Hell naw! `See that's that bullsh*t!' As Mike Lowrey played tough by Will Smith would say. But naw it ain't over, its time to invade Cuban airspace to rescue one the finest women on the big screen today, hot star Gabriel Union (`Deliver Us From Eva,' `Bring It On'). Add that with an adrenaline rush of explosions, excessive gore and chase scenes right up there with The Matrix Reloaded, then you got yourself a damn good gotta see summer blockbuster. Led by perennial hot-dog director Michael Bay he did: ""The Rock,"" ""Armageddon,"" and ""Pearl Harbor"". Michael Bays got a real show off cinematography style of directing just right for this high testosterone action flick. The camera kinetically does it's best to keep up with the Bad Boys action. And when it does it's only for slo mo tracking of a bullet from gun to forehead that makes CSI look like a six-grade frog dissection class. Bad Boys II is mo'faster, mo' furious, and 2 exhilarating to see just once. Holla!",Bad Boys II

330,samuel-jamieson,An awful action film which fails to entertain,2,24 July 2006,"To be perfectly honest i can't quite remember what possessed me to watch this film in the first place especially since Bad boys 1 had been undeniably poor entertainment, yet i assume the answer had something to do with Will Smith whom has rarely disappointed in the past. However after about 20 minutes of this abysmal sequel it became quite obvious that it would need a standout performance from him and every other cast member to draw attention away from the painful weak script and at times completely incoherent dialogue. The visuals also failed to impress as the pointless action scenes and car chases droned on for hours after the plot had long been lost. Ultimately this is proof that stuffing long, loud and unoriginal action sequences into about 3 hours will only impress some weak minded small children, boring the ass off anybody who actually wants to see a film.",Bad Boys II

They did it big and they did it good too.

334,Johnlink,great summer flick,6,18 July 2003,"It seems like to many people confuse summer blockbusters with films. The same criteria used for On the Waterfront or One Hour Photo should not be used for Bad Boys II. A summer blockbuster is supposed to be loud, entertaining, and fun. Sadly many aren't, and there have already been a couple of those this summer in Charle's Angeles and League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Bad Boys II, however, definetly delivers. Love him or hate him, no one does it bigger or louder than Michael Bay. While some can't understand how a movie not rooted in deep film technique could possibly do well at the box office, it is pretty apparent that the general public eats it up. I love a great film and I love a great action packed blockbuster, and I have no problem diferentiating bewtween the two. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence make a wonderful team, and Joe Panteleano once again is a scene stealer. The comedy is perfect, the writing is better than the first, and the action is big and obvious.

But when they're p***ed off, you believe it... The defining moment of their relationship is made when mike sez, ""we ride together, we die together... bad boys for life.""  there'z more to that scene than what commercials have shown... when i saw it in theatres, i wuz actually touched... the friendship-factor is played up more in Part II, than in Part I, which i like... it gives u the feel that they are more than just partners... they really are friends who'll do n/ething for each other...the action scenes are freakin' kool... unlike those so-called ""action movie-lovers"" out there who think the violence is unnecessary...

337,flip69fool,this movie is tha s*it,10,9 October 2003,"**SPOILERS AHEAD**VERY LONG REVIEW**I luv to have fun at movies and i want to be entertained.  I had fun & I was entertained at ""X2,"" ""Matrix Reloaded,"" & ""Terminator 3"".  Then came ""Bad Boys II.""  I loved ""Bad Boys,"" so i gave this a shot.  I must say, that ""Bad Boys II"" wuz just way too friggin kool.  I loved every damn second of it.Will Smith & Martin Lawrence return to their roles as Mike Lowrey & Marcus Burnett.  They are just too damn great here.  Their chemistry on-screen is just as enjoyable as it was in the first movie.  This time around, Marcus is much more tense, working with Mike.  While Mike, himself, is much more bad-ass in this film.  Whereas in the first movie, their general lifestyles as a ""family man"" (Marcus) and a ""playa"" (Mike) clash, here in ""Bad Boys II"" the ""zen/spiritual growth"" of Marcus, completely contrasts to Mike's ""easy-going/shoot-em first, ask questions later"" attitude. The way these guys talk to each other is just plain funny & real.  They bag on each other, they swear at each other, and they make life a living hell for one another.... that'z the way it is for many people and how they deal with their friends, so don't cry over the ""profanity.""  Who can honestly say that they haven't said the F-word, or the SH-word, or any other swear word? Damn, right.  Despite all the tension between the two, they still, essentially have love for each other, are there for each other, and rise up to the situation (""We ride together, we die together... Bad Boys for Life"").Supporting characters are great as well.  Gabrielle Union's ""Sydney Burnett"" replaces Tea Léoni's ""Julie Mott"" as the female lead for the movie. Sydney Burnett is Marcus' baby sister, who works for the DEA.  For the past five months, she has been dating Mike behind her brother's back.  When Marcus finds out, it, obviously, pisses him off, and adds even more to the stress of having Mike Lowrey as a partner.  Jordi Molla's villain, ""Johnny Tapia"" is the big-time ecstacy dealer. He smuggles illegal ecstacy to various parts of Miami (in a very creative way), which causes a lot of trouble when a few drug-dealers and dope-runners attempt at stealing ecs.  Johnny Tapia isn't as intense as Tcheky Kayro's ""Fouchet"" from ""Bad Boys,"" but he is a funnier character, especially when it comes to his daugher and his mom.  But he, still, is a pretty bad-ass, considering he's willing to kill his own employees.  Returning from the first movie is Joe Pantaliano, who plays Captain Howard.  He was hilarious in the first movie, in giving the Bad Boys the low-down and getting pissed off at them for ""doing another dead body."" Here, he is even funnier.  He delivers some really great lines, and all his scenes (at the station, near the bank, and at his home) are really funny. Also returning is Theresa Randle, playing Theresa Burnett; Marcus' wife. She didn't do as much in this movie, as she did in the first one, but it's okay.  It was good for continuity to have her in ""Bad Boys II.""The plot, itself, isn't all that impressive, but it is simple. Basically, illegal shipments of ecstacy are flowing into Miami.  The shipments spark wars between drug-dealers/gangs as they attempt to get hold of the ecstacy. TNT detectives Mike & Marcus have to put the pieces together by taking on these various drug-dealers I.D. the dealer & investigate the parlours of the drug-dealer in order to get sufficient evidence to put him away for good. Meanwhile, Marcus is really feeling the stress of being Mike's partner. Whereas Marcus prefers a bit more peaceful resolutions, Mike is the gun-totin' player.  Things are worsened between the two when Marcus finds out that Mike & Syd (Marcus' sister) are dating.  Geez, that wasn't too hard, was it?  I understood it all, during my first viewing.This movie is also HILARIOUS.  This is good, clean, yet sick humor... I like it.  I'm not some psycho, or some sick-minded individual, but this movie was pretty funny.  the people in my theatre laughed, so I'm not the only one. The humor is very well-placed, whether it'd be bickering between the two main leads, or your classic situational comedy (ie. a scene in the video store, where Marcus & Mike have a ""heart to heart"").  Some humor does seem out of place, but it is still REALLY funny (What Marcus & Mike do to Reggie is mean... but damn it, it's just so funny... what father DOESN'T feel like doing that to the guy who's mackin his daugher... I thought so :P). Marcus' fear of corpses from ""Bad Boys"" is referenced, here in Part II.  It's hilarious what he goes through at the morgue.  The laughs don't stop there, though.  They continue (very nicely) as Marcus tries to regain steadiness by taking a ""nice"" glass of water.  The results are hilarious, yet at the same time, help move the plot of trying to nail the villain.Even with all the humor, there is still some drama involved, especially concerning Mike & Marcus' dilemmas... it plays really well (especially the scenes following Marcus' discovery of Syd's kidnapping).Okay, people die, bullets are shot, cars crash, and CARS GO REALLY FAST!!!! Oh, my God, if I didn't know any better, I'd say it was an action movie... holy crap... it WAS an ACTION MOVIE!!!!  The action is just amazing.  The car scenes are visual eye-candy, and run nice and long.  Don't complain, because it's not like BBII is the only movie that does this.  This movie demonstrates how long car-chases SHOULD be.  Nice & long, & lots of destruction.  It's crazy.  The gun fights are really good, too.  I don't care what people say about Michael Bay, but he CAN direct.  The gun fight between Mike & Marcus and the Drug-Dealers in the house was AWESOME.  The spin around the rooms with Mike on side, and the dealers on the other is really creative.  It gives the viewer more of an interactive part in the fight, considering you witness the shots from various corners.  Of course, people die, and bullets go through heads, and blood pours... cry me a freakin' river!  This is an R-Rated movie and it warns  people about violence... plus the title,  ""BAD Boys II"" is a big giveaway.  You can't have a movie about Bad-ass cops and NOT HAVE something like that.  It is, in no way, IMMATURE to have something like that.  If anything, it's MATURE, since any 10 year-old would be freaked.  This is the big leagues; these are the Bad Boys.the Movie runs for 2 & a half hours.  Did i care?  Not really.  I was way too hyped over what was on the screen to care about what was on my watch.This review sounds like a ramble, but I LOVE THIS MOVIE.  I'm not some freak hyped up on caffine.  I had a great time at this movie.  This movie got blasted by critics, like hell.  This is, in no way, a big piece of art... It's a movie that appeals to all the bad-ass, easy-going, fun-loving ways of the movie goer.  It delivers: Action, Comedy, Sexy Women, Funny Guy, & a Bad-Ass Fresh Prince.  It's great.I love ""Bad Boys II.""  :)",Bad Boys II

That being said this sequel was worth the 8 year wait. It surpassed the original in every aspect. The action was much better and not over the top like others are claiming. This one was much funnier than the first. Martin really stole the show with his comedy in this one. The story was what you would or should expect from a summer action blockbuster. I get tired of reading reviews on here about people knocking movies like this cause the story is not an Oscar worthy screenplay. I mean did you really expect that going in to it? Did you see the first one? I respect others opinions dont get me wrong it is just that you have to go into a movie in the right frame of mind in order to enjoy it. This is not a movie that causes the audience to think alot which is fine. If you spend the entire two and a half hours over analyzing the movie for all the unrealistic things then of course you are not going to enjoy it. It is a movie for goodness sake. They never say that the film is based on a true story or actual events. If you are unable to suspend reality for a few hours and just enjoy a movie then dont waste your time or money and then come on here and cry about it. This movie is one of the best movies I have seen this year. It has something for everyone. I would like to see a Bad Boys 3 if they treat it like they did this one. They dont need to rush and throw one together so it can be out in a year or two but Will and Martin have an undeniable chemistry together and this movie series are both of these actors best work.

Anyway, shallow action movies, full of gratuitous violence, overdone explosions and tasteless one-liners is exactly my kind of entertainment. Usually. But in this case, it didn't work, it didn't entertain, it was just a series of graphical highlights with not much to connect them.Maybe it a less than brilliant idea to re-do a Black version of Miami Vice in the 2000s, applying a thick layer of stereotypes and string together an endless series of scenes targeted at the tastes of a similarly stereotypical Black demographic or whatever the director assumes about them.Expect the full range of action flick stereotypes: heroes with a lifestyle light years above the average income of any real policeman, policemen driving Ferraris on duty, policemen immune to bullets, policemen that can do everything, everywhere, in record time. Then lace it with stereotypical Black stereotypes and you're set: have them kill a few KKK members, let them wear Basketball shirts all the time, focus on every girl's booty and have some minutes of screen time for literal truckloads of money.In short: the classic ingredients of any run-of-the-mill rap video, just extended for what feels like 2 hours and then some.",Bad Boys II

In this sequel Micheal Bay's 1995 hit Bad Boys, Lawerence and Smith are back again, this time trying to stop E smugglers.  Sound simple?  Well, it is, but it has a great time being simple.  It's obvious the two stars had a great time making the movie which comes through on the screen.  This is also a big change for both of the movie's stars, being that Will Smith is in a much more violent role and Martin Lawerence is in a watchable role.

Also, there was a healthy dose of comedy which I wasn't expecting. This is the type of movie critics hate, but the rest of us normal people love. To start the plot was  fairley inane; But it was strong enough to pull the audience into the next action sequence. Warning spoilers ahead. The pair of narcotics cops end up working on the Tactical Narcotics Team(TNT). They try to stop a drug lord who is polluting the streets with ecstacy. working undercover for the drug lord is Marcus's sister:she gets kidnaped(big suprise),so it's up to Mike and Marcus to rescue her. That just enough plot for the action to commense. There is a freeway chase thet blows the Matrix away: almost littorally. Micheal Bay does a phenomenal job with the chase. Say what you will about Bay, but he does the best action sequences in the movie business. He manages to load the movie with explosions and gun fights. Also, there are comedy bits that make you hold you stomace you are laughing so much. Marcus accidentlly taking ecetacy is one of the funniest bits in the film.

I am not a Michael Bay fan, but Bad Boys 2 is my favourite Bayhem film (Pain and Gain being the number two). Bay is known not for his storytelling, but for 'action-sense' or 'Bayhem' .. and Bad Boys 2 proves that he is one of the best in the business.The film follows the story of two partner cops who are on a trail of drug traffickers in Miami. From Will Smith, to Martin Lawrence and Peter Stormare, this film has got stock of great actors, but again, this film is not much about acting.Bad Boys 2 delivers some of the best shot action sequence till date. Amir Mokri (DOP) is magical with his work. Every gunshot and explosion seems right in your face, along with what can be called THE best car chase in the history of action films. Technically, Bad Boys 2 was way ahead of its time. Some might disagree but I miss this kind of production in today's age. Hence, Bad Boys 2 is like a bookmark for me in my movie watching timeline.Conclusion: Don't miss this film, if you are an action film buff!

348,jake7026,Action and Comedy rolled into 1,8,13 February 2005,"Will Smith and Martin Lawrence play Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett, two cops who investigate the smuggling of Ecstacy into Florida. Both play their characters really well. The action scenes in the film are good and the action is of high quality but there are just a few too many. If the film had been been shortened by probably 30 minutes and not dragged out so long it would have made a bigger impression. Other than that the are no other major faults. The scene at the start with the night-clubbers giving each other Ecstasy could probably have been cut and the blood and gore were a bit over the top. The scenes where Marcus and Mike bag out the kid who comes to pick up his daughter and when they chase after the van with the bodies in the back were both funny. The car chase scene involving Marcus' sister was probably the best scene in the movie because of the great action, camera angles and the fact that it was funny. I think that Bad Boys II is better than the first and should be seen by anyone who likes great action movies.Overall - 8/10",Bad Boys II
349,angryrupert,Really cool,4,5 April 2008,"Will smith is really cool, this film is cool because of his real skills. He should be called 'real' smith, because his performance is bang on. The other chap is entertaining but a real bad man. I don't like him and i think he should leave this film. I have this on VHS and i tried to tape over every section featuring the Martin Lawrence chap in it, i tried to show this to my kids, but they didn't know what was happening?! I enjoyed it though, i felt without the Martin guy it was a superior film, but a bit illogical?! But i'm babbling.Overall its a fun film with a big action explosion, and features some witty dialogues, but not witty enough i say! Give me real smith's role in this film any day, but get rid of the rest i say, real stinker.I conclude that this movie is riddled with holes like martin Clarence should be.",Bad Boys II
350,NineDarter,OTT...and I love it,7,27 June 2006,"This movie has no finesse, no intricately laid out plot, just lots and lots of guns, explosions, crashes, insane chases and actors who clearly know how over the top this film is and just hang on to the ride.The villain is clearly a few screws loose and slightly clichéd. The whole chief being in therapy and immersing himself in Feng Shui is really funny. The partnership of Smith and Lawrence is slightly less good than the first but is still hilarious.As I said before, this movie goes OTT and the actors follow suit.This is a pure pop corn movie, it doesn't need a brain surgeon to follow the plot, it relies on explosions, action and comedy to carry the viewer through the movie and pulls it off in very good fashion.Just sit back, relax, get the beers in and turn the volume up..this is a film to mindlessly enjoy!!!",Bad Boys II
351,basquewitch_70,Yuck,1,20 August 2003,"First off let me say Im a huge fan of the original. Im not easily upset by gore, profanity, or even sometimes downright stupidity in a plot line. I dont hate Michael Bay or Bruckheimer. But this movie just sucked. The plot line was ok but all the things that made the first movie great is nonexistent in the second.Will Smith's character.. what the hell happened?? The smooth charming guy, has turned into a nasty foul mouthed jerk who treats his best friend like crap and shoots everything and everyone who crosses his path.Women are at the low rung of the ladder in this movie. While Union's character starts out with some strength, she ends up disappearing for a huge chunk of the movie only to show up at the end... needing to be rescued. Even Lawrence's wife is toned down from the women she used to be. Will Smith's character refers to a female corpse(a person who he never knew) as a bimbo. The women in this movie are all hookers, airheads or corpses. Oh wait, i forgot the strippers.The gore... all i can say is yuck. I have no problem with some gratuitous violence in an r rated movie, but hell, enough is enough. The movie is 150 minutes long because for some reason Bay thought we wanted to see every person who died being blown apart in slow motion. And seeing the body parts with blood dripping from them 4 or 5 times for the same scene is just lame.Some jokes were funny, most just died. My love for the rapport in the first one between the leads, in the sequel becomes annoying and long winded.The scary thing is the best thing about this movie is Martin Lawrence trying to come to terms and understand why his best friend has turned into a psychotic killer and a d**k. Which pretty much defines the biggest mistake the movie made.Its sad, if they had just edited some junk and left Smith's character the way he was in the original they may have had a decent movie.",Bad Boys II
352,jpspero,"So bad it's.. well, bad (SOME SPOILERS AHEAD)",1,9 December 2003,"If you have had the misfortune of sitting through this movie, you'll know what I mean: when most of the movie's 'jokes' come from the gratuitous exploitation of corpses, and it climaxes with an invasion of Cuba by a dozen men, you certainly get the feeling it's been a wasted few hours. (By the way, how did they manage to fill such a long time with such a paucity of material? The movie went on ffffffooooooooooorrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeevvvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrr.)It's not fair to say that I can't appreciate - or even just tolerate - a good action movie - Terminator still rules, once you turn your brain off and go into neutral. (Tho' I suspect that some of this movie's popularity may stem from most of its admirers never coming out of neutral.) An attempt at a buddy-buddy movie ('We ride together. We die together') comes off as way too forced, when the leads seem barely to be able to stand one another. If I were Will Smith's partner, I wouldn't leave (as Lawrence wants to), I'd rather kill him and go to jail - he's remarkably awful in every aspect. Mawkish and forced their friendship comes across, and Smith is a boor.The plot challenges the extremities of your suspension of disbelief, and inspires such elevated scenes as 'guy murdered and shoved into barrel' and - may Bruckheimer and Bay be forgiven! - rats having sex. Could anything be funnier? The answer, clearly, is yes, anything could be funnier. Except, perhaps, for the rest of the movie. Drifting from one sordid and stupid situation to another with the only constant being gunfire (oh, and bad acting, horrendous writing, terrible direction and appalling production).I - for the first time ever - actually want to commit physical violence against all those involved in this movie, from the moronic scriptwriter to those who couldn't act their way out of a paper bag.Enjoy!",Bad Boys II

This is easily one of if not my favorite movie of all time, and Michael Bay did a spectacular job on it. The action in the movie is unlike any movie, the only movie I've seen with better action was another Michael bay movie and that was transformers. Bad boys 2 is great all around, great action, great acting, great music, and amazing cars. The movie is very entertaining, it goes back and forth between action and comedy all the way through.

At times, you were thinking that the movie was about to end, and suddenly, another situation occurs and another hour and a half goes by. Then, you were thinking that it had to be over, and, what do you know, another think occurs and the movie continues.  Even when the credits appeared, there was still a little 3 minute continuation of the movie.  To sum it up, the movie was average, but had terrible acting (what do you expect?), and was way to long. Bring you lots and lots of coke and popcorn because you are in for a long one.",Bad Boys II
359,da_wogfather,Are the boys badder than before?,7,20 September 2003,"I saw Bad Boys 2 this Thursday on the opening day and was literally blown away by all the explosions and gunshots. It looks like Michael Bay decided to step up a few hundred notches for this film, with the increased amount of explosions, dead bodies, blood & gore and swearing this film actually started to look like an American action movie. The original was classic, with some of the best one-liners about having picnics in cars and borrowing brown sugar, but Bad Boys 2 attempted to recycle a lot of the original glory, which was painstakingly obvious. When I see a film I like to get into the moment, suspend disbelief and pretend the film is actually happening, but the ""reality"" of this film is extinguished when the two Miami cops staring down a barrel start singing to their enemies trying to mimic the moments that worked so well in the first film. Despite the recycling which seems to be inevitable in pretty much all sequals, Michael Bay did a very good job. The film was action packed, some of the new characters worked well (swap a french criminal with a latino drug lord, nobody seems to notice) and they kept enough of the originals to actually make it look like it was the same people in the storyline. Tea` Leoni, how hot she may be, did annoy the hell out of me in the original, so I was glad to see her go (or not see her for that matter),the only other downside was getting rid of Chet the doorman played by Saverio Guerra...he bought such light to Bad Boys 1...he will be missed...Anyway, 8 years in the making, a BIG budget, excellent talent in front of and behind the camera has made Bad Boys 2 quite entertaining...excuse me if I didn't find the deep down message from this film, I was too busy watching things blow up!~Tonyz (Melbourne Australia)~",Bad Boys II
360,jedi4049,great action flick,8,22 July 2003,"I came in expecting a great action flick and i was soooooooo satisfied. this movie was awesome. all the action was mostly with real cars and everything was flashy. bad boys 1 was one of my favorite action movies and this was 2 times better. some people are reviewing this movie very unfairly and knocking on the humor. bad boys is all about humor. the rat scene was funny to me. the other scene where they threaten the 15 yr old kid was the funniest. if you arent into the genre of die hard, lethal weapon, or rush hour, dont see this. if you like good entertainment you'll get your money's worth here. the only gripe i had about this movie is that martin lawrence still hasnt gotten his chubby ass in shape. another gripe is that they could have brought that great bad boys 1 music. that theme music they used throughout the 1st movie was awesome. this movie sorta played that ""shake a tail feather"" toooooooo much! besides those flaws this movie gets 9/10another thing is you shouldnt worry about the movie's length. it goes by fast because its so good.",Bad Boys II

362,stinkehund,Wu-yah!,9,6 September 2003,"What can I say. This movie absolutely blew me away. I mean, I expected an action movie but this went way over my expectations. I joked with my friend before the movie started, how Michael Bay is the king of explosions. Let me tell you - he outdid himself this time. He's practically made it into an art form in this one. Hello! The action sequences are so up tempo, high energy, that all I could do, was just sit there and release some ""Whoa's!"" and a lot of laughs with frequent intervals. In my opinion, this is the best action movie so far in 2003. Heck - best one this century even. And that is with Reloaded and T3 fresh in mind - which I loved. But the Hummer scene for instance had my jaw on the floor! Now that's how to shoot a car chase. Outstanding!On a pondering note, I gave this movie a 9, but I saw that almost as many people gave the movie a 1 rating as people gave it a 9. I realize that taste is different, but 1?? In my opinion you have to rate a movie for what it's for. You won't see intricate dialog or life changing philosophical questions argued too much in this movie. It's an action movie!

But what impressed me most is how the movie changes tone so much - one moment it's a high comedy, then a touching buddy movie, then a violent crime caper with truly vile Miami drugs lords, then a farce which goes right to the limits of bad taste, then a fully-fledged commando action flick...it never draws breath. In theory it should have been all over the place but the whole thing somehow hangs together brilliantly. It's also laugh out loud funny a great deal of the time (Will Smith/Martin Lawrence superb). I think it's radical. You have to hand it to Bruckheimer, this kind of thing is much harder to do than it looks.",Bad Boys II

BBII fits the bill. The team of Lawrence and Smith once again are the best cop comic team in the business today. The action in this movie was off the charts.

I mean that made the movie even more drawn out then it had to be. And Martin Lawrence is not funny, I mean how many times can the guy say f*** and still have it be funny.

Be sure to go to the restroom before starting this film because you won't want to leave it at any point. There are two really great chase scenes in this movie that has some new stunts I've never seen in any other movies before. Camera angles and camera usage in this movie are great also. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are a great team and click very well together. We both liked this sequel better than the first and we thought it was pretty good.

Besides the great camera work, there are some good new ideas (like throwing with cars), even though it is the ususal good-cops-agains-evil-drug-dealer-story. Still the film is much too long (2 hours, 17 minutes) for an action movie, they could have easily used the last part of the story for Bad Boys 3.And why did they have to throw around bodies?",Bad Boys II

I thought maybe it was a bit long for an action movie, and the ending was a bit poor. For me a movie has to have a bit of realism and the fact that they're standing outside a US naval base shooting people and no-one takes them out is a bit unbelievable and spoilt the film slightly.
Overall: it's a film that you can sit down to after a hard day of work and just let gloss over you.",Bad Boys II

Its really exciting when they get into Tapia's mansion, in Cuba.That's the best scene in the movie, they built tunnels, they use incredible weapons and really cool tactics.

The sequel to an entertaining action hit (Bad Boys) takes all the negative elements from the first one and capitalizes on none of the positive. This must be one of the most violent, insensitive and immoral films made by Hollywood in the past 10 years. Violent, insensitive and immoral can be very entertaining but when it's also crude, unoriginal and boring, the level of insult and disgust rises considerably. Both the story line and characters are undeveloped and seriously lacking in even the potential to be interesting. Will Smith, contrary to his usual clean image, comes across as a brutal, ignorant animal and that probably sums up the film. The glamour and righteousness with with the killing of both guilty and innocent people is undertaken is truly shocking. If you want blood, gore, and special effects, although they're there in abundance, 'Bad Boys 2' will leave you feeling empty and unsatisfied.

I, most personally, LOVE this movie because it has GREAT action and GREAT stunts. One part in this movie that is my favourite is when Mike and Marcus are finding out clues about the Ecstasy case with Tapia in a camera store...and when the owner flips a camera switch, he and the whole store watch Mike and Marcus talk about Marcus' problems (along with a problem about Marcus' erection and other things).

Johnny Tapia is smuggling ecstasy and money to Cuba in dead bodies while Mike and Marcus are trying to figure the drug circle out. However, Mike is secretly involved in the D.E.A., which leads t Syd's kidnapping by Johnny Tapia. This all leads to Mike and Marcus completing the case and rescuing Syd in Cuba.Director Michael Bay caught the attention of his viewers with this funny yet serious flick. The movie is rated ""R"" due to language, violence, and brief nudity. Once on a trail, Mike and Marcus find a way to cope to get through their struggles. This action packed film keeps the viewers laughing and on the edge of their seats.Stunts are unbelievable realistically, however not that common. Camera angles are fulfilling to every shot that is to be seen. A good flow articulates the movie to run smoothly. Mike is a top notch dresser compared to Marcus who dresses more casual. Bodies used as mules to smuggle ecstasy into Cuba had a realistic touch. The dialogue was sometimes bitter however was fitting to the movie.",Bad Boys II

381,Druffmaul,I finally seen Bad Boys II (sic),5,1 July 2017,"Never saw either of the Bad Boys movies until relatively recently. A few years ago my curiosity was ~slightly~ piqued when I saw Hot Fuzz and one of the characters kept asking ""You ain't seen Bad Boys II???"" Soon afterward I ended up buying the blu-ray double pack, watched the first Bad Boys, and enjoyed it well enough I suppose. I had every intention of following up with Bad Boys II, but somehow the motivation to sit down and watch it simply never manifested and it's been collecting dust ever since. The other day I saw a video of Henry Rollins telling a long, rambling and hilarious story about him going to a disastrous movie audition, with the surprise twist that he actually somehow managed to land the part... revealing at the very end of the story that the movie in question was in fact Bad Boys II. For whatever reason, that made me go to my backlog bin of un- watched (often unopened) DVDs and blu-rays and rummaged through it until I found Bad Boys II, and I finally watched it last night. Not a whole lot to say, really. I generally don't buy into the Michael Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer bashing that's been going on for the last 15 years or so, and I guess I expected more. I thought it was a painfully unoriginal and dull movie, despite all of the car chases, shootouts, and explosions. Why did I think it would be more than a retread of countless cop/buddy movies that had preceded it for 20 years (e.g. 24 Hrs.)? It did have a few genuinely hilarious moments, but at this point I'm assuming that the ""fawning homage"" in Hot Fuzz was purely sarcastic and I was an idiot for not realizing that until now.",Bad Boys II

Firstly, they are not playing to be 'hereos' they are normal human cops who are seriously cheesed off about this drug dealer, who is, indeed, very very dangerous. When they searched the corpses in the mortuary they HAD to do it in order to get the evidence. They never said they were proud.Sure, a couple of tasteless jokes were made, yes, but this is actually human nature. Have you people never made a comment about somebody or someone without really thinking about it, then feeling guilty afterwards? That is what was happening here, and in context they don't really care since they throw away their job and concentrate on getting their man. It's the same as any police officer. It's the same as a officer punching the heck out of a murderer they couldn't catch out of frustration.Again, same with driving through that mini village. They were trying to catch a mass murderer, drug dealer, and all around nasty piece of work. YES, it IS tasteless, wrong, and out of order, let along something they should have been fired and arrested for.

Many complain about the excessive gore, or the fact that it ends a little under 2 1/2 hours.  With all of this in mind, I went to see it anyway.  While I do agree the gore is a little TOO much, the movie is paced perfectly.  It isn't too long or too short and allows the viewer to really connect with the characters and whats going on on-screen.  Both my friend, everyone in the theater around us and I all seemed to enjoy the movie, which is most important.  I give it *** out of **** for an exciting and sometimes funny movie.",Bad Boys II
386,lavos222,"Yeah, ok, it's mindless action, but so what?",9,23 July 2003,"Please, please PLEASE do not go into this movie expecting complex plot mechanics, a life changing message or a good time for the family. Bad Boys II is a top-notch, hilarious, action-packed, testosterone-inducing experience, and nothing more. I could say it's for the guys, but that would be sexist, so you can figure out what I mean. It's loud and filled with profanity, but the action scenes are superb, and there are some truly funny moments in it too. It felt a bit long, but it looked fantastic thanks to a CGI shot count of 0. In summary, if you want a seriously fun time without the message, go see this movie. It's definately worth your $9. (as in see it on a BIG screen)",Bad Boys II
387,Penquin,Great Entertainment,10,17 July 2003,"I really enjoyed the first movie and was excited to see the second. I was not disappointed. I found this movie way better than the first. Storyline was not bad. Some of the scenes were just histerical. I laughed all the time. I am not a Martin Lawrence fan but really did find him funny. Will Smith was great. But then again, he is Will Smith. I did wish that Tea Leoni was in this one but Union did very well. There are some terrific one liners that I have been using today. This will be a ""must see again"" for me and will be purchasing a DVD when it comes out.",Bad Boys II
388,lysamiller,Embarrassing,2,24 July 2003,"This was an awful film, too gratuitously violent for any but the most ardent devotees of M-rated video games. I was actually embarrassed to be sitting in the theater watching it, and was extremely conscious of the numerous children in the audience of this gore- packed, sexist, rated R movie - parents had brought offspring aged from about 2 months to 14 years, with almost every age group in between well-represented. Plotless, pointless, and utterly tasteless.",Bad Boys II
389,spfxman,"""The THX trailer logo had a more believable plot""",3,5 December 2003,"As Bill Maher said on his show 'Real Time', and I quote ""I went to see Bad Boys 2, and the THX trailer logo had a more believable plot."" I could not agree more. In fact, I don't think there could be a wittier remark about such hideous film-making. 'BB 2' to put it simply is not a film; it's a montage of stylized noise and explosions.Michael Bay (the director) is a distinctive filmmaker who I've had mixed thoughts about. But after viewing this abomination I think Bay can be uniquely talented, but he also be uniquely patronizing to the audience. His movies have no authentic characters and no story. His films are nothing but action orientated situations, from an over the top A.D.D. imagination. Bay tends to downplay character, and exposition to such a small serving that only a four year old would consider it legitimate storytelling.As for the action sequences, I admired some of the camera work, but they go on too long. One car chase has a running time of about ten minutes with so much repetitiveness, that it's hard to believe there are more car chases to come. And the time fillers that take place between the action are useless. There just in the movie to give us mandatory character insight so the movie has a feature length running time. Smith and Lawrence do what they can with the humor, but the humor is so bad and vulgar that it's hard to even think about laughing.So here's some advice to Michael Bay. Try to be more intelligent and more creative with your next film. It's the only way you can gain more respect in the film industry. Lord knows you need it. You're on the fast track to becoming a successful version of Ed Wood. And here's a quick memo to Mr. Bruckheimer (the producer.) Now that you've had a good run and made a lot of money, maybe its time you head back to Middle America. To put it rather honestly you're not a filmmaker you're a businessman. A businessman who overuses film motifs that appeals to Middle Americans to produce maximum box office returns. There are reasons critics loath your Middle-American touch. You have a tendency to be too sentimental and too abridging in your work. Your films are reflections of what the market research says, not what your passionate creative impulse says. And for that, I fear you maybe turning the cinema into a dump of schlock, YIKES!!!!!!!!!!!!. Don't even think about it.",Bad Boys II
390,robscutt,More kick ass antics from those crazy cops!!,9,16 July 2003,"What more can I say, saw a preview of this film, and it is more of the same.

And better, wildly FUNNY. It's a 120-beat-per-minute, 120-laugh-per-hour rollicking episode. It's been a while since I saw a whole theatre doubled over in laughter. Martin and Smith are beyond awesome; *way, way*, better than in the original. The car chase scenes were very deliberately over-the-top but I found them far more C""redible"" (to use the word losely : ) than the famously tedious one from Matrix 2.I serously hope that there will be a Bad Boys 3 and that we don't have to wait 8 years to enjoy it.",Bad Boys II

This movie has that as well as great plot, even though if you turn away at certain points its easy to lose whats happening. This is by far a 'lads' film, it has everything, (lots of) action, comedy, special effects even a nice subtle emotional side to it which most guys will appreciate when I say the phrase:-""We Ride Together, We Die Together, Bad Boys For Life"". The 1st film was good but by no means as good as this. Watch it. I hope other movies take a leaf out this film",Bad Boys II
393,roguesoldier,BEST SUMMER MOVIE,10,15 July 2003,"Last night I was fortunate enough to get passes to see an advance screening of BB2.  I was looking forward to seeing this for a long time.  I was heavily hyped (not a good thing).  Well was it worth it?  You damn right it was!  I couldn't believe the scope of the picture, it makes BB1 like a Fresh Prince/Martin episode.  Minus salaries, it looked like dollar for dollar the budget was onscreen.  It was a great adrenaline rush, I was tense, my arm was been twitching the fist half of the movie alone.  I must have swallowed my tongue several times.  About the running time, I didn't even think twice to check my watch.  Not counting the quick plot set-up at the beginning, the movie catapults forward and never stops.  The freeway chase smokes the Matrix Reloaded, gunfights galore, bullets in the head, blood flying, bodies being blown up and dismembered, dead bodies being smashed up, hot women in water-drenched clubs, endless cussing to make you blush, a Ferrari in gunfights at high-speeds, Jesus what else?!.  Oh, a Hummer on a warpath through Cuba.   From the title sequence alone I knew this was the one. What was a good break between the action was the comedic relief, I swear I almost fell out of my chair, it was hurting to laugh after a while.  The cast was great.  Will Smith was bad-ass along with Martin.  I can't even remember all the action sequences.  I really don't want to give away anything to the fans, picture this, its roller coaster ride that flies off the track and nosedives into the ground at mach 3.  The finale outdates the Rock easily. This is the perfect summer movie, with a R-rating proving these movies still can be made if done properly.  I'd give it a 9.5/10.  Why knock down a notch?  Well, I was disappointed that the Mark Mancina Bad Boys theme wasn't even present.  Don't get me wrong Dre and Trevor Rabin (which I love) was good, reminiscent of Black Hawk Down, but no real theme music.  Oh well. Can't have everything I guess.   For the action fans, Bad Boy fans, Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay fans and people who want a good summer popcorn movie, here it is. People who want to see this fail or have nothing better to than bitch and complain about this type of film making, stay home and catch rerun of Frasier because if you see this you'll never admit the truth about this movie. Guaranteed I'll be back in line to see this on 07.18.03",Bad Boys II
394,Ordaw,"Yeah, its the sequel. Wanna make something of it?",8,18 July 2003,"Bad Boys II is just that.  The second in the series, and like its predecessor, it has plenty of explosions, car chases and guns galore. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence do their jobs well, just like in the first one. The story line in this one seemed a little looser than the first, but then again, how many gun fights can you have with a really accurate script? Like most sequels, this one does not measure up to the first, but it comes close. Really, if you liked the first one, you'll like this one.",Bad Boys II

Martin and Will had mad chemistry...This movie goes down as a must see film...It is well rounded action pack with a little romance, sexy (to all sexes), funny (you will laugh), witty, class and intelligence/under world genius.

396,duncan691,"This movie is Brilliant,Go watch it!!!",10,29 July 2003,"First of all i don't understand why everyone is complaining about the violence & strong language in a film like this. The rating alone should give you the idea that this is not for the Barney (you know the purple dinosaur) lovers of the world. If violence & strong language offend you in films, change genre (action,in case you not certain,i mean you need an IQ to understand complicated words) & stop complaining about films that use it as means of entertainment. I mean the good guys kill the bad guys,does this not prove that good conquers evil. The story is pretty basic,cops fight the bad guys & in the end they win.Clap clap!!!we all go home. The comedy mix in this film is brilliant, just as the case with its predecessor. The performances are by no means worthy of Oscars,but they are believable. This movie reminds me of what movies were made for in the first place. To entertain the target audience & keep them coming back for more. If you didnt enjoy this movie,it is obvious you don't fall part of the target audience,so don't come back for more,i am sure there should be a Pauly Shore movie showing somewhere near you and that should keep you entertained till the crack of dawn. Step aside Matrix: Reloaded with its overdone visual fx and your over-the-top & stupid story & even worse performances,this films chase scene is by far better & more believable & as a film it is leagues ahead of whatever game the Matrix wanted to play. This is the definitive movie of the Summer,Fun,Fun,Fun,Fun,Fun.Oh yes i forgot to mention that this movie is Fun.Its so nice to watch a movie where you don't need a Masters Degree in Film Study to understand what is going on & still be entertained. Go watch this now!!!",Bad Boys II
397,Dexster,Great Flick,9,10 October 2003,Watched this while I was deployed in Bishkek. This movie had me laughing non-stop. The lines between Martin / Will are priceless.

It met every one of my expectations and blew some of them completely out of the water.The action scenes were amazing, except for some strange camera work that made the chase scenes a bit hard to follow. The way Marcus and Mike interact with each other is what makes the film great in my view. They have a great chemistry, the way that they deal/fight with each other is what makes them the funniest cop duo ever.The final scene where the two of them are sitting on the double raft as the pool breaks was one of the best scenes in the movie for me, because it shows their perfect chemistry together.I anxiously await the third Bad Boys.",Bad Boys II

And Michael Bay is in his prime.  I would say that the movie might have been too long but since I loved every minute of it I won't.  This has the potential to be my favorite action franchise, beating Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, Bevrely Hills Cop, and Rush Hour, if they do a third one. Anyone who didn't like this movie probably doesn't like the genre and should not have seen it.  But if you're into a straight up action movie (not that much CGI) with a lot of laughs, this is your movie.

What was up with all the gay jokes in this movie.  This movie is the typical 'cop' movie but it does not compete with 'Lethal weapon.'  So, bad jokes and bad script.  The action on the other hand was good.  The whole scene on the highway was intense..u know the edge of ur seat kinda thing.  So, if u like corny action go c it.

These two talented actors took the easy way out -- 8 years between BOYS 1 and BOYS 2 - isn't long enough. Teenage boys who love SHOOT-EM-UPS / BLOW-EM-UPS might like it -- or somebody who's been hitting the pipe, but it didn't work for me. This film was mindless, over-kill, too long, too loud, obnoxious, and punctuated by all the EXPLOSIONS. Even the slim subplots were silly -- OOOOO, Cuban Drug dealers, where did they come up with that great, fresh idea -- Johnnie Cockran's defense of OJ ?? The chase scenes have been done over and over......French Connection did it better but that was 32 YEARS AGO -- or do BIGGER and MORE EXPLOSIONS automatically mean that it's better ? I don't think so, but what do I know, I'm a mature adult !! Disappointed, you bet !! I LOVE Will Smith, when he picks GOOD projects. What's next for Will Smith, Ali or Wild Wild.....never mind. Martin's stunk it up in the past as well, but with MAMA, he HAD returned to silly, but VERY entertaining movie making !! These rehash, buddy, cop movies that trys to blow-up more things and people than the last movie has gotten old, and INSULTING !! But again, that's just me.

Sure there were a few laughs and sure there were lots of stunts, but seeing this movie made me realize that the producer/director/writer don't have a clue why the first movie was a success. Apparently, it was sheer dumb luck on their part.What little plot there is in BBII is absurd...invading Cuba???? Will Smith's character is the over the edge bad cop, so Martin Lawrence has to work for the laughs. There is a great deal of action, but it is very mean spirited and graphic to the point of nausea.The original was a success due to the humor, the bonding of the characters and some well timed action. This movis is a miserable follow-up with little true humor, characters that constantly harp at each other, and continual action with no real point.",Bad Boys II

I am not only one of the most critical people I know when it comes to movies but I'm also not a Michael Bay fan. Oh My God!!! Most action films now-a-days are just ho-hum and use warmed over effects and stunts from other films, but this one pulls out all the stops. When I first saw the ads for this film last year, I said to myself, ""Why are they making a sequel to that film?"" Not only that, but why did they wait 8 years to make it. Needless to say, I didn't have much faith in this film. The underwhelming trailers didn't help either. Boy, was I wrong. This was the summer film I didn't know I wanted to see. Most action films are mere spectacle, but I actually felt this one in my gut. None of the sequences give up one inch of slack. This film is on major steroids. Oh...and did I mention the comedy? The exchanges between Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are completely raw and off the chain. I don't even like Martin Lawrence!!! This had to be one expensive movie, especially at 2.5 hours long. I was so pumped up after leaving the theater that when I got home I immediately put on some Slayer. This film is that good. This is by no means an Oscar winner, but who cares.Forget the Matrix Reloaded, Terminator 3, The Hulk, and all those other weak imitators.

Yes its a bit gory at times, yes there is cursing, yes there is drugs, yes there is adult themes, HELLO ?? What did you expect ??? You have to have a decent grip on reality to be able to appreciate this movie and not take it too seriously. Are some of the scenes over the top and unbelievable? Heck yes they are, its an action MOVIE, not real life but man let me tell you this movie delivers action and comedy in spades !! The rapport between M. Short and W. Smith was done very well and I personally could understand where both of them were coming from in there differences of opinion. I did not think their banter was overdone and I did not think the movie was too long. If your enjoying a movie don't you want to see it just go on and on? I do, much like I did with both of the LOTR movies which are long also. I'm telling you now if you understand you are going in to see an action MOVIE and don't try and take it too seriously you will have a BLAST at Bad Boys II !!

The stupid humor, the endless action and that was absoloutely heart beating and the audience cracked up. Will Smith and Martin Laurence are exceptional actors and their contrasting physical apperance and attitude makes them an excellent team.
This movie was great all around except the dead bodies got a bit too excessive, there just wasn't a need for so many and the thought of hiding ecstacy in dead bodies really made a new line for how low humans can journey in disturbing thoughs. Martin Lawrence sleeping with that dead girl was very disturbing. Otherwise the movie was pretty good up the part where they went to Cuba, that was just going beyond being New York police officers that is a mass army operation and they found all the links to help them catch the baddie.. wow what a conincidence.But otherwise 8/10 for me, action and humor was incredible.",Bad Boys II

I don`nt know why some critics say bad things about this movie (they`re probably MAGNOLIA fans) because there is non-stop action. This is not one of those action movies where there are 10 minutes of action and than we have to wait for the last scene to see some action, no, Bad Boys 2 is one of the best sequels. The director Michael Bay makes a very good comeback after the disapoiting PEARL HARBOR he is one of the best directors of action movies there is no doubt about it and there is the big contribution of the best action/comedy actors there is. Will Smith & Martin Lawrence = 100% of pure fun!!!",Bad Boys II
424,nighthawkiller-1,CRAP!,2,19 October 2003,"I've nothing more to say that this is THE awful movie of the year.. it is a great disappointment.i expected more than ""bang bang""sex sex"" on Bruckeimer' and Bay's Films.nothing more than a great insult of who might like hip hop groups and just a reenforcement on what ""hip hop"" means for high class society:Crap Cya.Nighthawk. France;Paris.",Bad Boys II
425,fotogg,2nd worst film I saw in the last year.,1,5 January 2004,"I wanted to walk out on this movie, but it was showing in my living room. Actually, I did walk out, to use the bathroom. My wife asked if I wanted to pause the playback and I told her there was no need.What chemistry and humor there was in the first movie is forced in this one. And for such a flimsy premise as this, why was it so long?Just way overdone and a waste of everyone's creative energy.",Bad Boys II
426,badboy4life67,An absolutely great film with heart-pounding action.,9,30 December 2003,"I was amazed at the over-the-edge action scenes in this film.I thought the car dropping scene and the Hummer going through the shacks were both fabulous scenes. I also liked the way they mixed comedy with extreme action.Martin Lawrence and Will Smith play great roles in this action-packed ride.This was more funny and a lot more action-packed than the first was.Now,yes it does have its weaknesses including the length,but if you love action movies this is definetly the movie for you.",Bad Boys II
427,mhemsing,Pure Garbage,1,24 January 2004,Violence = appalling Humor = non-existentCheck your brain at the door for this one!  This movie is a nice commentary on just how far Hollywood has come.  You'll feel as though you just left a two and a half hour junk food buffet. That's right- I said two and a half hours! It's like watching 5 episodes of a bad tv series in a row.Anyone involved with film should be embarrassed and ashamed!,Bad Boys II
428,SSGTCWATCH,Great Show,9,16 February 2004,"I felt that BB2 was better than the original.  BB2 kept you going, the edge of your seat, wanting more and more.  Smith and Lawrence excel and provide plenty of action tied in with comedy.  I would give this one 9/10 compared to the 5/10 I would give for the original.",Bad Boys II
429,ulfbeckman,"Wow, the worst i've seen this millennium",1,28 September 2006,"What a crap...2 police-Negroids trying to be funny and awesome. And the music in the movie!!! Its hard rock all the time, just to be hefty...i say it again, wow....and the scene in the beginning with the KKK. Of course they must have a scene like that when it is two Negroids in the movie...I'm no racist, but this is too much. You start to wonder why...I cant get it, who really like this movies. Have that people ever been on a cinema......? You really start to wonder. Michael Bay has made two good movies, and that is The Rock and Armageddon. This is just one good joke that doesn't fulfill nothing at all. The whole story just runs on track like a train. No meaning, no sub-content, no nothing. See something else.",Bad Boys II
430,sungod666,Worth every minute and every cents,10,30 May 2004,"For all those who think poorly of this movie, my advice to you is to get a life. Big budget production that only have the word entertainment in their objective is a must have in Hollywood. It is bad enough we have people like terry gillian that torture the average film goer with his idealistic crap and boring movies than we have all those award winner and wannabe churning out movie after movie that seek to invoke rather than entertain. The exception is of course lord of the rings series which is extremely entertaining even for the laymen who do not know an ogre from a human. Bad boys 2 give the movie industry a reminder that producer need to focus on their core objectives. To Entertain!",Bad Boys II
431,Willcra,Wow,10,20 January 2007,"Action / Drama / Comedy all rolled into oneBad Boys I & II are best action packed movies of their time, I can watch it over and over (and have). The combination of Will Smith and Martin Lawrence is superb... Great mix of Comedy, Action and Drama, the stuff action movies are meant to be.When you buy/rent this movie be prepared to sit on the edge of your set and be Wowed. The special effects are incredible. I'm hoping that Mr. Bay will make another one and Smith, Lawrence and Union stick with it, but this time work on as case that takes them to New York to help out on a case that has to do with Terrorism. Now that would give you plenty of material for Action and the Drama and Comedy will follow.Great Job Guys.",Bad Boys II
432,matthewtrobson,"About what I expected, but much longer",4,15 March 2008,"Mild spoilers aheadI put this movie on once because there wasn't anything else to watch (plus, it got a recommendation in Hot Fuzz, which I loved). I didn't look at the running time, figuring ""It's only going to be an hour and a half, how bad could it be?"" Well, stuff blows up real good and cars smash into things. That's about the only thing this movie has going for it. Otherwise, the plot is clichéd, the characters irritating (it's not a good sign when you root for Klansmen to kill your protagonists), and the dialog makes you anxious to get back to the action. Even the action is annoying in that it is frequently filmed in the post-MTV shakycam with too many cuts.Final verdict? I heard this movie sucked, and I was not pleasantly surprised.",Bad Boys II
433,gtr316,Tapia,10,6 January 2005,"I have never seen a more convincing performance of a true nut case than Jordi Mollà's performance of Jonnny Tapia in this movie. I mean, kudos as usual to Lawrence, Smith, and of course Joe Pantoliano, but Molla is truly the real deal when it comes to playing a character you love to hate. Martin and Lawrence have proved once again that they are one of the top teams in the business, playing off of each other and placing themselves in the honorable ranks of Gibson/Glover and Tucker/Chan. Buddy movies come and go, but these guys should make more. Of this franchise and then some. My honest opinion is this movie is 10 times better than the first one, and I'd like to mention if you haven't seen it yet, you don't HAVE to see the first one to enjoy it. Much like the Lethal Weapon movies, you simply have to understand that they have been friends/partners for a long time and that is why their exchanges play out like a fine piece of music. Enjoy!",Bad Boys II
434,IncidentFlux,Non Stop FUN All The Way,10,28 January 2005,"As much I love to psycho analyze things to the nth level, its great to know that some movies are still plane IL' fun and extremely funny, if you liked the first one you'll really love this one.1. Sharp multiple camera angel shots. 2. Excellent Car chases. 3. Will Smith & Martin L. funny guys. 4. Excellent lighting giving the movie a BRIGHT feeling.If you're the kinda person who prefers to watch mostly reality, depressing, topical based flicks then Bad Boys 2 is not for you... CHOOSE LIFE!My simple movie ratings meter is love it or don't, and I loved Bad Boys 2, NO DOUBT! In the end movies are supposed to be fun aren't they?",Bad Boys II
435,lilcrystalyne,Bad Boys 2,10,28 February 2005,Bianca is a brilliant actress. This is the first time I have seen her in anything and I think she is going places. I think that her speaking part in this movie was really good considering this being her first film and all. I hope to see her in more movies.This movie was a real action. I loved it a lot.I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see new faces that have potential.I also recommend this movie to those that liked Bad Boys the first one.Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are seriously funny in this movie as well.Remember to look for Bianca Bethune who plays Megan Burnett.,Bad Boys II
436,superkev88,Amazing,10,17 April 2005,"By the far the best film i have ever seen. Its jam packed with action from start to finish, and its hands down the funniest film i've ever seen too. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are absolutely tremendous in this film. They make the film so good. The storyline is good, the special effects are breath taking. If you haven't already seen this film then you have to go out and see it right now, its absolutely amazing. It is the perfect film, full of action, comedy and great acting. You'll be rolling on the floor laughing at this and you'll be amazed by the action sequences. This is film is simply a masterpiece. Amazing stuff!!!!!",Bad Boys II
437,super_nic_ebob,Jerry Bruckheimer is an arsonist,1,5 March 2006,"""Look at the fire nymphs dancing in the flames!"" Is this one of the thoughts running through Mr Bruckheimer's head as yet another explosion occurs to tie up a loose end or hole in the plot? Seriously, this film isn't even a good bad film. The whole story moves at pace without purpose or direction and rarely makes any sense. Cats? As for the supposed comedy, I haven't seen a less funny film since Scary Movie 3, which I saw yesterday. Can Will and Martin really hope to take on and beat many issues such as racism, sexism and communism in this joke of a film? I think not. And what the shameless destruction of a shanty town (a lot of which explodes for no apparent reason) which is a poor imitation of Jackie Chan's Police Story? I hope I never have to see this again.Avoid this film like the plague, on fire.",Bad Boys II
438,mutapiri,bad boys 2,5,5 August 2005,"Plenty of gun firing, some witty lines but no ass kicking from the duo. If the bad boys can get some fighting skills from Matt Damon's director then this would be one hell of a movie to watch huh? The story is quite straight forward, and would benefit the sequel, if there ever would be one, if they employ real street wisdom without the use of guns. Seems like guns and blowing up stuff makes a big boom in the movie theatre. Thats just enough to make Michael Jackson squeal 'owwww...! Look, 'ain't that bad nigga!"" On the whole those guys still seemed as if age is catching up on them, and fast too! Look at Martin Lawrence in the video store, whining like an old man in need of Viagra, with Will Smith as the shrink who knows all about THAT manhood problem!!",Bad Boys II
439,amhennin0544,"Bad Boys, Bad Boys, Whatcha Gonna Do",10,15 September 2005,"Bad Boys 2 is one of the better movies i've ever seen. It has a little bit of everything you could want. Comedy and Action a plenty, along with some suspense and some partial nudity, granted it was dead nudity, but for some people that's all they get. The characters are portrayed to perfection, and Martin Lawrence and Will Smith have a superb on screen chemistry. There are some funny quotes throughout the movie, such as, ""I can't believe you two, do you call each other in the morning, 'Good morning Marcus, Good morning Mike, how you doin, Aiight."" Alright, in context it's a funny quote. Overall, this is pretty much the best movie i've ever seen, bare in mind that i'm a 19 year old who just likes to watch stuff blow up, and have a good laugh.",Bad Boys II
440,nvnsmc,To many trash scenes,1,13 August 2017,"Suitable for kids maybe, otherwise to many stupid trash scenes that should be funny, but in reality so stupid that is embarrassing to watch. Police driving Ferrari, on empty roads in city, haha, good joke. Don't know hoe can you watch this film without thinking how stupid it is.",Bad Boys II
441,tombcfc,make another one please!,10,25 January 2006,"Will Smith (Mike Lowrey) and Martin Lawrence (Marcus Burnett) are just great in Bad Boys 1 and 2. I prefer Bad Boys 2 more than the first one, so i think that they should definitely make a third movie.In the new movie they should bring in some more high profile actors and actresses to make it one of best movies to date. Imagine the ratings for another sequel. Michael Bay, Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer could make this movie be the greatest one yet. Maybe even make it an 18 again like the first movie.They've gotta make another one. Please, please, please, make another. Roll on Bad Boys 3 I say!",Bad Boys II
442,webmaster-2110,I've seen this movie more times than any other movie.,10,28 January 2006,"This is a very rare genre of movie that was pulled off with great success (in my opinion). Bad Boys 1 was equally as good, if not better for it's time, which I have also seen an unbelievable amount of times. Friends say that I am a huge Will & Martin fan, but I'm actually not, I am a huge fan of their characters in the movie along with Michael Bay's larger than life cinematography. With the combination of the Miami setting, the raw humor chemistry between Mike Lawrey and Marcus Burnett, the characters line up (from the KKK to the ruthless Rasta Zoe Pounders to Miami's finest), the Dr. Dre scores, and the action, action, action makes this movie, along with Bad Boys 1, the best I've seen. Being a Teamster in the motion picture industry in Hollywood and actually knowing real life people much like the Bad Boys II characters (with their ballin' lifestyles, foul language and spontaneous/hilarious comments), I can truly relate to this movie. For those of you who don't understand my review, basically Michael Bay has captured this genre to a tee... Great Job!",Bad Boys II
