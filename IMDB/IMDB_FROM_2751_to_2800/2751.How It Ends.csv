0,Leofwine_draca,Distinctly average,4,6 August 2018,"HOW IT ENDS is, unfortunately, another unwieldy Netflix film that doesn't work all that well. The story once again features the apocalypse (and some pretty nifty CGI effects, especially at the climax) and involves a couple of main characters attempting to escape from it with their lives. Sadly, HOW IT ENDS is generally mired in familiarity and tedium. The events that play out have been done countless times in the movies and they're done no differently here. The script is lowbrow, relying too heavily on profanity throughout with little wit or character insight; as such, genuinely good actors like Forest Whitaker are wasted in their roles. The end result is a mildly watchable but distinctly average kind of movie that you'll forget about soon after watching.",How It Ends
1,SnoopyStyle,world wrong,3,13 July 2018,"In Chicago, Will (Theo James) has a contentious dinner with his girlfriend Sam (Kat Graham)'s father Tom (Forest Whitaker). Afterwards, he's talking to Sam back home in Seattle when something cuts them off. A mysterious event has happened on the west coast. Power goes out across the nation and all flights are cancelled. Tom decides to drive to Seattle and Will joins him. They pick up native reserve mechanic Ricki (Grace Dove) along the way.The people fall into apocalyptic chaos rather quickly. It's a dark paranoid version of the world. I'm not oppose to it but it should build up to it. The world is civilized one minute and Mad Max the next. The movie could set up this world as a scary darker place from the start and maybe the transition wouldn't be as jarring. It should at least present civil unrests and pervasive personal attacks as normal every day events. It would be infinitely better than the terribly bland first act where the only good comes from a grumpy Whitaker.The premise of a national road block seems like easy story trickery. I don't know why drivers wouldn't simply use side streets. It's an artificial construction to create an abandoned world feel on the road. The inexplicable concepts keep piling up. The most illogical thing may be Ricki wanting to go west with a couple of sketchy guys. The only way to make sense of it is for her to be running away from a domestic conflict. So she wants to be a rapper. Big deal! None of it makes sense. At various points in the movie, I figured the only explanation to paper over all the holes is a supernatural one. This world is wrong and that's why the morality questions are meaningless. There is no answer and none would actually fits anyways. The final explanation is ill-fitting due to a lack of setup and remains unconvincing. Copying the Lost finale would make more sense.",How It Ends
2,nogodnomasters,Ever see anything like that?,3,29 August 2018,"Will (Theo James ) travels from Seattle to Chicago to request the blessing of Tom (Forest Whitaker) to marry his daughter Samantha (Kat Graham). While there something unexplained happens as all power and communication goes out. Will, opts to drive cross country with Forest Whitaker to check on Samantha. And it appears that no one in America has more than one day of food or gas as anarchy has broken out. We don't know what has happened and neither does anyone else. Nor do we get closure. Meteor? Deep state conspiracy? Nuclear bomb dropped off the coast of LA and an attack on the grid? Low budget ""2012."" Netflix has done better. Way too long. Should have shortened the trip and added a subplot to explain things. Guide: F-word. Implied sex. Brief nudity?",How It Ends
3,kosmasp,Beginning of the ending,6,19 December 2018,"If you take the title of the movie and what it delivers, I can see why quite a few reviewers are not happy with the end result. The movie is not really a classic, I think even the people who liked this more than me, can see that. It's still does the job overall. The title already suggests it, so we're not really surprised that something is going to happen.There's also some indicators that something is happening. What is it though? Will the movie give sufficient answers? And if not, will it matter to you? Or is it the journey that should count? Not sure if this was meant to have sequels, but as it is you can be rest assured that not everyone will have a good time watching this until the end",How It Ends
4,Sleepin_Dragon,A prelude for a second?,6,26 August 2018,"I can only think a second is in the pipeline, as that can be the only reason for such a rushed ending. Ambiguity in films is fine, I would praise the film for leaving certain parts to the viewers imagination, sometimes it's got that every strange occurrence in a film isn't black and white, ambiguity fine, lack of ending terrible.Previously to the bad ending, the film isn't at all bad, it's well acted, with some very well developed characters. You get to see human nature at its best, worst, plus you see what people will do when pushed to desperation.Some fantastic special effects, it looks and sounds brilliant, I can't fault that side of the film at all. The lazy ending kills the film for me though, did they run out of ideas or money, or is a second on the way.Decent, but lame ending. 6/10",How It Ends
5,CinemaSerf,..but does it....?,5,10 May 2020,"Now I do love a bit of Theo; any bit really - but yet again he finds himself turning up in a futuristic piece of banal sci-fi nonsense that is devoid of almost any original thought. In this effort, he is heading back to his pregnant girlfriend and as he travels the width of the country fleeing from an unknown - but cataclysmically destructive event - he encounters some decent, but mostly more scummy individuals who would steal the shoes from his feet should he stop still long enough. Forest Whitaker shares much of the journey with him, and to be fair, he does add a little weight to this rather flighty drama; but the rest of the cast/plot are the stuff of many, many earlier iterations of ""Day After Tomorrow"" type existential disaster movies. There are a few twists, mainly at the end - but I'm afraid this is just poor.",How It Ends
6,Wizard-8,"Reasonably compelling, though has some definite flaws",6,14 July 2018,"Movies that are exclusive to Netflix wildly range in quality... though then again, so do movies from almost any other source. This particular one is one of the better ones I have seen for some time, though I will admit that it does have some major flaws that hold it back from being better than it ultimately is. I could live with the fact that the reasons for the apocalypse in the movie - and its extent - are not fully spelled out. However, the screenplay does seem in a way to be making up things as it goes along, and that it doesn't have much of a plot - the movie is basically one vignette after another. Also I do agree with many of the other IMDb comments that the ending of the movie is quite unsatisfying and abrupt. Still, flaws and all, I was never bored by the movie. Though the movie is just a collection of vignettes, the vignettes for the most part do come across fairly realistically; you will feel that law and order has broken down in a believable manner. The production values are sound, and the performances are fine as well. I am certainly not saying that this is a GREAT movie, but I do think it's somewhat better than most people here are saying. It's best watched during a slow night.",How It Ends
7,sddavis63,This Is How It Ends? Seriously?,5,23 November 2018,"Seriously - this is how it ends? Seriously? This Netflix movie has the dumbest, most unfulfilling, most meaningless and even most infuriating ending I think I've ever come across in a movie. It's literally impossible to explain with any degree of satisfaction how it ends, because - well - it really doesn't end. It stops, but it doesn't end. Was the title supposed to be some sort of cute play on how it was actually going to end? Was there thought put into this? Was the non-existent end supposed to - in some way - be intelligent and thought-provoking? Or did absolutely everyone involved in putting this thing together just get collectively bored and say - ""OK. What the hell. We're done. Time for a snack."" It felt like the latter.What a letdown. I had actually been enjoying this movie. It was very effectively mysterious. You knew from the start that it was going to be. The opening caption was ""Chicago: 5:33 am."" Not 5:30 or 6:00, but specifically 5:33. I'm being a bit silly with that, but 5:33 tells you right off - something's happening. And something did happen. After a brief introduction relating a tense visit by Will to his in-laws in Chicago, we get right into it. Will is talking to his wife Sam in Seattle on the phone. And something happens there. There's a sound. She's obviously terrified. The line suddenly goes dead. It's quickly revealed that all contact with the west coast has been lost. Then power goes out - apparently everywhere. There's no communication, no satellites, no GPS. Nothing. The military appears. Panic builds, chaos ensues. And Will and his father in law Tom decide that they're going to have to drive to Seattle to find Sam. And in an increasingly panic-stricken and lawless nation that journey is going to be a challenge.I was really enjoying the story. And then something happened. I'm not sure what it was but I pin it pretty much to the point when Tom dies. Tom was played by Forest Whitaker. I've always liked Whitaker, although never really thought of him as someone who could carry a movie. But it all fell apart when his character died. I honestly didn't feel that any of the rest of the cast had truly stood out, but this had been mysterious and interesting and even at times exciting, but with the death of Tom it descended to just plain silly. And it kept getting worse. Right up to that ending that wasn't an ending. That ending that explained absolutely nothing. That ending that wasn't intelligent or thought-provoking but that honestly just seemed truly lazy on the part of everyone involved with this.Seriously - this is how it ends? I'm going to give this a 5/10, only because I had been enjoying this. But the last half hour or so gets about a minus 40.",How It Ends
8,Hellmant,"Seems really uneventful to me, and kind of pointless.",6,27 July 2018,"'HOW IT ENDS': Three Stars (Out of Five)An action-thriller about a man trying to reach his pregnant fiance, with her father, after an apocalyptic disaster hits. It was directed by David M. Rosenthal, and it was written by Brooks McLaren. The film stars Theo James, Forrest Whitaker, Grace Dove and Kat Graham. It's received mostly negative reviews from critics, and it was released by Netflix through it's streaming site. I enjoyed parts of it, like the casting. Will Younger (James) has had a very difficult relationship with his soon-to-be father-in-law, Tom (Whitaker). Tom appears to hate Will, and he's not happy that his daughter, Samantha (Graham), is going to marry him, and have a child with him. So when an unexplained apocalyptic disaster hits, Will is not happy that Tom wants to take a road trip with him, to make sure Samantha is OK. Still, the two set out on a very uncomfortable end of the world adventure together. The movie surprisingly seems really uneventful to me, and kind of pointless. James is good in the lead though, and I wish he'd do more movies. Whitaker is also of course fantastic in it, like always. I do like the father-in-law and son relationship developed between the two characters, in the movie, but that's about all it has going for it. Besides a few cool disaster flick action scenes that is.",How It Ends
9,Platypuschow,How It Ends: Haha very funny guys where's the rest of it?,6,10 December 2018,"I was hesitant going into How It Ends because I can't stand Theo James, there is something deeply obnoxious about him that immediatly puts me off a film.However truth be told he wasn't the problem here, in fact his performance was far better than I expected it to be. Standing side by side with veteran Forest Whitaker this thriller wasn't what I expected at all.It tells the story of a man who races across the country with his other halfs father during a seemingly apocalyptic event to save her life.It's a visual treat, stunning to look at which you certainly don't expect with a movie of this type. It truly is beautiful despite the grim setting so they've accomplished something truly remarkable here.Though a bit repetitious and laggy as the story progresses it's the finale that really hobbles the film. Namely, it doesn't really have one and that's such an incredible shame as the movie was going so well up until that point. Some may disgaree with me on that, I personally didn't appreciate it.Regardless it's a good effort and very easy on the eyes.The Good:A visual treatThe Bad:Finale, or lack thereofThey seem to run out of ideasThings I Learnt From This Movie:Everyone is bad when the poop hits the fanTheo James isn't entirely useless",How It Ends
10,ops-52535,its preppin' time,7,15 July 2018,"I think this is a good movie,that tells more than just an apocalyptic story,even though ,at times, i feel a touch of loopholes and missing links. i do have a better understanding of why some people are hoarding and prepping their basements or storm shelters or forts full of food batteries and gasoline.i will not award this film more than 7,but it is a refreshing try among the svarm of c and d movies of this genre.if you are looking for a ''happy ending'' this is not your favourite,allas what would you do when apocalypse now...........",How It Ends
11,cruise01,Lazy writing with lack of plots logic but could have been worse.,6,29 July 2018,"How It Ends (3 out of 5 stars).How It Ends is a decent action disaster film which lays a little mystery on what the seismic disaster event is and a plot about a guy trying to drive across several states to get to his girlfriend. These Netflix original films have been missing on hitting their marks on being good. This one was not any better but is acceptable for a decent movie.The plot could have been written a little better. Will (Theo James) and girlfriend Sam (Kat Graham) are expecting their first baby together. They live in Seattle. Will flies to Chicago alone to visit Sam's parents and to ask for her fathers Tom (Forest Whitaker) permission to marry her. (Why does he fly alone to visit his girlfriends parents while she stays behind? Sure beats me, the film never answers.) While Will and Tom do not see eye to eye and their dinner conversation ends in an argument. As Will is about to get the flight back to Seattle. An earthquake shakes up the west coast of the country. With power going out, the heat wave increasing, the ground rumbling on the west coast. With flights cancelled. Tom and Will are going to drive across country to go get Sam. They will come across a strange green colored cloud with a weird rain pattern. They will come across shady people that will steal their supplies. Along with escaped convicts. And trying to avoid military roadblocks.That was all there was to the plot. Sure, there are some issues and logic such as why does Will travel alone to visit Sam's parents? Maybe, the writer's logic was to set up the story of having Will travel across states to save Sam from this disaster. The film's script could have been written better on telling a better plot than that. Plus it becomes a buddy road trip as they travel across a heat wave landscape with Will and Tom. Besides, they despise each other. They soon learn their differences and become better friends. I like how the disaster event is kept hidden. With only a few details revealed or hinted towards. Like it started down in Los Angeles, than a heat wave is at high alert, and possibly a tsunami has hit the northern west coast. And one's character theory was that it is a military experimental drill with setting a nuclear bomb in the sea to cause this outrage. The film wastes no time with setting up chaos with the disaster. The audience will not see much besides a town on fire or the aftermath of a destroyed city. With the characters seeing the chaos and the nasty side of people when they are stealing for supplies or will kill just to survive. Sadly, the film has no character development with Theo James or Forest Whitaker. They are decent with their characters. But the script had flat characters. Kat Graham was okay too but she was only in it for a small amount of screen time. The film does get a bit boring when nothing is going on in the second act of the movie. When Will and Tom are traveling. Sure, you will get beautiful cinematography work camera shots of the landscape. But nothing to keep you interested or any story progression. Overall, How It Ends is a fair film. The concept was entertaining to see how this chaos of a disaster will play out. The plot was terrible. The acting was decent. The script delivered boring characters and barely anything going on for most of the movie. And the ending ended too quickly. Almost similar to Liam Neeson's The Grey movie. But at least that movie was way better and it worked for that. How It Ends just ends abruptly during the climax.",How It Ends
12,Tweetienator,Who Cares?,4,15 October 2021,"How It Ends got nothing really remarkable but the ending which seems to upset a lot of people. To be honest I do not care about the ending because everything I got served is - average, well known, nothing unique or original, mediocrity mediocre produced. A Netflix production like so many - made to fill up the backing catalog. Verdict: somewhat okay, but would I recommend How It Ends to you? The answer is simple: no.",How It Ends
13,iquine,An Open Ended Disaster Movie,8,21 November 2018,"(Flash Review)Some unknown disaster has hit the West Coast and has a ripple effect far into the US. A daughter's father and her boyfriend, at emotional odds, drive from Chicago to locate her as she was talking to her boyfriend on the phone when this event strikes. Her father, a former Marine, and boyfriend lawyer attempt to handle peculiar events, recklessly and dangerously scared people and crazy weather phenomenon as they make their voyage while mending their relationship and building respect for each other. This film was captivating as the viewer is constantly trying to pick up clues, along with the characters, as to what is happening. It intentionally leaves some story lines open ended while also reflecting on how both good and bad actions come out of people during extreme chaos. There was a nice accompanying soundtrack that was very atmospheric, solid acting and really good cinematography.",How It Ends

16,robertemerald,Wonderful end of world survival tale,8,25 April 2020,"There are a lot of indie movies about an apocalyptic event that isn't quite explained. How It Ends has learnt the lesson and tries to prevail. With big budget effects it gives us big clues, yet never loses its mystery as to what is really going on, and thus a genuine line of tension throughout. Great story, actors and script, with the writers painting a highly believable picture of America coming to terms with sudden change and catastrophe. The world doesn't instantly go all Mad Max. But the picture painted, day by day, is nether-the-less one of increasing extremes. It's an easy watch, and any sci-fi fan should love it. I docked it a couple of points for the total blackout of government advice. I thought that, at least, did need some explaining. If you disagree with me then this would really be a 10 out of 10 effort. And there is room for a sequel, which is great for fans of this one, or a nice touch if such isn't intended.",How It Ends

Incredibly stupid movie that barely kept my attention. What's the main problem you ask? I'm sick of apocalyptic films where we learn absolutely nothing about what's causing the disaster. Society falls apart in about four minutes, the government as usual is impotent. Yes these two men drive from the east coast to the west coast (one dying along the way) and barely break a sweat? One silly cliche after another and then - no pay off at all. Waste of time.",How It Ends
18,omendata,Great Apocalypse Movie For Those With A Brain,7,14 July 2018,"Suprisingly good film from start to finish.Cannot believe all the reviews complaining about the ending - it just points out the lack of intelligence/intellect of our dumbed down social media generation and how everyone seems to need to be spoon-fed the answers to everything these days - its quite sad actually. It is the end of the world, so how did you think it would end; did even the title of the movie not give you a clue perhaps?The scene with the compass and the magnetic aurora basically gave the game away - magnetic poles changing which scientists have already said has happened to the earth many times before - many hundreds of times if I remember the article in Science magazine a decade or so ago - the last one occurring during the stone age. The scenes with the birds losing their sense of direction also alluded to the reason but obviously the majority of sheeple who watch movies now have sub par intelligence and are part of the reality tv generation who haven't read a book or are interested in science and nature!The end was entirely fitting to the movie and if you have to give a movie a low 1 or 2 out of 10 even though the acting was great, had great special effects and a decent story just because you want everything laid out on a plate for you then you should not be reviewing movies on IMDB! You are just as bad as the shills being paid to give every movie a 10 out of 10.If you like your apocalypse end of the world type movies you will enjoy this even more and if you are just looking for a decent movie to pass a night this will do very nicely indeed!",How It Ends

But as the film goes on the clues get more scarce and the explanation seems to drift away.The characters are realistic and engaging but their journey is too long and protracted.
The viewer has no idea why people are fighting over petrol or what they are running from and none of the characters think to ask.Now as for using your imagination to fill in the ending (which is a real running kick in the sacks).
I think it is ok for a film to hide Why something is happening (like Cloverfield or Survivor) but not to obscure WHAT is happening.Without this basic knowledge it feels like people are just driving around the countryside shooting each other for no reason.",How It Ends
23,ASouthernHorrorFan,"My Review Of ""How It Ends""",5,19 July 2018,"The story that Brooks McLaren offers is a doomsday situation, fueled by family drama and total upheaval of social norms, that is full of bluster and low on substance. The characters are developed and relatable, only the archetypes are structured on somewhat obsolete ideals. Luckily the performances are put together by some seasoned talent who manage to give life to this group of ""survivors"". Basically ""How It Ends"" plays out as a mismatched buddy roadtrip, but a dark, intense cross country trip through Armageddon.Special effects, both CGI and practical, are worthy and well done examples of quality. The scene after scene moments of - ""just how screwed life just got"" - are blockbuster level and really give ""How It Ends"" one of its few good elements. The backgrounds and scenic aspects are cenamatic tablous. I even found no flaws with the music score.The downfall for this one is the simple fact of writer and director choice. The lack of information that sets the scene for what and why we are in the apocalypse is absent. The relationships of these characters seem like intentional cliches with no real grasp on motivation or emotional investment in one another on a level that shows true understanding of objective. It kinda looks as if you get like storyboard in motion but not the substance that puts them all together. And the non-ending thing is annoying. Overall ""How It Ends"" is a mediocre movie that has as much wrong as it gets right.",How It Ends
24,rps-2,"Loved it, hated it...",6,25 July 2018,"This is a very well done nail biter. The cinematography and scenery are great, the acting is excellent, the effects are impressive.But they have smeared an otherwise excellent film with excessive use of the ""f-word"" Over and over as a noun, an adjective, a verb, a modifier, an exclamation. Here and there? Okay!. In almost every line of dialogue? Objectionable! And although youngsters might enjoy it, they should not be exposed to this torrent of profanity. I doubt if there is as much foul language on a warship as there is in this film.
Although it's an apocalypse story, it assumes that in the face of cataclysm, everybody turns into a self centered, villainous bad guy. If something like this did indeed happen, there would be lots of good guys too. 
It's also puzzling why two of the main characters vanish in mid plot for no discernable dramatic reason.
As for the ending (or lack of it), it failed to produce the dramatic impact that I'm sure was intended.
I would have given it an 8 were it not for the pointless bad language.",How It Ends

At one time the current North Pole was the South Pole, imagine what that would look like if you were on the Planet Earth's Surface as that happened. The Polar Axis Shift can be measured by looking at the Magnetic Deviation from True North on old Maps, comparing that information to new Maps Magnetic Deviation.Earth's Orbit around the Sun, the Earth's Orbit around the Sun has been changing, from circular to oval, causing temperature changes, and dramatic fluctuations of gravity.Earth's rotational speed, any changes means all kinds of catastrophic disturbances.Magnetosphere, the Earth's Surface is rotating in one direction the Earth's nickel iron core is rotating in the other direction, this creates a huge electro magnetic field in Space that protects the Earth, especially from the effects of the Sun like the Sun's Solar Flares that missed the Earth, a Solar Flare that is too close will not be protected by anything even the Magnetosphere.Earth's Rotation, the Earth does NOT rotate perfectly on Axis.

Basically a love story, road trip, buddy movie, end of the world all thrown in the mix with the added twist that you don't know what is happening or why, which personally I enjoyed. A lot of films these days feel they must answer every question, but as with A Quiet Place sometimes the best films don't even try. This film had so much going for it but it was just too long and in places just got boring. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed it but not as much as I thought I would. By far the underlying message from this film for me is what us humans can do to each other in a time of crisis and who decides who need's water, fuel, food ETC the size of a gun? Does the person rescuing their daughter have more right to supplies over someone protecting their family? Interesting story, wonderful acting, disappointing ending but just too long.

27,witster18,The irony is.... it doesn't.,4,16 July 2018,"""How it Ends"" is a decent apocalyptic road trip down memory lane. Harps of ""the Road"" meets ""Monsters"", or ""Skyline"". The film has many positive characteristics. Whitaker is great as usual. Other characters have some development. The film is pretty entertaining and thrilling at times, but there's also a lot that is wrong with the film.The first major problem is that the characters make many unrealistic and unnecessary, risky decisions. Another issue comes when the film drops one of its more interesting characters, like dead weight. The only characteristic worse than that is when the film drops the ending much the same way. Warning major spoiler(not really)! Do NOT watch this film! There is absolutely nothing worse than when a film, a decent film, just stops; literally like one day the director woke up half way through filming, all funding was dropped, and the cameras were packed away.How disappointing. Of all the incomplete films, abrupt endings, and disappointments in general.. this is one of the worst. I literally discount double checked the title page to make sure it wasn't a series. Nope. Think about the last time you felt completely unsatisfied - that is how you will feel when the credits roll. I mean take a shot. Even if it's bad, rushed, or just ridiculous...

29,kuarinofu,A mess / spoilers (yet there is nothing to spoil),4,5 August 2018,"This starts like a The Road type of movie, but without actual characters and character development. I mean, there are two ""sort-of-characters"" - the harsh father and the whiny groom lacking of self-confidence. They are not well written so you can't really relate to them. 
The father is a VETERAN MARINE who doesn't know how to patch up a car radiator (seriously?). He is so vague you can't really tell what he is supposed to be and how is he supposed to react. Whitaker is giving his ok performance which is totally fine by this movie standards.
The groom, in turn, feels weak and whiny throughout the whole movie up to like the last 15 minutes. He makes one stupid mistake after another, behaving like a little kid all the time. Surprisingly enough, in the last 15 minutes he turns male alpha becoming Jason Bourne. IMHO, Theo James can't act so he is unable to deliver any emotional moment throughout the movie. But this drastic change in his character is caused more by the horrendous writing.
There is also a native American girl, who is in the movie for like 40 minutes to provide for vague environmental and anti-war commentary yet she is scrapped so fast she's easy to forget. She adds two more stupid decisions to the list: 1) She joins two shady guys on a risky roadtrip to earn 2000$; 2) She leaves in the middle of nowhere without actually getting paid (after endangering the trip with another stupid decision).
The groom's girl is also in the movie, but she is more like a device, not a real human being, just a quest, an objective.
This plays somewhat ok for around 1 hour when you realize that nothing is really going on. They move through the US occasionally getting some cliche and unoriginal encounters, making stupid decisions and running away from someone. We and the ""characters' are trying to guess what has actually happened yet there are not enough info to make a judgement here.
But then, the ending rushes in, adding a last minute out of nowhere neighbor subplot to show that the groom has become Jason Bourne. Then, the movie just decides to stop, without providing any clever hints or anything regarding WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED. Done, Fin.
This feels like a couple of stories mixed up together, lots of re-writes and no clear vision or direction. Maybe Netflix did this thing again when they buy unfinished scripts and try to squeeze something out of it, like they did with The Cloverfield Paradox.
I did, however, enjoy the visual part, nature shots were great and they have managed to buff up the production value, which is great for such a low budget.
The atmosphere is there, you can feel it, but when you sort of tune yourself into this movie you step into a void, because there is nothing there to back up all the great visuals. There is no story and characters to care about.",How It Ends

31,acedj,Ambiguous ending but still good,8,6 May 2021,"Will and Samantha, a mixed race couple find out that they are pregnant. They live in Seattle and Will heads back East to visit with Sam's parents with the idea of asking for her hand in marriage. There is a lot of tension between Will and Tom, Sam's dad. At first it seems like it may be because of the fact that Will is white, but it turns out that Will did something egregious to Tom's boat years ago.The day after his visit and while on the phone with Sam, some event happens and they are disconnected. The event causes the entire country to suffer a black out and rumors swirl as to what had happened on the west coast. Will and Tom decide to drive to Seattle to rescue Samantha. On the way there they battle the effects of the event and people that are hell bent on taking their car and gas.This movie is almost non-stop action and Forrest Whitaker shines in his roll. My only complaint is the ending. It is, as my title suggests ambiguous. It causes the viewer to have to imagine what happens, and that may not really be a bad thing. This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout most of it and despite the low ratings given by many, I feel it is worth a watch.",How It Ends
32,stevenrotherforth,"First rule of storytelling. It needs a beginning, a middle and an ending!",3,27 September 2018,"How it endsIf the title of this movie was a question on how this Netflix Original finishes then I could give you quite a few words to sum this film up.
Disappointing, vague, inconclusive, poor!
These are but a few that immediately spring to mind.
With a runtime of 1hr 53mins this is time that you'll never get back. 
It's time that as it passes you are aware that this movie is indeed on a road to nowhere. Nevertheless it is hard to jump ship and abandon this movie due to some engaging performances from the cast.
Both Theo James and Forrest Whitaker do a good job at keeping the audience intrigued only for there to be no pay off by the time credits roll.
The story tells of a desperate man trying to get home to his pregnant fiancée in the midst of a apocalyptic event.
We the audience are as bamboozled as the characters on screen as it is never made apparent what has actually happened.
This at first helps raise the intrigue but all stories need a beginning,middle and an ending. This film does have a beginning but then just becomes a series of events that lead to no satisfying conclusion. Any type of conclusion would be welcome!
It's a real head scratcher of a movie, one that has no real lasting impression because it doesn't have a functional story.CGI is decent and this film does have a look of despair weaved into its cinematography.
It sounds pretty good too but none of this can save it from being a forgettable and irritating experience.",How It Ends

Then, the thing just stopped, as most of us noted, but according to people with better brains, we were too stupid to understand it is actually the ending and is cool, brilliant, satisfying. The fact that it does just stop and on a pretty bizarre note, does not faze the critics of critics because they were more interested in calling other people stupid. So. That's the ending of the movie: no denouement, but outracing some mountain dust. Some think it's a natural or unnatural event we've been warned about, which makes sense and fits some hints. But none of that is really explored within the film; in fact, characters are still asking what happened at the end. And then other critics of critics say we'll find out in ""the sequel."" Got it. Of what? At any rate, I don't mind logical open-ended films, and I enjoy a good debate. Some folks didn't criticize but tried to help explain and made some sense. But others chose the boorish behavior of stereotyping and attacking people they don't even know-a shadow of the kind of behavior the film suggests will happen after the apocalypse.

35,eberkerbatur,"Simple, worse than any other apocalypse movies don't waste your time (2.7)",3,2 April 2020,"The movie started slowly like an apocalypse movie at first briefly described the events. Later an unexplained sound, earthquakes, power outages and everything developed so fast until the airplanes stopped the world drifted into chaos in almost one day, I wasn't expecting it to develop so fast in one day.Like other disaster movies, we watched classic images such as shop looting and military units coming to the cities.
and then turned into a car adventure of a father and his future son who wanted to save his daughter. Everything went predictably, they were attacked many times on the road, often because of gasoline. They decided to pick up a stranger in the car where they stopped first, then it is unknown where this stranger disappeared.As the movie progressed it got more ridiculous and began to get boring, eventually found the girl and the final scenes were more in explanation rather than action, like scenarios about how the Apocalypse happened, all of them happen on the 5th day.
with the most absurd and mixed final scene, I have ever seen the movie ended(I found the last scene successful in terms of visual effects).I did not like the film in general, it was like an absurd and predictable classic world extinction film.

36,gustheaffen,Original Netflix content is now formulaic and boring,2,20 July 2018,"Netflix used to be the go to for great original content. They've completely squandered their brand trying to flood their subscribers with original content that now is politically correct, loaded with SJW BS, and is just plain mundane and boring. This movie is almost 2 hours! Why, they certainly didn't have much of a story to tell. They loaded the characters with a white guy, a black guy and an American Indian woman and like every new 'ORIGINAL' content product they've come up with in the last few years, they've made sure to load it with random comments about the injustice of how American Indians have been treated, the military being horrible hypocrites to name their planes honoring American Indians, and of course they added in a slew of redneck white guys trying to rob and murder everyone they come across (all they were missing was their MAGA hats). They just needed one of these male characters in drag and we would have had a home run. 
The story itself was nothing remotely original. Some unknown disaster befalls the west coast. The baby daddy finally deciding he will marry his GF conveniently shows up in Chicago to ask her militant father for permission. Disaster strikes and unlikely foes father and BF decide to drive to Seattle to find her. Stupid stuff happens along the way, nothing very interesting. He finally gets to their apartment that looks like it is in a radiation zone and she had conveniently left her location. He finds her and she is with a neighbor who spews a bunch of conspiracy theories as to what happened and then tries to kill the main character.

37,ginocox-206-336968,"Like a two-year-old: destructive, but unable to communicate",1,16 July 2018,"How it Ends (2018) is less about an apocalyptic disaster, than about how people might respond to such an event. Unfortunately, the filmmakers have nothing much to say that is particularly original, insightful or interesting. As the filmmakers seem only interested in telling a human story, they pay little attention to the scientific or technical aspects. Consequently, the film seems hopelessly contrived. A very intelligent and well-researched review by David Bressan published in Forbes details how many of the perils described in the film could be caused by the eruption of a supervolcano, although the effects would be observed over months or years, not the course of a week. But the filmmakers offer little in the way of scientific explanation beyond idle speculation by various characters, instead presenting various scenes of disaster with little coherence. Not only is scientific ignored, but also logistics and logic. Will (Theo James) and Tom (Forest Whitaker) encounter a roadblock on I-90, possibly at the Wisconsin - Minnesota border. A soldier explains that the road is closed west of there, due to lack of communications. Of course, communications are also down east of there, as well, so what difference it makes is unclear. They finagle their way past and thereafter, the roads are virtually abandoned, although they encounter no other roadblocks or even state troopers. Where's the eastbound traffic? Where are the vehicles that enter I-90 from the hundreds of entrance ramps along the route? As the setting and situation seem unrealistic, it is difficult to regard the emotions and interactions as realistic. Will walks a couple of hundred yards to get two five-gallon cans of gasoline, then leaves them behind. At several points, his life depends on using firearms, but he leaves enough weapons behind to arm a platoon. Although Will has never fired a weapon, he can shoot as well as one of Clint Eastwood's characters by the end of the film. Two characters, driving 90+ mph along an unfamiliar road to escape an imminent peril, engage in long loving glances and a lingering kiss. A retired soldier, who has been in civilian life for quite a while, happens to carry a device used by combat medics. Will happens to have friends at strategic points along the route and happens to know how to drive to their homes. Will finds the corpses of families who seem to have died simultaneously and instantaneously, without frantically trying to save one another. The movie suffers from liberal conceit. Some in Hollywood advocate for more roles for blacks and women. So, Will has an interracial romance with Samantha (Kat Graham). The conceit lies in assuming the audience will be automatically sympathetic, without making her character special or even interesting. She's attractive but not so stunningly beautiful as to immediately convince the audience of Will's fascination and undying love. She comes off as slightly shrewish in the early scenes, drinks to excess and a character unreliably implies she was unfaithful. She doesn't have any major faults, but doesn't have obvious special qualities, either. Nothing tells the audience that this is the perfect girl for Will. Her father seems to hold Will in low esteem for everything except for being Caucasian. The movie also makes vague allusions to various social issues, including child abuse, treatment of Native Americans, pollution, firearms, our dependence on fossil fuels and government ineffectuality. Cities are depicted as crowded and oppressive, while the countryside is lovingly photographed as verdant and unspoilt. Several characters, who reject urban civilization in favor of country living, seem likely to survive; while those who left the countryside for the city, on business or whatever, seem likely to have perished. But the film never makes a coherent statement. The human motivations seem contrived. Much of the population seem to have fled their homes without even locking their doors behind them; yet marauders seem to prefer to attack those who can fight back. The marauders seem only interested in stealing gasoline, although they shoot a few people and slash s few tires. Despite the complete breakdown of law and order, none seem interested in committing any crimes that liberals find particularly egregious, such as sexual harassment, rape, human trafficking, blaming migrants for the disaster, using the N-word or lynching minorities. Even in the face of a complete breakdown of law and order, everybody continues to embrace progressive liberal values. Production values are adequate, as are performances. Both deserve a more coherent script. As the film often employs extreme jiggly-cam shots to simulate temblors, it wisely avoids using jiggly-cam for other shots.",How It Ends
38,Thrashman88,How It Cheats!,5,24 July 2018,"""How It Ends"" is a highly entertaining flick about an apparent worldwide apocalypse. The movie is quick and lean and grabs the viewer from the very start, that is until it ""ends"". The ending truly throws out the window all the drama and suspense the audience spent up until that point in the movie. Imagine Star Wars, A New Hope: the rebels are prime and ready to take on the Death Star. We see their battle ships approaching the Death Star and begin firing at it. Then, all of the sudden, the ending credit roll on! What?!?!? Did the rebels win? Did they lose? Do they become friends with the Empire? Well, that's exactly how ""How It Ends"" ends: a complete disregard for the audience. It's as if the writer died before submitting the last page of his screenplay but the producers decided to go ahead and shoot the film anyway. And it's sad because the movie was, up until that point, very interesting, well acted and produced.

Most of this was done very nicely, at human scale. What do you know? Not that much. Maybe you just missed it, as when everyone in Shaun of the Dead is ignoring the newspaper headlines, etc.Two things didn't work:
1) The timeline. I get people falling into chaos, but...instantly? Where did everyone go? Why would you set off on a road trip on hour one of a disaster? No reason it had to be this quick, either. Have more tension as he hangs out in their apartment a week, while nothing improves (make Chicago have rolling blackouts instead of all blackout), and info is sparse, and then they both decide to go on a trip to save her, take some time to plan it even. Continue the tension there before the road trip starts lightening it.

46,ivko,decent disaster movie with a lot of unresolved plot points,6,28 July 2018,"This review will contain, well not spoilers exactly because it will just be my guesses about plot points based upon events in the film, but maybe something spoiler adjacent. So if you are really spoiler sensitive you may not want to read further.First, the non-spoiler stuff. The main protagonist of the movie is a Seattle lawyer named Will Younger who is dating and having a baby with a woman named Samantha Sutherland. Will and Samantha want to get married, but Samantha's father Tom, a well-off former marine, doesn't approve of the relationship. Still, getting his blessing is important to Samantha so Will flies to the east coast to have dinner with her parents and ask.The dinner doesn't go well, and Will is asked to leave early. He wakes the next morning to Samantha calling and angrily demanding an explanation for his behavior. During the call a strange noise is heard on her end and the call cuts out after she indicates that ""something"" is happening and that she is afraid.Will makes his way to the airport only to find that all flights are cancelled because of what the news is reporting as a possible earthquake on the west coast that has cut off all communications. He also discovers, without explanation, that the power is also out on the east coast and observes military aircraft flying over the city.After making his way back to Samantha's parents, Will and Tom set out by car to try and drive to the west coast to rescue Samantha. It quickly becomes apparent that society is breaking down, with muggers attempting to steal from people at crowded gas stations and the military blockading portions of the country for ""safety"" reasons.What follows is a dangerous road trip as Will and Tom try to avoid getting robbed or worse and gradually bond in the face of shared adversity. Along the way various hints are dropped as to the nature of the events, although the movie is careful to avoid ever giving any direct explanations.The tone of the movie is almost continuously tense, whether it's interpersonal tension like that between Will and Tom and to an extent Will and Samantha, or the tension of direct conflict, or just the tension of the unknown. Character development is relatively low; Will is a kind of 'every man' that is meant to be the stand-in for the audience and gets the most dimension, but most of the other characters are just archetypes, like the stern and disapproving Tom who complains about younger generations not wanting to work hard.Still, for the most part the story being told doesn't really require a lot of depth. This is a what-if story about surviving the collapse of civilization; a reminder of just how helpless we would be if the ubiquitous electronics and conveniences of the modern world were suddenly turned off. No credit cards, no cell phones, no GPS, no fully stocked 24/7 gas stations; it really is pretty unnerving to think of how you would get by if all those things suddenly went away without warning.I mean, I can't even remember the last time I paid for something with cash instead of a check card, and just about anything more than fifteen minutes from my house and I need my cell phone to guide me. So this aspect of the movie resonated for me. But apart from that the movie is re-treading a lot of familiar territory, and the complete refusal to provide explanations for a lot of the events makes the movie feel like the first episode of a new show, with cliff-hangers thrown in to encourage you to ""tune in next week"".So here's the part that's kind of spoiler-ish. The movie doesn't provide an explanation for the strange events, but I think it depicts a street level view of a coup. One of the characters describes how he had seen computer simulations of events similar to the ones that unfold in the movie, and describes the objective of those simulations as being the destruction of ""rational behavior"".It's kind of the only explanation that works, imo. As characters in the movie point out, if it was only a natural disaster like a massive earthquake, the power in the rest of the country wouldn't be effected, nor would the military be called in to blockade sections of the country, and of course it wouldn't affect the communication satellites that provide television, phone, and GPS. Not even an attack, terrorist or nation-state, would be likely to cause such a total communications blackout.The explanation that fits best is that some disaster, man made or natural, of sufficient scale was used as pretext to explain conditions such as power and communication outages. So long as people didn't know that a coup was taking place, the would-be dictators could use the confusion and chaos to make changes that prevented an organized resistance like divide and conquer blockades. Put people in the dark, literally and figuratively, and they could use the period of chaos to quietly seize certain strategic resources and positions, so that by the time people got suspicious it would be too late to create an organized resistance.Of course that's a total guess, but I think it makes sense. Anyway, if you don't mind the lack of an explanation for what's causing the events in the movie, it's a decent disaster action thriller now available on Netflix.",How It Ends
47,datorsiers2,Nobody knows what is happening,2,21 July 2018,"In this movie nobody knows what is happening, including the writers, since we never get shown reasons behind anything. The movie has a fair bit of action throughout, although it is quite boring and blatant at times, only one perspective is shown in this film, without any background information of anything else going on besides Will and Tom going on their pathetic rescue mission.  This movie has absolutely no plot if you think about it, there is a premise, there is a goal, but everything that happens is just plain dumb. Why is the weather changing? Why do we have all these insane deadly storms? Why is everybody out to get each other all of a sudden? There are no answers, it seems as if they just want to film useless action without needing to elaborate on what is actually going on. Also, this movie has one of the worst endings i have ever seen in any movie, peridod. That is if you can even call an ending, maybe it is an intended pun, since the name of the movie matches the actual ending accurately, How it ends? Nobody knows, even the writers did not know, they probably just got bored of filming useless action with no meaning and decided to go to a pub, since there will surely be people to watch it anyways, so why do we need an ending, right? Overall, the movie is not great, would not recommend watching this since the plot is non-existant and at times really non-sensical too, paired with cringy cliche dialogues of a natural disaster action movie making it into a real mess.

In a fit of jealousy he attempts to kill our main character only for him to turn into Wyatt Earp and shoot him first then drive away with the woman. In the background an explosion of some sort, similar to a volcanic eruption, produces a cloud which chases them as they drive before it runs out of steam and the drive away to live, I guess, in a post-apocalyptic world.Who knows.

51,TheRadiobox,50% off script sale,5,30 July 2021,"How It Ends was directed by David M. Rosenthal, written by Brooks McLaren, and stars Theo James, Forest Whitaker, Grace Dove, Nicole Ari Parker, and Kat Graham. It follows a small group of survivors as they traverse an ending world in the hope of finding one man's pregnant wife before the world gets worse.The Plot: There's some merit to the thread that How It Ends presents, having a cross-country adventure to find a loved one before a catastrophe is intrinsically captivating because that journey is something many people would take despite the risks. While it's an easy plot to follow, the movie struggles with it, providing diversion after diversion instead of focusing on the clear potential of its characters' venture, indulging in cliche more often than not. Will (James) isn't having the best time dealing with people. After flying to Chicago to meet with his pregnant girlfriend Samantha's (Graham) parents, Paula (Parker) and Tom (Whitaker), Will doesn't get the outcome he wanted; storming out of their presence with the intention to return to his girlfriend in Seattle. During a call with Samantha, whom the movie wisely steers clear of for the time being, the power on the west coast goes out and chaos ensues. Going back to Will, the same chaos has erupted in Chicago. Now hoping to get back as fast as he can, he enlists the help of the reluctant Tom to get to Samantha before something really bad happens, running into various obstacles and people, including a temporary passenger in Ricki (Dove) who disrupt the journey and the movie with tonal shifts, average action beats, and middlingly presented moral dilemmas until the story comes to a screeching ""conclusion"" in which How It Ends refuses to elaborate on, well, how it ends.The Characters: McLaren's script offers character introductions just as effectively as it introduces the plot, which is to say that there's a great setup for conflict and dramatic exchanges but that's where the praise ends. Will is in a decent state as he's making good money as a lawyer, looking at buying a house for his burgeoning family, and has plans to expand once he's ready. However, he's inexperienced at plenty of basics like firing a gun and holding his temper, both of which make him feel real enough to identify with. Tom is the protective father figure made more so because of his military background who wants nothing but the best for his daughter, which essentially eliminates Will's chances of obtaining his blessing for marriage, causing tension between the two. It's an understandable conflict that occasionally gets explored between bouts of tone-deaf dialogue from Ricki, who makes a believable first impression, especially given the state in which the two arrive, but quickly becomes a headache due to consistently idiotic and convoluted decision making and relentless heckling of the people who are helping her get where she wants to go. Samantha makes for an easily sympathetic goal too but doesn't register as more than that. The core dynamic between Will and Tom is solid but gets tossed by the wayside in favor of action that doesn't pulse, and when Whitaker isn't present James loses an acting mate which cuts the character in half.The Adventure: Rosenthal makes an interesting decision in his near ignorance of the apocalyptic event which starts (and ends... kind of) the journey. Occasional symptoms of the disaster are revealed as time goes on and the characters get closer to Washington but there's never a finger pointed directly at the cause, which helps to raise intrigue as to just what obstacles the characters will have to overcome next an engaging question that alleviates How It Ends' tendency to steer towards more well-trodden road movie beats. Those well-trodden beats start popping up around the halfway mark and they don't stop, with plenty of antagonistic characters stalling or stopping the quest for the most overplayed reasons such as: A. Not caring that the world is ending, B. Wanting to use the female of the group for... reasons, or C. Random crashes for the sake of an action set piece. A lot less thought went into the middle of the movie than the beginning, but definitely more than the end, which is just a slap in the face for a nearly two-hour trip that it's almost offensive. But between start and end lay some solid spectacles and a few genuinely human moments.The Technics: For as needless as it is to say, I'll point it out anyway: the script is the biggest fault of How It Ends. What should be a thoroughly compelling adventure interwoven with human drama is instead a half measure of each with some distracting action scenes and an annoying character that serves no purpose in the grand scheme. Some scenes merely observing the end of the world are absorbing thanks to very good visual presentation and take some weight off of the overlong runtime that had multiple routes to travel to get to a presentable ending that should've served as the big ""oomph"" to end on. Pacing is another issue here, with the quiet moments holding more impact and the blips of outright action and action-adjacent cliches feeling like Rosenthal jingling keys in front of the audience to make sure they don't think about the missed opportunities.Half a movie resides in the runtime of one complete feature. Some good characters exist but don't get tapped into. Some good adventurous sequences dare to be quiet, and others get loud out of desperation. The setup is much better than the payoff. How It Ends is fifty percent of a-50/100.",How It Ends

I don't know why some commenters complained about having no ending? The film ended just when it should have. The entire plot was about going to find his girlfriend, his journey over there was most of the film. Eventually when he got to Seattle the film basically got it conclusion, and I thought the ending was good. Maybe people thought the film had to discover what the disasters were, but I think it is interesting that they did not say and it was ok not to reveal. You are in the shoes of the characters and they have no idea. Also, it showed very well how people were absolutely untrustworthy, whereas sometimes you might run into a good family.

First of all, I find that a weird choice, surely they would just wait to see what really happened and even wait for her to come to them, where it seemed much safer. Okay so accepting that, within just 1 bloody day the whole of society has broken down. Petrol (gas) has suddenly run out, all food water has vanished, people have turned into looting gangs, risking their lives for the contents of one car!Anyway the film takes its time to get to a weird time, where it just ends.My assumption was that this was a metaphorical reflection of the main characters insecurities.

57,chi_town_fed,Mad Max Meets National Lampoon's Vacation,5,1 August 2018,"Great cinematography in many parts of the movie. Good music score for the dramatic scenes. The same plot replayed throughout the movie like Groundhog's Day and grew tiresome at the third iteration of looking for gasoline (Mad Max) and having the gasoline stolen (Mad Max), and the associated shootouts over the gasoline (Mad Max).For people who don't get it, the issue was visually displayed throughout the movie. An extinction level asteroid (or comet) struck the Pacific Ocean near the Southern Californian coast. This explains the apparent massive global EMP (power outage, loss of GPS satellites, downed commercial aircraft), tectonic plate shifts (earthquakes), volcanic activity, and the massive shift in the magnetic poles (compass swinging, electrical sparks moving down the power line, and northern lights over Washington State).Rikki brought an additional dynamic to the film. I liked her character. Then she simply disappeared (epic-fail). They should have kept her in the movie longer (possibly to the non-end).The last twenty minutes of the movie were the very worst twenty minutes of the movie. Within those last twenty minutes the guy who attempts to steal the ""hero's"" woman made absolutely zero sense and seemed as though his character was tossed into the movie when the writers were stoned out of their minds. What was the deal with him lurking by the hero's truck? He was looking in the passenger side door. I still do not know the purpose of that scene. Then suddenly he was playing with gadgets in the back of the truck. What a stupid scene. I get the outcome was to lead up to the scene in the woods, but what a stupid and clumsy way to get to that last shoot out in the woods. Very anti-climatic which really irritated the audience and cost the movie at least two stars on average in the ratings.There was some good character focus. I give them that. Worth watching if you keep your expectations moderate to low. The ending absolutely sucks.I am tempted to reduce my rating by one star, but I am trying to keep an open mind.

59,stratus_phere,I will be generous,5,14 July 2018,"This is an exciting film that has a lot of good and a lot of bad in it. To start with, you know something bad has happened, something ""end of worldish""...I mean, it's in the title. But what is it? Aliens? Nukes? Meteor? Earthquakes? So the tension is good as the story unfolds and weird stuff happens, and you still don't know.But there are some bad things as well. When it starts, you are amazed at how utterly annoying Forest Whitaker's character is. I've enjoyed him since I first saw him in Fast Times, decades ago. But here he practically wears a sign saying, ""I'm a jerk!"" You hope they will kill him and his sucky wife off soon but sadly realize it's not likely. Both he and his wife are inexcusable and nasty pieces of work. If they were my in-laws I would divorce my wife if she didn't sign a contract to never have contact with them again. I'm not sure what the writers were thinking by introducing them as such horrid people.I was also amazed at how things turned to anarchy almost within minutes of the power going out. A trio of thugs try to rob them at a gas station full of people. Maybe that's NYC, but I would think they would wait until dark, or not so many people, or once the apocalypse has really set in. I mean, NYC has had power outages before and people didn't immediately assume it was the end of the world. Then the character Will has a near hissie fit when he finds out Whitaker has a gun. Seriously? The apocalypse is meant for people willing to fight back, not whine about a scary gun. That made me feel ashamed for the whole film.Then we have them flying down the highway and a fake redneck cop tries to kill them. He really goes out of his way to track them down. Let's think about that for a second. The power has been out for only a day at this point. Surely, if he's decided to start robbing people, he might try something simple, like the locals. Why go to so much trouble to track down and chase down a single car on the highway which may or may not have any loot? I wouldn't waste my time, especially not if I had a cop car and fire power and could blast my way through several encounters with any of the tens of thousands of locals in all the neighboring towns. After that, they end up at a secluded Indian reservation. At this point, you realize they are going through every stereotype of unusual, frightening things a Hollywood writer can dream up about Americana.A few things that really made sense, though. First, they were using ham radios to communicate. That is the most likely scenario in this situation. But it was odd they didn't find any info, since those things can reach around the world without the need for satellites or cell towers. Second, and this is exactly what I would expect, small towns closed off their borders and put armed squadrons on the roads into town. If you recall after the fall of the Roman Empire, when tiny towns throughout Europe were left to fend for themselves, they walled themselves in. That's the way to survived and keep your town safe.In real life, people would have known what happened, there would be no question. It would be on radio and ham radio frequencies around the world. So it was dumb to pretend no one knew. In the end, what hurt this movie the most was the bizarre ending where they're running from it and the credits roll. They never definitively said what caused this world ending scenario, and we never knew if our heroes survived to tell the tale and raise a family in the quiet wilderness. Writers today are never as good as they used to be. They always screw up the ending. I think a 5 out of 10 is generous for this because of the stupid ending...or lack of an ending.",How It Ends

Will is a young lawyer. In love with his pregnant partner Sam. Sams dad Tom isn't so keen on Will. The latter is an ex marine and the men are pretty much polar opposites.Then, when Sam is out west and Will isn't, something happens. All communication with Seattle, where she is, is suddenly lost. Without any knowledge as to what is going on there, all Tom wants to do is get to his daughter and save her. Will naturally wants to come as well. As civilisation in the area starts to come apart very fast, a perilious road trip awaits.You can't fault this for the attempts at realism. It uses it's budget well and there are some very arresting visuals at times. The two lead characters are written as ordinary people. Thus there's perhaps not much to them, but they are convincing creations anyway, and there's enough for the actors to get their teeth into.The film doesn't take place over a very long timescale, even though a fair bit happens, but it does allow them to change somewhat as characters as it goes along, thanks to what happens.This feels like a pretty spot on depiction of how this kind of thing would go,. The lack of information, and the best and worst of humanity all coming out fast. Some action takes place at night, so naturally some bits are a little tricky to see.It does keep you watching, wanting to see how it will end out for them. But then it does falter a little in the last 15 or so mins, as it spends that time not really knowing how to finish. Thus the way it does finally finish will, as you can see from other reviews, give a bit of a reaction. I do like this kind of story though, so all in all, it worked for me.

It is good not knowing what is happening, because in real life you wouldn't.. anxious watchers need the other side to tell them all (like, the government). But for me it's ok not knowing.It looks like a low budget movie, but, you know, you are not paying a cinema ticket for it, so 🤷 at least I can bear whatever you can do with more money, like, more characters, more meteoritical FX, and more FX so you can feel the apocalyptic kind of scenario.Maybe, I'm not in the situation, but people rob you at gunpoint, take you your gas, your group follow them and killed them in an effort to get back the gas, and you have a tantrum in th middle of the road for it? Really? Did they put the woman to balance the morals? I think that part made no sense at all. You are all alone, surrounded by murderers, it is a clear kill or be killed. The resources are low.

If so, I could forgive the incredibly swift decent into anarchy most of the people in this film are directed to display. But the action was forced which didn't work for me.So, I tried to rationalise what would happen if the power is out across the country, communications have been disrupted for 24 hours, and everyone around me has lost their minds, becoming murderers and thieves? I know that anarchy is but 3 missed meals away, but this scenario does not meet that measure. Am I to believe Americans live so close to sanity's edge that their morals disengage, inhibitions are shed and altruism is thrown out the window within hours of their 'normality' being disrupted?I would believe people being very concerned, wary and confused during such a time. Miscommunication, opinions and lies would spread throughout local areas, and neighbours would begin to band together or segregate during several days of high uncertainty.Panic buying and attempts to retrieve money from bank accounts are also likely. Escalations of emotional collapse may then trigger violence and widespread unrest as the crisis continued over several days. And society might well unravel given a lack of government enforcement and aid. But, it doesn't happen overnight.Didn't understand the cop that wasn't a cop who wanted to kill the main characters. Didn't get the mechanic going for a drive with two bloodied maniacs who'd arrived in a shot up cop car and smashed caddie (her own reasoning that she reversed within seconds). Didn't get the family who'd been through their own hell picking up an armed hitchhiker (since at this late stage we are expected to suspend our moral attitudes, heighten our suspicions and over inflate threat assessments).Yes, an action movie must push on.

We really don't get much backstory on the main characters, especially the relationship between James and Graham before he's off on a plane to Chicago. We get one brief conversation between Whitaker, James, and Nicole Ari Parker, who plays Whitaker's wife and Graham's mother, and then disaster strikes. Next thing you know, Whitaker and James are in a spiffy Caddy headed west. Nothing much of interest happens in between although director Rosenthal tries his best.For one thing, I simply just can't buy into James and Whitaker traveling cross country together. I think it all leads back to thin character development. This also prevents me from caring too much about the mission they're on, especially when they have to kill other people to save a character we only saw for the first couple of minutes.Regarding the action in between--it just isn't enough to get past the boring characters and flat script and visuals--mostly because we've seen it all before in disaster/apocalyptic films.",How It Ends

The typical ""need to save someone"" road trip full of danger and betrayal. Most of it is pretty cliche and expected, which is a shame. As the cast is good, it's just the writing that's pretty lackluster.It has the typical slow build up, with a lot of questions, gets in to a decent pace... and then just stops. Not even one of ""endings full of questions"" types of endings, but the movie literally stops in the middle of a big scene... and cuts to credits. It makes no sense. Perhaps they were expecting to make a sequel that picked up right where the first left off... but even still, it's a terrible way to end a movie.It would be like Star Wars getting up to the battle at the Deathstar, you see the fighters flying in... and then just credits. The horrifically bad choice of how to end the movie really destroys it. It's not like we were given any sort of answers to anything that's been going on.Overall, I'd say give this film a pass. What might be some interesting bits just get ruined by being cut off without reason. There's no point in starting to watch a film and stopping just before the ending, so this movie basically becomes a waste of time.",How It Ends

They meet a collection of characters and must also try to discover the cause of the apocalyptic event. Based on that description, it could easily also star Kevin Hart - but it doesn't.The film tries hard to be dark and foreboding, and that is where this film fails. The film is not a piece of art such as The Road, it laps up cliche, and always leaves us wanting more. It does a poor job of filling in the numerous holes and I can imagine the directors trying to have the focus not be on the event and focusing on the human condition of the survivors, yet the film also rubs our noses in the 'mystery' of the apocalyptic event. There is some quality here, and there are moments of good interaction that make this film worthy of a watch. I wish the focus were these interactions and connections instead of the bland plot. The actors do well with what is given to them, and the action and effects are passable. At other moments the film drags and forgets it's focus. This film has ok elements to it.

Spoiler Alert - the film just ends abruptly and awkwardly, and credits roll. No one in production (who is not on heavy meds) could have thought that this was going to work.Compounding the ending issue is the film's final scene preceding the credits - oddly, the only truly dumb scene in the movie, wherein the protagonists somehow outrun a massive explosive cloud of deadly gas (moving at the rapid speed that such massive explosive clouds must travel) in a 4-wheel-drive vehicle along a winding mountain road. Uh huh...Did everyone just quit and walk off this production? Did the film exceed time and budget limits? Was production stopped by investors (""you have a half day left to complete the film's ending, and then we pull the plug people - Chop chop!!"")One is left hanging and it is super awkward - It is not cool, nor witty, nor a neat play on words with the title.

But the scriptwriting let it down. I felt they must have used a 15 year old who thinks everyone says ""f..."" every second sentence. Such poverty of vocab and a seeming necessity to have all characters say it made it utterly laughable.
Plus the annoying plot holes, eg - you have a nervous driver, driving at speed at night, with no lights on, its extremely dangerous and he takes his eyes off the road to try and look at a compass. Yep, the plot needed a car crash.
The overall idea was good but it needed an editor who would have cut at least 50% of the swearing, not have the driver act like an idiot just to progress the story and to not leave it quite so up in the air.

From this perspective you would not know what the nature of the disaster is unless you could see (and even then you might be nine the wiser) or you received information from the government or media.I think the fact that people were stealing from each other or killing each other is exactly what would happen in such a circumstance.

This film starts out with an event that is not explained but causes a complete shut down of society and it quickly goes into ""every man for himself"" mode. The protagonist, Will, has to get from Chicago to Seattle to get to his wife with the help of his Father-in-law who supposedly spent many years in the military. Hard to tell this as none of his training comes into play and he is not a great deal of help....until he dies.
They travel on backroads as the interstates are dangerous...they say but we do not see why. Each small town offers another situation to deal with more weirdos and wanting to keep them out or steal the car of just get the gas they have on board. Those Caddilac CTS's must be very good on fuel as they never fill up after the 1st time and still have a full gas can in the truck all the way. Every time they have a gun fight they don't seem to get more weapons on bullets but still have more for the next fight. I truly dislike when directors don't have characters make real decisions where they would grab every gun and bullet they can get their hands on as ...who know!!

The character arc of Will is marked as he goes from your average-joe city lawyer who has never shot a gun to a seasoned road warrior willing to kill in order to protect his girlfriend and unborn child at the slightest provocation. Isn't that the point of this film; to show how far he grows in just a few short days with the training and support of his girlfriend's father on a dangerous road trip?I think the apocalypse event was a geomagnetic pole reversal in which most of the earth's protective atmosphere is eroded. This would have catastrophic effects, and apparently there is at least one scientist who thinks we are due for one (if you google it) .... Support in the film: Electrical grid collapses across the entire US right away. Uniform unreliable communications capabilities (radio, internet), also within a day of the event in LA/West Coast. GPS doesn't work (that seems like a big clue to me!) Birds fly in circles. A compass needle can't find North as it just spins. Storms are insanely strong and frequent. There's an Aurora light show in the night sky in August. Temperatures soar such that a big pool of water isn't cool, but hot like a jacuzzi. Planes are grounded. The ones that do fly crash for no apparent reason. Trains crash for no apparent reason. Tsunamis. Volcanic events. Should I go on? I kind of liked how the director/writer kept us in the dark just like the characters... it added to the tension and credibility of what seems to us to be bizarre actions.Another reviewer wondered where all the roadside fires were coming from. I assumed it was from lighting strikes from the strong storms. They showed lots of lighting at several points in the film. And one of the characters mentioned how they'd been more frequent and intense since the electrical grid fried.The only criticism I have is that I thought Americans devolved into murderous self-absorbed hoodlums rather quickly (within a day or two), but who knows; maybe a loss of the earths protective atmosphere would affect people's mental sanity, too, the way if fries electrical equipment? Also, without communications and services, people are probably going insane not knowing what's happening and go straight into survival mode. For those without any cash or supplies sticked away, you might do just about anything to survive another day? Think about all the TP hoarded at the first mention of the Corona Virus this year ...I thought it was a great film. I didn't even mind the ending that everyone else hated so much ... it shows the main character driving off with his girl to the North where they will survive at least one more day.

Grace Dove plays one of the more memorable side characters who adds some comedy into the film and then she just leaves.

Whitacers wife in the movie was at first going with them on this trip cuz they were all going to the car and then next clip shes nowhere in sight and we don't see her the rest of the movie.

138,parkerrodney,"Small Budgets make for Lame Endings, a shame",3,5 August 2018,"In ""How it Ends"" the story relies upon the theme of an unknown apocalyptic event which drives a father to drive from California to Chicago in search of his daughter. The father played by Forest Whitaker, is accompanied by his daughter's fiancé, played by Theo James, and a young female mechanic which they met along the way. Like many collapse movies, ""How it ends,"" attempts to portray the essence of human behavior when the grid goes down and humans are forced to kill or be killed as they struggle to survive. 
The sub-plot behind ""How it Ends,"" is about relationships. It's about the bond and love a father has for his daughter and the attempt of her fiancé to win his approval for marriage. The road trip, though fraught with danger, is an attempt at reconciliation of a missing daughter and bond building of a strained relationship between father and son-in-law to be.The movie has some obvious loose ends that it didn't bother clean up. While it is plausible and somewhat expected that father would succumb to injuries which he sustained during their travel and we know that James will likely find his girlfriend played by Nicole Ari Parker, it stretches the imagination that his girlfriend would somehow be hiding out in a house with a male neighbor who ""saved"" her. Further that the neighbor, turned out to be a psycho with an obsession with the beautiful Parker, and planned to kill James, but ends up getting killed by James. This entire section of the feels like randomly inserted into the movie to serves no other purpose other than to kill time. It is lame and gratuitous and serves as evidence that writers had no idea where to take this movie at this point. In an attempt to jazz it up with this psycho, they revealed their hand at poor script writing. The psycho played well by Mark O' Brien, may have been a nice touch had it been a central to the main plot. There are other confusing issues, but I won't bother to mention them as they are annoying. 
 Many people say complain about the ending. I can't imagine the movie ending any other way, the two running away being chased by the bogeyman so to speak. The ending is weak and lame, but anytime you have an apocalyptic movie where the origin is unknown, and is never revealed, what kind of ending can you really expect?While it's possible to make a good movie on a low budget, it is very difficult to do so. Great movies require a strong investment in every aspect of the production. If there is a correlation between budget and greatness, then ""How it Ends,"" at a 20 million-dollar budget, had the odds against it from the beginning.

Well something happen on the West coast while Theo James is chatting with his GF /Kat Graham about another missed opportunity to talk (about wedding and pregnancy )with her father/F.Whitaker (who doesn't like him much), in Chicago, when a black out occur and they lose contact.
In a matter of hours,
all planes are grounded,Seattle is now on another planet, so, he has to go back to Sam's parent to learn that Tom will drive to find his daughter back, with or without him.From there it's a kind of apocalyptic road trip which I found a little (very little) bit slow paced, from dumb looters to armed militia on the road, visiting surviving friends, the US army has closed the only one highway so it'll take a few days to reach Seattle, but it's definitely well made. F.Whitaker isn't a GI joe, an ex Seal or special others forces, he is just a Vet, who can see a threat when his stepson lawyer wants to help everyone or get in trouble along the way.In fact, I must say it's one of the most relevant movie in this genre since a long time,
Take the US, a catastrophic event followed by a total blackout, no news, every network shutted down, only rumours of ""korea did this, Russia did that, or China may be"" and half of the country will be in the street armed to the teeth.The end in fact is perfect, I don't get the problem with it, is it because you don't know what or who cause this? who cares it's not the point.

Little tidbits dropped here and there about what the mysterious disaster is but ultimately nobody in the film knows, nor did the director or writer apparently. Without having the characters confront the core problem directly makes this just another difficult road film. It could be about anything - a groom having to get to his wedding on time after being stuck half a continent away for instance. That would have been a lot cheaper to produce and likely would have resulted in a better film with real characters we care about.Funny thing, as soon as disaster struck, the film's ""look"" immediately shifted to hazy yellow just like any rotten apocalyptic film does (except for those taking place in icy conditions - those are always blue). It's a law in Hollywood, punishable by, well, never mind.What a waste of viewing time.

It wasn't, it was about how ordinary people might try to react to any kind of catastrophe, and how it might create situations in which people may discover much more about them selves and each other than the could in the normal world. That arc was resolved.

Ok maybe it was 2 days, or hell, I'll be generous and say 3 or 4 days. Then there's a downed airliner that, well, wasn't even flying because ALL FLIGHTS WERE CANCELLED EVERYWHERE.

The rest just served their purpose but nothing special acting wise. The dialogue is lazy written and there's nothing spectacular about it. The ending however, without spoiling, is a real pisser as it reminds me of another Netflix disaster, Open House. Of course Open House was trillion times worse but the ending had the same feel as if the director literally had to be somewhere else and cut the scene. One could argue that the disasters themselves are self explanatory but in this case it is not done well. We are supposed to watch a movie not play a game of guessing things. In the end, this could've been a fantastic film but the producers, writers and director were very lazy to even attempt making this great.",How It Ends

175,drm2642,Why all the Bad Reviews?,10,8 August 2018,"This movie is really a 7 out of 10, but I gave it a 10 to help out the average. I think all the negative reviews are pretty unfair and are purely a result of the movie's abrupt ending. This obviously angered people and caused them to rage review! The acting is good. Forest Whitaker, as always is excellent. The story is interesting. The movie doesn't overly drag at any point and personally, I felt compelled to watch until the end. Are there parts that are unrealistic? Sure, but it's a movie! Everything isn't going to always fit into a nice, neat little box.The big issue that this movie has is the director and/or writer does not do enough to explain to the audience what exactly is going on. He gives enough clues though that it is easy to figure out if you stop and think about it. Let's break this down:
1. There is seismic and volcanic activity going on off the west coast. It is mentioned that California and particularly L.A. is gone. At first we are meant to think that this could have been nukes, but the end of the movie makes it pretty clear that this is volcanic in nature. This would also explain why one of the characters in the movie says the air is bad and they are heading to Canada.
2. The compass acting weird.
3. The Aurora Borealis in Seattle. While I've heard this is technically possible it is exceedingly rare.
4. The power grid going down.
5. The birds acting all weird.
All of these things point to the magnetic poles shifting. Now from the research I've done a pole shift would NOT cause volcanic/seismic activity, but for the sake of this being a borderline science fiction movie this can be forgiven. Also, since we didn't really live during the last pole shift we really don't 100% know what would happen. The compass going nuts and the Northern Lights though are meant to be an indication of this. Technically the power grid could go down if this happened at the same time as a massive solar flare. It would take a series of perfect disasters for this to occur, but the point is it could happen. I think the director should have done a bit more to convey this to the audience though. The crazy guy that saves the main character's GF, for example, could have been some sort of scientist who explained this away and had prior knowledge, which in turn could have helped to explain how they got out of the city right before all the really bad stuff went down.
Like I said, there are problems with the movie. What caused the military train to break down? Where are all the people in the Midwest? (For a hot minute I was afraid this was going to turn into a biblical story.) Why does Rickie join the duo just to end up running off? And of course the size of the volcanic eruption at the end is stupid-dumb. I mean that thing would have to be a borderline super volcano to erupt all the way from Seattle to where the characters were at the end. So like I said originally, this movie is about a 7 out of 10 because there were too many questions and not enough answers. It's not the low score though that everyone is giving it!",How It Ends

Every person they come across in the Midwest is portrayed by redneck-vigilante types. Sorry Hollywood, I've traveled through those states, you can do better than that. I've found the people in the Midwest to very personable, intelligent hard-working people. Lastly, it felt like the screen writers decided that they needed a vacation so after a long buildup of a whole lot of nothing, the climactic scene too is a whole lot of nothing.

It just feels forced and absolute nonsense. Action scenes where our main character can't fight a skinny guy but in other scenes he can suddenly drive a car like a stuntman and other scenes fight back. So idiotic!

I think it's a movie that contains nothing but its premise. You can make a decent film out of human reactions to incomprehensible events, it has been done.

There isn't a genuine human reaction to each other or the situation from start to finish. (Or not finished, in this case.) Whatever is going on, these characters are not responding to it in a convincing way.Strangers meeting in the early stages of a disaster are mostly just going to want to TALK to each other - not kill each other, because hey, gas shortage, amiright?Baffled, scare humans exchange news. Even if we have no real news to exchange, we try. We gossip and speculate. But not these characters! They seem weirdly at peace with what's going on. It's strange and awful, but what are you going to do? It is what it is, whatever it is. Why ask questions? Just keep going, we've got an ending to avoid!I couldn't stop watching, unfortunately, because it seemed like there had to be a payoff of some kind coming. It might be weak.

One of the lowest points, for me, around 1 hour into the movie, when one character, who seems like a transgender bad ass, bad mouth kid, suddenly bursts out in tears about dealing with a situation. Rolling my eyes for most of the time during the movie. Jason Statham is your typically nerd person that desperately needs approval from his father-in-law and evolves in a true hero that can shoot without aiming, drive like the best car racer, be an outstanding doctor and is a smart as Mac Guyver.

Was there no more money to shoot a proper ending? Did it not make the cutting board? We will never know. But it sucks like hell (excuse the language). This kind of movie is really not possible in 2018 anymore. We need a good script, good acting and a plot twist that keeps you wondering about a movie.

The character's actions are meant to move the plot along until said cataclysmic event unfolds. Aside from setting up that there is such an event this movie goes no further. It might as well have been any ""road trip gone wrong"" generic movie instead. All the encounters are completely uninspired and ""traditional"". You've got your crazies who love the new chaos because they like to hurt people, you have your distrustful but good people, you have your forced-to-be-bad in order to survive people, etc. Nothing new, nothing even vaguely interesting.As for the ending, everyone is talking about how abruptly it ends and indeed it does.

Most of the people they do meet are gun-toting hillbilliess or (maybe) escaped prisoners all intent on killing them and stealing their car. Most of the trip seems to happen in the dark with loud ambient music covering up the limited dialog. When the sun does rise we are treated to a highlight reel of some of the US's most beautiful landscapes, suddenly devoid of people.

Some punks attempt to hijack them for cash or whatever, and Dad goes to trunk, pulls gun out of luggage. Hmmmm.

He's intimidating, warm, and as brilliant as usual, throughout this movie.Theo James had a pretty decent character arc, and it suited the story. His transition from hopeless boyfriend to a ""man"" was well scripted. Now for the rest. Somehow Netflix managed to take a brilliant premise (well for fans of eotw movies), and turn it into a meandering road movie. It starts out strong but then limps through at least 60 minutes of not very much happening. There are some true moments of tension, but the writers obviously decided to give us a Cohen Brothers ending instead. That's fine if you're the Cohen Brothers and it's expected but not in a movie like this.Cliffhangers work for sequels, but felt forced here. Really forced. Like the entire movie was written with it in mind. Bad move.You do not find out what the cause of the apocalypse was, with hints that it could be natural or man-made in nature. A little bit of background (coming across some science guy who had warned of impending danger) would have tied up that open loop in a cheesy but practical way. Like Forrest W's character comments about F22s doing fly-bys, but then that's it. We see military equipment destroyed and a downed jet...but no explanation as to how or why. There's a whole lot of ""oh look...crazy stuff happened""...and then the movie just continues on without providing any clarity. That's a sign of truly bad storytelling.There are a number of ridiculous plot holes, especially one scene where the lead character is entering Seattle.

Paid + Joaquin Phoenix = Good Movie.
Should have because I paid for it rather than watch NetFlix which in my home is free. And How It Ends was on Netflix.
My point? For a free movie, I personally was very pleased with the non-stop action, light drama, excellent acting, and well so-so story. 
Keep in mind, IT WAS FREE.
So I give it a solid 8 out of 10. 
Forest Whitaker, a heavyweight (pun) of an actor carries most of the film. He carries it by acting while performing an action while intertwined in the drama of a quasi science fiction, post apocalyptic landscape.
Keep in mind, IT WAS FREE.
So I give it a solid 8 out of 10. 
You Were Never Really Here has none of that.
Keep in mind, I PAID FOR THAT.
I gave that crumb a solid 3 out of 10.
The point being, I was surprised that I found a movie on a Saturday night, on Netflix, Free, with only one big named actor and it was pretty good.
Nope, it will not win awards like Mr. Phoenix may for YWNRH, but I was fun and kept my interest almost until the end.
Surviving post apocalyptic America, be it zombies, earthquakes, or aliens, is popular with audiences. 
Add that IT WAS FREE and I gave it a solid 8 out of 10. 
So, for those smart film critics out there, I give you this to ponder before you criticize this movie.
I dare you, DARE you to watch You Were Never Really Here after paying for it (relax, just pretend you did).
Then critically consider a freebee NetFlix movie like How It Ends. 
Compare, contrast and consider why this little gem could not cast an 8?

Just like somebody else said; I like to make my own opion about a movie, as it usually happens that I dislike the huge blockbusters, but like the small movies. Even if they are badly reviewed (It could also say something about my taste in movies, but okay).Anyway, I liked this movie. It surprised me how much I liked it. The mystery, the unknown. Yeah sure, after a while a got a bit tired of the road trip stuff. But it wasn't bad. Some moments really reminded me of The Walking dead and I almost expected a Zombie invasion to show up. 
Sure, it had some cliche's, but the movie worked for me.
Even the ending. After reading the reviews I had prepared myself for the worst. Like the movie ending in the middle of a scene, in the middle of a sentence. But this ending wasn't bad and to me it felt like an ending.
Okay yeah, we don't know what will happen to the characters, we don't know if they eventually survived. But does that really matter?

Its and unknown event causing nuclear winter and massive tectonic/volcanic disturbance, told from the view of the survivors. , nothing wrong with that.

They find an abandoned crashed military train full to the brim with vehicles, fuel, likely weapons, food and equipment. They are a military veteran and a young man. Instead of grabbing a humvee and loading it for bear, they get back into their broken ass car to continue on their way. Who in their right mind would do such a thing?

But when you have a film like this with big names - like Academy Award winner Forest Whitaker - you would expect something of better caliber. But that's not the case here.Whitaker seemed to do this as a favor or for the paycheck. Theo James was alright, but I've seen him do better. What was Grace Dove (Ricki) there for...eye candy? If so, she's like those funky orange and black wrapped things you pray you don't get at Halloween.So the film starts out pretty much as expected. Man is in love with a girl and wants to marry her. Man has to ask the father. Father hates the guy. Mother tries to be an intermediary. DISASTER STRIKES and suddenly everyone is fine with working together.But then the trip takes too dang long... At most, a drive from Chicago to Seattle would take about 3 days tops. I don't know where this film's writer is from, but he needs a lesson on geography. 6 freaking days? That's just lazy writing, even with Tom's demise and Will burning the car. And speaking of...what the frak? THAT made no sense at all whatsoever.As we travel with the Odd Couple across the ""United States,"" we're treated to typical post-apocalyptic scenes of run down, graffiti-ed gun-toting, hillbilly infested yokels trying very hard to reenact Mad Max with gas suddenly being the ultimate commodity after less than a week.Seattle looking like it got his by a tsunami (the boat in the middle of town), a nuclear bomb (EVERYTHING blown out), AND a volcano (raining ash) all at once? That's some next level alien invasion/annihilation attack or something. One disaster at a time, bro...And then that ending. Wow...so that's ""how it ends?"" With Will indiscriminately killing the neighbor that saved his pregnant girlfriend and the happy couple driving off trying to outrun what looks like yet another volcanic eruption coming at them? I was half expecting their kiss to be the last thing you see before they get swallowed up by the fallout and their truck explodes. At least that would have been an ending I could have lived with knowing that their love endured and they didn't give up on each other even in the face of certain death. But no...they survive...And with that, we don't find out ""How It Ends.""

Yes there were issues, the world turned to hell pretty quick, but lets face it, it is not real time and we do not have six months to wait for people to become eat or be eaten types. When the end approaches, you're left with an open ended movie, with the burning question being, what caused this in the first place. Here is your answer, the little hints throughout the film, volcanoes, earthquakes, a compass going crazy, no power, and the aurora borealis all the way down in Seattle and some climate change (excessive heatwaves). There is thus an issue with the Earth's magnetic field. Some people believe global cataclysm will occur when Earth's magnetic poles reverse. When north goes south, they say, the continents will lurch in one direction or the other, triggering massive earthquakes, rapid climate change and species extinctions. This isn't true, and there is no proof, but there lies the premise of the film. The cause of the planet being harmed, our lives destroyed, is a magnetic field reversal, with all of its symptoms (some true and some maybe not so true). This happens with people going ""primal"" quickly as we only have an hour and a bit. The leads were fine, they carried a simple story through to finality, and perhaps the world did end? Or, some people survived. But hey, it was beautifully shot, lovely action pieces, and not altogether a bad effort. You can thank me for explaning the cause of the earth's issues.",How It Ends

I made an account just to comment about How it Ends since the rating dropped absurdly. COME on people. Part 2 has been announced it was clear that the story wont remain in such a big cliffhanger.
I am gonna say that this is not the best or the most decent movie you can entertain your evening/night with, the special effects are really not that impressive and it looks like they decided for a part 2 half way into the movie when they realized its too much of an idea for just one part. I have nothing bad to say about the acting, personally i liked it.
Plot holes ? There is just the beginning of the plot so there are no holes since it literally did not go trough with anything. The suspense is there, in some parts, but it couldve been way more well written. It was not tho.
The reason i like this movie is because i do not think there would be one thing i would do different as a survivors in a post apocalyptic picture like this.
The mistery regarding everything that is going on gives little room for better acting. I personally think that everyone actually gave their best for what they got to work with.
IF you like post apocalyptic movies, this will suit you. Warning tho, it tends to get quite boring at times. Predictable ? HELL no ! Since you cant predict that a movie will end without any explanation.
A lot of people hated the end, myself included, but the director just did it so they could make us interested in part 2. I do not think id watch it if the plot would be even remotely hinted at in the first movie.
This being said, all in all, acting was good given the weak script.
The movie idea is not out of the box (yet) but has great potential for a part 2 to be AMAZING. Now, obviously im expecting too much, but i do because its so much room to wiggle with .
7/10 only because of the hate from the comments.
Yes, its not the best, hell, its not even the top 10( post apocalyptic movies) for me, but, its not the worst, and its not something to avoid at all cost like other post apocalyptic movies.",How It Ends

They are just ordinary people living through a disaster where they have no phones or radio and no way of knowing what has happened, or what the government or military are doing to help, or what will happen next. All they know is that they want to get to their beloved family members despite everything. So that being said, not all of my questions were answered just like many other reviewers, simply because the characters also do not know.So I think it was a great movie, definitely worth checking out.

With that said, while I love how NetFlix keeps going full steam ahead on sci fi, ffs this is predictable. This is one of those movies where one of the main characters tries to prove over and over how dumb he is. On the other hand it was nice to see Forest Whitaker have a stout performance after several years of horrible performances. I dont know though, if this was something that was a theater release, I might have dropped a star or two.

Shows the development of the relationship between father-in-law and son-in-law.

324,lindsncal,NO ENDING? THE WHOLE MOVIE SHOWS YOU EXACTLY HOW IT ALL ENDS. ...,9,14 July 2018,"....When the climate gets warmer....every nuanced strange little thing to every disaster in the movie is what happens. 
I'm so glad I ignored the reviews from so many that didn't seem to get it. 
This movie, in my opinion, was next to genius, and with a bigger budget and something that would have made it easier for non thinkers to understand the message, it could have been big box office...but the writer didn't compromise by using the usual Hollywood ending with a muscle bound hero and everybody saved. I'm impressed.We have been warned by scientists for a few decades about the planet being in big trouble and there's evidence all over the world. However, it's mostly ignored ...and pretty much only in the U S because of current politics and a no information media. There are millions of displaced people already suffering from it around the world that we don't hear about here.How It Ends...is actually how it all could possibly end and is what this movie is about. It's the culmination of different possible events and what could happen to people going through them...fighting for resources and survival, thievery, loss of a moral compass, etc. It's a perfect title and perfect ending that should leave people with a sense of dread about what is happening and could happen to all of us...but instead people complained that there was no ending. Because the end wasn't given to us with a pink ribbon around it and everybody saved with happy faces, people didn't understand it and called it a 'no ending'. 
The whole movie was showing you the end using real people scenarios of what could happen in real life. The acting was good as well as the special effects.When you saw the compass going nuts and the unusual aurora sky, those are signs that the magnetic poles are changing. What that causes is a major loss of electricity, satellite feedback, etc..hence...no cell phones, tv/radio or lights, etc., as you saw in the movie. The writer did not specify what type of disasters we may face because of the climate warming up so he used different scenarios...earthquakes, lack of fresh water (a big one already happening in the world), fires, tsunamis (caused by large displacement of water from volcanic eruptions, underwater explosions, landslides, glacier destruction, etc.)
He used them as general possibilities of disasters and we should all be paying attention.We need more movies like How It Ends.",How It Ends

I don't understand why the other reviews go on and on about the movie not having an ending. The whole movie is about the ending, as the world crumbles there is no chance of outrunning it and there is no where for the characters to go. This is...... how it ends.
There is a decent explanation theory given at the end about what caused it but part of the point in the movie is that no one knows exactly what happened. Th movie is about how the average Joe dealt with it happening and the average Joe is not going to know the true exact cause when communications are gone.
Now for the negatives- the characters of this movie have apparently never watched apocalyptic movies as they make a number of dopey decisions that the father in laws years as a marine should have taught him better.

The trailer promised so much but they then padded the rest of the film with ludicrous plodding dialogue and scenes. The main characters seemed to have completely lost who they are and all sense of reason. Whilst I could understand people being driven to extremes after months of struggling to survive this appears to happen in a matter of hours and the main protagonists go from law abiding office workers to gun toting maniacs who can spin cars around on a two lane bridge whilst shooting ""bad guys"" out of car windows at speed (having only picked up a gun for the first time that week).
They are also responsible for the death of two people who ""stole"" their fuel (fuel they had technically stolen from someone else). Fuel they needed or they ""would die"". Really!!! And what does the main character do when his father in law dies and the car breaks down - pours the fuel over the car and sets it on fire!! Why!! Surely he would have taken the fuel or stashed it if was so precious.

I was really disappointed in how it ended. I think that's how it earned it's title.
""How it ends"" 
I'm now left thinking, 'exactly...how is that? How does it end?'Can anyone tell me?With massive continental aftermath of who knows what with governmental teams and downed plains, derailed trains in perfect weather....no electricity but cars with computers still driving...random earthquakes, weird storms...people loosing their minds, going psychotic as we all can expect in the end of the world...but is it? And is anywhere else affected or isnit just the US? Where did the jets go to? Why was military machinery ditched and left for the taking as we later see a derailed train?
And from what exactly?
Tsunamis? volcanos? Earths poles switching? Magnetic fields all askew? Aliens? Act of warfare? The world's plates shifting? Solar flares or forces bigger than even that?Anything...?I was satisfied to see that Theo's Trendy character gained a few brain cells through his journey. He was rather useless and stupid at first, but we all must admit, some people would be quite naive to the situations unfolding and how to deal with it. That's not unrealistic.
I liked that He seemed to grow as a character through the movie, that much was fine.
But then what?
It all just leaves the majority of each issue introduced into the film then left completely unanswered and open ended.THAT was VERY Dissatisfying.
Let me give you an idea similar in the frustration of if:
-------
*imagine; the world's best American football game playing out, thrilling and each time so close! One gets ahead, then the other, and it's now the 3rd quarter and DONE! Everything just up and stopped right at the end of the third quarter with each team only 7 points apart! But it's over! Done! Quitting with a full quarter left in the game and everyone starts walking away, leaving the game unfinished. Questions of, who would have won left hanging in the air.
**Or here's another example: It's like being called into your boss's office, how nerve wracking is that? So you go, sit down. Your boss looks serious, a file on their desk, your name on it and you think, 'I'm going to get fired today...'
The Boss then starts telling you about your work and achievements, going on, while you nervously wait for the ""but""...and hour goes by and you wait....the boss keeps talking about you and then drops a hint, asking how you feel about your position and if you're doing the best you can. You wonder, if you were going to get fired, why even bring up the achievements? Maybe it's a raise? Maybe it's just the buffer before the bad news? But before you can answer, WHAM! The boss suddenly ends the meeting, tells you to go and you don't even know why they asked you there in the first place, wasting an hour of your time and left wondering if your job is on the line. 
--------I get open ended movies leaving a few questions unanswered, but this whole movie seemed pointless. It presented problems, possibilities, potential sources to the issues and things to theorize on.
Then it leaves you with absolutely NOTHING to even try to answer for it all with....I will admit...there was one answered question:
Was his girlfriend alive? Only question answered. Even that whole situation revolving around her survival and such was weird and lacking details.
So?
Will there be a second????!!!!!!!!
If not, I would rate this only 2 stars.

 Beyond that, everything else is in the perspective of the main character. This was an ""I have to get to my girl"" movie, not an explanation as to how the world ends. Aside from some continuity, or goofs issues, he got to his girl. In my opinion, the only part that should have been omitted,was Jeremiah's attempted murder of Will. 
 As to the over all cause of this... world ending event, the biggest clue for me was at the end. After having reached the Seattle area, he looks up and sees the northern lights quite vividly.

I can usually ""...suspend with the best of 'em..."". However, this movie's convoluted, threadbare and hackneyed plot devices require that we not merely ""...suspend disbelief..."", but positively ""...string it up and Lynch it...""!Further, I'm all for ""Character Development"" and ""Exploring The Interactions Of The Human Condition"", but THAT wasn't very successfully handled, either. Plus, there's only so much contrived, intentional, patently-manipulative ""...mystification, strictly for the sake of mystification..."" that I'm willing to put up with, without, eventually, being handed a few solid ANSWERS, as a kind of ""payoff"" for my patience. Considering the nearly-two-hour run of this production, there was plenty of room for a TALENTED directorial team to do all of the ""artsy"" stuff they wanted, AND just tell the damned story, too, while satisfying their urge to do a lot of ""pointless-skulking-about-to-allegedly-suspense-enhancing-soundtrack-music""!They just didn't bother...So many gaping, inexplicable (...or, at least, unexplained...), plot-holes, so little screen-space; where to begin? Perhaps where the screenwriter and director SHOULD have begun - with the simplest, most basic, grade-school-level understanding of ""How Stuff Works""?There is not the LEAST chance that ANY form of ""localized disaster"" on the West Coast could take out the power grid much further east than, MAYBE, Denver, let alone Chicago a few minutes after... whatever this ""nigh-onto-magical"" nonsense was. If Saint Helens were to blow her top again, lighting up ALL of the Cascade Range volcanoes and cracking-loose the whole length of the San Andreas, the geo-mechanical effects would largely slam into The Rockies and ricochet back West. The entire state of California could slide into the Pacific, taking the left half of The Cascades with it, and all Chicago'd know about it, at first, is what showed up on their seismographs.So, although the plot's dismal, and apparently deliberate, utter lack of cogent exposition left the ""Jeremiah"" character (...we meet him in the final Act...) neither provably right nor provably wrong about his ""offshore nuclear detonation"" postulate, he was both dead-right about the ""computer virus"" part of his ""paranoid conspiracy theory"", AND dead-wrong in his assumption that any SINGLE virus could shut down ALL the many and varied, RADICALLY DIFFERENT power generation systems involved (...nuclear, hydro, solar, wind, coal, oil - to name only the most obvious...)....and ALL the satellite arrays, including GPS?!?!? Oh, COME ON!!!Did I hear somebody say, ""But... um... er... um... EMP!""...?Nope! Any form of electromagnetic effect attenuates AT LEAST with the square of the distance, not counting intermittently-metal-bearing obstructions like, say, The Rockies, for instance. So, again, if it originates at the West Coast, it ends around Denver-ish, at the absolute outside. And if we hypothesize some sort of weaponized, orbital, James-Bondian, SPECTRE-esque, ""mega-EMP"" device? That, in and of itself, would've precluded the driving of ANY motor vehicle with electronic fuel injection or an onboard computer (...i.e., anything more recent than about 1976...) - either system, except ""hardened"" military ones, would be completely FRIED by any pulse powerful enough to take out the power grid and satellite arrays.Then, even if we could ""...suspend disbelief..."" enough to accept any (...or all!) of these various preposterous premises, there is still not the SLIGHTEST possibility that ALL radio and television stations, continent-wide, including Canada and Mexico, would be taken off the air, instantly and permanently, even by such a massive event as... whatever this ""nigh-onto-magical"" nonsense was. Ever since 9/11, very nearly EVERY broadcast station that throws more than about 250 Watts has their own on-site generator, which is more than capable of running them, at full power, for at least a week, and is NOT part of any nationwide computer-networked ""grid"". Clueless, they might be, with little or no useful information to impart to the public about ""Whiskey-Tango-Foxtrot just happened?!?"", but, most assuredly, they would NOT be simply ""dead air"". (...and I say, or, in this case, type, all of the above as a Broadcast Engineer with more than FOUR DECADES of experience in these exact subjects!) Heck, even most high-rise buildings and, for that matter, flippin' shopping malls have their own backup power systems, these days, adequate for several days of emergency lighting, heating and plumbing, if not nearly-normal operation.And, while it IS true that the majority of police forces, fire departments and ambulance services would be badly hamstrung by that kind of ""event sequence"" (...sadly, in recent years, FAR too many of our Emergency Services Organizations have been foolish enough to put ALL their communications ""eggs"" into the one overly-delicate ""basket"" of computer-driven and/or VOIP and/or cellphone-tower-based technologies...), it is EQUALLY true that, within minutes of any such disaster, hundreds of surviving Ham Radio operators along the edge of the ""destruction zone"" would be fired-up on their generators or batteries, transmitting graphic, play-by-play descriptions of what their binoculars showed them, while taking over the coordination and dispatching of the aforementioned Emergency Services Organizations, as outlined in various, long-established FEMA protocols.And, apparently, in this fictional universe, the ENTIRE U.S. military, including all ""Lower 48"" State National Guards, is nothing but a bunch of bumbling, incompetent, irrelevant amateurs, who could probably be defeated by a couple of troops of Brownies and Cub Scouts, armed with their magnifying-glass compasses, emergency sewing kits and the occasional, ever-so-deadly Swiss-Army knife... (...gotta watch that plastic toothpick - it's SHARP!)In short (...although, looking back at the length of this rant, it may be a trifle late for THAT...), another high-potential film idea, mostly wasted-off by... what? ...self-indulgent, directorial foolishness...? ...pretentious, ""artistic"" screenwriting...? ...both...? ...neither...? Sure glad this was on Netflix, so, at least there was no separate ""Rental fee"" involved; only cost an hour and fifty-three minutes (...plus the time this review took...).We can only hope this young and inexperienced director either gets a clue, soon, or NEVER gets another directing job until AFTER he's been back to Film School...P.S.: And, how on Earth do you crash a high-end Cadillac hard enough to break enough ribs bad enough to puncture a lung, without a single, solitary airbag going off?!?",How It Ends

You see, if there will ever come an apocalypse threatening the existence of the human race, I actually think that this is what will happen: faced with an unknown deadly threat, a confused and hysterical humanity will be turning against itself instead of coming together, like a wolf in a trap chewing on its own leg; it will be every man for himself, for there aren't enough intelligent, strong and compassionate individuals in the world.

The premise and the cast looks interesting on paper, but what was done with it is sadly lacking, There's no substance and while I got the impression the makers of the film were going for a mysterious and profound feeling, that was far from accomplished.

Some of the quieter scenes, e.g. half way through the film where the protagonists re-discuss ""the boat"", are quite touching.The soundtrack is truly excellent. And I mean truly outstanding.Some hate the start, and end, of the film. But it's not about laziness on the part of the producer / director. It actually does not matter what the disaster is. If anything the lack of clarity there makes sense - if something had such an impact, if the west coast were wiped out, would we really expect facebook to work ? The only question that matters is expressed near the start of the film, to paraphrase if I don't get it totally right ""something happened on the west coast, and the power goes out here, 2000 miles away, and now we have F-22's doing fly-by's ?""In short, nice film, good casting, excellent soundtrack, effective cinematography, worth watching.",How It Ends

The lead character played by Theo Jones was a bit too boring, but maybe he was meant to be to be in contrast to his girlfriend's tough angry dad played by the always intense Forrest Whitaker. Could've easily have done without the Barbie Doll girlfriend, luckily her part was minor. But the movie was very cool, the world goes to crap (well, at least the U.S. does), as the mysterious cataclysm befalls the West Coast... Is it a nuclear explosion? An alien attack? A natural event? They keep you wondering through the whole movie, so you're like, this is great, keep the suspense up, I can't wait till they get to the West Coast and find out! Personally I thought it was something like a natural event from far away in space, like a death x-ray beam from a quasar several hundred light years away, or even massive solar flares... But you never find out, with all the cool special effects that tease you with the possibilities, in the end, there is no end... nothing. Nada. Zilch. Zero. FAIL! Otherwise, it was a pretty good tough, dark, road trip across the Mad Max wasteland... Where once all electricity and communications and GPS and cell service are gone, the country goes to hell and falls into total anarchy. Sounds like fun for sure, but alas, the idiot director decided to take a vacation before the movie was done filming, or maybe he fired his entire writing staff. Either way, there's no point in watching this movie unless you completely understand that the ending is missing. Then you might be able to enjoy it... One of the best characters in the film was the Native American girl mechanic, 'Ricki', she really made the film but they managed cut her out of the movie just when it was getting interesting. I guess i should've known something bad was afoot when they took her out of the scenes, because she was fantastic... an actor by the name of Grace Dove (who just happens to be a First Nations Canadian 'Indian' in real life)... She's about the only good thing that I got out of the film, now I just want to see other films with her in them. But as far as How It Ends? Well, it doesn't...

With an amazing cast and set design this movie had the potential to be one of the biggest films of 2018. Unfortunately, poor writing, awkward tension and forced conversations made this movie seem less-and-less realistic as the storyline progressed. While the actual content of this movie is passable, for those who enjoy the post apocalyptic movies, this movie falls into the same cliché traps that you'd hope it would avoid in this type of movie. With imbedded end-times prophecies and conspiracy-theory government simulations, the movie does an 'ok' job in creating a realistic and fearful atmosphere.

Are you freaking kidding me!!!!,2,25 July 2018,"The movie was suggested to me by the mighty Netflix-suggesting algorithm, and the trailer looked good and Theo James is super hot, so good and hot I thought I'd give it a whirl. I have to admit it took a few to get drawn into it, but I almost turned it off after the appearance of Forest Whitaker's character, the over-bearing father who hates the daughter's boyfriend (fianceé, but daddy doesn't know that yet). James and Whitaker don't like each other but are forced to work together when something mysterious happens back in Seattle (and the west coast in general), the nation's (and maybe world's?) entire power and communications grid goes off line, and it's perceived the daughter is danger, that she survived whatever has happened. James and Whitaker go on a 2000 mile trek from Chicago to Seattle to rescue the daughter, and it's a trek I should have never gone on. They lie to get through a roadblock, and the naive soldier believes the lie, they encounter a blocked off town where the sheriff lets them in just because James gives a few details about a resident, this friend he meets in the town is a very bad actress, and to make it even worse, the whole encounter with her is pointless. At some point, I'm not even sure when, they leave the Interstate, after which they are ambushed by an escape convict in a sheriff's car who has a shotgun or a rifle (how does this even happen??), their car is beat all to crap, Whitaker is hurt, and they're forced to employee a mechanic who agrees to go with them to fix the car if it breaks down (for $2,000 because she wants to go ""out west"" even though they have no freaking idea about what's happened on the west coast). They're once again ambushed by thugs in a car who need gas (they're driving a Prius), then run the Prius off the road to get the gas back, then it blows up. The mechanic goes guilt crazy because she thinks she killed those in the Prius and leaves, and James and Whitaker continue. They encounter more thugs on a bridge, but amazingly once they defeat the thugs and are across the bridge there's no pursuit...hmmmm...made me think a little. Whitaker eventually dies, and James burns the car and continues on foot. Why he burns the car I have no earthly idea.He encounters a family driving on a remote road and they pick him up. Now why would they do this if it's the apocalypse? Wouldn't it really be every man for himself? But they do, and they drive happily until the reach James's father's house in Idaho, which miraculously and without electricity has a functioning doorbell. Now I'm not a rocket scientist, but don't most doorbells today require electricity to work? Also, they have running water, as a matter of fact, everyone in the movie has running water. If the apocalypse is anything like this, at least we'll have running water!James makes a deal with the family for their car and makes it to Seattle. The city is in devastation but not nuclear weapon devastation. In other words the skeletons of skyscrapers are still standing, as are buildings and you can see the well-preserved remnants of Seahawks Stadium. I think the way buildings and most objects, including cars, are still intact and not burnt to a crisp can rule out the use of nuclear weapons.James moves through Seattle wearing a mask he found in an abandoned fire truck, and goes back to his apartment, even as he's climbing the fire escape and can clearly see the building has been destroyed through the broken windows. Is he expecting his apartment to be the only one left unscathed?When he enters the apartment through the destroyed window, the look on his face is ""Really? My apartment is destroyed?"" Also, you can clearly see the floor joists, and as there isn't anything on the floor below to support them it's fairly safe to say the floor would have given way under his weight, but it doesn't. He instead finds the instructions his fiancé wrote for him on the door, as though she knew he was coming back for her. Without communication and power how does she know what happened to the west coast didn't happen elsewhere? Does she have psychic powers?Well, he finds her and psychopath neighbor, whom we've never met before, at a remote cabin in the woods. They talk about a wave, the Sound, and cops telling everyone to flee, yet no explanation is given as to what's happened. Neighbor boy believes everything that has happened has been orchestrated and is in love with the fiancé. He even tries to kill James, but James does the deed first. At the same time neighbor boy is crossing into the next world, a dark cloud of fiery smoke/ash/who knows what appears on the horizon and out of nowhere and James runs to get fiancé and they drive away, the dark plume of smoke chasing them.The end. That's it. There isn't anything else. You are left to confines of your own imagination.But there is one thing I can tell you with absolute certainty: it's not a man-made weapon of mass destruction.Want to waste your time, watch this movie.

This film portrays how quickly civilization could collapse with the onset of an unknown catastrophe. The electric grid and all communications are destroyed, so that no one knows what has happened and the government cannot function. It's never known what caused the disaster, whether an attack by foreign enemies or nature. No one can be trusted because everyone has to look out for their own best interests. There are several encounters with desperate bandits trying to steal cars, gas and food at any cost. It's a little like Mad Max in the present day, but without the charming Aussie accents and crazy vehicles. In the end, we see the couple speeding down a mountain highway barely ahead of another super eruption, and we don't find out if they made it out safely or not. Although it's not a satisfying ending, the point is that even THEY don't know if they will escape, so why should the viewer? Annoying but it makes sense.

First of all, society wouldn't IMMEDIATELY descend into total chaos after a major earthquake/nuclear attack/weather catastrophe/whatever-the-hell (you'll never find out). Also, why is Will so angry at Jeremiah for his theory on what happened? This single scene might be the most strangely and confusingly written/portrayed I've ever seen in a film. Just like the rest of the movie there is ZERO reason or indication as to why this is happening. If something like this did happen and people were left in the dark about what's going on, EVERYONE would have some sort of theory to it. I mean they could've even shown that Will had his own theory that he believed wholeheartedly enough that Jeremiah's theory challenged that belief and caused this rage, but they don't even give you that. Much like every other aspect of the film, the scene is only halfway done.
Some people on here will have you believe that the non-ending (seriously, WTF?) is realistic somehow and therefore brilliant, but a) nothing in this movie is either of those things, and b) even if it were realistic, that doesn't necessarily make for a good film. It's a total let-down. The movie doesn't set itself up as being a realistic movie, therefore going for the ""realistic"" ending is off-putting. The entire movie leads you to believe there will be some payoff to watching through to the end, but then there isn't. It's not smart filmmaking, it's lazy. Don't let the people who want to think they're so smart that they ""get it"" fool you. This is in no way a good movie. It's half-written (and the half that is written is done so poorly).

494,MovieMan2016,Lame Reviews,7,2 February 2019,"I don't usually write reviews, but the quality of the reviews I've read is really, really lacking for the most part.I think the fact that the ending is so open ended is a valid criticism, and I get people coming down on the movie for this reason. Still, this point does not change the fact that for 98% of the film we got a pretty entertaining and intriguing apocalyptic tale. Giving the movie 2/10 or something like that is completely short-sighted and does not accurately reflect its overall quality.The movie could also have delved a little bit into what was actually happening to cause all of the events depicted. A valid criticism. But you know what? It's not what the movie was about. The movie was about two people trying to get to Seattle to save their daughter/girlfriend, two people who were cut off from all but those around them due to the lack of power and cell reception. And one can argue the ending (or lack of one) had artistic merit - the argument that if this was a real event it is how these characters would have experienced it. In such a world, you wouldn't know what is happening, why, and what the outcome will be.Other comments like it wouldn't take 2 days for 90% of the population to go into Mad Max mode are just silly. The film did not depict this at all. Some people did act desperate though, but I think if you give it some thought they had reason to. I think it became clear to many during these events that this wasn't going to be a short power outage, so being a little proactive wasn't exactly a terrible plan.The one pro review I read had the following points:the reviewer could not buy that Ricki would join the main characters, yet gave no explanation for why he felt this. Whatever gave this reviewer the idea that Ricki loved where she lived? She indicated she wanted to move to California, She clearly didn't like her current home and she was going to receive $2K if she went to a place she wanted to go to anyhow (i.e. the west coast). All she needed was to be convinced that Will and Tom were not murderers. Not a huge stretch really.it wouldn't be a road trip movie without stops along the way. Ok. I mean, do you drive from Chicago to Seattle without ever stopping? It's a 30 hour car trip. Sheesh!Will's Dad's house was conveniently empty. I'm not exactly sure why this reviewer thought Will's Dad had to be home. During an event like this, surely people who know each other would band together to plan what they should do. He may therefore have simply gathered with his friends to figure out their next move, or was working with them to actually start doing something. He could have been out looking for someone. He could have been in another town when all this went down. The point is, there are many reasons he may not have been home.For someone who just enjoys watching movies and understands they will play fast and loose with reality at times, I think pro reviews are becoming way too jaded for me to really pay much attention to. There are valid criticisms and then there is just being way too cynical and I notice a lot of the latter.For people who just want to be entertained for a couple of hours (the point of watching a movie, yes?) and not be overly critical and nit-picky about every little thing (especially when it's not warranted), and for those who like this particular sub-genre of movie, How It Ends is pretty solid.",How It Ends

The thing about this one is that it's so frequent that it doesn't even sound like taking the Lord's name in vain; it really just sounds like the screenwriter doesn't have much of a vocabulary and needed filler language. Personally, I tend to feel that dialogue (just like song lyrics) that requires the constant use of of blasphemy or vulgarity--the latter of which is not present in this movie-- stems from a lack of creativity.

It has some decent acting and a few A-list actors in the cast. However, it starts to slow down about half way through. I had almost completely lost interest by the time there were 30 minutes left in the movie. Events happen while the two main characters try to get from point A to point B, but nothing really advances the plot. You do not learn new details about what is going on with the overarching story. I won't go into any spoiler details. However, I can't in good conscience let you watch this movie without explaining one important detail. There is no real ending to this movie. The credits roll and you're left knowing exactly as much as you did when the movie began.

But it's a good ride up until the end.If you don't need closure, it's fun to speculate on what's causing the disasters, which include natural disasters plus disease and irrational paranoia among some of the survivors, all of which happen very quickly.

I liked the characters, the cinematography was great and the story started off quite promising. If you're going to name your film ""How It Ends"" you should probably explain something about how it ends. There's no attempt to explain the disaster other than a weird, forced conspiracy theory (it's a ""simulation"" perpetrated by the U.S. government on the U.S. populace using nukes to create tsunamis and computer viruses to take out the power grid which inexplicably causes everyone to lose any sense of humanity) thrown in by an inconsequential character who seems to be tossed in just to have one more instance of people going completely mental within hours of losing power.
Besides no real explanation for the seminal event, we are to believe that the entire U.S. population will begin to devolve into a Mad Max movie within hours of a national power grid failure. By day 2 or 3, anywhere outside of heavily populated areas (we don't really know what's going on in these areas but we have to assume they're better since the military starts preventing people from leaving within hours of the event) is pretty much every man for himself, kill or be killed. There is no police or military presence in the no-man's-land between population centers and the psychopathic hillbillies have taken over. The final scene depicts the resulting massive wave of destruction caused by what I can only guess is a nearby volcanic eruption (or possibly Death Star super-laser) that is gaining on our protagonists extremely quickly - like hundreds of miles per hour, until it is within stone-throwing distance - at which point the Jeep in which our heroes are escaping is able to outrun it on a gravel road, traveling at maybe 40 miles per hour.

Yes, there were a few far fetched scenes (why was the woman who tricked them into helping her ""flat tire"" yet it was an ambush so angry at our protagonist??) and others, but people can become illogical in frightening situations and yes the writer could've given a better explanation about the cause of the event, but with a little research one could figure it out Luke one reviewer did. EVERYTHING doesn't have to be hand delivered to the audience on a plate. I thought it kept things interesting. Obviously it wasn't nuclear since Will didn't have any side effects from radiation poisoning so that was ruled out along with the fact that the man in his car was still whole and not ash. And YES there was an ending.

Personally, I can totally live with that. Mystery isn't bad, and movies are larger than life, not everything needs explaining.....and other handwaving excuses that readily come to mind. But the problem, as I experienced it, is really that this movie has no idea what it is. 
Is it an action film? Certainly! Cars explode happily, and becoming a capable killer of killers takes only a few days on the road.
Is it a drama? Absolutely! It's like only the miserable people of USA survived ""the event"", and when they're not killing each other, they're crying about it.
Is it an adventure? Clearly! A boy sets out for the princess, but first he must become a man. Many strange things and dangers will he overcome.It has a bit of sci-fi, a tinge of romance (bleak, considering that the protagonists wife is the ""goal"" of the movie), pretty much everything from space opera over vast empty canyons, to minutes of continuous gunfire. And that's just where it goes off the rails for me... I could accept the murderous ways of our protagonists if this was a bloody-dirty action flick, but it just isn't. 
On the other hand, I could maybe have bought Ricki's protests about the violence and subsequent goodbye, if it had any kind of emotional impact on our dudes. But instead it's just a confusing end, to something that suddenly seems pointless (ie Ricki).The greatest surprise is at the end, where the film sort of comes clean. The wife survived! It was all meaningful all along, and all your doubts can be put to rest. Couple minutes screen time later, credits.
Maybe that's what the makers wanted, leaving us with a sense of bewilderment and maybe even feeling a little hurt, that stuff didn't go the way we wanted it to. But still with a warm fuzzy feeling. But not really..?In conclusion, I think drugs were involved.",How It Ends

It starts to decay quickly. The movie is unrealistic, even if an event like whatever the hell happened had taken place. For example, just a day passes after the electricity goes out and there are already bandits in the area? 
Military appear only to block an exit leading west, although they were really far from the west coast, never to be seen again. A military train was derailed without anyone knowing why, everyone dead, but that's about it. 
Pretty strange. And hour goes by, nothing really interesting happens besides more bandits, who where disposed quite quickly and easily and some bad wheather, that could be explained by the weird stuff going on.All this boring stuff would be somewhat worth it if the ending was somehow interesting. Aliens, russians, even zombies would be ok. But no. Nothing! 
The dude arrives at a destroyed steatle, finds a note in the old house where's is bride was saying she was somewhere else, and that's it. 30 seconds. 
Dude goes to the place, she's with another strange guy and if you thought it couldn't get any worse, it does... The next 5 minutes is about alpha males, the dude's jealous, the stranger who saved the wife says his theory about what happened, dude says nah, they go into the forest, dude kills stranger, more bad weather, dude took his wife to run off, some more weird crap, the end.

It was almost like there were 3 directors in this movie: 1st one was decent, had time and money, 2nd has no idea what to do, but keeps the tape going hoping something will come out. 
The last one, is a guy on drugs to whom investors said: ""you have a week to finish this movie, and we'll get you a fix"".

People feel dissatisfied by the film's ending. That's fair, but not a good reason for underrating this wonderful film. I judge a film differently: have I been immersed in a story that I don't want to end? Is it a great escape? Yes it is. So many films in the genre present a story where one has to make dozens of conceits in order to swallow a stupid plot and unreasonable behavior by the protagonists. This film, has a solid plot backed by a strong cast and I thoroughly enjoyed the ride, despite an unresolved ending, which may well have been forced in any event.

If you're looking for science man to explain to Bruce Willis exactly how the end of the world can be stopped so he can put his vest on and save humanity, you're looking at the wrong movie. All the low ratings are clearly by people who just want reruns of standard Hollywood disaster movies.
To my mind, this is exactly how it would appear. No tidy explanations as to what is happening and no heroics. No supermen, just everyday people trying to make sense of a world catastrophe while they struggle to survive. In that way, this is a tribute to story tellers like John Wyndham and HG Wells.
I have my own ideas as to what happened and I think the clues are there, if you look.

607,jundury,"Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing",4,8 August 2018,"I like disaster porn, but eventually it has to include some coherant explanation of the cause, nature, and scope of the disaster. It doesn't have to make sense scientifically, but it has to be consistent within the context of the story. This movie doesn't meet that test. Instead, the screen is littered with clues to a cornucopia of different types of disasters, both natural and man made, and there is never an attempt to explain what actually happened, or even speculate further on the meaning of some of tbe clues. For example, when the leading man gets to Seattle, it clearly looks like there has been a massive volcanic event of some sort, but instead of any discussion of that, we get a scene where there is speculation about the whole thing being a simulation that went wrong. Also, if it was an unprecedentedly large natural disaster on the West Coast, why are people in Chicago instantly panicking and trying to get out of town? And where are the authories? There are trains of military equipment moving west, and then wrecked trains of military equipment, but nary a soldier, dead or alive, in sight. I guess, given the title of the movie, ""How It Ends"", you could give the producers of the movie the artistic benefit of the doubt and say that if something so catastrophic happened that it was going to end civilization in a matter of days, the fog of confusion would be so great that it would be something like this movie.",How It Ends

626,rollora,"Sometimes great atmosphere, decent cgi, ridiculous decisions, boring, predictable survival story...",4,26 July 2018,"... and no endingAfter the ratings werent too high, i expected an atmospheric, yet lacking film with nothing new and some action.What I got was a overused storyline that is presented to you as a whole in the first couple of minutes of the film. Wouldnt matter if the rest of the film was ok. I mean ""safe my daughter/gf from whatever is happening in Seattle, looks like the end of the world"" could actually be exciting. It could be a distopic adventure but they messed it up at many occasions, strange twists, strange decision making of the author/script/director.
I am ok with leaving some things unexplained, but in this movie there are many shots of ""strange"" situations with differend individuals (like a strange hillbilly trying to do something to the mechanic) and clearly the viewers attention should be directed to these persons... only the viewer never gets an answer why his attention was brought onto that person. It kinda feels that they had some Ideas and shot some scenes for some plot-twists but they never included these scenes. But what is still in there are the shots that should give you the hint that later something is going to happen.Also its annoying that they create a very mysterious and dystopic atmosphere (whats wrong? Is the world ending via apocalypse? World war 3? Aliens?... it is unclear) but dont make anything out of it. The only thing they could think of is that all people turn out to be assholes in an apocalyptic event and everyone tries to trick the other. Wow what a great Idea, how original.They completely leave out the idea that the environment, that makes out all the atmosphere in the movie, could be dangerous. Up until... well you guessed it... the end. Then you see a glimpse of something life-threatening. And then the movie ends. Except it doesnt. It is going to the credits without really ending.I rated it 4 out of 10, because besides all the flaws we have an atmospheric movie with obviously some huge cgi budget, some decent acting and some entertainment that works if you switch your brains off. If you want some real dystopic and slowly developing movies that suck you in and leave you with a deep thought, this isnt the one you are looking for.I am puzzled by the title, since ""this is how it ends"" doesnt really end as a movie, and it also doesnt show how the world ends (which it implies), so while the title implies this movie is going to show you a scenario where actually something is ending, you really only see a couple of bad things happen, but nothing really ending.

628,sirrobert,A shallow treatment of the premise.,3,14 July 2018,"First, the positives:1) The actors did a pretty good job.
2) The cinematography was good.
3) The writing was not bad from a technical perspective (but was shallow).
4) The production quality was high.Unfortunately, the movie lacked depth.The single biggest problem with the movie is that it wasn't thought through well. This was clear from several major flaws:1) The entirety of civilization collapsed within 3 days.
2) All human relationships collapsed within a week; the characters were all too shallow.
3) The cause of the disaster was left too unknown.1. It seemed like the writers/director hasn't ever suffered much hardship and couldn't relate to their own story. 3 days was way, way too short of a time for people to turn basically savage. For no reason whatsoever, after two days without power in the midwest, you have ""deranged locals"" pretending to be sheriffs to pull people over and kill them or sieze thier property. Seriously. Two days. By day four small, rural towns in the Dakotas have barricaded their roads and the townfolk are standing guard. A carivan of displaced families with children are shuffling down a state highway like refugees. For some place like New York City where there are enough food supplies for less than a day if the bridges close (yep; go look it up), two days is a tight timeline for that kind of behavior. Out in Wisconsin's farm country or Texas's or South Dakota's? It would take a week for people to run through their pantry items. The entire US military was also apparently completely destroyed by around day 4, but without (apparent) attacks... just the chaos was too much. It just felt weird and forced. Changing the time frame from 6 days to 6 months would have helped a lot (and been relatively easy to do).2. After six days, the mom-to-be has had an affair with her rescuer because they thought the boyfriend was dead. After six days, the rescuer was willing to kill (and die) for that. The father of the mom-to-be died for no apparent reason; he just had a ""feeling"" that his daughter needed him. The wife in the tiny town ""could feel"" her husband had died. In the car at the end, the main couple ""will make it no matter what"" -- presumably on the power of love and feeling strong feelings. The indian girl, about whom they made a point that she's had a really, really tough life, got overwhemed by the fact that she was instrumental in the deaths of the people who ambushed them and left them for dead. Basically, no one had any depth. The father-to-be was a super naieve city boy (sort of) who also couldn't seem to comprehend how fully civilization had collapsed. But he also became a gun expert in a few hours. 3. The ""ending"" was one of those ""implied epilogue"" endings designed to imply ""well... this is the new normal."" Of course, that's the point of the movie. In the title, ""How It Ends"", apparently the antecedent of ""It"" is either ""civilization"" or ""the American way of life."" This was attempted by leaving the precise cause of the whole thing vague. That's fine, of course-- you can do that with a movie, but there are some cinematic rules to follow to pull it off. The biggest one is that you don't have to *buy the right* not to explain the catastrophe. As a director, you're removing the central satisfaction of this kind of genre, so you have to compensate the audience *by enabling them to become conspiracy theorists*. How? Typically there are a couple of ways. (a) You can show them something really, really cool that definitely means *something*, but people are left guessing exactly what it means. Like, a large, cyclopean alien life form looming a thousand feet high. Or A bizzare rift in space bleeding in strange light and a swam of unclear creatures. Or something like that. (b) You can tell what happened, but not tell *why*. For example, you could say that the west coast was definitely nuked, but we aren't sure by whom. Or that five large, unknown objects fell on exactly the five biggest cities on the west coast, devastated them, but no one knows where they came from. Or that the same thing that happened on our west coast happened in every city with more than a million people, worldwide. (c) You can tell what happened, and why, but not what it means for us. Like China and Russia sent tactical nukes followed by an invading force because they think they can take the US, but there's unexpected resistance... who will win? (Think the '80s ""Red Dawn""). The point is, you have to give the audience enough that they can feel confident enough that the ending they create in their minds has sufficient cinematic evidence that it could be Actually True in the movie world.Unfortunately, this movie simply stopped with showing a firey cloud of smoke rolling down from the hills behind the car as it drove to escape the ash. There simply wasn't quite enough for the audience to become conspiracy theorists.",How It Ends

641,deidre-95635,How (Life As You Know) It Ends,7,27 July 2018,"It's a slice of life about a man with his future father-in-law on the road trying to get back to his fiancée in Seattle during ongoing apocalyptic conditions. What happened is besides the point, they are just trying to survive the chaos of the road from Chicago to Seattle. We also wonder the same about why, just like we are there with them. Seems the people giving this a low rating need to be spoon fed a prescribed stock ending. Is it because there were no zombies? Militias are the freaking zombies here. News also travels slow when all communications are down, and there is electromagnetic interference in addition, so no radio is working well enough to perceive an exact cause. Not knowing what happened makes us feel the same sense of shellshocked disbelief as the characters do. Will and Tom have no time to dwell on cause, they have one objective - to get to Sam in Seattle. Well, except for Rikki, but it wasn't her journey anyway, and joining the pair was just a way out of a small, dull life. I think this makes for a fine, well paced, suspenseful action disaster movie that deserves a sequel, or as a pilot for a series. I'd love to know what they encounter up North and maybe finally know if it's just a cataclysmic natural disaster, or if it indeed has a military origin like the jealous neighbor dude suggested near the end. Maybe it's even aliens? 
 
The sequel would have a natural beginning picking it up from the end, North to Canada in an ongoing apocalyptic cataclysm. It's how the world as we know it ends. I'd like to know how it ends up too, but it wasn't even necessary for this movie. People just need to hang on and enjoy the ride!",How It Ends

And my response to that is: Say WHAT?? No, No, Mr. Movie Producer, we pay over 20 bucks to see your stuff and we're tired of getting ripped off because you can't think of an ending!

674,visijared,An atypical disaster film that won't understood by everyone,7,18 July 2018,"Like ""Last Night"", ""How It Ends"" makes good use of the chaos a global disaster event inevitably produces to drive home the point that, in reality, a doomsday survivor has very few choices and virtually no control over their own fate. The only thing you can expect is the unexpected. Not every building you search will have a surprise waiting around the corner. Not every stranger will be unwilling to help. Not every good ol' boy with a gun will try to shoot you. Not every person who flags you down for help is trying to rob you (although that doesn't mean you won't get robbed if you stop to help them). Not every piece of information you'll receive will be accurate. Not every checkpoint is inpassible. Not every trap is inescapable. Not every friend you find will stick around. Not every ally will stay an ally. And not every person you have to kill in order to survive is going to deserve it.Also like ""Last Night"", the writers don't give a fig about the audiences' craving for answers and explanation. The viewer gets precisely as many answers as the characters get... which isn't a whole lot. We only see a few pieces of the puzzle and are left to make our own determinations about the cause of the disaster (which appears to be geological, but we never find out if its natural or man-made). The film could have used the old, tired trope of conveniently bumping into the only eccentric scientist who happens to know exactly what is happening... but that would be unrealistic and this is not that kind of movie. Unfortunately, in our modern age we're so accustomed to having instant information at our fingertips that it is difficult and frustrating to imagine not being able to know within seconds the cause and details of a global disaster, or to accept that we may never get to find out (this is evident once you read the other user comments). In ""How It Ends"", its very possible nobody in the world knows exactly what is happening or why. But again, the 'why' of the situation is simply not what this film is about.The writers are also not gentle on the audience's sense of morality... there are no clear-cut 'bad guys' in the movie, or 'good guys' even, only human beings representing different mixtures of self-interest and ethics. Is it the best apolocalypse movie ever made? Not by a long shot. It is, however, one of the more realistic end-of-the-world films to come out lately, has some decent acting (Forest Whitaker is a national treasure), and is a refreshing take on the American doomsday film genre. At the heart of the story are themes of family, acceptance, generational conflict, loss, and trust. The first act sets up the generational conflict. The second act enforces the title of the film's double meaning, which refers to the end of parental repsonsibility and how difficult it can be for a parent to entrust the safety of their child to that child's chosen partner and new family once they've become adults. This is visually represented as a slow gradual shift from driver to back-seat driver. The third act represents the challenges a new starter family encounters when the previous generation is no longer able to provide support, and their children have to assume the full mantle of adulthood on their own terms.As for the ending, I found it fitting and appropriate. I'm not sure what others were expecting but I was satisifed with the characters' natural progression. Having recently lost my parents and started my own family without much outside help, I understand the film's final message and can relate to how the characters feel in the last scene. What they saw in the rear-view mirror and what they said to each other is exactly how it feels to have your youth finally come to an end and assume the burden of parenthood.Watch this movie. And if you haven't seen Last Night (1998), watch that one too.",How It Ends
675,Chien_Noir,A beautifully photographed nothingburger,3,16 July 2018,"As a fan of dystopian fiction, I had high hopes for this movie. It failed to deliver.The premise: The power grid goes down instantly across the United States due to a ""seismic event"" on the west coast, and society collapses equally instantly. A guy and his future father-in-law mend their differences while traveling to rescue the guy's pregnant girlfriend. Within two days, the travelers are accosted by raggedly desperate suburban looters, threatened by cops blocking roads, involved in many fiery car crashes, and shot at by folks apparently driven mad by sudden lack of cell phone contact. Unfortunately, there is not much more to the story. We never find out what happened, beyond vague hints. We never learn the connection between the ""seismic event"" (at the end of the film, it appears to be some form of massive volcanic eruption) and total loss of the power grid.  It's difficult to comment on the acting, because the actors were given very little to work with. The only character with any depth is Ricki, a quirky Native American girl played by Grace Dove. Her character disappears halfway through, taking with it the only real breath of fresh air.Overall, the film contains stunning landscape shots and excellent special effects, but the story lacks any depth or cohesion. It doesn't conclude so much as stop -- with the protagonist and his girlfriend easily outrunning some sort of pyroclastic flow and driving off into a pointless, unexplained post-apocalyptic sunset.How does it end?

I gotta say, the bad reviews actually made me want to watch this film as most people are complete brainless idiots these days. I thought this was incredibly well done. Life is normal then bam, sudden chaos! 
Do people really think that when the proverbial crap hits the fan in real life that you're always going to know exactly what the heck is going on? It left a few open ideas with us at the end and you can take what you want. Maybe being a little confused is good for your brain eh? I bet you'll be a little confused if you're alive to see the end of life as we know it! I loved that the girl took off, the fake cop was a cool idea also and Whitaker dying when he did was genius and didn't need to be spread out any longer. The crazies all around trying to steal and get ahead is almost assuredly how it will be (better keep at least one of your guns snowflakes) when something like this goes down. Then you had the actual nice family that trusted him and he likewise. They had everything to lose and the hope of something to gain. Both parties had a gun so of course there was peace and respect between the family and the dude.The ending in my opinion was damn good! A movie does have to end right? You really don't need to know how everything played out after that. Use your imagination maybe? Here is the ending... destruction and a new world and did they live or die? I don't know and at that very moment they didn't know if they would either. But you can bet your ass they were going to do everything they could to survive just like anybody else.",How It Ends

So the discrepancies in locations threw me off. First they're at the Crow Reservation, then they backtrack to Ashland, they're talking about the pass (which is in Montana), then they're seen passing a Welcome to Montana sign despite the fact they've been in Montana for a day or two now. The jeep has California plates but if they were coming from LA I'm guessing they tried to get away from the coast which means they'd have gone the Nevada-Salt Lake City-Butte route, which would have then going straight north to Canada, not west to Coeur d'Alene, and they certainly wouldn't have run into Will right before the Welcome to Idaho sign (which was not the pass I've been over so many times). I know they're trying to avoid the freeway (which would explain why they weren't on the Idaho/Montana pass) but that would be an awful lot of looping around to have their locations all scattered out like that. Besides they're back on the freeway later before they get to Coeur d'Alene because they see an exit sign for it.Otherwise I liked the movie. I really did.

687,nomadspirit,Dull as all hell,2,30 July 2018,"Nothing about this film is any good really. The concept is fine; man and father of his pregnant girlfriend trek across America during some unspecified apocalyptic events to find said girlfriend. The execution, for the most part, is acceptable. Its shot well, with some really nice visual effects to convey the world-ending things going on. The acting is even decent for the most part, however much Forest Whittaker is phoning it in. It's in the writing and the pacing where it all falls apart. Some of the dialogue is achingly bad, like it's been written by a film school student. Lines that don't need to be there, entire scenes that feel shoved in to pad out the runtime. The script could've been halved, the number of encounters and events significantly reduced and it would've made all the difference. Characters are introduced, get way more lines than their development should allow, then fall by the wayside. We either don't know them well enough or like them enough to care. By the fifth time the group encounter some crew of random nutjobs, you're hoping they all get gunned down so the movie can finally end.There are also laugh out loud moments where the film switches genres. Look out for a scene on a bridge, wherr derpy lead Will manages a full speed J-turn, a perfect 180 spin and even a drift (to allow Forrest Whittakers character to shoot out of the window, Matrix-style) without any prior practise. It's stupid and feels totally out of place. What could've been a watchable apocalypse flick instead ended up being an overlong, bloated, afternoon nap of a film. Considering this the third recent Netflix movie to be a train wreck I'm surprised they're still getting commissioned. Maybe I should write a screenplay and get paid for it.

This is the first review I've ever written because I just had to say something about this movie.
To start with this movie had a lot going for it.
The trailer had me so excited and the movie looked like a fun and thrilling action disaster movie.
I watched it straight away and I even got on board with the cliche 'needing fathers approval' storyline.
When the ""disaster"" happened, I got quite excited and I was very intrigued to find out what was going on.
I won't get into the details of the story after that but for the most part I was enjoying it.
It was nothing spectacular by any means but I was having fun watching it and was so excited to find out what was happening.
Government? Storms? Fires? Earthquakes? Blackouts? Volcanoes?
What was the cause?
As the movie went on, it started getting a little repetitive.
We get it, you need gas every five minutes!!
Even after the girl vanished (seriously where did she go?) and after the father died (WHY did he burn the car?) I was still on board to get to the ending.
WHAT WAS UP WITH THE NEIGHBOUR?!?!
Why was he so dodgy and why was Will SO against his theory as to what was happening?
And then we having the ending, the question to ""How It Ends"" is simple...it doesn't.
I didn't need them to live happily ever after, I was ok with them still needing to survive longer but could we at least get some kind of hint that they were going to get further than down the road before running out gas again????
I was even ok with not finding out exactly what had caused everything, but I at least would have liked a legitimate clue so that I could make up my own theory.
The closest ""theory"" we got was the dodgy neighbours.
This movie started strongly, dipped in the middle, got me excited towards the end and has now totally ruined my week!!
I suggest you watch the first 3/4 of the film and then stop because you'll only be disappointed!AND WHAT WAS UP WITH THAT FAKE COP BEING SO OBSESSED IN CATCHING THEM?
AND THAT CHICK IN THE FIRE WITH THE DEAD HUSBAND WHO STARTED YELLING AT THE MAIN CHARACTERS...WHY?
WHAT DERAILED THE MILITARY TRAIN?
WHERE DID THE GIRL GO?
WHERE DID WILL'S FATHER AND FAMILY GO?
WHAT HAPPENED????????????????????",How It Ends

The second is the ending is all over the place and makes no sense.

And I was not dissapointed - considering the reviews. Yes there were some plot holes. Fx we never get a slight explanation about why and whatever happened or how. But what I found interesting is how this movie portrays how soon people become animals if we lose our basic needs like electricity and gas and how it becomes every man/women for him/her self. Something thats seldom portrayed in movies but often in gaming.The ending i found interesting because the camerawork can make you interpret it two ways. Not gonna go into details here. But you don't get your typical hollywood ending.
It would also be interesting to see this become a 10 episode series.

The character development between Will and Tom, if a little generic, is fine.The bad:For a movie about driving 2000 miles across country, there is very little character development. Ricki comes and goes from the movie and we know almost nothing about her, despite her presumably having been in the car for days.The characters have a painful lack of curiosity, so while there seem to be plenty of opportunities to start figuring out what's going on, they never take them. For example, during the scene with the crashed train, Will checks it out to see if there's any gas, but doesn't even take a moment to see why the train crashed.Human behavior after the first bit seems unreasonable. No one is talking about what they know, despite plenty of people having first-hand is experience with some sort of incident, and everyone seems unreasonably hostile. It just doesn't seem consistent with how we know people behave during disasters.The conflict between Jeremiah and Will makes absolutely no sense.

The acting is poor at its highest level and the story line is virtually non-existent. The little adventures on the way are stupid and poorly thought out and make almost no sense whatsoever.

For a guy who never even fired a weapon, he sure had no problem killing people in the end after only a 5 day road trip...?
Then he ""hears"" something and they decide to take off with the jeep driving like crazy while knowing nothing, most people would try to figure out what it is and from where it's coming befor running for your life but must be some spider senses or something.
They race down the road with a dust storm, or something, behind them and the movie ends, wtf.We watch movies to see what the writers intended and not make up our own ending.
Rotating compas? did the planet's core stopped? but that would have killed off the entire planet, not just a small part of the coast
Citiy in ruins? meteor strike? sure wasn't a vulcano as there was no vulcano, lava or gigantic ash cloud.
Solar flare? Good luck trying to explain that one with the above reason for it being a local disaster.
Aliens! Nope, no space ships. Damnit!I'll give it a 6 as even with all the flaws they actually tried and I was actually entertained for once :)
Forest Whitaker carries the movie, got to work with what you were given and as the only character I could actually care about, 3 stars for a great job with limited materials.
Rest of the cast, meh, wished Tom was the one reaching the end instead of the usual bs as a twist and keep it going.
Story wise they did ok on a very thin plot, the character building worked for the most part though some cutting would have been nice as I did skip some dialogs as it felt too dragged out.
Story, camera work, effects and overall set designs and mood of the movie I would sum that up as the other 3.All in all it is an ok movie, but if they would have found a bit more money to actually include an ending with the entire planet going to hell, and a plausable reason why it started local to go global (still don't see how that is possible), not have done that rushed ending from where he found his wifey and end the movie, I might actually given this an 8.

785,markolos,Everything in this movie looks rushed and generic,2,21 July 2018,"Ok, where do I start. Contrary to the most of the reviews, I don't mind the ending (or better said the lack of it) that much. There are some great movies with open endings that really make you think, like Memento for example. I love that in a movie. But, the problem with this movie is that everything is so rushed and generic, that you won't actually care enough about anything or anyone to make you think. The only thing you'll think at the end of the movie is ""why did I just waste 2 hours on this?""The character development is almost non-existent. I mean, really, we don't get to learn anything about any character in this movie, even the main ones. All we do get to learn about them is that one of them is an ex military and the other one is a lawyer or something, the lawyer guy is soon to be ex military guy's son in law and the ex military guy one doesn't like the other guy too much because he crashed his boat (or he thought so, but it turns out his daughter did it while she was drunk and she knows nothing about it, only Will who was also drunk). We also learn they both had lousy fathers and that's about it. Have you fallen asleep yet? I almost did while writing this.Not only that there are little to no details, but they are highly irrelevant as well. None of them has any distinguishable characteristics, nor strengths or weaknesses. Just two generic guys who may as well both work at the McDonald's and have super dedicated fathers and it wouldn't change anything in their behavior nor do anything for the plot. We don't even get to learn anything about ex military's daughter and soon to be Will's wife. Seriously, she's like center figure of this movie (they both go to save her) and yet, she's just a generic pregnant woman and the only thing we know about her is that her name is Sam, that she probably loves Will and the she likes to drive boats under the influence of alcohol. The only other character we get to know anything about is Ricki, a female mechanic they picked up on the way and who had (and obviously still has) a tough life, which is also highly irrelevant for the story, especially as she soon suddenly disappears and they didn't even mention her the rest of the movie. The other characters are there just to fill the spot I guess. They don't add anything to the story, we don't learn anything about them and therefore, you won't even care what happened to them.Next, if you think there are disasters that are happening and that will keep you at the edge of your seat. No luck there either. Every disaster is fished with an anti-climax or is represented with a few rumbles. For example, on their way they run into some kind of a super storm like they've never seen before. And what happens? Nothing. And I mean literally nothing. The super storm is represented with some heavy rain (I actually drove through worst one just a few days ago), 3 seconds later they park the car under the bridge and continue traveling in the morning like nothing happened. I kid you not, the worst storm ever did nothing to the car nor the environment. Even the road remained dry.Now, let's talk a bit about people they run into (I don't call them characters on purpose because they don't have any names nor we see any of their faces). They all look and behave like they are in Mad Max movie or something. That kind of society takes years to form. This is just 2-3 days after the disaster. Yes, I can understand that some people would start to panic, behave irrationally, break into stores and steal stuff, but having highly organized armed men with equipped vehicles and bikes waiting for random people on the bridge and attacking them for no obvious reason. Come on.At the end, I would like to mention just a few stupid actions and reactions in this movie which irritated the hell out of me and made the whole experience of watching it even worse. First, there is a scene where some tugs attack Will for no obvious reason (just like everything else happens in this movie) at gas station. Tom (ex military guy) pulls out the gun and chases them away. Now, Will is so mad and offended, that he yells at Tom about how he could not tell him about the gun or something among those lines. Are you f*ing kidding me? There are 300 million guns registered in the US and you're surprised that highly trained ex marine, who is heading with you into the danger zone full of unknowns mind you, is carryng one????? Reallllllly? That's what bothers you and not the fact that some guys almost put a hole in your head for no reason and he saved your ass and who knows what else you'll encounter on the way?While we're at it, why would ex military guy only take 1 gun with only like 7-8 bullets. Doesn't he have any other weapons and more ammunition, anything?. Ok, let's say it's plausible and he didn't see the need to keep more of that in his home, so that's all he had. But, when they run into crashed military convoy, why did they only took gas? Wouldn't they take some more weapons, medicine, some armored vehicle or anything that would help them on the way? Especially as at that time they knew that roads are not safe and that there are many maniacs over there.Also, doesn't ex military guy have any friends who are still in the active service or know someone in the active service he could ask about what's going on just so he can have at least some info about what awaits him on the way? Or ask for some help? No, he just grabs his stuff and goes on the road, with no strategy of any kind. That's not ex military, it looks more ex McDonald's with bad attitude to me.And what about Will's reaction when software guy mentioned that it's not natural disaster but rather a man induced one or something among those lines. Why he got so upset? It makes no sense. He should be happy because he found his pregnant wife and that his baby is ok and think about what next. But no, he would be rather bitching about someone's opinion on how disasters started even if he doesn't know what's going on either. Not to mentioned that the entire thing with neighbor and his wife was unnecessary and has no point.All in all, easily forgettable movie. If I knew what it's like I would watch paint dry for 2 hours rather than this piece of bad writing.2/10 only because of Forrest Whitaker because I give movies he's in 1 rating higher than the movie actually deserves.",How It Ends

Unlike most of the others here (tho the movie reviews were sorted according to their helpfulness, so maybe I saw all similar reviews after similar reviews), I think the movie actually has an ending. It is even made too obvious.So since this is not a spoiler free review, I'm going to spill the beans right away. It was all a simulation, probably some of the characters being NPCs or maybe all of them were or maybe only the main character who is trying to deliver his damsel in distress is a real person in a simulation full of NPCs. So how do the writers and director impose that? What are the hints?-Third persons in the movie are too shallow, we don't even get to know their names (the guy who has a wife and a baby who let Theo James in his truck) or they are generally too easy to persuade (think of Forest Whittaker getting past the soldiers by talking his way out) and some of the time we don't even see their faces properly which seemed like a deliberate move to me.
The weird chat between Theo James and his wife's neighbor. First it was implied that it is a simulation which shouldn't normally cause any tensions out of nowhere. It is so out of place that you either their it is bad script or a deliberate move to pull the audience into the simulation theory. -Finally, the final scene where a big fire and smoke, out of nowhere chases the truck as they try to get away but eventually those disperse into an almost deliberate low quality 3D smoke and seemingly they make it out of the impossible disaster.So why am I rating the movie 4/10. Because unlike almost all other reviews I've read here, I think the movie made it too obvious that this is a simulation even by using the word 'simulation'. The neighbor in the last 10 mins of the movie was actually way too forthcoming about it. It could have been injected more slowly to the viewer.",How It Ends

Really after less than 24 hours of no power and internet, there's people driving around in stolen police cars robbing anyone they pull over!Also, what's with the water park!? 4 days after the power and internet failure, and the place is a rusted ruin, with abandoned cars littering the place! Where did the owners of those cars go?The whole film is random, a story written with the sole pretence, that if a country loses power and internet for a week it falls apart.And finally the massive plot and continuity holes, for example, GSP would not stop working (although it would be hugely inaccurate after a few days), it certainly wouldn't just blank out on the in car system! Why were the pumps on the gas station working? Surely they require power (a backup generator seems such a stretch). 3 days in and one town has set up its own army! There are too many to list... Oh and it doesn't have an ending (if you make it that far!), it has credits after another plot hole scene (a volcano of that size would produce debris hitting close to the speed of sound, they'd never out run it!). It would have been much cooler to have them die, then have 5 minuets of other mummified corpses, indicating that this was a global extinction event, humanity was dead and this was the story of two of the casualties!",How It Ends

He leaves Seattle and goes to Chicago for a business meeting and to advise her father (Forest Whitaker), a sullen retired military man of some wealth, that he intends to marry her. Things don't go well, and you could excuse the young suitor for getting all full of profanity during the encounter, but he gets profane quite a bit throughout. So profane, in fact, that you as a loving parent really don't want your kids anywhere near this film. The F word is repeated five times in a row in one line of dialogue. Anyway, the young lover and father-to-be calls his girlfriend to say hello and to describe his encounter with her dad just as the West Coast blows up. Earthquake? Tsunami? Volcanoes? Civil unrest? A government conspiracy? The young father and his future father-in-law drive a big Cadillac to Seattle to be with the mom-to-be. Cinematography is a mix of picturesque vistas and yellow ash-heavy skies. Heavier yet is the dialogue, where the two actors engage in discussions which ultimately construct a rickety totally extraneous backstory. Yes, his dad left, he still sees him, yes, the young man admits, he took the blame for sinking Whitaker's family yacht, but she really did it. Oh, good god. Then there's a young woman from a reservation who goes along as a mechanic for the battered Caddy, but she wisely bales out with about an hour left in the film.

All the other reviews have covered the lack of substance to the movie and, more importantly, the lack of any conclusion, and some have defended this as being a reflection of reality where we don't always know the answers. But this defence ignores the movie's other glaring problems and numerous plot-holes.Where is everyone? There are 330 *million* people in the US, but the two main characters meet, what, a couple of dozen in total, driving from Chicago to Seattle? The roads should have been far busier, people driving west to east and east to west looking for friends, etc. We see the Sgt. at the first checkpoint let them through just because Forest Whitaker *says* he used to serve, without any proof or real argument, so it seems a lot more people would have got through that checkpoint, and a ton more through back roads. What was the point of the Ricki character? She added nothing to the story, then just walks out after 20 minutes of screen time travelling with them. Theo James (Will) is a lawyer, right? So presumably we've skipped the backstory that he used to be a professional stunt-driver because that's the only way he could have carried out those perfect 180s and drifts on the bridge in an unfamiliar, unsuitable, car. There's a crashed military supply train (why did it crash? where are the recovery units?) and all he gets from it is two cans of fuel (which luckily is gas, not diesel, which the Humvees on board would use)? What, no weapons, no more fuel, water, food? Why does Will continue driving that crappy 4x4 he got off the family when he's driving past countless newer more powerful models? So the next door neighbour helped Will's girlfriend escape from Seattle, but they took no-one else with them? They didn't meet a single person on their journey that they felt they should allow to join them or a group they could have hooked up with? OK, the neighbour is clearly an ass, there should be *hundreds of thousands* of people fleeing the west coast, possibly millions, even with that level of destruction.

About the ending, I don't think there needs to be an explanation at all. The story could be a metaphor about how a man struggles in life, relationship, and family. He flew to his wife's dinner and felt disconnected with her family. The Facetime call she made with him the next morning showed that she actually also sided with her family: ""my mom kicked you out"" etc. That's when he felt disconnected with her as well. The apocalypse starts: she said 'something's wrong'. He and her father were on the road trying to figure out what happened with Sam: to both of them, she's drifting apart (moved to Seattle) -- the apocalypse. Will found about the Jemi: a man who has a bond with his wife and tries to to kill him. Jemi may imply a problem, an issue in life that his wife is enduring that he just found out. He killed Jemi without hesitate: to protect his own life and to eliminate the lingering problem following his wife even everything collapsing around them. He learned to act fast and bold through the tough road trip with his in-law. The ending, his wife is confused but trusts Will to run away with him from the cloud. They are heading somewhere else, maybe the North, maybe home. But Will surely figure out about Jemi, killed him, and run away with Sam toward new path. Family sticks together. When 'something's wrong' to one, the rest look in each other eyes: ""i'm coming for him/her no matter it is an apocalypse, are you coming with me?""I rated 8 because there should be more colours in the movie and side stories.

897,inutilsuverzivo,unfair reviews. Just don't have overexpectations.,5,23 July 2018,"First of all, yes the ending sucks. but the problem with this movie is not the movie itself, its the overexpectations. most people was expecting either a disaster movie like 2012 or the day after tomorrow; or a invasión movie like battle of los angeles, or a post apocalyptic movie like mad max. i don't blame them, since the first minutes are consistent into that direction.i started watching HIE by random pick like usual Netflix without knowing even what was the genre of the movie so i wasnt expecting anything. and once digested the cr*p of the end i thought about what i was feeling and it wasn't anger or even remorse for the time invested. It is not Kubrick stuff but neither it is a bad movie.no spoilers, but, whatever ending you are thinking this is going into, it doesnt matter, because the story is about the travel and not the goal. if you saw Monsters that's what im talking about. you dont have any clue of what is happening because that's not relevant to the story they want to tell. Once you accept it and accept that a giant nuclear reptile with laserball eyes emerging to defend the US against an alien invasion is just not going to happen, you can recognize that the movie has its merits.First. the lack of cliches. every scene you think you know whats going to happen because you have already seen it before, you are wrong. Just one example. if it was Denzel W instead of FW, you know he'd shoot everyone and clear the way until Seattle like a pro, everyone's happy, end of story. well, about that...Second. the thrill. they don´t give you almost any clue about what's happening, and yet, if you are here complaining about the end its because they managed to keep you on your seat through the whole 'boring' storyThird. the characters are, if not sympathetic, at least not as annoying as in any other Netflix production. One reason should be enough to rate the movie higher than 1 and i just gave you three. Just don't have overexpectations.",How It Ends
898,edithbretado,How does no one get the ending?!,9,15 July 2018,"I read a lot of reviews of people getting mad about the ending and asking where the ending went...how does no one get it?! People are very rude in reviewing this movie because they aren't deep thinkers in my opinion and because they like movies where the end gives a concrete definite death or life type of ending. For those of you who don't get the ending here it is: The title is called 'How It Ends' so in the end when you see Will and Samantha driving away from the rolling volcanic wave you can clearly see that by the speed of this volcanic wave they are NOT going to make it out alive, hence the title HOW IT ENDS. That is how it ends, they don't survive! I think they chose not to show them getting killed by the horrific volcanic wave for obvious reasons...not many like to see a sad ending in this horrific way AND because Samantha was pregnant, who wants to see a mother to be die via being burned alive? I would think no one. Plus this was not that kind of movie. Also, if you guys paid attention to what Will tells Samantha- ""Let's go, it's happening again"" or something along those lines, you should have processed that the entire sequence of the world ending was happening all over again to wipe out the entire human race or anything/anyone still alive until everyone is dead. So those catastrophic events would keep happening over and over and over again until earth is no more. Again, hence the title HOW IT ENDS. Referring to how the death of Will and Samantha ended and how the death of the planet ended. Get it now everyone? This is what I got from it if you connect the name of the title to the events and saying from Will. I think it was very well made and the acting was on point by every actor/actress in the movie.

915,evanroggenkamp,Underrated depiction of massive apocalyptic events,8,18 November 2018,"This movie doesn't deserve all the hate in my opinion. I think it was a very realistic look into what could very well happen in a major disaster type situation like this. The timeline to lawlessness and chaos is a bit acellerated, but given the fact that Seattle was destroyed in 5 days, and all power and communication was knocked out, it makes sense. If anything it should open your eyes to the reality of how fragile the infrastructure we depend on is. Most people don't follow FEMA recommendations for emergency preparedness, and this film does a good job at showing how quickly survival would become a very real battle for many people. There are some obvious nonsensical things like the driver being able to pull multiple j turns on a very narrow bridge at high speed while being pursued, but I can overlook that because it's Hollywood and it's supposed to be entertaining. As for the ending and lack of reveal as to what the event truly was, I appreciated that and felt the film gave more than enough evidence for us to draw reasonable conclusions as to what it is. The magnetism changes, power outages, birds, ash, and seismic events really only point to a handful of things. Pole shift, supervolcanic activity, a coordinated attack as suggested in the film, or gama rather burst near our solar system. To me it really doesn't matter a whole lot. That's not what the film was about. It was about the reality of the quickness of deterioration of society and the reality of survival everything from being willing to kill for gas or being unable to communicate with loved ones thousands of miles away, things we take for granted altogether too often.",How It Ends

923,tpmilloy,Why audiences turned against this movie.,6,19 August 2018,"I am really surprised at all the hate and negative response from this movie but I believe I know why. I watched it with a group of friends and I was stunned by how upset people got. This was a unique take on a familiar scenario, brilliantly directed, amazing restraint and incredible performances. But one bold decision in story telling, essentially was like the doctor amputating the wrong leg.Even though this story was set up as a father and soon to be son-in-law hitting the road to find the daughter/fiancee after a mysterious event that might bring the end of the world... we quickly realize that's not what this movie is about. This is a story of two men who must find friendship and mutual respect while the fate of humanity hangs in the balance. And this story is beautifully done, quickly becoming the main thrust of the movie, while the impending apocalypse slowly becomes nothing more than a unique and interesting backdrop and landscape.The problem is this movie amputates the best part of itself and loses it's ability to attempt an ambiguous ending. I'm a fan of ambiguous story elements and I believe it takes a bold filmmaker to attempt it but I believe there is one rule that allows this to work and that is the story that does resolve needs to be more important and carry more weight than the unresolved one. When the father dies at the end of the second act and the movie returns to the original premise, this only backfires for any attempt at an ambiguous ending. If the story would have stayed with the ""father and son"" story, I believe the movie would have worked. If he wouldn't have found his fiancee until the very final moments, the movie would have worked. But the problem is our hero achieves everything he set out to do, (befriend his father-in-law and finds his fiancee) with too much time left on the screen, and now the only question left is the mysterious event. Three questions or problems were posed to our hero in the beginning, what caused the event, will I find my fiancee and will I survive if I go on this journey with my estranged father-in-law. Problem is two of them are answered and the only question left is the event for the third act. Essentially we are positioned for the final answer, but not given it. If the father story or the fiancee story was the final resolve, then I believe it would have worked. I mean let's face it, does it matter what causes the end of the world? Whether it be aliens or a terrorist attack, a virus outbreak, we've seen it all before so who cares? And this movie had all the tools to end it without telling us, but one mis-step forced us into a place where we needed to know. It's a shame such a brilliant piece of movie making is over looked because of the final two minutes.",How It Ends

925,bamzmad-00287,What is IT that ends here,8,25 April 2019,"If you expect the story is about how the world technically ends, then it's not a movie for you.Instead, the filmmakers focus on postmodern inter human's relationships that are based on pretentiousness, biases and subjective interpretations. THAT is what ends. So the impacts of the catastrophic events are more mental than material.Unlike the other world's end movies, HIE has no epic scenes of volcanoes erupting nor atomic bombs exploding (it's not even explained what's actually going on). So some may find it rather boring.The ""slow pace"" is intentional to let the relationship of two main characters evolve. The only thing remains is the connection between Will and Sam; it is shown in the beginning and the ending of the movie. The moral of this story is that the only thing remains at the world's end is our true connection to people we really care for. All the connection gap we create for the others we don't care about will eventually end, because it doesn't matter.",How It Ends

927,ran_ayana,I've never written a review but this time i should,5,31 August 2018,"SPOILER ALERT!!Watched this on netflix right before bedtime and i can't sleep because i just can't keep my thoughts of the movie, especially thanks to the no ending story.The movie started off great but there are some things appear weird for me:
1. I kinda hate Will's character.
If you notice, it's him who causes many troubles since the beginning. He couldn't even deal with some punks who tried to steal Tom's car. He didn't listen when Tom said to get in a car when the police approached them, in the end it caused Tom a great injury. He caused an accident on the road and causing people dies, it's him who tried to save a woman in the middle of fire only to see that it's a trap.And is it only me who notices how his driving skill improved so much when he and Tom were facing an incident on the bridge?2. Okay, Tom and Will have a good luck for being allowed to enter the gate where everybody else are not.3. The most pointless plot ever: Ricki left in the middle of nowhere. When I saw this I was like if Ricki left it would be a total waste of story. And it really happened. What is the point of bringing her into the movie at all? Ricki's acting was okay to me, only the story was not.4. So when Will arrived at Adam's house and meet his wife, why don't Will find something to cure Tom's broken rib? For a person who can find anything even at the abandoned place, this one is pretty weird. In fact for Tom's broken rib, everyone else was pretty calm about it i almost believe that broken rib is not a serious injury until i saw the end.5. When Will finally meet Sam, I thought Sam and the neighbour guy had something and i realized when Sam said to the neighbour pointing gun at Will, ""It's okay it's our neighbour."" It is OUR neighbour, do you sense something? (Or do you think Sam said this to Will instead?)When Sam and Will were on the bed and Will said ""i will never leave you again."" Did you see Sam's staring eyes at Will? I believe she starred that way for a reason. It's like she hide something that she unabled to say.Also, when the neighbour guy took Will into the forest to chase 2 children, neighbour said about his relationship with Sam, ""we have something too. We thought you were dead.""This proofs the theory that Sam and him had an affair. And ""we thought you were dead?"" I thought it's only less than 7 days since Will left Sam to Chicago?? Isn't it too early to replace the fiancee you thought were dead?6. The most disappointing one is the ending. You know how it feels like when you queueing for a ticket to a limited edition show with a happy heart and right when it's your turn to arrive at the locket, the ticket was sold. Yeah i felt that by the end of the movie. I held my breath and ready to release it when I really see the ending. Only, there was no ending...And i am not sure if there will be how it ends 2. I mean i wanna know what happens next but it's kinda like ""that's it"".So that's all.

The ambitiousness of the film, I love that we don't ever really find out what is happening, made me research the whole Polar Axis flip phenomenon, pretty interesting stuff
The visuals were stunningThe bad:
The USA devolves into a bunch of tattooed tank top wearing hillbilly mercenaries, what, hours after the ""event""? Yeah, not happening. 
The whole conflict at the end between the neighbor who saved lawyer dude's wife was just cringe-worthy, like what the hell
Lawyer dude becomes Mad Max/John Wick like a day after pickup up a handgun
Ricki, what was the point at all with this character, then just write her out
The pit stop at his friend's wife's house just wasted time and yet again more hillbilly mercenaries

960,davidhands,Thought required.,6,15 July 2018,"If you watch this film with the expectation of a well ordered context and a clearly explained at the beginning of the film setting and a happy ever after ending then you're going to be disappointed.
Watch the film as though you were in the character's shoes - something has happened, it happened somewhere else but was of sufficient magnitude to affect everything. Authority appears to have collapsed, there are no comforting messages on radios telling you what to do, the power's out. Highways you would expect to be clogged with traffic stand empty. No one you meet knows what's happened or have vague fragments of rumours. 
This film is, loosely, like a kind of 'Cloverfield, the Road Movie', (Bokeh has a similar theme) - 'most people have disappeared, no explanation is offered, the characters react'. It's not too bad a film, there are a lot of 'made for TV' disaster movies that are dreadful but this film isn't one of them. The relationship between the two characters develops obviously and there are few twists. The end sequence seems to indicate that the ""big event"" was, at least in part, volcanic in nature.

A bit reparative in the plot, ie search for resources, get assaulted, search again, get assaulted again etc. Still, have to admit a nice realistic element as you would really have to be foraging constantly in case like this. Many reviews complain about the lack of a clear conclusion, but I understood the thought process. We of course want to know definitively what caused the disaster and what happens now, but I feel the writer and director didn't include this because it would have gone against the sense of realistic confusion they had built throughout the movie. The whole premise was that the disaster was so immediate and wide spread and sudden that nobody knew what exactly happened. Just because you find your loved one at moutain side home, it's unlikely they'll know a lot more than you given the circumstances. You're constantly trying piece together what happened from clues in the various scenes, but you're basically always left wondering nuclear vs natural earthquake scenario. 
The trials faced as they crossed the country were generally extremely dangerous and realistic, although some of the organization displayed by certain groups seemed a bit extreme since they were only a couple days into the event. The biggest scene I took issue with was when Will burned the body of Samantha's father along with the car. Didn't seem necessary or practical in that situation.

975,rmezatang,it ends before it begins,2,15 July 2018,"The second I saw Forest Whitaker, I knew I was wasting my time, but I was amazingly bored and generously gave him the benefit of the doubt. Lets address this on a few points.
If you can identify no more then one actor in a movie, it's probably going nowhere fast.
If that one actor is scarcely memorable for any performances, it's going there really fast.
An apocalyptic event that no one can identify, but later seems surprisingly like volcanic activity ? I think a volcanic eruption could be identified.
ALL communication wiped out ?, yet somehow ham radios are still working ?
I think the emergency broadcast system is designed to be better then ham radios. 
What could wipe out every satellite in orbit and the entire power grid ? EMP ? No, cars and generators and trains and planes still seem to work fine.
An army train transporting shiny new equipment without a single soldier in sight ?
Lets move onto characters.
Ricki is introduced as a supporting character, you are almost made to feel something for her, then they literally just dump her from the movie mid-way through? 
City lawyer can suddenly drive a car like a racing driver, shoot well for someone who has NEVER held a gun, yet when confronted with the end of the world, and a gravy train of fresh army goods to scavenge from freely, he picks up two cans of gas ? NO military grade weapons, ammo, armored vehicles that are likely being transported ready to drive ? What a monumental idiot. Even worse then the guys that run around in movies killing everyone with nothing more then a pistol, and passing up every single automatic weapon and ammo supply littering the ground with each new corpse the drop.
The girl makes it out of a city apparently decimated by some disaster, but thankfully, she left the only clue to her whereabouts on the side of the apartment that didn't get destroyed. She makes it safely out with the one lunatic neighbor that suddenly thinks they are the new Adam and Eve, because he ""saved"" her ?

The scenery was good, especially that bit near the end with an ash-covered Seattle. So three stars.I didn't mind the way it ended. It was a journey - a road trip under disaster conditions and that works for me, as a story. But it was badly done.The movie failed to show reason why everyone became so homocidal. The only arguments anyone made- all the way through - were 'We've got to do this thing' and in the case of Tom and Will, 'We've got to get to Sam'. But why, guys? And what if she's coming to you?I hated that they were so worried about poor helpless Sam yet they didn't show any concern or consideration for Rikki. Why was that? Because Sam was family? But Rikki was right there with them, in the journey. Why should a viewer care what happens to jerks like them?When Rikki got upset about killing someone, all they could say was 'You did good, you saved us.' Yeah. How could Rikki not feel reassured? And 'We're going to stay right here for a bit."" Hmm. Way to not address her concerns one bit. I'm guessing Will was the cleaner in that lawyer's office, right? His character sure wasn't showing negotiating skills in this movie.The wrecked army train was a decent bit of filming that went entirely to waste. They might have gotten themselves a vehicle much more suited to the situation - or a first aid kit maybe and ration packs. Or heaps more fuel. Or at the very least, they could try for some military communications or even, maybe see what actually happened to cause that derailment? Or if they really wanted maybe see if there was a living but trapped driver? But no. None of that.That blocked airwaves scene with the biro/straw/tube cure that is a common feature of poorly written disaster movies! Very disappointing to see it yet again.Family with the jeep - they had a prime resource and disrespectful Will waited till the mother was off with the kid before strong-arming the father into trading it. Women in general had no voice at all in this movie. It makes perfect sense to have some women needing help and support - but all of them? The only one who was self sufficient and resourceful was treated very badly until she had to leave.Jeremiah at the end spouting off his theory and Will's irrational contempt. The guy might have been wrong but there were elements to his theory that were worthy of consideration. They didn't warrant a 'What the f*** are you talking about?'.And finally - Sam is okay with the fact that Will has turned into a maniacal killer? Maybe if there's a sequel, she'd pull a Rikki too and vanish in the night. We can only hope that was the intention. But we should also hope there is no sequel.",How It Ends

I just opened an account not only to review this movie but also to respond to all of the condescending, smug, and ""I'm smarter than you"" reviews from people who are basing their approval on eye candy, big explosions, and an ending that they want others to think they loved and understood, in order to make themselves feel intellectually superior. The long and short of it is that it was a bad movie. I can elaborate on the many many plot holes, the weak, exhausting tropes that are thrown in over and over and over again (""hey man, I'm military, you're military, just let me through this massive roadblock because I'm military, and you're military and were brothers."" ""Well now that you put it that way, sure go ahead and go through, my brother military guy."" - The actual script wasn't that far off in terms of originality.). Oh, and I guess that one roadblock was able to keep the roads clear from every single car except theirs for the next 2000 miles. Seems legit.No, it's not just the ending. Yes the ending is bad, and not in a diminished intellect kind of way as most 10 star reviewers would have you believe. It was the combination of two hours worth of poor writing, poor acting, unnecessary characters, zero character development, sloppy continuity errors... If anything, this movie dependeded on low intellect in order to sell it. That's not to say that you could only enjoy this movie if you have low intellect, I'm just saying that the creators of this movie threw in as many of what they thought were necessary elements to keep the attention of action movie viewers:*Love story with girlfriend who happens to be pregnant (A detail, by the way that is completely meaningless and does not move the story whatsoever, except for a weak attempt at emotional connection to the character)*Fight with future father-in-law to try and force tension and accentuate the ""enemies becoming allies with a common mission"" trope*Gunfighting, car chasing, explosions (yawn) I can see the meeting now: "" The kids are gonna love this!""*A long, tense road trip, with forcibly quirky characters thrown in for no good reason, who are abruptly written out when the writers grow tired of them.*Again with the empty roads. Is no one else trying to head west to check on family members? *Ah, the old life lessons and ""promise to take care of my daughter"" while coughing blood routine. We've never seen THAT before.*He has time for a hillbilly Viking funeral? He couldn't have found better use for that gas, say, perhaps to put into another car?*Hope you didn't fall asleep for 30 seconds, because you would've gone from on the road looking for girlfriend to found girlfriend in a remote cabin in the woods (via a completely obliterated city wherein he is the only living human)*Uh oh, sexual tension between boyfriend and neighbor guy who rescued helpless pregnant girlfriend.* The girl is mine! No she's mine! I will kill you for her! No I will kill you! (*sigh*)* some last-minute addition to the script intended to sound epic and romantic before abrupt end, but completely forgettable. So no, this movie wasn't bad because of just the ending. It was bad because it was everything movies shouldn't be. It was insulting to the intelligence of film lovers. It was a weak attempt at yet another post-apocalyptic genre film. Avoid. Or watch. I don't really care.",How It Ends

1025,capcidhighwind,"Good Cinematography, Little Else",2,15 July 2018,"There is so much wrong with this film. The only parts worth watching are the gorgeous scene transitions that showcase wide shots of some beautiful scenery. The wide shots of areas affected by disaster are also a sight to behold and kept me watching just so I could find out what was going on. This turned out to be my biggest disappointment.The acting is nothing special. Forest Whitaker sleepwalks through the film as the brash, unlikable Tom. Theo James mostly just looks perturbed by everything going on around him as the idiotic Will. Seriously, the decisions this character makes are some of the most frustrating parts of the movie. How many times do you have to stop and get held at gunpoint before you CEASE PULLING OVER EVERY FEW MILES? The rest of the films characters are pretty much forgettable. Kat Graham's Sam, Will's pregnant wife and Tom's only daughter, hardly makes a difference to the story, regardless of the fact that her safety drives the characters forward. The only standout is Grace Dove's Native American character, Ricki, who comes and goes in the most unsatisfying and tenuous fashion. She just HAPPENS to want to go where these guys are going and the promise of money is enough to make her leave her home (and perhaps escaping an abusive parent, who oddly makes no protest to her departure). Then, after causing the death of strangers who held the heroes at gunpoint and stole their gas, she leaves for...well, what reason? Somehow she blames Will and Tom for what happened? Not sure why. And she literally just disappears. Like Sam, she has zero bearing on the story. Why even bother?The sub-par acting and unlikable characters aside, the film is literally the same scenario over and over. They drive a while, they pull over for some dumbass reason (or no real reason at all), get held up, have to escape or otherwise get out of the situation they've put themselves in, rinse and repeat. Until Tom dies from broken ribs sustained in the most wimpy-looking accident committed to film (seriously, swerving to miss some deer in the road and sliding into a ditch isn't enough to knock Will out for however long and break a grown man's ribs, it's ridiculous when you see it) and then Will finally reaches Seattle.THANK HEAVENS an abandoned firetruck still possesses a respirator for him to use as he traverses the ash-covered, ruined Seattle landscape. I guess the fire station didn't have all hands on deck during the end of the world. And why would they have distributed respirators to some of the people left to die on the bridge? Why wouldn't any of them seek a respirator? Because it was convenient to the plot that Will have one, that's why. Then, after somehow making it to his apartment even though the city is destroyed, he finds a pristine note scrawled on the door from Sam. Finally, a reunion!Then, in the most BAFFLING moment in the movie, the clearly unstable neighbor who took Sam to safety, Mark O'Brien's Jeremiah, posits a potential explanation for what's going on and Will absolutely loses his cool. It's out of left field. He just gets ultra pissy at the guy who saved his wife and baby because of a theory? The character motivations in this film are some of least sensible I've seen. Then the neighbor acts shady, tries to kill Will, but Will kills him and then the earth shakes, Will and Sam jump in the car and barely outrun what most people seem to think is a pryoclastic flow and that's it. Wow. Not even any real payoff. There's the disappointment I talked about earlier.By far, the most frustrating aspect of this movie is Will. He barely emotes and when he does, it never feels appropriate to the situation. His constant decisions to stop or otherwise get himself and Tom into trouble make him a difficult character to root for. And I'm sure we're meant to root for him. But I couldn't. He should have been dead three or four times over, but because this is boiler plate from top to bottom, he lives and rides off into oblivion with his girlfriend and future babyboy. To what? Who knows? Without Tom to get him out of trouble, I'm going to take the screenwriter at his suggestion to make my own ending by presuming Will stopped for someone a few miles up the road and he and Sam were immediately killed for the vehicle and supplies they may or may not have had with them. That feels about right.",How It Ends

Or Sam's mom, because Will decides to head North at the end with Sam instead of going back to Chicago to let her know her husband is dead and her daughter is ok. So there's that. Worst plot point- Will talking Tom and Rikki into going out of their way to stop by a friend's house so he can take a shower and refill his water jugs up at her expense. They literally are there for that long and it's ""thanks for your limited resourses but I gotta go"" and they leave. Oh, and he drank a soda I think. Maybe it was a beer because his friend apparently just leaves the empties on the kitchen countertop instead of throwing anything away. Second worst plot point was immediately after they left there and they stop at a waterslide (yes, a waterslide) to ""look for supplies"". I like how Will tries to talk Rikki out of jumping in the pool. This after him being the only one freshly showered after a five day road trip through hell. Nice work, Will.

1093,Unionparkster,A fine entry in the EOTW genre and also a road-trip buddy movie,10,14 July 2018,"First time posting a review on IMDb; I've thought about it quite a few times but just put it off. But I feel I have to jump in and say a few words in defense of How It Ends. First of all, what seems to be most people's main gripe; the ending. I don't think it's a spoiler to say that, yes, it feels a bit abrupt. But how does anyone think a situation like this would actually play out if something like it did happen? It's probably not going to be all tied up in a tidy package; there's bound to be a lot of uncertainty.The other major complaint seems to be that the movie doesn't ""explain"" what is happening. If something of this magnitude took place, it's likely that all the carefully made plans and communications infrastructure will be overwhelmed. There's plenty of ""what"" happening to the characters, and they have no time to really focus on the ""why."" Not knowing adds to the panic and tension. Again, there is no explanation for the phenomena occurring wrapped up and delivered in a tidy box of exposition. I didn't find that a problem.The cast does a fine job, especially the two principals, Whitaker (Tom) and James (Will). Tom has the kind of reservations that many dads have about their daughter's boyfriends, in addition to Will's part in an earlier incident that becomes and interesting plot element later. The two men have to decide to put aside their reservations to work together and trust each other, fast. This is where the movie also becomes a variant on the road-trip buddy film. If you give this movie a chance and focus on the characters, their interactions, the dilemmas they face and the moral choices they have to make, I think you will find this film quite enjoyable.",How It Ends

1096,chinatmoore,"Didn't Get it? A LAYERED Film with a FITTING, UPLIFTING ENDING!",8,22 July 2018,"Some reviewers seemed REALLY confused about the ending, making their overall response pretty unsatisfied. But you may be taking things too literally.I REALLY LIKED THIS MOVIE! Initially a conventional story about a father (Whitaker's Tom) disapproving of the guy (James' Will) seeing his daughter (Graham's Sam), when suddenly, symptoms of a major disaster occur. The populace becomes increasingly then completely confused, cutoff, and panicked by the loss of services we modern folk take for granted...BUT, there are LAYERS to this movie:
1. Obvious, literal, visible; 
2. Creeping examination; 
3. Characters + Events = SYMBOLS; 
4. Filmmakers' overall answerIt is the LOSS of services that forms the nature and style of the storytelling. We ARE NOT supposed to know WHY and WHAT specifically happened, at least not right away. We ARE supposed to be IN the story, feeling the same confusion, panic, tension, and fear, only seeing subtle hints as to what *might* be going on as we survive minute to minute, day to day...As the story continues, Tom and Will MUST get to the very place where the disaster seems to have started, because that's where Sam is, and what we see on screen is the obvious, literal showing of the pursuit of that goal playing out. (Layer 1)Along the journey (it literally occurred to me 75% through) each encounter is an examination into examples of how people *could* behave once such panic and paranoia set in, *ALL* due to lacking *COMMUNICATIONS*, and further poses the question of how anyone can retain any sense of decency, humanity, and efficacy within such a scenario (Layer 2).Additionally, (this blew my mind) the deeper backbone deals with shifting differences between generations: Tom is old-school, Will is new-school, and the disaster is the 'wave' of change, the handing off of control to a generation without ""a plan"" that ""doesn't know how to work"", and even feels super-entitled for *NO real* reason. And there are other characters who are representations/symbols, and fittingly, their actions don't quite follow logic (*they shouldn't!*). (Layer 3)The ending, *purposefully* abrupt as it is, IS THE FILMMAKERS' ANSWER to the whole story, their whole examination and exploration into some aspects of human behavior. The answer is actually quite uplifting, when you keep in mind what had happened just before and what is currently happening on screen, along with remembering Will's actions, behaviors, and overall choices throughout the story. That abruptness is essentially a mic-drop, after which I instantly thought, ""Holy $%^&!!"" upon the fade to black (Layer 4)!!Ultimately, it's not the disaster itself that matters, it's what the disaster REPRESENTS: What forms the deepest parts of society and human behavior? How would we react and adapt to any changes in those deepest parts? Whatever the answer, it would determine the path of the very nature of humanity...To address the disaster itself, all you need to do is pay attention to the strange things happening in the world--don't only listen to the ramblings of other panic-stricken people in the movie trying to come up with answers.Consider the following (everything below can be seen in the trailers, so it's not actually a spoiler):1. First the rumblings and dropped calls. ""Reports of a seismic event"", said another way is, 'something about Earth's crust moved'. Ever seen a cellphone tower? They require power to carry signals that send and receive calls. That's why when people are too far away from a cellphone tower, they get no bars. People prepared to be in remote places (no power, so no cellphone towers) know this, and as seen in plenty of movies, THEY BRING SAT PHONES. So, Earth's crust moves somehow and power cables break; lose power, lose communications.2. Strange behavior in flocking birds. If you've heard anything about birds other than what lives in cities, you may have heard that birds have senses humans don't. One of these senses is VITAL for navigation, especially to birds that migrate over long distances. What they're sensing is out of whack...3. Falling Ash. There have been enough movies about what causes this...4. Crazy storms. What's the name of that sudden burst of light that causes a really loud sound when it's raining? And what's that burst of light made of, that we also use every day at the flip of a switch? How do we even get that thing, and how can it possibly relate to that vital sense in birds?None of the above relates to what a bunch of people guess at in this movie. And I can't describe the other things because they aren't in the trailers. Point is, the causes of the occurrences (hints about the root of the disaster) seen in the film and stated above can be learned in any required introductory earth science class...This film is not a pilot to some show, nor is it sloppy or shameful. It is actually a fascinating work of art that isn't supposed to be taken ONLY literally. ""FREE YOUR MIND"" and watch this movie again with attention focused on the metaphors and symbols. There's really something great to get from this, if you'd just open up to it!!",How It Ends

1147,marykools,Abandon all hope ye who watch,3,5 August 2018,"Not quite sure why other reviewers didn't think there was an ending. There was, depending on what you think the ""it"" is in the title. If you think ""it"" refers to the world or the crisis, then no, there is no ending. If you think ""it"" refers to Will's journey to find Sam, then yes, there is an ending, albeit a pretty unfulfilling one.That being said, I concur with other reviewers regarding how crappy this movie was. Forest Whittaker is an amazing actor; however, this was not an amazing role. The characters were exaggerated and difficult to sympathize with. I don't think they could have made Will seem like a bigger douche. Just when you think he might redeem himself, he does something else cringy.So much of this movie defies logic. The water is so hot in the pool at the water park that the girl can't bathe in it, but the air is breathable and the people can be outside. Will needs a gas mask in the outskirts of Seattle, but doesn't need it once he gets into the city. The US goes to hell in a hand basket in 5 days and violence prevails. I normally don't give much weight to reviews, preferring to form my own opinion, but in this case, I wish I'd taken their advice and skipped this movie.",How It Ends
1148,bandak_amjad,Very predictable with the worst ending,1,5 December 2018,"Wasted my time watching this movie. No character development, weak plot and with the worst ending possible. Do not watch it",How It Ends
1149,hilcovb,"Interesting premise, but poor execution",5,29 July 2018,"First off, I have to give the movie credits for intriguing me enough to write my first ever review.And How It Ends definitely has some strong features. First there's the premise: A couple in a crucial life changing part of their lives, with a baby on board, living together and moving to a new house in another part of the country. Then disaster strikes, with the movie giving very little information to both the characters and the audience, and the woman's soon-to-be husband and father set out to find her, while having a bad relationship with eachother that escalated just the night before.The first few minutes delivers in character development between Will and Sam, and especially between Will and Tom. Character development later in the movie is somewhat underwhelming. Partly because Theo James (Will) is lacking in acting skills imo, but also simply because of how the dialogue was written.
I mean, it's still way above average compared to most typical blockbuster disaster or action movies, but for a road movie where not a lot happens, you should expect dialogue and character development to at least be memorable (in a good way).The way the movie shows and informs you about the disaster I think is its best feature. It's atmospheric, dark and full of mystery. It makes sure you know as much about what is happening as the characters and it gives you clues along the way that makes you think and deduct about what could be the cause.
First of course the power cut and lack of reception for radio/telephone/etc., then the F22s, the army road block on the highway, the train full of military equipment, the compass going haywire, the superstorm (which actually didn't appear that special, but ok), the gradual deconstruction of civilization, the fires, rumbling and ashes. At different times with new clues I got reminded of the likes of The Walking Dead, Jericho, The Road, Deep Impact and more. All with different causes and developments of the apocalypse, but now in one movie.Usually I get frustrated by characters making stupid decisions, or by illogical or unlikely (chains of) events.
The characters weere actually pretty smart, and their decisions were definitely on or above par compared to a normal real person would handle it. Sure there were some annoying moments, but that really wasn't the issue with this movie.What was an issue was simply unexplainable behaviour and events that made no sense.
Why was the convict in the police car so eager to chase them down?Why didn't Tom seek medical help when they were allowed to enter the village?Why did Tom and Will primarily drive on (often even unpaved) back roads and not on main roads? Will said something about the highway being too dangerous, but when did that happen? And the unpaved dwindling roads worked out so well for them?Where were all the people west of the army road block?Where was the law and order west of the army road block?Why did civilization degrade so quickly to almost Walking Dead proportions just because of power cut and lack of modern communication? I'm not talking about the Seattle area btw.How did Will suddenly become a class A stunt driver and marksman?You notice the rapid increase in unexplainable events or behaviour nearing the end of the movie.The situation with the neighbour who saved his girlfriend, I believe Jeremiah is his name, deserves special attention.Why did Jeremiah act so strange around Will to begin with? I was guessing that Jeremiah maybe thought he could hook up with Sam, and Will shattered that opportunity by showing up. But then how did Jeremiah develop such an obsessive crush on her in a few days?
But then Will was acting equally strange towards Jeremiah. You know, the guy who saved his girlfriend's life. Getting pretty much enraged by Jeremiah's explanation on what the disaster was, and being generally very suspicious about Jeremiah. And within a day we have a standoff where Will shoots first... It really made zero sense to me.Then there is some more rumbling, and apparently some special kind of rumbling, because suddenly Will knows another catastrophic event is happening and they have to leave immediately without even getting supplies (it seemed). I would think if someone would even know how to detect an incoming disaster it would be Sam, because she was actually there when it happened in Seattle.They barely escape the, at least, several mile wide 'eruption' by mere meters, and without any cut or any jump in time the drive off for 10 seconds and the movie ends. This wasn't a carefully planned or executed open ending. This really felt like: ""The protagonists survive the climax aaaand...."" I have no more ideas, so we'll just stop there.And so will I with this review.",How It Ends

1177,mattollom1014,"Great start, bad story telling.",2,27 July 2018,"If you just watch the trailer you will get just as many answers as you would by watching the movie, and save a ton of time.I was looking forward to this movie after seeing the teaser on Netflix. I'm not an ""end of the word, disaster movie fan,"" but this one excited me. In the beginning it seemed to have the promise of a great movie, it was everything the trailer had made it out to be. But shortly after it became horribly obvious that the writers were in over their heads.It starts out with the main character, Will (Theo James), going to ask his girlfriend's dad, Tom (Forrest Whitaker), for her hand in marriage. Out of that we get a weird, awkward argument between the father-in-law to be and the fiance. I was able to look past the argument because most movies have an awkward moment, but it just got worse from there.I didnt even care that the ending left you with no answers. I would have been ok with that if the story telling wasn't so awful. It all started with how quickly the public turned on each other. The first night on the road they are chased down by some maniac in a cop car who continues to chase them if for no other reason than to chase them. Then there is Ricki (Grace Dove). The Indian girl from the reservation that decides to go with Will and Tom even though she has her doubts about them. At one point on the trip she jumps into a pool only to quickly jump right back out saying how hot the water is. I had assumed this was prelude as to what was happening, but that was the end of it. It was never alluded to again. Then after freaking out about people getting killed Ricki just gets quiet and abandons Will and Tom without ever carrying the story forward. Other than fixing the car there was no reason for the character in the movie. It was just fluff to prolong the movie.Then Tom dies for no other reason than to die, again it does nothing to move the story.To wrap it all up Will finally finds his wife who he was searching for since the disaster, but there is more awkwardness there. It's obvious that the man that saved her before Will showed up was into her. But when he gives his theory about what has happened Will is strangely filled with rage by the mans suggestion. So to wrap it up, they could have ended it the way they did and still had a good movie, if only the story telling between the beginning and end made sense. Unfortunately that was a not the case.",How It Ends

Dead people in their cars because they can't breath and there just happens to be a mask there. Also, when he gets to his Dad's place in Idaho, there's three weeks of food! Really, three weeks?! I'm pretty certain that place would have been looted days ago by people exiting the coast.
Anyway, this movie really had the potential to do better. The plot was too predictable and the character development needed improvement. Other than that, a decent movie to watch if you wanna kill some time.",How It Ends

To fix the car IF it broke down? To get to LA even if nobody has any contact with the whole Western side of America? And then just leave, making the whole character pointless anyway. She basically just got in the way of some potentially interesting character development between Tom and Will. And for two people in a race against time to travel across the country to save someone they loved they seem to stop a lot. Also one burning question I have is why, when their car is ambushed and their gas is stolen does that woman suddenly call them terrible people despite the fact that they tried to help her?

No! But was it well made, well acted, with tense action sequences and characters you care about? Yes! Did it have a complex plot? No! It's a quest. ""Save the princess!""

That's part of the appeal (think 'hurricanes forming over land' in The Day After Tomorrow, or massive tsunamis in just about everything). This movie was high caliber, well acted and impressively realistic (or at least how I imagine the aftermath of a catastrophic event would be). Communications are down, society as we know it comes to a screeching holt. Progress is slow and suspenseful. The characters are battling their way through with the information they have, what has caused the event is irrelevant. The real danger, like in the Walking Dead, is people.

A good quarter of the movie seems to be artsy video of the Cadillac they happen to be driving. They delicately tape off the tail lights so the car still looks ""sexy"" even when they want to be stealthy. If I had to guess, part of the 20,000,000 budget was given by Cadillac... but that being said its not big of a deal and doesn't impact the plot. The beginning is pretty good, its all pretty predicable, but hey what 'end of the world' movie isn't a little. One last thing, for those that have already watched it, did you notice that the stills Netflix uses for the film on its website are Photoshoped images from different parts of the movie? For instance, in the cover image on Netflix, the jeep is magically bright red, and in one of the other frames, the white actor is wearing a smoke mask next to Forest Whitaker which also never happens.

1407,reecedavidj,Hot Dumpster Fire,1,14 July 2018,"I literally created an IMDb account in order to rate this movie. Besides the unbelievably terrible script, bad character development, unrealistic time-based events, and disjointed filming-this movie created no character or plot intrigue and left you wanting oh so much more to be desired. How many Americans think that using the f word that many times is normal conversation for anyone? Maybe I'm a minority here, but it made the characters and plot less believable and made everyone seem unintelligent-yet they're surviving a global catastrophy based on wit and brain power?? Not sure the two line up that we'll. This movie, since we never learned anything about the catastrophy (except at the very end from a poorly portrayed explanation from a character we don't know and don't really trust), this movie should be more about characters than anything, but they were so underdeveloped and uninteresting and disconnected that they ruined the movie. Then there's the car... a brand new Cadillac that we're supposed to believe needs a ride-along mechanic for a 2,065 mile trip across the country? Come now. Barring a major CARtastrophy, there should be no need for maintenance on this type of trip-let alone the need to constantly check to make sure it's running okay... a 1998 Camry, sure, but not this caddy. Also, how long does it take to get to Seattle from Chicago? On a normal day with normal traffic, 31 hours. But it took Will 6 days. 6. Days. I could believe 3 under the circumstances, but 6 was a bit much and made it impossible to believe anything else the writers included in this sub-par film. We had to watch until the end so that we could see how poorly it ended and if will found Sam again. And well, it did. End poorly, that is. And then they drove off into the dust-set without a word as the WHERE THEY'D BE GOING EXCEPT NORTH WITHOUT A PLAN AND WITHOUT SUPPLIES. Insert face palm.

The way that random robber insisted on finding them, driving off the road and the way he died was disappointing. After ""Tom"" dies the movie just goes downhill. I liked Theo James in the Divergent series but here it looked like he was playing a different part than the one needed. Not sure if it was his fault.
Didn't get at all ""Will's"" reaction to the neighbor's theory when they sat by the fire. Why would anyone get that angry, especially with the person that saved your wife (even if he gives away a bad vibe). That full scene was completely off in my view.Kat Graham character had no structure.The end was just a joke.The general feeling was that they are going to make a sequel, as there are too many holes in the plot.

1429,jjccpa,Captivating and Well Acted,7,7 November 2018,"Everyone complains about the non-ending. There was an ending, it's just doesn't wrap things up definitively. In fact the ""ending"" as I saw it was 15 minutes long. Much is left to the imagination which sadly is eroding from our society. If you are under 25 and spend 50% of your life taking pictures of yourself with bunny ears, you probably won't like this movie because it forces you to think and there is zero instant gratification. You won't be told exactly what the disaster is and there aren't battles with aliens or anything like that. You are left just as confused and freaked out as the characters had to be.Where the film succeeds is in human interactions that are realistic and not over the top or ridiculous. In life or death situations there are people who will help you, and there are those that will look out only for themselves. Those scenes are where the edge of your seat moments are.Another complaint I've read from many reviewers is that the protagonists make stupid mistakes. Like, not looking for better weapons or supplies and not asking other people who are walking away from the disaster ""what happened?"" whilst they drive towards it. Again, if you can't think, then you can't realize that you need to suspend disbelief just a tad. Or, there's no movie. Everyone would immediately save themselves, there'd be no build up, no chance for characterization, and well, again, no movie to watch.I gave it a fair review. Not a 10 because I liked it and wanted my opinion to have the weight of a 10. If Shawshank is a 10, this is a 6 or 7. Entertaining, suspenseful, and well acted. And it's not low-brow.

It started off with that feeling and had me wondering what was happening in an exited way in which I had to carry on watching, to see what was actually happening to civilisation.
However, the further into the film I got the more bored I got.
It was just a basic storyline with a few scenes thrown in to try and make it exiting. Like the bridge scene with the bikers, the two lads trying to steal their fuel etc etc.... they were just boring and felt pointless and didn't bring anymore excitement to storyline.
Thinking about it, The main actor must of been the luckiest bloke in the world. Travelling from east to west, he comes across a friends house on the way , comes across his parents house on the way, he comes across a mechanic who he takes with him, on the way. He finds more fuel from a crashed train, on the way. How convenient.

1496,cremonacotovelea,There are also metaphors! There is an ending!,10,15 July 2018,"The reason that made me write this was because of the pretty mean but also infantile comments from IMDb, but especially the fact that it was obvious that these persons proved that, in fact, they did not understand at all the message of the movie and demonstrating only their shallowness.Yes, the title could make you judge the film in a simplistic way, but actually the title is well chosen. Let me explain them...Even literally, the title could refer to the end of the world and not only at the ending of the protagonists' adventures. Perhaps, a better title, in order to be understood by everyone, would have been ""The Initiation"", because this is what the movie talks about. It is about gearing up the son-in-law to make him able to protect the daughter and unborn nephew in this ""new"" world. I don't think you wanted the film to veer to ""The Walking Dead"", or, by the way in which the set is presented, to a prequel for ""The Road"", isn't it? Is that what you wanted? Psycho rednecks? Zombies? Cannibals running through the landscape with a cleaver in their hands? I do not think so. Then you would have said that the movie is one of many others and it does not bring anything new, right?The basic idea of the movie would be: Do not lose your humanity, but neither your reason. Meaning: don't do evil deeds on purpose, but also don't let you trampled by others.To be more specific, here is not about the whole of humanity or solving the general situation, but only about ""him and her"" as they become fit to survive. The ending is like in the old western movies where the hero rides into the sunset at the end of the film, towards more adventures. Here, they are leaving the storm which represents the danger and driving into the clear that represents hope and new chances.In what regards the jokes about the denouement - that Netflix didn't have the money to continue or that the whole crew have gone to lunch and forget to shoot the ending), they only prove - once again - what I said above: shallowness...That's what I had to say. As for the movie, I do not think that Netflix, if they wanted more, could not have made a TV series. Would it have been better? Would that have been understood by everybody? I don't think so; sometimes you just have to think. Therefore, pay attention to the message not only to the raw action. For a TV movie, ""How It Ends"" is a good one, well acted and I believe that it's worth watching.Therefore my dear, don't be so hasty. Stop from time to time and think for yourselves. And keep in mind that there are not only subjects and predicates. There are also metaphors!Enjoy!",How It Ends

Furthermore, this movie fails miserably at explaining what catastrophe has actually taken place, is it aliens? Is it a supervolcano? Is it earthquakes? What the actual cause of the apocolpyse is will never be revealed, so I guess we have to use our imaginations. 
Moreover, characters just seem to drop off the screen, with no real explanation as to where they went, if they're safe, or why they left in the first place. 
This was a tragically written movie script that suffered in many different areas. So much so that the average person reading this review could have wrote a better script in many parts of this movie. 
Lastly, the ending of this movie was a complete and utter fail. There's no explanation as to anything, and the screen just goes black with credits right in the middle of a suspenseful part. I guess that too is suppose to be left up to the imagination to figure out. I have not watched a movie this bad in a long time, and with a strong cast, you'd think it would've been better. 
In conclusion, You shouldn't waste your time watching this flick, as the screen writers obviously didn't waste their time and just bashed together some silly little story line that makes no sense. I don't usually write reviews for movies, but this one was just that bad as to make me voice my opinion. If you do watch the movie, please write a review on what your thoughts of the ending were, and how you would've done it differently, as I'm sure the vast majority of you could've pulled it off better.",How It Ends

Imagine A Day After Tomorrow with the entire movie being Nick Cage making his way to NYC.

They continue to bring up Forest's military experience and I feel like they are trying to make him into a Denzel Washington like character but I just don't see it from him in this movie. This is a end of the world type movie yet is anything explained? They show the characters driving through devastated areas yet no one knows what's going on? If it's aliens then wouldn't it be easier to destroy these cities with conventional warfare instead of using natural disasters? Another thing that bothers me is that they make it seem easy navigating through a demolished Seattle. Have you ever driven through Seattle on a normal day?

But where I actually shouted ""Give me a ******* break!!"" was when Will stepped up in to the disabled fire engine and pulled out a FREAKIN' GAS MASK and walked around with it.With three minutes of research, or hell just paying attention to the commonplace world, you would know that fire engines do not carry 'gas masks'. They carry SCBA with a limited air supply and the mask does not have filter cartridges. Like the rifles in The Walking Dead with no rear sights.Details like that ruin shows for people with even the slightest technical knowledge and it's embarrassing that they cut corners like that to fool people.Anyway, it was alright.

No. Just like every other blockbuster movie with a cliffhanger (Inception, District 9, Shutter Island, The Dark Knight Rises), How It Ends leaves you with something to think about. The movie wasn't titled ""A detailed description of how the world is ending."" The description of the movie specifically says ""In the midst of an apocalypse, a man struggles to reach his pregnant wife, who is thousands of miles away."" THATS EXACTLY THE PLOT OF THE MOVIE. It tells you from the start what to expect. The suspense of wondering what is going on in the world, what types of dangers will they encounter, and who will actually make it the whole way, keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole movie. It tells the story of how a salty, retired Marine father takes along his snowflake son-in-law on a drive across the Northern part of America (which does, in fact, contain a LOT of gravel roads, farm lands, and country folk willing to protect it) to save the one person they both love more than anything in different ways. The main character has to learn the ways of his wife's father in order to survive in such an environment. The movie amazingly tells that story. Not the story of how the earth is randomly ending and how it can be stopped. It's not some typical ""oh hey, I'm some random nobody trying to save my family but I also happen to fall exactly in the middle of how the government is going to stop everything!""

It has the standard beginning where the characters are introduced. And it has an action filled middle sequence that gives you the main story. What makes it stand out from other post-disaster movies (I had a huge 2012 deja vu feeling while watching this movie) is that there is no ending. Like credits roll right after an action packed scene. Sure, there is a little bit of resolution. Will finally meets his wife and finds out just a tad bit of information about what the hell is going on in the world. But the movie ends just as they escape a pursuing ash cloud with only seconds to spare. It reminded me of 10 Cloverfield Lane or the Cloverfield Paradox.

An volcano? Earthquake?Your guess is as good as mine, because even after the loved one is found, nothing will be answered in this movie. It just ends after the girl is found.

1606,taylorcowin,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,5,21 July 2018,There's just so much wrong with this movie that it's hard to know where to start. It's awful.,How It Ends
1607,corporaterelations,The movie ended when the script was green-lighted.,2,21 July 2018,"The movie ""How It Ends"" narrates the story of Will (Theo James), Tom (Forrest Whitaker) and their attempt to rescue Sam (Kat Graham) while travelling across the country through what seems to be the beginning of the Apocalypse. I will spare you from what many reviews have already stated and instead point out other elements that may help you decide whether this movie is worth watching, buying or furthermore thrashing (yes, even bad movies deserve a viewing chance if seen with the right perspective in mind). First, the highlights. The movie has a good starting premise (beginning of the apocalypse, the unknowns of what would happen and what would you do if you were in the characters' circumstances). Mr. Whitaker's performance was acceptable - being the most senior and visible in the cast - and Mr. James' performance demonstrates potential for future more reasonable roles (being capable of carrying the weight of a full movie production, I am sure this was a step up career wise, Mr. James, please keep at it). Unfortunately, that is where the pleasantries end. Now let's get on with the bad: while the visuals were very reasonable for a limited budget movie, there is extensive use of close ups and narrow lenses.They do provide a sense of closeness - however, this is a road trip movie. For the most, no open spaces are seen while the dialogue goes on or while the characters interact with their environment (maybe they just ran out of time and they had to roll this movie out for the summer?).Finally, my worst criticism and where I think there is significant work to be done (and it was clearly under control of the producers) was the simplistic approach to dialogues. Again, I do not blame the actors since I have seen Mr. Whitaker in highly elaborate performances and again Mr. James is early in his career so he still has a chance to see better projects. However, the dialogues are abysmally disengaging. To be fair to the crew, I blame more the studio for approving a script that needed more work. The point is, simple use of language and good script development and implementation is hard and unfortunately ""How It Ends"" failed at it. Possibly the writer (or writers) aimed for simplicity as a way to reach a broader audience, yet in their attempt they clearly lost their way and fell into a trap that ended their movie, just like their plot, without finding a way to connect with the audience. As I said at the beginning, each movie deserves at least one viewing, yet, because of the dialogues I was hoping Netflix could give me my 1:53 hrs back (well about 1:50, since I could not bear myself to see the credits as I felt bad for the crew which clearly worked hard at making this movie possible). Now you have been warned. Please see at your leisure.",How It Ends

It can't be referring to the movie because it doesn't have one. The film actually had me pretty intrigued until about midway through, and then they just decided to rehash the same scenario over and over again instead of develop any plot or provide any tantalizing reveals of the cause of the disaster. I'm not going to call the final 5-10 minutes of the movie an ending because it wasn't one. It's like the production crew just ran out of money and the producer said screw it, release the thing anyway.

The movie gives you nothing more than the characters know, but that is still more than enough to know what is going on. They show you the compass, the flying animals being confused as to direction, the aurora borealis.The earth's magnetic poles are shifting direction, and the movie just ran with the worst case scenario of what this might mean.

1637,andreandpaula-41493,A good idea painfully executed with glaring plot holes. Ignore them at your peril.,5,28 July 2018,"Whilst I am not giving this a 1 out of 10 it really only deserves a 5. And like many I do have frustrations about the ending which is a shame as the premise of the movie had huge potential. 
The majority of people are giving this a bad review and it does certainly deserve that. I get that there is a small undercurrent of positive reviews and these tend to be from those who wish to interpret more in a movie than was there, or are the type who believe all movies had deep concepts the director wishes to convey. Having read the positive reviews I struggle to see their point of view. Personally I see movies as entertainment firstly and moral crusades as an afterthought. I am certainly not keen on Hollywood trying to project a form of American world view philosophy upon my spiritual self. For me it is primarily entertainment and that is exactly why this movie has to receive a low score (even if subliminal concepts do exist in its script.)
On the positive side the casting is good; the cinematography is for the most part good and atmospheric. I also do feel for some of the movie the idea of an apocalyptic environment is well executed. Forrest certainly tries his best and is the most enjoyable character. I find the other characters somewhat flat and Theo James's character very frustrating. 
It's the script holes which hurt this movie the most and I struggle to understand why the positive reviewers are so tolerant of them. Ultimately I can tell how good a film is by how easily I flick my mobile on and play candy crush. Let's just say I completed several levels. 
Ok, so near the beginning Theo is in the airport when the phone call to his partner fails. This is done well and the suspense is set. Then the power fails and chaos begins. With the power failing there is no easy access to news. Why does the power fail especially if this was a west coast event? The obvious explanation at this point is an EMP however there are sufficient systems in place that airraid sirens would have sounded. (This smacks of THE DIVIDE and its absurd starting sequence.) Theo drives back to his prospective in-laws. That journey would have taken an hour. I do not believe some form of information would be trickling through. Sorry cannot buy that at all. 
The story is painted that Theo and Forrest hate each other but begin a raid trip to rescue the daughter. I do get the sense that Forest is a bit of a doomsday prepper and it may be been worth pushing that idea. If he isn't sorry but again you would either probably stay still at hoem to see if power returns or news trickles in, or you will leave the city for the country. You would not trek across the country and for sure you would not leave your wife behind Forrest in a degenerating city. 
So already we lose one character, Forest's wife, and this is a common theme as it becomes clear this is going to be road movie. Except that concept fails. A road movie has a slow and painful deconstruction of characters, a road to Damascus moment perhaps, and a slow reveal of back story. We do not get that in any coherent form. There is a confession about a boating accident but little else. I feel no sympathy towards Theo at all. 
The road trip is also supposed to convey the unravelling of society. Sorry but it won't happen that quickly. We are made well aware the army etc is responding to something. We see jets in the air and train loads of tanks crossing the country. That takes pretty impressive organisation in a world with no power. Realism is destroyed, Instead we are treated to a parade of one dimensional hillbilly characters who shoot first and ask questions later. If society is breaking down so quickly that has to arise from some form of knowledge of impending doom. We get no such hint, just confusion. 
And then there is Rickki. Poor Rickki. (I confess it took me quite a while to work out what sex this person was.) What a pointless and unrealistic character. Chaos is reigning, communication is down and she chooses now to want to leave her two-bit town and seek her fortune in California. No, simply no. In addition would a young (possibly underaged girl, hard to tell) randomly get into a car with two older strangers who have blood on them. 
After a while, (with no real back story) Rickki leaves, twice. I am still confused about that scene I confess. She left, they went to sleep, she left again??? Candy crush won at that point. 
I'll skip ahead a bit to the bridge scene. Idea good, execution bad. Firstly what are all the lights we can see beyond the bridge? Looks like an industrial complex. And how does mild and pathetic Theo, who doesn't own a gun, suddenly learn to do a hand brake turn on narrow bridge. Again we are tantalised with potentially characters but with no back story. I get that for some this is realistic but no, entertainment must always be the primary aim of a movie.
Another character who flew in and out was the friend of Theo in the town. Possibly worst scene in the movie with its lack of empathy and execution. 
Anyway, Forest dies and for some nonsensical reason Theo burns the broken down car? Why? Pointless. Are you afraid someone will fix it? Forrest's death is an absolute wasted event. Hands up everyone who knew he would die. One, two three, four... infinity. Badly executed.
Finally Theo finds his partner. How? Despite the cataclysmic events unfolding in front of her she scribbles it on a wall of her half collapsed apartment. And somehow, despite Seattle being pretty well completely destroyed he manages to drive to the location of her apartment despite there really begin no street markings and signs. 
I will skip the neighbour part as other reviews have already said it. Terribly executed character and highly unlikely scenario of how that plays out. We are also subjected to a pointless sex scene just so we can get a side boob view. 
Then what looks suspiciously like a pyroplastic flow chases them and despite the fact that such flows tend to run and 100's of miles per hour, they put run it and drive off into the the sunset.
The irritation we get no answers is in my opinion amplified but the appearance of the military at several points. Also at one point we are told ham radio is still working so logic says news will travel that way as well and yet it does not. Also where are the survivors who are heading east? There are none -except for Theo's partner it seems!!!! Epic fail as the young like to say. 
There are hints about what happens which is great except they are not even remotely pursued . Looking at the reviews it seems many people missed the TV scene early one which talks about a European heatwave. Then we have the adverse weather, the birds flocking, the aurora, the compass. To me this points at a natural cataclysmic event (climate correction or magnetic pole switch.) We know there was some form of off shore earthquake causing a tidal wave though when we see Seatle there is no flooding but a lot of ash. This hints at either fall out from nuclear explosions, which fits the neighbour's story and the lack of power, but also hints at a supervolcano erruption. The issue with bnoth of theses is a: nuclear attacks do not occur suddenly, there will be political hints perhaps like a US president trying to get his pee-pee tape back. And if a supervolcano went there would be ample warning before hand in the form of earthquakes, lava dome etc. The other glaring issue on both these theories is that the damage we see seems very localised to Seattle within a 100 miles or so. There is no gradual destruction observed during Theo's final drive. 
Personally I still go for a natural event .
So there you go. Yes, I get that this focused on two people so we won't get the full back story but sorry some form of wider information will trickle to them, especially as they head further west. Yes, and I get that sometimes an open ending is good. But those open endings have to be pulled off with skill and aplomb. Take a look at Coverfield (part 1), Alien and Aliens, Terminator, the Mist, often very negative endings without full closure but still a form of closure nonetheless. If this was the end show it FFS.",How It Ends

The ending was the couple very clearly outrunning the ash as it slows down. And for those who can't think for themselves, they'll most likely gather up the mom and brother and head North. As stated earlier in the movie. What others don't realize is this is not an ""end times"" movie, but more so of a ""how America could be devastated,"" end times movie. It was a movie about a major natural disaster, one such as the Yellowstone Volcano erupting and the outcome it would have on the U.S.It seemed obvious to me with the weather patterns, the hot pool that Ricky jumped in, the fires, the grid going down, the cells occasionally picking up signals, the toxic air, and the transportation malfunctions. Very clear warnings with natural disasters.""The most explosive eruption was its first, which produced about 2,500 times the amount of volcanic material as the 1980 destruction of Mount St Helens. Even the most recent blast created an eruptive column so colossal that it coated about 60 percent of the contiguous United States in thick layers of ash.""

Millions of homes could become uninhabitable."" ALTHOUGH WE SAW FRESH WATER AT SOME POINTS, IT WAS MOSTLY IN UNAFFECTED AREAS. BUT THAT ELECTRICITY SURE WAS WONKY, AND THE ROADS SEEMED PRETTY MUCKED UP TO ME. I thought the movie was interesting, and though they could have cut out the crazy neighbor story line and the stupid decision making, I enjoyed it. It wasn't over explained and actually showed the quick but genuine breakdown of society and two people's love for someone. It seems that most of the reviewers here, just have to be told everything.

This movie does not tell it's story as many other Hollywood movies do. The main characters don't explain the situation around them all the time, but it is explained via carefully positioned shots or some situations where you need to figure it out all by yourself.People say that this is a movie without a plot. I just wanted to say that every single detail about the story and what is happening is shown in the movie. Just don't expect a 2012.Some complain about the lack of focus in the movie. I disagree because the movie took the route of 'non-epic' situations. Not everything needs to happen for a reason and characters in this movie act and react as human beings. I'm not going into spoilers, but everyone that watched the movie knows the situations I'm talking about.If you put aside the story, 'How It Ends' has a pretty good cast (not the best, but did the job good), fantastic atmosphere, really intense moments and beautiful visuals.Is it a perfect movie?

Viewers are basically divided into 2 groups:1 - those who watch the apocalyptic films in order to see destruction and special effects. For this group, although the film has good effects, they exist in very little quantity. For this group, the film was miserable not to say lousy, and the ending more than disappointing.2 - those who watch the apocalyptic films to imagine what it would be like to be in such a scenario. For this group, this film, besides putting you in the shoes of the characters who face this chaotic scenario, confronts you with extreme unpredictability within an apocalyptic setting. For this group, the film was great, and the ending was instigating.The producers say the intention of the film was to please the second group. However, for me, who owns the two groups, I would say that the film did very well in what the second group expects, but at the same time it disappoints a lot in what the first group hopes to watch. For me, I would say that a 7-note is of very good size, because although the performances, ambiance and script were good, the effects were far below the desired, and the end in my opinion could have been smarter, because as much as I have a foot in the second group, producers make it clear that the intention is to stretch the plot in other films.As I said, controversial movie ...",How It Ends

1715,z-28720,How It Ends? We May Never Know,9,18 January 2019,"Most people enjoy when the ending of a movie is definite and they are left without questions, this movie is nothing like that and I appreciate it greatly.How It Ends is a thrilling movie that takes us on a trip across the country during post apocalyptic time. All power and communication goes out across the United States and there is no explanation as to why, all we know is that it doesn't look promising; airports, gas stations, and highways are shutting down everywhere. As the main characters, Will (Theo James) and Tom (Forest Whitaker), head west to Seattle from Chicago, in search for Sam (Kat Graham), Will's fiancé and Tom's daughter, they run into some major setbacks.In the beginning of the movie, ""cops"" flash their lights behind them, so they pull over; Tom soon realizes that these are not real cops and they must get away quick. As the delinquents chased them down the road, Tom knew they had to start shooting in order to get them off their backs. Having been in the marine corps for over 27 years, Tom knew how to shoot a gun, and having been a city kid in a high rise all his life, Will had never touched one, ""How do I do it?"" Will questions, ""Put the mag in the gun. Hit the button on the side. Shoot. You gotta do it."" Tom exclaims. As we saw in the Divergent series, Theo James plays an excellent main role. Although somewhat clueless in this movie, his character adds to the suspense, always cutting things closeAlthough this movie was predictable at times, these moments were overwhelmed by suspense and action, which kept my interest the whole way through.I find that this movie can be closely related to the novel Station Eleven. Both in post apocalyptic times, power goes out everywhere, mass chaos, rising crime, and no one knows what is going on. What I love about both of these, is that the end isn't really the end, in either. The endings leave you questioning what may have happened to the characters, which is the best kind of film/novel because it keeps you thinking about it.Peter Flinckenberg did an amazing job filming this movie, from the close up action shots to the panoramic views, every bit of the cinematography was enticing. The way this movie was directed was also brilliant in my opinion, and all credits go to David M. Rosenthal. The way that we don't find out what happens to the characters that Will and Tom meet along the way, just seems so real. If this were to happen in real life, you wouldn't ever know, yet many people would be angry at this aspect of the movie. We see so many movies with perfect, happy endings, it was refreshing to see a film that seems more real than any film I've seen recently.I would recommend anyone to see this movie, but I urge you to not get caught up in the ending or the small roles along the way that we never hear a conclusion about. I am hoping for a sequel but if that doesn't end up happening, I guess that's just How It Ends, and I am perfectly okay with that.",How It Ends
