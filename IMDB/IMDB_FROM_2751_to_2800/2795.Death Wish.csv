0,MartinHafer,"far from ""politically correct"" but brilliant",9,5 March 2006,"I have to say that I have never particularly liked Charles Bronson movies--in particular, his follow-up movies to Death Wish. What was an exceptional film, has been marginalized by two factors--the utter stupidity of DEATH WISH 2, 3, 4, etc. as well as the loud wailing of the ultra-left about how horrible and offensive this film is. One of the later DEATH WISH films shows that Bronson has given up using his trusty .357 Magnum and replaced it with a shoulder-launched rocket! Talk about making a film to appeal to the idiots out there! And as far as the ultra-left goes, I doubt that in many cases these people actually saw DEATH WISH before condemning it in a ""knee-jerk"" way just because it DID have guns and vigilantism.The film is an excellent portrait of an ordinary successful guy living with his family in the big city. One day, all this is interrupted when his wife is murdered and his daughter brutalized by a gang of scum. He's miserable and his life has been totally uprooted. Only later, when a business associate gives him a gun, does he consider looking for vengeance. And, I like how this was handled. He was NOT a jerk or crazy man--especially at first. Instead, he just carried the gun for protection. Trouble came to him--he wasn't initially seeking it. When he is mugged, he shoots back and is later horrified by his actions. But, as the movie continues, you see he then begins to deliberately walk the streets late at night in the hope that the thugs would attack. He never, by the way, solicited these attacks--they just occurred because he had the unmitigated gall to walk the streets after dark. So, he is technically a vigilante of sorts, but he was never a crazed killer and, quite frankly, I didn't shed too many tears when he shot these predators. The film exposed our breakdown in society in the 1970s without explicitly recommending we pack heat and blast away at the bad guys and in the process it really made me think.",Death Wish
1,bkoganbing,The Vigilante Goes Into Business,7,3 March 2008,"The Death Wish films are not my favorite Charles Bronson works. But there's no doubt that Bronson attained his enduring popularity on the strength of the five films in the series.In this the original Death Wish, Charles Bronson introduces us to Paul Kersey, successful architect and family man with wife Hope Lange and married daughter Kathleen Tolan. Bronson's well ordered life takes an abrupt change when a home invasion robbery results in the death of Hope Lange and the rape of Kathleen Tolan.All the acting is done with facial expressions here. Bronson usually plays stoic characters in his films, but in the Death Wish series he never articulates what's going on with him, but you see it in a face that was made for movie closeups in the same way that Gary Cooper's and John Wayne's faces were.A trip out west on a project brings him in touch with a different mentality about settling urban problems and the present of a 32 Caliber pistol from the man he was contracted to work for gives Bronson a whole new outlook. And a mission in life to rid the world of street criminals.1974 may have been the year Richard Nixon had his downfall, but this was the president elected on a law and order platform. George Wallace sent his audiences into delight when he talked about running protesters down with his vehicle. Death Wish struck quite a nerve with the American public because unlike Dirty Harry, Bronson was a citizen like you and me who just decided to act.There are two really good supporting performances in Death Wish. A New Yorker to his fingertips, Vincent Gardenia plays the dogged police detective who's put on the vigilante killer case. And Stuart Margolin as Bronson's western host who presents him with the tool of his trade is also worth noting.In 1982 Bronson finally due to a lot of audience demand and the fact that the money was too good to turn down, repeated his role of Paul Kersey in a series of Death Wish films of varying quality. Nothing like this one though.",Death Wish
2,Leofwine_draca,Gritty vigilante thriller is the most realistic of the series,8,12 June 2016,"Michael Winner's gritty slice of vigilante cinema has finally been released here after twenty-five years of unavailability. Like most films of the period that were ""banned"" as such, seen today this is relatively tame viewing material which has had its effect lessened by what has come since. Nonetheless, Winner's film is still pretty good viewing, a movie that actually has something to say about modern society and man's place in it. It's a film that gave me food for thought, in any case. Unlike the later THE EXTERMINATOR and even DEATH WISH II, this is a film that tones down the sensationalism to concentrate on the morals behind the story.Firstly, the movie is not as unpleasant as I had imagined. The build-up to the actual attack on the wife and daughter is worse than the event itself, and thankfully Winner skims over the gory details other than in a couple of shocking minutes. Bronson's subsequent vigilante crimes on the dark streets of New York are staged well, with crisp photography giving the film a realistic, gritty edge to it. They're also invariably exciting, and without any unnecessary stylish trimmings; Bronson shoots people with an aim to kill, and that's it. There are no over-the-top gun battles a la John Woo; here it's straightforward cold-blooded murder, shot in a matter-of-fact way.Bronson here is actually very good as the grieving husband and father who takes justice in the only way he knows how; the script gives him unusual characterisation which makes you feel for him. For instance, he doesn't just go out and start killing people; it's a gradual process, and scenes of Bronson being physically sick after shooting a man in the stomach remind us that he is human after all. The supporting cast are uniformly great, and watch out for a very young-looking Jeff Goldblum in his first film role as a thug.So, not only is this a very slick thriller, it's also a film with important things to say. Winner is definitely behind Bronson in his actions, and shows the police as the manipulated buffoons that they really are, although he is sure to show both sides of the coin. No doubt the viewer will find himself siding with Bronson over his actions also. An essential slice of the hard-edged world of the '70s, this movie would have been unthinkable back in the peace-loving '60s.",Death Wish
3,SnoopyStyle,Iconic character,8,20 September 2013,"This is the culmination of the unease of the crime filled 70's era as society is seen to be in crisis. Architect Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson) is a liberal in New York City who hasn't held a gun since his father was killed in a hunting accident. Three hooligans break into his home, kill his wife, and rape his daughter. For the first time, he truly sees the dysfunctional city through the ineffectual police and his weak son-in-law. To get a break, he takes a job in Arizona where Paul gets a taste of the Old West ideals. He returns to New York with a gun and a different sense of justice.This tap into an underlying sense of fear in the city and in the wider country. The trip to Arizona broke up the tension after the harrowing home invasion. Maybe they should have shortened it. Maybe they should have had him just watch some old westerns. It was too long of a break. Charles Bronson would create one of the iconic Hollywood characters that would define a decade. And it would define an actor.Watch for Jeff Goldblum as one of the hooligans.",Death Wish
4,Prismark10,Death Wish,6,9 August 2021,"Charles Bronson plays mild mannered New York architect Paul Kersey. A liberal and a conscientious objector in the Korean war.Some white hoodlums that include Jeff Goldblum in his film debut as a thug invade his apartment. Stomp on his wife Joanna (Hope Lange) and rape his married daughter Carol (Kathleen Tolan) while spraying paint on her as well.Kersey is shell shocked when his wife later dies, his daughter is committed to a hospital. His son in law distraught. The police get nowhere trying to find the hoodlums.After Kersey is sent to Arizona on a land development project. He becomes reacquainted with guns and on his return to New York. Kersey finds himself going out late at night and becoming a target for muggers.After blasting a few muggers away. Kersey becomes a cause celebre and the police led by Lieutenant Frank Ochoa (Vincent Gardenia) has to find Kersey and send him away elsewhere.Directed by Michael Winner. The first Death Wish film was a serious but a simplistic attempt to examine the rising crime in major cities and the role of vigilantism. New York was a dangerous place at night, riding a subway in the evening was no picnic.Winner captures and heightens that paranoia and fear of crime. In Bronson the director has an anti hero who could give the criminals two barrels. Make a statement that the city is safe for ordinary folks. It started a wave of vigilante movies.The surprising element of the movie is that Kersey never finds the thugs the killed his wife and violated his daughter. Instead as the film goes on, the criminals become darker in skin colour.Winner also has problems in dealing with the nuances of vigilantism. The dangers of one man becoming judge, jury and executioner. This can be demonstrated when the police hand out rough justice in America. It usually involves immigrant communities and non whites.",Death Wish
5,kosmasp,A man sees red,7,15 July 2007,"That's what the movie is called in Germany. Which kind of means, that a man is going (sort of) crazy! But there's a bit more to it, than just a man that goes crazy here. It's also about taking the law into one's own hands! Charles Bronson major role was in this movie. He's a family man at the beginning, until something bad happens. He relies on the justice/the police at first ... but as you can guess while watching the movie, this won't stay that way for long. But that's enough about the story. The ""acting"" is good enough to fit the theme of the movie and you have one of the best endings ever for a movie (imo)! Recommended!",Death Wish
6,classicsoncall,"""What about the old American custom of self defense""?",7,26 October 2016,"It seems the sequels to the original ""Death Wish"" appear with some regularity on cable channels in my area, so I've been catching them out of order every now and then. However it occurred to me I never reviewed the picture that started it all, having seen it when it first came out and not again till the other day.Given the circumstances of how Paul Kersey's wife was murdered and his daughter left a catatonic invalid, the response we get in this story is almost mild by comparison to the over the top violence we see in movies today, including the sequels spawned by this film which started up eight years later. I don't know if this was the revenge film that initiated the genre, though it has a pretty good claim to the title.It's interesting to note the advance in technology from the mid-Seventies to today by way of that scene where Frank Ochoa's (Vincent Gardenia) partner ran around looking for an available phone booth to call Kersey's apartment and got frustrated to find one where the line had been cut. I'm curious how younger viewers of today process that scene, when even a kid can make a call on a cell phone. How primitive the Seventies must have been. In case you didn't keep count, Paul Kersey gunned down a total of ten muggers in the picture, missing one and getting shot himself on his final outing. By then it wasn't a surprise that Ochoa would offer him a way out of the headlines if he accepted a deal to get out of town. However there was an element of closure lacking regarding the three hoods who opened the picture with the attack on Kersey's family; he never ran across them to get the vengeance he was seeking. Speaking of which, and I know all actors have to get their start somewhere, but what a way for a young actor like Jeff Goldblum to catch a break by landing a role in his very first picture as a slimy street thug.",Death Wish
7,gavin6942,Greatest Action Revenge Film Ever?,8,14 December 2012,"A New York City architect (Charles Bronson) becomes a one-man vigilante squad after his wife (Hope Lange) is murdered by street punks in which he randomly goes out and kills would-be muggers on the mean streets after dark.Not only is this the film debut of both Jeff Goldblum and Denzel Washington, it is possibly the greatest revenge film of all time. A mild-mannered veteran -- now working as an architect of all things -- going ballistic? Awesome! I have no idea why I waited so long to see this movie... it kicks all kinds of butt, and presents a very interesting amoral picture. Not immoral, but amoral. Do you cheer him on or hope he gets caught? It is a timeless dilemma.",Death Wish
8,jboothmillard,Death Wish,5,6 March 2010,"From director Michael Winner, this is apparently the film that finally made the lead actor a star in America, I suppose I can see why. Basically Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson) is an architect and Korean War veteran living in New York, and is angered by the murder of his wife Joanna (Hope Lange) and rape of his daughter Carol Toby (Kathleen Tolan) by a gang of muggers (led by Jeff Goldblum in his film debut). His boss decides he needs to get out of New York and go to Arizona to meet a client, who turns out to be a gun enthusiast, and gives him one. Paul takes the gun back with him, and when a mugger tries to hit him, he shoots and kills him. This becomes a habit as Paul goes on a killing spree against all muggers, and while the police led by Detective Frank Ochoa (Vincent Gardenia) is investigating, the public are thankful that someone is standing up to the criminals. Also starring Steven Keats as Jack Toby, William Redfield as Sam Kreutzer, Stuart Margolin as Ames Jainchill, Stephen Elliott as Police Commissioner, Jack Wallace as Hank, Fred J. Scollay as District Attorney, Robert Kya-Hill as Joe Charles and Christopher Guest as Patrolman Jackson Reilly. Bronson is alright in the lead, it is kind of shame he doesn't find the muggers that made him go vigilante, but then again the film isn't the most exciting thing anyway, but it's a crime thriller you could try. Worth watching!",Death Wish
9,Woodyanders,The first and still the best,9,6 February 2019,"Mild-mannered liberal architect Paul Kersey (a strong and credible performance by Charles Bronson) decides to become a vigilante and clean up the mean streets of New York City after his wife and daughter are brutally attacked by low-life hoodlums.Director Michael Winner relates the gripping story at a steady pace, ably crafts a harsh gritty tone, offers a nightmarish presentation of New York City as a dark, dirty, and dangerous urban jungle, and stages the action scenes with considerable skill and precision. The intelligent script by Wendell Mayes depicts a plausibly gradual transformation of Kersey from passive and complacent toe-the-line citizen to more bold and assertive take-charge avenger, with Kersey even vomiting after killing his first mugger. Moreover, having Kersey avoid getting arrested by the police due to big city politics and a favorable reception by the disgruntled public rates as an especially inspired and interesting plot development.Bronson does an expert job of making Kersey a sympathetic everyman sort who's super easy to root for; he receives sturdy support from Hope Lange as Kersey's doomed wife Joanna, Vincent Gardenia as dogged detective Frank Ochoa, Steven Keats as annoying twerp son-in-law Jack Toby, William Redfield as hard-nosed colleague Sam Kreutzer, and Stuart Margolin as happy-go-lucky cowboy gun fanatic Aimes Jainchill. Popping up in nifty small roles are Jeff Goldblum in his memorably slimy film debut as Freak #1, Art J. Evans, Paul Dooley, Christopher Guest, and Olympia Dukakis as cops, and Robert Miano, Eric Laneuville, Robert Herzfeld, and Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs as muggers. Kudos are also in order for Herbie Hancock's funky score and Arthur J. Ornitz's sharp cinematography. Although crude and manipulative for sure, this film nonetheless plays on certain raw emotions in a way that's remarkably potent and resonant.",Death Wish
10,ccthemovieman-1,Classic Remedy For Instant Satisfaction,9,22 April 2006,"I guess by now you could call this movie a ""classic."" It would meet most definitions. It was so popular that it spawned a number of sequels, but they just got dumb and dumber. This is one of the most famous ""revenge"" movies ever made and still stands up today.This was a very, very simple story and it panders to our base instincts which is probably why it was so successful. Most people want justice, and they want it now....which is what this movie preaches. At the time, the movie was shocking. If it came out today, it wouldn't have nearly the impact. However, the early scene of the mother and daughter raped and killed is still horrifying. That will never change.The story then slows down as we see the transformation of the husband, from conscientious objector to vigilante. When Charles Bronson hits the streets, the film picks up big-time. The movie also ends on a very satisfying note.",Death Wish
11,Tweekums,The classic vigilante movie,8,31 March 2018,"As this film opens architect Paul Kersey is enjoying an idyllic holiday in Hawaii with his wife but it isn't long before they return home to New York. As Paul talks to a colleague about the horrific crime rate it becomes apparent that he is considered a 'bleeding heart liberal'... that all changes when three street punks follow his wife and daughter back from the supermarket. His wife doesn't survive the assault that follows and his daughter is traumatised. The police offer little hope that the culprits will be caught. Shortly afterwards Paul travels to Arizona on work; while there he watches a Wild West show which depicts citizens fighting back against those who threaten the peace. He is also taken to a shooting range by his local host; when he returns home he is given a present... a .32"" calibre revolver. Soon after his return he is confronted by a mugger and shoots him dead. It isn't long before he is deliberately putting himself in dangerous situations to draw out muggers. As news of 'The Vigilante' breaks the mugging rate drops dramatically.While I'm sure there were previous films about vigilantes this is the classic that made the genre popular. It is not exactly comfortable viewing; the assault on Paul's wife and daughter is particularly hard to watch. The politics of the film may trouble some viewers with its suggestion that Paul Kersey is a hero because of what he does. Of course one must recall it was made at a time when crime was a much bigger problem in the City of New York and these days news stories about 'guns in America' suggest attitudes towards firearms appear to be changing.Trying to ignore the politics this is a good story where it is easy to sympathise with our protagonist's actions even if one doesn't agree with them. Charles Bronson is on great form as Paul Kersey, one of his most famous roles. Director Michael Winner does a good job creating a menacing feel to the mean streets of New York even if it goes seem conveniently empty at times. I like the fact that even though the film is fairly short the story isn't rushed; Dersey doesn't immediately acquire a pistol but gradually sees that he needs to take action before being given a gun. Overall I'd say this won't be for everybody but it is a must see for fans of the genre.",Death Wish
12,ma-cortes,Successful crime thriller that created the Vigilante genre with Bronson as the main star,6,6 April 2010,"Architect Paul Kersey turned vigilante and taking the law into his own hands as judge , jury and executioner. This first entry with excessive violence concerns about Paul Kersey, a middle-age New York architect and become into vigilante. He lives in N.Y. along with his wife and daughter. Kersey turns the one-man vigilante when his family is attacked by furious band formed by some ominous punks , as his wife is murdered and daughter reduced to living vegetable. Then he stalks the slums of N.Y. and takes the law into his own hands, searching vengeance on crooks, hoodlums, muggers, pimps making the neighborhood safer and bumping off delinquents and street scum.This first outing from the novel ¨Death wish¨ by Brian Garfield contains suspense, noisy action-packed, intrigue, thrills and lots of violence.Bronson with his usual stoic acting displays efficiently his weapon such as ¨Harry the Dirty¨ and killing mercilessly nasties .It's certainly thrilling , though the morality may be questionable , even in this time, as the spectators were clearly on the Kersey-Bronson's side . Furthermore, appears a nice secondary cast , as Vincent Gardenia as obstinate cop, Jeff Goldblum as heinous hoodlum in his film debut, Steven Keats as son-in-law and Hope Lange as wife submitted to brutal rape. It packs a screeching musical score composed, orchestrated and performed by Herbie Hancock. Followed by various extremely violent sequels to this successful 1974 movie, that's , of course,the best from the series. This big hit motion picture is middling directed by Michael Winner such as the successive films with his main star, Charles Bronson. In the mid-70 Winner had great commercial hit , a box office success he repeated when badly in need of another hit smash with the sequel, but both, Bronson and Winner, looked increasingly passionless and mechanical in the later years of their partnership. The worst sequels in which Kersey goes on to torture robbers, all of them inferior and the violence could be deemed excessive, are the following : ¨Death wish II¨ by Michael Winner with Jill Ireland and Vincent Gardenia, ¨Death wish III¨ by Winner with Ed Lauter and Deborah Raffin, ¨Death Wish 4 : The crackdown¨(1987) with Kay Lenz directed by J.Lee Thompson and ¨Death Wish: The face of death¨(1994) with Leslie Anne Down directed by Allan Goldstein.",Death Wish
13,BA_Harrison,"Blam! Blam! Blam! Take that, scumbags.",9,19 June 2018,"Crime in New York is rampant, the city teeming with switchblade-wielding, gun-toting thugs. Innocent people aren't even safe in their homes. After his wife is fatally beaten and daughter sexually assaulted in his apartment, architect Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson) packs his .32 and goes looking for trouble, determined to wipe the scum off the streets.Michael Winner's cathartic revenge drama delivers vicarious thrills for anyone who has ever felt outraged yet helpless about crime and disorder. In reality, vigilantism is, of course, a bad idea (as is the right to bear arms, in my opinion), but when Paul Kersey decides to fight back against the rising tide of crime, one can't help but feel a sense of empowerment, making the film a whole lot of fun for armchair avengers such as myself.Winner handles the action matter of factly, with little sense of style, but Bronson's powerful performance ensures that the film is thoroughly engrossing throughout. So successful was the film at resonating with its audience that it spawned four sequels and, just recently, was remade by Eli Roth with Bruce Willis taking on the Bronson role.8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for an early appearance from Jeff Goldblum as one of the loathsome hoodlums who attack Kersey's family.",Death Wish
14,moonspinner55,"Undeniably potent, but vicious, ugly, lacerating",5,13 September 2003,"Mild-mannered architect Charles Bronson becomes a street vigilante in New York City after his wife and daughter are attacked in their apartment. The fact that Bronson's Paul Kersey never catches up with the thugs who attacked his family can be construed as either clever or misbegotten by the filmmakers (clever because it shows they weren't calculating, misbegotten because it might have provided the viewer with some closure). However, director Michael Winner was smart enough to throw in a little sarcastic wit via detective Vincent Gardenia, who is terrific. Still, it's a bastardization of the source novel, which tried to say that violence is by no means an answer to--or justification of--violent behavior. ** from ****",Death Wish
15,paul_haakonsen,Not all that it is cranked up to be...,4,10 June 2018,"I do remember watching ""Death Wish"" back in my childhood in the 1980s, and remembering that Charles Bronson seemed to be a cool guy in the movie. Then I got a chance to revisit the franchise many, many years later and of course I did sit down to watch the movies again.I have to honestly state that this is a very slow paced movie. ""Death Wish"" is based on a very good concept though, and it had lots of potential for taking the character Paul Kersey and evolve on him. And I said it had potential to do so, but it failed to do so.The blood in the ""Death Wish"" movie was painstakingly and obviously just brightly colored paint, as it looked so fake it would even make a blind person go ""wait a minute!""It had a very predictable storyline, and you knew the outcome of the movie from the very beginning, which was a shame because director and writer Michael Winner didn't offer much to challenge the intellect of the audience.It was fun to see a young Jeff Goldblum as a hoodlum in this movie.Why this movie spawned a 2018 remake is beyond me, because it is adequate enough as it was.",Death Wish
16,Quinoa1984,perhaps the 'proverbial good vigilante drama' of its time,9,5 August 2005,"Before I saw Death Wish, I knew there was more than just the context of it being a starring vehicle for one of the major bad-asses of the action picture, Charles Bronson (who's best role is still the one with the least words, Once Upon a Time in the West), and that it contains the elements that would spark an entire sub-genre (for better or worse). I knew that there was also a kind of historical context for the times, of how it was in New York City as well as in others during the 70's (though especially in the 70's)- I remembered my mother telling me about how the atmosphere of 'Death Wish' with its thieves and rapists and abusers was for real, that they were around every corner, and that crime was indeed at an all-time high then. So watching the film with this in mind, it brings a little extra drama to the story of Paul Kersey (Bronson). There is the style, and underlying humor, that appeals for the genre fans (and there is a minor bit of exploitation in making Kersey a 'bleeding heart liberal' with skill behind a gun). But there is also a sense of overall tragedy to it all.The tragedy comes out of a truly disturbing scene- Kersey's wife and daughter go home from the market, unaware that a trio of hoodlums (one of them a fresh-faced Jeff Goldblum no less) follow them, bust in, and beat and rape them. This is indeed so terrifying and real it tops a scene like the one in Clockwork Orange with the assault on the writer; it's somehow even more shocking when its in an apartment in the now, with hoodlums as random and sadistic as the ones here. Kersey mourns the loss of his wife and daughter (the latter to dementia) briefly, but it sticks with him through the whole film, in one way or another. The first signs of him knowing what's around him on the streets at night (and one of the funnier bits of the film's bleakness) is when he takes a sock full of quarters to use on the hoodlums. This is short-lived after a visit to the south-west, where he gets slipped a gun in his suitcase. The rest of the film unfolds as it would, at least under the circumstances of the genre.Yet within the grip of Death Wish being a genre picture (and this is something that the sequels and other lessor B films have forgotten) is that there has to be a sense of reality, and real dangers, to the film, not to mention the sort of evolution of Kersey into how he becomes- a killer, a vigilante of the scum who try to rob and threaten to kill. Although the police procedural that parallels his story isn't as strong as his, it works fine within the scope of the story that has to turn out in a certain way. But there are other factors to go with it besides a strong story (based on an even stronger book Brian Garfield). Bronson is, indeed, great at being, well, Bronson. If the violence in the film doesn't pull any punches for its time period, Bronson doesn't skip being good at showing Kersey's inner strength of defense as well as his weaker side. It's not a very complex performance aside from the conflicts midway through the film with Kersey, but it's in a way truer than the film could deserve. Michael Winner, the director, is also an asset with this, in giving to the film its gritty tone. And, as an added bonus, there's the sweet musical score from Herbie Hancock.Death Wish is a film of its time, but one that still has significance, and entertainment value for today. People my age (i.e. college kids) will be attracted to it for its 'retro' style, and, as it is in the vein of a film like Taxi Driver (though less visceral), as a stylistic action film. And for the older folks, the drama of the film, and the solid storytelling, will keep it interesting. In short, it's the proverbial good vigilante film of its time, giving Bronson one of his most memorable turns.",Death Wish
17,edwagreen,Death Wish: He Cut the Recidivism Rate ****,10,30 May 2011,"John V. Lindsay, the late mayor of New York City, called our metropolis Fun City. Some fun. The muggers ran wild during Lindsay's term and this is best reflected in this Charles Bronson one man show in 1974.Amazing that Hope Lange took such a small part. Her murder and the putting of their daughter in a catatonic state set the stage for our hero to become a one-man vigilante death squad. He dispenses justice quickly and without a second thought.Bronson was absolutely terrific in the part. It was made to order for him. He was equally matched by a police chief, played with relish by Vincent Gardenia. He knew what type of person he was looking for once the shootings started.The ending shows us that the Bronson character had a fever in the blood. No matter where he was, his one way to fight crime would go on.",Death Wish
18,BandSAboutMovies,A classic,10,4 November 2018,"New York City in 1974 must have felt like the end of the world. Based on the 1972 novel by Brian Garfield, Death Wish was the answer. In fact, in many theaters, the audience stood up and cheered as Paul Kersey got his bloody revenge for the crims visited upon him and his family.The film we're about to discuss went through many twists and turns as it made its way to the screen. Originally, it ended with the vigilante hero confronting the thugs who attacked his family and them killing him, police detective Ochoa discovering his weapon and deciding to follow in his footsteps. And get this - the first choice to play the lead was Jack Lemmon, with Henry Fonda as Ochoa and Sidney Lumet directing.Finally, United Artists picked the gritty action veteran Michael Winner to direct. Several studios rejected the film due to its subject matter and the difficulty of casting the lead. Winner wanted Bronson, who he'd worked with in the past, but the actor's agent hated the message of the film and Bronson felt that the book was about a weak man, someone he would not be playing on film.Death Wish turned Bronson, who was 53 at the time of its release, into a major star known worldwide. It's a movie made exactly for its time. Despite its lurid subject matter and dangerous acceptance of its hero's actions, it's still a great exploitation film that actually explores the why behind its hero's actions instead of just setting him loose upon people.Paul Kersey (Bronson) starts the movie in Hawaii with his wife Joanna. When they return home to the squalid streets of New York City, it's only days before three thugs - including Jeff Goldblum! - invade their apartment, raping their daughter Carol and bearing Joanna so badly that she dies. Beyond Goldblum in this early role, keep an eye open for Christopher Guest and Olympia Dukakis as cops, as well as Sonia Manzano (Maria from Sesame Street, who was dating director Winner at the time and suggested that Herbie Hancock do the score) and Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs (Freddie ""Boom Boom"" Washington from TV's Welcome Back, Kotter) in supporting roles.As he recovers from his wife's death, Paul is mugged. He fights back and chases off his attacker and finds new strength from the battle. An architect by trade, Paul heads to Tucson where he helps Ames Jainchill with his residential development project. After work one night, he goes to a gun club with Ames, where we learn how good of a shot Paul is. Turns out he was a conscientious objector and combat medic who was taught marksmanship by his father, but promised his mother he'd never pick up another gun after his dad was killed in a hunting accident. On the way back home, Paul discovers that Ames has given him a gun as a gift.Now back home, Paul learns from his son-in-law that his daughter is still catatonic and would be better off in a mental hospital. That night, when walking, Paul is mugged again but he has the gun with him. He fights back and kills the mugger, but even that action causes him to grow physically sick. But soon, he's prowling the mean streets and looking for a fight.Before long, NYPD detective Lt. Frank Ochoa (Vincent Gardenia) begins investigating the vigilante killings and quickly narrows down his suspect list to Paul. As the manhunt gets closer and closer, Paul finally is caught after passing out from blood loss after a shootout. Instead of arresting him, the NYPD wants the case quietly solved, so they send him off to Chicago. The minute he arrives, he helps a woman who was almost mugged and stares at the criminals with a smile, his fingers in the shape of a gun.There's a story which may be apocryphal, but when Michael Winner told Bronson what this film would be about - a man who goes out and shoots muggers - Bronson replied, ""I'd like to do that."" Winner said, ""The film?"" And Bronson replied, ""No. Shoot muggers.""After viewing the film, author Brian Garfield hated how the film advocated vigilantism, so he wrote a sequel called Death Sentence that was made into a movie in 2007 starring Kevin Bacon. No word on whether or not he hated that movie too, as it only keeps a little of the book.Compared to the heights of mayhem that this series will descend to, this is a retrained meditation of a man facing an increasingly violent world. Stay tuned. Paul Kersey is just getting started.",Death Wish
19,Coventry,Paul Kersey: Architect & Arse-Kicker!,8,30 December 2007,"""Death Wish"" has always been one of the easiest movie-targets for critics to bash, because it's overly violent, gratuitously explicit and  supposedly - the whole movie is nothing more than a promotional campaign to encourage more people to buy a gun and protect their loved ones and personal belongings. Perhaps the violence & bloodshed form the most memorable parts of this film, but the screenplay and character drawings are far more complex than it superficially seems. Not talking about any of the sequels here, but the original ""Death Wish"" is as much a dramatic portrait of a torn man as it is a harsh & relentless vigilante thriller. The main character, Paul Kersey, is not just a randomly trigger-happy gunman. Heck, he doesn't even become a wild bloodthirsty animal immediately after a trio of thugs murdered his beloved wife and abused his daughter so badly she turns into a silent & traumatized vegetable. The story introduces Paul Kersey as a warm-hearted and reasonable man who acknowledges society's issues and even tends to defend the underprivileged people, unlike his fellow colleagues. The tragedy that overcomes his family literally tears him up inside and, after a professional trip to Arizona where he re-discovers his bounding with guns, Paul dwells the New York streets to cleanse them from all the scum. ""Death Wish"" is, as surprising as it may sound, much more realistic then most revenge-thrillers. Kersey doesn't just exclusively go after the thugs that harmed his own happiness, as that would be impossible. Neither does he rescue defenseless old ladies when their purses are being snatched, nor does he provoke burglar attacks. He simply takes on every criminal who crosses his path. Naturally this spawns a large-scaled police investigation as well as a lot of variable media attention. Particularly great about ""Death Wish"" is the sense of filming location. The dark, narrow alleys and the gritty, forsaken parks of New York feel effectively menacing and ominous. Director Michael Winner's views are clearly a bit conservative in some ways, but he has a strong feeling for atmosphere and suspense and he obviously knows Charles Bronson inside & out. Winner, who previously made three films with the veteran actor already (including ""The Mechanic""), allows Bronson to act like he prefers: silent, but charismatic with very little dialogs but a lot of tough and emotional grimaces. The violence is remarkable and often downright malevolent, but imaginably realistic and confronting. The sequences showing the assault of Kersey's wife and daughter (starring a youthful Jeff Goldblum in his very first film role ever) are deeply unpleasant and disturbing to behold. A period masterpiece, but still shocking today.",Death Wish

21,hitchcockthelegend,You will have to take it.,9,3 August 2008,"Death Wish is a 1974 film based on the 1972 novel written by Brian Garfield. The film is directed by Michael Winner and stars Charles Bronson as Paul Kersey. Kersey becomes a vigilante after his wife is murdered and his daughter is sexually assaulted during a break in at the family home.Few films in the 70s have the reputation that is afforded Michael Winner's Death Wish, it seems that if you like the film then you must be an advocate of fascist exploitation cinema, or if you don't like it then you are a bleeding heart liberal. Critics of the time positively hated the picture, calling it irresponsible for advocating vigilantism, apparently it's a dirty picture calling on unlimited punishment to the criminals who stalk the cities across the globe. What the critics of the time failed to see, as the film became a huge commercial success, was that as they sat in their comfy secure high rise apartments, the people of the streets lived in fear of stepping outside their homes.Crime was rife in the 70s, more so in America where the film particularly struck a chord with those uneasy with the ever growing threat of violent crime out on the streets. But did Winner and Bronson purely make a film for the working class people of the city? It's positively churlish to decry the influence and impact of Death Wish back in the early 70s, and I would wager that it was churlish of those critics to not embrace the film as the critical piece of aware cinema that it was, and, still is. Nothing in Death Wish is violence for violence sake, it's all relevant in capturing the time frame that was awash with fear, and sadly here, 35 years on, it's as relevant as it has ever been. If you are a fan or not, rate or hate, Death Wish is a landmark in cinema history, it's an urban nightmare as an everyman working Joe takes up arms and fights back against the slime that would take all that we hold dear, purely because they don't have it themselves.Outside of the moral questions that Death Wish throws up, the film contains a searingly brilliant turn from Charles Bronson as Kersey, a sedate hard working man reduced to being vigilante on account of a society that can't protect the honest. Anyone in doubt of Bronson's leading man status need look no further than the opening frame here as Kersey photographs his wife on a beach, keep that in mind, as later we witness him swinging a sock full of quarters in his apartment, the transformation is incredible, that could well be you or I, a wonderful turn from Bronson that has been sadly lost amidst the controversy surrounding the film. Also of note is Vincent Gardenia's performance as Detective Frank Ochoa, grizzled and as tough as they come, it's a wonderful character portrayal that is taking on poignant importance the further the film progresses.Death Wish is far from being one of the best films in the 70s, in fact technically, it's close to being average, but if a list of the most important 70s movies doesn't include Death Wish? Well they have obviously missed the point, and crucially, the time frame. 9/10",Death Wish
22,preppy-3,"Good, solid thriller",7,7 March 2003,"Charles Bronson plays a liberal, mild-mannered architect. His wife (Hope Lange) is murdered and his daughter is gang-raped into a near-comatose state by a gang of thugs (one played by then unknown Jeff Goldblum!). He slowly becomes a vigilante--going out late at night and shooting and killing any muggers and thieves that attack him. Somewhat unrealistically he's attacked every single night he goes out--was NY THAT bad in 1974? He becomes a media hero and police detective Vincent Gardenia is assigned to stop him.Interesting movie--on one hand you're all for Bronson and, on the other, you're disgusted with what he's doing. Both sides of the issue are presented but not dealt with in much depth--this IS a Charles Bronson movie after all! Film is dated (NY has gotten much safer since this came out) but is still powerful.Bronson gives a bad performance which somewhat diminishes the films impact, but everybody else is great--especially Lange and Gardenia. And look for Olympia Dukakis and Christopher Guest (very young and handsome) in small roles.Only complaint--the murder/rape--it's way too graphic and disturbing. It's hard to watch today--I can only imagine the impact in 1974.Avoid the sequels--they're all violent killings and nothing else. All the moral issues brought up in this movie are gone.",Death Wish
23,poolandrews,Decent vigilante film.,5,27 February 2010,"Death Wish is set in New York City where Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson) lives & works as an architect, while at work three thugs break into his apartment & beat his wife Joanna (Hope Lange) up & gang rape his daughter Carol (Kathleen Tolan). Joanna & Carol are taken to hospital where Joanna dies from her injuries, unable to cope with the ordeal Carol has an emotional breakdown & ends up being committed. Paul contacts the police but there is little chance of find those responsible, with crime rates through he roof & innocent decent people fearing to go out at night Paul decides he has had enough & starts to fight back. Armed with a pistol he walks the New York City streets at night looking for the muggers & criminals, when he comes across anyone he feels is breaking the law he dishes out his own brand of justice as he shoots the criminals dead. Crime rates falls & people feel safer on the streets but the police begin to close in on Paul...Co-produced & directed by Michael Winner this vigilante thriller was based on the novel by Brian Garfield & is a pretty good film that plays very much on the fears of the period, to be fair it still has relevance now I suppose even after 35 odd years since it was made. At the time crime rates were spiralling & the average person must have been worried about this & as such I would imagine Death Wish hit home, I'm sure the idea of a lone vigilante who works beyond the seemingly ineffectual law dishing out his own brand of lethal justice must have appealed to audiences back then. Of course Death Wish is a rather heavy handed film as it quotes crime statics, champions gun laws & show's the brutal attacking & raping of a mother & daughter so maybe it's not a film for everyone. There's also a political angle as the authorities decide that arresting the vigilante wouldn't be good & it's engineered so Kersey is scared off. Kersey is the sort of anti-hero action film character that are seen regularly today but back then the play by his own rules hero was a new thing, together with Clint Eastwood Dirty Harry (1971) the character of Paul Kersey here probably helped developed the modern action film hero. The film drags at times, Kersey's trip to Tuscon seems a little unnecessary expect for some broad wild west allusions as it compares 70's America to the old frontier & it's type of law & justice. I would have liked it better if they had cut the Tuscon sequence & just showed Kersy visiting his daughter at regular intervals to remind him & us why he was turning vigilante, unfortunately his daughter is totally forgotten about by the half way mark. It has a certain power & the helplessness some feel when it comes to crime & the inadequacies of the law is easy to relate too even now but as a film in it's own right it's a bit of a drag as it gets buried under various heavy handed ideas & themes that come & go & it's a bit repetitive as well.It seems that every person Kersy meets at night in New York City is a thug & mugger. There's not much violence expect for the opening attack in which a woman is beaten & a her daughter raped in a rather unpleasant scene. Apparently the producer & Paramount wanted to call the film Sidewalk Vigilante which when compared to the title Death Wish just sucks. &0's New York is a great setting for a film such as this, the sleaziness & dirtiness of it perfectly captures the urban decay & moral decline that the film is about.With a supposed budget of about $3,000,000 this has good solid production values although some of the 70's fashions & decor do date it. The acting is OK< Bronson was never a great actor although he has some good support here including Jeff Goldblum in his feature film debut. Frank Sinatra, Steve McQueen, Jack Lemmon & Clint Eastwood were all apparently either attached to star or offered the role of Paul Kersey.Death Wish is a decent vigilante film that has a social message & it still has relevance today although it's all rather heavy handed & does get bogged down within itself at times. Nt a perfect film but by no means a bad one either. Followed by four sequels, Death Wish II (1982), Death Wish 3 (1985), Death Wish 4: The Crackdown (1987) & Death Wish V: The Face of Death (1990) while the IMDb lists a Death Wish (2011) remake as in development.",Death Wish

This is the way anyone who has experienced personal loss would probably act given the same circumstances. We want to lash out at those who are scum and prey upon us and others. Maybe we just limit ourselves to reading the obits every day and hoping to see a name, but Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson) took the step that we all have wished at one time or another that we had the guts to take.Being a liberal, opposed to the death penalty, that is hard to say, but it is true. The need for revenge must be ingrained. Why else would we watch this and the four sequels as well as other revenge movies like Death Sentence or The Brave One. In fact, I know one critic that categorizes all movies into love stories or revenge movies. Interesting observation.Bronson was made by this role, turned down by Frank Sinatra.

25,zardoz-13,The Classic Vigilante Revenge Thriller,9,5 April 2012,"Charles Bronson attained stardom before he turned vigilante in British director Michael Winner's ""Death Wish,"" a violent revenge thriller that looks tame by today's standards since Paramount released this R-rated movie in 1974. Indeed, ""Death Wish"" turned Bronson into a superstar, and ""The Dirty Dozen"" star went on to make four other films. Winner stuck with the franchise until the fifth outing when J. Lee Thompson took over the helm. As incredibly violent as ""Death Wish"" is, this gritty Big Apple melodrama casts Bronson against the grain. He plays architect Paul Kersey who was a conscientious objector in Korea. Essentially, he is a non-violent individual who survives the murder of his wife and the rape of his daughter during a bad day in New York City. ""Death Wish"" had its detractors, and they howled in agony about the graphic violence. The worst of the mayhem occurs for only a few minutes when the mother and daughter are brutally assaulted in our hero's apartment. For the record, the three psychos are white, and one is Jewish. The rest of the psychos that Paul Kersey kills vary by race, color, etc. The Wendell Mayes screenplay deals the attitudes about violence. Who has the right to kill? Our hero goes from paradise to New York and then out West where men solved their own problems with any intervening. The film also makes clear that we have become so civilized that he cannot handle violence much less use it. Herbie Hancock's stupendous score gives ""Death Wish"" an added vibrancy that an ordinary score would not have furnished.",Death Wish
26,Boba_Fett1138,Everyone has a little Paul Kersey in them.,7,26 June 2006,"Would the world be a better place with more persons like Paul Kersey around? Who knows. But either way, everyone should be able to recognize themselves in the actions Paul Kersey takes. Even though its ruthless and violent, you still understand him and cheer for him as well. It distinct this movie from other 'revenge-flicks' and is the very reason why this movie has grown a bit into a Charles Bronson classic.I like how the movie handles its story. It doesn't try to glorify Paul Kersey's actions but it does make them understandable. Yes, the violence is pretty brutal but it all serves a purpose in the movie and becomes necessary for the forming of the character. Basically this movie is just your average action movie revenge flick but with more realism added to it. It helps to make ""Death Wish"" an original movie, even though the story and concept itself is far from anything new or original. The story is slowly told and it takes its time to develop. The movie is perhaps even an essential '70's viewing, since its a one of a kind movie, in which a normal every day guy turn into a 'sidewalk vigilante' after his wife is killed and his daughter raped by a couple of thugs (one of them played by a very young Jeff Goldblum in his very first screen appearance).But lets be fair. the movie is far from a perfect one. The movie has a typical experimental like '70's style, especially in its cinematography, that is interesting to watch but it adds very little and works distracting at times. The movie is also told very simple at times and some of the sequences even feel amateur like, to be honest. The story itself also feels extremely far fetched and unlikely. I mean, literally every time Paul Kersey goes outside he walks into trouble. He gets mugged several times and he encounters other thugs on numerous occasions. It's highly unlikely all, even for in a city like New York.The acting on the other hand is good. It's probably mainly thanks to Charles Bronson that his character works so well for the story. I also really liked Vincent Gardenia in his role. He brought some much needed comic relief and gave the story some extra flair and depth.A simple movie that mainly thanks to the original way it handles the story and characters, works out extremely well as a brutal action flick. Even though flawed, still an essential '70's viewing in my opinion.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Death Wish
27,view_and_review,Vigilantism Ordinary Joe Style,7,1 October 2018,"1974 New York is rampant with crime and the regular citizens are powerless to stop it. When Paul Kersey's wife is killed by a band of muggers he decides to take matters in his own hands.At its core I liked the movie. Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson) was truly a regular joe. He was an architect at a firm and even though he'd served in the Korean war he was a conscientious objector so he never handled a gun in the war. He wasn't a Rambo or Commando fighting back. He didn't shoot with a kill shot every time or strike with a mortal blow every punch (not that he was fighting anyone). Although a good shot, he was still a novice. I appreciated all of that. The part that got under my skin a bit was an ancillary part of the movie but still prominent. There was an underlying propaganda of: ""more guns means more safety."" It was really driven home when the Arizonian sniped at the city of New York being a cesspool of crime whereas Arizona was not. His reason: they allow guns in Arizona. As if guns are a panacea for all problems.

He comes to the conclusion that this was a good thing, and there is no reason why it shouldn't happen again...Michael Winner comes in for a lot of criticism as a director: in this case, he and frequent colleague Charles Bronson have made a film which, while superficially a simple revenge thriller, goes beyond that in addressing causes of and consequences of vigilantism without coming to any glib conclusions, and does so in a way which has the audience rooting for Kersey's damaged protagonist - contemporary audiences were cheering in cinemas.And Bronson, customarily so impassive, is very good here.",Death Wish
29,AlsExGal,Charles Bronson was born to play this role!,10,3 November 2019,"And I am giving this film a 10/10 not so much for being good cinema, but for being a great snapshot in time of where urban America was concerning crime and punishment in the mid 1970s. It resonated with so many people, and just as a film in general, I would say this is a 7.5/10.Bronson plays a New York City architect, Paul Kersey. One night when he is away from home and his wife and grown daughter are home alone, a gang of criminals get into the apartment by posing as grocery store deliverymen and murder his wife and gang rape his daughter. The daughter is left in a catatonic state. Paul travels to Tucson for a job, and while there, he sees some mock western shoot-outs staged for entertainment and he begins to consider the value of the old ""code of the west"". Then he goes home to New York with a brand new revolver that is a gift from a client.So he decides to go out at night and bait traps for criminals with himself, armed with the revolver. The first time he is mugged and shoots he only shoots the criminal once in the stomach. The guy saw him. If he lives he could be ID'd, but Paul is so traumatized by doing violence to a total stranger that he just runs home and becomes ill. But you know, just like violence escalates in the criminal population because it becomes easier as you repeat the act and become desensitized to it, so Paul becomes desensitized to shooting criminals. He begins to take on two and three at a time, making sure they are shot dead before he dispassionately walks off.So the police are tasked to get this vigilante - after the first four or five bodies of criminals they figure that is what is going on. And in walks Vincent Gardenia as inspector Frank Ochoa of the NYPD. The police are putting way more manpower into finding the vigilante than they ever did or would to find the murderers/rapists who ruined Paul Kersey's life. But two interesting things are happening as the spree continues. First, muggings and violent crime in general are way down. Second, the citizenry are admiring and starting to imitate this vigilante to some degree. They are fighting back with hatpins, whatever they can find.Now Ochoa has the blood of an investigator in him, but he also realizes that this vigilante is making his job and that of the police much easier and the city safer. So what happens? Watch and find out.This film was a great study of what happens when urban environments inevitably divide into two camps - the civilized who abhor violence of any kind, and the criminals who prey on them. What happens when these two groups inevitably interact and the police only seem to be able to document the crimes, but can't stop them in any reliable way. Bronson says so much with his expressions and his walk - he has little dialogue here. It's when Death Wish became a franchise that it became a parody of itself.

And as the body count rises so does the pressure. At any rate, I thought both Charles Bronson and Vincent Gardenia (as ""Inspector Frank Ochoa"") put in superb performances and the director (Michael Winner) also did a good job setting the stage for such a dark, gloomy and violent film.

Why should people be scared to walk the streets? Yes, he's breaking the law, but aren't all the comic book movie heroes in theory breaking the law?In fact, this has many similarities to the Batman origin story, family are killed, hero protects the city via the night and the shadows, the only difference is that Kersey kills the bad guys.Its sharp, cold and relentless, easily Winners best movie, and although the sequels stretched the boundaries of realism, they don't tarnish this movie, because they are just over the top action movies (but lots of fun).Its a great movie, lots of fun, and it thankfully answers its own morality, would make a great companion piece with Winners Dirty Weekend, which is just this film but with a lady in the lead.",Death Wish

34,Aaron1375,An architect turns vigilante after his wife and daughter are attacked,7,18 June 2014,"I have finally seen this Charles Bronson film from the 70's and I have to say it is pretty good. The problem with this film though is that a lot of the vigilante scenes are the same thing repeated over and over. I can see why the later installments of this franchise got lower scores as they went on as my guess is they all simply rehash the exact same thing for the most part. Here, there are still some interesting elements that are most likely not present in the later movies. Though I cannot see them being too bad, mainly because one still gets to see super tough guy Charles Bronson in action! The story, muggers break into an apartment and kill Paul Kersey's wife and leave his daughter in a near comatose like state. He handles it the best he can; however, he starts to feel a bit of power when he smashes a would be mugger in the face with two rolls of quarters and then during a trip to Texas he fires off a few rounds and ends up getting a gun as a gift for a man he helped down there. He is soon tracking down muggers and gunning them down, leaving the police scrambling to find the vigilante killer; however, even if they apprehend him they may still find themselves with more copycats on their hands.The film is interesting as Paul feels a sense of power when he knocks out a mugger with quarters, but after his first kill he is sick and vomits. Soon, though, he is killing and cannot seem to stop. At the end he even winks and points his finger like a gun at some hooligans in a train station. My guess in the sequels, this transformation is pretty much absent or essentially copied.So, overall a good film, but mainly due to the presence of Charles Bronson. I have seen only a few films of his, but usually he does good in his role even if the movie is not all that great. It was nice to finally see this film as it is one of those vigilante films during this era that was something I wanted to catch. I also want to see that film called, ""The Exterminator"" as I hear that one is pretty good too. This one has kills and a pretty good story so I enjoyed it, it just needed a bit more variety here and there as the kills all do seem the same and also the finale could have been done a bit better as well.",Death Wish
35,Wuchakk,Makes you root for the vigilante,9,28 June 2014,"Although 1974's ""Death Wish"" spawned a bunch of inferior sequels in the 80s, the original film stands out as an excellent drama/thriller about a ""bleeding heart liberal"" man, Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson), who turns to vigilanteism when his wife is murdered and his daughter turned into a vegetable by low-life scum in New York City. As Kersey's ""victims"" pile up, a police commissioner (Stephen Elliott) zeroes-in on Kersey as the vigilante.This is a great film that effectively inspires the viewer to root for Paul Kersey and his cause. Like Kersey in the story, we feel frustrated by the injustice of stoo-pid policies that embolden criminals and leave the citizenry open prey. It's not a mindless action film, but more of a drama/thriller. The characters are established and you care about Kersey, his son-in-law (Steven Keats) and daughter (Kathleen Tolan). The viewer observes and understands Kersey's slow transformation into a one-man judge, jury & executioner.

She dies by the wounds and his daughter being raped doesn't become better so he decide to leave New York to Tucson but there guns are nature and he starts shooting again. The joy brings to mind to take revenge in New York. We are only 20 minutes in this flick, from there on it he becomes a one-man vigilante squad killing scum on the streets. For such revenge kind of flick it's low on blood and gore, Two years later Assault On Precinct 13 (1976) became notorious by shooting a child in the head, Last House On The Left (1972) was also a revenge horror that was avoided due it's brutality.

I mean, the movie was machined as a manifesto on private gun ownership. And that debate still rages today, giving this movie an unusual relevance.

Rugged, steely-eyed and someone I certainly don't want to bump into in a dark alley.But there's also enough story material in his thirst for vengeance without extolling the virtues of vigilantism in big bad New York City.6/10",Death Wish

41,JamesHitchcock,"Asks the right questions, but gives the wrong answers",6,5 March 2010,"The plot of this film is a simple one. After an attack by robbers leaves his wife Joanna dead and his daughter Carol seriously injured, Paul Kersey takes his gun and goes out looking for revenge. That could, of course, be the plot of a Western; there were innumerable Westerns based upon a similar revenge theme, such as ""True Grit"" or ""Hannie Caulder"" to take only two examples from the previous five years. The difference is that Paul Kersey is not living in the Wild West of 1874 but in the New York City of 1974 where he works as an architect. ""Death Wish"" was probably the first film (although far from the last) to take this theme and place it in a modern urban setting. Moreover, Kersey does not just swear vengeance on the three men responsible for the original attack but rather becomes a vigilante waging war on the criminal fraternity as a whole, especially muggers.The film was a highly controversial one when it first came out. The controversy was partly due to the extreme levels of violence depicted, especially during the initial attack on Joanna and Carol. (Joanna is beaten up and then forced to watch her daughter being raped). Such levels of violence were, however, not unprecedented in the cinema of the mid-seventies; Peckinpah's ""Straw Dogs"", for example, which features a similarly violent rape scene, had come out three years earlier.What made ""Death Wish"" especially controversial was that it was widely (and, it must be said, with some justification) interpreted as advocating vigilantism. Comparisons were made (and continue to be made) with another movie from the period which was also criticised for its advocacy of uncompromising methods in the fight against crime, Don Siegel's ""Dirty Harry"". Yet there is, in my view, a difference between the two films. Harry Callahan's strong-arm methods may exceed his legal powers as a police officer, but he only goes beyond those limits when innocent lives are at stake.Paul Kersey, by contrast, is not a police officer but a civilian, and he cold-bloodedly guns down his victims not in order to save the innocent but in order to take revenge. Some at least of his killings might, legally, be justified as self-defence (he never opens fire until his assailants have drawn a gun or a knife on him), but what can be justified legally cannot always be justified morally. Whatever liberals might say, it is possible to find a moral justification for Dirty Harry's behaviour (at least in the original film; some of its sequels, especially ""Sudden Impact"", are more questionable). It would not be so easy to find a moral justification for Paul Kersey.Despite the film's dubious ethical stance (it never condemns Kersey's behaviour), it achieved considerable success, probably because it caught the mood of the public in the seventies. In his review of the film, Roger Ebert argued that the New York shown in the film ""doesn't look like 1974, but like one of those bloody future cities in science-fiction novels about anarchy in the twenty-first century"", but in the 1970s, a period of sharply rising crime, many people really did believe that in America's cities, especially New York, ""every shadow holds a mugger; every subway train harbours a killer; the park is a breeding ground for crime"" (to quote Ebert again). The film's criticisms of the police also struck a chord with the public. The police, exemplified by Lt. Frank Ochoa, the officer leading the hunt for the vigilante, seem not only unable to cope but also uncaring. They seem far more anxious to pursue the vigilante than to catch Joanna's murderers, the reason being that his crimes are a news story, and therefore politically sensitive, whereas her death is a mere statistic. They are also prepared to falsify the crime figures for political reasons and finally, when the have worked out that Kersey is the vigilante, to allow him to go unpunished at the behest of the city's District Attorney.This was the film that was to define the careers of both its director Michael Winner and its star Charles Bronson. Following its success both men, especially Bronson, became increasingly associated with violent action thrillers until it became almost impossible to imagine Bronson in anything else. Perhaps Winner's best-known film before ""Death Wish"" was the Western ""Lawman"", another action-thriller but one which took a more subtle moral position and questioned the ""code of the West"" with its emphasis on honour and revenge. It is perhaps therefore ironic that three years later he was to be responsible for a film which advocated the extension of that code to modern urban America.Bronson is better here than he was in the ""Dirty Harry"" clone ""The Stone Killers"", also directed by Winner, but he has never been my favourite actor and his lack of emotional range handicaps him here. Kersey is, after all, a former pacifist driven to kill by rage and grief, but Bronson's habitual icy demeanour does not suggest a man in the grip of uncontrollable emotions. And yet in many ways this is not a bad film. The action sequences are well handled and Winner brings to the film some surprisingly deft touches. The action takes place in winter and the shots of a bleak, snowbound city, especially during Joanna's funeral, do more to suggest Kersey's inner state of mind than does Bronson's acting. The film does at least ask some tough questions about crime and law and order, even if it ultimately comes to the wrong conclusions. It is a pity that its reputation has been affected by all those inferior sequels. 6/10",Death Wish
42,namashi_1,Charles Bronson lives on....,7,21 October 2009,"Late Legend Charles Bronson is the life, soul and everything of 'Death Wish', he's outstanding throughout.Michael Winner has directed the film with ease, there is a rustic feeling which is needed in a film like this. Agreed, the film's theme is disturbing & gory, but there's a reason behind it and it works on it's favor all the way.The brutal rape scene depresses you completely and that's exactly what the veteran filmmaker wanted. The sequences when Bronson kills the baddies might be violent but they are clap-worthy nonetheless. The film has soul and there's no questioning it's super-success upon it's release way back in 1974.It's a Charles Bronson show all the way. He lives on. Late actors Hope Lange, Vincent Gardenia, Steven Keats & William Redfield deliver first-rate performances. Jeff Goldblum debuted with this film, he's passable as a menace.all n all, 'Death Wish' is a must watch.",Death Wish
43,Red-Barracuda,Controversial 70's crime classic,8,23 August 2017,"In the 1970's the American western died out as a functioning genre. It's settings and stories no longer spoke to audiences in ways that felt relevant enough for them. In its place came the crime movie, which spoke to people about their contemporary fears and took place within the backdrop of the urban towns and cities in which they lived. I don't think it is an accident that there is a sequence in Death Wish where Charles Bronson's character travels to a western settlement and learns there that the lessons of the wild west gunfighter had to be brought back to his crime infested home town of New York City. In fact, you could argue that the star and director of Death Wish, Bronson and Michael Winner, had already made a western two years earlier which tapped into very similar territory - Chato's Land (1972) featured Bronson as a Native American taking extended vengeance against a group of men who had raped his wife and murdered his family. Like another hugely popular 70's crime movie Dirty Harry (1971), Death Wish tapped into a public mood which was fed up of rampant crime and liberal justice. But while Dirty Harry was controversial in its depiction of police brutality, Death Wish was if anything even more so in that it actively supported the idea of citizens going out and killing criminals. Both films are, or course, supremely politically incorrect; and naturally even more entertaining to watch because of this.The story follows a liberal architect from New York whose life and attitudes are turned upside down when his wife is murdered and his daughter raped by a trio of thugs. The police prove inefficient so he arms himself and set about cleaning the streets up of any undesirables he can find. The general public cheer him on and are encouraged to fight back against criminals. The crime epidemic that New York suffered back in those days is a cause of the popularity of this movie and of the cycle of vigilante films in general. Bronson even began to be typecast in this specific bracket of violent crime fayre. But this must surely be the best of the sub-genre. It doesn't pull its punches with a very disturbing house invasion sequence which makes for grim viewing. Interestingly, the criminals involved in this are neither caught nor ever seen again. I highly suspect that if such a movie were made today they would be made to be shown getting their just deserts but it is to Death Wish's credit that it does not choose to play things so easily with the audience and indicates that sometimes those who commit atrocious acts get off scot-free. Bronson's character is then shown to me more clearly at war with the whole criminal underbelly as opposed to be out specifically seeking revenge. The night-time scenes of him wandering the streets encountering all manner of violent criminals are both sinister and almost slightly surreal (after all there does seem to be brutal thugs around every corner of this city!). These sequences are well shot and the city of New York is a major character in this movie, it really truly had mean streets in those days.This grim, controversial film remains a thrilling watch partially because it is a well-paced and very direct crime-thriller but also because it is the kind of thing we just don't see very much of these days any more. Films actively encouraging vigilante violence and homicide are seen as being out-of-order now. Some people tend to quite easily forget that the movies are intended for thrills and not actually text books in how to live your life.",Death Wish

46,sddavis63,Charles Bronson's Signature Role,5,20 March 2011,"This is the movie that made Charles Bronson a real star, and Paul Kersey undoubtedly is the one and only character that he's going to be remembered for into the distant future. That doesn't, of course, mean that Charles Bronson is an especially good actor, but it does mean that he had a signature role. ""Death Wish"" fits in with the general theme of a lot of movies made around the same time. ""Network"" (1976) was a biting caricature of television and the dumbing down of society; ""Rocky"" (1976) celebrated the underdog at a time when the underdogs felt crushed; ""Death Wish"" - made a couple of years earlier - is the feel good movie for those who are (if I might steal a line from Network"") ""mad as hell and ... won't take it anymore."" Those are three very different movies from the same era, all seeming to deal with roughly the same issues. ""Death Wish"" may not be as good as the other two, but it tries to strike roughly the same chord in the viewer, although it approaches the subject from a different angle.""Death Wish"" is the ultimate (well, at least the first to really capture the popular imagination) modern vigilante movie. In the 70's the perception was that crime was out of control and criminals were running the streets and the police had no control over anything. Paul Kersey becomes a victim. After a short opening in which it's made clear that Paul and his wife are a normal, happy and loving couple, the madness begins. After Paul and Joanna (Hope Lange) return to their New York City home from a vacation, Joanna and daughter Carol (Kathleen Tolan) are attacked by thieves and rapists. Joanna dies and Carol is left as a ""vegetable"" - as she's so delicately referred to. After a business trip to Arizona, where Paul (a self- confessed bleeding heart liberal and conscientious objector who served in a medical unit n Korea) is introduced to the gun culture where people look after themselves and there's no muggers as a result, Paul returns to New York and becomes an increasingly enthusiastic vigilante, eventually searching out and tempting muggers to go after him so that he can take them out. In the process he becomes a popular hero; an inspiration to others who also start to fight back, and a problem for the police - who want him to stop, but who don't want to arrest him because he has in fact lowered the crime rate by his actions, and they want the criminals to think he might still be out there!The movie deals with a lot of issues - gun control, vigilante justice, out of control crime, and a police department that seems far more concerned with finding the vigilante than with dealing with the criminals the vigilante is dealing with. (I'm not meaning to support the idea of vigilante justice with that last comment, only pointing out the inherent irony.) So there are issues galore, although there's no in- depth analysis offered to any of these issues. They're dealt with on the surface; used as a backdrop for a movie which is not a social analysis of any sort. It's a movie made to appeal to those who were sick to death of not being able to walk the streets at night without fear of being mugged, raped or killed. There's also not too much here by way of actual story. The story is ""guy's family gets attacked; guy seeks vigilante justice."" Aside from Paul himself, there's really no character development; no significant background offered to anyone. In the end, ""Death Wish"" is part of what might be called a mid-70's genre focusing on the little guy and his need to stand up against the big bad society in which he lives. Paul Kersey will never be Rocky Balboa or even Howard Beale, and Charles Bronson will never be Peter Finch or even Sylvester Stallone. But this movie fits in with that concept, and Dino De Laurentiis clearly believed it would strike a chord, because the last scene in the movie is possibly the most obvious set-up for a sequel ever filmed! (Although for some reason the sequel ended up being set in LA rather than Chicago, which you would have expected.) The movie definitely touched a nerve at the time, although it lacked the staying power and continued appeal of the other mid 70's era movies that I've mentioned. 5/10",Death Wish
47,sol1218,Urban Battleground,8,28 October 2003,"Charles Bronson was already a major movie star in 1974 in Europe and a top action actor in the USA but it was ""Death Wish"" released that year that made him the super star that he became. What's so unusual is that in the movie ""Death Wish"" he played a man who was a pacifist all of his life, he served in the Korean War as a conscientious objector, who then turned into the vigilante executioner! A role which Bronson has become known for and identified with more then any of the scores of actions roles that he made during his long film career.Bronson as well as director Michael Winner and writer Brian Garfield touched a raw nerve in ""Death Wish"" with the American people in big cities under siege like no other movie ever did before and, now some 30 years later, after. Since ""Death Wish"" there must have been made over a hundred films with it's theme but none had the impact that ""Death Wish"" with Charles Bronson had. A group of tugs get Joanna Kersey's, Hope Lange, address from a delivery slip of a local grocery store and acting as if their delivering her groceries break into Joanna's apartment and savagely attack her and beat and rape her daughter Carol, Kathleen Tolan. Paul Kersey, Charles Bronson, comes home to learn that his wife and daughter are in the hospital rushes over to see how they are. Kersey finds out that his wife is dead and his daughter is mentally destroyed and needs to be institutionalized for life. The whole world around Paul Kersey falls apart like a house of cards and he's left alone with everything that he loved dead or as good as dead. Some time later going to Arizona to do his job as a land developer for his firm in NYC he's given a .32 handgun as a gift by the person that he worked for Ames Janichill, Stuart Margolis, for the great job that he did for him.One night back home in New York City taking a stroll in the park with the gun on him Kersey is accosted by a local junkie who pulls a handgun on him but Kersey draws first and shoots and kills him. Sick at first over what he did, killed a human being, Kersey like a wild beast from the jungle tasting blood for the fist time begins to roam the streets of New York at night for prey. A vengeful Kersey goes out looking for criminals to put out of commission, like those who killed and raped his wife and daughter, as some kind of revenge and retribution against them. In the process Kersey puts the criminals of the city of New York into a state of absolute terror and panic. In his guerrilla-like actions Kersey knocks off some dozen of them sending the the city's crime rate falling as much as 70%! All this with the ineffective, in stopping crime, police being more interested in stopping ""The Vigilante"" then stopping the criminals! The movie ""Death Wish"" hit a raw nerve with the public as well as the local politicians and police because it showed how, in the movie at least, one man with a gun and knowing how to use it can make a difference when it comes to stopping crime. The story is not that unlikely as those against it would want the public to believe. There's been many times when average people took to protecting themselves, with firearms, and did a much better job then the police; which is just what Paul Kersey did in the movie. That may have been one of the reasons that those in authority were so much against the film. When Bernie Goetz in December 1984 gunned down four muggers, much like Charles Bronson did in the movie ""Death Wish"", who tried to attack him in the New York subway crime dropped a lot more then if one hundred policemen were put on the trains. Nobody can doubt now that Charles Bronson's ""Death Wish"" was not only a major milestone in films about urban crime but also a major milestone in what the public thinks about crime and what's best to do to stop it.",Death Wish
48,lost-in-limbo,The bringer of justice vigilante style!,8,7 January 2007,"An upper-middle class architect and fully blooded liberal, Paul Kersey lives with his wife and his newly engaged daughter in a New York apartment. One afternoon a couple of punks get into the building and brutally rape his daughter and viciously attack his wife. When he gets to the hospital his daughter has slowly fallen into a vegetable state and his wife has died. The grief starts to hit home and Paul takes a work related trip, where he meets a client that takes him to a shooting range and as a farewell gift he receives a 32-calibre revolver. When he returns home, he takes the law into his own hands by dishing out his own justice aimed at crooks.This was the first time I got to watch this one uncut and its still an unheralded cynical urban vigilante piece that only few can match. This supreme item maybe not as shocking, unsparing and cruel like you would think (instead wait around for Death Wish 2 ""1981""), but more so a thoughtfully glum character study and a left-wing political pot shot (pro-gun and vigilante support) slanted into the controversial context.We follow one anti-hero coming with the terms of the confronting ordeal he has encountered and he had enough of watching the crims get-away with things. While the police can't lift a finger to prevent it. So what to do, well no more sitting back and take the law into his hands. We watch the main character spiral into some sort of craving to vent out his pain and anger. He can't seem to stop seeking out crims and thugs, after his somewhat nervous first strike. But even when the police are hinting that they know its him, the rush of it all is just too much to let go and the society doesn't want to take it for granted anymore. So in the context there's little more too it, then just a fully blood revenge pick. Although, there's nothing really too deep there, but it gives us a touch of insight in what's going on in our protagonist's mind and seems to blame the failing system and a depraved society for his actions. It's not really explained through dialogues or emotions, as they are mostly spare here. The broad actions are what tell the story and it suits Charles Bronson's hardened persona. Paul Kersey would go on to be Bronson's iconic role with four sequels to follow on.Director Michael Winner paints a chillingly dread-filled setting of New York and illustrates the savage intentions of those muggers that seem to over-populate the streets. Winner's tightly constructed direction keeps it moving and smoothly patterns out the violence with great control and grit. It's in your face, but his direction suit's the style of film he was going for here. A dynamically breezy score by Herbie Hancock is well integrated into the formula and Arthur J. Ornitz's steely camera-work shapes the film's hard edge. The clunky story is as straightforward as can be and rather heavy-handed in what its got to say. Engraved is a black sense of humour (which more arose from the cops on the case). Charles Bronson nails down the part and brings to his upholding character a well-mannered vibe that could turn unyieldingly cold-hearted when called for. The rest of the performances are fine with Vincent Gardenia standing out amongst the pack as wry police detective and there are minor roles from Jeff Goldblum and Christopher Guest.A very influential studio exploitation flick of the 70s that wasn't afraid to get its hands dirty and speak its mind. It's maybe not as lowbrow as it could have been, but it still manages to keep one transfixed.",Death Wish
49,Robert_duder,An action classic and the patriarch of revenge films,8,6 April 2008,"Death Wish is not just a run of the mill action film that spawned too many sequels...for those who have not seen it you might get that impression but that isn't the case. Death Wish is in fact a dark, gritty, violent and very disturbing look at vigilantism, violence, and so much more. In many ways Death Wish is considered almost campy and yet it has this violent disturbing nature that must have been downright shocking during it's release in 1974 because even now it holds up as being quite disturbing. The rape scene in the beginning would be lucky to manage not getting an NC-17 slapped on it nowadays let alone back then. Director Michael Winner has had great experience in directing and writing and has a really unique style that fits well with Death Wish. This isn't just some random flick about a guy blowing bad guys away, there is a real element of drama and intensity and emotion that is explored not only in this first film but in future installments as well. Although some might say the series was over used and abused there was good reason to continue Kersey's fight.Charles Bronson can be an acquired taste and I would say he is absolutely one of my favorite old time actors. He has this hard, steely, masculinity in his performances and he has had some truly great roles and this original go around for Death Wish was one of them. Even though we've seen him in some really kick butt action roles he manages to introduce us to family man, business man Paul Kersey who finds an outlet for his anger and grief in blowing away crooks, mostly muggers. His character has a significant arc and you can see the changes in him following the crime. He really lights up the screen in a serious dramatic emotional and yet action packed role. Steven Keats, Hope Lange, and Kathleen Tolan are the main supporting cast plays Bronson's son in law, wife and daughter. They don't have a whole lot of time on screen except for the actual happening of the crime which as mentioned is pretty brutal but they serve their purpose to set up the story but don't really take away from Bronson's one man vengeance show. Vincent Gardenia is the main cop sent to stop Bronson's vendetta but not to necessarily kill him but get him to stop so as to not make him a martyr. Gardenia is good but his role is small and I would have liked to have seen more of a cat and mouse, adversary type relationship between them but it never really pans out.Ultimately Death Wish poses the question it means to which is do you believe that Kersey's vendetta is right or is he as bad as they are? One thing that is almost campy and unbelievable is how much crime does exist around Kersey in particular. I mean everywhere he goes...Subway, buildings, random street someone tries to mug or rob him so he can blow them away. I mean crime is bad...even know let alone 30 years ago but that rampant should mean everyone should carry a loaded pistol to blow bad guys away. He also never really resolves his wifes case which is unfortunate but instead he finds this relief in fighting crime in the most brutal manner. Still Death Wish is a cult classic and a must see and it doesn't disappoint for entertainment value or even for a more serious message behind it. It is still one of my favorite Bronson films definitely. 8/10",Death Wish
50,ElMaruecan82,From pointless violence to violence with a point...,8,31 July 2018,"Michael Winner's exploration of the criminal side of New York City is no news after movies like ""Shaft"", ""Midnight Cowboy"", ""The French Connection"" or ""Mean Streets"". Its novelty though is in the character of Paul Kersey, an ordinary man like the Yin to Harry Callahan's Yang. Both ""Dirty Harry"" and ""Death Wish"" are complementary because they speak the same statement about the ""only answer to violence"" except that Paul is more relatable and accessible than Harry. He's an architect, a liberal, a former Conscience Objector, with a beautiful wife (Hope Lange) whose beauty doesn't grace the screen for too long, a married daughter and a steady job as an architect (and we do see him work, it's not just character-branding). The contrast between Paul's life and his environment is startling and the opening credits takes you from the idyllic beauty of Hawaii to the urban New City musically presented like the anteroom of Hell and it's all about how much time it'll take for Paul to realize it. Speaking of time, it's interesting the way a movie that basically codified the vigilante-trope is deprived of the plot-related clichés that wouldn't have ruined it in the first place. Some films can be predictably great, ""Death Wish"" is surprisingly good.Being part of what can be called a ""modern audience"", I naturally expected a climactic and bloody confrontation between Paul and the punks who murdered his wife and raped his daughter. But as a ""New Hollywood"" fan, I feel guilty for such immature expectations as there was no reason for Kersey to bump into them during his one-man crusade against violence. That enough was a triumph of restrained writing, if not intelligent, and what makes ""Death Wish"" even more powerful is its lack of emotional juice even when it's called for, Paul's fight is personal but not taken personally. As he tells his son-in-law (Steven Keats represents our point of view): ""I should groan and moan the rest of my life?"".We're so used to deal with widowers going all berserk about the loss of their dear one that a character like Paul can't fail to appeal, Charles Bronson said that he had a face chiseled in a rock, the same could be said about his heart. Here is a man who is no emotionless cold zombie but tackles his new assignment as something that ""must be done"" because there's no other way. The film only starts to sin when it turns to an addictive game, but that occurs so late that it doesn't even seem to be the film's point. Maybe the point lies in the way Paul contemplates his accomplishments and life philosophy before seeing them sacrificed at the altar of pointless violence then examines the world of violence with the daring curiosity of a child who gets his finger close to a flame, until he decides to dirty his hands... and then we go from 'pointless violence' to 'violence with a point'.Many would argue that even crime has a ""point"", as wicked as it, muggers attack to get their fix of crack or heroine, to scare good citizens and have their share of thrills by shaking the establishment, the infamous rape sequence is a disturbing moment but even in the midst of the horror, you wonder whether they raped the girl or the class she was belonging to. The class aspect is integral to the film's message, when you have a job and a family, you have many assets to protect because you have the right to value them and to defend yourself. This is how the issues of gun control intrude themselves in the questioning that leads to Paul Kersey's final decision. During a mission in Arizona, he meets a businessman (Stuart Margolin) who introduces him to his passion for guns. And when you expect a quick shortcut, the film takes its time to show us what will finally trigger Kersey's decision. He witnesses a Western representation and see the audience's lack of reaction as an illustration of citizens' powerlessness, later, he asks his son-in-law what has become with the pioneer spirit and the necessity to protect yourself. The film isn't exactly an incantation to gun in the sense that it establishes it as a survival move than a necessity. And the film isn't the revenge crusade everyone will expect, it's a series of night strolls where Kersey makes himself an easy prey only to shoot to death any assaulter. He makes the headlines quick and become a legend, inspiring people to defend themselves and muggers to think twice and people to talk about him, even the Officer in charge of the investigation (Vincent Gardenia) reminded me of Jim Gordon's relationship with Batman. As for the public opinion, feelings are mixed: ""Has criminality decreased?"" ""No, muggers will only attack old women"" ""Is he racist because he kills more Blacks and Latinos"" ""No, it's because they're proportionally more present"". In fact, it's like the whole film anticipated Youtube, Facebook or maybe Twitter comments. People just love straight shooters and maybe that's why a few liberal critics didn't totally approve the film. Ebert called it a quasi-fascist fantasy... maybe borrowing the line from Pauline Kael's ""Dirty Harry"" review and Vincent Canby accused the film of being a dangerous falsification of truth from New York outsiders. Speaking for myself, I think the film has at least the guts to question the question (so to speak) while dealing with a man who shoots first and ""ask the questions later"". The problem, if problem is the right word, lies in the evolution of Kersey from a man who resents violence to a man who enjoys it, his last grin at the end is supposed to be a satisfactory moment or maybe it's a triumph of cynicism, if these thugs enjoy so much being criminals, why shouldn't he be enjoying himself?",Death Wish
51,bowmanblue,The original (and best!),9,23 October 2018,"Okay, so there have probably been other 'revenge' films made before 1974's 'Death Wish,' but this is the film that really set the genre alight and possibly brought it more into the mainstream. Maybe because the story is so simple? A man loses his family to a gang of street thugs and decides to deal out his own brand of 'justice.' Also, Charles Bronson had been around for a while in Hollywood, normally playing a tough dependable character (soldier or cowboy I believe), but, again, this is the film that cemented him into true popular culture as the film's protagonist, the reluctant vigilante, Paul Kersey.Perhaps the best thing about 'Death Wish' is that it's a story where the main character has an 'arc' for his journey. He doesn't start off an outright 'bada$$' and he's not a particularly physically intimidating specimen of a man (in the way the eighties action stars like Stallone and Schwarzenegger might be considered). He's an easy-going guy who despises violence and is only pushed into his new role through a series of tragic circumstances. It's certainly Charles Bronson's defining film and he carries it all the way.Although many of us will shed no tears as the muggers and assorted criminals start dropping like flies, the film never really glamourises violence and does as good a job as possible to present the other side of the argument that two wrongs don't make a right and that we should be leaving the handling of criminals to the proper authorities, i.e. the police.This whole 'revenge' formula has been used to varying degrees of success throughout the years, but 'Death Wish' will always stand the test of time as the original, most gritty (and realistic for the time - how Kersey would get on today with the culture of camera phones and CCTV is best left addressed by the - questionable - 2018 remake of the same name) and definitely best. It's a slow burner and don't expect too much in the way of action scenes (it's not really an outright action movie - that honour would probably be bestowed on 'Part III'), but it definitely still holds up today in terms of cinema history.",Death Wish
52,CuriosityKilledShawn,"Christ, they made FOUR sequels to THIS!!!",1,6 March 2007,"I really can't think of a word more appropriate than 'tawdry' to describe this incredibly boring drek. It may well have been regarded as hardcore back in the early seventies (but I don't see how) but Death Wish is actually as tame as a newborn kitten, especially in comparison to the first sequel.Ironically surnamed director Michael Winner shoots the film in the most mundane and sterile way possible. You'd be forgiven for thinking that you're watching a slide show. And ugly photography doesn't help the brain-dead plot.Charles Bronson (typically void of emotion or expression) is Paul Kersey, an architect based in NYC and a 'bleeding heart liberal' apparently. When a bunch of thugs (including a young, completely nonthreatening Jeff Goldblum) break into his house, beat-up and sexually attack (but not rape) his daughter he changes his views. After his wife mysteriously dies from her not-really-that-bad wounds he cracks and decides that killing random thugs on the streets is the best thing to do.Remember this was the early 70s and back then NYC was rife with crime and muggings. Michael Loser probably thought he was onto some groundbreaking commentary when an ordinary man takes the law into his own hands because the police are incompetent. But here's the stupid thing, the cops may not care about innocent people being killed so why the hell do they make a HUGE case out of the first vigilante killing? They don't care when decent civilians die but make a circus over some random shot junkie? Nonsense! I could call this part of the film 'fun' but since it takes ages to really get going I was already sighing and checking how much time was left. At 85 minutes I was beginning to wonder how he was ever going to find the people who attacked his family and sort them out with only a few minutes of the running time left. It turns out that they are never seen again, so they basically get away it. WHAT KIND OF ENDING IS THAT??? What a rip-off.Compared to Death Wish II (my God, what a disgusting film) this film seems relatively okay. But alone it's yet another exploitational piece of crap by a notoriously incompetent director. A classic is sure as hell ain't!",Death Wish

The behavior of street criminals is laughably exaggerated to justify the vigilantism. This inept film inexplicably became a huge success and spawned four sequels. Bronson's acting is so wooden that one fears not that he'll be attacked by thugs but by termites. It's safe to say that he didn't strain any acting muscles in this role. Gardenia, on the other hand, chews the scenery as a cop. The only decent performances are turned in by Hope, basically in a cameo as Bronson's wife, and Keats as his son-in-law.

Charles Bronson is great in the film! His emotions are very believable! Jeff Goldblum believe it or not is in the film and has a big part! He looks like a very young man.

55,redryan64,"Though not at all a Pleasant Film, this Story confronts the greatest Domestic Challenge that America had then and still faces in the 21st Century.",10,12 November 2007,"A highly civilized, technologically developed and culturally ""refined"" a Nation as the United States of America has found itself at the mid point of the 20th Century in a contradictory position of having a crime rate in its major cities that would be more like that of a barbaric, developing 3rd World Country. The accomplishments in the areas of science, literature, painting, architecture and athletics are shamefully dragged down by the one disgustingly grim reality. And that is that the streets of our cities are not safe.In our quest for civility and peace, we have gone to the path of legislating laws that have continued to restrict if not outright violate our own Constitution. And that is namely the Second Amendment, which states that ""..the right to bear arms shall not be abridged."" Now, please notice that the Amendment does NOT say that our Government, be it State or National, may grant us permission, because our Founding Fathers knew that the Right of Self-Protection is a gift to Mankind from Our Creator, not of any man-made body, no matter how well intentioned. And furthermore, it is very common sense friendly.OUR STORY We open up with a view of New York City, Manhattan life in the contemporary setting of 1974. We see two obviously well dressed, well to do women, Mrs. Joanna Kersey (Hope Lange) and her daughter, Mrs. Carol Toby (Kathleen Tolan) doing the shopping at their grocery store. When they pay for the order, there is a delivery slip that is left with it in the box with their address.A band of three Street Scum Sociopaths (Jeff Goldblum, Christopher Logan and Gregory Rozakis) of the very worst order read the delivery slip and make a beeline for the exclusive residential property and going around the to the back service entrance, they circumvent the main entrance and the Dorman. They then go to the right floor where they gain entrance to the Kersey Residence by announcing they were the grocery delivery man.Now dear folks, kindly readers, what follows has to be the most disgustingly realistic, brutal and out and out sickening scene ever captured on the cinema screen. Because the two women have so little money, the three angered by their waste of time, attack them violently, and violate the daughter sexually, molesting her, raping and forcing her into fellatio. The mother, who had earlier cautioned her daughter to just keep quiet and cooperate, gets beaten viciously with a blackjack, slapped back and forth across her face.The two men, Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson) and his son-in-law Jack Toby (Steven Keats) receive word that their wives have been taken to a Hospital Emergency Room, in poor physical condition After a seemingly endless runaround at the Hospital, Jack finds out his wife is in stable condition. When Paul inquires about his wife, he is flatly and abruptly told; ""Mr. Kersey, your Wife died about 20 minutes ago!"" With the Wife killed and the daughter in serious mental condition and possibly facing permanently hospitalization, Paul Kersey gets himself lost in his work. Immersing himself completely in a planned housing development in the Southwest, in either New Mexico or Arizona, Kersey goes there in person to work out a compromise about the number of houses to be built with Land Developer, Ames Jainchill (Stuart Margolin).On the occasion of accompanying Mr. Jainchill as his guest at his Gun Club, Paul is found out to be an expert marksman and having been a Conscious Objector, assigned as a Medic in the Korean War.Returning to New York, Mr. Kersey, while reading through his back-log of mail, finds the photos of him and his wife from their last vacation trip. Tearful and feeling more lonely than ever, Paul opens the gift package given to him by Mr. Jainchill at the airport when he left the Southwest; its contents  a .32 Calibre Revolver.Taking an evening stroll in the Wintry City Landscape, he purposely goes to spots clearly off the beaten path, and hence more isolated from the safety of numbers. He is confronted by a junkie stick-up man with a gun, whom he promptly dispatches from this world. He had his new .32 pistol with him.That is just the start of a one man crusade in which the unknown Mr. Kersey is dubbed ""The Vigilante"" by the gentlemen of the Press. We follow his exploits as he continues to carry on his new found role as armed and dangerous decoy.The story continually gives us examples of just how even a well trained and hard working Police Department cannot have Cops everywhere and that it is still up to us to be prepared to defend ourselves.At the time of its initial release, there were some critics who described DEATH WISH as being gratuitously violent and having an appeal to a lynch-mob mentality. Well, we figure these were the folks who are far-removed from any of these troubles and can afford their own protective services.As for the cast, some people we thought deserved mention include:Vincent Gardenia,Stephen Elliot, Robert Kya-Hill, Ed Grover, Hank Garrett.As far as there being any theme or message in DEATH WISH, most certainly it is one about the rendering of the public impotent and helpless with the passage of a lot of ridiculous gun laws, which only the law-abiding would follow. It's almost as if the Bleating Hearts form high in their Ivory Towers; know what's best for we ""little people"". I mean they must follow the line of reasoning that would declare that we would be safer from drowning if only the Life Guards had the Life Preservers.Oh, yeah; see DEATH WISH, but skip the sequels.",Death Wish
56,pmtelefon,It's better than its reputation,9,7 March 2021,"Because its sequels weren't so hot, ""Death Wish"" doesn't get the credit it deserves. It's a much better movie than the sequels. It's a mean, exciting and surprisingly emotional movie. Charles Bronson is an underrated actor and he gives one of is best performances in this move. The only demerit ""Death Wish"" gets has to do with the brutality of the attack scene. I've seen this movie a bunch of times and as I get older I find myself more and more rattled by that scene.

58,videorama-759-859391,Death walks the streets in the form of Bronson,9,14 October 2015,"The one that started it all, and of course the best, sees our unforgettable vigilante, Paul Kersey (Bronson), deliver justice to those punks at night, who like to do stick ups, and rob us innocent folk. But it's the catalyst of this, that is most interesting. Bronson wife (The Ghost and Mrs Muir's Hope Lange) and daughter in law are raped, (Lange not surviving) by a group of punks (the head an early Jeff Goldblum, like you've never seen em before). The daughter in law has resorted to a state of catatonia, blocking it out, making her, as her husband, describes ""a vegetable"". I imagine this film at the time, would of stirred up a lot of controversy, or may'be caution some muggers out there, on the New York streets at night. The early rape scene is quite intense and disturbing (I was 14 when I first saw this movie) and that's the scene that stands out. Bronson of course, doesn't show enough range of emotions, yet still is wonderfully effective, doing it his own way. I like Stuart Margolin too, and really it's Vincent Gardenia, as the Inspector who's notable, who really has taken Bronson's side from the start. What wasn't believable, really, in this otherwise excellent film, was some of the victims, and community fighting back at muggers, like that old bag lady, which did provide some laughs, on that news bulletin. The film does make you question, should these muggers die, and are we right to fight back? If judging against Goldblum and his freaks at the start, it's an easy ""Yes"". Goldblum and co company never get caught, and when Bronson asks, the chief detective ""Is there a chance they'll catch these guys"" and he answers, ""Yes, there's always a chance"", hey that's really telling like it is. I myself would be afraid to walk the streets of New York, today. One defining moment is when Gardenia, about to exit Bronson's hospital room, coughs with laugh at shock, to Bronson's former statement. The last shot of a sickly smiling Bronson, cocking his finger at some muggers at a bus station, should be etched in the annals of movie history. One fault moment- when the son goes over to Bronsons for dinner, and he's about to turn the music down, just before this, you'll notice a mic, partially sticking down in shot.",Death Wish

I've seen the movie several times at long intervals. Every time I liked it. Because it is well done and resists the proof of time. The scene of the cemetery in the wintertime reminded me of the time when I visited the tomb of the director, Michael Winner, in London.

Three thugs (Jeff Goldblum, Christopher Logan, Gregory Rozakis) follow Joanna and the Kersey's daughter Carol (Kathleen Tolan) home from the super market. A violent encounter ensues in which Joanna is killed and Carol is raped.Carol's husband Jack (Steven Keats) conveys the news to Kersey and the two rush to the hospital. After learning of his wife's death, Kersey becomes despondent and is sent to Arizona for a change of scene. There, he meets fellow architect Ames Jainchill (Stuart Margolin) and the two become friends. Jainchill gives Kersey a gift as he leaves.On his return home, Kersey learns that his daughter has become a vegetable. While unpacking Kersey discovers that the gift from his friend is a revolver. With the police making no progress in finding his wife's killers, Kersey reluctantly takes matters into his own hands.While walking home one night, Kersey is confronted by a mugger whom he kills. Although shaken by the fact that he has killed, Kersey begins to revel in his role as the ""Vigilante"" and soon is responsible for more killings. As the Vigilante becomes a local hero, the police assign Inspector Frank Ochoa (Vincent Gardenia) to the case.Bronson evokes some sympathy as the first distraught Kersey and later as the vigilante killer. While never a serious threat for an Academy Award, he does give one of his best performances here. Gardenia on the other hand, as the sniffling detective steals the picture.Other recognizable faces include William Redfield as Kersey's friend and co-worker and Christopher Guest, Olympia Dukakis, Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs, Paul Dooley and Hank Garrett in various small roles.

""Death Wish"" divided the country into liberals or those who had already been mugged/burgled/assaulted and were either victims of police indifference/inefficiency or of the justice system's reluctance to deal effectively with criminals who preyed on the vulnerable. Liberals,with characteristic intellectual arrogance,poured scorn on the movie.It was ""fascist""( an adjective also bestowed on Don Seigel's masterpiece ""Dirty Harry""),""populist"",""racist"" and several other of the Highgate Mafia's favourite ""-ists"" all at the same time. Never mind the statistics carefully gathered by director Michael Winner that the majority of muggings at the time in New York were committed by Hispanics or African - Americans,often against their own communities,and that Hispanics and African - Americans cheered as loudly as anyone else in the theatres when Mr C.Bronson took the law away from those who had for too long been sheltering behind it. Despite being called ""immoral"",it is in fact a highly moral movie. One man is doing what should be the task of any government ; ensuring that its innocent citizens can conduct their lives peaceably and without fear of violent assault. 30 - odd years later we can look at a Britain awash with gun and knife crime,where an underclass has been bred unrestrained by any fear of legal interference in their culture of contempt for the rest of society and its laws,where a government who pledged to be ""Tough on crime - tough on the causes of crime"" continues to whimper ineffectually at ""socially inept"" parenting and roll out the Human Rights Act at every opportunity in order to justify it's unwillingness to meet its obligations to those who voted it into power. One day soon ""Death Wish"" may be coming to a street near you,and if it does Mr Michael Winner will not be to blame. Mr C.Bronson and Mr V.Gardenia are both oustanding as the vigilante and the police chief hunting him down.New York looks as cold and threatening as it undoubtedly was.Now it is one of the safest big cities in the world,and you can bet that change was not achieved by wholesale implementation of the Human Rights Act,a legislative tool originally designed to protect those imprisoned in totalitarian regimes,not drug - addled criminals with sub - zero I.Q.s and Legal Aid briefs. The Establishment and the media hate Michael Winner because he does not conform to their idea of what a movie director should do i.e. make movies that they approve of.Ken Loach or Terence Davies he ain't.

62,jimbo-53-186511,Fairly good although I'll admit I gradually became less impressed as the film progressed,6,7 October 2014,"Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson) is an everyday New York City architect who one day discovers that his wife has been murdered by street punks and his daughter has been badly injured by the same group of yobs that murdered his wife. Paul, understandably, is angry and upset following this incident and initially turns to the police for help. However, when the police seemingly have no leads and when his daughter refuses to look through mug shots, Paul decides that he will take to the streets and dispense his own form of justice on the muggers and low life that are living in New York.The biggest problem for me with this film is that it starts out as one thing and then changes to another without much logic surrounding this narrative shift. Let me explain; Paul's wife is killed by a group of robbers and his daughter ends up being badly injured by them. This isn't a whodunit as the robbers break into the apartment unmasked and attack the two women. An investigation begins to take place but comes to a halt due to there being no leads. Then... well that's the end of that thread and then it never gets re-established again. The rest of the film then seems to focus on Kersey prowling the mean streets of New York dishing out punishment on unsuspecting muggers. I didn't mind that this aspect factored into the film as Kersey becomes an 'anti-hero' and as mentioned during the film he alone actually helped reduce muggings overall in the city. What surprised me is that there was no focus on anyone tracking down his wife's killers? After the first 20-25 minutes this is never mentioned which just seemed really odd to me. If you think about it, those that killed his wife were far worse than any of the would be 'chancers' that Kersey killed because their attack was far from 'opportunistic'. Those that targeted Kersey could definitely be classed as 'opportunists'. I would have preferred it if this aspect had acted as a sub plot and if Kersey tracking down his wife's killers would have acted as the main focus of the film. Again it might just be me but it seemed strange from a narrative perspective. Even more bizarrely, the police then focus all their attention on catching Kersey again without bothering looking for his wife's killers?Going back to Kersey's family, did anyone else think it strange that they were side-lined after the first half of the film? There is a very moving scene where Kersey goes to see his daughter in hospital when he gets back from Arizona and he gives her a hug after he is told that she is in a catatonic state - that scene was beautiful. Shortly after that, the film forgets about his daughter and son which again seemed strange to me. It's almost like the film was making one step forward and then taking two steps back. I also thought it was odd that they showed clips of other 'anti-heroes' dealing with muggers in their own bizarre ways - it didn't sit well within the tone of the film.Overall, this is a decent film and as mentioned my only really big gripe is that it seemed to lose all focus in the second half. Why did both the police and Kersey give up on trying to find his wife's killers?",Death Wish

64,barnabyrudge,"Started a trend for violent vigilante actioners. Slick, enjoyable, well made film, far better than its increasingly dismal sequels.",7,24 November 2004,"The original Death Wish movie is still the only one worth watching. A slick, well-made and enjoyably amoral vigilante drama, it was a huge box office hit in its day. It starts with a chilling rape sequence - still provocative thirty years on - and develops from there into an exciting and perversely funny story of how a man whose life is affected by these disturbing events gets his revenge.New York businessman Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson) is devastated when his wife (Hope Lange) and daughter (Kathleen Tolan) are sexually assaulted in their own home. His wife dies from her injuries and his daughter is so deeply traumatized that she is left in a permanent vegetative state. Kersey tries to get some normality back into his life through work, but deep down inside he's burning for revenge. He knows he will never get the actual gang who harmed his family, but he also realises that crime in general is spreading through the city like a plague. So, armed with a gun and a sense of vigilante justice, he starts patrolling the streets by night, killing muggers, hoodlums and rapists. But for how long can he hand out his own brand of justice without being caught? And at what point does his course of action stop being justifiable? When does he become just as bad as the crooks he is trying to rub out?The film is based on a Brian Garfield novel, but in the book vigilantism was illustrated as an extension of crime - just another problem as opposed to a solution. Here Michael Winner, a director always happy to create a few ripples, presents the vigilante as an out-and-out hero. The film basically gives a great big nod of approval to Kersey's actions. The sense of humour really helps the film (I still laugh at the scene where some construction-workers kick the hell out of a crook, and one workman nonchalantly states to the TV reporters: ""Erm, we roughed him up a bit before the cops arrived!"") Death Wish was a pretty influential film for its era, and in spite of its dated air and its morally dubious stance, it is still a great flick. Just make sure you steer clear of its four utterly terrible sequels.",Death Wish

The tough & rugged Charles Bronson is perfect for this role & actually gives his best performance here as Paul Kersey!!!
This is a timeless tale of evil scum hurting innocent people & destroying the lives of their loved ones, it's something that has always happened & always will.
So Death Wish is a movie that will always be relevant as long as humans exist!!! It's a powerful & gritty revenge Thriller that everyone should see.
I totally agree with what Paul Kersey does in this film!!! Who wouldn't want to get some sort of revenge on scum out there if they hurt your loved ones?
So this film speaks to me on a different level to other pure entertainment movies,here is a real life dark tale of an ordinary family man pushed to his limits & had enough with the low life scum out there that seem to always get away with their evil crimes!!! Although made in the 70's probably even more relevant today!!! The new york city of the 70's was a brutal & scary place to live & director Michael winner captures that atmosphere perfectly.
This was the very first film i ever saw that introduced me to the excellent Bronson & now I'm a huge fan of his & have tons of his movies.
DEATH WISH (1974) is Bronson's best movie ever & his greatest performance as an actor & his vigilante Paul Kersey is my number 1 favourite movie character of all time!!!!

66,fertilecelluloid,"Brutal, forceful genre material",8,30 November 2005,"Charles Bronson and director Michael Winner became synonymous with vigilante cinema for a while because, quite simply, they hit creative and financial paydirt with this. The story is simplistic and the execution is straightforward, but Bronson's Paul Kersey struck a chord with a public fed up with rising street crime and a justice system hamstrung by liberal legalities.Kersey is an incredibly likable vigilante, a father and husband whose life is changed by the brutal violation of those closest to him. Realizing that the police are unable to stem the rising tide of crime, he buys himself a gun and goes looking for the men who destroyed his family. The movie IS his revenge. But in addition to his personal mission of vengeance, Kersey deliberately baits assorted street thugs in order to kill them. As a result, he becomes a hero to the impotent authorities and, ultimately, a dangerous role model who must be tethered.Winner has a heavy-handed, forceful style that suits brutal genre material like this. Accompanied by Herbie Hancock's driving, literal score, he delivers a taut thriller that plays well to a blood-hungry audience eager to lap up quick cinematic murder.Bronson is his usual stalwart self, conveying both friendliness and callous regard for human life with a look here, a grimace there. Most of the street scum, including a debuting Jeff Goldblum, are one-dimensional and mean-spirited, while the victims of their harassment are either old, innocent or naive.As nasty as Hollywood flicks get and not modest in its ambitions, this first ""Death Wish"" is a keeper.",Death Wish
67,dworldeater,The mother of all vigilante movies and Bronson at his best!,10,8 May 2014,"Death Wish once again pairs together the excellent actor/director team of Charles Bronson and director Michael Winner. Bronson is Paul Kersey, a successful businessman and father/husband who's wife and daughter were brutally attacked and raped in a home invasion. Kersey's wife did not survive the attack and his daughter is left in a comatose state and lives in a sanitarium. The culprits of the crime are unlikely to be brought to justice. The bereaved and angry father/husband walks the hard streets of New York City and brings his own brand of justice and retribution. Charles Bronson is brilliant here and shows a wide range of emotions from fear, sorrow, revulsion and anger. In this world of violence Paul Kersey is most certainly not unaffected and in his downward spiral, he is nearly insane by the end of the movie.

Alongside that of Harmonica in Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon a Time In The West"", the role of vigilante architect Paul Kersey is arguably the most important role in Bronson's career, and the role that made him the undisputed number 1 leading man to play characters taking the law into their own hands. This was already the fourth collaboration of Bronson and director Michael Winner, and what a team they were: Their work together also includes the equally brilliant Western ""Chato's Land"" of 1972, another tough-minded and uncompromising 70s Bronson cult-favorite.

The allegation of promoting self-administered justice may be justified with the film's sequels, but it sure isn't justified to accuse the original ""Death Wish"" of anything like that. It is merely a film about a man in an exceptional situation, whose desperation and fury make him take the law in his own hands, and about the resulting appreciation by the masses and the media. The film may differ from Brian Garfield's novel (which I have not yet read), but that doesn't make it a glorification of vigilantism, in my opinion.Paul Kersey (Bronson) is a kind, liberal architect living in New York city with his family. After a vicious attack in which his wife is killed and his daughter brutally raped in their own home, however, Kersey begins to change... ""Death Wish"" is an amazing film that builds up a very particular kind of tension. In this original film, Paul Kersey does not hunt down any particular criminals, but he just walks New York's mean streets at night, and deliberately acts out of self defense whenever he is attacked by muggers. The outbursts of violence are of course some of the most memorable moments in the film. The violence is very realistic and often shocking. The attack in the beginning is particularly disturbing, and many the later sequences, when Kersey has become the vigilante already, are unforgettable. Charles Bronson is one of my personal favorite actors, and his performance as Paul Kersey is plain brilliant. No other actor could have played this role even nearly as greatly as Bronson did, and no other actor will ever be THE film vigilante that Bronson is for eternity. The supporting cast includes Hope Lange as Kersey's wife and young Jeff Goldblum in his very first role. Whether you like it or not, ""Death Wish"" is a film you will not forget quickly. Four sequels followed, the first of which was highly entertaining, the rest barely worth watching. The original remains the masterpiece. This is THE vigilante movie and an absolute classic that no lover of film can afford to miss!",Death Wish
69,Jonny_Numb,guilty pleasure undermined by reactionary politics,6,6 October 2005,"What this influential, reactionary meditation on vigilantism lacks is evidenced in any one of its sequels and/or rip-offs: it tries too hard to be some bold political statement, which erases the joyful adrenalin rush of seeing Charles Bronson blow away muggers in New York City. The plot is simple enough: a group of thugs (including a young Jeff Goldblum) rape Bronson's daughter and murder his wife, causing him to lash out and dispense justice where the police seem to be lacking. ""Death Wish"" is directed with A-list gloss by Michael Winner, the cast is in fine form, and the cinematography brilliantly captures the wintry chill in the airthe film has a lot going for it, and even as pure fantasy, it works, but its buildup seems to plod, and once Bronson is lashing out, the film falters due to its own shallow sermonizing and symbolism. Comparatively, if it had followed the purely exploitative path of its descendants, it might have been that much more entertaining in the low-down, dirty way it was intended.",Death Wish
70,truemythmedia,A Few Great Scenes,6,17 June 2019,"This movie is alright. Bronson himself wasn't bad in the film, and the set up for his rampage was incredibly well done, though it was really rough to watch. For an action movie, it's pretty slow, though I'm sure in the 70s it was a nail-biter. Most of the action sequences are less than two or three minutes long, and consist of nothing more than Bronson shooting his gun a few times. By today's standards, this film's action would be considered pretty boring, and that was something I didn't expect from a movie that has attained such a big cult status. There are some redeemable moments that bump what would've been a 2.5 Star rating to a 3 Star, but overall the film is the definition of average.",Death Wish

This is the way anyone who has experienced personal loss would probably act given the same circumstances. We want to lash out at those who are scum and prey upon us and others.

The need for revenge must be ingrained. Why else would we watch this and the four sequels as well as other revenge movies like Death Sentence or The Brave One. In fact, I know one critic that categorizes all movies into love stories or revenge movies. Interesting observation.Bronson was made by this role, turned down by Frank Sinatra.

72,Easygoer10,"The First of All ""Sequel Films""",6,28 May 2019,"I remember when this film was released (1974). It was very popular, made on a smallish budget and made a lot of money, for the time. ""When Death Wish IV came out, I remember laughing with an actress friend of mine about it. Little did i know how many other films would follow the same ""blueprint(s): The first is obvious: A man seeking and receiving revenge for unspeakable crimes against his family, and sequels made of that film. Primarily due to the financial incentives, from then to this day, hundreds of ""Vigilante"" films have been made; even worse, the same goes for thousands of ""Sequels"". These formulas, plus using ""comic books"" (or ""Graphic Novels"", as they are called), are the 3 worst aspects of Hollywood. It is a terrible thing to see something which has this occur, like ""The Fast and The Furious"" (2001); especially when 1 of the 2 primary characters died (Paul Walker) in a car wreck after the 6th sequel had been made. They should have stopped out of respect, but no way: Hollywood studios are some of the greediest people in the business world. ""Halloween"" (1978), which legendary director John Carpenter made, was also followed by countless more films. The irony is, I liked the originals of both of these films. ""Star Wars"", ""Star Trek"", and countless films have become ""Franchises"". It is sickening; worse, it contributes to originality. I hate it.",Death Wish
73,alexanderdavies-99382,The best one out of all of them.,8,18 June 2017,"""Death Wish"" was the film that made Charles Bronson into an overnight star and a box office draw. He had made several movies in Europe for a while and became a star over there. He had worked with the British director Michael Winner on three previous occasions and the films they made are great. The above film is their best collaboration. Released in 1974, ""Death Wish"" pulls no punches in depicting the efforts of Paul Kersey who kills off as many muggers and street punks as he can. These events have resulted after his wife is murdered and his daughter viciously attacked. The audience is truly on the side of Bronson as he takes the law into his own hands. New York is the ideal setting and location for this film. It works to the films advantage to be made in winter time. This adds to the gritty and harsh look of the film - shades of ""The French Connection."" Charles Bronson was never an actor in the usual sense of the word but his image is perfect for his role here. The supporting cast are excellent, look out for Jeff Goldblum in an early role as a mugger. The plot is fairly streamlined which is an advantage, as the film is kept on an even keel without any unnecessary subplots. The violence isn't particularly pleasant, especially at the beginning of the film. It is no wonder that the B.B.F.C refused to grant ""Death Wish"" a video certificate when all videos considered for release in the early 80s in Britain, had to be reclassified. As a result, ""Death Wish"" was exceptionally hard to obtain. Then in 2000, the film suddenly turned up on video, albeit in a censored form. Now on DVD, we have the uncensored version. There are some great action scenes along the way but ""Death Wish"" is more than that, it is making both political and social comments about vigilantes and law and order in general. The dialogue is certainly above average, considering the films content. It could have easily been the case of just producing cliché- ridden stuff but luckily, this doesn't happen. It is debatable whether Bronson is slightly unhinged in some way, as the vigilante. I would say it is more likely he is expressing the anger and injustice he feels after what has happened to his family and to his way of life. The sequels that followed are pretty good but the original is still my favourite. A classic film of 1970s American cinema and not to be missed.",Death Wish
74,PredragReviews,"""Well, what if the cops can't handle this?""",9,18 June 2016,"This movie tapped into what people's feelings were as far as the crime issue goes during that time. Unless you lived in that era, it is hard to see how a film like this could be so controversial at the time. But the very thought of an ordinary citizen taking the law into his own hands was unheard of. After many years of insipid sequels and countless imitators, Death Wish still shines like a gem. This is one of Charles Bronson's best performances and he is very convincing and believable as the conscientious objector turned vigilante. His later performances in the subsequent sequels were as emotional man involved as a wet dish rag. Steven Keats is excellent as the beleaguered son in law, Jack, and Vincent Gardenia shines as the police inspector Frank Ochoa who is determined to apprehend the vigilante.The movie was and is controversial. The liberals hate it, the conservatives love it. The move has been attacked as exaggerating the danger of urban crime. It doesn't. I lived in the very area and at the very time of the movie. Virtually everyone I knew (including myself) had some kind of incident with a street criminal. The movie is not realistic with regard to what would have happened to Paul Kersy once found out. He would have been arrested and charged with illegal possession of a firearm, and other felonies. He would have been attacked on the editorial page of the New York Times, by Mayor Lindsey, the police commissioner and slew of newspaper columnists and TV commentators. The families of the slain criminals would have sued him, most likely with William Kunstler as the lawyer. There would have been a relentless and effective campaign of personal destruction directed at Paul culminating in a trial. So in this sense the movie fails as social commentary, because it doesn't confront the real issues of crime and punishment and urban politics. But it succeeds splendidly as an emotional cathartic.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",Death Wish
75,Sandcooler,Instant classic,9,14 August 2014,"There isn't really that much you can do wrong with a movie when you give Charles Bronson a gun, but even aside from that ""Death Wish"" is just tremendous. On the surface it's a pretty straight-forward thriller, but it takes a while before you really notice how many layers it has. Do two wrongs really make a right? Is the instant satisfaction you feel when Paul Kersey blows away another mugger fully justified? The movie gradually transforms into a powerful social commentary, but it never forces a message onto the viewer and just trusts on the audience's intelligence (this was made a while ago...). In the end, you still don't know what you should really feel for Kersey. Most of the time he plays good Samaritan, but eventually he just has so little trouble with killing people that you do start feeling uneasy. ""Death Wish"" is drama rather than action, it goes for style rather than body count. And if that's not fully what you're into, there are plenty of shoot-em-up sequels around that are entertaining in their own right. However, this one will always rightfully be considered the best of the franchise.",Death Wish

77,Chase_Witherspoon,Taking care of business,9,12 May 2012,"Social justice commentary aside, this Bronson vehicle still packs a punch as an action-thriller with a particularly suspenseful ivories score by Herbie Hancock and a typically understated performance by Bronson as the wealthy architect, husband and father whose family is destroyed following a brutal home invasion. Bronson emerges from his grief as the all purpose avenger, hunting those who prey on the vulnerable and innocent, propping up the inept police department's attempts to control the ever burgeoning crime rate. It's amazing how much damage you can do to a person with just a row of quarters and a sock.An expansive cast includes Hope Lange as Bronson's wife, Steven Keats as his son-in-law, Vincent Gardenia as the weary detective and William Redfield as Bronson's co-worker. Keen eyes will spot Paul Dooley and Christopher Guest as uniforms, while Jeff Goldblum utters the immortal line ""I hate rich c...s"" (twice) as he beats on two defenceless women in an auspicious film debut. Way to go, Jeff.There'll be viewers who argue the merits of portraying vigilantes as anti-heroes and the disintegration of social values underpinning law and order, but cut the rhetoric and just enjoy the film for its suspense, thrills, action and engaging narrative.

(R)Self-proclaimed liberal Bronson, who hasn't touched a gun since the Korean War, changes his tune after his wife and daughter are assaulted by a pack of violent crazies, turning into a vigilante who guns down muggers in the mean streets of NYC. Morally dubious (if not occasionally repulsive) action pic based on Brian Garfield's novel changes the prevailing attitude--the book was against vigilantism while the movie is almost always in favor of it--by having its ""hero"" hand down life sentences to street thugs without any sense of regret (just nausea following his first act). Since the terms are so simplistic and based on counter-response emotions, there's no attempt to reasonably argue the philosophy on conflicted terms; as such, its worth (or lack thereof) must be weighed against Winner's hard-hitting treatment of gritty, violent thrillers and Bronson's typically laconic, cold-steel approach.

Classic revenge flick carried by a great performance from Charles Bronson. The film has problems for sure but Charles Bronson's performance more than makes up for it. Death Wish is one of the best revenge films of it's time and is a must see for fans of the genre. The film follows a formulatic narrative arc but is never dull or uninteresting. Charles Bronson certainly delivers here. I'm a huge fan of his work and this ranks up there as one of his best performances",Death Wish
80,Howlin Wolf,About as subtle as a sledgehammer to the kneecaps...,4,11 October 2005,"Where do they get this idea that ordinary middle-class people can't understand violence unless it's portrayed in the most offensively simplistic way possible??! It's a picture-postcard beginning, but all at once the honeymoon's over and we're straight into 'cartoon' territory; complete with 'Pink Panther' music as the villains make their entrance (Well OK, not quite, but it was similar enough to get an unintentional laugh from me... ) Almost immediately after the action kicks in, the message seems to be: ""Don't associate with the 'underclass' on the street, or they might break into your home, turn into complete savages and eat your family""... They forget to mention that moving house on a whim is a privilege only those with money can indulge... There's a 'division', even before we start. If governments spread the wealth a bit more in the first place so that poverty didn't make crime the EASY option; then there wouldn't be as much risk.I'd be interested to know if any fans of the film who are native New Yorkers got at all offended when they heard their city repeatedly described as a ""toilet"", just for the purposes of cheap exploitation? He's the victim of an attempted mugging 4 TIMES in the period covered by one film, alone... If it weren't a fictional construct; you'd be forgiven for thinking that these people had gotten confused, and were just pressing Mr. Bronson for his autograph!

The soundtrack in itself is beautiful, but for the film it often sounds too 'nice'. And even though Bronson looks like a tough guy from the get-go, unlike a homely father who goes through drastic changes, he does a good job. The last bit, Kersey in his new town Chicago making the gun gesture with his hand, was too much. The rest of the referencing to westerns did work for me, illustrating perfectly how our protagonist becomes more and more a gunslinger;Inspector: ""We want you to get out of New York...

82,BrandtSponseller,Charismatic Clunkiness,7,19 July 2006,"There is not much about the first Death Wish film that you could call ""smooth"". The story, although still relatively unusual for 1974, has very transparent politics, made so by a lot of awkward and awkwardly delivered dialogue. Beyond the politics, there's not a lot to the story, really. The performances tend to range from amateurish to generic television-style for that era. The same could be said of the directing, cinematography, and just about everything else.However, for the right audience, there's a lot of charm in the film, and a cheesy clunkiness is part of it. Of course, so is star Charles Bronson, who is not really cheesy or clunky or a bad actor, but just a very strange one by this point in his career, beginning a particular-kind-of-fan cherished path that will consist of very unusual choices for vehicles. ""Unusual"" because he seemed to look for these kinds of cheesy, clunky crime films from this point. Bronson, who looked increasingly odder as time went on, has an almost ineffable anti-hunk charisma. Someone like him would probably never get a role like this if this film were being made today, and he's probably the definition of ""wooden"" as an actor, but a lot of other people and I love him. Just like overacting, I don't think that woodenness is inherently a flaw--it depends on just how someone does it, and Bronson does it with style. Of course, that a guy who looks and acts like Bronson does here chooses the actions that he does in this film is part of what makes it effective--he's not the typical kind of guy to all of a sudden become a tough, near-invincible vigilante.Death Wish is firmly mired in 1974. It plays and looks very dated. New York City in the 1970s had a funky, squalid, crime-ridden, but also charming feel that this film (and lots of others, ranging from Taxi Driver (1976) to Basket Case (1982)) captures very well. I love the production design on Bronson's character's apartment--with its creamsicle-orange walls and trashy silver and ""daisy"" wallpaper.You get to see Jeff Goldblum in his first role, playing what only Broadway might think is a passable ""freak""/punk, and Christopher Guest in one of his earlier roles briefly playing a very middle of the road cop. The music is also worth noting, partially because Herbie Hancock did it and partially because it blends so much into the woodwork that you'd not notice it if the credits didn't tell you it was him.",Death Wish
83,seymourblack-1,A Tabloid-Style Vigilante Thriller,9,15 March 2012,"The most attention grabbing tabloid journalism is sensationalist, forthright and very opinionated and it's these qualities that are used to great effect in ""Death Wish"" to give the movie its immense power and clarity. Its story about vigilante justice is told in a style which is simplistic and forceful and totally eschews any form of subtlety or equivocation. The circumstances which lead to a decent man becoming a vigilante are portrayed in a way which is calculated to provoke a visceral response and in so doing, justify the movie's pro-gun and pro-vigilante agenda. As ""Death Wish"" was made at a time (in the early 1970s) when urban crime was escalating at an alarming rate and the authorities seemed incapable of dealing with the problem, it's easy to understand why these types of views gained some traction.Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson) is a New York City architect whose comfortable middle-class lifestyle is destroyed after a group of hoodlums break into his upmarket apartment and violently attack his wife and daughter. His wife dies from her injuries and his married daughter slips into a catatonic state and has to be institutionalised.Paul's sympathetic employer sends him on a business trip to Tucson, Arizona where he meets a client called Ames Jainchill (Stuart Margolin). Some years earlier, Paul had given up using guns after a hunter has accidentally killed his father but visits to a gun club with Ames and a staged wild west gunfight at a tourist attraction in Old Tucson revives his interest and when he leaves, Ames gives him a .32 revolver as a present.Back in New York City, Paul develops a compulsion to roam the streets at night armed with his revolver and when he's threatened with being assaulted on a series of occasions, he simply shoots his assailants. His actions gain favourable coverage in the media, the city's crime rate plummets and ordinary citizens start to feel more prepared to fight back against the criminals. All this leaves the police with a dilemma because they have a duty to hunt him down and stop his rampage but if they do, the crime rate is likely to soar again.Films that are shocking at the time of their release generally lose some of their impact after a certain number of years. This isn't the case, however, with the scene in ""Death Wish"" where the two women are attacked, as this sequence remains just as harrowing as it ever was.New York City is depicted as an extremely dangerous place and this impression is reinforced by its dark, threatening environment being contrasted strongly with Arizona and Hawaii which are both portrayed as being far more beautiful and salubrious. The fact that, in certain circumstances, a conscientious objector with liberal views can rapidly adopt a diametrically opposite outlook and become a violent killer, also suggests that the veneer of civilisation that most people conform to, is indeed, very thin and fragile.Paul is a man who's quiet and likable and lives in a period of time when men were not encouraged to express their feelings in the way that they are today. His stoicism is typical of what was expected of men in his circumstances and the internalisation of his emotions is reflected very powerfully in Charles Bronson's wonderfully measured performance.",Death Wish
84,blott2319-1,"Not a bad revenge film, but hard to watch nowadays",6,26 May 2021,"Death Wish is one of the earliest down-and-dirty revenge movies that have become extremely popular nowadays. You have to wonder if there would be franchises like Taken, The Punisher, or even John Wick, if Charles Bronson didn't do it first. I can certainly see why this movie was popular at the time and even spawned some sequels and a remake. The film does a good job of making you sympathize with the main character, and you find yourself longing to see him fight to clean up the streets after what was done to his family. I think Charles Bronson was good casting as well, because he has a strong-but-silent demeanor that works for this character. There is a point in the movie where you start to think he might be taking things too far and has forgotten why he started it all, but I think the film-makers know that and are intentionally taking the audience there to question the morality of vigilante justice.This is a movie that I would have latched onto quite a bit if I saw it when I was younger. It has a number of things that would have connected to the more visceral side of my teenage brain. However, watching it now might not have been the best thing. There are a lot of things going on in the news that sour me on any hero that is gunning people down. It becomes particularly problematic when it is a white man killing black youths. I did a reasonable job of switching off that part of my brain, and just taking the movie for what it was, but there was certainly something nagging at the back of my mind the whole time I watched. It's also worth mentioning that the movie doesn't exactly have a satisfying conclusion, since the punks involved in the inciting incident were never dealt with properly. That being said, I still appreciate what Death Wish is doing, and I can see that it is a decent film. I just don't know if I'll be rushing to watch it again.",Death Wish

Death Wish came out when I was still a baby so I unfortunately missed it in theaters and it wasn't until I saw Death Wish 3 that I had any interest to watch the series and was indeed surprised at just how intense and well made this movie was. Indeed the movie is not unlike The Terminator in it's impact. It features a brutal pace and action sequences which border on the frighteningly intense. Bronson is of course in great form and he pulls off the part with a performance of such change that you would indeed be surprised in comparing this performance to his non-acting in the subsequent entries.

86,TOMASBBloodhound,"A ""statistic"" decides to fight back.",9,30 March 2008,"This is a monumental film dealing with one man's revenge after muggers murder his wife and leave his daughter in a vegetative state. Many people over the years have foolishly stated that this film somehow owes its existence to the presidency of Richard Nixon and his ""silent majority"". Truth be told, this is just a film about an honest guy who suffers a great loss and decides to seek revenge. The film definitely has a political ax to grind, as it is pointed out that the main character is a ""liberal"", but crime is really not a political issue. Crime is a battle between good and evil. Even the most left-leaning members of the ACLU can be victims of the lost souls they claim to champion, just as readily as conservative waspy folks. Criminals don't often seem to care who their victims are in terms of race, creed, or color. Muggers like the ones depicted in Death Wish seem to be financially motivated more than anything else. Even the three that torment Kersey's family first ask for money before moving on to the more sadistic acts that they commit. Many of these types of muggers are looking for money to support their drug habits, and all the vigilante action in the world would not stop them from looking to take down their victims. Anyway, enough pontification for now. Let's look more closely at the film....Charles Bronson, in his seminal role, plays mild-mannered architect Paul Kersey. He and his wife are barely back from their trip to Hawai'i when she and their daughter are attacked in their apartment by three ugly hoodlums. (one of them is Jeff Goldblum!) Kersey has always been somewhat of a pacifist, even serving as a conscientious objector during the Korean War. On a business trip to Arizona, the still grieving Kersey is re-introduced to firearms by a colleague. The man even slips one into his luggage as a gift. Once back in NYC, Kersey decides the best way to get over his grief is to use that little .32 on anyone who dares accost him on the streets after dark. Apparently, you can get mugged very easily at night in NYC, as there is no shortage of muggers who line up to shake him down. Kersey is a pretty good shot, and the bodies of muggers begin to pile up. The police are faced with a tough dilemma. They know it is their job to catch the vigilante, but his work is also having a dramatic impact on crime rates. It seems muggers are a little more reluctant in the wake of Paul's revenge. If Paul is brought to justice, he will be a martyr, and crime rates will shoot back up. The conclusion is a bit hard to believe, and certainly would not happen in this day and age. A white man who kills mostly minorities for any reason would likely be the scourge of the media now. Just ask Bernard Goetz.Though unrealistic, Michael winner has created a very good film. It looks good and is far more intelligent than the exploitative sequels it spawned. Those films, particularly part 3, can be fun but they are nothing as polished as the original. There is real emotion in this one, and the acting is top-drawer for the most part. The shootouts look somewhat realistic, and the city looks foreboding and sinister. Especially in one scene where Kersey steps out onto the balcony of a cocktail party and looks across the Manhattan skyline. What a shot! And Herbie Hancock's urban 70s style score hits all the right notes. Maybe this is just a law-abiding citizen's bloody fantasy, but it makes for some very interesting viewing. It's best if you try and ignore the politics, though. Crime hurts everyone.... not just whites the elite. 9 of 10 stars.The Hound.",Death Wish

A conscientious objector becomes a vigilante after his wife and daughter are assaulted in their home.Death Wish is a basic movie. The plot of this movie is more of a vehicle for the audience to see Charles Bronson's vigilante character in Paul Kersey. The movie does do a good job in the presentation of Paul Kersey, however the movie does not expand too much. The movie relies on shock value to become memorable. This does not stick too well as the movie only has these scenes and nothing else. There are absolutely uncomfortable scenes in this movie. However, the movie fails to expand upon it.The movie falls entirely on Charles Bronson. He is successful in the role however, the movie cannot move past the focus on Paul Kersey.

This film was most likely the inspiration for the comic book character named The Punisher. Having talent like Charles Bronson and Vincent Gardenia certainly didn't hurt the film any either..I found it surprisingly engaging.",Death Wish

His wife dead and his daughter reduced to a catatonic wreck, Bronson is shipped to Arizona for a business arrangement. His client is a basic modern-day cowboy, a Southern boy with a penchant for big properties, back-slappin' --- and guns.Bronson is introduced to his first firearm in years. You see, he was a conscientious objecter in the Korean war, another fascinating character trait of Bronson's Kersey. (For you kids out there, a CO was someone opposed to war combat, but still performed other duties, such as Bronson's character being a medic.) Upon returning to New York, a compulsion comes over Bronson after his sort of ""awakening"" with the cowboy. In the ensuing days, he takes to the streets at night, grocery bag as a lure, and begins plugging would-be assailants. His nearly-mute daughter unable to identify her attackers, Bronson is left to stalk the streets and make a statement rather than seek revenge, capping whomever approaches him.Director Michael Winner's result was a timely and culturally pleasing comment on the good guys vs. the bad guys. There's even a somewhat archaic reference to that Old West feel near the end of the film, when a dazed and wounded Bronson asks a modern-day street thug to ""draw"". Compelling moment. Plus a completely unpredictable reaction aftermath to Bronson's first victim. Charlie's performance overall is abundantly subdued, but he did manage the incredible once-in-a-lifetime feat for an actor: becoming a movie-star sensation in his 50s.""Death Wish"" isn't a perfect film, the set-up dragging listlessly to its middle, and the shooting becoming painfully repetitive (Bronson turns, gun in pocket, blam!, ad naseum). As well as Gardenia's grizzled, store-bought, weezing, sneezing, cigar barking (are we out of cliché's yet??) detective slightly annoying at times. And even for a 1974 film, the initial household attack can still be too much for some to stomach.We try as best we can not to review an older film in the present day, but it becomes nearly impossible. So it must be said that ""Death Wish"" hasn't aged horribly, but is a bit outdated in spots. Has that overly crisp, narrow look to it, plus stiff acting in spots, with that annoying ""sounds dubbed"" dialogue of the early 70s.But Bronson, in his patented understated fashion, wipes all that nearly out with a legendary debut as Paul Kersey.",Death Wish
93,Cinemaniac1984,The definitive vigilante movie.,8,18 November 2016,"Death Wish works on a simple plot which works a treat to audiences. The polarizing Charles Bronson who audiences either like or dislike has never been finer. Before the days of Steven Seagal and Sylvester Stallone, and before movies such as Kill Bill (2003), Taken (2008) and The Equalizer (2014), Death Wish has always been the definitive vigilante movie.Mild mannered bleeding heart architect Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson) who lives a peaceful life in New York City. Paul's world is devastatingly shattered when his wife Joanna (Hope Lange) and daughter Carol Anne (Kathleen Tolan) are attacked by a trio of thugs (one of whom is played by Jeff Goldblum). Carol is raped and Joanna is brutally beaten. In the aftermath, Carol is left in a catatonic state and Joanna has died. Carol's husband and Paul's son-in-law Jack Toby (Steven Keats) tries to support Paul as well as he can, however despite his good intentions he presence does more harm than good as his efforts are futile. The New York Police Department concede that there is a small chance of catching the thugs responsible for the attack and bringing them to justice. Following a business trip to Tuscon, Arizona Paul is given a nickel plated .32 revolver as a gift from a client. With his .32 revolver, Paul Kersey wages a one man war against street crime in New York by stopping thugs in their tracks, literally. While the public view this mysterious vigilante as a hero, the police led by Inspector Frank Ochoa (Vincent Gardenia) wants to uncover the identity of the mysterious vigilante.Although popular with audiences when released in 1974, Death Wish divided many critics with some saying it was an excellent movie and others dismissing it as violently one-dimensional. Charles Bronson experienced a boost in his popularity and saw him headlining a string of movies over the next 20 years running along a similar theme which saw many of his movies either being dismissed as more of the same old theme. These also included a further 4 sequels to the Death Wish series, each gradually declining in quality as the series went on. Charles Bronson was unapologetic in admitting that he just did the sequels purely for the money.Ignoring the rest of the sequels, Death Wish is still the definitive vigilante movie. Uncompromisingly violent while realistically exploring the theme of whether law and order works in modern society, Death Wish started the trend of having the central character take the law into his own hands as judge, jury and executioner.8/10.",Death Wish

Someone close to the heroic character is killed, hero goes out for revenge.However, there is plot here. There is also character development (for some characters anyway). It just doesn't take long for the movie to go down the famous path of hero becoming a vigilante.Charles Bronson was obviously the best choice to play Paul Kersey, the war veteran with a family who is happy with his life until disaster strikes. Stuart Margolin plays Ames Jainchill, Kersey's new found cowboy friend who introduces him to the world of carrying a gun outside of the war. Hope Lange plays Joanna, Paul's wife. Vincent Gardenia plays Detective Frank Ochoa, the detective who is sent out to find Kersey. I guess the rest of the characters aren't really worth mentioning except for an early appearance by Jeff Goldblum, who actually plays his part very well.The New York setting was very good, the wintry climate gave it all the more realism as to how cold the world really is. The music score was also really good.Bronson was definitely the main reason to keep watching. The part was seemingly written for him.Over all, not a bad movie.

Unlike the new Eli Roth remake the original builds up Paul Kersey's (Bronson) transition into a normal family man to mugger killer in a more realistic manner, actually allowing time for some build up. Hell, Bronson never even kills his families original perpetrators. The rape and violence is still rather hard to watch and even though it's far from the series worst it's still head turning at times. Winner and Bronson are a winning combination and it's easy to see why they continued to work together far into the 1980's.

98,gary-444,"A nasty, shallow, base film.",4,27 February 2010,"I saw this, on release, 36 years ago. Time has not been particularly kind to it, with Director Michael Winner's career having been ultimately defined by this work. It was about the first, and certainly the most prominent, modern Revenge story transplanting a formula which was well worn in Western Films into an Urban setting.It neatly tapped into justified contemporary fears that some major cities, particularly in America, were degenerating into lawless cesspits. Furthermore , sexual mores were loosening with the widespread success of Pornographic Movie blockbuster ""Deep Throat"" relaxing public attitudes to what sexual content was acceptable on screen. The ten minute rape scene is still amongst the most harrowing in mainstream cinema, and is there to shamelessly attract the voyeuristic as is the frequent violence.Where the movie succeeded was in tapping into the prevailing zeitgeist that some cities were spiralling out of control ""and something needed to be done"", whilst delivering a level of physical and sexual violence as entertainment which was at the bounds of what was permitted purely to attract an audience. No doubt this irony was lost on the makers. It also explored the mob ""eye for an eye"" ethos, as confidence in the authorities waned ( the Vietnam War was limping to a humiliating ending for the United States).It fails because the acting is poor and the story clunky in the extreme. Winner is not a good Director. He is an upper class aesthete who thinks that he is pandering to the ""mobs"" taste by presenting the film in the way he does. But crucially he does not like people and lacks the common touch. In the equally violent ""Dirty Harry"" series Director Don Siegel and lead actor Clint Eastwood wade through a similar body count, but succeed. Why? Because the characters feel real. Winner simply uses characters as a means to deliver a product.That frequent and graphic revenge violence and a graphic rape are big pulls for many is confirmed by the commercial success of ""Death Wish"" and the subsequent three sequels. But beyond that there is nothing. Charles Bronson, as Paul Kersey, shoots people, and that is about it. Hope Lang, as Joanna Kersey is shown in her nightwear, and then being beaten to death. Their daughter, played by Kathleen Tolan is the rape victim, and that is your lot for women in this picture, a misogyny which is a trademark both of Winner as a persona and a film Director.That the three assailants themselves get away, whilst sundry other bad guys ""get it"", is an attempt at some form of deliberate moral ambiguity to temper the natural audience enthusiasm for Paul Kersey's actions. But it is no device to question his actions, more a vehicle for saying that all bad guys ""deserve it"" anyway.A nasty, shallow, base film.",Death Wish

It is not nice to watch some of the scenes, even today it is a very violent movie, and I kept thinking about some of the real events of the 1970s while watching it.

101,Coffee_in_the_Clink,"Savage and uncompromising. Bronson is superb, dispatching the scum with cool precision",9,25 March 2020,"Winner brings a grim, crime-ridden New York City to life in this archetypal revenge film, that is borderline exploitative. The city itself is a character; we venture down the backstreets and undergrounds of the city and are treated to some fine skyline shots. Just like the way ""The Warriors"" can be viewed now, ""Death Wish"" is a 1970s time machine that lets us absorb the physicality of New York City. Charles Bronson in arguably his most famous role is Paul Kersey, a successful architect who lives a modest life in a nice apartment in a bad city. At the beginning of the film he is just back from a nice holiday in Hawaii with his wife. They have one daughter who is married. New York is a crime-ridden city at this time, epitomised by the stat that Kersey receives the day that he returns to work from a colleague. In his absence, there were some twenty murders committed in the city. That same day, Kersey's wife and daughter are attacked in the apartment by three hoodlums who follow them home. They burgle the apartment and sexually assault the daughter. Kersey's wife receives a few blows to the head and later dies from her injuries, and the daughter is left severely traumatised. Kersey becomes a self-appointed avenger, armed with a gun, he walks the bad streets and lures out the scum, dispatching them with cold precision and becoming something of a hero in the city.Charles Bronson was in his early fifties when he starred in this and had already been in iconic films alongside Steve McQueen in ""The Great Escape"" and in Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" alongside Henry Fonda. So it's interesting to note, that at this age and with such a CV behind him, that ""Death Wish"" would become something of a breakthrough role for him, in the sense that the role snared him and he would never shake the vigilante, blowing-away-the-bad-guys role after this. Without a doubt an inspiration for Scorcese's ""Taxi Driver"" and many others, ""Death Wish"" is a superb film that caused quite a stir upon its initial release, with many critics seeing it as being an advocate for vigilante justice. I have to agree with them, but I don't view it as a negative. I am guilty of cheering on Kersey and enjoying him killing the scum. He is a hero. And Bronson is superb.

Kersey decides to take matters into his hands and becomes a vigilante, who ventures out onto the dark and bleak streets of New York City with a loaded silver thirty-two pistol in hand.

The performances are strong all around besides Bronson himself (Vincent Gardenia, Hope Lange, Steven Keats, Stuart Margolin, etc.).

103,OldAle1,"More even-handed than you might remember, but still a vengeance pic to the core",8,20 January 2009,"I'd seen bits and pieces of this over the years, but never the whole thing straight through. Bronson is Paul Kersey, a successful New York architect in a happy marriage, with a son and daughter-in-law. Right away the film telegraphs its POV about violence, when one of Kersey's coworkers calls him a knee-jerk liberal and, knowing it's a Bronson film, we can see that an awakening is about to happen.For those who don't know the story, I'll make it brief. Kersey's wife and daughter-in-law are viciously attacked by a trio of hoodlums (including a young Jeff Goldblum) in Kersey's apartment; his wife dies and the daughter-in-law is left so emotionally scarred that she never recovers and ends up in a sanitarium. In the early scenes, before and after the attack, we see a crime-infested New York where violence is casual, everyday, all over - and a police force that is powerless. Bronson undergoes a slow metamorphosis - to the credit of the film, he clearly has doubts about what he's doing - as he decides to take the law into his own hands upon finding that the cops can't do anything. Interestingly, he never really speaks out against the police though his son more than once says ""nobody can do anything."" At first he just puts some rolled-up quarters in a sock and carries it with him as insurance, at one point fighting off an attempted mugging - but after a lengthy trip to Tucson where he makes friends with a client who turns out to be a gun collector, he decides to arm himself seriously, and a one man (and five movie) war on crime begins...This got lambasted by liberal film critics when it came out, of course, just as Dirty Harry had three years previously, but what's interesting about it today is how low-key the attacks on liberal values are, and in fact the film really doesn't go after anything except on-the-street violence. Of course it completely ignores class and race issues, except for one brief comment where somebody at a party mentions that there are more black criminals than white - it basically just treats all ""criminals"" as scum who enjoy preying on their victims. It does get a bit more disturbing as it goes along, and we see Kersey acting first, deliberately getting himself into situations where he might be in danger, and then blowing people away before they even have a chance to go at him. No question that the morality here is decided skewed to the right, but as I say, not so much as you might expect given its reputation. Probably the most extreme part is at the very end, when the rather sympathetic police detective (Vincent Gardenia) who's been in charge of hunting down ""the vigilante"" lets Kersey go - but given the vision of the city this film gives us, this isn't really unexpected.The film-making though is quite solid; one thing Winner can do is propel a story forward, with very little in the way of needless exposition or explanation. The New York locations are well used, and Bronson is...Bronson. Great music by Herbie Hancock.",Death Wish

The film is well structured, the action scenes are simple and realistic, and the story itself questions the morality of such justice, while at the same time showing the reasons why it happened.The film is superbly directed, with subtle details at every turn and possesses timeless quality.Truly an immortal classic that has earned its place in the history of film art.",Death Wish
106,jonathanruano,Death Wish,5,21 September 2010,"When I saw Michael Winner's Death Wish, I expected a great movie. But really the film seems too basic, too skin deep and too ordinary to me. Cursey (Charles Bronson)'s wife and daughter are killed in a mugging and I expected that he would try to find who the muggers were and kill them. Instead, Cursey does what any lazy vigilante would do which is to look for trouble and shoot down muggers. I think the problem with this movie is that it is too simple. Anyone can walk into the wrong neighborhood late at night and find muggers (killing them is less simple, unless you happen to be a typical action hero of the Bronson mold), but it is much harder intellectually to track those specific muggers that have killed one's wife and children. So by making a movie about someone who truly has a death wish, Director Michael Winner is taking away the fascination that one usually gets from watching the careful unfolding of a intricate murder mystery and revenge fantasy. Just take the film, ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,"" and you will see what I mean. I do not want to undersell this film though. There are some things to like about it - just not enough to recommend it.",Death Wish
107,happyendingrocks,A better drama than an action movie,7,4 April 2011,"It's hard to effectively gauge the quality of Death Wish by today's standards, since far superior revenge flicks have been made since this humble entry's release. However, perhaps remarkably, the heart of the film holds up admirably well, and while I don't consider Charles Bronson's most iconic offering a genuine classic, its grittiness still packs quite a punch.Every good revenge film needs a powerful motivating event, and Death Wish certainly delivers on that front. The rape scene, in which Bronson's wife and daughter are unspeakably brutalized, remains a shocking and haunting bit of degradation that is graphic enough to be a vividly displayed and truly horrifying set-piece, yet doesn't play out as gratuitous. What happens in that apartment is an abomination, and it is more than sufficient visual stimulation for us to then root on Bronson as he wages his one-man war on crime.However, the savages who ultimately murder Bronson's wife and render his daughter a basket case disappear from the film after this shocking violation, so in the end we are not offered pathos for the despicable act. Perhaps it would be skirting credibility if Bronson somehow tracked down the impetuses for his killing spree amidst a city of millions, but since we are forced to suspend our disbelief for much of the ensuing occurrences, it seems strange that the film-makers didn't want to fulfill the implied promise of Bronson bringing his family's tormentors to justice. Instead, we see Bronson enact his wrath upon a series of interchangeable stand-in muggers and thugs, which, while this suitably climaxes the dramatic arc of his character, renders the series of shootouts he ultimately embroils himself in rather meaningless.The most effective aspects of the film are the psychological explorations of both Bronson's everyman and of the public at large, who latch on to his murderous exploits as heroic displays of courage since he only kills ""bad guys"". Bronson's performance is actually quite excellent, and his transformation from grieving family man to instrument of vengeance plays out in a natural and satisfying manner. His very normalcy here strengthens the impact of his deeds, and unlike the unstoppable archetype of the forthcoming 80's action hero (who Bronson would more closely resemble in the Death Wish sequels), our protagonist in this original can be wounded and stymied during the course of his nocturnal missions, which heightens the realism of the film.More problematic is Bronson's essential abandonment of his daughter after she is institutionalized later in the movie. The way her character is ultimately pushed onto the sidelines muddles the original ""go get 'em"" spirit the film encourages us to foster, and it gets increasingly hard to root for a hero who becomes so lost in his own quest that he neglects the traumatized daughter whose tragedy launched him into it. The final resolution, which finds Bronson starting anew in another city, doesn't end the film on a high note, despite the little wink he throws at the audience. Death Wish expects us by this point to be so callous that we embrace the idea of Bronson basically severing all ties to his child, which is a dicey proposition considering the moralistic themes the film sets forth at its core.The action sequences play out a bit rote after a few repetitions, but still hold up fairly well. The scummy urban locales help immeasurably in heightening the impact of Bronson's solitary sentry; the New York in Death Wish is presented as a dirty city that needs to be cleaned, and the film-makers indelibly capture the seedier side of the locale. Revisiting the film today, I couldn't help but think that the New York Board Of Tourism must have been horrified by the way the Big Apple is portrayed in the film. After all, every single time Bronson leaves his house at night, someone tries to rob or kill him.Overall, Death Wish is squarely a product of its time, and as an action vehicle, it isn't likely to please fans of the modern mode of CGI-laden car chases and explosions. However, those looking for a thoughtful film about real-life horrors and how ordinary people cope with them will find a lot to chew on here. Viewers in the middle of those two camps have seen this material handled better since Death Wish, but there's no denying that the blueprint here is still being referenced today. In the end, this is a very good, not great, film, but still highly recommended.",Death Wish

As a native New Yorker, I can attest to this. The merits of Bronson's vigilantism depend on your point of view. If police are unable to control crime, an alternate solution is needed. Back in 1974, some theater audiences cheered every time Bronson blew some dirtbag away. I'm with the people who cheered. Some interesting casting here. Hope Lange as Bronson's wife (though her role is much too small). Jeff Goldblum as one of the three punks. My favorite is Maria (from Sesame Street!) as the cashier who says: $2.17.

Here we have the story of a man named Paul Kersey, an architect and has many liberal views on the world. When he and his wife come back from vacation his whole life is turned upside down. After his wife and daughter leave a grocery store near their home, three hoods follow them and rape his daughter and murder his wife. This sparks something in Paul. After noticing that the police were doing nothing to find the hoods who committed this crime, Paul takes the law into his own hands and becomes a vigilante.I really enjoyed this movie. Charles Bronson is always a lot of fun to watch even if it seems that he doesn't put a lot of emotion into his acting. Vincent Gardenia plays the detective who is out to stop the vigilante crimes and he also plays his part well, as always. We even get to see a very young Jeff Goldblum near the beginning of the movie playing one of the hoods.What makes Death Wish such a fun movie to watch is simply seeing Paul Kersey taking the law into his own hands. You really end up cheering him on. He is better then any other fictional type of vigilante because he seems like a really human being. He doesn't run around in a Bat suit or has to cover his identity. He is almost the all American man who has just taken enough of sitting around and feels compelled to do something about the crime all around him.Unfortunately, other then the second Death Wish movie, the rest of them are just jokes. They take away from the seriousness of what this movie was meant to be. Not to say that they aren't enjoyable, if you like seeing Charles Bronson blow people away with bazooka's and take on the mob and what not.If you like this movie you should check out Falling Down.

There he shoots a gun or two and on his way home he gets a present from Jainchill,a gun. Back in the Big Apple Paul wants to get even with the muggers and goes on a crusade in New York at Night. He kills muggers in Riverside Park,in an alley,in a subway train and at 8th avenue station. In the Meanwhile inspector Ochoa(Vincent Gardenia) tries to catch this mysterious Vigilante. In the end he catches Paul and orders him to leave NYC.Although the moral of the story is not my way of thinking and although the end is pretty psycho(let Paul loose in another city),it is a very good movie about New York in the 70's. The shots of 1970's New York at Night are beautiful and Charles Bronson gives away a fine performance as an innocent man who becomes a killer.My favorite part about the movie is the soundtrack by Herbie Hancock. each scene has it's own score and doesn't look alike. The rape scene has a dramatic almost horror score while the scenes of Night New York are very quiet and gloomyA shame is that Charles Bronson got a stigma on playing a Vigilante(4 sequels,from which only part 3 is not bad. The others suck.). In the end Death Wish is one of those very good movies that where made in that period,don't look at it from a political point of view but from a movie watching point of view. Then it will good evening entertainment! 9/10",Death Wish
114,ctowyi,The Original Vigilante Movie,7,26 May 2015,"Death Wish is a vigilante classic that always gets a hearty mention when a new vigilante thriller like John Wick appears, but surprisingly I have yet to see it even if I seem to 'know' the movie like an old friend. The story is simple - Paul Kesey's wife died and his daughter traumatized by a savage home invasion by hoodlums. The man then becomes the judge, jury and executioner of a seedy New York City overrun by gangsters and thieves, becoming a hero for the city's citizens and the bane of NYC's police force. All the featured hoodlums overact (watch a young Jeff Goldblum do the crazy) and they are all painted in broad strokes. The movie glorifies violence to the Ying Yang and the solution is overly simplified for a hot-button issue, but I can't help myself from enjoying every minute of it. One of the things the movie does very well is how it paints Charles Bronson's character arc. His motivation and learning curve are slowly defined to amazing lucidity. The film also plays to Bronson's strength as a taciturn man with few words. I also enjoyed the cat and mouse game in the last act. One interesting thought at the back of mine is that the film somehow feels like it was suggesting that owning a gun is a symbol of manhood and all problems in the world can be solved by one (or a few ). I know that feeling - I shot a revolver before back in the days and it is damn 'man'!",Death Wish
115,adrian-43767,"Gripping and manipulative, but eminently possible",8,5 August 2017,"This is a standard 1970s production. The script is adequate, the action credible, and photography unimaginative but effective within the framework of the film's aims. Bronson, an actor of limited range, has in this role probably his finest hour, playing the aggrieved law-abiding citizen who sees no justice done and decides to act as vigilante, until it becomes addictive. One very positive point about this movie is that it neither judges nor moralizes, it just presents situations involving a man increasingly enjoying thwarting and killing criminals, and increasingly unable to turn off the habit. It is no surprise to learn that Goetz had seen this film several times before he shot and wounded four would-be attackers on the metro in New York a few years later. DEATH WISH is manipulative, but also persuasive, in its handling of the subject matter, but it does so with enough style to hold the whole thing together and make viewing a compelling, and at times even enjoyable, experience - leaving the viewer to decide on all the moral issues. Definitely worth 8/10.",Death Wish
116,refinedsugar,Divine Retribution,8,8 March 2001,"Death Wish is a movie that works because of it's simplicity. It's theme is timeless. It's a tale of taking the law into your own hands and distributing ""justice"" where one sees fit. Charles Bronson stars as Paul Kersey, a man who resorts to an act of violence after punks break into his house and his wife is killed and daughter mentally traumatized. It's here in what starts as an act of simple revenge that Kersey's pain and anguish turns into an almost personal crusade against bad people who inflict suffering on others.In no small way it's success lies deeper than it's universal theme. For one, Bronson is able to carry the role of the caring all-too-human father well. Secondly you can't help but like him, sympathize with him, even route for him as he carries out murder in plain sight numerous times. It's this way the movie and the vigilante genre has always been manipulative. However since the people he takes out are set up and shown to be supreme wastes of life the point of precious human life becomes moot. It throws you the suggestion that what Kersey's doing may be right. It never dives into a discussion on the subject, but the theme is there. I don't condone killing especially for revenge, but again, that is of little coincidence when the people he blows away are such vile trash and the whole thing is just a movie after all.Death Wish works primarily because it's good entertainment and because people can relate to Kersey's actions in a world so screwed up and misguided. It allows for a short window of escape for the viewer and that's what movies are all about. It's very manipulative, but it works as entertainment, if not an inside look into the darker recesses of the human mind too. Imitated, but never duplicated, Death Wish is amongst Bronson's best work. An instant classic of it's time, today and maybe for the foreseeable future. Tread lightly when it comes to the sequels, but the original is a highly recommended watch.",Death Wish
117,Renaldo Matlin,Bronson dead on target in chilling classic,10,9 September 2003,"The first ""Death Wish""-film is truly a rare cinematic masterpiece in audience manipulation.It starts with a harrowing account of the murder of Bronson's wife, and the rape of his daughter. Later, when he starts turning vigilante we are - like Bronson's character - shocked over what he's doing, but as he start to enjoy his vigilante-mission we too find us caring less about his victims, and basically supports him even when he starts to SEARCH out trouble, like sitting on the first car of a subway-train (everyone in New York knows you're not supposed to ride the first, or the last car of a subway if you wanna' avoid trouble) and just waiting for trouble to show up, so he can blow it away with his shiny new revolver.It's disturbing, more so because it is delivered with strong conviction and solid film-making, with Bronson showing once again what an underrated actor he... was. He will be sadly missed.Everybody who likes to cut down on the ""Death Wish""-series without having seen the original most surely will be (positively) surprised over the complexity and credibility that went into describing the character of Paul Kersey first time around. This was no ordinary movie-Rambo, but a realistic account of a family-man pushed over the edge.And you gotta love that final shot of Bronson before the end-credits!",Death Wish
118,shaun98,Highly compelling,7,9 February 2003,"Over the course of a career that has spanned nearly fifty years, action star Charles Bronson has appeared in dozens of films. Among them, the one that he is best remembered for is ""Death Wish,"" an urban drama that has practically defined his career. He plays Paul Kersey, a liberal, mild-mannered architect whose family falls victim to violent crime. One fateful afternoon, he is shocked to hear the dreadful news: his wife has been murdered, his daughter brutally raped. What's more, the police are unable to apprehend the perpetuators. Feeling stunned and helpless, Kersey decides to take the law into his own hands--and the subsequent publicity galvanizes New York City. It isn't long before the police are hot on his heels. The ultimate consequences promise to be drastic.""Death Wish"" was a highly controversial film when initially released. At the time, major cities were facing a deadly crime epidemic, and this film tapped into the fears and unspoken desires of many viewers, giving them a chance to live out their secret fantasies. Critics on the Left lambasted its politics on crime, and even some on the Right felt it went too far. One could find much to complain about from an ideological standpoint. One could point out that the film is manipulative and heavy-handed (the attack on Kersey's family comes right after his co-worker tells him he's a ""bleeding-heart liberal""). Yet, it is undeniably compelling; one of these movies that makes you wonder, ""what if this happened to me?"" In light of the later, inferior sequels, it is fascinating to see how the character came to be, how he made the transition from law-abiding man to cold-blooded vigilante. It is not an easy transition to make by any means--after his first kill, he breaks down and vomits the moment he reaches home. Yet, as his kills (each is very suspensefully handled) occur with greater frequency, we get the sinking feeling that he has reached a point of no return. Indeed, he narrowly eludes capture on at least two occasions, and there is the certainty that it is only a matter of time before the law will catch up with him.Bronson is highly effective here; while not one of the great actors, he has a very strong screen presence. The audience is on his side every step of the way, rooting for him even as he strays onto the wrong side of the law. Surely, he is entitled to justice, but at what point does his vengeance outweigh his grievances? Vincent Gardenia is effective as the police detective assigned to his case. He grudgingly admires Kersey's resolve, although he is sworn to put a stop to the killings. The manner in which this is resolved is creative, though its plausibility is less than certain. The film is also noticeable for an early appearance by Jeff Goldblum as a slimy thug. However, Steven Keats is somewhat ineffectual as Bronson's son-in-law (he just sorta got on my nerves). In the years to come, this film would be followed by an endless chain of sequels and rip-offs, many of them starring Bronson himself, reducing him to a stock character whose only attribute was blowing the bad guys away. A shame, considering he was once an internationally respected actor. ""Death Wish"" is nonetheless a well-crafted, tightly paced crime drama, despite some dated aspects. It still kept me interested throughout and made me more interested in viewing more of the star's other films--good or otherwise.Rating: *** (out of ****)Released by Paramount Pictures",Death Wish
119,mr_pivac1985,Superb,10,25 April 2011,"This was an EXCELLENT revenge film, that i really enjoyed!. Charles Bronson was awesome here and this movie had a lot of disturbing moments, especially near the beginning when his wife gets her head kicked in and his daughter gets raped, and i loved the ending it left me with a huge grin on my face!.The plot is fairly simple and the characters are typical (but at least were very interesting but the script was excellent and the characters were as i said very interesting. The directing was fantastic!. Michael Winner did a fantastic job here moving it along at a very fast pace especially during the night scenes it made for some creepy atmosphere, and he did a lot of cool camera shots!. There is a bit of violence. we get quite a few bloody gunshot wounds, a couple of harsh somewhat bloody beatings, rape, big bloody wound on someone's shoulder and some somewhat bloody surgical gore. The acting was GREAT!. Charles Bronson was absolutely fantastic in the lead role, he kicked that ass, and i felt very sorry for his character after all his wife gets beaten to death and his daughter gets raped!, he did a wonderful job!.Hope Lange was only on screen for a few minutes but she was great when she was and appeared to have good chemistry with Bronson!. Steven Keats does okay as Kersey's son but didn't have much to do. Kathleen Tolan didn't have much to do but act shocked throughout the film. Overall this is an EXCELLENT revenge film that i HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend!",Death Wish
120,wandereramor,They've got a wish... for death!,6,5 November 2012,"Take any right-wing vigilante action movie -- they've existed more or less as long as cinema, but they especially proliferated in the 80s -- and scratch off all of the bells and whistles and what you eventually get will be something like Death Wish. Death Wish is the formula which all of these films rely on: understanding and liberal policy gets nowhere, so what's needed is hard violence directed by the right people at the odiously evil criminal class.What's notable about Death Wish is how dressed-down it is: Charles Bronson has a weird charisma that largely powers the film, but overall he's just an ordinary guy with a shotgun, and his opponents are an endless array of forgettable thugs. The violence is tame from a contemporary perspective, clean and almost easy, with the exception of one early scene (featuring a young Jeff Goldblum as Freak #1!) The only thing that really seems hyperbolic is the setting, a supposedly contemporary dystopian New York where it seems as though any upstanding citizen gets mugged five times a week.Aesthetically, Death Wish is a mix between the grindhouse and New Hollywood, with its pacing a good deal more cerebral than your usual shoot-'em'-up. I'm not sure if that makes it a better film, given that these are thoughts that are rather silly when presented straight-up. It has a weird sort of charm, especially as a curio of exploitation cinema, and that charm is almost enough to get you to forget how reprehensible the film itself is. Almost.",Death Wish

It's compelling and fun to watch, but it hasn't aged well. The villains he shoots are too cartoonish, and there's a cardboard quality to the whole affair, which seems very dated.  The worst part is that this movie spawned FOUR sequels, two of which I've unfortunately seen.  Still, it will always be the movie he's remembered for, so on that level, it's worth seeing.  6 out of 10.",Death Wish

The endless sequels should pretty much rule out any serious person taking it too seriously. My only reason for weighing in here is to note what only one other poster does: the truly ghastly nature of the rape scene, which I found truly upsetting when I viewed this film as an adolescent. I wonder if it would cause anyone to have the same reaction today.It might have been that this came out right after ""Deliverance"" and the idea was too see how far one could get away with pushing these things. Still, to this day, it is to my mind still the ugliest ten minutes or so from any major studio release. I can't believe Hope Lang, not an unknown actress; took the part knowing what She was in for or didn't walk off the set. Jeff Goldblum, as far as I know, never talks about it; and tends to list his walk on in ""California Split"" as his first film. SMART MOVE.",Death Wish
123,CihanVercan,How Michael Winner and his Death Wish changed the outlook of the Crime genre,8,15 February 2009,"One of the best favorite action movies of all time, Death Wish glitters Charles Bronson's glory famously. Followed by 4 script-free episodes the first episode had inspired millions worldwide. At present(2009) while the remake version is being filmed I have to say that; no matter who will perform Paul Kersey for the second time, he won't be able to impress us as Bronson did.Rather than Bronson's performance Death Wish has its significant themes and screenplay components which were used at almost every action/crime movie later on, thus became clichés of their genre. Spending a lot of the running time through the bad guys' side is the most fundamental component. This development was so modern and original, after a while it changed the outlook of the Crime genre. Death Wish is nearly as good as Eastwood's Dirty Harry, with just a different taste. Obviously, this should have been produced only once; since the sequels misrepresented its purpose.",Death Wish
124,metalrox_2000,Action and melodramatic masterpiece,10,24 June 2010,"Death Wish is just one of those films that simply changed forever the genre. You knew what Paul Kersey was doing was wrong, yet you cheered him. For a nation that was coming off the turbulent 1960's and a war that divided the nation, one could argue that Death Wish serves as a metaphor for the countries anger.The story starts off nice and calm. Paul and his wife are enjoying a vacation,away from the New York Streets. It's a peaceful setting, and you can see the love that these two share for each other.They soon return home to New York, and their daughter Carol, and her husband. A simple trip to the grocery store brings Carol and Joanna into the clutches of a ruthless group of thugs, led by a young Jeff Goldbloom in one of his first ever roles.Posing a grocery store delivery boys, the groups makes their way into the apartment. Carol is violently raped, while Joanna is beaten to death.The lives of Jack and Paul are throw into a mess. Joanna is dead, and Carol is soon confined to a mental institute. Whereas Jack is ready to just ""cut and Run"" Paul feels driven by a force he is not yet aware of.Given a gun as a present by a land developer, Paul finds a way to deal with the forces within. If he can't get those that attacked his family, he'll get those that terrorize the good citizens of New York.Hunted down by a police detective named Ochoa, played quite excellently by the late Vincent Gardenia, Kersey dispatches thugs and crooks with a harshness that borderlines on coldness. Kersey is on the verge of becoming that very thing he despises.Eventually, Kersey is captured, but there's a twist. Instead of arrest, the Ochoa is under orders to get Kersey to simply leave town A great drama with plenty of action. While Kersey does dispose of plenty of bad guys, he never does get the ones that attacked his family. And there's the final twist.This is perhaps one of the great films of the last 50 years, and doesn't get the credit it deserves. Check this film out, you won't be disappointed.",Death Wish
125,MikeK-7,Surprisingly powerful sleeper,9,13 March 2000,"In this movie (unlike the sequels), Paul actually seems somewhat remorseful, where in the other ones, it seems like a mission.  After his daughter is raped and wife murdered (by a young Jeff Goldblum), he takes to the streets, fighting back and showing that he's not going to put up with it anymore. The very last image of the film shows that Paul Kersey will probably not stop murdering muggers, he has just begun, hence the horrid sequels.......",Death Wish

Do not get me wrong I love Clint Eastwood and the entire Dirty Harry series but the series of events that Mr. Bronson had to endure was very very upsetting (like I was almost in the same room with Mr. Bronson feeling his pain, that is how good I think Michael Winner did in shooting this film). The opening scene (AKA Jeff Goldblum's debut) is very unsettling, but without that opening scene, we as the viewer really wouldn't have much to get amped up over. Bronson's retaliation is classic and I found this movie truly redeeming in the end. A true classic that will never lose it's touch. 10 out of 10 stars.",Death Wish
127,Elivx,Underrated non-Dirty Harry knock-off!,7,20 January 2021,"In the world of underrated films, comes out, ""Death Wish"". A vigilante flick from the 70s, tells a story of a vigilante-turned-architect man who takes the law into his own hands after the death of his wife and the raping of his daughter by killing lots and lots of thugs.As a film, ""Death Wish"" is a hit-or-miss type of a film that is both a film that makes you scared and entertained. While first time watching, you may think It's just a Dirty Harry knock-off with a different hero. No, it really isn't. The vigilante, Paul Kersey is a much better and more memorable character than Clint Eastwood's Harry Callahan. (No offense for Clint, but Charles' character was just better) Paul is more badass, life-risker and angrier than Harry, which makes his character weaker.Death Wish is also more serious with its tone and characters. It's not just trying to tell a simple story about becoming a vigilante, but it's also about self-protection with justice and the film doesn't forget it. You see, if you're using a gun as a help to your protection, you have a fully legal right to shoot at the attacker, but you might wanna use a fake identity... Incase, you keep shooting your attackers all the time.While the sequels went up towards a more campy direction, part 1 will always stay as the one, which started it all and as the serious one. Although, part 1 suffers from oversimplicity, boring pace and questionable moments, they just make the film more original as it was a 70s film by that time. So, if you wanna check out this overall, serious and an original film about vigilantism, go ahead and watch it.",Death Wish

I like to see movies like this with non stop action and violence. The truth is, this is my kind of movie. And it's not even completely senseless violence,either. This is the story of Paul Kersy a man who has his family life ruined by three thugs(one of them Jeff Goldblum, in an early role.) The thugs rape his daughter and kill his wife. Kersy slowly changes his view on guns, from hating them to carrying one around with him at all times. He becomes a vigilante/city hero by blowing holes through the criminals of New York City,killing any who attempt to mug him. This movie is a bit slow moving, but has no pointless scene, every moment adds to the story. And, while the scenes of Kersy shooting the scum of New York almost never seem to end, they never get boring either. The message of this films seems to be that vigilante justice cleans up crime and is more effective than lawful justice, while the book it's based on says vigilante justice only adds more crime. Any way you look at this film, you will see it is thought provoking and action packed.",Death Wish
129,GTeixeira,Revenge or Justice?,8,28 July 2013,"Paul Kersey, a New York architect and all-around common man, has his wife and daughter attacked by criminals in their apartment: his wife is murdered, his daughter is rapped and left traumatized, and the criminals are not caught. His life shattered, he returns from a 'vacation' in Arizona (where he watches an 'Old West' show, where justice was made with guns) with a new mindset: to kill criminals at night, as a vigilante.His actions spark the interest of the media as the people of NY start following in his footsteps and fighting back on muggers and burglars. This doesn't bode well with the politics and the police, though, as officer Frank Ochoa (even if he isn't fully unsympathetic to the vigilante's actions) is determined to catch the vigilante.Speaking about the movie itself, it is very good. Charles Bronson is great, one of the best tough guys in cinema history and still far better than most action stars from today. He makes a very good job as the disillusioned Paul Kersey. Vincent Gardenia, as Frank Ochoa, makes an adequate 'nemesis'. The movie is never dull, and quite gripping at most times.The one criticism I have is that the police had no real way to incriminate him, and he knew it, but was still scared. All of his actions WERE technically self-defense, and it wouldn't be difficult to prove at all.However, 'Death Wish' goes beyond just your typical action/cop thriller. At a time when crime was high in big cities, it invited a question most make themselves even today: how can we, the 'common citizens', react to crime? Is taking the matter on our hands, resorting to vigilantism, just another crime, or is it another face of justice? It is surprising, how people seem to love vigilantes in pure fiction (like 'Batman') yet they frown on such behavior on a more real situation. How they prefer to place the fault of crime on others, on the corruption of 'society', on politics or even on the poverty, and make the criminals look like the victims. 'They are still people! They have to be treated well, it's not their fault they did what they did!' Like Paul Kersey at the movie's beginning, to the point of being called a 'bleeding-heart liberal'... that is, before his only family ends attacked. Then the 'victims of society' become criminals who deserve death. Yet the movie is not overly one-sided, and actually questions Kersey's morality. His actions are, legally speaking, self-defense: he never actually attacks people just for their looks, but waits to be attacked first (he later 'lures' the criminals, though it still is their choice to attack him). But the fact that he made himself into the judge/jury/executioner leads to the understanding that he considers himself above the law, and we see that he is not totally sane at all (his reactions to guns near the beginning, plus the trauma of his wife and daughter being attacked), showcasing another side of the vigilante.How easy is it to go from a righteous self-defense to flat-out murder? How easy is it to lose control? How thin would the line separating crime and justice be in this situation?It is a point for reflection, one that can truly touch the viewer and might even change how he enjoys the film. If you believe his revenge can actually be justice, or if he by the end he became just another criminal... That is a strong discussion. I have my reservations on the subject, truth be told.I liked the film, its violence actually serving a purpose rather than being done just for kicks, the actors brought the needed realism that make it work so well and the action makes it never dull. The 'Taxi Driver' style ending was also quite a nice touch (but unfortunately called sub-par sequels to life).",Death Wish

131,stebird,Just who is the vigilante killer?,7,22 August 2017,"Kicks ass and takes no prisoners, that best sums Death Wish..., indeed there were a few sequels that followed the original in later years, but none of them were as raw and shocking as this first one.Charles Bronson was never the greatest actor, rather stoic in his approach he came across as unloving and didn't possess much emotion, hence why he was the perfect fit for the character of Paul Kersey, otherwise known as the vigilante killer!The idea behind Death Wish was sound, who doesn't want to watch scumbags and general low-lives get their comeuppance? And that is basically what Death Wish is, a guy who's wife is senselessly murdered by a trio of thugs ends up heartbroken and mentally damaged by his loss, this leads to the guy going out on a killing spree, looking for the right kind of scumbag in the right kind of place and leading them to their death. What struck me as odd was how lax the police were in finding the killer, it felt like I was watching a superhero film where the hero always seems to evade the law and everyone else, how Charles Bronson's Paul lasted so long without being caught was just a tad fantastical, in reality the police would've done better and Paul would've slipped up at some point. Death Wish was also a shining example of the changing times, seedy and dreary, and a tad erotic too..., e.g. a woman at one stage shows her bear breasts for all to see, it goes into disgusting detail when the two ladies are being assaulted by the thugs, and I believe one of them may have been raped; the murders also were overly detailed and shown in all their vile glory......Alas the film Death Wish was released in 1974, only ten years prior though this kind of film would've been outlawed by the strict rules imposed on Hollywood at the time, how times change indeed, Death Wish was released well after the New Hollywood era has emerged and explicitly demonstrated how much freedom there now was in Hollywood. Not an overly amazing film but definitely a landmark film of sorts, a perfect example of what a certain era in cinema history was like, in this case the 1970's and the New Hollywood era.",Death Wish
132,filmbuff-36,An interesting take on personal justice,9,7 December 1999,"Perhaps ""Death Wish"" is unquestionably the best vigilante film ever made. It's not the action-packed thrill-fest that movies like ""Kill Bill"" or ""The Punisher"" seek to be, instead it's a haunting, sometimes intoxicating look at our society's views on justice.Charles Bronson is Paul Kersey, a New York architect whose wife is killed by a group of muggers ransacking their apartment, an attack that also leaves his daughter catatonic. The killers are never caught, and Kersey is left shattered.He takes a job working for a land developer in New Mexico to get his mind off his troubles, and while there his long dormant fascination with guns is renewed when his client Ames Jainchill (Stuart Margolin) shows off his personal collection and lets him crack some shots off. He also witnesses a live reenactment of an Old West shootout, where frontier justice was administered at the end of the gun.Kersey soon arrives back in New York, livened up a bit from his visit and ready to resume his life. But the streets are still filled with thugs, and Kersey knows that Manhattan is not the best place to be at night. He discovers that Jainchill has given him a .32 revolver as a present, and subsequently uses it to kill a man trying to mug him. Kersey soon realizes the cathartic release of enacting vigilante revenge as the media reports his killings and other private citizens take action, all while police officer Frank Ochoa (Vincent Gardenia) leads a task force to capture the vigilante and stop future violence.""Death Wish"" was a product of its day -- a Nixon-era knee jerk reaction to rampant crime that turned out to be quite a hit. But to dismiss it simply as that would be to deny the film its true power. It asks the question of whether or not vigilantism can be used as a social good, and just how can a citizen properly defend himself from criminal attacks. More importantly, to the movie's credit it does introduce the downside of vigilantism, with Ochoa worrying that people will be whipped into such a frenzy that they'll start attacking anyone who looks suspicious.The movie does play it safe when it comes to Kersey's ""victims"" however. Every one of them is clearly a mugger, threatening his life or just wanting his money. But the movie does enter into ambiguous territory by looking at the actual actions Kersey takes. At first he just stumbles into traps set up by muggers or happens on a crime taking place; later on the other hand it's clear that he's actually inviting attacks by making himself a target. And the self-defense aspect of his actions becomes equally cloudy when he kills muggers that are already fleeing. He wants to punish them for their crimes, which itself can be morally troubling.But to understand ""Death Wish"" you had to understand the times. Murder rates were very high in New York City, and many muggers had little problem killing their victims. The criminals in the film are not overly sympathetic either, most of them clearly hippies or other social undesirables, probably hooked on drugs from their ""free love"" days and now stuck in the bitter reality of narcotic dependency now that the good times are over. It's hard to feel sorry for someone willing to kill you just for a couple hours worth of pleasure. I'm sure the movie's audiences in New York, and probably across the country, enjoyed living out their revenge fantasies vicariously through Kersey.It should be said that Bronson, normally criticized as a wooden actor, gives a remarkably strong performance. This may be due to his friendship with director Michael Winner, who also helmed several of his other films. But it's probably due to the fact that the movie was not written as an action hero vehicle, and because of this the story demanded a character more grounded in reality. Kersey is not a superhero -- he's just one man trying to make a difference in the world.Also, he's not all there, either. The movie makes it clear that Kersey is a little deranged as well, and one wonders just how far he might go to do what he thinks is right. The sequels were more interested in making him out to be an infallible crusader against evil, abandoning any pretext of social commentary and just offering body counts, but here at least the movie shows that someone willing to go on a shooting spree isn't quite right in the head, regardless of the guilt of his victims.Supporting roles are excellent as well. A very young Jeff Goldblum nails his performance as one of the muggers who invades Kersey's apartment, immediately scary and repellent. Gardenia is a nice foil for Bronson, making Ochoa an intelligent officer not unsympathetic to Kersey's crusade, especially when he sees how the crime rate plummets following the killings. Christopher Guest, who would go on to star in hit mockumentaries like ""This is Spinal Tap,"" ""Best in Show"" and ""A Mighty Wind"" has a small but memorable role as a police officer towards the end of the movie. In fact, everyone does a good job.Ultimately, your enjoyment of ""Death Wish"" will probably rely both on your politics and views toward crime. It's a movie where the critic is judged based on his review, which is just as well I suppose. It's at once fascinating, and still very timely.Nine out of ten stars. Bronson's best solo movie and certainly a very thought-provoking piece, which is lost on both people who only want to watch it for the mugger killings and those who just dismiss it a fascist trash.",Death Wish
133,pninson,A guilty pleasure,6,12 April 2008,"Released at a time when crime in America seemed out of control, DEATH WISH gave people the chance to vicariously enjoy the thrill of blowing away the bad guys. Charles Bronson was forever typecast out of serious acting after his compelling performance as an upper-class liberal who experiences the classic saying, ""A conservative is a liberal who's been mugged."" After his wife is killed and his daughter raped, Kersey becomes a vigilante and quickly moves from mere self-defense to hunting down and blowing away anyone who messes with him.While this film is crudely manipulative, especially in the cartoonishly repugnant rape-and-murder scene at the beginning, it is effective and raises some interesting questions. DEATH WISH presents a world in which people have become timid, scared mice, spinelessly allowing criminal repulsivos to take over the streets. Some people do see our society this way, but in the 35 years since DEATH WISH was made, New York City has become much safer and crime is not the burning issue it once was.Bronson's vigilante is nicely balanced by Vincent Gardenia's endearing portrayal of the detective Ochoa assigned to hunt him down. Gardenia's rumpled, wry, dogged flatfoot gives the film a lightening touch it desperately needs, and the final scene between detective and vigilante has just the right touch.This is not really a political film, although it does touch on certain issues. If the police are ineffective, should people be able to defend themselves? The answer to this would appear to be obvious, and yet this film doesn't try to force it on you. It's possible to enjoy this film as a guilty pleasure without taking it too seriously.I do question whether the police are quite as ineffective as is portrayed in this film. When Bronson asks whether there's a chance of catching the men who attacked this family, the detective replies, ""Of course there's a chance ... but ... in the city, that's how it is."" Here the film is telling you that the cops can't handle it, and things are out of control. It's easy for the viewer to forget that Bronson was not there when his family was attacked. His wife is dead and his daughter has retreated into catatonia, so the cops don't really have a description. With no description, exactly how do you expect them to find the perpetrators? As Bronson becomes more addicted to his nightly prowling, which rapidly becomes compulsive behavior, it's easy to forget that he's never seen the original attackers. He's just lashing out at anyone who represents them. The movie is careful to pit him only against obvious repulsivos, but anytime someone goes around shooting people to death there's a good chance he'll kill someone who was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.DEATH WISH may be manipulative, but at least it allows the viewer to make his/her own decisions about the larger issues.",Death Wish

135,Gatorman9,Cloying,6,16 June 2015,"Watching this movie again more than 40 years after it first came out is interesting. While it can still touch a nerve somewhere deep down inside, on the surface at least, it seems heavily clichéd to the point of being cloying. It seems heavy-handed and in terms of its style very heavily dated. I do not think it has stood up all that well to the test of time. Anybody who saw this as an adolescent in the 70's should have enough life experience by now to know it is almost as much of a fantasy as Star Wars. Even where crimes of the nature seen at the beginning of this movie do occur, in real life they don't look, or more importantly, feel the way they are depicted here. It would be interesting to see a thoughtful modern-day remake, but it is unlikely anybody will do a thoughtful one. Instead, you only get even more fantastic, exploitative renditions, in the light of which, it is no wonder America has become a filled with foolish, immature, paranoid gun-crazies that can't go to the bathroom anymore without slinging an assault rifle. As Roger Ebert once said while discussing film noir, ""no society could have created a world so filled with doom, fate, fear and betrayal, unless it were essentially naive and optimistic."" Hell, maybe the answer to this movie in 2015 is a movie about a ""vigilante"" who shoots gun-crazies to prove how ridiculous they are. Under these circumstances, I give this one a mere six.",Death Wish
136,world_of_weird,Happiness is a sock full of quarters,7,29 July 2005,"Michael Winner stopped making films some time ago and became a professional rent-a-celeb, boulevardier and occasional restaurant critic, largely because his last few movies stank. But there was a time when the redoubtable friend of the stars was capable of better things, and DEATH WISH is proof that Winner once had some degree of talent. A talent untroubled by considerations of subtlety, good taste and understatement, but talent nonetheless. DEATH WISH tells the story of Paul Kersey (a fine performance from the late Charles Bronson), a happily-married architect returning from a second honeymoon with his wife to the scum-encrusted toilet that was New York City circa 1974. Most directors make the viewer wait at least twenty minutes before hitting them with their first jolt of adrenalin-rushing excitement, but Winner can't wait that long, so within the first ten minutes we see Kersey's wife and daughter attacked and raped in their own apartment by three drugged-out hooligans. Even thirty years down the line, it's a genuinely shocking scene; not even the presence of Jeff Goldblum as one of the most reprehensible and hateful thugs ever to smear a screen can diminish its impact. Kersey's wife dies and his daughter slips into a traumatized catatonic state (look quickly for Marshall Anker, the dumb sheriff from LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT during the snowbound funeral scene), prompting him to take a job in Tuscon to take his mind off things. In Tuscon, he meets up with a good-ole-boy property developer who invites him down to the gun club where Kersey turns out to be something of a sharp-shooter. Suitably impressed, the redneck presents Kersey with the parting gift of a handgun, which comes in useful during the second half of the film, during which the vengeance-crazed architect sets himself up as an easy target for muggers, only to wipe them out the moment things get nasty.DEATH WISH reads like simple, gut-level exploitation, and to a large extent that's exactly what it is, but Bronson's subtle, believable performance, the well-drawn characters, the effective NYC location shooting, Arthur Ornitz's grimy photography and Winner's knack for snappy action sequences help to rise the film above the sum of its parts and make it a minor classic. There's a lot of black humour on offer, some of which works (Vincent Gardenia's performance as the downtrodden, headcold-harbouring detective is always amusing), but some of which - such as the nose-picking hookers and the minor character whose dog ""paints such marvellous pictures with his paws"" - are simply perplexing. Above all else, DEATH WISH is a highly effective mood piece, the kind of film that goes down well after a hard day, as a reminder that somebody is always worse off than yourself, or as an escape valve for all your guilty fantasies about slaughtering whichever inconsiderate lout stole your parking space or your seat on the bus. For that reason alone, DEATH WISH belongs in your video collection as a very guilty pleasure.",Death Wish
137,kuciak,A Response to Sweet Sweatback,7,22 September 2009,"Richard Pryor once complained on afternoon talk that while people were saying you can't have a black man throw a white man out of the window, it seemed like it was okay for Charles Bronson to go and gundown black guys. Pryor I think really understood what Death Wish was really all about. In the early 70's starting with Sweet Sweatbacks Badass Song, until about 74, the so called black exploitation films catered to a black audience wanting to see a black superhero killing bad white guys.While Dirty Harry showed Harry shooting black bank robbers, (a first at that time), and Roger Moore as James Bond taking on a black crime syndicate led my Yaphet Kotto (A film with its tongue in its cheek) Death Wish really takes on black on white crime head on. Yes, Kersey's wife and daughter are murdered and brutally raped respectively by white criminals, 6 of the 10 criminals that Kersey kills in Death Wish are black. When at a party someone comments that the vigilante killer is mostly killing black people, a party goer remarks that mostly blacks commit crimes.Having white criminals in the film, was I think mainly used to hide the films response to ""white resentment"" and possible fear of ""the black man as criminal"". Growing up in the Bay Area in the 70's I remember the Zebra Killings, and other murders that seemed to be occurring by blacks on whites. In Death Wish, the white criminals are mostly shown to be possibly crazy, and maybe hooked on drugs, while the black criminals are somewhat shown to be more calculating. Having white baddies in the film allowed the film not to be considered racist. Also it was mentioned in the newspapers and on TV that black audiences were also cheering Bronson killing muggers, though when I saw this film in Berkeley California, I don't remember such cheering, though their were African Americans in the audience.Watching Death Wish Many years later, I realized what a cartoonish and silly film it is, much like the Sweet Sweatback Bad Ass Song, if not more polished. Sad it some way, that Bronson's role as Paul Kersey would be the film he would be most famous for in the US, and not his role as Harmonica in Once Upon a Time in The West, or even his other Bronson-Winner collaboration ""The Mechanic"". Yet Death Wish is an interesting film as propaganda. At one time, the idea was to have Henry Fonda in the film. Sadly, I think the film would have been different, but wow, if the film had been with Fonda, in the same form it is now, what would Jane have said?",Death Wish

139,paul_johnr,"Paul Kersey, Urban Cowboy",7,4 November 2005,"Whether fans of Charles Bronson like it or not, the now-departed actor will be best remembered for his gig as Paul Kersey, that pop icon who created a sensation when 'Death Wish' first hit the screens in 1974. Having already made his name in such films as 'The Magnificent Seven,' 'Once Upon a Time in the West,' and 'The Dirty Dozen,' Bronson's quiet demeanor proved an ideal fit for this Dino De Laurentiis-produced trailblazer.'Death Wish' was a timely film, as many American cities were swamped in high crime rates. New York City was a shining example of urban decay, with its government bankrupt and public services heavily cut. The NYC Police Department had an aging and ineffective staff, school teachers were being laid off by the hundreds, sanitation was on the wayside, and the city's roads, bridges, and subways were falling to pieces. The drug trade was entering full steam and pimps were going about their business 24 hours a day. Violent crime was taking place in every neighborhood and murders occurred by the dozen each week. Subway trains were popular work sites for muggers and Central Park became a gunned-out, graffiti-infested battle zone that wasn't approachable at any time of day, let alone at night.A cross-country rise in urban squalor led to the vigilante film of post-Vietnam War America, with 'Death Wish' as its spearhead. Loosely based on Brian Garfield's novel, the film makes use of themes from old-time Westerns, transporting them to 1970s New York City, where a similar lawlessness had taken hold. 'Death Wish' was very much a potboiler of its time, offering a quick release for those dealing with endless crime and failing bureaucracies.Most film-goers already have a basic idea of the plot. Paul Kersey (Bronson) is a middle class architect who lives in Manhattan. He is politically a liberal who sympathizes with the poor and despises violence. This all changes, however, when his wife Joanna (Hope Lange) and daughter Carol (Kathleen Tolan) are attacked by three punks who break into their apartment. Joanna is fatally beaten while Carol is raped and left mentally incapacitated, ending up in a sanatorium on Long Island.The scum having gotten away with their crimes, Kersey plunges into helplessness until he visits a Tuscan land developer named Ames Jainchill (Stuart Margolin), who is the stereotypical gunslinger with a Dodge boasting longhorns and cow-patterned seat covers. Kersey is introduced to quieter surroundings, where people seem in harmony with the land. He visits Jainchill's gun club one evening out of curiosity and reveals excellent shooting skills that were passed on by his father. His architectural work complete, Kersey returns to New York with a .32 caliber as his going-away present and begins to walk the streets at night, in search of lowlifes to mow down.Three decades removed from when 'Death Wish' first appeared and with crime rates hitting their lowest levels in forty years, we can now look at the film's viewpoints with a clearer head. There are many elements of 'Death Wish' that are sensationalized and white-hot, which cause the film to lack a true balance of opinion and place it at risk of becoming a cheap shoot-'em-up. For all of its political sentiment, 'Death Wish' only touches the surface of important questions. We are never asked to find realistic solutions to our crime problem, nor does the film discuss major issues like the role of police in American life, gun control, and correcting flaws in our justice system. Instead, issues are thrown around just to move the plot forward or create the impression that 'Death Wish' is more socially relevant than it actually is.Many of the characters who surround Bronson are underdeveloped and only serve as touts for extreme views of the political spectrum. Inspector Ochoa, while played strongly by Vincent Gardenia, is the typical rogue cop, loving his own ugliness and begrudgingly going about his job; Paul's work colleague Sam (William Redfield) spurts off about locking the poor in concentration camps; and Jainchill (Margolin), the most important supporting role, is a quintessential NRA member who places guns in the same category as spoons, hammers, and ballpoint pens: ""Just a tool."" These characters are so exaggerated that it's impossible for Kersey not to look an out-and-out hero, the man with some grounding in a world of outrageous contradiction.Having pointed out these flaws, there are certain elements of 'Death Wish' that will survive the test of time. The storyline of Paul Kersey is compelling and will always receive a great deal of sympathy from those who watch it. Kersey's ordeal is a believable one and we cannot help but root for him as he cases the dark streets night after night, looking to somehow vindicate what has been done to his family. As long as there are crimes and victims of crime, 'Death Wish' is guaranteed a willing audience.Michael Winner has been a target of criticism for his other films, including two ridiculous 'Death Wish' sequels. Winner does some of his best work in the original, however, making effective use of that jarring, 'in-and-out' style he is known for. His directing is fairly good in this one, with help from Wendell Mayes' tight screenplay. The score by jazz composer Herbie Hancock creates a sense of doom from the outset. Editing and continuity are also pluses. Technically speaking, the film is nicely stitched together.Hope Lange and Kathleen Tolan appear briefly, but deserve a great deal of credit for acting out the robbery scene that is sickening to watch; Jeff Goldblum (in his film debut), Christopher Logan, and Gregory Rozakis are convincing as the hoods. The only blemish is Steven Keats, playing Kersey's son-in-law Jack (why he calls Joanna and Paul 'Mom' and 'Dad' is never explained). Keats is rather annoying as the whiny, browbeaten relative, probably due to his weak position in the script.*** out of 4",Death Wish
140,ramsfan,The Father of all Revenge Films,9,4 July 2017,"Though the theme had been tackled many times before, it can be argued that Death Wish is the father of all revenge films. Countless knockoffs, both good and bad, have been made since its release in 1974. Yet to characterize it solely as a revenge movie would be a disservice. It is a culturally significant movie which raises issues about the role of vigilantism in our society. Charles Bronson, who'd enjoyed previous success in feature films prior to Death Wish, became an anti-hero of sorts in a couple dozen movies throughout the next fifteen years after its release.Bronson plays Paul Kersey, an architect who lives in a New York City apartment. His world is shattered when his wife is beaten to death and his daughter is savagely raped by thugs posing as grocery deliverymen. After an unspecified mourning period and for cathartic effect, he is sent on a land developing assignment in New Mexico, where he meets client Ames Jainchill (Stuart Margolin). In contrast to Kersey's conscientious objector war beliefs, Jainchill embraces responsible gun use and winces at the ""toilet"" New York has become. He piques Kersey's interest at a gun range and a Wild West re-enactment show. Following completion of the project, Jainchill sees off Kersey at the airport and puts a gift in his luggage: a shiny new revolver.Kersey is accosted one night by a mugger and shoots him dead, after which he returns to his apartment and becomes physically sick. Ruminating on the death of his wife and his now-catatonic daughter, he sets himself up as a target for a variety of street scum throughout the city, killing them at various intervals and earning himself the tag of ""vigilante killer"" by the Press. Police Detective Frank Ochoa (Vincent Gardenia) is tasked with the dilemma of upholding the law in identifying the killer while facing the reality that his superiors and many New Yorkers are not all that upset at the city unconventionally being relieved of its criminals.Death Wish was extremely popular during a dreary period in the city's history when crime was rampant and presents the obvious ambiguity of vigilantism in a civilized society. The assault on Kersey's wife and daughter are brutally depicted, even by today's standards of viewing. It allows us to justify Kersey's actions towards a variety of unsavory characters. Disturbing to some, however, is the controversial way Kersey sets himself up as a target to draw out the criminals, a sense of entrapment if you will, in going from hunted to hunter.Not surprisingly, the financial success of Death Wish spawned several sequels, none of which were memorable. But the original packs a punch and tests our own beliefs about street justice. A very good film from the 70s which still holds relevance today. Highly recommended movie.",Death Wish
141,The_Wagon,Pretty good movie!,8,5 February 2006,"Death Wish is a movie from the 70's that was based on a book. It was so popular, that it had four sequels. This is Death Wish, and it's the only movie in the Death Wish series that critics don't bash. Death Wish II was bad, Death Wish 3 was a great comedy, Death Wish 4 was OK, and Death Wish 5 was bad. Death Wish isn't non-stop action like Death Wish 3. It's not a comedy like Death Wish II and Death Wish 3. It's a good 90 minute movie starring the late Charles Bronson. It starts off on the beach where Paul Kersey(Bronson) and his wife(some actress) are having fun in the sun. Paul is taking pictures of his wife and they're having a jolly good time. But then, they go back home to the crappy crime-filled streets of New York. Everything's all dirty and grimy and gross. Paul's wife goes grocery shopping and some thugs follow her home. They knock on the door and say that they're delivering the groceries. She lets them in and they rape her and her daughter. It's a gruesome scene. Paul's wife dies. He wants revenge.

143,antileft,A Classic vigilante flick still rocks,6,17 September 2008,"I watched the movie for the first time a few days ago , and must conclude that although made in 1974 it still has an appeal : simply put , this is a 'typical'crime movie with C. Bronson , made three years since the famous Inspector Callahan in the Dirty Harry series , both sharing some common points , namely : society has lost its defensive abilities , and mega-cities have become virtual Darwinian jungles , where less strong , less organized , honest and law-abiding are the prey , where the police are powerless bureaucrats , limited by the leftists laws, legislation and callousness , and only lone 'cowboys' , who shoot first and fill in the reports much later ,are the sole protectors of the innocent ! C. Bronson's character  P. Kersey is not an officer of the law , but a successful architect , even  as we learn in the movie later  a conscientious objector to wars and guns whose life is suddenly turned upside down , as his family is attacked in their own apartment in the broad daylight by a street gang  one of the perpetrators is no other than J.Goldblum, perhaps in his first major role ! As the police is powerless , and even not too interested , Charles Bronson is forced to take the law in his hands , and that is not an easy decision , not without psychological consequences and moral dilemmas ,and this is in fact the beauty of the movie , which tries to show the limits of human patience , and how much humiliation and sacrifice must one endure before one takes decisive action as nothing else works .All in all, a classic that was followed by equally good , but more extreme sequels, some produced by now defunct Cannon Co.",Death Wish
144,actionstar-89625,One of Bronson's Best Characters,8,17 December 2019,"Now, I haven't seen every single Charles Bronson movie out there, but of the ones I have the character of Paul Kersey that he plays here is one of his best characters. Upon its release I believe this film was not appreciated and thought of as a violent, brash and disgusting look at life in NYC. But, I saw Bronson who had to deal with a very serious life-changing event that seemed as if the cops were never going to solve. To me there is much more here that just a bloody and brutal flick. Bronson showed more acting chops that just some guy running around opening up a can of whoop ass.He plays a successful architect and soon after the opening credits his wife (Hope Lange) is killed and daughter (Kathleen Tolan) is sexually assaulted. Yes it is a brutal scene and I don't think I will ever be able to stomach it. So, this film is not for everybody as yes one reaction to this scene would be to equate this film as nothing but trashy, violent slop. But, I give director Michael Winner credit as I believe he really manipulates the audience in cheering for Paul Kersey and his fight with the situation he is put up against. Because, I do NOT believe in vigilantism by any means. I believe that the police should go out and prevent and stop crime, while arresting those that have committed acts against the law. But, perhaps this film just shows me that its not so black and white. The cops have no clue as to who killed his wife and he is told that he must just face what the city dishes out. So he goes out to spell out some vigilantism against the filth of the streets.Also starring Vincent Gardenia (who I think is perfectly cast) as Detective Frank Ochoa, Stuart Margolin in a memorable role as Aimes Jainchill and Jeff Goldblum in I think his first role as one of the thugs who attack Kersey's wife and daughter.As I said earlier this film is not for everybody, but if this does sound interesting give this classic 70s Bronson flick a watch.

145,MovieMan-112,The best movie about justice,10,2 January 2000,"Death Wish is a classic, no doubt about it. Charles Bronson plays his most famous performance as Paul Kersey, the architect who comes home one day to find his wife raped and killed and his daughter brutally raped and beaten. The most clever thing about the movie is that it doesn't turn into the usual ""good guy goes after bad guy"" formula. The muggers who broke into his home and killed/raped his wife and daughter are never caught. This is what leads to Bronson becoming a local vigilante. By doing so, he hopes one night that he will encounter and kill the muggers who killed his wife and brutally beat his daughter (who became comatose after the attack). You can closely relate to the Paul Kersey character and that's what makes this movie so effective. The movie could have fell apart right from the beginning when the attack occurs. Bronson could have chased after the attackers or eventually kill them all at the end; That would have been a predictable and happy hollywood ending. Fortunately, the movie doesn't turn out that way. Paul Kersey never encounters or kills any of the muggers who attacked his family. Instead, he makes his neighborhood safer by getting rid of the other muggers and killers who wander around. He gets shot in the leg, identified by a decent cop as the ""unknown vigilante"" who lets him go because he can relate to his sufferings. The best part is he made a difference. Great Film!",Death Wish
146,Jakethemuss,Straight to the point,9,16 September 2007,"Directed by Michael Winner and starring the late Charles Bronson in the lead role, this is a gritty inner city revenge film which comes off as a competent and effective social statement.Paul Kersey (Bronson) is a liberal architect living in a not so nice, crime ridden area of the city. He lives with his wife and daughter, who are brutally attacked whilst at home by 3 sadistic street trash thugs (a young Jeff Goldblum is one of them) whilst he is out. The wife is beaten into unconsciousness before later dying in hospital, and the daughter is sexually assaulted and goes into a catatonic state as a result of the shock.It is this terrible event which changes Kerseys perception of law and order. He starts to change his way of thinking, starts to change his way of acting. He sees an overstretched police force struggling with the city's crime and social decay, and feels he, just one man, can make a difference. Kersey soon enough takes to the streets, never to look for trouble, but to let trouble come to him, and deal with it directly in his own way! He is tired of being the decent citizen who shakes their head at the morning paper, talks amongst friends but does nothing to change what he sees. The film becomes better still as the police find themselves under pressure with the recent vigilante killings, and the media report that once helpless victims are fighting back against their attackers inspired by this new rebel.This is one of those films that has had a lasting effect on me, and I remember being quite shaken after watching it. It seems so real as Kersey could just as easily be a next door neighbour or uncle, he is no hulking giant with an arsenal of weaponry or superpowers, no fearless warrior who can't be scratched...he is just another man trying to make a living. Cleverly directed, well acted and graphic when it has to be, this is a great film and serves its purpose well. Gripping, raw and impactive, this is one of Bronson greatest films, and stands as a classic.",Death Wish
147,zofos,Down These Mean Streets A Man Must Walk,6,16 March 2010,"It's New York in 1974 and architect Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson) has a good life and a happy family. That is all shattered one day when three thugs (one played by a very young Jeff Goldblum) follow Kersey's wife and daughter home from the supermarket. They attack them and end up killing his wife and leaving his daughter catatonic. Kersey takes to the streets and starts blasting away muggers left, right and centre in a series of vigilante attacks. The killings end when he is warned to leave town by the police or face a prison term.There are some problems with the script of ""Death Wish"" that blunt its power somewhat. While it's realistic that Kersey would not be able to find his wife's killers in a city the size of New York, it's not dramatically satisfying that he never pinpoints them. You want to see Kersey make the thugs pay for what they did. Instead, what happens is that Kersey randomly shoots a load of muggers and his wife's murderers get away scot-free. It makes the whole movie seem pointless.The movie also goes off the point halfway through when Kersey has to leave New York and go out West for a business meeting with a character called Janechill. The writers try to make the connection that Kersey is like a gunfighter from the old West dispensing justice when the law fails to do so. They even go so far as to give the Bronson character John Wayne's line from ""True Grit"" when he confronts a mugger: ""Fill your hand."" It's a diversion we don't need to a point that's laboured too much. Again, it may be realistic for Kersey to have to leave New York on business, but it's not dramatically satisfying as it takes him away from the problem we want to see him solve for a long time. The second act sags quite a bit here.That's one of the reasons why ""Death Wish II"" is a better movie. Bronson's character finds and kills every one of the gang responsible for murdering his daughter and there is no midway distraction from what he sets out to do.Life imitated art when Bernie Goetz really did shoot some muggers on a New York subway in 1984 and all the old arguments raised in this movie came up again; Is it right to take the law into your own hands? Is it okay to shoot ""scum"" who ""deserve it""? Should gun controls be tougher?, etc.""Death Wish"" is a good movie if a little dated now. More importantly, it finally made Charles Bronson an A-list star in his 50s and he made four sequels, the fifth of which would be his last theatrical release.

Again (, or as a matter of fact for the first time in this movie-series,) the candy-stealin' bad guys are really bad, actually they behave like some braindamaged children and look like comic characters. They have long hair, they dress ridiculously and everything. They are ugly,but of course not as ugly as mr.Bronson. And for some reason they run all the time. Even Troma can't do anything as exaggerated and comically unrealistic as this. It's quite funny to see these future-good actors (here Jeff Goldblum, in the sequel Larry Fishburne) doing these far-out stupid roles. You can see how they steal the whole show, at least from the other motley cru members. But anyway, after the stupid start, the movie turns out to be much better than it first seems. As a matter of fact, at least to my opinion, it transforms almost to a different movie after the beginning.This is technically (as if such a thing would matter) better than the sequel; Photography is good, and of course the music, which is by Herbie Hancock. That alone might make the movie interesting to some people. It's also one of the very few movies, that has some scenes filmed with real snow (or fake snow that at least looks real). The movie is in every way more whole than the sequel. The film is overally deeper and much less nihilistic. One thing that makes Bronson's main character interesting, is how sick (althought seemingly normal and well-functioning) he is, at least at times, and of course for understandable reasons also. And it's also natural that in the sequel he's even sicker. (I have to check out some other sequel also.) There is some ""character development"" in this story; The main character learns things, and thinks about different possibilities (what to do/what should be done with his life). It has interesting themes and juxtapositions: Countryside/City, Old/New.It's funny how some pictures in this movie reminds of ""Taxi driver"", which is made a year or two later. Maybe it's just New York (in the seventies). I don't know has Scorsese seen this before he made the classic, I think he has. Actually he maybe even made some homages to this film: If I remember correctly, there is exactly the same kind of target board (with some ""mugger"" on it), which Travis shoots in ""Taxi driver"" and which here hangs very visibly in the police department's wall. Of course that could also be a coincidence. Of course the themes are also similar to some point, but that has to be put to the writer's account. I don't know when the ""Death Wish"" book has been published, and has Paul Schrader read it. Anyway it doesn't matter, because outside of the formalities these two movies don't have much similarities, and they surely are two totally independent works and both deserve their places in movie history. In any case it's interesting to see what kind of cultural atmospheres and grounds classics like ""Taxi driver"" has been made in. One more comparison: In this film I like that it doesn't have any hurry (and still it doesn't last longer than one and half hours): In fact there isn't too much big ""happenings"" or big dramatic turns in the plot. I think ""Taxi driver"" would have to be at least an hour longer to get to this non-hurriness (, if it would still want to include the same events to the story).Actually I have nothing to complain about in this movie. This is one tough movie and it still raises same questions as in times when it was made.",Death Wish
151,john_oneill41,Bronson's Finest Hour,10,17 March 2010,"Gripping tale of Paul Kersey, a liberal architect,who takes revenge on the criminals of New York after his wife is murdered and his daughter left catatonic from an attack in their apartment by a bunch of random thugs.Bronson is particularly good at portraying the generous liberal Paul at the beginning of the movie and how he changes into the steely ruthless Paul at the end. This is one of several things which make this film stand out and make it just a little different from other similar movies. For example, the original attackers are never seen again, elevating Paul's subsequent actions from simple revenge to all out war against the criminal underworld of New York, which has the knock on effect of scaring off the other criminals and making the general populace tougher. I especially enjoyed the part where the building foreman says about the mugger he and his crew caught, ""Well we roughed him up a little,"" and the news reporter then says, ""the mugger had two broken arms, a broken leg and cracked ribs"" or something like that.Also good is how it shows the evolution of Kersey's various reactions to his circumstances from being afraid to hold a sock of coins, to being sick after he shoots his first victim, to actively going out and flashing his money around, attracting potential muggers so he can kill them.Bronson's facial expressions are exceptional, looking genuinely surprised and shocked by his potential muggers while at the same time shooting them, sometimes twice to make sure they are dead.Another point that makes it stand out from the norm is that Paul's getting away with it is not a result of a sympathetic detective telling him he has a five minute head-start or something like that, but is officially sanctioned for reasons that make perfect sense.OK so the rape scene is brutal, but I would say necessary and in the context of this film justified. The son in law Jack Toby is so annoying that in real life any self respecting father in law would beat the living crap out of him. Something I can't understand is why Jack keeps calling Paul Dad. Is this an American tradition? In Ireland, where I'm from, men generally call their fathers in law by their first names and call their own fathers Dad.Although now that I write this, I'm just wondering if the character was made deliberately annoying to throw Paul's toughness into sharp relief and also if his passivity and willingness to do nothing is there to provide a counterpoint to Paul's decision to stand up for himself and therefore a stimulus for his actions. In this context, the character is exactly what is needed.I loved this film far better than I thought I would, I could watch it over and over again and I, provided you're not too easily offended, would recommend it to anyone.",Death Wish

I must agree that in 1974 crime was very high in the streets and the subways and the city was a filthy place and the subway trains full of graffiti. I travel to the city many times a year and you can see the difference 30 years have made. Clean , safe subways, clean streets and crime at it's lowest in years.

155,zippyflynn2,Run and Hide No More,10,13 February 2007,"""What do you call people who when they're faced with a condition of fear do nothing about it they just run and hide?"" Paul Kersey.This is one of my favorite films made from one of my favorite books. I lived in New York during the 1970's and can attest that crime was out of control then, the subways, parks and many streets were no man's land at night where you only went if you really had to or else you wanted to score dope, get a cheap hooker (or be one), or just for the thrill and danger. Police corruption had been so rampantly widespread for so long that there was no law and order and the thugs had taken over the night. If you question this just see Serprico and read that book which details how one honest cop almost died and was nearly buried by the massive tide of corrupt cops he was trying to expose, which was practically all the other cops. The majority of the people lived in fear of being in the streets at night and even many places during the day. Even if you packed heat that was no guarantee of anything, it wasn't uncommon to come across a gang of muggers all carrying guns, knives, baseball bats, etc. Most people in New York then were as Paul Kersey described only worse, not only did they run and hide from fear and danger but they ignored the suffering of others. New Yorkers had developed a reputation as cold and indifferent, which was fairly accurate. I remember a concert in Central Park where a girl was gang banged by a group of guys and hundreds of people just watched it, too afraid, too apathetic, or too vicariously sadistic to get involved. Someone even stole her clothes and she staggered around naked and bleeding in the rain. Things were not good and just about everybody in New York felt angry, alienated and helpless. People were sick of it all, the terrible Vietnam war, corrupt Richard Nixon, corrupt cops, corrupt everything, but they mostly were sick of being afraid and tired of living in fear.Then the movie ""Death Wish"" came out. The theater was packed when I went, which surprised me, as I had already read the book and knew what it was about but how did these other people know, besides it was a matinée. I discovered why everyone was there when Paul Kersey shot his first mugger: the whole place exploded in screaming cheers and the cheers got more powerful and louder with each subsequent vigilante act. I had been to Yankees games and concerts where you hear screaming and cheers but nothing had the power of the cheers on that day. There was something wonderfully cathartic taking place, everyone in that audience who had ever been mugged or had been afraid of being mugged, which was virtually everyone, was delighting in having the tables turned. We felt safe, and were happy to see a somewhat soft spoken, average kind of a guy being played by Charles Bronson kick a*s for us, take out the bad guys. This was a new, radical concept back then, an open revenge film where an ordinary appearing guy beats the muggers at their own game. It was a great experience and we all felt like we too could be as tough as Charles Bronson, at least during that safe little reprieve within the theater.Say what you will about the film, its technical shortcomings, you'd be hard pressed or less than honest to say that Charles Bronson didn't display his international appeal in this movie, the one that made him the world's biggest box office draw. He appears in this movie just like he was in real life, a quiet, unassuming kind of guy who really was tough, not the usual Hollywood tough guy who is so unconvincing because he can't fully hide his physical and character based qualities that are everything but a real, quiet, cool tough guy. Bronson was the real deal, just read about his earlier life if you want to know.This film got a lot of negative reaction as being a crass and brutal revenge film, and other typical cavalier comments. The New Yorkers who lived it, all the ones I knew and the ones in the theater that day, loved it for what it was, a piece of cinematic magic to make us feel like we weren't afraid and would perhaps very soon never have to feel afraid again. If you've never been mugged or been afraid of being mugged it's very easy to tell others how they're suppose to react, what they're suppose to like, think, do, etc. But until you've lived in a real urban jungle, you'll never know the great release that a movie like ""Death Wish"" can bring you. It's strictly vicarious entertainment but what marvelous entertainment it is!",Death Wish

157,pocomarc,Best ever of its genre,10,8 February 2007,"Charles Bronson was only in two movies that fit him perfectly.DEATH WISH and HARD TIMES.The scene in the hospital after Paul Kersey's wife and daughter are attacked is very believable.The son in law (and his reactions to the same events) is used as a contrast to Bronson's reactions.The scenes between the two are significant, culminating in Bronson's redecorating his apartment in a garish way to wipe out the stain of the crime that took place there that deprived him of his wife and daughter.The inhuman character of his city of New York is illustrated by the scene where two young men bump into Bronson as they laugh about a movie they just saw, continuing with their conversation as and after they bump him as if he is an inanimate object.The trip to Texas is significant and the character Aimes Jainchill is important.This sets up Kersey's return to NY City where he open two items--- FIRST--- receipt in the mail of the developed pictures of his now dead wife taken on a vacation they had shortly before she was killed, where she posed for him in a bathing suit on the beach in various mockingly sexy poses.SECOND---Kersey opens the present given to him by Ames Jainchill upon his departure from Texas. And what is it? A gun.Kersey decides to go for a walk with the gun. The result: he shoots a depraved drug addict who tries to rob him, in the stomach, leaving the scuzzbag writhing on the ground.Kersey goes home and throws up. But he learns from this how to do the job better. After that he always shoots his victims twice, eliminating any writhing.The police inspector character played by Vincent Gardenia, with his constant asthma attacks, is a strong antagonist to Bronson's character.The scene is telling where they finally meet face to face at the end of the film.This film is not for leftwingers, members of the ACLU, etc.It is for those who choose not to submit and those who choose not to offer their exposed throats to those who would destroy them.",Death Wish

Not that much happens in this movie, to be honest. It's a good movie, don't get me wrong. It makes very good points about vigilantism and the blur between revenge and justice, which makes it worth a watch for sure.

The action is believable, the police work actually would make sense and Charles Bronson was flat out terrific as the lead.

Maybe not as extreme as like First Blood or Predator or The Terminator but there really wasn't much action. But while you're watching this you can't help to want him to kill. If you don't know what's it about it's like this; Paul's (Charles Bronson) wife is killed by thugs and even though he doesn't know who the thugs are the closest thing he can have to revenge is killing all thugs that come his way. Towards the end he's injured and all the cops want him and one of the cops tells him to get out of New York permanently. It's pretty good but one thing that bothers me is the title of the movie. Do you even know what a death wish is? If you don't (and you should) it's when you want your life to end but you can't go through with suicide.

Bronson's monotone approach actually fits his character and his character's actions very well.

NYC comes across as a very scary place, and in the 1970s, it probably was. Never mind the hip NYC depicted in ""Annie Hall,"" this Big Apple is pretty rotten.

This film has a score by Herbie Hancock, is based on a novel, and features early small roles for Jeff Goldblum and Christopher Guest. Charlie Bronson is actually conflicted in this movie. Honest. It's a drama with a slow build. It's not a great movie, but it's not bad by any means. It's just not anything like it's sequels (well, Charlie kills bad guys in both, but this isn't an action movie). Overall, I'd say that Death Wish is an okay, if dated film that attempts to comment on vigilantism in our culture. It is not a hero-gets-mad-and-kills-stadiums-full-of-bad-guys movie Weird, huh? What's not weird is Jeff Goldblum's role. As you may have suspected, Jeff is actually responsible for all the Death Wish sequels. Jeff, with long hair and a Jughead-style crown hat, leads a gang that robs, beats, and (probably) rapes Charles Bronson's wife and daughter. I don't understand why Charlie never followed Jeff to another movie set and just took care of his grudge once and for all.

Later after learning to shoot and ditching his liberal values Kersey takes to the streets to dispense some real justice! Now this sure does raise some interesting moral questions, but lets face it, we all back Bronson/Kersey, and maybe even secretly admire his actions, at least to some extent. We know that what he does is wrong, but the 'thrill' of revenge and harsh punishment dealt out to criminals sure carries a hell of a punch.

167,mr. sardonicus,A movie for the people,8,16 October 2000,"Death Wish is a movie for all of the people who have to wade through the legends of scum that inhabit the streets of America's urban wasteland. Liberals hate this film because it appeals to a very real desire in many Americans to see the streets ""cleaned up."" It is often portrayed as horribly violent and as nothing more than an ""exploitation"" movie--I'm not so sure that it is either. Yes, the film ""exploits"" the very real feelings people have toward violent wanton crime, but this story could have been a lot more exploitive than it is. Rather than roaming the streets armed to the teeth, as we might see in a more modern film, Paul Kersey takes on the criminals of New York with a .32 revolver. This is not a ""gun nut"" blowing people away with a .44 magnum or a .308, rather it is a guy who knows so little about firearms that he uses a pathetically underpowered gun to defend himself. That's the point of the movie. Paul Kersey is not a Special Forces Vietnam vet returning home to clean up America with overwhelming firepower--he is an architect and a liberal--in other words, just a regular guy. That's what is so forceful about the movie. Most people hold liberal views about criminals and violent crime because they have never had it hit close enough to home to shake them out of their liberal, hypothetical, text-book way of thinking. This movie seeks to do just that. As difficult as the rape scene is to watch, it is absolutely crucial to the plot because it tries to put the audience in the place of an innocent victim of violent crime. Talk to people who have lost children or parents to violent offenders and see if they support liberal coddling of violent criminals--you'll find few that do. Death Wish makes a simple point: if the law can't or won't protect innocent people, then maybe someone else should. Is vigilantism scary? Yes, of course it is, but then so is the liberal tradition of accepting violent crime as a ""normal"" aspect of society. Death Wish is a good movie; it's many sequels are not. Don't confuse the original with the real exploitation movies that follow it.",Death Wish
168,sucks-9,One of Charles Bronson's few magnificent leading roles,9,24 March 2009,"When it comes to the 60s and the 70s in Hollywood, there were only four true badasses of cinema: Clint Eastwood, Steve McQueen, Lee Marvin, and Charles Bronson. And in Charles Bronson's career, there were really only two big highlight films for him: ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" and ""Death Wish"". While his one film with Sergio Leone was amazing, it was ""Death Wish"" that was his vehicle. The film was made for him and it was great at that.

And you're completely on his side when he turns to a life of vigilantism, killing sociopathic muggers, because he is just so believable. Sure, the director Michael Winner may not be one of the greatest directors in the world and sure the other four ""Death Wish"" films really sucked (especially ""The Face of Death""), but at the end of the day when, in ""Death Wish"", Charles Bronson smiles at a group of rowdy kids and mimes firing a gun at them, you have to shut up and let the king of badasses do his work.",Death Wish
169,donovan74,Classy well made top notch thriller.,10,20 September 2007,"INTRO Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson) is a successful architect who turns vigilante after his wife and daughter are ferociously attacked by a gang of violent thugs in their New York city apartment.Set in the mean streets of New York city, Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson) plays a man completely overcome by the horrific assault on his family,with that his comfortable professional life comes to an abrupt end. When the police are slow to respond, Paul Kersey (Bronson) takes the law into his own hands and sets out seeking revenge by himself with a revolver, prowling for muggers on the crime ridden mean city streets at night. It's not long before he becomes a well known vigilante in the city by both the cheering residents and the sympathetic police who funny enough actually see the urban crime rate start to fall in the city.MY VIEWS Being a fan of the late, great Charles Bronson I enjoyed ""Death Wish"" very much with it's exciting quick pace and engaging music by Herbie Hancock, builds the tempo for a great powerful 70's classic thriller. Charles Bronson, is extremely well cast in this film as he plays a gentle professional family man Paul Kersey who is driven to complete despair when his family is set opon by savage thugs. There are at times some very graphic and violent moments, but this being directed and co-produced by Michael Winner is to be expected. The atmosphere when Bronson is prowling on the streets, subways of New York stalking the thugs is both chilling and enthralling. Death Wish was the film in my opinion that made Charles Bronson shine at his best and that would also spark off 4 ""Death Wish"" sequels 3 of which were directed by Michael Winner, but sadly none living up to the engrossing original. Also watch out for a young Jeff Goldblum (The Fly) on his debut playing one of the key violent thugs.DVD INFO Film : 93mins Widescreen : 1.78 Sound : Mono Subtitles : English, Dutch, Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish Rating : 18SUMMARY A violent but yet powerful film ""Death Wish"" is the best vigilante film ever made in my opinion. With the help of great directing from Michael Winner this film will captivate you for the full 93mins, as the good guy (Charles Bronson) seeks revenge on the city streets stalking the muggers and thugs. You'll find yourself cheering in a strange sort of way when he blasts the bad guys to kingdom come. Death Wish is NOT just another brainless shoot-em-up but a classy well made top notch thriller and the fact this film was made back in the 1970's is a plus, as it just gives it more style. I would thoroughly recommend this film although it will not be to everyone's taste it's still one not to be missed. 9/10",Death Wish

A far cry from the situation laid out in Death Wish, where the main character, being an over-civilized middle age man living in the ""toilet"" New-York, visits the homely cozy Arizona and comes to terms with his reluctance towards fire arms. Today, he'd be safer staying in New-York than going to a modern-day frontier high crime Arizona. What irony time can produce! Bronson is Bronson here, one can say that the final image of Bronson is fully developed here. Some of the acting here though are wooden and plain ridiculous, but when the inner action man in Bronson, and in You as a spectator, takes over, the film delivers, and is highly effective. One can easily imagine the controversy it must have stirred being made in the progressive era of social awareness. Herb Alperts score is lush and enjoyable, and the cinematography is competent enough to generate an eerie feeling when the lonely vigilante is roaming the streets.

171,emran222,Possibly the Film that Started the Whole Revenge Film Craze,7,25 May 2011,"I remember Seeing ""Death Wish"" like 5 or 6 years ago on TV one night, where it was heavily Edited for obvious Reasons, especially after seeing the Uncut version on DVD just recently. Which brings me to writing this review, How does the movie hold up? Well when i first saw it on TV I enjoyed it, but i was only like 16 and kinda didn't see how deep the film really was, and being a big film buff I decided to rent it out and see it again along with It's Sequels (which I'll review also)Now after seeing it again, this time uncut It really is an Important Film to see.The Plot involves an everyday man Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson) who's Wife And Daughter are Brutally Raped and Murdered by a gang of thugs (One Played by Jeff Goldblum in an early role) Kersey is unsatisfied with the police not being able to do much to catch them so he gets himself a Pistol and Decides to Take the law into his own hands by taking vengeance on any Street Punk trying to Rob or Kill him and any other innocent Victims.The Film makes You feel Paul Kersey's Pain and you're Left feeling Truly Sorry for him, But in the end you'll be Questioning whether it was right for Kersey to go off killing Random Street Punks who are robbing him or other helpless victims, one may classify it as Self Defence but other's may say there are other Options available when Being Robbed, however i don't like to think too much about it, I would just have to say that Paul Kersey was a man pushed to the limit at a point in his life when everything seemed to be going right until the walls of his life Came Crashing Down because a bunch of Vile and Remorseless Criminals Killed His Wife and Raped His Daughter. Death Wish is a Gritty Film that is packed With Emotion in Which Charles Bronson makes you feel, He truly is the main Attraction to the film, the atmosphere Director Michael Winner Adds to the film is incredible, new york has never looked so gloomy and the Score by Herbie Hancock is really fitting to this film, the only Problem I have is that the Film has some Slow Moments and an Bitter/Sweet Ending Which Might Disappoint a Few people, but aside from that, this film is excellent, And Due to its Success It spawned 4 sequels and a string of other similarly themed films.NOTE: To People who are easily Disturbed By Brutality and Rape, Please Be Cautious.OVERALL: 8/10",Death Wish
172,mrushkoski,A Movie for the Ages,7,30 April 2018,"Filmed in 1974, Death Wish was a good movie for its time. The cinematography was sub par and the plot was decent however the lesson it's trying to teach us is sublime! The main character's wife has been murdered and he decides to do something about it as a vigilante. He begins going out and posing as an easy target for criminals only to shoot them dead when he's provoked. Criminals can't do anything to stop him and through the majority of the film neither can the cops. 
The lesson we learn in 1974, just before the end of the Vietnam war that has divided americans young and old, is that a happy medium is needed in order to move forward as a nation. The older generations sense or law and order is still relevant however it needs to be more flexible, whereas the younger generations free spirited way of life is immoral and must have some type of boundaries.",Death Wish
173,simon-harris20,"We're not Pioneers any more, Dad!",6,5 October 2012,"This Bronson movie asks some of the right questions about vigilantism, but most people will remember it for its action scenes shot in a dark and somewhat dirty New York. It is not a straightforward morality tale, and the protagonist is not punished for his crimes at the end of the story. The truth is, you get to root for Bronson as a mild mannered architect who through personal tragedy discovers the catharsis of violent revenge. The movie doesn't glamorise vigilantism, and through Gardenia's cop weighs the balance of Bronson's revenge against the prospect of law abiding people everywhere taking up arms and settling their own grudges. It's an interesting film, given substance by Bronson and Gardenia, but particularly Bronson, who escalates from helplessness, to anger, to retribution. He is not a hero. He is an ordinary man pushed too far but it all starts to go off the rails when Bronson's deeply personal revenge catches the imagination of New Yorkers and his actions are broadcast on TV. Street crime drops radically. It puts the viewer in an awkward position, because Bronson's Paul Kersey is a sympathetic character, you want him to have his measure of revenge, coupled with the ironic situation that he is seemingly cutting violent crime as muggers and thieves stay off the streets. The prospect of summary justice dispensed by a grief stricken man with a gun should frighten us all, but we can't help sympathising with Kersey who has been badly wronged. Civilised he may be, but there is still a part of him that finds his son in law's solution of cut and run to be the act of a coward. An entertaining movie with good set pieces and action scenes. Bronson is as solid as ever and Gardenia's policeman is one of the stronger points of the film, and the scenes when both actors are on the screen together are credible and watchable. Due to this films success it spawned several sequels, the first Death Wish II coming some twelve years later. However the later films were made for an 80's audience and as a result all of the violence and sex had to be harder and more graphic than even this film to reflect the changes in the viewing public that took place in that twelve year period. This is the original and best, and it turned Bronson into a superstar.",Death Wish
174,braindog,Bronson is the Man,8,24 February 2005,"Before god awful pieces of trash like The Punisher, there was another film that showed a man who's wife was murdered by a gang and wanted justice, but wanted to deliver it in his own way. That film was Death Wish. And instead of a hero that didn't seem to care too much about this killing (though it was mostly just the actor, Tom Jane)we had the cool three dimensional Charles Bronson. You may ask yourself, ""three dimensional?"". And I say ""sure"" he cried about his wife before he went on to kill a great many scum bags on the streets of New York. The bottom line is that Bronson was a bad ass in this film and all the rest of the Death Wish films which I also enjoy very much. We know that this movie will be great from the beginning when Bronson cashes in a 20 dollar bill for two rolls of quarters so that he can stuff them in a sock and smash it across some dude's face. It's brilliant. They don't do they kind of raw action in movies anymore, and I guess that's why this movie can be so refreshing even if it was made in the seventies. There's no doubt that anyone who appreciates good action flicks with a bad ass main character will appreciate THIS movie the way I do.",Death Wish
175,Hellraiserdisciple,Once upon a vigilante...,8,20 August 2010,"The vigilante sub-genre is an interesting one. While I can't say that I really approve of it, it simultaneously fills me with great feeling of satisfaction. And who couldn't possibly enjoy seeing scummy criminals receive their just desert? Revenge/justice feels even more rewarding when it comes in the shape of man-of-steel Charles Bronson.Even though the movie is titled Death Wish I think it shows remarkable restraint when it comes to living up to its name. It all starts nice and quietly with Paul Kersey (Bronson) and wife Joanna (Hope Lange) on vacation. Yes, they are happily married and have a great daughter. Life sure is good for Paul and family. Well, it's good until about the 20 minute mark when Joanna is brutally beaten and their daughter is brutally raped. The assault is suitably uncomfortable, with Jeff Goldblum debuting as one of the rapists. One thing that has always struck me about this scene is seeing the daughter getting her ass spray-painted by one of the assailants. There is something about how they do it, like she was an inanimate object that disturbs and puzzles me. The end result is Joanna dying in the hospital and their daughter sent into a catatonic state. Paul is a peaceful man (aren't they always?), but is frustrated by the inactions of the police. He starts noticing just what a jungle New York City really is. In an attempt to give Paul other things to think about, his business partners send him out of state to work on a real estate project. He complies and is introduced to the ways of old justice. It's done in a clever fashion at an old western town for tourists. We see the courageous sheriff kill all the robbers. Bronson stares at the show and you know what he's thinking. As a gift for helping out with the real estate project he is given a very nice looking Colt revolver. Kersey goes back to New York. Of course it doesn't take long before he uses it. After an initial panic attack he realizes that killing the scum of the earth is actually a decent way of spending an evening and so he continues. Along the way he receives praise from the public inspiring people to take the law into their own hands. I think in the short time span we see Paul and Joanna together their relationship is very well established. Paul receiving their vacation pictures after she's dead works great as the catalyst for his call to arms. We see what he had and then we see him opening the box containing the gun. The violence in Death Wish is never gratuitous. He shoots the criminals and that is it. Kersey even has a rather modest body count with ten dead bad-guys. Fortunately Kersey was only warming up. The Death Wish sequels provide gratuitous violence and nudity aplenty. I like that they go for a more crude approach, but I equally appreciate the first one for its restraint in brutality. One of the truly exhilarating things about Death Wish is seeing Kersey go hunting after developing a taste for vigilantism. The villains approach. They feel confident. Of course they do. He is just an old man. What could he possibly do? Guess again punks! This is one man you do NOT want to mess with. I'm simply unable to stop grinning as Kersey leads them on. It's a diabolical cat and mouse game, where both parties believe they are the cat. Another thing I really enjoy about Death Wish is that the ones responsible for the deeds against Kersey's family are never caught by the police. Paul doesn't make any effort in trying to find them either. Instead he turns on the underbelly of New York in general. All of them must pay for their collective effort in destroying the lives of honest, hard working people. As for leading man Charles Bronson, I have nothing but praise. He makes a believable character you can relate to. And when it comes to serving up justice there is no man harder or better to do the job. While action stars like Schwarzenegger and Willis provides muscles and attitude to their characters Bronson doesn't play hard. He IS hard. Some will argue that he's acting is stiff, but I think his restraint (or inability to overact) is his strength. Just look at those squinting eyes. He could stare you to death if he wanted to.Part of what makes Death Wish memorable is how politically incorrect it is. While the mayor wants him stopped he doesn't want him arrested either. They can't make a martyr out of the guy. So instead the police cover it up and make Kersey leave town. Neither the police, nor Kersey shows much confidence in the justice system. Is it okay to take the law into your hands? Death Wish goes a long way in saying yes.",Death Wish
176,johnscook,Why is this so good?,3,27 December 2005,"I've seen this movie twice and I cannot figure out why so many people think it is such a good movie. They must be die-hard Charles Bronson fans who would love any Charles Bronson movie just because it has Charles Bronson in it.I just don't believe that Bronson played the character of Paul Kersey very well, or he wasn't directed very well (or both). At the scene of his wife's burial he shows no emotion at all. He didn't serve in the military because he was a conscientious objector, and his wife was just brutally murdered in their own home. His daughter was also assaulted and left mentally incapacitated. Yet, he shows no emotion. He handles the whole scene like he is leaving work and telling his co-workers ""see you tomorrow"". I guess if you are looking for the ultimate Bronson-esquire mental detachment from reality, this is it. Unfortunately, he doesn't even play the scene like he is detached, like he is about to mentally go off the deep end.He opposed his involvement in the military and he doesn't own a weapon and, presumably, never has. Yet, when he has the first opportunity to fire a weapon he nearly hits the bullseye. Right. It's not like he has natural ability, making a few mistakes and then we see him taking a few weeks to sharpen his skills - no, the first round out of the weapon is ready to kill. At least when this happens in a Schwarzenegger movie, we realize that the movie is poking a little fun at itself and we chuckle a little. There is nothing to chuckle at in this movie. Nothing is tongue-in-cheek in this movie.During the 1970s the crime rate in New York City was high, but it still wasn't like anything portrayed in this movie. Death Wish would have you believing that in 1974 in NYC that there was a criminal around every corner and on every subway car waiting to pounce on a victim. They would have you believe that 8 out of every 10 citizens were getting mugged. Not only is this not a fact, it's beyond fiction. I realize that the premise of the movie requires crime, but the movie portrays the crime rate so high that you have to wonder why it takes somebody who doesn't own a gun to become a vigilante. If the crime rate were really that high, even for 1974, there would have been hundreds of Bernie Goetz's running around NYC. Paul Kersey wouldn't even have had the opportunity to be a crime victim, much less become a vigilante.At least they did portray Paul Kersey's first act of vigilantism somewhat realistically. I would believe that Paul Kersey would go home and vomit after hitting a stranger, albeit a criminal, in the skull with 2 rolls of quarters and leaving him for dead. It's a stretch to think that he could be transformed into a vengeful killer without any other thing happening to him (other than being given a weapon to use). His wife was just murdered yet he goes from quarter-roll clubbings to deadly-accurate assaults with a firearm. No further mental transformation was required. Right.He is also completely detached from his daughter's mental incapacity. There is only one scene where he shows any emotion over her predicament, and it occurs well after her assault and it is displaced. When he is trying to be upbeat to disguise his anger, and then he shows an outburst of anger, the anger and its disguise are just not believable. Death Wish wouldn't pass muster as an average made-for-TV movie. The supporting roles are either played over the top or without sufficient emotion to tell us what they are really thinking. Why don't we see more discussion from the city officials about how to handle the vigilante situation? Oh, right, that would take up valuable screen time for Bronson to randomly murder criminals that he entraps.I'm really surprised by Roger Ebert's 3-star rating. He must be an avid Charles Bronson fan. This is a poorly made movie.",Death Wish
177,tom_bombadillo-1,Classic That Started a Genre,10,1 August 2009,"This film was followed by four sequels, it was the inspiration for the ""The Brave One"", and was the first of the vigilante genre. At the time of this film's release it featured themes that had already been seen by movie goers at the time, but in a more controversial way. The rape scene was very graphic for that time period and in someways, still is today. It is also noteworthy, that this is one of, if not the first movies to drop a ""C"" bomb. I like how all of the bad guys are the same. Like, why do they all jump around like they belong to the ministry of silly walks? I'm not sure why that is, but as the film series progressed the bad guys did get a little more realistic.",Death Wish

179,deathwishryo,Death Wish - The original and best vigilante film,10,1 January 2020,"Death Wish (1974)
Genre: Thriller
Sub Genre: Action ThrillerDeath Wish is the story of New York architect, Paul Kersey's descent into vigilantism, after a traumatic and vicious gang attack on his wife and daughter.There is a lot of social comment but also a psychological aspect which comes through very strong, showing the main character's hunger for vengeance.
Kersey increasingly strays from his business persona the longer the film goes on, essentially becoming a broken man living on the edge.
The increasing problematic issues of having a double life, take its toll the more Kersey gets dragged into this dark world.Death Wish is the perfect vigilante film, it doesn't need to rely on gore or total violence.
Almost like the Halloween of the action genre, in that it is fairly slow paced, but generates suspense and atmosphere. It concentrates more on the dramatic aspect than soley on just violence.
With the late great Charles Bronson and Vincent Gardenia, both excellent in their respective roles as Paul Kersey and the Chief Inspector.Death Wish has a lot of classy elements within which make the first film such a must see. Such as a real building sense of unease, a brilliant score and memorable performances from the two main leads.Death Wish is a thought provoking, drama thriller and one which stands out from many in its style and intent. Later sequels would abandon many of the subtle nuances contained in Death Wish, but the first remains a must watch classic film.Ranking: 10/10#FilmReview #FilmReviews

180,sanjuro-12,The Father of Vigilante Movies. Quintessential Bronson.,8,31 July 1999,"The father of vigilante movies. The quintessential Charles Bronson flick. There have been many attempts in Bronson's career to duplicate the success of this film,(""10 to Midnight, ""The Evil That Men Do"", ""Kinjite"", The four ""Death Wish"" sequels, etc) but not one has resonated with the same impact as this cooly calculated chiller. The story is familiar. Bleeding heart liberal turns vigilante after his family is attacked and wife murdered. Despite the disturbing promotion for gun ownership and taking the law into your own hands, the filmmakers did take certain measures to imply Bronson's ill state of mind, as Bronson's character recites old Western movie cliche`s such as ""Draw"", when cornering a prospective mugger. Or by the film's closing when ineffectual Cop Gardenia orders Bronson to get out of town, Bronson responds, ""By Sundown Sheriff?"", further illustrating a Man whose sense of reality is blurred by the fantasy of the Old West, where Men protected their homes and families. A little exploitive here and there (Those graphic rape scenes are pretty tough to take), but otherwise a worthwhile venture into the mind of a once simple man pushed too far.",Death Wish

182,goldenhairedone,A hard to resist revenge flick,7,26 January 2005,"Although being known for practically starting the vigilante genre, ""Death Wish"" is not the daring masterpiece one would expect from a ""first"" in cinema. But it is a entertaining little picture, predictable but entertaining, poorly acted yet impassioned, and with a clever use of a society that was already becoming obsessed with serial killers, ideas that would later be used to full effect in films such ""Natural Born Killers"" and ""Man Bites Dog"". Unfortunately, in this movie it's more of just a plot device to have a happier ending.Which is probably just what this movie needed. Even in the optimistic early scenes of Paul(Charles Bronson) together with his wife Joanna(Hope Lange) have a very dry and lifeless feel to them. This of course goes from bad to worse when she is brutally killed by three random hooligans. Their daughter survives but is raped in the process and becomes a vegetable for the rest of the movie.Surprisingly, Bronson does not immediately grab the closest gun in sight. He just kind of shuffles around mourning over his family. Filmmakers would basically get rid of this type of scene in all subsequent films of this genre, including the ""Death Wish"" sequels. Probably for the best though, as they become dead weight in a genre not known for it's emotional side. Afterwards though, is when the real movie begins. And not to spoil anything, but he kills a lot of people. All the while the media eats it up, causing many New Yorkers to proclaim him a present day hero.If it weren't for these last 30 minutes, this film would not receive it's present score. Instead its a soulless B-movie, but with a healthy amount of action and Bronson at top form. For better or worse, this is truly one of the best of it's kind.",Death Wish

184,DaveduFresne80,A Great film and by Far the best of the series!,10,18 February 2021,"For the average movie buff, you should watch this and probably stop here. Those who are Bronson fans or just like violence can continue to watch the next 20 years of sequels.Interestingly, despite my rating I believe Bronson was miscast (for the first film alone). He just looks too tough to have been a liberal conscientious objector as portrayed in the film. I'm not saying liberal conscientious objectors can't be tough, but we don't picture them looking like Bronson, let's be honest.But Bronson does his best acting work here, and he pretty well sells the character. He is a happily married architect, whose wife is killed and daughter raped so brutally she essentially becomes comatose. Since this movie is pre DNA and also tries to be realistic, there is no chance of Bronson finding the killers/rapists. Nor does he intend to at first. But once he realizes the police aren't going to do their job and his son in law calls just accepting things being ""civilized"" Bronson decides enough is enough.He goes to the bank and gets two rolls of quarters to put in a sock for defense against muggers. Apparently 1970s New Yorker was absolutely filled with them and as one soon accosts him, he flings the heavy sock in the guy's face and the mugger runs off.His firm later sends him to the Southwest to improve a western architect's project. They work together well, but they also spend some off time together where the westerner explains how a gun is just a tool, and an armed society is a polite one. We find out that prior to being a CO, Bronson was once a crack shot and still is, apparently his father dying in a hunting accident was what inspired him to put the guns away for good. The westerner is so happy with Bronson's environmentally friendly constructions that he gifts him an expensive gun and ammunition.Bronson returns to NY with it and quickly starts gunning down muggers, rapists and people beating the elderly. Once he catches them committing a crime there is no mercy. The film does transition a bit showing him having regret and disgust at his first kill, but after that he quickly adapts. All the kills are realistic in this one, you could argue he got lucky in one or two, but very plausible.The funny thing is, the city of New York, which showed little interest in solving Bronson's case is very interested in finding out who the ""vigilante"" is and eventually calls for him to turn himself in. Bronson gives a great smirk when he sees the TV news calling for that. In reality they don't want to arrest him, they hope his work will continue to scare off muggers until they can get their own methods put to better use. But they do want him out of NY as countless bodies aren't leaving the best press.The police inspector, who played a kind of house husband possibly gay character in All in the Family does a good job here. He tracks Bronson down, gets his gun and convinces him to leave.But the great ending reveals Bronson is hardly finished. Some punks harass his daughter as he disembarks in Chicago showing sexual gestures towards her. He stares them down, and points a finger ""gun"" at them while he figuratively blows them away.The film shows that when the police don't do their duty, the citizens must step up. The negative side is probably the effect on the Bronson character who seems to lose much of his humanity as time goes by, but who can blame him. I think it was unrealistic that he could keep getting serious love interests in following films. Not because he was old, despite looking tough he had a charming voice and an alpha presence, but I think someone out for revenge would want to keep women and children out of the way. In this film though there is no care for his own interests, just raw revenge.",Death Wish
185,Whackooyzero,"Not Bronson's best, but better than a lot of his later work.",7,22 November 2010,"Charles Bronson is truly one of the greatest action stars to ever live, but unfortunately he was never one for choosing roles. For every ""Rider On The Rain"", ""Red Sun"", ""The Mechanic"", ""Mr. Majestyk"", or ""Hard Times"" there was a good deal more movies like ""Cold Sweat"", ""Love And Bullets"", ""St. Ives"", and all of his 80's material(though I admit to liking Death Wish 3 and 4 as b movie ridiculousness). Now My point is, many will tell you ""Death Wish"" is his masterpiece, and though I don't quite agree it's undeniably the best of the series and does show that he had hidden acting skills that unfortunately weren't tested often enough.Everyone knows the story by now: Architect Paul Kersey, when coming home from work finds that his wife and daughter have been raped. He then goes on a business trip where a guy there re arouses Kersey's interest in guns, he comes home where he finds said guy gave him a gun for a present. Kersey uses it in self defense at first against the mugger, and finds he gets great relief in it. He then begins posing as mugger bait for revenge on the kind of people that raped his wife and daughter.It's a pretty good movie. The action is restrained, and has a lot of suspense in it leading up to the actual killing, the dialogue is surprisingly well written given the genre, and it's quite compelling. Though I give it an 7, it's really more of a 7.4. The thing that makes it above average is it really shows the effect violence can have on someone, and the how someone will attempt to escape their problems through it. Sure it seems like he's solving the problem to him, but as the movie unfolds you certainly get a sense of the wrongness in his actions. Self defense is one thing, getting revenge is one thing, taking it out on a large group of people whom despite being a problem and a nuisance, don't quite deserve death.It's a well told story, but the points it's trying to make are hard to find at first, and could have been done slightly more effectively, but it's nevertheless a pretty good movie. But the reason it isn't Bronson's best is because it doesn't quite succeed at doing what it sets out to do but also because he has movies like ""Once Upon A Time In The West""(his masterpiece), ""Hard Times"", and ""Red Sun"" which are my personal favorites and I would argue far outclass this. Nevertheless it's a very enjoyable movie thanks to the strong performances, good screenplay, well done action scenes, and a great score.",Death Wish

Those of us old enough to have seen it then can understand what I am talking about. There was a great deal of 70s mentality in this film hence the term Zeitgeist.  Urban squalor, violence, apathy, and fear permeate this movie, and were big political issues at the time.  During the police investigation, one of the key suspect groups suggested by the Chief of Police was the Vietnam vet - nothing like serving your country faithfully.  The Vietnam War was just over, and the Vietnam vets were viewed as potential psychos for any number of reasons real or imagined.  The police in NYC are always an easy target, and are shown as being ineffectual.  In one scene on the subway, two thugs enter the car, and the cop moves away from them to another car.As the movie unfolds, Bronson's wife is murdered and the daughter is raped into catatonia during a robbery at their apartment.  Bronson feels hopeless for a time after dealing with the system.  A work related trip to Tucson breathes some life into him.  He comes back to NYC with a pistol a client had given him as a surprise gift.  One night while walking, a junkie tries to rob him, and becomes Bronson's first vigilante kill.  Thereafter several shooting and deaths occur as others try to rob him.  The police figure out that they must have a vigilante on their hands -- even a blind pig can find an acorn.  The crime rates plummet, people begin to stand up to the muggers, and the cops start getting scared.By some miracle, the police trim the list down to Bronson.  The Police Chief in charge of the investigation is called in by the DA and other bigwigs for a chat.  They tell the Chief that they don't want the vigilante because of all of the publicity the he has gotten.  Apparently the public loves him, and cops don't want to look really bad by not being to protect people and then arresting the one person that is fighting back and inspiring others to do the same.  They instruct the Chief to ""scare him off"".
The Chief tries to scare him off, but only makes his point after Bronson has been shot and has no other choice.  Bronson makes a bon mot by stating the obvious -- get out of town before sundown.This movie, while presenting all the darker elements of human nature, is a good movie from a historical perspective and proving once again ""revenge"" will always sell theatre tickets!",Death Wish

At one point the in Oregon the average punishment for murder was not only not capital, but only an average of seven years in prison.Nationwide exoneration statistics for justifiable shooting homicides are slightly higher for civilians than for police, counter-intuitive as that may seem. I believe that to be attributable to the fact that civilians generally shoot only when they must, not when they may. Having personally been involved in law enforcement for 28 ½ years, I would like to offer some valuable insight to ""Death Wish"" either deliberately covered up, as in the movie, or not generally made available to the public. ""Street justice"" really DOES deter crime. We see this here in Portland, Oregon, whenever a homeowner kills a burglar inside his house. If publicized as such, the burglary rate temporarily dips due to the felons' realization that killing a burglar in the act is justifiable under Oregon law. (In fact, any burglar who enters your home while you are there is a cat burglar, and is significantly dangerous and generally armed...you would be a fool not to kill him. Charles Manson cat burgled as a game he called ""creepy-crawling,"" and he went on to murder about three dozen people, if that tells you anything about the mentality of this particular brand of felon. Read ""Helter Skelter."")As depicted in ""Death Wish,"" the reduction of crime rate is entirely realistic as a deterrence to ""muggers"" (translation = armed robbers).",Death Wish
191,john_phelan911,Vigilante Man,9,19 December 2007,"When Michael Winner asked the late Charles Bronson if he'd like to star in his new movie 'Death Wish', about a mild mannered chap who goes on a rampage shooting scumbags when his family is attacked, Bronson replied ""Id like to do that"". ""The movie?"" Winner enquired, ""No"", responded Bronson, ""Shoot some scumbags"". When it was released in 1974, Death Wish stirred up enormous controversy. With its violent rape scene and apparent condoning of Paul Kersey's vigilante activities, Vincent Canby of the New York Times called it ""one of the sickest movies ever made"", claiming that it ""raises complex questions in order to offer bigoted, frivolous, oversimplified answers"".The films message in enunciated best by Kersey in conversation with his wet blanket of a son in law; ""What do you call people who, when they're faced with a condition of fear, run away?"". His son sheepishly asks ""Civilised?"". In the west, society works on the understanding that when members of the public are done wrong, the State, which holds the monopoly on legitimate violence, takes peoples rights of revenge and retribution on itself. With this comes the caveat that the State is duty bound to exercise this right of revenge and retribution. But, as this film poses, what are we supposed to do when the authorities rescind this right, and by definition the rights of victims and the public, in the face of left wing/liberal notions of fairness for crooks? When the police don't protect us, who does?For those who think this film silly, just look at the case of British farmer Tony Martin. Repeatedly burgled and repeatedly told by the police that they were powerless to act, Martin shot one burglar dead and wounded another when his home was broken into again. Unlike the burglars, Martin was arrested and sent to jail. The burglar who escaped was subsequently given legal aid to sue Martin. In Death Wish the police spend considerably more time trying to apprehend Kersey than the scum he is after. This is provocative political film making of the highest calibre, not far behind Pontecorvo's 'Battle of Algiers' and Costa Gavras' 'Z'. Some criticise the film for the ease with which Bronson finds muggers. As the Canadian film critic Mark Steyn wrote, ""To be sure, he sort of goes looking for trouble. But in 1970's New York you didn't have to look far: just go to the park, ride the subway, take an evening stroll"". This great movie loses one star only because it is not quite as good as the similarly themed 'Dirty Harry'. There are a couple of problems with this movie. Charles Bronson is too macho an actor for the role of ""bleeding heart liberal"" turned vigilante Paul Kersey. He looks like a killer from frame one, and as a result his transformation is a little hard to swallow. A more normal looking actor might have been more believable, as Dustin Hoffmann demonstrates in 'Straw Dogs'. It also suffers in comparison to the book. The back story about a gun fighting father, introduced in the movie, is plain daft, and the police investigation in the film, which tracks Kersey down in pretty short order, feels tacked on and ill thought out. The ending of the book is better also. Called Paul Benjamin in the book, the Bronson character is caught red handed by a police officer. The officer removes his hat, turns his back and allows the Vigilante to escape. Oochoa gets nowhere near him in the book.Ask yourself the question posed on the back of the paperback version of the book; ""What do you do when your life lies in ruins and fear clutches at your heart? Do you shun the city and flee from its violence? Or do you do what Paul did - get a gun, learn to use it and start fighting back?""",Death Wish
192,kernanj-53-367542,"Good plot, bad directing",6,25 July 2014,"There were many things wrong with this movie, the directing being the most major one I think. The first issue was the villains. Their sneaking around was pathetically comical. They were slamming their feet on the ground and smashing through doors, in an attempt to be stealthy. Not to mention their lines were pathetic. The scene changes were awkward. Sometimes it would just cut out at a seemingly random point in a scene and insert you into another random point in a scene without any style. Charles Bronson is wooden. He definitely shouldn't have been cast in this role, this movie was meant to be too dramatic for him. For a combat veteran he seemed kind of shaky after fighting off a mugger. Great picture quality for a 70's movie though. Once he starts fighting crime the movie starts becoming better, probably because they shied away from the dramatic scenes which they had no skill in crafting. 6/10",Death Wish
193,moles12,A Fine Film,7,17 September 2003,"This was a very enjoyable movie. It's a great theme of a man who has felt the effects of violence and will not sit back and be helpless, he will instead take action. The movie greatly captured the grim society and low morale of the 1970's.The graphic murder and rape of Bronson's wife and daughter was effective because it made Bronson a sympathetic character. Which made it real fun when old man Bronson goes around shooting punks.As everyone knows, there has been a lot of criticism of the movie for being pro-violence, fascist, etc. But it's important to remember that it is JUST A MOVIE!The movie was only 90 or so minutes long, and at the end the routine of Bronson going out, getting mugged, and then shooting someone got a bit tiring. Which is why this series should have ended with the first. Although the sequels were fun, just not that good. :)Bronson was fine, but his lack of acting range did hurt the film. More emotion would have fit the part well. Bronson was at his finest in Once Upon a Time In The West, as a mysterious man with unclear motives. Bronson's strength in this film showing the weariness and sadness of his situation.
The movie dealt with heavy and controversial subject matter, which made the light-hearted and goofy ending absolutely perfect. 7/10",Death Wish
194,frankahern3030,Best action film?,10,13 February 2021,"Great dark and gritty movie. Charles bronson does say much, but he doesn't need to. His gun does all the talking. 80,s action dont compare to current PG13 CGI crap.",Death Wish
195,fournierda,Police response makes no sense,8,16 March 2021,"Recognizing first that this is a work of fiction, nothing about the police response in this movie is written well. The response to Media is unbelievable, the labeling of the shootings as murder, when each appears to be a case of justifiable homicide at least to a degree. when threatened with a knife, there is no law that says you have to respond with a knife. Deadly force is deadly force.",Death Wish
196,johnm-12193,Audience manipulation at its zenith,8,6 April 2020,"Death Wish depicts a New York City of a bygone era when crime was apparently so rampant that there was a lowlife waiting around every corner and in every dark alley. The set up is simple, with Charles Bronson as architect Paul Kersey, whose wife and daughter are brutally attacked in their home by muggers. His wife dies from her injuries, and his daughter is left in a catatonic state. Kersey us depicted as an affluent solid citizen and Korean war veteran. Shortly his life is forever altered after the muggings, he copes with the loss in a self contained fashion and does his best to carry on and goes back to work. He is sent on a business trip/ vacation to Arizona to look at a land deal his company is interested in.He meets the developer who turns out to be a gun enthusiast. He tells Paul about the gun culture in the southwest and how nearly every one he knows owns a gun of some kind. He invites Kersey to go to a gun club with an indoor shooting range, where they take turns shooting at targets. They talk a little about their own philosophies on guns and crime. It's a pivotal moment in the film, because up until this point Kersey is depicted as a mostly non violent, somewhat liberal individual. He was also a conscientious objector during his service. As Kersey is about to board his plane back to New York, the developer places two gift wrapped packages in his suitcase as a ""going away present.""When Kersey gets back home, he unwraps the gifts, which turn out to be a pearl handled 32 caliber pistol and ammunition, the same gun he fired at the shooting range. It is at about this point that he goes from being a mild mannered solid citizen to a vigilante. He goes off into the night armed with the gun. He is soon confronted by a robber demanding his money, and after a moment of hesitation, Kersey slowly turns and shoots him. After the shooting, Kersey rushes home and is ill with struggling with the trauma and guilt over what he has done. After this initial killing, he goes on to look for other criminals througout the city and before long, criminals are being killed at an alarming rate. Naturally, the police are noticing that lowlifes and scumbags involved in crimes are being rapidly eliminated.They begin to assemble a task force to deal with the ""problem"" of the vigilante killer. Although as they note muggings in the city are down prodigiously since the killings began, they can't have a vigilante roaming the streets. For what it is, Death Wish is efficiently well made with some good performances. Charles Bronson is perfectly cast as the victim turned vigilante, with some very good supporting acting as well. A good part if the movie is shot at night, heightening the sense of danger in the city at that time. There is a good amount of social commentary interspersed throughout the film as Kersey goes from a law abiding citizen to a vigilante killer. The police are depicted as overburdened and/or ineffective at obtaining justice for innocent victims of crime. So Kersey, feeling unable to obtain justice from the law decides to take the law into his own hands.The original muggers who attacked his family are never seen again. Kersey simply goes on a crusade to make every other criminal he comes into contact with pay for their crimes. The film wraps up with the law catching up with Kersey, but instead of arresting and prosecuting him, they offer him a deal. Get out of New York permanently and we'll forget about everything. Death Wish is very much a product of the time it was made in. While a lot of things in the movie seem naturally pretty dated, it still holds up well. It's well paced and acted, and isn't overly long. I can't imagine anyone other than Charles Bronson in the lead role. Its probably the film he's the most identified with.",Death Wish
197,judomayhem,Sure to annoy liberals,10,20 November 2002,"This is Charles at his best. Always plagued by poor script choices, Death Wish is the film where everything comes together for him. A realistic story of what happens when a liberal suburbanite is smashed with a cold dose of reality. Very violent, but the action fits in seamlessly with the dramatic story line. If Charles could have made more movies of this calibre, he would have the reputation of Clint Eastwood, as his acting and screen presence is at least as good. Charles, as you probably know, was originally slated to be in the first few westerns that made Eastwood famous. The director (Sergio Leone)could not afford Bronson at the time so was forced to go with the unkown Clint. See the excellent ""Once Upon A Time In The West"" as this was the film that Leone and Bronson were finally able to make.",Death Wish

One of the most cornball movies you will ever have the misfortune to see. Two of the three writers didn't even want their names displayed, and one was the director. Too much.

201,kell490,The best of the death wish series,8,12 March 2014,"While today this film is dated it still captures the imagination that it's an American right to bear arms in self defense. It's more then just another action film like the films released today. Bronson plays the part very well his style fits the part well. It's very realistic and doesn't hold back when it shows just how violent rape, and murder can be. I know this film got a lot of criticism about how violent it was very realistic. While the movie progresses the viewer becomes the vigilante Paul Kersey wanting to exact revenge on the criminals who have taken over the city. The movie takes you from emotional lows to highs as Kersey dishes out his form of justice.",Death Wish
202,misskaren2016,This movie was SHOCKING! (Spoiler Alert),10,30 December 2018,"I watched Death Wish again and I was shocked at the rape scene. I've seen this movie many times but I never really took in the details of what happened to the the daughter. This was one of the most vicious attacks on defenseless women that I have ever seen in a movie. Kersey's daughter was subjected to a horrible sexual assault which was so bad that I can't even give details. All I'll say is they treated her like a man. This was just a movie but I was very shaken and upset because these things really do happen.It was really sad the way the mother was attacked, but I admire Hope Lange's character when she tried to help her daughter. To tell the truth, I was almost in tears. This movie was made in 1974 but the shock value, IMO, was intense. It wasn't too politically correct and I appreciate this. I was 5 years old in 1974 and my family lived in Queens, NYC. I hear stories that NYC was dangerous during that time, but I thank God that no one in my family (including relatives) were victims of the type of crime I saw in Death Wish.I recommend that anyone who has not seen Death Wish 1974 should do so, but you may want to fast forward this rape scene or press the Mute button.",Death Wish
