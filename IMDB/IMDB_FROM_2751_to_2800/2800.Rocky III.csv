0,Leofwine_draca,"A slicker beast than the first two, but it still makes for great entertainment",8,3 November 2016,"Another excellent feel-good film in the ROCKY saga that had showed no signs of slowing down by this stage. In fact, I enjoyed it more than the first film and feel that it comes only just behind the second in terms of pure entertainment. Once again, the story takes a new angle, showing how Rocky's fame has changed his life and also put him out of touch with reality. During the course of the film he loses nearly everything, and is then forced to go on a journey of discovery to try and capture what he's lost. The fight at the climax has an inevitable outcome, but perhaps that's why I was looking forward to it so much.The actors are wonderful again. Stallone directs himself with aplomb, focusing on another side of his hero this time around: for the first time ever, Rocky finds himself afraid, and must battle to dispel that fear. Talia Shire and Burt Young don't have much to do, but they provide the stable backbone that Rocky himself requires. Burgess Meredith is excellent once again as the sympathetic Mickey, and Carl Weathers' Apollo Creed undergoes a significant and appealing character shift that sees him switch sides from enemy to ally. Mr. T is so tough as the bad guy Clubber Lang that he's almost a caricature of himself, but that doesn't stop him being thoroughly entertaining, and he's matched by a hulking Hulk Hogan in a brief, crazed turn as an over the top wrestler.The film is well made, has great music – the old favourites as well as new hit Eye of the Tiger – and the training sequences are as fun as ever. The boxing matches are slicker and more stylised than before, but no less enthralling, while Stallone's careful to keep the human drama as his first priority as always. As a result, this is another great film in the series.",Rocky III
1,SnoopyStyle,Cheesetastic Hulk Hogan AND Mr. T,6,4 July 2014,Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is enjoying great success as the defending world champion. His manager Mickey Goldmill (Burgess Meredith) has been picking fighters for him until he is challenged by the arrogant Clubber Lang (Mr. T) at the unveiling of his statue. Lang is exactly the one that Mickey has been avoiding. Rocky not only loses the fight but also Mickey and only Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) can help him recover from the loses.First Rocky fights Hulk Hogan and then he fights Mr. T. It doesn't get more cheesetastic 80s than that. The story has all the iconic Rocky formula. He is put into an underdog position and he has an insurmountable hurdle to overcome. And Rocky has to have an opponent above all. Mr. T serves that purpose. The movie's big move has to be killing off Mickey and bringing back Apollo as now a good guy. It's a brilliant move. This is a mix of good 80s cheese and a broadly written sports movie.,Rocky III
2,classicsoncall,"""Nothing is real if you don't believe in who you are"".",8,14 March 2010,"You can't fault the Rocky films for being so similar to each other. They had a tried and true successful formula with a likable protagonist in a setting where the underdog had to overcome long odds to come out a winner. It's no different here, and Stallone manages to get it all done in under two hours. The fresh aspect offered in this film involve the Hulk Hogan appearance as a pro wrestling heel, and the presence of Mr.T in the flick that would propel him to 'Pity the Fool' stardom. I would have liked to see Burgess Meredith carry on as Mickey, but death in movies isn't always what it seems. You've got ""Rocky V"" to attest to that.So this is the Rocky film in which Stallone is really ripped due to a personal training regimen, and perhaps owing somewhat to that 'Eye of the Tiger' theme song that we hear repeatedly. It's overly done in my estimation, but it worked for this entry in the series. I know that by this time a lot of folks were panning the series and Stallone personally, but there must be something to it as the Rocky films are a ubiquitous presence today on a variety of cable channels. My favorite would still be the original ""Rocky"", but in sequels, the franchise has enough to offer for viewers if taken one at a time, each with it's own message of hope and inspiration.",Rocky III
3,gavin6942,Such Fun!,7,12 August 2015,"After winning the ultimate title and being the world champion, Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) falls into a hole and finds himself picked up by a former enemy (Carl Weathers).The first film was serious, the second one was more humorous and light-hearted. This one has a few emotional bumps (someone important dies), a bit of a humanization for Apollo Creed (sudden;y a good guy), and some over-the-top absurd humor (Thunder Lips). It is a good mix.Although few would agree, I believe the second film is superior to the first. The third is beneath both of them, but not by much. It is a welcome addition to the series, which they likely never thought would last nearly as long as it does.",Rocky III
4,jboothmillard,Rocky III,5,26 March 2011,"Directed by its star Sylvester Stallone, the first film may be the one that was the most successful, winning Oscars and all, but this one gave us two things, a memorable TV star and a hit song. Basically it continues where the previous film left off, where Rocky Balboa (Stallone) defeated Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) by knockout, falling over and winning getting up, by one second, and he is still enjoying his success. Three years have passed, he has had ten fights holding onto his world champion title, and he is now rich with everything he could ever want. After a charity boxing match against World Wrestling Champion fighter Thunderlips (Hollywood Hulk Hogan) and a commemorative statue in his honour and that of his home town, Rocky announces his retirement. Right at that moment however out of the crowd comes the man who has been watching him with intent to fight him and become the new world champion, up and coming boxing brawler Clubber Lang (Mr. T), and with too much pride he accepts. At first trainer Mickey Goldmill (Burgess Meredith) is strict that he should not fight him, because he is a ""killer"", and he confesses the ten fights he got him were easy compared to Clubber, but he does agree eventually to give him more fighting tips. It comes to the match, but before it even starts Rocky and Clubber have backstage bust-up, resulting in Mickey having a heart attack, initially Rocky says he will forfeit, but his trainer urges him to go on. In the end, Rocky was too worried about Mickey to fight as well as he normally would, therefore he is defeated in two rounds and Clubber becomes the new World Champion, and Rocky is upset when he returns to Mickey who dies in front of him. He becomes depressed with the grief and thinking that he is finished, and he has no confidence to have a re-match, but then his former opponent Apollo Creed comes along. He encourages Rocky to go for a re-match, which Clubber Lang accepts, and he starts training him, he should try to forget any rivalry he has with the thug and concentrate more on regaining his title, he needs the ""eye of the tiger"". In the end, Rocky and Clubber return to the ring to have another fight, with wife Adrian (Talia Shire) and Apollo watching in the crowd and by the ring with hope, and against all odds Rocky does win the fight with a fantastic knockout punch, once again becoming Heavyweight Champion of the World. Also starring Burt Young as Paulie, Ian Fried as Rocky Jr. and Al Silvani as Al. Stallone still gives a really likable, Weathers steps up in the ranks becoming his mentor, Shire has her moments, as does Penguin actor Meredith before his character dies, and Mr. T is a great opponent with an attitude, a great attribute that got him the part of B.A. Baracus in The A-Team. I don't think the critics are very fair about this third film in the series, the fight sequences are still gripping, the montage sequence or two with the great music is still enjoyable, and of course the Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated song ""Eye of the Tiger"" by Survivor, that went to number one, is a great song, a good boxing drama. Rocky Balboa was number 7 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, ""Yo, Adrian."" was number 80 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes. Worth watching!",Rocky III
5,ccthemovieman-1,The Ups And Downs Of Rocky & Mr. T,8,27 May 2006,"For pure entertainment, this might be the best of the five ""Rocky"" movies. I mean, where else can you see Rocky, his entourage, Mr.T. and Hulk Hogan all creating mayhem in the same movie? Hokey? Oh, man, yes indeed, but it probably has more ups and downs and memorable scenes than any in this series. Some examples:DOWN - ""Rocky Balboa"" (Sylvester Stallone) fights an exhibition match with a wild overzealous wrestling giant called ""Thunderlips"" (Hulk Hogan) and almost gets killed. UP - However, he rallies to beat the over-sized animal.DOWN - In defending his boxing title, Rocky gets pummeled by a loudmouth boxer ""Clubber Lang"" (Mr. T.). DOWN - His longtime manager ""Mickey"" (Burgess Meredith) collapses at the arena before the fight and then dies. UP - Rocky's former rival ""Apollo Creed"" agrees to train our hero in a re-match against the obnoxious villain Lang.DOWN - Down and depressed, Rocky is unable to train and be has lost his will to fight again. UP - He finds his ""eye of the tiger"" spirit and trains with great inspiration, becoming even and quicker and faster afoot than Creed!This goes on and on and on, climaxed by the fight which, of course, has another 30 of these ""ups and downs."" By the end, you're more worn out than Burgess Meredith. Mr. T, by the way, makes a great villain and the filmmakers added to the suspense using slow-motion action scenes and effective sound with all the punches, grunts and groans all add to the circus-like atmosphere. Nobody grunted like Mr. T!It's corny, it's hokey, etc., but it somehow works and certainly gives the viewer what it delivers in the ring: non-stop entertainment.",Rocky III
6,ma-cortes,"Charming and enjoyable sequel with the Italian Stallion taking on the brute Clubber Land , Mr. T",7,20 August 2017,"Acceptable follow-up in which Balboa is willing to risk his life against a violent boxer , Clubber Lang . Officially a sequel is most a rehash but happens to be a nice third chapter about Rocky saga with intimate Stallone . Interesting sequel that works every time and in which beloved Balboa is considering retirement , but he faces off a tough contender performed by Mister T (A Team) , being dethroned by the obnoxious , corpulent boxer , that's why Rocky sinks into a depression . Excessive confidence and complacency soon give rise to lose his heavyweight championship title . Two-bit fighter Rocky is now almost retired and has hit rock bottom , but he rises from ashes to fight a daring contender . About to be retired from boxing and back from riches to ring , Rocky takes on a new combat . Although he is homaged as one of the greatest boxing champions in the history also is panned as a down-and-out fighter . Then , ¨The Italian Stallion¨ , the one time champion , returns to take on the ultimate boxing combat , as he comes out from retirement for fame and self-respect to combat the strongest , youngest and faster contender . While Rocky attempts to prove himself and his family , his wife (Talia Shire), brother-in-law (Burt Young) and his veteran trainer (Burguess Meredith) . Shortly after , Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) and Duke (Tony Burton) decide to train Rocky for a rematch against the brave and invincible opponent Lang , so Rocky can attempt to win the championship back .This agreeable predictable entertainment displays splendidly the 'formula Rocky'. The movie works in usual manner , fitting appropriately to franchise , even though we know the plot the film works . This soaper on the ring is developed in gentleness , dignity , feel-good style as well as the initial outing . Great training montage and spectacular and climatic final bout . Writer-director-actor Stallone new entry is surprisingly entertaining and packs good feeling . Usual and nostalgic musical score by Bill Conti and atmospheric cinematography by Bill Butler . The motion picture was lavishly financed by the producers of complete saga , Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler and well directed by Stallone who along John G. Avildsen created the six Rocky saga.In previous and subsequent entries the contenders were the followings : ¨Rocky I¨ and ¨II¨ was Carl Weathers ; ¨Rocky III¨ the fast-mouthed and cruel boxer Mister T ; ¨Rocky IV¨ against a massive Russian boxer played by Dolph Lundgren ; ¨Rocky V¨ in which Rocky , nicknamed as the Chicken Stallion , lives from records being ostracized , but our hero returns as a coach , as Rocky goes back despite his own cerebral damage through a rematch on the streets , as he fights Tommy 'Machine' Gunn/Tommy Morrison ; meanwhile , the champ must adjust to his family's new life on bankruptcy ; subsequently ¨Rocky Balboa¨ proving his estranged young son Milo Ventiglimia who still can fight . And , finally , ¨Creed¨ in which Rocky eventually agrees to mentor Adonis , son of the known boxing champion Apollo Creed . Rating : Good , being impossible to dislike , the result is deliciously corny agreeable and predictable amusement . Although we've seen it all before , Sylvester manages to make it work one more time and it works every way even better than successive Rockys .",Rocky III
7,BA_Harrison,Ding ding!,7,4 September 2019,"Round three of the Rocky story continues to dispense with reality, Philly's famous fighter slowly becoming a parody of his former self. At the start of the movie, Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is still Heavyweight Champion, having successfully defended his title against numerous contenders, but after Mickey (Burgess Meredith) reveals that the fights have been against 'soft' opponents hand-picked to keep Rocky on top, the boxer begins to doubt himself. When Rocky finally comes up against a genuinely dangerous opponent, bruiser Clubber Lang (Mr.T), he loses his title and develops a psychological block. However, with the help of one-time rival Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), who would like nothing better than to see the arrogant Lang defeated, and with the support of his loyal wife Adrian (Talia Shire), the Italian Stallion regains the 'eye of the tiger' and rises up to the challenge of his rival. Dun... dun dun dun... dun dun dunnnnnnn....It's very silly at times and rarely feels like anything other than a formulaic Hollywood sequel, but knock me down and count to ten if I didn't have a good time. An early charity fight against Hulk Hogan (as wrestler Thunderlips) sets the tone: this is more 'comic-book' than the previous movies, the violence shrugged off by those involved (and boy, does Rocky get pummelled big time!). In Rocky's rematch against Clubber, virtually every punch hits its target and is accompanied by a bone-crunching wallop sound effect, yet both men carry on despite a clobbering that would put mere mortals like you and I in the ground, making it about as realistic as an episode of the Mr. T animated series that followed shortly after. The iconic theme song by Survivor is the icing on the cake: this is great popcorn entertainment no matter how unbelievable it all gets.",Rocky III
8,moonspinner55,Manipulation and narcissism...,2,15 March 2009,"As a director (especially one who directs himself), Sylvester Stallone shows no shame. He puts himself in front of the camera more than anybody else, sure--it's what ""Rocky"" fans want--but he's there to be pummeled and humiliated in close-up, to get his audience fighting mad. This way his revenge on the enemy will ultimately be that much more sweet. It's an old hat trick, passed down the Hollywood line, and Stallone doesn't even bother reinventing it, he just plows right ahead as if he were doing something new. Maybe he feels he's demonstrating a new form of manipulation, but it's hard to laugh it off when supporting players Talia Shire and Burt Young are used so pettily and cheaply (one big scene each). Stallone's Rocky Balboa matches jabs with Mr. T. as ""Clubber Lang"", who doesn't so much box as he does pound. This entry in the ""Rocky"" saga goes so far as to make Lang a killer. How's that for hedging your bets? *1/2 from ****",Rocky III
9,sunwarrior13,The Successful Comeback Of Rocky,8,23 October 2011,"The third Rocky film now this time goes back to becoming the ultimate sports picture of the movie franchise.After it touched on the theme as the greatest underdog movie in the first and the love story between Rocky and Adrian in the second,Rocky III touches the most about Rocky becoming a sports figure - his rise,fall and successful comeback as boxer.Rocky III is the third installment in the Rocky film series.It is written and directed by Sylvester Stallone.He again stars as title character,Rocky Balboa together with Carl Weathers as former boxing rival Apollo Creed, Burgess Meredith as Rocky's trainer Mickey, and Talia Shire as Rocky's wife, Adrian.It also stars Mr.T, who plays Rocky's opponent is James ""Clubber"" Lang,a younger and more aggressive boxer.The movie starts with the Italian Stallion so famous that his likeness is everywhere, including pinball machines. Fame and complacency soon cause Balboa to lose his title to young thug Clubber Lang,who inadvertently causes the death of Rocky's beloved trainer,Mickey before their first championship bout. After sinking into a depression,Balboa must regain the love and support of his family, as well as the elusive ""eye of the tiger,"" the hungry need to beat the opponent which former foe Apollo Creed teaches him to regain his hunger and fighting spirit in the ring.In the end, Balboa faces off against Lang for a second time. Just as I have said,Rocky III is the ultimate sports picture of the Rocky movie franchise as it centers on his being an athlete.It definitely inspires viewers especially the young people to rise from defeat and downfalls as evidenced by Balboa in this picture.Aside from refreshing themes untouched in the first two,the movie also introduces a new single ""Eye of the Tiger,"" the theme song Stallone commissioned from the band Survivor.It became a huge hit single and has also been attached to boxing matches for so many years now just like the original Rocky theme,""Gonna Fly Now"".Aside from the themes and hit single,the performances of the cast were commendable as well.Overall,the movie provides great entertainment but it falls short from being a masterpiece like the the first movie.Personally,I consider Rocky III the fourth-best in the franchise behind Rocky,Rocky Balboa and Rocky II in that order.",Rocky III

11,hitchcockthelegend,"I don't know what you want me to say. I mean, what happened? How did everything that was so good get so bad?",7,6 July 2013,"Rocky is reigning World Champion and is dispatching all comers to his crown with ease. But looming in the distance is Clubber Lang, a young and hungry boxer intent on becoming the new champ.Pretty safe enjoyment for anyone into the fantastical world of Sly Stallone's Rocky Balboa franchise. Into the narrative this time comes a new boxer, portrayed with relish by Mr. T, a revelation that cuts Rocky to the quick, and personal grief when his mentor and friend Mickey (Burgess Meredith) dies (Stallone doing brilliant believable grief). Back comes Carl Weathers as Apollo Creed, only this time he wants to train Rocky to beat the mighty Clubber Lang. Rocky's heart isn't in it though! Can he get that Eye of the Tiger back? Well of course he can and thus we get the obligatory training montages and a ferocious fight to crown the story.It's comfortable film making with comfortable acting performances and it's often very exciting as well. 7/10",Rocky III
12,utgard14,"""I pity the fool.""",6,6 July 2015,"The Rocky series stumbles a bit in this third movie. Sylvester Stallone once again writes and directs the film, in addition to starring. The plot has Rocky becoming rich, famous, and beloved as he defends the championship successfully in one bout after another. Then a hungry up-and-comer named Clubber Lang (Mr. T) publicly challenges Rocky, who accepts despite the reservations of his trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith).A good popcorn movie but the first of the series to feel like that's all it's striving to be. Mr. T is fun but hard to take seriously. Hulk Hogan has a comedy appearance as ""Thunder Lips,"" a wrestler Rocky has to fight in a charity event. This whole part is silly and kind of out of place with the rest of the movie. Nice to see most of the regulars back, including a smooth way of fitting Carl Weathers' Apollo Creed back into the story. Bill Conti's score is good but what most people remember from this one is Survivor's hit song ""Eye of the Tiger."" Not a bad movie in any way but a step down from part two.",Rocky III
13,grantss,Even more of the same - formulaic,4,12 April 2015,"Rocky is one of the most overrated movies of all time. Implausible plot, often dull and with some of the worst performances you'll see in a movie: from the over-the-top acting of Burgess Meredith to the monosyllabic, IQ-reducing grunts of Sylvester Stallone. Only Talia Shire was convincing.Only thing that made it watchable was the occasional humour, the introductory scenes and the final fight scene.Rocky II was more of the same. Human drama for 90% of the film, followed by an intense fight scene. This time, however, the human drama side is more realistic and engaging and the movie flows better for it. Still not great, as it all feels kind of predictable, but it is less dull than the first movie.Rocky III pretty much just follows the same formula. Change the guy Rocky has to fight, rinse and repeat. Only difference here is that we have two fights - one in mid-movie, one at the end.I like the idea of a serialized account of Rocky's life, but this doesn't really add anything original to the series.",Rocky III
14,Boba_Fett1138,Rocky fights Hulk Hogan and Mr. T. How could you not love this?!,10,6 June 2005,"This movie is a big improvement over the disappointing part 2 of the series. In my opinion the movie is even on par with the original.This movie quite possibly is the most entertaining one of the bunch. Even though there is some drama once more, this movie is just mainly entertaining. Main reason for this is because of the 'main villain' Clubber Lang, played by Mr. T. Oh man what a character!The boxing scene's look better than ever and the movie features quite some matches. You will just never grow tired of those spectacular filmed boxing matches!The story itself is actually also quite solid. I just love how they made Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) fit in this movie again. The drama, even though it of course all is very predictable is handled very well also once more mainly thanks to Talia Shire's acting skills. Sylvester Stallone is acting a bit disappointing in this one...but still he simply just IS Rocky.Brilliant entertainment!10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Rocky III
15,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Not pitiable... though not far off from it, either",6,26 December 2016,"Our protagonist(Sly, charmingly everyman as ever, in spite of greater fame and wealth than before) is challenged by the up-and-comer, Clubber Lang(Mr. T, his tough image not yet tempered with a fear of flying. He's fortunate assault laws clearly don't exist for those who take the ring in this). Will he return to his underdog status? Mickey's(still intense Meredith) health is failing. Might he return to the great big cold continent in the sky? And Adrian(Shire, sweet, smart and shy) is still here. They just don't know what to do with her this time. It's too bad, the love between the two is one of the elements that work best, especially for those of us who don't care about the macho crap. What? I recognize the original as amazing, and the first five were on sale. Well, they have her support him, because that's what they default her to. Paulie's(Young, still gritty) racism comes to the forefront, as Creed(Weathers, less showy) and Duke(Burton, determined) become unlikely allies.It was a matter of time before they'd cast at least one actual fighter, not an actor and/or former football player. And here we get two. Wrong sport, of course, but at least it's the right direction. A little in the fights does legitimately play out as wrestling. At the time of writing this, I've only watched up to this point in the franchise. This didn't change my mind on what I thought watching the second installment: there never shoulda been more than one movie here. And apparently I still have the worst ahead of me. Part of the point of 1 was that he couldn't possibly keep doing this, it was his last chance! The problem with a series in this genre is that we know it has to have a climactic showdown. Action flicks, thrillers, dramas... it doesn't have to be public, planned, the consequences can be purely personal. Meanwhile, here... one way or another, it needs to be set up and have emotional, not only physical, stakes. We know where it's going, and are seeing the signs. Anything that happens that isn't related to that, we know it won't prevent that from happening. You can also only go so far, intending to top what came before, without getting unrealistic: ""that wouldn't be allowed, it's against the rules"". And this does get into that territory. This runs 92 and a half minutes without credits, and 95 and a half with.There is a lot of brutal boxing and some strong language in this. I recommend it to completionists. 6/10",Rocky III
16,view_and_review,Another Quality Rocky,8,10 September 2018,"This was the only part of the Rocky series I hadn't seen. I take that back. I just checked. I haven't seen Rocky Balboa. Anyway, this was a real treat. I didn't think he could make yet another movie about boxing and still make it compelling--but he did. I think because I never took Mr. T seriously even as a kid I thought that part three was going to be a step back and part four was his rebound. Now having seen part three I'm truly impressed.Without a doubt this was the funniest of them so far but not in a farcical way. The comedy actually fit in with the movie. In this episode Rocky is nearing retirement but still in fighting shape. His newest foe, Clubber Lang (Mr. T), is a hungry, vicious, animal and he behaves like it at all times. Rocky is going to have to be innovative to defeat him and that's where Apollo Creed steps in.Even though there were more laughs in this movie it was sobering too. Rocky had to do some introspection and almost redefine himself. The dialogue throughout was good and very revealing about each character. This was another quality Rocky.",Rocky III
17,gridoon2021,Thoroughly predictable but very entertaining,6,23 September 2017,"If awards were given for entertaining surface and not artistic depth, then surely Mr.T would win many for his awesomely over-the-top performance here (""Don't turn your back on me, sucka!""). And his punches (especially in the first match) look like they have the force of one ton each. Stallone's script is thoroughly predictable and by-the-numbers, but his direction is energized and he keeps the film going at a relentless pace. In some ways, from Hulk Hogan in a redundant but fun sequence to the all-time-classic ""Eye Of The Tiger"", ""Rocky III"" is one of the quintessential 1980s films. And the slow-motion bouncing and hugging at the beach between Stallone and Weathers belongs in the annals of camp! **1/2 out of 4.",Rocky III
18,Uriah43,My Favorite Rocky Movie,7,7 January 2016,"After defeating ""Apollo Creed"" (Carl Weathers) in another epic bout, ""Rocky Balboa"" (Sylvester Stallone) now turns his attention to defending his world heavyweight title by defeating 10 different challengers over the course of 3 years. However, there is one challenger his manager ""Micky Goldmill"" (Burgess Meredith) has not scheduled and his name is ""Clubber Lang"" (Mr. T) who has advanced through the rankings and has now become the #1 challenger. Yet even though Rocky wants to postpone his retirement and fight Clubber Lang, Mickey still wants nothing to do with it because he has seen just how powerful Clubber Lang is and doesn't think fighting him is in Rocky's best interest. But Rocky persists and Mickey reluctantly agrees. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that--even though it may not be the best in the series--it is my favorite of the bunch. Admittedly, it's not as deep as ""Rocky"" or even possibly ""Rocky II"". But it has more action and excitement. Likewise, despite the fact that Mr. T was nominated for a ""Razzie Award"" for his performance, I thought he performed rather well given his particular role. Additionally, I thought Carl Weathers did a fine job as well. In any case, while it may not have been up to the same standard as ""Rocky"", I thought it was still quite enjoyable and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",Rocky III

21,Aaron1375,"Oddly enough, my favorite Rocky movie.",8,7 March 2009,"This Rocky movie is a rather quick flowing film compared to the first movies and features a bit more comedy while still having drama and inspirational scenes that were pivotal in the first two movies. The fights are different here too, as in this film we do not have the 15 round beat downs of the first films, but rather three rounds of pure hard hitting. In this one we start out with a strange charity match as Rocky the heavyweight champion of boxing goes against the heavyweight champion of wrestling, Thunderlipps (Hulk Hogan in his only decent appearance in a movie, then again it is not really a stretch). This match is rather entertaining and funny, but soon Rocky must face a new challenger to his belt, the very tough Clubber Lang played by a very tough Mr. T. Mickey does not want Rocky to fight this guy as Mickey has seen that Rocky has lost the fire in his eyes that got him the title and would most likely lose to this determined if a bit arrogant new fighter. Well they do end up fighting and Rocky loses and gets hit even worse by the passing of his mentor. Apollo having witnessed the fight and not liking Clubber Lang at all offers to help Rocky train and thus a new friendship is born. The training is nice to watch and I like how Rocky does different strategies against Clubber in the final fight. Sure this movie is a bit more over the top than the previous Rocky movies, it to me is still my favorite.",Rocky III
22,mm-39,Awesome,8,1 May 2001,"Spoilers   Stallone writes a great script, with an excellent cast.  It is about hunger, determination, and eye of the tiger.  The film portrays Mr T as a hungry new fighter with intensity who challenges the champion, and Rocky has to over come the challenges of staying on top.  Hulk Hogan is in this film, and adds great comic relief to the boxer wrestler scenario. Great script, with Rock blaming himself for Mickeys death, and you feel his pain when Mickey dies, and Carl Weather's comes into the picture as Rocky's mentor for a favor.  This is movie if you watch it feeling low, it will motivate you.",Rocky III
23,Smells_Like_Cheese,Makes you want to go the distance and hit someone :D,7,28 November 2005,"You know, a few months ago, I felt that it's kinda silly for me to claim to be a movie fan yet not see the Rocky movies and my friend even told me that it's a must see to be an official movie fanatic. So, I had decided to see all the Rocky flicks, and low and behold there is a 6th one coming out next year, so what better time? I felt that people are a little harsh on ""Rocky III"". Yeah, it's lost a little more edge and originality, but I felt that they kept it cool and within it's origins. Come on, I mean it's the eye of the tiger! Mr. T, he's so cool. He's so bad and you want to hate him, but you can't because he's just so cool. I loved the twist of having Apollo help Rocky train to defeat Mr. T. What more could a Rocky fan want out of this film? It's going strong and I can't wait to watch the fourth one. I know what happens unfortunately, I watch those ""I love the 80's"" shows. :P But I'm still excited, I love these Rocky movies. I may just see Rocky X! Come on, fans, this doesn't deserve a 5.6, let's get that rating up! 7/10",Rocky III
24,MovieAddict2016,"Surprisingly good addition to the ""Rocky"" series...",8,22 January 2004,"""No, I don't hate Balboa. I pity the fool.""Mr. TWho would have ever thought that, after a sequel to a movie that needed none, the ""Rocky"" chronicles could remain so interesting? Yes, a lot of people make fun of these movies, but I've always thought that the ""Rocky"" sequels were a lot better than they could have been -- especially considering the fact that the first film is arguably one of the greatest ever made, and definitely not the type of film that should have merited four sequels. How many times can we see Rocky re-train and win a battle? It's always the same. Yet somehow ""Rocky III"" comes across as a fresh one-two punch. Extremely easy to watch and fun to get into, this is a retread of the first and second film. But, as I said, somehow everything seems fresh.Arguably the final ""good"" film in the series (although I still consider the last two passable), this chapter sees the death of Mickey (Burgess Meredith), a fierce opponent (Mr. T) ready to take on Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), an angry Paulie (Burt Young), an eager-to-train Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), and an insane 7-foot boxer (Hulk Hogan).
After defeating Apollo Creed at the end of Part II, Rocky is challenged and defeated in the ring by Clubber Lang (Mr. T). Things continue to go wrong when his boxing trainer dies, and Rocky drifts into a state of self loathing and hatred. After the city of Philadelphia presents him with a statue of himself, he drives over to it with his motorcycle and throws his helmet at it.Rocky blames himself for Mickey's death, and nearly turns down Apollo's offer to train Rocky so that he can enter the ring one more time and give a real beating to Clubber Lang. But alas, he decides to enter into the ring one last time, and so with the help of Apollo and his wife (Talia Shire), he trains harder and longer than he ever has before.That is all there is, in short. In between we get corny dialogue like, ""You've gotta get back the Eye of the Tiger, man!"" while the song plays in the background as we see Rocky and Apollo running on the beach in short-shorts and lifting weights together and boxing and doing jump ropes. (These things may be interpreted as homosexual nowadays, by the way.)
Having boxed a bit myself, the ""Rocky"" series always seems pretty close to reality. I've never been in a ring like ""real"" boxers, but I've done the same training with boxing bags and running and jump ropes and so on. It's hard work, just like it is in the movie. And this is the perfect film to give you the inspiration to work out. Strange, right? Don't ever, ever quote me on that last paragraph. In fact, just forget the entire thing.The film, written and directed by Stallone, is surprisingly sweet and endearing. We still care for Rocky after three films -- and hey, as old as the training scenes may get, I still love them. This movie isn't as good as the first ""Rocky,"" or maybe even the second, but I still say that this series has a long way to go before it reaches the murky depths of ""Police Academy.""And take some advice from Stallone: ""Boy, sometimes charity really hurts!"" Oh, wait, never mind. Wrong quote. How about this? ""Nothing is real if you don't believe in who you are!"" Okay, it's not the next ""Citizen Kane."" But you'll be hard-pressed to find a more entertaining second sequel than this.3.5/5 stars.John Ulmer",Rocky III
25,disdressed12,2nd sequel in Rocky series,7,2 February 2007,"Rocky 3 is not a bad movie,as far as the series goes.it has lots of action,some good training sequences and some dramatic moments.however it lacks something that the first 2 have.and that is heart.it just doesn't have the depth of that they have.this is not a tangible thing,but more a feeling.if you watch Rocky 3,you will understand.the antagonist,(villain)Clubber Lang,Rocky's rival,is fairly strong as portrayed by Mr.T.though i get the sense this movie was made just to keep the franchise going.I say this because if you watch the next installment,Rocky 4,you will notice there is more intent to the whole movie.The antagonist is much more developed and there is more at stake.there are actually 2 antagonists and you will understand if you watch the movie.anyway, back to 3.the filmmakers could have done without this installment and went right to 4.as for Rocky 3-- 7 stars/10",Rocky III
26,KineticSeoul,Eye Of The Tiger,7,6 February 2016,"It doesn't have the depth and heart that the first one did. But it's still a alright sequel in the franchise, not great but it's a alright watch. So Rocky is back, the boxer with the heart of gold is back again. He may not be the brightest boxer, but he has heart and he has the eye of the tiger. So it's basically a movie with a boxer with a heart of gold, but lacks much emotional depth and heart compared to the first one. But than again it's really difficult to top the first ""Rocky"" film. The film is about Rocky's passion in the boxing game, his relationship with Rocky's coach Mickey (who is sort of a plot device in this). And his relationship with Apollo Creed, who becomes his new coach. That teaches Rocky to become a more confident, hungry, flexible and rhythmic fighter. To go against one of the most iconic Rocky opponent in the franchise Clubber Lang. Clubber Lang is such a stereotypical opposing boxer who seems to be a utter jerk just for the sake of being a jerk. It also has a returning character that probably no one wanted, Paulie. If Rocky Balboa is a man of heart and integrity, Paulie is the opposite. Overall this is a good fast-paced installment in the ""Rocky"" franchise that is worth a watch. It does seem sort of commercial at times, with Hulk Hogan making a cameo appearance.7.3/10",Rocky III
27,OllieSuave-007,Remembered rooting for ol' Rocky.,8,12 March 2014,"Part III of the Rocky saga has Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) holding the title as the heavyweight champion until he is defeated by challenger Clubby Lang (Mr. T). To regain his fighting spirit for a rematch, Rocky is trained by his old nemesis, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers).This is one of those movies I saw once when I was a little kid. While I don't remember much of it, I do recall rooting for Rocky in the boxing matches and do remember it as being of the more exciting movies to watch back in the 1980s. The boxing matches are well-choreographed and Sylvester Stallone is creative in his Rocky role. Mr. T is perfect as Clubber Lang and a great opponent/villain for Rocky. You put the two in the ring it is like the fight of the century. Overall, it's a nice piece of sport drama movie.Grade B",Rocky III
28,sddavis63,A Civilized Rocky Meets Mr. T,7,27 December 2001,"A lot of people didn't care very much for this movie, but personally I rather liked it. It isn't without its weaknesses, but I thought overall that it was better than Rocky II, and certainly worth watching, if one likes the ""Rocky"" series.Sylvester Stallone plays a much more civilized Rocky Balboa in this picture. Rocky has been champion for three years and has had ten title defences - unfortunately, as we discover from Manager Mickey (again played well by Burgess Meredith), against ""hand-picked opponents."" ""Good fighters,"" Mickey insists, but fighters he knew Rocky could beat. ""My job was to keep you winning, and to keep you healthy,"" he explained to Rocky by way of justification. But a new, hard, lean and mean fighter (""Clubber Lang,"" played perfectly by Mr.T) has appeared as the top contender, and Mickey wants nothing to do with him. Rocky has become soft, and not up to the challenge. He lives in a big mansion, fights wrestlers (""Thunderlips,"" played by Hulk Hogan, in what I thought was a very amusing performance) for charity, and even speaks in a more cultured voice. But Rocky accepts the challenge from Clubber, and the movie goes from there.Clubber Lang is a very different opponent for Rocky than Apollo Creed ever was. I just couldn't dislike Creed. I rooted for Rocky, of course, in those fights, but Creed was not unlikable. He was a showman, and even when a nastier side of him appeared in ""Rocky II,"" it was understandable. I felt sympathy for him. But Clubber is just thoroughly mean and unlikable. An opponent like Clubber was probably necessary to make this movie worthwhile. Carl Weathers was decent as Apollo Creed, who now accepts the responsibility for getting Rocky ready for Clubber. Aside from that, though, the performances were a bit lacking. Not because of bad acting, but because the movie was very short (just over an hour and a half) and a lot of it was taken up with training shots. Talia Shire was for me an exception to this, though. I thought her performance as Adrian was very good, especially a powerful scene on the beach when she convinces Rocky that he has to do this just for himself, and not for anyone else.There were weaknesses here. The dialogue (never particularly a strong suit in the ""Rocky"" franchise) left much to be desired, and a piece of atrocious over-acting by Sylvester Stallone at Mickey's death scene left me laughing rather than crying, but I liked this movie. And, as always, the fight scenes were magnificent.7/10.",Rocky III
29,sol1218,The eye of the tiger the thrill of the fight,7,6 July 2013,"***SPOILERS**** After Rocky Balboa's winning the World Heavyweight Championship in his re-match drag out and knock down battle with ""the Master of Disater"" Apollo Creed, Carl Weathers, he's given a hand picked string of second tier boxers by his concerned, in not having his fighter and meal ticket Rocky hurt, trainer/manager the Willy Mickey Goldmill, Burgess Meredith, to defend his hard won tidal against. In the background there's the hard hitting training and determined 230 pounds of fighting fury Clubber Lang, Mister T, mowing his way through the heavyweight ranks, like Iron Mike Tyson did before he got his title match, nipping like an out of control pit bull terrier at Rocky's feet.It's at an unavailing ceremony of the Rocky Balboa statue in downtown Philadelphia that Lang finally got his chance to meet face to face with Rocky not only taunting him about how scared he is of him and not willing to give him a shot at the heavyweight title. The mad and intimidating Lange really lets Rocky have it by even going so far as insulting his manhood by claiming that he, unlike Rocky, could satisfied his wife Yo Adrian, Talia Shire, both in and out of bed more then he ever could!With Rocky at first planing to retire from boxing he puts his retirement on hold to give the big bad as well as big mouth Lang a title shot against the better judgment off his manager Mickey. And as history or the film proved it turned out to be a major disaster for Rocky Balboa. He gets clobbered by Lang in two round leaving him both defeated as well as punch drunk. It was also not long after the match with Lang that his friend and manager Mickey who was knocked cold by a crazed and uncontrollable Lang before the fight with Rocky suddenly passed away!Now down in the dumps and the laughing stock of all the entire sports world especially after his wild and bizarre charity match with professional wrestler the 7 foot tall 350 pounds Thunderlips, Hulk Hogan, who's billed as ""Every Womens Dream"" Rocky goes into a deep depression. In him feeling that his entire boxing career that he was so proud of was nothing but a joke. It's non other then his former bitter opponent Apollo Creed who comes to Rocky's rescue when nobody else even his wife Yo Adrian and struggling to stay sober friend and brother in law Paulie, Burt Young, could. With Apollo taking Rocky under his wings and putting him through a vigorous and ghetto like, in a Watts L.A boxing gym, training regiment he got Rocky in the best shape of his life to take on Lang in a re-match where he wasn't taken seriously at all by Lang or the boxing and sport world.****SPOILERS**** probably the best and shortest,three rounds, fight sequence up to then far better the the previous two Rocky movies with the title fight taken place at New York's Madison Square Garden has Rocky charge out of his corner at the opening bell and box instead of slug it out, like he did in their first match, with Clubber Lang easily taking, on all cards , the first round. In the second round Lang got over his confusion and started to punch his way through Rocky's defenses with Lang's devastating punches getting to Rocky flooring him a number of times. It's then when it looked like curtains for Rocky that he went on the defensive letting Lang do all the swinging until by the middle of the third round his devastating punches, that can poke holes through a brick wall, were nothing more but harmless cream puffs. It was Lang not Rocky who ended up defeating himself by punching himself out so badly that by the time Rocky opened up on him with his left hooks and straight rights that he was left punchy and rubbed armed as well as flat on his back and on the mat for a ten count. With Lang so exhausted and punched out even a light tap from Rocky's old lady Yo Adrian would have done the job as well.P.S Now with his title back Rocky has one favor to do for his friend Apollo who gave him back that hungry mean and lean ""Eye of the Tiger"" attitude that he needed to defeat Lang. And in an empty gym's boxing ring, probably the famous Gleason's Gym in the Dumbo section of Brooklyn, the two square off in their unannounced rubber match to see who's the best. And as Rocky & Apollo are about to let loose with straight rights and left hooks the screen freezes leaving it up to us in the audience to imagine just what the ultimate and final results of that bout would be!",Rocky III
30,FeastMode,my notes,7,26 June 2019,"I think this is the best one yet. A step up from the previous two. better story, more creative, better directing. the only thing I think it lacked compared to the first two was the dumb but funny stuff Rocky always says, and his general goofiness. but that was all part of the story as he is now more civilized.

31,Robert_duder,An important but yet sub standard edition to the series,7,9 January 2007,"Rocky III is probably one of the most well known, liked, rooted for, and important entries in the series. Important because it was Rocky's first move into main stream film leaving behind it's more critically acclaimed roots. In a way Rocky III began to start the film's procession in the same direction as Balboa's career. In Rocky III Rocky has become enamored with the life of fame and fortune. He puts aside his training to show himself off to the people, and ""trades his passion for glory"" as the famous theme song says. Rocky III featured not one but three fights and also featured big time wrestler Hulk Hogan and eighties icon Mr. T. as Rocky's adversaries. Now none of this is to say that Rocky III isn't good, I only mean to say that Rocky III falls from grace as far as the greatness of the original and it's sequel. However the third installment has some great moments that are integral to the series including the death of Rocky's mentor and trainer Mickey, in a very moving scene, and the friendship that grows between Rocky and former adversary Apollo Creed, who now trains Rocky. As a kid I always remembered Rocky III being my favorite but now seeing it years later it just doesn't have the depth and intelligence and intense story as some of the other ones.Sylvester Stallone once again helms the project as director, writer and star. I just felt that in this film Stallone lost his touch with Balboa and the character doesn't have the same feel but perhaps that is the idea? Either way Stallone is still watchable as the ultimate underdog because for the first time we see him as the champion dealing with his celebrity status and raising his son and being a husband and friend. He still manages to touch the heart strings for his powerful scene following Mickey's death. Burgess Meredith returns as Mickey in a very good performance. Mickey is obviously dying but Rocky is almost too busy with his fame to notice. His death is life shattering for Rocky and Meredith is a sad loss to the series but his scenes are powerful. Talia Shire returns as Rocky's wife Adrian. Her performance is toned down significantly in this film which is part of where the charm goes. Rocky has always been a powerful love story and Adrian's toned down part makes a big difference. Burt Young also returns as the incomparable Paulie who still gets that laughs with his rough around the edges performance is still the same old Paulie. He hardly ever changes and for the character and Young that's a good thing. Carl Weathers returns as Apollo Creed but this time as trainer rather than opponent desperate to help Rocky regain his title after Mr. T. destroys him. Weathers is even better as a friend to Rocky because he loses none of Creed's charm and flamboyance becoming trainer. Mr. T. is well...he's Mr. T....I mean the guy doesn't change much and his performance as Clubber Lang certainly did become a film classic. His steely look and brute force and build makes him a worthy opponent but even still I never thought he had the same talent as Balboa despite beating him once. Hulk Hogan makes a humorous appearance as ""Thunderlips"" a pro-wrestler who agrees to take on Rocky for charity and gives a funny, and rather overblown performance.No matter what I say about Rocky III you must see it. It's an absolute eighties classic and it's an essential part of the Rocky series which everyone must see hands down. It has it's pluses and a few minuses being a little commercially forced but it also had some very important moments to the entire series. It just didn't quite have the heart as some of the other installments but for one of a series of 6 that is allowed and it still meets my approval. 7.5/10",Rocky III
32,ElMaruecan82,The most difficult fight is against our inner demons ...,7,29 November 2011,"In ""Rocky III"", we're so far from the atmosphere of the previous films that the result could have been disastrous if it wasn't (again) for the characters and their genuine appeal. They're all here, Rocky, Adrian, Paulie, Mickey and Apollo, the fantastic five embarked for the last time together for one of the most defining film of the flamboyant 80's, the third opus of the ""Rocky"" series.On the surface, Stallone really took the distance from the first two films, featuring a Rocky Balboa at the pinnacle of his boxing career, the undefeated Heavy Weight Champion of the World. The Italian Stallion's success even mirrors Sly's iconic status in the 80's: the movie begins with a clever montage featuring Sly himself after the first ""Rocky"" launched his career, it's a whole different mood, forget the austere Philadelphian streets and say hello to the 80's with its lot of action, glitter and cringe-worthy over-the-top moments (gay ballade on the beach, the infamous boxing/wrestling gala fight etc.) and of course, the hit-song that plays as a fitting subtitle: ""Eye of the Tiger"". Say anything about Stallone and his ""Rocky"" series, but no one can deny that the guy named Sly knew how to create an impact.The first booming notes of ""Eye the Tiger"" resonate as a hymn for passion, hunger for fight, and thirst for victory, the 70's are over when the world needed an underdog hero going the distance, no place for the small players, it's all about winning and fighting and defeating, while Stallone created another cinematic icon that defined the 80's through John Rambo. ""Rocky III"" had to stand out for some values that are less appealing now, and this is why the first opus is still the one that stood the test of time. Still, the catchy Oscar-nominated 'Tiger' song injects some pep in our veins and makes ""Rocky III"" the solid conclusion of a great trilogy. And that's why we notice the flaws of ""Rocky IV"" more than in ""Rocky III"", it didn't have ""The Eye of the Tiger"", much more than a song, a concept as powerful and defining as Dirty Harry's 'Make my day' quote in the Reagan era.Now, should I really enumerate the flaws of ""Rocky III""? As for ""Part II"", does it really matter? I guess yes since a review asks for a minimum of objectivity, I have to mention that again, the movie sins by a predictable script whose structure parallels the second film's plot, who would have bet on Rocky after watching the first training montage? Anyway, it went like this, first act : Rocky is good, second act : he's down, third act: he's back, with all the cheers and applauds  and despite all the obviousness, it works. The ""Rocky"" sequels illustrate the idea that the greatness of a film can rely on its 'wowing' conclusion. On that basis, ""Rocky III"" is a winner, not a Heavy Weight champion like ""Rocky"" but still, a film that works, and unlike ""Rocky II"", it doesn't work less thanks to Rocky Balboa, than to all the other supporting characters around him. For once, Rocky is central to the plot but not to the appreciation of the film. You can tell that Mr. T, Burgess Meredith, Carl Weathers and even Talia Shire steal the show.The most memorable aspect of the film is the antagonism and how a good replacement Clubber Lang is to Apollo Creed. Mr. T is like a mean-spirited but more determined version of Apollo, and despite what he said, I'm sure he just didn't pity but probably hated the fool he thought Balboa was. There's an interesting contrast set between Lang and Rocky. Lang is closer to Rocky's roots while Rocky became too smart, well-dressed and self-confident, it might discomfort some viewers in his first scene with Paulie but I guess it helps to build the new personality of Rocky, something that will be echoed in a poignant discussion with Mickey, who informs Rocky that he got civilized, in other words, he doesn't have the muscle anymore to fight killers like Lang. Psychoanalytically speaking, Clubber is what Rocky lacks. Logically, Rocky loses his match against Clubber and when it couldn't have been any worse, he loses even more.The movie takes an emotional way, which is what the ""Rocky"" series have done best and after the tear-jerking farewell to Mickey, the grumpiest and most lovable sports coach, Rocky face a serious existential crisis. This is where Apollo makes his entrance, and closes the story's arc of his relationship with Rocky. As I said in my review of the first film, ""Rocky"" has always been about relationships and interactions, this is what makes the movies work, despite their flaws. And in the third opus, it's an extraordinary idea to allow the defeated Apollo to take a share from Rocky's victory, reminding us that Apollo's last defeat was a very close call and the Rock still have something to learn, to take his pride back. But it ain't easy fighting his own demons and this is when the shy good wife Adrian let Rocky open his heart, admit his own fears and set his mind up to challenge Clubber Lang again. The eye of the tiger is a burning flame that got ignited in the heart.So it's easy to criticize ""Rocky III"" and mock the evolution of the characters, but the movie is still a good cinematic achievement, more entertaining and heart-warming than your average sports films, it works because the first two films built a gallery of unforgettable characters, we learned to know, to appreciate and to love, as if unconsciously, we never wanted the series to end",Rocky III

Nevertheless, Mr. T does a fantastic job of making you hate his character, so the stakes seem high. It's also nice to see Rocky & Apollo's relationship progress and Adrian's character growth.

The answer is - Obviously longer than common sense allows. The movie was blockbuster, it launched the song ""Eye of the Tiger"" in unbelievable heights, and it achieved crazy success in every way. However crazy it may sound, rearranging of the Rocky story works and it works well. The story is good, acting and directing too, the soundtrack kicks ass, and the movie keeps attention from the first till the very last moment, and it really leaves a strong impression.

38,ironhorse_iv,I pity the fool that hasn't saw Rocky 3 yet. It's a knock-out punch!,7,6 January 2015,"Let's rock! It's time, once again to enter the square circle, and see what happen to Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), the underdog as he faced his greatest foe, yet in Clubber Lang (Mr. T). My predictions. Pain. Directed and written by Sylvester Stallone, the movie starts off from the events of 1979's Rocky II, as Rocky Balboa reigns as a World Heavyweight Champion prizefighter. He's on the verge of retiring undefeated when he's taunted by a contender, Clubber Lang. When, Rocky learn that his longtime trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) has been lining up easy opponents all along, because Mickey believe the wealthy & comfortable lifestyle has made Rocky gone soft. Rocky must once again, find the eye of the tiger to defeat a man like Lang. If the first two movies were based off the Muhammad Ali and Chuck Wepner, then this film fight remind me of what would happen if Rocky Marciano step on the ring with a Mike Tyson type of a fighter. Since, Tyson was still an unknown boxer at the time. I believe Clubber Lang was based on a combo of Sonny Liston, George Foreman, and Larry Holmes. He's a one-dimensional bully with no back story or redeeming features. It made him a great antagonist. Still, I was really hoping for more from the character than being menacing. I glad, this film made Mr. T into a celebrity, but it hard to take him, seriously as a threat to Rocky when rewatching this film, due to the star going on to be a kids' action hero on TV's The A-Team and even his own Saturday-morning TV cartoon, after this. Mr. T became more and more of a joke as the 1980s went on. It's clear that the character of Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) was influenced by outspoken boxer Muhammad Ali. You really do see it in Carl Weathers performance here who takes a more supporting role here by helping Rocky trained against Lang. Creed is humanized so well in this film. Supporting returning characters such as Adrian (Talia Shire) & Paulie (Burt Young) also make the film, worthwhile. Adrian is just as beautiful as she was in the first film. Is Paulie, a bit racist in the film? Yes, but it's pretty tame. I like to think, Paulie somewhere in the film, learn to respect black people, but I doubt it, but he's not the main focus on the film. His presence in the film is pretty minor. Sylvester Stallone is once again, great as the main role, Rocky Balboa. Even as view as the top man in his sport, he still the underdog when it comes to challenges. This movie shows what it is like to have everything rather than to start out with nothing like the previous movies. It show, how fame can lost a person, and for you to gather yourself up, you have to start from scratch. The movie has a lot of heart. Without spoiling it, you feel for Rocky, for the person, he lose in the film. You want to see him, bounce back from that lost. You really want him to go the distance even if Rocky is super rich, now. In my opinion, Rocky Balboa is the greatest character, Sylvester Stallone ever played. It doesn't matter, if he's rich, poor, or old, his 'go for it' motto for life is a great role model and Stallone acting shows that. This movie also have some of the best training montage to pump up. This will inspire anybody for anything. You really get what Rocky is going through. The music is once again, uplifting as hell. Not only do you got, the original Rocky theme song, 'Gonna Fly Now' by Bill Conti with lyrics by Carol Connors and Ayn Robbins. The Rocky series got 'Eye of the Tiger' by the band, Survivor. The film nearly got the song ""You're the Best"" performed by Joe Esposito. That song was later used for 1984's film, 'the Karate Kid'. It's seem like a nearly perfect film, but this film however, depending on who looks at it, might dislike it for the more cartoony action than realistic drama, approach. Rocky and Clubber Lang take a pounding in their fight scenes, but it look less like boxing and more like pro-wrestling. Rocky getting tossed around by a cameo from a wrestler, Hulk Hogan was interesting. Indeed, this movie helped bring pro wrestling into the mainstream, 3 years later when the film co-stars, Mr. T & Hulk Hogan would team up to fight Roddy Piper & Paul Orndorff at Wrestlemania in 1985. That event was a success, and help bring new light to this film. Because of that wrestling event, Rocky IV was greenlight & release later that year. Would this movie have been a box-office hit if Rocky's opponents were better-drawn character instead of just a trash-talking cartoon like bullies? It's hard to tell. Its cheese factor is one of its biggest draws for me. Is the movie, a bit dated? Yes, the awful 1980s fashion trends are throughout the film, but it's a product of the times. Is the writing is sub per? No, I think Stallone deserve more credit for making Rocky into a likable boxer. He could be a little more, clever in some parts. Does the movie glorifies a brutal violent blood-sport? Yes, but for a movie about boxing, it's pretty tame. Not a lot of blood in this film. The camera work in the film are pretty damn good. The movie was beautiful shot, and the movie ends with one of the most iconic way, a film should end: with a Leroy Neiman painting. Overall: It was indeed a change of direction for the Rocky series, but without a doubt, it's one of the better films of the series. Plus, it gave us the Rocky statue in Philly. So- It has to be must-watch. It's an excellent story of a true underdog getting back on top.",Rocky III

40,slightlymad22,A Change of Direction For Rocky,9,4 January 2007,"Continuing my plan to watch every Sly Stallone movie in order, I come to the second sequel to the Oscar winning ' Rocky', Rocky 3. After the success of Rocky 2, Sly tanked at the box office (unfairly in this reviewers opinion, as both are solid entertainment) with Nighthawks and Escape To Victory. So Sly returned to Rocky once more Plot In A Paragraph: Rocky (Stallone) is champion of the world, has 10 title defences under his belt, has untold fame and fortune and is given his own statue. When suddenly a new challenger arrives, the vicious Clubber Lang (Mr.T) who Mickey (Burgess Meredith) is keen for Rocky to avoid. For a series as long running as the Rocky movies, it's only natural for there to be the occasional need for a breath of fresh air - a fresh perspective on a tried and tested formula. After the last movie relied heavily on the first movie, a fresh rethink was called for by creator/writer, director and star Stallone despite the previous film's box office success. After meddling with scripts and the movies editing on his last two pictures Stallone is back in full creative control. And it's to the movies benefit. Stallone is at his best when playing Rocky--it is his vision and his creation--and despite what Hollywood wants us to think, he is not a bad director either.From the supercharged ""Eye of the Tiger"" opening this film just does not let up. All of the cast are great, none more so than Stallone himself. The scene of Mickey's death after Rocky's destruction at the hands of Clubber Lang is brilliant-But the Masterstroke here lies in making Apollo a far more central character after Mickey's death. all of this and I still haven't even mentioned CLUBBER! Mr .T is perfect as Clubber Lang a great adversary for Rocky and the power and intensity his character displays in the ring is ferocious. I still say Mike Tyson stole Clubber Lnag's act!!The second fight between Rocky and Clubber is just breathtaking, the pace of the fight is electric, some of the camera work makes you feel like you are literally in the ring with these two warriors.This movie is a must for anyone with the slightest interest in being entertained!!",Rocky III
41,zkonedog,Rocky Goes Hollywood...And Loses Himself,6,11 March 2017,"After conquering Apollo Creed and winning the title in the previous film, in this installment Rocky Balboa must face his toughest opponent yet...himself.For a basic plot summary, ""Rocky III"" continues the inspiring story of pugilist Balboa (Sylvester Stallone). After defending his title numerous times against hand-picked opponents, Rocky seems to have lost that ""eye of the tiger"" he had in the two Creed fights. At the same time, #1 contender Clubber Lang (Mr. T) is hungry for a shot at the strap (training vigorously while Rocky films commercials). This causes dissension in the Balboa ranks, with trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) and wife Adrian (Talia Shire) trying to protect Rocky for different reasons.The redeeming portion of this screenplay is the continued character growth of Rocky. For whatever reason (as Sly Stallone had proved himself completely incompetent as a director up to that point), Sly just ""gets"" Rocky and knows how to smartly advance the character.The problem is that whereas the first two Rocky films use the fight scenes to cap off the drama, this time the drama is few and far between due to the bloated ring time. Nearly half the movie is spent ""in the ring"", and considering the fakey fight scenes, that is not a good thing. Likely because Rocky II was roundly criticized for being too slow to develop, this time the action is fast and furious, though not to the benefit of the overall experience.Another thing that hurts this series is the terrible casting decisions that is Mr. T. He turns in easily the worst performance of the entire six-film series, and this includes a movie starring Dolph Lundgren. He has no sense of choreography in the boxing scenes, and only issues a series of grunts in the acting department.Thus, while ""Rocky III"" does enough things right to be watchable, it also does enough tings wrong for me to consider it the worst of the entire franchise.",Rocky III
42,poe426,Rocco goes down hard...,6,8 August 2014,"Suffering from what's come to be known as ""boxing dementia,"" our hero Rocco (like filmmaker Stallone himself) coasts along, milking his name for all it's worth. Everything's fine until a menacing challenger appears on the horizon- ""Mr. T,"" as Clubber Lang (an Ernie Shavers type of puncher; hence, the moniker ""Clubber""). Clubber threatens the franchise, ridiculing Rocco's mixed martial arts bout with the infamous Thunderlips (""Hulk"" Hogan). When he runs out of places to hide, Rocco gives in and takes his medicine. You can't take that many shots to the head and walk away unaffected; it's fantasy to think so. Just look at what happened to fighters like Jerry Quarry. (Many of the greatest fights ever fought can be found on YouTube, but almost NONE of them can be found on DVD. Maybe Stallone could help some of the real life fighters who fought the fights by starting a line of high-quality dvds showcasing them and donating some of the proceeds to their retirements.) I just recently revisited this one (hence, the updated comments) and I realized that it's not as bad as I'd originally remembered it being- it's WORSE. This is a comic book made for the Big Screen- and not in a good sense: it's chock full of the kind of know-nothing s--- one finds in television shows (ESPECIALLY those that purport to be ""boxing"" stories). Originally, I thought that Stallone had asked Carl Weathers (as Apollo Creed) to teach him to ""fight like a black man"" in the movie. I was mistaken. Wherever I heard that statement, it wasn't in ROCKY III- but it STILL stands as one of the dumbest things I've ever heard.",Rocky III
43,johnnyboyz,"Stallone keeps things chugging along in this sequel, a film building on what was good about its prior entries whilst allowing for fresh avenues.",6,4 April 2012,"Something rather amusing happens around about the midway point in 1982's Rocky III, a moment wherein it snaps out of a proverbial daze and realises it is, in fact, betraying its 1976 original's core politic. Ah yes, the original: that film about the underdog being able to pull through and achieve precisely what it is they want even though all seems lost and one is on a road to nowhere. The moment I'm referring to in Rocky III is, of course, when it realises it needs its eponymous and ever-present lead, Rocky Balboa, to go back to not being the the favourite for a huge fight with a hulking African American individual of supreme ability – thus, it plunges them back down the pecking order and into a situation wherein they must strive and train to get (back) to the top. It is a curious thing to see a sports movie as generic as this one begin with its protagonist at the top of his game and seemingly indomitable, but credit to director Sylvester Stallone and the team for worming their way around some tight rapids and down into a stream of engaging formulae that does not grate.When it begins, it begins with Balboa on the top of the world as the champ. Balboa has trumped all, often flooring them in the process, in a flurry of mean boxing ring set punch-'em-ups inducing a rise in ranking about as meteoric as how opposing boxers have tumbled. Rocky has his name and face up in lights: it is on the television and all over merchandise stretching to that of pinball machines. He is a superstar: he is Rocky Balboa, and yet at once he is Sylvestor Stallone – both men have been catapulted to stardom after 1976's initial outing and both are living this high life of close knit bonds; idolisation and fame. When we observe what appears to be Balboa guesting on The Muppets Show, and having a gentle box with a punching bag, it is in actual fact footage of Stallone on an actual television broadcast made possible through his acting and writing of the original film, while the use of fleeting moments from the aforementioned film winning plaudits at the Academy Awards is symptomatic of these blurred lines between audience's own awareness of Stallone's own off screen exploits and Balboa's fictitious achievements.Two of these matches have been, no less, that of fellow boxing champion Apollo Creed, whose own story in the second film was as interesting as Rocky's was in the first film and whose ego in the first synced up with how fantastic Rocky thought he was in the second. The portrayals sort of even themselves out, I guess, and in III, they're actually on pretty good terms with room for something more in the form of a mentoring relationship. A man has an eye on Balboa during these moments of fame and he is Clubber Lang (Mr. T), a man who stares on discouragingly from the sides at Rocky being lauded come the end of another victory as all others in the auditorium cheer. Lang makes for a meaner, cruder and more imbalanced substitute for Creed; a tough talking African American who has a habit of winning and sees himself as invincible. For the most part, Lang is the underdog but he is unpleasant and spits these tirades of self congratulatory euphemisms on top of derogatory remarks aimed at our lead – at least when Rocky came to hear or speak of Creed in 1976's first film, it was a little more along the lines of common courtesy and respect. Indeed, when Lang sees fit to go so far as to systematically insult the man's wife and masculinity, the film has placed us firmly within the camp of this time gunning for the incumbent champ over the sprightly newcomer, something which goes against the franchise-to-this-point's politic and something which is actually muscled into being inverted following an initial bout.As was with Rocky II, one feels you'd have to be in a fairly bad mood to come away not having enjoyed it. No doubt there are arguments that it is overly derivative, while there cannot be much denying that it is a tad simplistic at times. A charity match with a wrestler, two sports-persons top of their respective contact sporting worlds, eats up time and is a bit of a boorish sequence designed to induce cheap conflicting thrills, although it does point out how vulnerable Rocky is when up against a monster of a man whose desire and drive to triumph appears unnatural given the circumstances. And yes, there is that seemingly obligatory framework to do with Balboa and his personal life clashing with his professional one - his actual walking away from the field in the form of retirement an event which is lost and forgotten by the time everything else has been said and done such is the scope for brutish spectacle and emotional wringers, but it all pulls together.There is room for one of the more predominant characters to be killed off, in what is an affecting scene, whereas the subplot of two rivals from instalments gone by working together is a refreshing touch. There is a raw energy to the film, it keeps itself afloat by going over similar paths up upping antes: Lang is the level up as an opponent from Creed; Rocky has more to loose now in the form of a young son able to be conscientious of the risks his father takes; Balboa seeks training from a man who has been to the same heights he has and most come to learn that the only way from the top is back down again, in spite for prior perceptions of one's ability and status. As Stallone very gradually cranks up the affinity we have towards these characters, one cannot help but look forward to the following entries.",Rocky III
44,leplatypus,A real challenger ! (payTV),10,18 September 2016,"Here in France we consider Sly as a gentle dumb but watching this 3rd round I think he is really underrated ! I discovered Rocky as a teen so at the start of the 90s and the movies really punched me then ! But now i realize that those movies were much older and if we watch them with contemporary eyes, we see that they are really forerunner of the modern American movies ! First of all, if Sly hasn't invented sequels, he is among the first authors to believe in it : back then, we had only Coppola (Godfather), Lucas (Star Wars) and a few others Next, he is also the first author to illustrate scenes with just a song and no dialogues, and what a song : « eye of the tiger ». Still today, it's a rock classic and this song editing is used by everyone now ! Next, as a director, i found Sly has great inspirations with striking angles, close-up, news editing, all things that we see everyday now but back then were original. As an author, we can say whatever but Rocky has a special place in our heart as the movies are true to deep values : efforts, getting up after a blow, friendship, marital life, education, citizenship Here, Rocky is still bound to Philly, he spends some nice time with his son, he has to deal even more with celebrities and fame, and for sure, the punching winner is also a crying man ! But we got also minorities friendship and one more time, there is not a lot movies with that question ! As for acting, all the cast is wonderful as they are totally into their characters and if they don't have much to do, they always achieve to be real ! Talia is fantastic as a supportive wife and newcomer Mr. T spills fury forever ! Finally, i didn't write about the fights and that's why Rocky movies are important and true classic because they tell us so much in addition to boxing !",Rocky III
45,pmtelefon,"Okay, at best.",6,23 June 2019,"I don't watch ""Rocky III"" that often. I don't watch that much because it's not that good. It's actually pretty bad. The biggest problem with the movie is how Sylvester Stallone looks. He has perfect disco hair and way too many muscles. Sly's face looks like it has zero percent body fat and it's very distracting. He doesn't look like Rocky anymore. Another problem is Mr T's character. Clubber Land is a one dimensional cartoon character. Mr T went on to have a good run because he became quite an appealing personality. He gets to show none of that in ""Rocky III"". He just a screaming, insulting (PG style, of course) robot. Another disappointment is the Paulie character. He has a great opening scene and then he turns into comic relief. On the plus side, Sly delivers a pretty good performance and Carl Weathers (also with way too many muscles) is also quite good. Overall, ""Rocky III"" is pretty forgettable.

50,Anonymous_Maxine,Why so serious?,8,26 November 2008,"Like Part 2, Rocky 3 starts off where the last movie left off, but things are totally different now. Rocky has the feel of a real person with a real, three dimensional life by now, but he's come a long way from the Rocky we knew in the first two movies. Most notably, he's RICH now. He has a genuine career going in full swing in boxing by now, and the first part of the movie is a montage of event fights, all of which he wins soundly and comfortably. He is a tremendous champion with 10 successful title defense fights and a whole list of corporate sponsors. Not surprisingly, he begins to feel overconfident and a little lazy.There is some ham-handed foreshadowing as we see clips of a concerned Mr. T in the audience at Rocky's fights, and it's not long before Clubber Lang (Mr. T) begins publicly insulting Rocky, challenging him to a fight and taunting him at press conferences. I'm curious about where Lang's anger comes from. He is clearly furious with Rocky, but we know nothing about him. We don't know anything about his past as a fighter other than what is passed on through dialogue, and the unsolved mystery surrounding his uncontrollable rage is probably the movie's only genuine fault.The important thing that we are told is that Lang is not a boxer, like Rocky, but a wrestler, so it's a completely different, ah, ball game this time. There is an interesting fight that Rocky has midway through the movie with a hulking giant (Hulk Hogan) curiously named ""Thunderlips,"" in an illustration of what had become of his career. He had reached such a level of success that his fights became little more than performances put on to generate ticket sales, but Rocky's humanitarianism shows through, as he sometimes donates all proceeds, as in the case of the fight with Thunderlips, to various charities.But as always, Rocky maintains his laid back demeanor, letting the insults and taunts roll off his back, which is one of the qualities that has really allowed him to win so many hearts. But at an outdoor press conference, Lang taunts Rocky's wife, and he gets genuinely angry for the first time in the first three movies, other than the sudden tantrum he had in the first film when Mickey first asked to be his manager. After this, everything starts to fall apart. It turns out that his championship is not what he thought it was, and he is put into a position where he has to defend his wife's honor as well as his own, and to do that he has to fight a fighter that no one, including himself, really believes he can beat. True to his form, Mickey tells him, ""This guy'll kill you to death inside of three rounds!""And there is no mistake to be made about that. Lang is absolutely a KILLER. This guy has no interest in getting a knockout, he doesn't even seem that interested in being recognized as the real champion, he just wants to hurt Rocky. Essentially Lang's role in the movie is to knock Rocky out of the rut of complacency that he has gotten into. Thunderlips was billed as nearly 7 feet tall and 390 pounds, which I think it roughly twice Rocky's size, and is clearly a wrestler and not a fighter, and yet Rocky was able to win a fight with him, so it's no surprise that he assumed the fight with Lang would be about the same.When they finally fight, Lang walks all over him, and Rocky realizes that he has gotten soft. Apollo Creed, by the way, is now a sportscaster, and becomes Rocky's trainer when they learn how tough Lang really is. The movie loses track a little when Apollo starts training Rocky like he's never been in a gym before, like he's a complete amateur. Yeah, he hasn't been losing much lately, but does that mean he hasn't set foot inside a gym in all those years? Doubtful, but nevertheless, it's great to see Rocky whipping himself back into shape and once again becoming that hardened hero that we have come to love. Although I have to admit, I loved the swimming scene. Rocky swims like my grandmother!There is one moment of almost unforgivable cheese when Rocky and Mickey have a heart to heart on the beach at sunset in which, for example, Rocky claims that he's really afraid for the first time in his life. Isn't that a direct quote from the first movie? There is notably more anger in part three than either of the previous movies, and while a second sequel runs a high likelihood of being the one that marks the first really noticeable turn downwards in the quality of the series (hear that, Terminator?), this one is no less watchable than the first two and, amazingly, neither is part 4. Well done!By the way, it's interesting that, at one point, a sportscaster notes just before a major fight, ""The odds of Rocky making a comeback at 34 are long indeed!"" Yeah, how about at 60?",Rocky III

And we get Action Jackson back, which always makes it feel like a Rocky film.Where this differs from I and II is in the characters... they don't take much time to develop them further. The plot is centered almost entirely around the fight and that kind of makes me miss the depth of the first two... however, it is just as inspiring, it is just as motivating, and in a way that only Rocky films can really pull off.And again we get to see Rocky as the perpetual underdog that has to fight and struggle and only rises to the top through will power and hard work... and that, the concept of a hero that has to struggle, is missed in modern movies.",Rocky III

And who wants to watch a movie about a washed up boxer who is ready to retire? But Mr. T energizes this movie, giving it resuscitation needed so that it can live and say something besides that Rocky's time is over and done with, that Mickey should go home and that Pauly should go back to the meat packing plant. Once Mr.T gets involved, the fireworks go off because it's just a matter of time before he and Stallone have it out, which saves the movie from total oblivion.

54,drqshadow-reviews,Rocky vs. the Law of Diminishing Returns,5,17 October 2020,"Now a heavyweight champion with multiple defenses under his belt, former street-level everyman Rocky Balboa has fallen into complacency, having extinguished the untamed fire that once propelled him to such unlikely heights. In a way, that metaphor works for the film as well as the man. Where the original Rocky was an existential rumination, a study of self-doubt and critically flawed individuals set against the backdrop of a crumbling American metropolis, this third chapter is missing a certain raw edge, a grounding sense of confused humility.If the first film is less about the fight than the sheer weight of its influence, Rocky III finds the opposite position. It's all rock'n'roll training montages, baby-oiled biceps and cinematic haymakers. In that sense, then-unknown costars Hulk Hogan and Mr. T make ideal dance partners. Clearly, neither were recruited for their acting chops. They're here to grunt angrily and look intimidating opposite a ludicrously-shredded Sly Stallone, to give and take a few slow-motion slobberknockers as the story clumsily approaches its final bell. There were hints of it in Rocky II, four years earlier, but at this point the franchise has completely transitioned into a new genre. It's fist-pumping adrenaline whenever possible, with perhaps a few moments set aside for a quick dose of scrappy character intrigue. The charming lo-fi personality of the first film having completely given way to a posh, polished (if mostly soulless) Hollywood gleam.It's not without moments. Carl Weathers is still around, now cast as an ally, and shares an unspoken chemistry with Stallone that's badly needed. The plot's key selling point - fear of replacement - has the inkling of something deep and meaningful, although that remains largely unexplored. The fight scenes all look appropriately powerful, if excessively reliant upon hard-hitting offense. Even as a standalone film, though, I'd see it as thin and watery, to say nothing of its relevance to the groundbreaking original. The big-screen equivalent of a throwaway episode from a long-running TV drama. The pieces are all in place, but they aren't really doing anything interesting.",Rocky III

The testosterone levels in this movie are through the rough and if you're into manly men, I dare say you'll find something to like.I wonder if the first act had basically found the conclusions of Rocky II and then the rest of the movie was the first act of this movie, then we'd really have an epic journey, albeit one with a downer ending. But as intelligent as it is on its depiction of how the mighty can fall in modern sports, the movie doesn't really have anywhere to go except by becoming and cutesy bromance than ends with...well, I'm not going to spoil it but if you can't guess how this resolves then...well I'm not sure what to say.Thee are plenty of incidental fun along the way: a fight with Hulk Hogan, ""I pity the fool"", Eye of the Tiger, Rocky's hubris in various way...it's not a high prestige movie but if you're into what it's selling, it's a fun one.",Rocky III

The premise of the film sees rocky in the high life after winning the title until he is faced with a new young hungry challenger. Sylvester Stallone is back as rocky in this film and wrote and directed this film. He is great in this film, it shows a different side of rocky in this film and he does a great job. The supporting cast is also great, adrians character is good because of how her relationship with rocky develops and it works in this film. Carl weathers is back as apollo creed and this is the best portrayal of the character yet as his relationship with rocky being much better in this film and humanizing. Micky is back and even though he isn't in the film a huge deal he does a great job. This film introduced Mr t as clubber lang and he was a really good villain in this film. The story of the film is decent and the redemption story really works in this film. However, this is a shorter film and it doesn't hit the emotional level that you want it too. The script is alright with some good humour but SD I said the drama sometimes doesn't hit as strongly as you want it too.

57,CubsandCulture,Rocky at its most basic...,6,17 March 2019,"This film really doesn't have much subtext. Whereas the first film is about defending the American dream, and the second film was about male anxiety over changing gender roles this one is about what it is to tell a Rocky story. The charity fight with Hulk Hogan is a clever bit of screenwriting that functions as a meta-commentary. I mean Lang is just a heel after all. But the story is far too stripped down and focused on the fights.Of note Adrian is given basically nothing to do with in this film. There really isn't any marriage struggle in this film; even Rocky's conflict of being afraid is too fight focused. That is really too bad. Add in that the most emotional sequence-Mickey's fate-is used to fuel Rocky's underdog status and the film utterly lacks the emotional strength of the better Rocky films.Lang is a poor substitute for Apollo and without the self-awareness of the wrestling match the character wouldn't work. Mr. T is just awful, even by his standards, in this film. He almost sinks the film. But Mr. T is very good at the stunt work. These are some of the most brutal fights in the series.The best part of the film, and why it is still entertaining, is Apollo. Turning Creed into a frenemy was good move and it set up the Creed films (eventually) quite nicely. Weathers gives a great personable performance here and he saves the film.This film is really transitional. It doesn't have the blue collar feel of the 1st two films. It doesn't quite have the operatic feel of the 4th Rocky, or Rocky Balboa. An entertaining film but the material feels tired and spent.",Rocky III
58,Fluke_Skywalker,Wins by decision,6,24 August 2016,"Plot; After the death of his manager and the loss of his title, boxer Rocky Balboa finds an unlikely ally in his quest to regain the belt in former foe Apollo Creed.Over the years, it's been easy to laugh off the ever growing and increasingly implausible Rocky series. But then Stallone makes Rocky Balboa, not exactly a classic, but a return to basics filled with genuine pathos that brings the character and his saga satisfyingly full circle. This is followed a full decade later by Creed, an almost beat for beat remake of the original Rocky that sees Stallone play the mentor and give what may be the finest performance of his career. It's a fascinating franchise that acts both as a mirror of the times in which they were made and of the soul of its star. Stallone is, for all intents and purposes, Rocky Balboa. The original film essentially ports Stallone's own Hollywood struggles into the ring. The sequel shows how Rocky, and by extension Stallone, dealt with the swift and meteoric rise to fame. This third film too mirrors Stallone's life, as Rocky struggles with maintaining his edge after achieving his dreams. It also is a reflection of its era, replacing the gritty look and tone of its 70s-based predecessors with a slicker, faster approach befitting the dawn of the 80s.As a sequel, Rocky III works reasonably well, taking the next logical step in a story that very well might have been better served stopping after one film. If the basic framework is the same (challenge, train, fight, win), the character motivations are different enough for it to be interesting. Stallone realizes the story, while serviceable, is somewhat thin, and therefore trims about a half hour from the runtime compared to its predecessors. If there's no meat on its bones, there's also precious little fat. Stallone's Rocky feels very different than the one we meet in the original. He's smarter, more sophisticated. A product of his success? Maybe, but it's a jarring evolution until you get used to it. Adrian is now more or less Rocky's lucky rabbit's foot, reduced to cheerleader, which is a shame, but also an organic part of the series' evolution. The real stars here are Carl Weathers as Apollo, now stepping in as Rocky's trainer, and Mr. T as the villain, Clubber Lang. Weathers feels very much like the Apollo we know, but we get to scratch a bit beneath the surface. He's a charming, energetic breath of fresh air when he arrives in the film's second half. Unlike Apollo in the first two films, Clubber Lang is a true villain cut from a very one dimensional mold. Despite this, Mr. T manages to make for a compelling and daunting baddie and lifts the entire film.Rocky III isn't a particularly good film, but thanks in no small part to the good will we feel for the titular character because of the previous two films, it does hold together just enough dramatically to allow its slicker, 80s-tinged elements, to deliver a moderate crowd pleaser.",Rocky III
59,sauravjoshi85,Rocky back with a bang,7,23 April 2020,"Rocky III is a sports drama movie directed by Sylvester Stallone and stars Sylvester Stallone, Talia Shire, Burt Young, Carl Weathers, Burgess Meredith and Mr. T. The movie is third in the Rocky franchise and second directed by Sylvester.As we all know the movie again is entirely based on boxing and the script is predictable but the execution is touching and motivating.Sylvester Stallone once again made his mark with strong acting and good direction. The screenplay gets slow in between but as soon as the movie reaches it's climax the pace again picks up. Talia Shire is a talented actor and done a good job. Burgess Meredith and Burt Young were also impressive but a special mention for Carl Weathers for his acting.The plot is predictable but will not disappoint you. Background music is good. Cinematography is good.Overall the movie will not disappoint you.",Rocky III
60,Cristi_Ciopron,A bit rawer,6,12 March 2010,"The 3rd installment is better and also a lot more exciting than the previous one, here you at least get some brutality, albeit conventional one, instead of family drama; also, Talia Shire looks way better in this flick.A statue is erected in Philadelphia's favorite son's honor. Balboa drinks the cup of the glory.Balboa, now enjoying the benefits of the celebrity and of his fellow citizens' sincere gratitude, is challenged by Clubber Lang, a loner. Clubber, an iron-fisted giant, crushes Balboa in their first encounter.Apollo Creed, insulted by the insensitive and paranoiac Lang, joins forces with Balboa and becomes his trainer, after Mickey's death.Balboa and Lang offer textbook examples of how to behave and how not to; how to train, and how not to. While the overambitious Clubber Lang is a dedicated loner, and a jerk, Balboa's success comes also from a collective effort; the neighborhood joined him in the 2nd movie, his wife and Creed and others help him now. Balboa's victories aren't those of a grudging loner, but those of an open and friendly person.To me, the 3rd flick is the jewel of the franchise. You get three matches (one with the wrestler, a couple with Clubber Lang). Otherwise, it remains a flick for kids, not something very raw or realist, not HOMEBOY material.It remains of course unexplained how Balboa recovered his impaired sight.",Rocky III

66,Movie-ManDan,The Rocky Movie With The Most To Offer.,10,23 January 2015,"The Rocky series is an ongoing Cinderella story. The first one saw him as a poor nobody who got the chance of a lifetime, the second saw him training harder than ever to get the gold, this sees him as a famous athlete who struggles to regain his pride. This is a more unique Cinderella story, making it a great watch.Rocky III has a different feel and tone than the first two. This takes place a few years after Rocky II with him riding high as the most popular boxer in the world. He has a huge house and a shiny life. The light is a better feel than the dark and dreary sense of the first two. Stallone also incorporates more cinematic elements into this. There's a charity fight between Rocky and pro wrestler, Thunder-Lips (played by a lesser-known Hulk Hogan) and it is hilarious. Hogan goes crazy and anarchy erupts. I die laughing at that. The antagonist is Mr. T in his first and best known film role. As Chicago fighter, Clubber Lang, he destroys every opponent in underneath two rounds. Stallone had a hard time finding the right actor to play Clubber Lang, but when he saw T on the show ""Games People Play,"" he was blown away and contacted him right away. T is so good, kick-ass, and over-the-top that you just can't help laughing. Not sure if Stallone intended it on being like that, but I'm glad it was. After Rocky faces ten handpicked opponents and wins, Lang challenges a soft and vain Rocky, much to mentor Mickey's (Meredith) disapproval. Lang destroys Rocky like his other opponents and he is left with no fans. That is until his old nemesis, Apollo Creed steps up and offers to train Rocky for a rematch since Mickey recently passed away. They go back to basics where Rocky must find himself again and regain the edge he lost. Creed is just as funny as Mickey. As you've guessed, Rocky wins his rematch, but in an unrealistic way. He as little blood and bruises than the first, despite taking more punches. Weird! But beating Mr. T is the the most unrealistic but. That's just not possible. But it goes to show what can happen when you persevere.4/4",Rocky III
67,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,An OK sequel to the first two but lost a lot of its umfph,6,28 February 2015,"For the character of Rocky Balboa, success always seemed miles away. Struggling to make it through on a daily basis on the urban streets was never an easy task. His sluggish yet innocent personality made him an obvious target to individuals who wanted to take advantage of him. For all that, everything would change when he went toe-to-toe (twice) with the latest heavyweight boxing champion Apollo Creed. Even after the first fight, Rocky had become nothing short of legend. As for the rematch, it was what solidified his image as the rising star that he was. Rocky (1976) and Rocky II (1979) are the two films that book-ended this story so nicely. Of course there would be a continuation that would be in the form of this feature but did it maintain the same level of quality? It's there, but not as much. It's still a well-made and captivating entry but it lacks the substance that made the first two so gratifying to see.The film begins like it did with its first sequel by recapping the finale of its predecessor and showing how much of a beating Rocky could really take. After winning the title, Rocky then becomes engrossed in his fame by covering promo ads, photo shoots, celebrity show cameos and interviews. Despite this, Rocky ends up confronting a new opponent named Clubber Lang (Mr. T) and discovers he may not be as prepared as he thought, so Apollo Creed returns to get Rocky in shape one last time. As for Stallone's direction on how he wanted Rocky to develop as a character, the idea was absolutely fine. When someone becomes famous and is offered riches beyond their imagination, who wouldn't indulge? The lesson behind it all is that you can't let your guard down, no matter how comfortable you feel. Nonetheless, Stallone's writing misfires a number of times in compensation for his directing.The problems in the screenplay are that unlike its forerunners, there are a couple of scenes that do not add any meaning to the story at hand. Right at the start, Rocky has to confront his Brother-in-law Pauly (Burt Young) about his reckless behavior. Turns out that Pauly is jealous over Rocky's fame, yet the matter is resolved all within the same scene. Another is the charity match between Rocky and Thunderlips (Hulk Hogan). There's nothing wrong with this match up; who wouldn't want to see it? But the fact that it did not move the plot a long in any way other than for the spectacle of Hogan Vs Stallone had no use. These kinds of instances are wasteful. Meanwhile, the audience could have had more sentimental scenes between Rocky and his family. That's not the case though. The audience barely views any family time between Rocky, his wife Adrian and young son.Instead, fans see Pauly constantly complaining and Adrian saying almost nothing important until close to the final act. Along with developing Rocky and his family, his opponent Clubber Lang receives little treatment either. It's hard to say if Clubber Lang's personality is actually Mr. T being himself or not. It's also another thing when a character is determined by something, but Lang doesn't seem to have a reason. Lang has hatred so strong that there's got to be more of a motive than just Rocky ignoring his demands for a match. No one holds that much resentment for a reason like that. Lang really just appears to be fuming out of nowhere for very little reason. Burgess Meredith as Mickey, Carl Weathers as Apollo Creed and Tony Burton as Creed's coach were really the only true redeeming character additions. Meredith is able to provide a touching scene with Rocky and seeing Creed and his former coach team up with Rocky is also a plus. This particular element helps humanize Creed and his followers and makes them even more likable as characters.The other remaining components that do work like before were the music and match fights. The way the fights are choreographed still have life in them and keep the sequences moving at a brisk pace as if to emulate how fast the fists are flying. Credit also goes to Bill Butler, who also was director of photography for Rocky II (1979) and Jaws (1975). Also, because this film represents how far Rocky drifted from his original life (living style), numerous shots contain everything from floor to ceiling of glam and riches galore. It's definitely flashy and displays how much wealth Rocky acquired but it's all style over substance (as explained before). The music composed again by Bill Conti did another efficient job. This time when it came to contemporary music of the time, ""Eye of the Tiger"" is emphasized more than anything else. ""Gonna Fly Now"" is still in there but ""Eye of the Tiger"" was given more priority. The Rocky theme is still played throughout as well along with the softer moments that occur. It's still a decent movie but wasn't executed entirely right.Sylvester Stallone had the right idea on how to continue Rocky's story but his screenplay misses the point by including scenes that go nowhere instead of developing all of its characters like the first two films. Mr. T as Clubber Lang was certainly the right choice for an antagonist but he too barely has much depth. The music and fight sequences all still please to a point with Carl Weathers returning but without all of its developed characters, the heart of the story doesn't feel as strong.",Rocky III
68,Sandcooler,"The birth of ""I pity the fool""",8,26 February 2011,"To start of with a very balanced opinion: I'm deeply in love with this entry. Not only do we get TWO boxing matches between Rocky and Mr.T, he even engages in some boxing/wrestling cross-over against Hulk Hogan at some point. Pretty much everything that was cool in the 80s and then just vanished is incorporated here. It's like the storyboard to this movie was entirely made up from kid's drawings, that's how crowd-pleasing it is. The action is a lot better than in the second, but this third one also stands out when it comes to the characters. You care a lot more about them this time, which makes the sentimental scenes so much more touching. Did I mention this is also the debut of the whole ""eye of the tiger""-thing? It totally is, and it was still really, really awesome back then. One of the best in the series.",Rocky III

He is hilarious.This film now has Rocky being a rich and successful boxer.He one day gets challenged to a match by this amateur boxer named Clubber Lang(Mr.T).They fight and Clubber beats him.So then Rocky's old enemy Apollo Creed befriends him and trains him to beat Clubber Lang.Rocky III is almost the best film of the Rocky series and it just ranks slightly lower than Rocky 1 in my opinion.Still an excellent movie.",Rocky III

And as much as I like the drama of the first two I have to admit that I love the sheer exhiliration of part 3 and 4.  I love this film.Mr. T. is a bad-ass villain.  When you move on from the original story and take away all that Apollo Creed was to Rocky, you have to present the audience with more danger than  the other films had.  And early on you learn to hate Clubber Lang simply for the fact that he wants to take away what Rocky has.  If you can create hatred for a character even though he is not a bad man, that is good writing.  Clubber Lang is the embodiment of hate even though what he represents is will, determination, an insatiable desire for fame and greatness and to win the heavyweight boxing title.  How do you hate a character like that?  Well for one, you make him grunt and spit his words out like venom.  You make him snarl and use words like ""sucka"" and phrases like "" pity the foo"".  And you have to give Mr. T. credit for portraying the role as well as he did.Rocky III is as high on the entertainment scale as you can go and the only film that supercedes it in terms of wanting the underdog to win at all costs, is Rocky IV.

73,jeremycrimsonfox,"A Good Movie, Despite Some Flaws",8,4 August 2019,"Rocky III is a good movie, thought not like the last two. After winning the world heavyweight championship, Rocky Balboa has a good title defense, and even starts to get popular and appearing in commercials, TV show, and even getting merchandise. But during that time, Clubber Lang (played by the mighty Mr. T), a young boxer on the rise, has saw his fights, and manages to dethrone him, especially as Mickey suffers a fatal heart attack. However, Rocky gets a chance at a rematch, and Apollo Creed, the man he beat in the last film, decides to step in as manager to help him get his edge back.It is a good movie, but as it does follow the same formula, the third time is when it starts to get stale. While it does keep things fresh with a new antagonist (Clubber Lang) and some good scenes (like Rocky in a charity fight with wrestling champion Thunderlips, played by real-life professional wrestler Hulk Hogan), and the death of Mickey, it follows the same formula as the last two films. The music is still awesome (especially when Eye Of The Tiger by Surivior is used in the opening montage).",Rocky III
74,jaredmobarak,Predictions? PainRocky III,4,18 November 2007,"After all these years, I finally had the opportunity to watch my least favorite of the Rocky series, Rocky III, again. With the new installment, Rocky Balboa, having just reinvigorated my enjoyment in the saga, I couldn't wait to see a true tragedy with this one. I'll say that it did not end up that way entirely. I actually had a real good time watching it. Upon completion, I turned to my friends and said, ""that wasn't as bad as I remembered."" They replied by saying, ""yeah, but I'm sure we didn't laugh that much the first time we saw it either."" So, I am not going to declaring this a masterpiece by any means. Truthfully, the score I gave it from the memory of years back will stay the same. Maybe I would have increased it if the film's goal was to be a comedy, but since it tried to be a drama, it did ultimately fail.I give full credit to Sylvester Stallone. He wrote the original and ended up starring in it on more accident than anything else. He took that classic and turned it into a franchise beloved by many. This entry just has too much of its era on displaythe 80's are in full force. I understand what he tried, showing how success and the Me-lifestyle of the decade turned a champ into a chump. Some really great stuff happens too: Mickey saying that he had been protecting him and keeping him out of contenders' grasps, Apollo Creed coming to his defense as a promoter, and Adrian stepping up and telling her husband how it is, despite her wanting him to retire. The bad just outweighs the good way too much. Between the circus in the hotel training facility, Hulk Hogan's embarrassing cameo, Mr, T's street version of Muhammad Ali trash-talk, Burt Young's ridiculous remarks at every turn, and Sly's new wardrobe, I shook my head in shame the whole time. The real travesty, though, is that Mickey had to go out in such an inferior product.Along with all the unintentional laughter, the re-training of Balboa at the hands of Creed and DukeCarl Weathers and Tony Burton carry the filmis fantastic stuff. The montages are cheesy and each scene drips melodrama, but the thought is what counts. Making a slugger become faster and graceful is an interesting spin and makes perfect sense. Maybe Sly just needed a script doctor to hone his good ideas into a more enjoyable whole. As is, though, while the underlying themes and progression of the series is worthwhile, the fluff just drags it all down into the gutter.",Rocky III

Stallone manages to bring some freshness to the Rocky saga and it's all well played out. The leading characters are fleshed out a bit more and Stallone once again shows that he's quite the talented writer.

Rocky III is not as good as # 1 but remains superior to parts # 2, # 4 and # 5 (The jury is still out on Rocky VI) mainly due to Mr. T who is easily the series' most enjoyable villain. Mr. T taunts, intimidates and overall demolishes Rocky for the first half and really it is quite believable on why Rocky might not want to get back in the ring. Still Rocky III suffers from some silliness such as the whole Hulk Hogan cameo as well as some philosophy from Carl Weathers but really Rocky III isn't bad as these things go and I for one quite enjoyed not only the fight but basically everything about it.* * * out of 4-(Good)",Rocky III
77,KnightsofNi11,The series gets a lot weaker with this one,5,1 September 2012,"The Rocky saga continues with Sylvester Stallone in the director's chair again for Rocky III. Keeping with the Rocky formula, Rocky III opens with the end of Rocky II, where Rocky wins the fight against Apollo Creed and claims the heavyweight champion title. We then jump forward three years with the help of your typical Rocky montage where Rocky becomes a huge celebrity and the absolute pride of Philladelphia. However, when a new young challenger comes along, Rocky has no choice but to face him. This challenger? None other than Clubber Lange, played by the infamous Mr. T in his film debut. In the fight Rocky takes a brutal beat down from Clubber, and afterwards looks to former rival, Apollo Creed to train him in order to restore his confidence.I have to admit, for me, watching a Rocky film is a lot of fun. It's empowering, inspiring, and always seems to be a great experience. But, as much as I enjoy a good Rocky flick I can't deny that Rocky III is a pretty half hearted attempt. It feels shoddily thrown together in an attempt to churn out another run of the mill story. The film's flow seems too sped up and doesn't go deep at all. It has some good heartfelt moments, but overall just feels very phoned in. The Rocky films seem to get progressively more predictable and less original. Rocky III offers up nothing new, and it's where the series redundancy really starts to show. I won't say that the previous two films suffer from the third, but Rocky III is definitely very forgettable.Of course, the film isn't without a few good things. You can expect to see some of your favorite things about Rocky films in Rocky III. You'll be treated to some great montages, even though this film has a total of three I believe, and for a 100 minute runtime this is sort of overdoing it. We also get to see the characters of Rocky, Adrian, and Apollo grow and mature to continue to be ever fascinating characters. Kudos go to Sylvester Stallone to keeping his characters fresh, it's just a shame he couldn't do the same with the storyline. Also, as with the previous two Rocky films, you can expect a rousing climax in Rocky III. It's inspiring and empowering to watch Rocky fight at the end of the film, and it almost makes you forget how mediocre the rest of the film is.All in all, don't expect much from Rocky III. It's the weakest of the first three films by a long shot, but if you enjoyed the first two then I would say give this one a shot if you haven't satisfied your Rocky fever quite yet. It's not a disaster, but Rocky III is pretty underwhelming.",Rocky III
78,ivo-cobra8,Rise and fall from grace - undoubtedly tied best classic movie with IV!,10,3 November 2015,"Rocky III (1982) is definitely tied best Rocky film with IV. It is my third favorite Rocky film. The first one will always be the best. I think the third entry of the franchise is a big improvement over Rocky II in my opinion. He's on top of the world now, bags a statue, and for some reason, Adrian became attractive in this one. Like, REALLY attractive. He got soft, he got arrogant, and he got lazy. He lost his trainer, his title, and most of all, his self-respect to one of the most that makes me angry villains ever to grace the silver screen: Mr. T's Oscar-robbed performance as Clubber Lang and had to regain the 'eye of the tiger' to get it all back in front of the world. This one also proves further that Apollo Creed is human. Guy went from an arrogant prick and sore loser to Rocky's finest ally. Kudos, Carl. I love Mr. T he become famous after this movie there is also Hulk Hogan in it. Adrian in this movie is very supportive and I love Apollo how he was helping Rocky. Rocky III has a heart beside Rocky I.Why I love this film? This is the only Rocky film in which Adrian is well written - to further support my stance that III fires on all cylinders. Really, what purpose does Adrian serve in II, IV and V? She spends most of those movies telling Rocky not to fight - she is not supportive and just a burden to him. In this one, she actually encourages him and is an asset (speach on the beach.) Heck, there wouldn't be much of Rocky II if not for her objections to. It is the best all around Rocky movie. On a literary level (story), entertainment level, filmmaking level, boxing choreography, characters, etc... The fight at the end actually means something for Rocky. He has something to gain from it (unlike V.) This and Rocky I are the ONLY two Rocky movies where Adrian actually encourages Rocky the whole time (unlike II, IV, and V.) Mr. T is perfectly cast. It was so successful because it was the best. Rocky lost everything his manager, his title, his self respect and mostly he lost his edge! Like Apollo said ""Now, when we fought, you had that eye of the tiger, man; the edge! And now you gotta get it back, and the way to get it back is to go back to the beginning."" That's what I love. When you lose something don't quit. You need gained back the thing you lost. I love how Apollo motivated Rocky in this film and I think Apollo is well written and portrayed in here. I seriously I think Carl Weathers did a wonderful job portraying arrogant Apollo to an awesome Rocky's friend, to a support and ally. I was surprised Apollo was back in the third entry of the Series franchise. I love the training sequences and the music Score by Bill Conti the same score he used in Rocky I, and II. The same year that Sylvester Stallone made Rocky III the same year he went and started in First Blood, his famous role to this days Rambo! Carl Weathers also said that Rocky III is his favorite film he made. Not only that it is the only Rocky sequel film who won another Oscar award, which is the only one. Beside Carl Weathers I think Mr. T was the best actor portraying a villain in this movie I love how he provoked Rocky I really love that. This is the only film the lasted three rounds. The film has two fight with Clubber Lang (Mr. T) and more fights in which Rocky and Clubber are attending too in the opening scene. Rocky fights a wrestler Thunderlips (Hulk Hogan) in this film. I also love the music score Eye of the Tiger performed by Survivor! I love this film it is my third best favorite rocky film alongside with Rocky IV. The rating I am giving is 9.5/10, I would have give it 10, I didn't because Mickey dies in this film and that was the most shocking disturbing scene to me. Three years and 10 successful title defenses after beating Apollo Creed, with whom he has become great friends, a now wealthy Rocky Balboa is considering retirement. Fame and complacency soon cause Balboa to lose his title to Clubber Lang, who inadvertently causes the death of Rocky's trainer Mickey. Rocky sinks into a depression, and Apollo decides to train Rocky for a rematch against Lang so Rocky can try to win the title back. That is the basic main plot. Rocky III is a 1982 American film written, directed by, and starring Sylvester Stallone. It is the third installment in the Rocky film series, and the second in the franchise to be directed by Stallone.9.5/10 Grade: A",Rocky III

In 1980, United Artists, which owned the rights to the Rocky films, made O Portal do Paraíso, a film that cost 44 million dollars and won only 3 million. In response, the owner of United Artists, Transamerica, sold United Artists to MGM, forming MGM / UA in 1981. In this sequence, after being defeated by Clubber Lang (Mr. T), a new and fearsome opponent, Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) is now trained for the rematch fight by Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), his former rival, who wishes Rocky only a small favor in exchange for his services.This time, Stallone decided to bring new elements to the franchise, in this episode that was originally conceived as the end of a trilogy. Rocky III has some problems, few changes and the repetition of the formula of the previous works, which leads to clichés and a very predictable script: the provocation, the upsurge after the drama and the problems, the extra motivation for training, and for Here it goes. The old victory of the good hero who triumphs over the boring and arrogant villain. Nothing new, let alone exciting. But there are also merits. In previous productions, Rocky was not a professional, but ended up fighting the talented Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) by a stroke of chance. Now, ten years after the victory, the protagonist is properly inserted in the sports market: he works in television commercials, lives in a luxurious house with his wife (Talia Shire), has defended the title several times. Apollo is retired, and it is up to Rocky to fight another black, arrogant and troublemaker: Clubber Lang.No, Rocky Balboa is not going to fight Apollo Creed again. At least this is not the central plot. By changing the perception and giving a greater prominence to Creed, in addition to addressing racism and other social aspects a little - remembering that it is a film from the 80's that makes the chemistry between Apollo and Rocky (and obviously between the actors) and the transformation from the ex-rival to a friend, trainer and motivator, they are sure and perhaps the best of the film. Creed, which was already loved by many viewers, becomes even more acclaimed by the public. The rivalry that becomes friendship and respect usually works both in life and in sports as well as on the screen. It all set the stage for Rocky IV.
But the worst character, without a doubt, is Clubber. Built as a kind of animal man, howling in each scene, he becomes the classic villain, the man devoid of complexity. Without a minimum of dramatic talent, Mr. T. screams and snorts to exhaustion, but he has no great motivation for his villainy (as was the case with Apollo's pride and media talent in previous films). While Rocky had turned into a star who was now finally able to star in advertisements and whose training seemed to be part of show business, Clubber Lang was hard-pressed to get in the best shape possible, especially after defeating Rocky in the first confrontation and accepting the rematch. For the first time, Rocky's only goal is to win the fight, something that impoverishes the franchise. The 1976 and 1979 films were successful in making sport an effective metaphor for the United States, but in this case, sport is nothing more than the classic stage for the fight for good against evil.Stallone also knows how to film the dramatic moments, which had already been evidenced in the previous film. Rocky's defeat in his first fight against Lang, for example, is memorable because it is one of the only moments in the saga where we see a long shot in the ring, exacerbating the protagonist's fall on the canvas. And his final scene with Mickey, played out on a fixed plane, reveals Stallone's maturity as a director, as well as his efficient talent for dramatic scenes.
Unlike the narrative structure of the first two films, here we have a fight before an hour of projection, which fuels fans' desire to see Rocky more time in the ring, but Mickey's moving death transforms the atmosphere of the film - and Stallone broadcasts the character's pain with such passion that it makes us suffer even more. Bill Butler's photography then radically changes and brings out the dark look, notable when Apollo emerges to convince Rocky to fight again and be trained by him. Except that, psychologically devastated, Rocky is unable to perform in the first training sessions, even with all the support of his friend Apollo. Adopting a more relaxed posture, Carl Weathers gives the character more humanity and his empathy with Stallone is essential to the film's success. The friendship of the two, in fact, is one of the highlights of the film. Adrian, who also shows enormous evolution, is now a much more confident and confident woman, able to speak with authority in the remarkable dialogue on the beach where he questions Rocky and all his suffering and makes him find the strength to return to training with the same determination as before , taking us to the already traditional training sequence packed by the classic ""Gonna Fly Now"", but which now does not appear as inspired and exciting as the previous ones, perhaps due to the different environment and the pace employed by editors Mark Warner and Don Zimmerman.For anyone who was used to that raw reality that was, in a way, portrayed in the first two films, you may be disappointed with this episode of the franchise. First because everything that was attractive in the film, which, incredible as it may seem, was not limited to struggles, disappears as if by magic here. What may have been the biggest problem for the franchise, is that the fights were not the culmination of the film. They became the culmination due to all the walking, the route and the obstacles that appeared in front of the main characters. In Rocky III, the viewer no longer has to wait for the climax, in the final third of the story, to see the hero in action. A first fight takes place from the beginning, in a fast, somewhat comical scene. The famous training sequence, in ellipses, is also shown more than once. The second film increased the intensity of the feelings, but the third prefers to multiply the action, transforming itself into a history of struggle like so many others.
The film stops being a project with a social morality and becomes a blockbuster, with a lot of image, a story, but almost nothing of content. I do not say here that the film is empty before the history of the franchise. The series is so interconnected in itself that it is difficult for you to watch Rocky Balboa today, without having seen the previous films, since many details are revived in each new episode of the saga. However, the third film completely forgets these small details and transforms the feature film (one of the shortest in the franchise's duration) into just something not so relevant, that you may not even need it to follow the series. The direction is more electric, showing up a little accelerated in some moments, but without disturbing the assembly of the scenes.Although it manages to convey emotion by placing us inside the ring with the camera moving around a lot without leaving us confused and the sound design giving greater realism to what we see on the screen through the sound of the blows and the reactions of the audience and narrators, the fight The final formula follows the same formula as the previous ones and showed some wear. Aware of this, the script reserves an intimate, friendly and extremely important moment to bring us even closer to Rocky and Apollo by bringing them enjoying themselves in a private rematch, hidden from the general public. There, they leave the pantheon of the champions and become two normal people, with doubts, anxieties, anxieties and desires, cleaning up in a relaxed way something that bothered them for some time. The movie still hits when it closes before the first blow, leaving the doubt about who would win that private duel, since, in the end, the result doesn't matter. We already know the most important thing about those two great men.Rocky III's aesthetics can be further loaded with zooms, slow motion cameras and tacky sound effects and soundtrack. To portray the pain of death of an important character, Stallone uses all the resources worthy of a cheap serial. With the downgrading of narrative sophistication, the franchise gained a larger audience, reaching the second best box office in the saga (very close to Rocky IV's record). However, in cinematographic terms, this is the weakest point of the saga, which abandoned the richness of its characters and the beautiful melancholy of Rocky, a Fighter to offer only the generic figure of the winner.Despite having good moments and maintaining some important characteristics of the series, ""Rocky III"" showed the first signs of wear on the formula that enshrined the fighter. Fortunately, like his character, Stallone knew how to reinvent himself and would not follow this path for long This is a minor work in the history of the franchise and is well below the second film, which in turn already had a considerable distance to be compared with the excellent original feature film. Still, it is worth the curiosity to follow all stages of the history of the series starring Sylvester Stallone.",Rocky III
80,Ruskington,"A little less conversation, a little more action",6,13 April 2020,"Having been underwhelmed by the first Rocky movie and disappointed by the sequel, I was not expecting much from this latest incarnation. However, it's actually quite good and probably my favourite of the series. It doesn't take itself as seriously as its predecessors, it's much shorter and there's a lot more action. The fighting scenes are also better; more strategic, more engrossing and more realistic (although Rocky would still die multiple times if this was real).I really enjoyed the inclusion of Mr T and Hulk Hogan. Both are quite cabaret in this film and it really helps lighten everything up. Stallone's acting is as bad as ever but he looks amazing in this movie. Admittedly he looks more like a bodybuilder than a boxer but it's still an incredible sight. Talia Shire isn't as prominent in this film as the others but she is still comfortably the best actor on show. I was kind of glad to see the end of Meredith Burgess however, as his character was becoming increasingly banal and cliched.This is a much more light-hearted offering than the first two movies, and while this may irk hardcore Rocky fans, I found it to be a big positive.",Rocky III
81,afonsobritofalves,The best third movie ever.,8,18 September 2018,"Although not as good as the first two films, it is very good and is arguably one of the best thirteenth films ever.

In addition he had a great casting, with Sylvester Stallone, Talia Shire, Burt Young, Mr. T, Carl Weathers and Burgess Meridith. Highly recommend.",Rocky III
82,Maziun,Good third movie,6,21 July 2013,"I think Sylvester Stallone should end the story of Rocky here . It would be a fitting end for the most famous boxer in history of cinema. I like forth one , but as a entertainment movie . ""Rocky 5"" was a misstep and it's good that ""Rocky Balboa"" ended the franchise with style. Still , I think that three Rocky movies were more than enough. Oh well , I can't do anything about it.""Rocky 3"" works really well as a third act of Balboa's story . It's not just another movie in the franchise . For me , it brings the story to full circle. In first movie we are introduced to Rocky, a boxer that has to fight both in the ring and in life for everything . He doesn't even dream of fame , yet he gets a chance from destiny to change his life . In second movie he changes . He wants fame and money . He loses himself . Thankfully he is able to realize that and comes back to his old self. ""Rocky 3 "" is a story about a man who lost his touch . He's the same likable , honest , good guy we met . Yet he's different. He lost his passion , his hunger , his magic (for lack of better word). He's burnt out . This is something many of us can relate to . We don't know what is the reason that our beloved director has stopped making good movies or why our favorite band can't record album as good as before . Nobody knows . It's hard to achieve success , but it's even harder to life with that success . To not fail . To not become a shadow of himself. ""R3"" is a story about how hard is to come back to the top . It's kind of a prophecy for Stallone who disappeared somewhere in the mid 90's and came back triumphant in 2006 with Rocky Balboa. It's also a story about defeating your own fear .Mr.T who plays Clubber Lang represents a new generation of boxers – young , violent , aggressive , with no respect for anybody and anything. In a way he's a darker version of Balboa. T gives a good performance . He's different than Creed and memorable , so Stallone did good job with finding a worthy opponent for Balboa.Sylvester Stallone , Burgess Meredith , Burt Young , Talia Shire and Carl Weathers bring back the good acting they shown us before. Watch out for Chino ""Fats"" Williams in small episode of drunk homeless man and for Hulk Hogan (sic !) as wrestler Thunderlips . ""Rocky 3"" works as a solid sport drama . I could live without the boxing match between Stallone and Hogan . It belongs more to ""Rocky 4"" and doesn't fit in to overall serious tone of the movie . The fights are exciting and quite realistic, especially compared to ""Rocky 4"" (it's still a movie, so you need some suspension of disbelief) . The direction is solid . The training montage is inspirational and don't forget about great song ""Eye of the tiger"" by Survivor (it was nominated for Oscar).I give it 7/10.",Rocky III
83,ghostfiendghost,"Enjoyable, but weaker",6,23 October 2019,"Honestly, Mr. T's character is intimidating but he doesn't play someone I fear more than might.

84,rebeljenn,the most emotional Rocky,2,20 March 2006,"'Rocky III' is the third part in the Rocky story. This is the part where they should have stopped, after this film. (It does have some good moments, but it is not nearly as good as the previous two.) It goes all downhill from here on out. After the death of a dear friend and personal trainer, Rocky and Apollo team up together to train Rocky to get him back competing. This is a story about loss and about trying to get back onto one's feet again after dealing with loss. It's a touching story, but I don't think it is as strong, and I do not think the fighting scenes and the production was as good as the second one. See it if you are a fan.",Rocky III
85,EijnarAmadeus,The third rocker,7,21 February 2007,"Rocky III is a raucous movie, Sly returns as the number one anabolic Hollywood star as he goes for another knockout. Although Rambo III has got some of the strengths of the two earlier movies, and it's a necessary movie in the Rocky-franchise because it shows a Rocky always maturing as he faces personal problems and sorrows. But Rocky III is far from a great movie, the straight-forward production and final finish makes the movie grand for watching boxing-action, but nothing more - Mr. T's ticked off Clubber Lang is nothing more than irritating and the family drama of Rocky reaches a certain point were it's simply not interesting. But one thing Sylvester Stallone really deserves is the fact that he manages making the movie both believable and enjoyable enough that when the movie is finished you feel both entertained and good. (And one thing's for sure; you'll miss Burgess in the fourth coming).",Rocky III
86,tonypeacock-1,Franchise territory come in. Makes for less of an impact?,6,23 April 2020,Okay I get the feeling with this film that Rocky has entered franchise territory and the film makers are cashing in on the character.The film begins with Rocky installed as world heavyweight boxing champion and on a ten fight defence of his title.The character seems to be cashing in on his success with lucrative product placements and charity appearances including a funny fight against wrestling champion Thunderlips (Hulk Hogan).The film has a new angle with Rocky changing his lifestyle and training habits with the influence of a certain Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers).As in earlier entries the boxing choreography is quite poor when considering that Sylvester Stallone receives a screen credit for it is understandable I suppose.Rocky is more athletic towards the end of the film allowing plenty of muscular boxing posing.A bit of a let down on the highs and quite good highs of the first two films respectively.One high point is the soundtrack featuring the song 'Eye Of The Tiger' by Survivor. An excellent song.,Rocky III
87,manitobaman81,Good,7,28 August 2014,"Stallone is good when he is bad and good when he is good, so no point in dwelling on him. Rocky has been holding the title as the heavyweight champion until he is defeated by a brutal challenger, and now must regain his fighting spirit through a big rematch, trained by an unlikely ally: his old nemesis Apollo Creed. This is the kind of film that proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one. This is probably the worst of the sequels. By this film the series became even more unwatchable and somehow even more redundant. This is one of those movies that the star isn't only in for the paycheck. I give it a rating of 7/10.",Rocky III
88,Hayden-86055,"Noticeable drop in quality, but still a solid and enjoyable film",7,1 October 2020,"Sylvester Stallone sacrifices plot for action and hilariously uplifting montage scenes with the equally brilliant Carl Weathers. Mr T plays a fun if outrageously over the top baddie and Burgess Meredith's small role is played as well as before.My main critique is not of the acting which is still first class, but the storyline - or lack of - it's pretty simple stuff this time around and the final boxing match which Rocky wins in an early round didn't have as much tension as the other times, he lost to Mr T before, we all knew he'd win now.Music wise, eye of the tiger is a great song though and even if you haven't seen this film you would have heard it somewhere! The sound effects are still quite cheesy but it just adds to it positively.7/10: Obviously a must watch if you're a Rocky fan, but I feel the quality took a small dive here. It still has excellent music and is very uplifting though.",Rocky III
89,MattyGibbs,Action packed and another excellent sequel,8,5 April 2015,Most franchises are showing signs of flagging by the 3rd film but the Rocky series defies this as Rocky 3 is another absorbing film. Rocky has made it to world champion and is enjoying the fruits of success. That is until Clubber Lang comes onto the scene ( an impressively aggressive Mr T ). This entry features more fights and a charity boxing v WWE match between Rocky and Hulk Hogan. It's an explosive mix and this film doesn't slow down for a minute. Not that it's all action as it does feature one of the saddest scenes in all the Rocky films. The final bout is suitably hard hitting and I loved the very final scene. For fans of the originals this is another treat and again this is another entry that holds up well today.,Rocky III

He lives in peace with his wife Adrian and leaves behind that Apollo ghost. In this way, we can analyze the film as an action film. The story manages to cheer the viewer, since we will follow a new training of Rocky, with some improbable help. Despite having different directions, the film drops its production a little bit.

Talia Shire, Burt Young, Burgess Meredith and Carl Weathers return in their respective roles. Mr T is very memorable as the ferocious Clubber Lang. Mr T is well liked thanks to his role as B.A. Baracus in The A Team, as well as garnering a reputation as a role model for young children.

Rocky is no longer struggling with fame. A man who couldn't film a simple commercial in Rocky II is now making all sorts of endorsements. He could barely drive a car in Rocky II, now he can now drive with ease. Rocky has also become a more intelligent man instead of the dum dum he was in first two movies. Not to mention does he looks different, very handsome I might add and in such physical shape. I think Stallone looks like Al Pacino here, especially when wearing a suit.Rocky III brought the series in a different direction, distant from the first two movies. But despite Rocky's wealth and fame, Rocky III is not a movie which cheapens out. The primary theme of the movie is about Rocky's fame making him soft or as Mickey puts it, ""You got civilised"". Once Rocky discovers Mickey has been hand picking fighters his seemingly perfect bubble of a life is burst; ""You wake up after a few years, thinking you're a winner, but you're not, you're really a loser"". This continues the series theme of being semi-autobiographical of Stallone's own life as the movie examines what fame and fortune can do to a person. Adrian's role is smaller is time round although her character still sees an evolution as the famous lifestyle has taken away her shyness and made her more outspoken and pretty hot too I might add. Just listen to the words of motivation she gives Rocky on the beach; a far cry from the Adrian in the first movie.Even when Rocky discovers Mickey has been hand picking fighters prior to his first fight with Clubber Lang, Rocky is training in the most superficial gym. It's full of photographers and visitors, musicians are playing and merchandise is being sold. Unsurprisingly he gets the worst beating of his life at the hands of Clubber Lang. The solution to Rocky getting his so-called ""eye of the tiger"" back; get away from the superficiality of his wealthy lifestyle and back to the nitty-gritty. As Apollo Creed puts it, ""Man, when we fought, you had that eye of the tiger man, the edge! And the only way to get it back is to go back to the beginning; you know what I'm saying?"". I stick by these words as some of the wisest words I've heard uttered in a motion picture. Whenever you lose your mindset of determination whether physically or mentality, go back to where you first started in order to reclaim it. Rocky III humanises Apollo Creed with Rocky and Apollo becoming friends being a great spin on the story. I always think of his intense shouting of ""There is no tomorrow!"" whenever I need some motivation.The hypnotic, uneasy music which plays when Rocky is training poorly under Apollo and stuck with the threat of living with failure reminds me of Bernard Herman's score to Vertigo in possibly the most uneasy scenes in the series. Likewise, the scene of Paulie in the arcade has to be the most surreal scene in the entire series in which he throws a bottle pinball machine in slow motion complete with odd sound effects; it's an image which doesn't leave your head.Mr. T as Clubber Lang, oh man! What a beast! A true larger than life villain with outbursts of immensely entertaining lightning fast dialogue; he sure has a way with words with such a violent temper and high levels of anger. You do not want to be stuck in an elevator with this guy. Which raises the question; is Clubber responsible for the death of Mickey by pushing him to the side? Yet even close to death Mickey can still inspire with scenery-chewing words of motivation; his death being one of the series most emotional moments. The boxer vs. wrestler charity fight on the other hand between Rocky and Thunderlips (Hulk Hogan) has nothing to do with the rest of the movie but dam is it entertaining. It's so over the top with such intense pain on display. The referee and police officers are thrown to the side, the audience is assaulted and even Paulie gets in on the action (I do love those bits of humour Paulie provides).The final fight in Rocky III is the only in ring fight in the series which takes place in real time until Creed. Meanwhile, the final scene of the movie is such fun, with Rocky and Apollo playing off each other which along with the training montage gives off some homoerotic vibes along the way with sweaty, shirtless, muscular men in tank tops as well as men hugging and jumping in the sea.Also, the film's trailer refers to Rocky III as an ""American tradition"". What's the tradition? Hollywood sequels?",Rocky III
104,OMTR,To hell and back,10,8 March 2019,"In this third installment of the saga, Sly is still directing and puts all his heart and soul into it as always. He explores how celebrity impacts a man's life; its euphoric and destructive effects on the personality. Three important matches mark this episode: The first is an exhibition match against wrestler ""Thunderlips"", embodied by the famous professional wrestler Hulk Hogan. Then follows a mortifying defeat against Clubber Lang, interpreted magnificently by the dark and impressive Mr. T, while Mickey is leaving us. Finally, a reconquest of the world title after mourning Mickey and regaining ""the eye of the tiger""! Thanks to Apollo, who becomes his coach, and to his faithful wife Adrian, who shows a strong character here, when she was very shy at the beginning, and encourages Rocky to fight not only in the ring but above all in life! To hell and back: Rocky III is an effective, breathtaking, and motivating story, so much so that it is used as a reference tool in the physical and mental preparation of many people, who have to face a harsh trial in their life. Emmanuèle Bernheim wrote a beautiful book about this topic, simply entitled ""Stallone"". It narrates the tough obstacle course of a person to whom life throws a lot of hits. Thanks to the inspiration of Sly in general, and Rocky III in particular, the character is able to take the hits, go the distance and win in the end. Personally, I have also used this film for all my exams and most important challenges and setbacks in my life since 1988.
Physically, Stallone inflicted a drastic diet on himself again to lose 20 to 40 pounds through the absorption of ten egg whites and a toast per day. And then regain the same weight, in muscle mass only, during the shooting via the consumption of cereals, fish, high doses of honey coffee and intense physical training. Abnegation, inspiration, writing, preparation, directing and incarnation of Rocky Balboa; Sylvester Stallone is an author and one of the great figures of the contemporary American cinema! Congratulations Rocky and Adrian, we love you: You push us, too, to never give up, always give the best of ourselves and roll with the punches.",Rocky III
105,TheHonestCritic,"This film took the ""Rocky"" franchise and elevated it to a whole new level. How does it hold up?",10,10 October 2020,"""Rocky III"" (1982), we have come to the third film in the ""Rocky"" franchise. Usually, the third film in most movie series is hit or miss. Most of the time, the third film is where the series has the tendency to lose it's charm. However, ""Rocky III"" is the epitome of a third movie done right. It has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and of course a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. The storyline in this film is unique, compared to the first two movies. Yet, it still follows a resembling format to the previous films, which is what the third movie should do. All of the acting is nothing short of stellar every single one of the actors and actresses. They take their performances and dial them up to 11! It just goes to show that their respectable characters have continued to grow on them and they're evolving in just the right way. In this movie, we have a couple of new characters. The best addition has to be Clubber Lang, who is also the main antagonist. He is played by Mr. T, who gives the character such a unique personality. A character that you just love to hate, which makes his defeat all the more satisfying. All of the sets/locations in this film are fantastic and give this movie a great atmosphere. There aren't that many special effects utilized in this film. But, whenever there are any, they all still hold up to this day. Finally, the soundtrack composed by Bill Conti is nothing short of outstanding. Bill Conti is one of my top 10 all-time favorite film score composers, and this soundtrack is nothing short of a masterpiece. ""Rocky III"" takes the concept of the first two movies and raises the bar. It expresses a unique plot, while also keeping a resembling format to the ""Rocky"" series. I can watch this movie over and over again and never get tired of it. Of course, I give this film 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Rocky III"", go check it out today. Before you go and watch this movie, make sure that you watch the first two films first. If not, ""I pity the fool!""",Rocky III

For the past 4 years he's been giving Rocky good fighters to defend the Title against but not killers like Lang because Mickey was worried That Rocky could be killed his injuries from the Creed fights was that severe so Mickey helped him get ten easy Title Defenses. The Public doesn't care to them Rocky is a hero. When rocky meets Lang he loses Everything The Heavy Weight Championship and Mickey. His life spirals into a downward spin until a friend from the past offers to help him out once again Enter Apollo Creed. Rocky 3 Was the best in the series and to many it still is the fact that Stallone finds ways to put Rocky into hardships is inventive and let's Face it Rocky 3 is the sleekest and the most attractive looking of the series it mirrors Rocky's life.

107,Brian-272,A fresh life for the Rocky series. Stallone once again proves to be the master of making a sequel.,6,18 November 2000,"Stallone goes the rounds as both writer and director in this the third installment of the Rocky series, and a winner is produced. Rocky III is often described as Sylvester Stallone vs. Mr. T. Much more can be found and learned from Rocky III the film for one contains emotion, love, sadness, dedication, and friendship but most of all the once again discovery of ""The Eye Of The Tiger"". You have it Rocky (Stallone) the heavyweight champion of the world makes ten straight title defenses with no problem, but complacency plagues Rocky who shows his odd manner by taking a circus act charity wrestling match against Thunderlips (Hulk Hogan). The lack of training hurts Rocky and he suffers a crushing KO at the hands of punishing challenger Clubber Lang (Mr. T) nearly at the same moment Mickey (Burgess Meredith) suffers a KO to his life in a physical sense only later to die with Rocky crying over him in the dressing room. Death actually occurs in two separate means with the death of Mick it's in a literal sense really happening and with the knockout title loss that Rocky (Stallone) suffered in a sense a figurative death occurred though not in an exact sense, but a title loss felt like death to Rocky (Stallone). I could see the graphic match technique was used to compare the loss and death scene, that's exactly what graphic match does it ties the story together with issues representing both a literal and figurative meaning. After the defeat Stallone once again meets up with former opponent and friend and think god Rocky has a friend Appollo Creed (Carl Weathers) who trains to help him once again discover ""The Eye Of The Tiger"". Wife Adrian (Talia Shire) supports Rocky to bury the past and to not once again become complacent, and to not bear the burden of Mick's death because guilt will only destroy, by once again believing in yourself and soul searching ""The Eye Of The Tiger"" can be found. In the rematch with Lang which went three rounds with a KO going to Rocky ""The Eye Of The Tiger"" was discovered. See a fresh start and be like millions of others and discover ""The Eye Of The Tiger"".",Rocky III
108,patches89,I PITY THE FOOL!,7,18 November 2020,Like so many franchises the first 2 films trailblaze it and then theres a drop off and the drop off starts with this one. It focuses more on the fighting than the story as Rocky has been defending his belt against less than worthy fighters until he accepts a fight against Clubber Lang (Mr T) who is a more powerful fighter than anyone hes faced and loses. The loss haunts him and calls on help from old rival Apollo Creed in a bid to reclaim his belt. Again another brilliantly choreographed fight ensues with a happy end for Rocky. Its a very good film just without any of the meat from the previous film,Rocky III
109,projectsgamer,One of the best,8,25 June 2021,Rocky III is about Rocky Balboa is rich and famous beyond his dreams and starts to other things which made him lazy overconfident the first fight and while they are getting ready to fight Clubber Lang pushes Mickey and he dies from having a heart attack for rocky that really messed him up so he need help so Apollo Creed helped him and he struggles to get it back So Rocky III is probably my second fav in this franchise it is up there or around there Creed and Rocky I love their chemistry at first you are like no way this would work and it does work so well which makes me not like rocky IV as much Clubber Lang as the challenger is good probably is up there to want of my fav challengers also some things I don't like is Thunderlips I don't like that fight only the end is good that is it from that all-round one of my fav in the franchise with great challenger and great chemistry from Rocky and Apollo so I give Rocky III a B+,Rocky III
110,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,"Eye of the Tiger - another great classic 80's best sequel in the Rocky saga, my second personal favorite movie of all time",10,2 October 2019,"Another classic the greatest sequel in the ""Rocky"" trilogy of the 80's. Rocky III come out the same year as ""First Blood"". It is a different third entry in the Rocky saga from the first two movies. It is in an Eye of the Tiger different style. After Sly completed Rocky II in 1979, Sly wrote a script for the third movie so that he completed the Rocky trilogy saga. Sylvester Stallone beautiful wrote a script, acted and directed. This was my third Rocky film of the five films I saw in the 90's. It is my number 2 favorite Rocky film of all time and I love this movie to death! Rocky III in my opinion is better than First Blood and it is my second personal favorite movie of all time.""Getting out while you can? Don't give this sucker no statue. Give him guts! I told you I wasn't going away. You got your shot, now give me mine.""This time Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) will have to face the most dangerous opponent ever, wild Clubber Lang (Mr. T). Rocky is at top of his game, he is still a heavyweight champion, he earns his money with making commercials, he is famous and defends his title 10 times. His life wouldn't get any better until black boxer Clubber Lang comes along and chalenges Rocky to a fight. He accepts the match, but his maneger Mickey (Burgess Meredith) tell's him that his old times are over. Rocky dosen't listen to him goes in a ring and loses his fight in 2 rounds and his maneger dies. But Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) comes out of retirement to help Rocky to beat the new champion once more and rise from the grace.Yes this is another best classic sequel in the Rocky franchise that I love to death! I watched this movie on VHS as a kid and I watch it over TV. I am huge fan of Rocky this was an a pair with Rocky IV. This movie has inspirational speach I would say this movie motiveted me more in life than the first movie. After Rocky loses his match against Clubber Lang his title and his maneger Mickey (Burgess Meredith) dies. Rock is dawn, but Apollo gives him hope and he motivated him: ""Look, man. When you beat me, I hurt all over. I didn't wanna know from nobody, not even my kids. Every fighter knows that hurt. We get sick inside trying to live with it, so don't back off now. Make it right for yourself or you'll be sorry you didn't."" You lost that fight for all the wrong reasons. You lost your edge. I know your manager dying had you all messed up inside. But the truth is you didn't look hungry. Now when we fought, you had that eye of the tiger, man, the edge. Now you gotta get it back, and the way to do it is to go back to the beginning. Maybe we could win it back together. Eye of the tiger, man.""The best of this sccreenplay Sly wrote is ""Make it right for yourself or you'll be sorry you didn't."" That's right you make mistake you have to fix it or you will be sorry you didn't. That's what this movie is about ""Fall and Rise from the bottom.""I love the training sequence, beautiful music score from Bill Conti. I love the opening logo of Rocky in opening sequence excellent. The second fight between Rocky and Clubber wasn't realistic boxers don't fight like that. That is why Rocky I and II succeed better. I love Rocky III to death it is my fourth favorite Rocky film. Carl Weathers as Apollo Creed did a great job acting his beloved character. Kudos to Carl when he helps Rocky and trains him to prepare against a fighter Rocky never fought before. I love the chemistry between Mick and Rocky they were a dream team. Burgess Meredith was excellent as Mickey. Mr. T was excellent as Clubber Lang, with all the candidates he got the part. When the movie was premiered Mr T whent watching this movie with his mom. Talia Shire as Adrian is a hot mama in this movie she is not shy anymore and she support Rocky in this movie while in Rocky II she did not support his decision. Hulk Hugan pro wrestler, actor, television personality also appears in this movie. It was his first movie Hogan playes Wrestler Thunderlips. Great choreography from Stallone even the boxing matches. You see Sly fighting more fighters than just one. I love the soundtrack Eye of the Tiger from Survivor the best movie of all time. I love the finale no one knows which hit first was it Rocky or Apollo.I don't have much to say, but I love this movie to death I love it, it is my childhood movie. Rocky III is a great classic 80's best sequel, it is my second personal favorite Rocky movie of all time. I miss Sylvester Stallone and his movies, he use to make in the 80's and 90's. I really wish Sly best with his new upcoming movies, his health and his life.",Rocky III
111,luke-a-mcgowan,Solid film with a new challenge for the character,6,2 January 2016,"In many ways, Rocky III gets back to what made the first film so great, whilst also straying further away from the classic formula. I'll just make an aside here to say that I don't understand why we need to replay the last scene of the preceding movie to open this movie. If I'm watching the third film of a franchise, I think its safe to say that I know how the previous ones went.The opening montages for Rocky III show us a lot about what Rocky has become and teaches us so much about the stratospheric rise of James ""Clubber"" Lang. Rocky poses for commercials while Clubber thrashes himself in his rigorous training schedule. Even the film's first fight is a flashy showcase for charity, featuring great entertainment value in watching Hulk Hogan and Sylvester Stallone face off. Whilst its cheap fun for us, what it says about Rocky makes it worthwhile as well. In the lead up to Clubber's battle with Rocky, Burgess Meredith's revulsion is the focal point for the audience who are also disgusted by how showy Rocky has become. The Rocky franchise has always excelled in contrasting the two boxers and their training, and seeing Clubber's simple but determined workout contrasted with Rocky's light punches in between photo ops speaks volumes about what is to come.Clubber Lang, played adequately by Mr. T, poses the exact challenge that Rocky as a character needed. When Clubber rages against Rocky's refusal to give him the shot that Rocky himself was given, it makes Clubber a deeper character than if he'd just been a brute with a haircut. Clubber wants to be the best, and its that which we remember even amongst his showy, bullying persona. He becomes a far less interesting character once he wins the title from Rocky as we see nothing about who he is or where he comes from like we did with the opponents in Rocky and Creed, but enough has been done that we're pumped for his defeat. The most memorable moment in Rocky 3 is the death of Micky, and this was a bold, confident and absolutely essential moment for the character of Rocky to proceed. Losing his title and his manager in one miserable evening, Rocky is broken down and can begin to rebuild, setting the stage for a movie without it feeling like a lazy rehash. The decision to place Paulie in Rocky's corner while the fight is going in was a brilliant move by Stallone, as Paulie is completely incapable of talking Rocky down and keeping him focused. The death scene, with a grieving Rocky howling over Micky's body is powerful.Apollo stepping in to train Rocky was a plot point I was very pleased to see and it had great potential at the start and paid off nicely, but the piece about Rocky's heart not being in it didn't feel right. It felt like it existed only to give Talia Shire something to do, because Adrian sits firmly in the background this time, a place she'll be for the rest of the franchise. Her concerns about Rocky's health completely evaporated - a fault of Rocky 2's inexplicable ending, rather than this film - her role mostly consists of reaction shots and tragically too- few sweet moments with Stallone. The speech she gives Rocky about getting his head in the game has some power to it, but it feels forced.Rocky 3's iconic Eye of the Tiger is a delight to listen to but I feel that it could have been better used throughout the Clubber fight rather than at the opening. The recurring point about Rocky's hunger was one that was touched on nicely throughout the film, and playing it when he finally gets it back (even at the expense of the gorgeous Bill Conti score) would have felt more appropritae.Overall, Rocky III is a solid film. It's got its flaws, but it's a new challenge for Rocky and a new direction for his character.",Rocky III
112,ReelCheese,Lacks The Rocky Feel,6,17 December 2006,"The original ROCKY and, to a lesser extent, ROCKY II, had a certain feel. You knew you were watching something special as the underdog of underdogs endeavored to bleed, sweat and punch his way to the impossible. You could relate to Rocky and da tings he was go-in chrew. He made you feel part of his experience.That sort of magic is absent in ROCKY III. It's not so much that Rocky has changed, though he has. When we first met him he was a nobody with nothing. In ROCKY II he was struggling to deal with being a somebody with lots of things. Though he tries to again make us believe he's a longshot, Stallone just can't pull it off this time because we know better. And it's not so much that the formula has changed, though it has. The first two films were not really boxing films at all, but human dramas we could all relate to whether we'd ever seen a punching bag or not. ROCKY III makes the mistake of being a boxing movie, largely pushing aside the human elements that made this character an icon.Well, actually, those factors probably do have something to do with it. As do the disappointing opening and closing matches. In the first, Rocky squares off against loud-mouthed wrestler Thunderlips (Hulk Hogan) in a charity bout. It ranks as the most embarrassing and bizarre occurrence of any ROCKY film as the Hulkster tosses Rock around and goes berserk. In the second, Rocky tries a new strategy of getting his opponent all worked up before delivering the finishing blows. The wonderful suspense of his first big fights are absent. Instead of standing up and cheering, we merely nod at the emergence of the obvious.Not that ROCKY III is an awful film. When critiqued on its own, forgetting thrills of the past, it certainly has worthwhile qualities. Stallone is good and honest as the hero, and Mr. T (in his film debut) is a treat as the over-the-top yet serious Clubber Lang. Rocky's use of his former rival, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), as his post-Mickey trainer is interesting, though of course the chemistry just isn't the same. And once again, the training sequences are inspiring.",Rocky III

Nowadays I think that without being the best one it has much more crumb than what is said, I see a pleasing Rocky a point of retiring, with money, health and an impeccable image. Suddenly a hungry boxer of titles appears whose obsession is to defeat Rocky humiliating him and in a moment what happened a fairy tale becomes a nightmare, losing one of the most important fights and the life of his charismatic coach at the time of his self-esteem and mastery of the situation. Rocky III, contains some of the best moments of the saga (the death of Mick, the two fights with Clubber a great and credible Mr. T, before starring in the TV series ""The A-Team"") and the background of the story tells us again the rise of Rocky from a new perspective.",Rocky III
116,jerekra,Shift In The Series.,9,16 January 2009,"Rocky 3 started a shift in the Rocky series. Instead of dealing with Rocky as an underdog trying to work his way up and establish himself, Rocky 3 has Rocky on top of the world.Rocky starts defending his title and knocks off ten different challengers. A new young vicious boxer, Clubber Lang, challenges Rocky. Mickey tells Rocky not to fight him because of the fact that Lang is a ""wrecking machine"" and that all of the people Rocky had beaten previously were nothing like him. Rocky fights him anyways, however tragedy hits prior to the fight and Rocky loses to Lang badly. Apollo Creed then decides to help Rocky train and regain the look he had when he had fought him.Rocky 3 is different in tone than the previous Rocky Films. Rocky himself acts much differently. As Mickey says Rocky becomes ""civilized"" and is not acting the role of the underdog who had to work hard to get what he wants. He is a millionaire heavyweight champion of the world, not a guy living in the slums of Philly who gets a chance to go against the heavyweight champion of the world. Rocky seems to be much more civilized and willing to converse in this film than he was in the other two. I can honestly say that I liked the Rocky from Rocky 1 and 2 better but it is interesting to see this change in character.Rocky 3 is an action packed film. Rocky gets in an exciting fight with Hulk Hogan at the beginning of the film for charity. Also Rocky fights against Clubber Lang TWICE in the ring. Rocky 3 has by far the most action of any of the Rocky Films.A few complaints. Number one I do not like the way that they killed off Mickey. I am not disappointed with the fact that Mickey dies, sometimes good characters die. I just do not like the way that he died. He gets pushed down by Lang and suffers heart failure. They could have killed him off in a different way that worked better.Another thing I did not get is how Rocky has the media circus surround him when he is training for his first fight against Lang. It is a complete circus and so unlike Rocky. Maybe this scene just was included to show how Rocky had changed and show how he is losing his edge but I still think it was out of place.Now for things I did like. I like the shift in character for Apollo Creed and how he helped Rocky to train. This is a perfect example of a bad guy becoming a good guy for the better, there are other times where this does not work. When Apollo decided to help Rocky out it completely surprised me and made me like Apollo better.This song has different music as well. Survivor's ""Eye of the Tiger"" is the main song of the film and really goes well with the theme of the film, Rocky getting back ""The Eye of the Tiger"". Overall this is one of the best songs in a movie ever, it just goes good with the film. When Rocky trains with Creed at the end they do play ""Gonna Fly Now"" but once again it is not the same version as used in the first Rocky film.So this is the most action packed of the Rocky Series, has a great shift in character for Apollo, and has a great theme song. It is not without its flaws but it is a lot of fun so it is worth seeing for that reason alone.",Rocky III
117,spasek,The Most Entertaining Rocky Film of the Series,9,8 September 2021,"Rocky III may not have the same level of character depth of the first two films, but it still has heart, and it still has the best boxing sequences--especially the last fight--of the series.Rocky is finally enjoying the high life of fame and fortune. No longer are he and Adrian struggling to scrape by. Even Adrian is doused in make-up, jewelry, and fine clothes.Rocky has been seemingly coasting through his ten title defenses until Rocky's most brutal challenger rises through the ranks in Clubber Lang. After insulting and baiting Rocky at his historic statue ceremony, Rocky wants to fight Lang. Mickey, however, refuses to help him.The love between Mickey and Rocky has always been the second best right behind Rocky and Adrian. Mickey is like a father-figure to Rocky, and when Rocky demands to know why Mickey refuses to help him, Mickey--though done out of love--makes the terrible mistake of telling Rocky that he can't win; that he's been protecting Rocky and ensuring that Rocky hasn't had to face any opponent who was too dangerous. Unfortunately, this saps Rocky of his confidence as well as instilling him with fear that he can't win in his rematch with Lang.The beauty of the Rocky/Adrian relationship is that Adrian is his pillar of strength. When she's in his corner, Rocky can pull off the miraculous. And if anyone can help restore Rocky's confidence, it's Adrian. The most iconic scene of the entire movie is Adrian confronting Rocky on the beach, pressing and pushing him to confess that he's scared, but also letting him know that it's okay to be scared, for he's never been anything less to her in her eyes. But, she wisely also tells him that if he's going to fight, he has to do it for himself and not for anyone else.This is the only film that shows the entire final fight from start to finish, and it doesn't disappoint. For the first time, we actually see Rocky look like a boxer; look like Sugar Ray or Ali, dancing, punching, and moving. Of course, he'll forget all of this by the time the next film comes around, but for this film, it's virtual artistry in motion. Of all of the characters to showcase some actual boxing prowess, only Creed comes close. That is, until this film.This is also my favorite Apollo Creed--and Carl Weathers has said the same--where he helps Rocky restore what he's lost, with a fairly humorous ""favor"" to be paid back at the end of the film.For me, the first two Rocky films were gold as Stallone continued to help us explore Balboa and his relationship with Adrian. As many have said, ""Rocky"" and even ""Rocky II"" to some degree, are love films that take place within the realm of boxing. ""Rocky III"" is actually more of a boxing film than its predecessors, and perhaps that is also why it's the most entertaining of the three.",Rocky III

As with ""Rocky II,"" the gang's all here with all the major players from the previous film in tow as well as a couple of memorable newcomers in Mr. T and Hulk Hogan.Opening with a montage set to Survivor's ""Eye of the Tiger"" (written specifically for use in the film) all of the necessary exposition one would need with this film is provided quickly enough so that the film can get underway with its quickly-paced, action packed and drama fueled plot. Following the events of the previous film, Rocky Balboa is riding high on success, raising his son and living the good life in the lush mansion he shares with his wife, Adrian. On the day he is rewarded with a statue erected in his honor and announces his retirement, he is challenged by a vicious newcomer, Clubber Lang (Mr. T), who quickly gives our hero a run for his money which in turn has him training with an unlikely new ally: Apollo Creed.No doubt, the film is lacking some of the substance of the previous films, but three films into a franchise, it's only natural. Thankfully, ""Rocky III"" is entertaining enough that it doesn't wear out its welcome. From the colorful characters portrayed by both Mr. T and Hulk Hogan (who would each go on to become icons of the 80's in their own right) to the continuing saga of our main character and his newfound camaraderie with his previous enemy, there's enough juice in the film's tank to keep it running until the end. Fans of the original and even its sequel will notice a significant step-down in quality, yet, it's still a film that's hard not to enjoy.",Rocky III
121,L_Copa,"Wow, Sylvester Stallone never lets down at Rocky!",10,30 March 2020,"Once again Sylvester Stallone took directing , writing and casting on his shoulders and managed to deliver an amazing sequel! One of the most famous soundtracks that motivated many generations accompanied with the best training from the 80's and the funniest and toughest fights ,gave us an amazing entertainment. Mr T and Hulk Hogan is far , the best pick for Rocky's opponents that really stood up against him! The whole concept contender against the champion is smart and the script was evolved nicely around it , by bringing Apollo back to the script!",Rocky III
122,David_Frames,Hit me baby one more time,5,6 June 2005,"And so to the third Rocky in which a complacent Stallone has grown fat on opulence and celebrity and finds himself unprepared for the hungry and you'd have to say insane challenger, Clubber Lang, none other than Mr.T in the first role of a surprisingly undistinguished movie career. Rocky's beaten naturally because his cheque book isn't quite strong enough to cushion Lang's punches and even worse, Lang has roughed up trainer Mickey and caused him to have a fatal heart attack. Such setbacks would dampen the spirits of lesser men and sure enough Balboa slips into a depression and something of an existential crisis. Thankgoodness then for old adversary, turned friend Apollo Creed who tells Rocky to pick himself up, read up on Tigers and take himself to the beach for a bit of homo-erotic horseplay, then on to the ring to teach the new champ a damn good lesson...Rocky III may be a comment on the promise of the American ideal corrupted by its vast wealth and unrestrained capitalism. Then again that could be nonsense. In Rocky you've got the embodiment of the American dream gone soft and no longer possessing the spirit that was the source of his power and influence. He's reduced to commercial endorsements and expensive suites and even more embarrassingly, Wrestling Exibition fights. He's lost his heart and his self-respect, y'know the kind you only have when you're poor and he needs to get it back because at this point there's still an hour of the film left. The third film is a bit of a weird one because though perfectly watchable its got moments of supreme silliness. All of a sudden Rocky can't get anywhere near a ring without oiling himself up. Creed seems obsessed with the tie-in track and mentions it every five minutes and we learn that the only way to get your respect back is to do imitations of wild animals and jump about in the sand with the spray of the ocean suggestively foaming all over you. We're left with this rather strange situation in which the film is softened by the same commerical pressures that Rocky himself proved susceptible too. It's Rocky now as franchise - product and as a result there's none of the dramatic pretencions of early movies. It's strictly formula which is fine but it might leave you wondering where the series could go after this. Well Russia of course!",Rocky III
123,Slarkshark,Eye of the Tiger,8,15 February 2021,"The first 'Rocky' to be a straight up boxing movie. The first two contained much more drama, whereas this one has three full fights and the rest is essentially training. I thought this was better than 'Rocky ll' as it wasn't just a rehash of the first.In the film it's easy to see that Rocky falls prey to complacency due to being a celebrity and world champ. Little did he know he was being coddled. Then he meets the hungry Clubber Lang who Mick warns will knock Rock into tomorrow! Lang could easily be the most despised foe of the 'Rocky' franchise and Mr. T was so good as him. I loved seeing Apollo Creed transition into the trainer, and taking Rocky to Los Angeles to train. The whole fight to regain the eye of the tiger was great. Those beach sprinting scenes are iconic.I'm always surprised how short the final fight is, but again something different than the first two. The final scene with Rocky and Apollo might be the best of the whole film though, at least for me.",Rocky III
124,aura772,The Excitement... The Power... The Man...,10,18 April 2007,"""Rocky III"" isn't just about the way a fighter wins his title back. It's about a man that believes in himself, it's about hope and honesty with yourself.There's more into the Rocky series then an underdog story... it's about a man and his life's story. It's about the power of trust... because Rocky believed in himself first of all, he knew that he was a great in what he was doing and he impressed the hole world with that.Apollo's help meant in a symbolic way, that in life, there will always be someone else to believe in you. Even someone you thought to be your challenger. And of course there's his wife that will be with him no matter what.I believe that the Rocky movies are about a man that's showing the world, being poor is not a problem... being gifted it is... :))",Rocky III
125,nims-1975,Filled with awesome and powerful action,9,1 September 2018,"Rocky III is an awesome film which has excellent acting by Sylvester Stallone as Rocky, Talia Shire as Adrian, Burt Young as Paulie, Carl Weathers as Apollo Creed, Mr. T as Clubber lang and Hulk Hogan as Thunderlips. This film is much better than Rocky IV because it doesn't lack things which Rocky IV does. Rocky III is a very brutal film with awesome action. Rockys opponent the very brutal and ferocious Clubber Lang(played by Mr. T) has a lot of hate for Rocky and thinks too much of himself and thinks that he's the only champion boxer and that Rocky is a wimp. When asked by people who Interview Clubber Lang what's he going to do to Rocky, Clubber Lang says things such as ''Destroy him'', ''Kill Him'' and loads of other things showing his hate for Rocky. He also is a very big headed, boastful, loud, arrogant, aggressive and rude boxer and is very disrespectful when around other people threatening them and also telling them to ''Shut Up''. Clubber Langs fighting in this film is much more better than Ivan Dragos from Rocky IV. Clubber Langs punches are fast, brutal and very powerful and he is a killer in the ring when fighting. Also in this film Mr. T is awesome as Clubber Lang a great adversary for Rocky and the power and the physical and verbal anger and hatred his character displays in the ring towards Rocky is full of intensity and is just awesome. You didn't get this from Ivan Drago in Rocky IV and Clubber really knows how to express his thoughts, opinions and feelings towards Rocky excellently. Rocky III is a very intense film and that's what I absolutely love about this film compared to Rocky IV. Rocky IV is a bit intense but not as intense as Rocky III. The first Rocky film is the best but Rocky III is a film which beats a lot of the other Rocky films and is much more better than them. Films such as Rocky II, Rocky IV, Rocky V etc are no way as good or better than Rocky III. Rocky III is filled with awesome and powerful action and lots of more great things. When getting the correct training from Apollo Creed after getting knocked out by the dangerous Clubber Lang, Apollo wants Rocky to have the faith in himself as boxer and gives Rocky the proper training before Rocky goes in for a rematch against Clubber Lang. Again in the rematch you see Clubber Langs fast, brutal and very powerful punches which are awesome, but when Rocky tells Clubber to knock him out and blocks the punches that Rocky gets, the film gets even better and then Rocky starts doing some very powerful punches on Clubber Lang and eventually knocking out Clubber and winning the match. Rocky III is really a film that I think is absolutely awesome and I definitely will watch it again. This film is definitely what I would say as being the 2nd best Rocky film in the Rocky film series and deserves higher than 6.8/10. I give this film 9.7/10.",Rocky III
126,vailsy,probably the second best Rocky after the first one,7,24 December 2011,"Rocky 3 has a lot going for it in terms of characters - we have Mr T, Hulk Hogan, Rocky and Apollo Creed all in one story and at times it feels like a superhero movie, in a good way The moral of the story is actually a very good one and is relevant to many people's lives at some stage.. we lose our way and need to find it again, perhaps with help and come back stronger than before Rocky has to dig deep and go back to his roots, and back to the sweat and tears to rediscover the 'Eye of the Tiger' in order to match his opponent Clubber Lang in grit and hunger. To do this he returns to the streets and learns some new skills from ex-champ and mentor Apollo Creed Somehow, cut down muscle tops, short shorts, and long socks, sometimes headbands, are acceptable in the ghetto and this culminates in some very shady scenes with Rocky and Apollo jumping and hugging each other on the beach in slow motion Also Stallone takes a hammer and chisel to Burgess Meredith's (Mick's) greatest acting moment on his death bed with some really stupid vocals which only Stallone knows how to makeBut otherwise this is a rock solid movie and very entertaining For those interested it has some unexpectedly good sound design features. Some really varied game-like slo-mo heavy hits from Clubber and Thunderlips. Also the death rattle as Mick expires his last breath is very nicely done Overall, recommended",Rocky III
127,blacklist-1,"Disappointing compared to the first two, but still entertaining showing Rocky hasn't run out of steam yet.",6,8 September 2010,"Rocky III starts of tremendously with a marvellous montage of where Rocky II left with his rematch fight with Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) as Rocky (Stallone) has become the heavyweight champion of the world. The montage shows Rocky with his career growing over five years as we see him defending his title ten times undefeated. Cut to his new life. He and his wife Adrian and along with there son have moved to an even bigger house with Rocky suddenly maturing (wearing suits). He is enjoying the high-life. He decides to retire but new boxer climbing through the ranks Clubber Lang (Mr.T) challenges Rocky to defend his title, he agrees after Clubber taunts him, but he loses his title as his coach Mickey dies of a heart attack (Buregess Meredith). Rocky feels he has a lost apart of himself but with help from an unexpected friend Creed trains Rocky to reclaim his title from Lang.This is an entertaining third movie in the series and is about twenty minutes shorter. The tone of the third has changed from the first two. Rocky III now just concentrates on more the boxing and as a result Talia Shire as Adrian (whilst her acting is still good and she looks better than ever) her role is severely reduced where she now just appears in most scenes without talking. Though on the beach she gives her husband a passionate speech. Also Rocky Junior dosen't get much screen time, so you don't feel a bond between the family and as a result you lose the most of the touching and heartwarming moments that were apparent in the first two and that is where I felt Rocky III went wrong. Also the story isn't much different and it's started to feel slightly repetitive with the script feeling old-school now.However Stallone delivers a great performance again and so does Burgess Meredith in his unfortunately last appearance as Micky with a heartbreaking moment when he passes away. Mr. T as Clubber Lang makes a fearsome challenge with a delightful evil performance by him. One thing I did like was that Carl Weathers as Creed (who plays his part well) has a bigger role in this one. You see him and Rocky start to bond as they become friends and that was nice to see. The end fight was well done and entertaining but it wasn't as exciting or inspirational as the first two. However Rocky III is an impressive instalment for a third movie and hopefully the fourth in the series can do just as well or better.",Rocky III
128,LuboLarsson,Great Entertainment,9,28 April 2002,"Rocky III is great entertainment. Its less serious than the previous two, as Sylvester Stallone packs as much action as he can into its running time. This time Rocky is defeated in the ring by Clubber Lang played by Mr T who went onto greater fame in TV's The A team and Rocky has to get ""The Eye of the Tiger"" back to take him on again in a rematch. Without his beloved trainer Mickey who dies of a heart attack in a touching scene in his dressing room after his defeat. Appollo Creed now trains Rocky in an interesting twist as they were opponents in the first two films. This leads to the usual training sequence and massive fight at the end of the film. All in all a great film and a massive hit when it was released in 1982. It also contains the No 1 hit ""Eye of the Tiger"" by Survivor. A great Rocky film, and in my opinion it was even bettered by the next Rocky film, Rocky IV of course!",Rocky III

130,cosmorados,Arguably the second best Rocky film,8,30 December 2007,"You know, when I was a kid growing up this was actually my favourite Rocky film. Now as time's gone by and I'm older and wiser, it is of course the original which stands apart from the others. The symbolism and meaning that old all the plaudits are in the first film, but this one is still my next favourite. This film has Rocky as a successful heavyweight champ whose world comes crashing down when he finds out that his subsequent title defences weren't what he thought they were. Faced with a viscous challenger Rocky has to come to terms with facing his own fear of losing everything he's worked hard to build and remember exactly what it was that made him everyone's favourite underdog.True it is not in the league of dramatic brilliance of the first film and it is corny as hell, but that takes nothing away from one simple truth and that is that this film is fun. From the moment of the opening montage or Rocky's successful title defences through to the end painting of Apollo and Rock in the ring it's a rip-roaring enjoyable punch fest and the truth is that there's nothing wrong with that. I, like a lot of people thought little of this film due to Rocky 4 and 5, but what I would say is treat this as it should be treated, as the third part of the first Rocky Trilogy.Fantastic!",Rocky III

Who didn't love that??The opponent was pretty tough for rocky to beat but he will beat because he is ""Rocky Balboa"" It falls short from its prequels because it is not concentrated on feeling emotion attachments and all its just focused on boxing and thats why I give it 7/10.But its still good because of its boxing scenes and a last fight for over 12 bells!!!!

133,Caleb_Everett,A Classic.,7,2 January 2019,"Rocky III, aka, Mr. T party. I love the Rocky series and I truly believe that Sylvester Stallone gets overlooked as an actor because of some of the cheesy (b) movies he did as an actor, but in this series, he really gets the opportunity to show his acting chops. This one definitely doesn't have the same vigor or gusto as the previous two, but his foe is definitely more formidable. They made more of the emphasis on fighting in this one, which I do think almost tarnishes the story arc built so well from the previous films. This movies shining moment though is when Rocky and Adrian are standing on the beach and Rocky breaks down to Adrian that he's afraid. Truly a powerful moment in an otherwise overly macho movie. Would/Will watch again.",Rocky III
134,KeremUlucay,ANOTHER BALBOA ADVENTURE,7,29 December 2018,"Rocky III has incredibly great things like watching Rocky different situations and moods, his relationship with his son, he proves to whole world he is smarter than people think. Mickey and Adrian characters have key roles in story. And Creed's motivation is great. Seeing Creed and Balboa together is great too. In the other hand it has big mistakes. Come on, what is Clubber Lang trying to do? What he wants and why? What is this hate? These are meaningless. After Apollo, he is not competitor I expected. Press conference sequence has so stupidly written. After all, every fight scene is amazing. Listening Eye of Tiger is fun and it has an effect on story. But finally Rocky III is weaker than first and second movie. Because it hasn't got something powerful in main idea.",Rocky III
135,T-ZER0,"In my opinion, the best Rocky film.",10,28 May 2019,"Rocky III is the one film that injected new life into the franchise with a great new story, amazing music and an entertaining cast.Most people think that Rocky IV is the best, and while that one did have its moments. This one to me will always be superior. This movie introduced Mr. T as Clubber Lang, my favorite Rocky villain. To me he was more of a threat than Drago. He was loud, intimidating and could knock Rocky down instantly. Which is why I found it amazing that Apollo Creed himself helped Rocky train to take him down. I thought it was very creative on Sylvester Stallone's part to add that on the script. It really influenced the ""Eye of the Tiger"" part of the story.What I noticed about this movie that most people didn't see, was that (SPOILERS FOR ROCKY IV!!) while Drago killed Apollo in the fourth film, Clubber was mostly responsible for Mickey's heart attack, which is why I think he is just as scary as Drago. One more thing about Clubber, he didn't use drugs like Drago and was still strong.I really liked how this film made Rocky and Apollo friends, because it showed how Rocky always had respect for him and that Apollo was never a villain like everyone thought he was in the first two films. This movie deserves a ten!!",Rocky III

137,sammielimehouse-84658,"A Frustrating, but Watchable Film",7,8 August 2021,"I seem to dislike this film more and more every single time I watch it. I think that's because of Rocky as a character. In this movie he acts so out of character; in the first two films Rocky's this normal, nice guy who isn't the brightest but has the heart to make it in the boxing business, but in this movie, he's much smarter than the Rocky character was before. And I've heard some people say that money turned him this way, which is I guess a good enough explanation because he was only like this in this film and Rocky IV. That aside, the fighting in this movie was improved, the cast was still great, and the score was still fantastic.7.4/10.",Rocky III

Stallone is good here, the training sequences steal the show (as always), and Mr. T's role as Clubber is not bad, but the story becomes predictable by halfway.

Mr. T as clubber Lang plays a vicious boxer who is almost a sadist in the boxing ring and he temps Rocky out of retirement to fight him. There are of course the corny Rocky moments we have become use to with the soundtrack rock music playing with Rocky training in the old gym. Anyway, Rocky does come back and fights Clubber Lang and takes a punch that under normal conditions would kill a human being. But hey Rocky is used to getting hit a lot as he always allows himself to. In any case Rocky is approached by Apollo Creed and is told he lacks the eye of the tiger and offers to train him....Yawn.

Now with the help of Apollo Creed, Rocky challenges Lang for a rematch for the belt, can he win it all again? Sly returns in this second sequel to the smash boxing hit Rocky. This film is not as good as the first two but it proves to be a really entertaining film with the lust of winning and gaining back the eye of the tiger. Mr. T gives a great performance as the killing machine Clubber Lang. Sadly, Burgess Meredith must act as his character Micky passes away in this chapter. But this is a good subplot for when Apollo Creed steps up and helps Rocky train for his fight with Clubber, making the two good friends. This film though, it's worn down from the past two with Rocky now a big star. Though not perfect, this film gives great performances. One may I say is the big brawl between Rocky and Hulk Hogans Thunderlips for charity and it's great! So if you like the first two movies, you'll appreciate Rocky III.

It's not a terrible movie. You get what you've already come to expect from Rocky movies- good action, Rocky's ongoing conflicts and also a little more insight into Apollo Creed who was always one of the most interesting characters in the series. The only problem here is that Rocky III just screams ""80s movie"" louder than anything you've ever seen- with juiced up bodies, oily training montages and Eye of the Tiger kicking in all over the place.

He was swept up by all the fame and all the changes fame makes, More money bigger house more people knowing who you are. It feeds the Ego.

But in the meantime he destroys his way to the top. undefeated. and angry he confronts Rocky at a Civic unveiling of a statue honoring Rocky. angry Rocky accepts and Gives Clubber his shot. but Mickey mysteriously walks away. Leaving Rocky hurt and angry. Once they are home he confronts Mickey who tells him the truth. the beating that Apollo gave him should have killed him. Anymore fights of that type would have. So Mickey working behind the scenes found good strong fighters. fighters that would give Rocky a good fight but not devastate him like clubber. Rocky is crushed. Those ten title defenses he believes are fake set ups just to keep the Title Longer. Rocky begs Mickey to train him .Mickey agrees. Rocky trains poorly. clubber Trains Hard and on the day of the fight two things happen that'll impact Rocky forever. The first is during a brawl between both fighters on route to the ring. Mickey suffers a heart attack and dies. And Apollo Creed while being a guest of honor is treated like trash by Clubber. Clubber destroys Rocky, And the Championship becomes Clubber Lang's.

Rocky II was about not forgetting about what's the most important things in life are. while pursuing your dreams. Rocky III it's point is simple. Never forget who you are and never lose yourself in superficial things be honest to yourself at least.Stallone once said that Rocky III was about how fame changed him. and how people had changed around him it was as Stallone said very surreal. Like Alice falling down the Rabbit hole into Wonderland .And he captures that perfectly here. Creating a classic Rocky film that can easily take its place among the best.

144,KillerLord,"Come on, hit me harder! Ain't so bad! Ain't so Bad!",7,3 February 2007,"Rocky 1 and Rocky 2 together were a nice coherent story. So when I heard of Rocky 3 I seriously did not know what precisely to expect. What would be the story line? What aspect of Rocky's life was to be explored now? Rocky 3 portrays a possible problem a boxer might face after his career reaches the peak. As Micky puts it, the boxer gets ""civlized"". Rocky has achieved all fame and name and not to mention a lot of money. He has changed his lifestyle completely much to the disapproval and dismay of his wife and trainer cum friend Micky. His training becomes less intense and over-confidence takes over him after a streak of wins. He does remain the kind hearted and humble man that we have seen him as. This change in Rocky's life and perspective is a possible reference to Apollo's life as well. Apollo too was shown to be over-confident and over-relaxed in the first part of Rocky series.In the meantime, we see emerging, another vicious, brutal boxer Clubber Lang. Clubber Lang clearly has one advantage on his side. His training is mean and vicious. And he is rising up...fast! So when Clubber Lang and Rocky are scheduled to meet in the ring we see the difference in the training styles of both boxers. One can clearly feel the tinge that Rocky is going to lose and he does. With Micky suffering a heart stroke, Rocky under-prepared and over-confident gets a beating from Lang and loses in the second round by KO. With Micky dead and Rocky's confidence and pride totally shattered, Apollo now offers to help Rocky train once again for a rematch. Apollo however teaches Rocky to be faster and more agile. Now make a careful comparison between Stallone's fighting method as Rocky in the first two movies. He did not move fast but gave intense punches and almost had a street brawl. This is of course the reason why the decision goes in favor of Apollo in the first part for Apollo had been able to land way more punches and jabs on Rocky. And now see the way he fights in the third installment against Lang. He moves faster, has a very good footwork, excellent dodging capability and has more stamina. I have to appreciate Stallone for having trained hard to show this new ability of Rocky's. The movie does get a little off the track when we see the fight between Hogan (as Thunderlips) and Rocky. The training scenes are very good but still there is something absent that was present in the first two movies. It is difficult to describe what exactly seems to be missing. The movie tries to tell that one should not let success get into their heads. It also shows an emerging friendship based on mutual admiration and respect between Apollo and Rocky.And I believe that a write-up on Rocky 3 is incomplete without Rocky 3's soundtrack ""Eye of the Tiger"" by Survivor. Was possibly a song with the best lyrics to suit a boxing movie. The soundtrack covers up a lot for the very slightly reduced luster of the Rocky saga.In the end, I'll say it is a well done movie and not bad at all!

For what may be the most exciting and most fast-paced film in the series. Sylvester Stallone writes, directs and acts with explosive passion and intensity. As Rocky Balboa fights his way into the hearts of millions, life couldn't be better. He scores ten consecutive wins, lands lucrative endorsement contracts, and becomes famous throughout the world. But when Clubber Lang K.O.s Rocky in an humiliating defeat, it becomes apparent that the ""Italian Stallion"" has lost his edge. Considering hanging up his gloves, Rocky receives encouragement from an unlikely ally: his old nemesis, Apollo Creed. With Creed's help Rocky strives to retain the ""eye of the tiger"" before confronting Clubber Land in a rematch and to try and win back the title.This film starred: Sylvester Stallone, Carl Weathers & Mr.T also featuring Talia Shire, Burt Young and Burgess Meredith.In my opinion this is not only the best Rocky film but one of the best films ever made. I just love every thing about this film from the first minute to the last and the fight with Clubber at the end, when Rocky retains the title it's just amazing the whole of the final fight is just amazing with the quote as it is in my summary ""come on champ you ain't so bad"" just proves how hard Rocky wants the title!*****/***** Outstanding",Rocky III
146,Jsimpson5,A good sequel,7,9 March 2007,"This movie is the third installment in the Rocky Series. This movie takes place sometime after the second movie. Basically the film starts out by giving a recap of the previous movie, so in this case, it's recapping Rocky winning the world championship from Apollo. Now Rocky is a huge celebrity, and wants to retire from boxing, but an up and coming fighter wants to fight Rocky to prove to the world that Rocky is a push over.There are sad parts in this film, mainly when Mick passes away and when Rocky loses the title. The acting is this movie is top notch as always and the script is well written. The only script part that I have a problem with is Rocky's incoherent rant right after Mick dies.Overall this is a good film to watch and if you like the Rocky movies, then this is a must see.",Rocky III
147,asd29,Good but sloppy at the same time.,7,9 February 2021,"Like its number in the series this second sequel is in my opinion the THIRD best in the saga, better than 4, 5 and rocky balboa, i dont count CREED 1&2 against the original six films as the films are spin offs and very belated, This movie brings in new characters including MR T (clubber lang) and HULK HOGAN (thunderlips) as rockys opponents which makes this sequel an exciting spectacle but the end result is quite sloppy and over the top and really undermines the reality of boxing , Rocky (after winning the world heavyweight championship from Appollo creed in part 2 )becomes rich and famous and overcome ten title defences , meanwhile there is a new challenger in the midst james CLUBBER lang an brutal hungry fighter gunning for balboas title, clubber challenges rocky to mickeys disaproval because his old trainer thinks rocky is too civalised and not as hungry now hes achieved his ultimate goal, the champion persuades mickey for one last fight, After not training hard enough for the fight rocky loses his title to lang in a one sided fight ,during this mickey collapses and dies, a respectful appollo creed decides to train a humbled and scared ex champion to win the title back in the inevitable rematch.The fight sequences in this entry are over played and not plausible and probably the worst choreography in the whole franchise, its like watching two video game characters, but the film is on the same tone of the first two movies and stallone, talia shire , burt young, carl weathers and burgess meredith reprise thier roles well , MR T does ok as a novice actor and nearly steals the show , this movie had the potential to be the best in the series,- its exciting , emotional ,and action packed with a great music soundtrack but the choreography and script wears thin compared to the previous two movies , its a worthy entry in the franchise but it easily could have been better (but most films are not perfect) 7/10",Rocky III

150,dean2900,Favorite Rocky Film? YES Best:? NO,8,16 December 2006,"Do NOT read this review if you have not seen Rocky III. This is more for people who are considering re watching it after many years.I don't think many people will argue that the original Rocky was the best made movie of the series. Keep in mind I have not seen Rocky Balboa yet so I am basing my opinion on Rocky 1 - 5.I don't even care much for Sly but his role in Rocky I was perfect for him as he was completely believable as the semi bum Italian boxer who was tougher tan nails in the ring.Rocky II was the movie everyone wanted because they wanted to see Rocky not just survive but WIN the championship.Rocky III has the most entertainment value to me because we already know the characters, we know the love story, we know Apollo Creed, Pauly, and Mickey.Rocky gets soft fighting has beens for easy money and starts to get a big head.Mr T making his first appearance on the big screen played the role of the young hungry fighter perfectly IMO. He was strong, vicious, fought dirty, and wanted the championship more than anything else on earth. Rocky had sense lost the desire.Micky tell Rocky he wont be a part of this fight because ""This guy will knock you into tomorrow"" as only the great Burgess Meredith could say it.Rocky prepares lightly for the first fight with the mighty Clubber Lang and Mickey dies during the first fight after a mêlée ensues before the fight between the Rocky and Clubber Lang Camps.Rocky gets destroyed by Clubber.Rocky is depressed, feels like he has lost his meaning in life, and sees no hope. Apollo Creed comes to the rescue with the famous ""Eye of the Tiger"" speech and the popular pop song is played during the movie in place of the ""working hard"" to make it more distinctly feel like an 80s movie as compared to its predecessors.As I am sure you know, Rocky wears Clubber Lang down in the rematch and knocks him out in the third round.The reason this is my favorite is the combination of the fact that I already liked the characters, Apollo's character is expanded on, and this movie is almost all action. It starts off with scenes from the Rocky II Apollo Creed rematch and then goes to scenes of him fighting lesser fighters. In between it switches to Clubber Lang knocking out fighters in a much more vicious manner and moving up the ranks. Rocky III even throws ins a charity match between Rocky and Hulk Hogan as an exhibition between a wrestler and a boxer. After Apollo and Adrian (Yo Adrian) gets Rocky of of his funk, it quickly goes through Rocky getting the eye of the tiger back and then quickly moves to the rematch with Clubber Lang. I don't think there was anyone who saw this movie who had any doubt he would lose the rematch.The ensuing Rocky IV and V were very bad especially 5. I recommend Rocky III as great fun one night for another viewing on DVD of course.At this point, the initial reviews for Rocky Balboa (Rocky 6) are looking positive. I laughed when I heard it was made but I am know looking forward to hopefully the final chapter in the Rocky Saga.",Rocky III

152,joliet-jake,One of my favorites from the series,9,16 December 2004,With part three we see rocky after he has become heavy weight champion. We also see that Mr T wants to box him for the title. There are a couple things that happen but i don't want to ruin the movie for you. i think that this one is very good it is in second place for me with parts 1 and 4 in first. If you have so far liked the series you will definitely like this one. Los of action with lots of drama in it. Go ahead and see this one you will enjoy it. All of the character are played with grace and style. If you want to see a very good drama slash action movie this one is great and you will greatly enjoy it. This movie gets nine out of ten possible starts strongly recommended.,Rocky III
153,amraampk,"live like tiger,fight like tiger, rise like tiger ITS THE EYE OF THE TIGER",10,12 March 2009,"WARNING:SOME LITTLE SPOILERS.In my very 1st comment about rocky balboa i talked about how rocky was introduced in my life through an April fool day, this was the movie. At that young as an 8 yrs old , i understood the myth and the ideology of this film. That was the 1st time i saw sly Stallone, and in its 1st appearance he made his place in my heart. When he become too much indulged in the business of money making and fame ,he ignored the advice of his mentor mickey and the fact that he is losing his attitude of being a true fighter, than he is met by clubber lang , a new but vicious , arrogant and aggressive contender and he knocks rocky out easily in second round just like without a fight , also then mickey is gone forever. Rocky is so devastated and broken down he even now despises his own self. So much frustrated at this time that he cant put it out of his mind what happened and what is left for him to live than now he is offered a selfless and generous assistance by an unlikely ally. His old nemesis Apollo creed. Now being Apollo on his side all rocky has to do to put himself all together and again live for the glory and prestige he lost in the ring with that championship, Coz that the the only way he can live with his own self, by following the phenomena Apollo creed introduced to him as the eye of the tiger. This was the best movie as far boosting your morale and spirit in the whole rocky series. Mr T as clubber lang was an excellent discovery by Sylvester Stallone, as here he also proved his directional skills , also as he discovered Dolph lundgren for rocky 4. Another good thing was a wrestling match with than champion wrestler Hulk hogan by Rocky balboa. This movie is very very gripping from the start till the end rematch, especially the song eye of the tiger , it is still very much favorite among me and my brothers, cousins and friends. I call it an all time film, forever flick.",Rocky III
154,fullonrobotchubby,Bring on the 80's!,7,15 August 2006,"In this third installment of the franchise started by the winner of the 1976 Academy Award for Best Picture, the Eighties rushes in like a tidal wave. Lucky for us, the Balboa gang is already hip to the decade - just don't take it seriously, that's the key. Honestly, if you want a good reminiscent chuckle of the Rubik's cube era but still want to be entertained, it's hard to beat Rocky III. The film has everything Eighties: the montage, the brightly colored clothes, Hulk Hogan playing a character named Thunderlips... The two main sources of Eighties power? The introduction of Survivor's musical Van Gogh ""Eye of the Tiger"" and Rocky's opponent Clubber Lang, played by none other than Mr. T. My favorite scene is without a doubt the montage of the two fighters getting fit for the match (Balboa and new manager Apollo Creed running on the beach, Clubber doing chin-ups in a dungeon, etc.). Enough jibba-jabba; see Rocky III.",Rocky III
155,vav-61764,Rocky III is Good But Its Essence is Missing,6,1 December 2015,"Even though this is a boxing movie, what made its two predecessors stand out were the well constructed characters and a story that harmonized the fights with the dramatic moments. Rocky III leaves much to be desired in this aspect, even if some quite meaningful and emotional events happen. A story has some subplots but they are either wrapped-up quickly or poorly explored. The fights are very exciting, the technical aspects, such as shooting or choreography, are good, but they didn't put me on the edge of my seat. Adrian played by Talia Shire doesn't have such a strong presence as in the previous movies, her few scenes with Rocky, Sylvester Stallone, are enjoyable, specially one that she sees the need to make Rocky understand himself and recognize what he's feeling.Clubber Lang performed by Mr. Tis not a great and mesmerizing antagonist, he transmits so much hatred that in the end it becomes excessive, it seems that he drank a whole bottle of coffee with a red bull pack, because I had the impression that he would explode anytime. Burt Young is Paulie, this character isn't emphatically developed, but his scenes bring a little of comic relief due to his sarcastic humor and complicated personality. Rocky and Mickey, Burgess Meredith, behind all their arguments, there's relation of love and care, like a father and son. An interesting and positive situation was the course taken in the relation between Rocky and Apollo Creed played by Carl Weathers. The soundtrack is almost the same but has some good and remarkable inclusions. It's amazing that even though in the third film, the training scene follows the same molds from the previous but still is incredibly awesome.",Rocky III

Rocky fights him and loses because his manager Micky dies (Almost Cried) But something surprising happens! A new manager comes up. Guess who he is... It's Apollo Creed. He gets rocky to know the eye of the tiger and he learns a new style of boxing. He doesn't do left hooks anymore... He uses his right hand now. So he fights the challenger and he kicks his ass.

158,phantopp,"Almost loses ""The Eye of the Tiger"" half-way through",6,27 July 2009,"""Rocky Balboa"" (Sylvester Stallone, who also wrote and directed the movie), the Professional Boxing World Heavyweight Champion, is living the life he sought. He lives in a huge house with his family, has been on the cover of various magazines and has numerous endorsement deals. However, unknown to him, he has gotten soft inside the ring to the point where his manager, ""Mickey"" (Burgess Meredith) booked him in bouts with inferior fighters. Even getting in the ring with the cocky professional wrestling star, ""Thunderlips"" (Hulk Hogan in his acting debut).He lost his edge, and ""Mickey"" knew it. However, the champ wouldn't believe it. He even went against ""Mickey's"" orders, and accepted the challenge of ""Clubber Lang"" (Mr. T in one of his most famous roles), a tough, bad attitude boxer who rapidly reached the Number One Contendership by himself with no trainer helping him out.""Mickey"" warned ""Balboa"" not to accept ""Lang's challenge, but the mohawked fighter verbally went after the champ's wife (Talia Shire) at a public appearance. He immediately accepted the challenge. However, ""Mickey"" was proved right, and ""Balboa"" lost the title to ""Lang."" And, to make things worse, ""Mickey"" suffers a heart attack backstage during a confrontation between ""Balboa"" and ""Lang"", and dies in the dressing room as ""Lang"" easily defeats the champion for the title.Now, ""Balboa"" has to regain what he once had. And he gets help from an old rival (Carl Weathers). A rival who once saw the ""Eye of the Tiger"" when he fought ""The Italian Stallion"" himself for the title.This is one slow moving movie, especially about half-way through the film. I saw myself looking at websites around that time more than watching the film on On Demand. It does pick up leading up to the rematch between the two boxing rivals around the time ""Apollo Creed"" shows up.The acting is near perfect all around. You knew almost immediately when ""Balboa"" admits that he lost his edge, by Stallone's performance in the scene, that the death of ""Mickey"" affected him deeply. Certain cast members were performing characters who were more important in the previous two movies. I felt that they were there because they somewhat advanced the storyline, or were just there because they have been part of the series since the first movie in the franchise.I liked the chemistry between Stallone and Weathers in this film. In previous films, they were rivals, and now they are on the same side. They acted like two professionals in one of the toughest sports on the planet, one now acting more like a teacher more than a rival who was still annoyed at once losing the title to his now-student. Weathers really shined in this role, making the audience forget how arrogant he was six years before in the first movie.Another breakout performance was that of Mr. T. Surprisingly, as ""Balboa"" is getting back his edge, ""Lang"" is almost forgotten. The film focuses more on ""Balboa"" training for the rematch more than ""Lang"" living the life of the defending champion. You almost completely forget he was in the movie until he comes back into the story for the rematch. Personally, I would have liked to have seen some references to ""Lang"" as ""Balboa"" is in training. This was the role that gave Mr. T his tough guy image. He was the bad guy you wanted to see destroyed.This film is predictable. You know who will win at the end. Personally, I would have liked to have seen some plot twists that would have made the end a little less predictable.Another problem with this film is the soundtrack. I can only remember two songs in the film -- the ""Rocky Theme"" piece that is so recognizable now you know immediately where it came from, and ""Eye of the Tiger"" by the one-hit-wonder (this song) Survivor.Another problem with this film is, at times, it is hard to understand Stallone's speaking. At times, I had to rely on what others in the scene were saying in response to understand what was going on.Unless you already own the other movies, I say get this film on VHS/DVD to complete the series. I also think that this would be a pretty good third choice to rent.",Rocky III

But, whatever.If there was going to be a second addition, this should have been it. With Clubber holding the title and Rocky determined to take it. That would have been fine, but, no...Sly wanted riches. I can relate.Now, if you can forgive all that, there is fun to be had. It comes by way of Clubber Lang, the most awesome character of all Rocky's opponents. MR T plays this role very well; his best performance of that era. Without Clubber, however, Rocky III does not stand all that well.Although it is the most fun of the franchise, it is a miss in any other capacity.",Rocky III

163,tomasg-69814,Remember the amazing 80's.....,5,19 December 2015,"As artificial as film boxing can be, it peaked here. Yes, the IV fight with Dolph Lundgren (Ivan Drago ) is as incredible as these RIII fights. No, the strength of the Rocky sequels is not the boxing, it's in the struggle with personal life, and the before-and-after fight scenes, that Stallone lifts up his Rocky Balboa with some good acting sometimes. But he obviously thought that the audience wanted an always coming back-machine, who securely would punch out an 8 feet alien monster if he just gets ""mad enough"", in Paulie's words.No, I think the balance in this movie is brought by Carl Weathers, who's Apollo Creed gets nice to his former antagonist, and wants the newcomer Clubber Lang (well played by Laurence Tureaud/Mr. T) to smell the floor, and therefore puts his skills into slugger Rocky, and gets a rough piece of rock into a sharp diamond, but of course not without some motivation trouble on the way....Well, back in -82 this was surely a smash hit at the cinemas, but the Rocky series was sadly turned into too much way-out fiction. The fights of the two first movies are nice, the one in Rocky II has some very good choreography and directing, and the same last man standing sense that of the first. But after a bad episode V in 1990, Stallone waited 16 years and gave us some little more realism in the Rocky Balboa of 2006. Thank you for that, Sly.",Rocky III

This is a bigger, slicker, and more formulaic Rocky movie. It begins with, to the song ""Eye Of The Tiger"", a montage showing us Rocky successfully defending his title and at the same time, letting fame go to his head. He is, soon enough, brought down from his cloud by number one contender Clubber Lang, well played by Mr.T in his first movie role. Soon tragedy befalls Rocky, inside the ring and outside, and the only man who can help him is his old nemesis Apollo Creed. Once again, almost everyone from the previous one is back, with a humorous cameo from Hulk Hogan, but this time around they don't seem as into it and sort of run through the motions. And once again, Sylvester Stallone writes and directs, with weaker results in both areas.

Some people might argue with this by saying that Rocky 1 was the best as it showed the rise of Rocky in boxing and the romantic side from when he fell in love with Adrian, others might prefer Rocky 2 for when Rockys son was born, doing his TV commercial advertisement and when he became the Heavy weight champion of the world, while others might prefer Rocky 4 after the coming of boxer Ivan Drago, the sadness of Apollo Creed dying and when Rocky travelled to Russia. Although most of the Rocky films were spectacular, I have to say that Rocky 3 compared to the other Rocky films had so much more to offer compared to the other Rocky films as it was action packed and ongoing excitement all the way through the film. It had Rockys boss Micky dying, Mr.T and Hulk Hogan(and Wrestle-mania),the building of Rockys statue, it had Rocky losing everything and then getting it all back again and the brilliant one line quotes (ie. When the newscaster said to Clubber lang ""Whats your prediction for tomorrow nights fight""... Clubber Lang replies ""Prediction""...Newscaster replies ""Yes Prediction""... Clubber Lang replies... PAIN!! and from when Clubber Lang says to Rockys wife ""If you bring your pretty little self on down to my apartment tonight, I will show you a real man etc...) and not to mention the fact that this film had three fights while every other Rocky film had a maximum of two fights. Also for Rocky Balboa(Sylvester Stallone)to fight in the ring two hard man icons such as Mr. T and Hulk Hogan is quite a spectacular challenge for one Rocky film to offer as no other Rocky film has ever matched up to it.If you haven't seen the Rocky films, then watch Rocky 3, followed by the first two Rocky films for I gaurantee you that if you like boxing films, you will definitely like Rocky 3.",Rocky III

170,davidtkd-25249,Rocky III (1982): The Greatest Challenge,9,1 January 2018,"Rocky III (1982) is an American sports drama film starring Sylvester Stallone, Talia Shire, Burt Young, Carl Weathers, Burgess Meredith, and Mr. T. The film was written by and directed by Sylvester Stallone.The film starts with the classic ""ROCKY III"" side-scrolling intro , this time with The Ring Heavyweight Championship Title Belt in the background instead of a black background that was used in ROCKY (1976) and ROCKY II (1979). The film has a flashback of what happened from the previous installment, ROCKY II. We see the rematch between Rocky Balboa (The Challenger) and World Heavyweight Champion Apollo Creed. Both of the men after 14 rounds of intense fighting collapse to the ground. If Creed makes it back up, he retains the title. If Rocky makes it up, he is the new Heavyweight Champion of the World. If neither make it up, it is a draw and Creed automatically retains the title. Rocky makes it up while Apollo collapses. Rocky shocks the world and is crowned the NEW HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION OF THE WORLD. He throws the title over his shoulder and gives Mickey a hug in the final scene. After the flashback/intro, we are introduced to the beginning of ROCKY III. After winning the World Heavyweight Championship from Apollo Creed, Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) enjoys the rich life. He has had 10 title defenses and has won each and every won of them. He is currently on top of the world. 
He and his wife, Adrian (Talia Shire) are living very prosperous and have nothing to worry about. Rocky has now made millions of dollars and millions of fans across the world. Rocky goes to a press conference where he is awarded a statue of himself placed at the top of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Adrian and Rocky's trainer, Mickey Goldmill (Burgess Meredith) are with him as well. This is where Rocky announces his retirement. That is, until the #1 Ranked Heavyweight Contender - James ""Clubber"" Lang (Mr. T.) challenges him to a Championship bout. Rocky accepts the offer. Mickey is hesitant at first but Rocky convinces him to train him. Rocky, filled with the fans and money, becomes over confident with this fight. Mickey, however, wants him and Rocky to go back to the old gym and make Rocky train hard. Rocky declines. Eventually, the fight takes place. Mickey has a heart attack and is in critical condition. Rocky hesitates to go out and fight because of Mickey's health. He asks Adrian what to do. Mickey yells at him and tells him to go out and fight using a passionate tone. Rocky, taking Mickey's advice, goes out and fights Clubber. Rocky, undetermined and under confident from Mickey's heart problem, gets KO'd by Clubber Lang in the 2nd Round and loses the title. CLUBBER LANG is the NEW HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION OF THE WORLD. After the fight, Rocky rushes to Mickey's side and talks to him. Mickey expresses his admiration and respect for Rocky before slowly fading away. Mickey dies on the spot. Shortly after Mickey's death, Rocky and Adrian have a funeral for Mickey. The funeral is very short and very private. After the funeral, Rocky drives on his motorcycle through Philadelphia. He visits the ""ROCKY"" statue mentioned earlier in the film and he throws his helmet at the statue out of anger as to what has happened. He goes and visits ""Mighty Mick's Boxing"" Gym, which was were Rocky trained with Mickey before he died. He reminisces his past days. Former World Heavyweight Champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) talks to Rocky and offers to train him for a rematch with Clubber Lang. Rocky accepts. Rocky, Adrian, Apollo, and Paulie (Rocky's friend; Adrian's brother) (Burt Young) go to California. Apollo trains Rocky there at Tough Gym where Apollo started training as a boxer. Rocky starts training like a bum afraid of the fight and having little confidence in himself. Apollo and Adrian encourage him to fight with full 100% heart, but for himself. Not over Mickey's death, not for the money or fans, and not for the title. Rocky then puts 100% into his training. We are shown a training montage with Creed training Rocky and Creed running with Rocky across the beach. The rematch takes place at Madison Square Garden. Apollo wants Rocky to wear his ""American"" (Red, White, and Blue) trunks that Creed wore in the original fight with Rocky Balboa from the original ROCKY (1976). Rocky agrees and Apollo mentions a favor that Rocky owes him after the fight is over. Rocky and Clubber head into the ring with their crew at ringside. The fight begins. Rocky and Clubber go head to head. Rocky then uses his stamina and lets the champ beat him up really hard. Rocky waits until Clubber is tired and then goes in with the punches. Rocky KO'S Clubber Lang in the 3rd Round. Rocky exhausted from the match, joins with Adrian, Paulie, and Creed. Rocky Balboa is for a second time crowned the NEW HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION OF THE WORLD. Rocky joins Creed in the gym for a fight behind closed doors with no press or media. Just a fair fight. Rocky and Apollo go in with punches and the film ends with Rocky and Creed fighting. It is unknown who wins the fight. End Credits. ""Rocky III"" was made on a budget of $17,000,000. The film grossed $270,000,000, making it the 2nd most successful film financially in the entire series.Sylvester Stallone returned to direct ROCKY III (1982), after previously directing ROCKY II (1979). He directed the film due to John G. Avildsen (the director of the original ROCKY) rejecting. John G. Avildsen rejected to direct the film because he deeply wanted Stallone to direct the film after the massive success of ROCKY II.The movie's hit song, Survivor - ""Eye of the Tiger"" topped the charts and was nominated an Academy Award for Best Original Song. This song is still referenced and used to this day. ROCKY III (1982) is a very interesting sequel as it is much different from its predecessors. While not as good as ROCKY and ROCKY II, ROCKY III is still a classic and one of the best in the ROCKY franchise. Highly recommended. 9/10.",Rocky III
171,liamkellybusiness,Definitely underrated.,7,5 May 2020,"I've always felt the first two movies were necessary in Rocky's story of going from an underdog nobody to a well respected world champion and that the next 4 sequels were quite the opposite - unnecessary.
Although I still believe that, I do feel like Rocky III is very much an underrated film, not just in the series but in general too.
Showing Rocky's shift towards retirement was a satisfying way to finish off the trilogy and where I feel it should have ended.",Rocky III
172,rogergotch,The prettiest heavyweight boxer ever,10,16 January 2021,"Rocky has a very straight nose for somebody who gets hit in the face for a living. In this outing he suffers a bruising - poetic justice for neglecting his Step-Brother Pauley. I mean he stole Pauley sister offa him, rose to world acclaim and wealth and just left Pauley in the gutter. Its nice to be important but its important to be nice ! Rocky learns the hard way. Somehow Mister T got time off from the A-team to film this. Mister T never liked pretty boys like 'face' and Rocky. Too pretty. Hulk Hogan is a scream, throwing Rocky around like a toothpick. Pro wrestling is showbiz but those big men are seriously strong. Burgess Meredith's 'Mickey' was zeroed-out giving this sequel an added emotional impact, but the actor himself would go on to live to 90 and pass away in 1997.",Rocky III

175,garywoodburn,boxing clever,7,23 March 2006,Watching Rocky 3 again  I was struck by how nice a bookend to the whole piece it would have been. I'm a huge fan of these movies  I believe they rise above the popcorn bracket they are placed in.As much as i love the idea of 4 and 5 and 6 for that matter it gets a bit ridiculous to watch his IQ rise and fall through the series. Indeed by 2007 when the last is released we should expect to see a bubbling wreck a la the once mighty Ali  which might have been a nice character piece  but what we'll get maybe we'll get that one in a few years. But back to Rocky 3. Mr T is menacing  Coach is frail and plucky and the Adrian/Paulie siblings continue to annoy rather than add to the story. Adrian now seems adept at motivational speaking and Paulie just plain gets on the nerves. The reason I say it would make a perfect end to the series is that a lot of things come full circle. Rocky and his one time enemy become friends  Mickey dies and Adrian blossoms fully. Rocky proves that he is not just a one time lucky bum made good by beating not just the new threat to the throne but his own fears. Sure it's east to see it doesn't have the gravitas of the original but it has moments. And above all else Stallone created a character that people just love to get behind.A worthy film to any DVD collection. Take it for what it is and not what others try to make of it. It's good solid entertainment and won't disappoint.,Rocky III

(And may I say that I know for a fact this man liked his girlfriend to tie him up and p**s on his face. Would you take film criticism from such a dirty dirty man? I know I damn well wouldn't).And anyway  this isn't the worst film ever made because the worst film ever made is some crap like 'Fried Green Tomatoes' or one of those straight to DVD movies you see for sale in a garage. You know the ones - they 'guest star' Billy Zane or Patrick Bergen or some other poor excuse for an actor or actress (such as Julia Roberts).No. This film is great because it's got Mr T in it smacking the living crap out of everyone before getting his comeuppance at the end of Rocky's fists. And it's got 'Eye Of The Tiger' as its theme tune (which is the musical equivalent of fighting in an alleyway). And Apollo is Rocky's mate in this one which is what we all wanted to happen. And Mickey the trainer dies which is more emotional than any other screen death I've ever witnessed (with the possible exception of Connery's Irish/Scottish character in The Untouchables or Goose in Top Gun).Up yours p**s-in-your-face man! I'm right and you're wrong because I'd never let anyone p**s in my face and that's the end of THAT.",Rocky III

Rocky loses against clubber lang (played by mr t) then seeks revenge and also to win back his title, (i think just for mickeys sake).But this movie shows a no fear boxer going up against the bright hearted Rocky, so unlike rocky 6 skill vs will rocky 3 is power vs heart. This film shows just how much of a gentleman Apollo really is as well. Overall i give rocky III a 8/10 for its good acting and decent rehased story line. This is the only film to use the EYE OF THE TIGER themetune which i think is pretty unfair.",Rocky III

182,flyingcandy,Apollos's Film,9,21 May 2007,"This film belongs to Carl Weathers. His character ""Apollo Creed"" is not only the best character, but the most important. There are two stories here: one about a champion who has been fighting semi-good boxers to remain on top, and then losing to a real fighter (""Clubber Lang""). Then there is the story of the fallen champ who teaches the newly fallen champ how to be a ""real fighter"". This is the story that shines, and ties everything together, and makes this the second best Rocky film in the series. Burt Young's ""Paulie"" is hilarious too, especially the way he reacts to the living conditions in downtown L.A. when Apollo brings Rocky to train there. I highly recommend this movie for anyone who wants to be ""pumped up"" and/or motivated. Okay, it's corny here and there, but it's Rocky, not Shakespeare... Thank God!",Rocky III

The build up to the final fight, the music, the training sequences they are all great fun to watch and as a viewer you do get drawn into the movies Rocky 3 does not really provide anything new but it builds well upon the existing formula of Rocky films. One thing that I would like to mention is the one thing about all Rocky films is that Stallone does draw from his own personal experiences when doing this film. If we examine Rocky 3 we can see that it is about a person who's fame has gone to his head, he is no longer in touch with reality and if Stallone was honest this is reflection of himself at the time as well. This is extremely well documented within the film and surely sends out a clear message to the trappings of becoming famous.There are some great moments in the films e.g when Rocky says to Adrian 'Nothing is real if you don't believe in it any more'. How true is this statement and all the people who can convince you to believe in yourself it's your wife, the scene truly can hit home to a lot of people",Rocky III
189,krolewskimichael,Rocky meets the 80's,7,7 August 2018,"I've always loved this installment in the Rocky series. It was actually the first one that I saw when I was a kid and at the time thought it was the best one. However, in retrospect it was really more about money, commercialism and excess in the 80's. I would say Vince Mcmahon of the WWE has Stallone to thank, because of the great exposure he brought to Hulk Hogan, Mr. T for that matter, and professional wrestling. The pacing of the movie is faster and more intense than the first two movies, however Rocky sort of became what you didn't like. He's got loads of money, and he not the down and out paluka that he used to be, although at one point of the movie he is. It's definitely not the worst of the series but slightly lacks the heart of the first two movies, partially because of the death of Burgess Meredith's character Mickey. Still an exciting sequel",Rocky III

Adrian's speech had me in tears, and Talia Shire has finally, in the serious, ceased being this annoying little mousy wallflower as she had been in the Rocky series prior to this moment.Stallone's and Mr T's physiques were incredible.

192,yesjozee,Probably one of the best sequels ever made.,9,6 February 2012,"In the summer of 1982 I recall the attack of the sequels for any or all franchises. This was one of the reasons that may have been tough promoting another ""Rocky"" movie-but alas another mega hit was made. I always respected the original Oscar winner for being original and a very personal story I felt to it's star. But for the life of me I never felt it's power until it's final shot. There was already a long awaited rematch that everyone was always curious about if you asked the average ""Rocky"" fan and they delivered in ""Rocky II."" So to come back and try to convince fans that ""The Italian Stallion"" had some more magic would be hard trick. The opening scenes start where the 2nd film ended him triumphant in his re-match with Apollo. From there we're given a montage of his success in boxing since he beat Apollo. We're also simultaneously introduced to his new adversary played by that's right Mr.T. Why does all of this work? As much as glossy TV ad take over of Hollywood into movies there's been cool things and they're have been unforgivable things.

So in ""Rocky III"", Stallone gives us two heavyweight bouts.  Mr. T is the evilest villain, playing the role he was meant to play. For good measure, Stallone even throws in an hilarious ""exhibition match"" between Rocky and ""Thunderlips"", played by a little known pro wrestler, Hulk Hogan.In these matches, the viewer feels the power of every punch, the awesome impact of every landed blow.

But watching Rocky 3 again now I'm amazed I missed its subtle subtext of homosexuality amongst American boxers. When Apollo Creed approaches Rocky in the romantically dimmed gym in the middle of the night and calls him ""babe"", I suddenly saw the film in a new light. Then when Rocky says ""you got me curious"" and they lovingly stare at each other quietly, I realized the writers were taking the boxing legend into a new ring. The scene of Rocky and Apollo jumping up and down in the ocean in slow motion together in high cut pants was also something I missed as a kid. Then the punchy hook, as Mr T arrives, a surefire symbol of Rocky's denied homosexuality. His playful banter with Rocky's wife, ""I'll show you a real man"".

196,Schenkenberg112,I Want Balboa.,6,5 May 2021,"With 'Rocky III' Stallone went full out with a flashy spectacle show. Stallone admits that he started to run out of ideas and it shows. While the two previous movies were dramatic stories that included boxing scenes the third one is epic training and fighting montage with a couple of dramatic scenes in between. 'Rocky III' is a fast-paced action movie. Regardless of this, the Academy Award-nominated 'Rocky III' manages to maintain the dramatic punch equally well as its inspirational message. This film includes a couple of my favorite moments from the whole Rocky franchise.Rocky Balboa is still Rocky. A bit matured and sophisticated now, he has learned some manner and behavior but he is still a simple (not a simpleton) fighter with the heart of gold. He is now doing good - wearing designer suits, driving luxurious cars, and lives in a big mansion with his family. But Rocky seems to be less fazed by all the money and glamour than in the second movie. It shows that his character had grown. One of the most powerful scenes was where Rocky learned from Mickey that all his title defending fights were with opponents specially chosen for him. This wasn't particularly cheating but Rocky felt like a cheater. A naive man who was in the business just for the love for sports was devastated by the harsh reality of dirty politics. And the lack of confidence from Mickey causes Rocky's self-confidence to drop. I like that Stallone wrote Rocky Balboa as a character who always learns from the best to overcome obstacles. Like in this movie, although he was a champion who had defended his title numerous times by then, he still went to train under the tutoring of his old rival Apollo Creed.Adrian steps further from a strong supportive wife. This time she is a strong wife who must drag Rocky through the slump, and she does it convincingly. When Rocky admits to her on the beach that he is afraid, and Adrian makes a speech in a manner of a loving wife, a best friend, and a caring mother all combined. And these were powerful words (there must be something seriously wrong with you if you didn't feel affected by that speech). Apollo Creed is now in the corner of Rocky. After Mickey passes away and Rocky loses the fight to Clubber Lang on the same night, Apollo Creed decides to train Rocky. Why? Why he couldn't take on Clubber Lang? Although retired, Creed still seemed to be in shape and he was a clever strategist in the ring. With that turn in the story, Apollo Creed's character arc gets probably the movie's most amazing development - Apollo is contemplated his loss to Rocky and is finally at peace with himself (and through that with the world). I like the kind of characters who are tough and proud and they will go to lengths to achieve something remarkable (to become a world champion boxer). But after the loss of all their (public) glory, they can go and accept the defeat. And even when they get the chance to prove their worth again, they now don't need the attention of the others - they can do it all just for themselves. Just like Apollo's and Rocky's match at the end of the movie (only later on, when the 'Creed' was released, we learned that this bout was won by Apollo).Unfortunately, we don't get much of the back story on the Clubber Lang - he is just a mean guy who wants to beat up people. Mr. T pulled that part of perfectly thanks to his already menacing persona, but without any story behind his rage, he just stayed a pully (remember how quickly, just with a couple of sentences, was Apollo Creed's character and his whole background established in the first movie). I know, Mr. T is not much of an actor besides making angry faces and pitting the fools but it would have been nice to see Clubber Lang has some redeeming angle.Also, what happened with Paulie? He had seemingly got his life in order in the second movie (if you can call being a debt collector for a loan shark getting your life together) and now he again had receded to drinking miserable man child blaming everyone around him. What happened with his job at Gazzo's? As Rocky is playing now in the higher league, I can understand Gazzo not being part of his life anymore, but Paulie.'Rocky III' is a sleek, fast-paced action movie. The pacing of the storyline is near perfect. The final fight between Rocky Balboa and Clubber Lang is probably the best choreographed, directed, and edited fight scenes in the whole Rocky franchise. There are things in the screenplay that can be nitpicked - what happened to Rocky's career-ending eye injury, and while Mickey was worried about Rocky getting hurt, he still let him fight with Thunderlips? Overall 'Rocky III' proudly carries the main spirit and message of the Rocky franchise. And that's what matters most, I guess.I feel that this could have been the perfect finale to a near-perfect trilogy - Rocky, Adrian, Apollo and by the end of this movie even Paulie (again) had finally reached somewhere. Their stories felt completed at the end of this movie. On the other hand, although unnecessary inclusion in the whole Rocky story, 'Rocky IV' gave us one of the most infamous on-screen fighters ever: Ivan Drago.",Rocky III
197,twk00,Not great but an acceptable 3rd film in the series.,6,26 March 2012,"Rocky 3 is a film stuck in a time capsule. It is very much an 80's film. Look there's Mr. T! Hulk Hogan! Eye of the Tiger! It is a continuation of the story of Rocky's life as he lives the life of a champion with endorsements, riches, glory...but the hunger of his youth all but gone. This is a story about Rocky rediscovering his passion for boxing and it is reasonably entertaining. One thing is clear...this movie is nowhere near the level of the original film, but it holds a certain nostalgia for those of a certain age who grew up with the character. Written and directed by Stallone himself Rocky 3 could have been a decent end to a nice little trilogy. It's entertaining, and the acting is not bad with Burgess Meredith as Mickey coming off the best. Mr. T became a big star after his performance as antagonist Clubber Lang. The best thing you can say about this movie is it wasn't an embarrassment unlike some later entries in the series. I'm looking at you Rocky 4 and 5.",Rocky III
198,mbb-24511,My favorite guilty pleasure movie,8,27 September 2020,"It's not a great movie like the first two Rocky movies, but it's not complete shlocky fun like 4. It's somewhere in the middle but I kinda love it anyway.The story itself has legitimately interesting points for the series, particularly the first act where we see Rocky Balboa during the highlights of his career. He's no longer the scrappy underdog anymore, he's the one everyone is gunning for now and we see him transform from the nobody from Philadelphia to the marketable sports icon. By the time we're introduced to the driving force of the story we see a clear parallel between Rocky and the former champion, Apollo Creed. Seeing Rocky lose to Clubber Lang represents an unprecedented moment in his life, going from being in the limelight to essentially a nobody again. By the end of the movie you want to see him win again not as an underdog anymore, instead you want to see him leave the ring without any regrets.The acting isn't as great this time around compared to the first two but I think Mr. T deserves some credit for his portrayal as Clubber Lang. It isn't some complex role with a ton of depth to his character but he does a great job of carrying himself as a raw, powerful force to be dealt with. Much like Bane from the Dark Knight Rises it's tense seeing Rocky and Clubber fight for the first time and to see your protagonist clearly out of his league which sets up uncertainty for the inevitable rematch.There's more to talk about for sure but you can easily just watch this movie solely at face value and be entertained. The pacing is pretty solid and it's satisfying on some bizarre, primal level to see two guys punch each other with sound mixing that sounds like someone throwing large ribeye steaks against a concrete wall as hard as they can. And who doesn't love a classic montage, this time with ""Eye of the Tiger"" playing over the footage?Rocky 3 is definitely the turning point between the slower-paced stories of Rocky 1&2 and the glorious shlock of Rocky 4. It's not an Oscar darling anymore but it's definitely worth checking out, especially if you like the rest of the series.",Rocky III
199,Luke S,A very good boxing sequel,7,2 December 2002,"Rocky III (1982) is a fun film. We open up a montage of Rocky defending his world championship over the tunes of the awesome ""Eye of the Tiger"" by Survivor. The early scenes show Rocky enjoying his life as world champ, especially in a great wrestler vs boxer match for charity. Rocky's opponent is none other than the great Hulk Hogan. We are then introduced to Clubber Lang, a brutal brawler that promises to be Rockys ""Greatest Challenge"". Rockys ailing manager, Mickey, tells Rocky that retirement is his best option, since he no longer has the hunger that he did when he first had the title. Rocky ignores Micks  pleads, and goes down to Lang with Mickey suffering a heart attack in the locker room. With his title in the hands of a young champion and his beloved trainer gone, it looks like Rockys career might be over...but wait....its Apollo Creed...to save the day!!! With Creed by his side Rocky is injected with a great amount of fighting spirit and develops skills that he never thought possible. Now with the ""eye of the tiger"" regained, Rocky and Apollo are ready to win back the title. Rocky III has a good story, great fight pieces, and good performances.",Rocky III

201,IsaiMegan,"Rocky + Mr. T = Typical Rocky Sequel, good and bad. Enjoy!",6,21 September 2009,"Rocky III may be the Rocky Sequel that time forgot, but it's not that far off from other Rocky sequels in terms of quality and emotion. Rocky movies usually have a moral overtone, and this one is no different. Rocky get's complacent and loses his championship as a result. He also has to deal with loss in the characteristic Rocky formula when Micky dies. In the end, as usual, he trains hard and comes back to overcome his opponent. Throw in a few appearances by Hulk Hogan and Mr. T and you have yourself an 80s movie. It's hard to know how to feel about this movie. Then again it's hard to know how to feel about Rocky in general. On the one hand, the fight scenes are totally unrealistic. But Stallone pulls you in with his emotional and pityful character. The acting is never bad. But the writing is meant to be more soap opera than serious drama. If you were to see this movie on it's own, it's pretty cheesy. But in the context of Rocky films in general, it's actually not that bad. Mr. T actually gives one of the best performances of this movie. He is very believable as the bitter and cruel Clubber Lang (try to ignore the ridiculous names of characters like these). Tony Burton doesn't get as much face time as ""Duke"" in this picture, but in my humble opinion he is the best actor out of the entire cast. As for Burgess Meredith, Carl Weathers, Burt Young, and Talia Shire, they all give their consistent decent performances. Stallone really makes you feel for him, truly mastering the ""gentle giant"" character. It is heart wrenching watching him get his face beat in, even if the fighting is totally unrealistic. Overall, this is a typical Rocky movie. Nothing compares to the raw emotion of the original Rocky, but if you like the series and you have a few hours to kill, this is an entertaining movie.",Rocky III

All the stuff makes you want to fight. Its like watching a gole in a middle of a hockey match all the time.. you shout and says ""damn"" or ""yesssss""... Even the training gives the reaction of ""ok... Im gonna do push-ups the rest of this movie with plessure..."" Me and my friends love it. After seeing it I use two shadow box for two days and when I meet a friend I normally boxes with him a lot... And Ive seened this movie very many times so...

If you're a first time watcher of Rocky 3 and 4 today / your're most likely unable to appreciate these of the - then - spit and polished versions of Rocky. The point I'm trying to make is this - if I were to try and watch the very original B&W King Kong movie with fresh eyes, this movie will be uninspiring and look awful - bad music - effects, etc....But the movie is memorized as ground breaking.So before those of you who vote and remark on a movie made before your time, try and grasp the concept of an Era..\",Rocky III
204,iane420,17 out of 10 one of the greatest movies of all time,10,28 January 2005,"Rocky III is an automatic 17 out of 10. Rocky I gets all the press and awards but it cannot hold a candle to the genius that is Rocky III and Mr T. The fact that Mr. T did not win (and Wasn't EVEN NOMINATED for) an Oscar for this film is a modern day tragedy. Rocky III is by far the best of the Rocky movies. It is definitely an epic film. The only drawback is the horrid Talia Shire rears her ugly head once again as Adrian. However, this can easily be over looked by the greatness that is Mr. T.In fact, someone should have given Clubber Lang his own spin off movie. Now that would have been a movie. But I digress.

207,Barry-103,The cheese factor really started going up at this point in the franchise,5,25 March 2018,"Pretty cheesy movie. If true heavy weight fighters hit each other that often with right and left hooks they would be dead. With the medical staff at a fight, Mick can't get a doctor while having a heart attack? Then there's the self centered (what about me?) Paulie. He's now an entitled elitist and racist. (Arriving in a predominately black gym) Paulie: ""I gotta get out of here. I've got a reputation."" and ""I don't like these people."" and (While Rocky is training) ""He can't train to the jungle junk music."" But it's the same old story. Rocky can't win when he trains in a fancy gym surrounded by girls and media. But when he trains in a old dirty gym and runs on the beach, he get's the eye of the tiger.",Rocky III

210,PhoKingNick,"Big old dumb fun boxing movie that doesn't come close to the original, but it doesn't really need to.",5,13 December 2016,"Easily the most shallow of the first three. The length of this film does hurt it a bit in that sense, seeing that it's 30 minutes shorter than the first two. A lot of the drama in this one lacks any emotional weight, so I just take this one as some light entertainment for an hour and a half. The main antagonist is very one dimensional, but he is entertaining to watch, even if he is a giant cartoon. Unfortunately, it feels as though this movie just kind of exists when it doesn't need to, but there's still a bit of fun to be had with it. The matches are entertaining, but again, there's hardly any emotional weight behind them, so they are much less thrilling than the final match at the end of the first film. All in all, if you enjoy the other Rocky movies and what to be mildly entertained for a solid hour and a half and not really care about any good drama, then by all means pop this baby in.",Rocky III
211,Kimyager10,It's a fun movie to watch.,8,3 December 2016,"In this film, Rocky has many problems. The loss of his coach, the loss of his long-held title, makes him deeply shaken. These problems are expressed in the film very well. When we look at the players we see Sylvester Stallone in the role of Rocky, Talia Shire in the role of Adrian, Burt Young in the role of Paulie, Burgess Meredith in the role of Mickey, Carl Weathers in the role of Apollo, Mr.T in the role of Clubber Lang really did a very good job. Especially, Mr.T plays very well. It's a film that should be watched except for a few bugs to look at in general. The biggest mistake in the film is that in the first film of the Rocky series Mickey says 'I am 76 years old' but Micky seems to have died at the age of 76. It was a really big mistake. But overall it's a pretty good movie.",Rocky III
212,Doc-98,"MR. T is hungry for some ""Piti fool"" Rocky in this hilarious blockbuster motion picture of 1982",10,30 December 1998,"This is Rocky III which makes the Rocky films officially a trilogy. This film lacks the drama aspect that the first two soared with. But it doesn't matter, I mean Rocky Balboa as already proved that ""He did it!"". What drama could there really be after Rocky II? So instead of closing the book on the film Stallone decided to make this more of an action film. I just loved it. Most critics thumbed down this one and bombed the last two. This movie is great fun and with a heart. Rocky is now enormously rich and famous. He's won more championships and decides to call it quits. But a new opponent(Mr.T) wants Rocky to fight him. Rocky decides to fight one more time. But alas for poor Rocky he has become foggy with all his fame and fortune and has unknowingly lost his ""Eye of the Tiger"". He kepts hurt by Mr. T and has to make a comeback. He teams up with Appolo Creed and wins back his fighting spirit. The final fight sequence is brief and satisfying. The film grossed nearly 150 million and I loved it. I just wish it is released on DVD on day. The Rocky trilogy is the most engrossing and entertaining sequential movies ever. On one last note for all you Rocky fans, get this: I was reading a recent issue of the Cinescape magazine and I found a mentioning that STALLONE IS CONSIDERING A ROCKY VI!!! It's not official, but is was written in ink. Thank you, and good night.",Rocky III

Seen each film 50 times and i've seen great films like the godfather and many films in the top 250 on the internet movie database. Rocky 3 is an exceptional film which inspired an entire nation he has more fights in this film then any other Rocky film to date. This film deserves a way better rating it was one of the biggest hits in the 60's and it's not even a 7. The movie was utterly outstanding and the biggest film buff nick V even enjoyed the film immensely it's the embodiment of entertainment, OK i might have over exaggerated but without a doubt it deserves more then a 7.",Rocky III
214,yankees2703,Pretty Good.... But nowhere near the 2 that preceded it.,6,16 July 2006,"The film is pretty easy to comprehend. Rocky 3 deals with Rocky's fame and status rising after his second battle with Apollo Creed. After winning his 10th title defense, Rocky is challenged to a fight by the number one contender Clubber Lang (Mr. T). Micky reluctantly agrees to help him train for the last time. Mickey undergoes complications before the fight begins, which upsets Rocky. He wants to call off the fight, but Mickey tells him to go out and fight. Rocky's thoughts lie with Mickey as Clubber brutally defeats him in the second round. After the fight, Mickey dies. After the funeral, Rocky enters into a state of depression. Apollo Creed offers to help train Rocky and help him regain his edge. Not my favorite rocky movie, but definitely worth watching.",Rocky III
215,gato821190,An entertaining movie,10,12 October 2001,"I don't know why many people bash this movie.  It's my favorite in the series.  It shows that anyone who gets complacent about where he or she is in life will not achieve his or her full potential.  Rocky defeats a number of challengers after defeating Apollo Creed and is challenged by a hungry heavyweight contender named Clubber Lang.  Rocky gets lazy with his training and gets clobbered.  The twist that I really like is his old nemesis, Apollo Creed, wants to train Rocky for personal reasons.  Rocky's lack of spirit shows in the beginning of the training.  He then is motivated by a speech from his wife and gets his hunger back.  I just like the fact that it shows if you're not hungry, you will not achieve your goals.  Take my comments for what they're worth, just my opinion.",Rocky III

217,chris-hedderley,an excellent story of a true underdog getting back on top,10,9 November 2010,"Rocky is one of my all time favourite series of films and Rocky three, in my opinion is the best one ever. It gives the fans the chance to see that people can fall from grace, but can get themselves back on top and achieve there biggest goals. This is a message for all audiences i think. Its not about how hard you fall; we all saw Rocky hit the mat in round three. Its s about how determined your are to get back up. Rocky sets out to show true reality in many ways. The film shows us raw emotions through its characters and true love which helps Rocky get back on his feet. Its also proves that our enemies can become our true friends.The best part of the film for me is the transition of Rocky. He goes from being on top of the world, with the heavyweight title around his waist, to getting beaten and being looked on as passed it and old, to once again proving he is the best and defeating the mighty Clubber Lang. For me Rocky gives me motivation. It teaches me that anything is possible, you just need to put your mind to it.",Rocky III

Excellent acting, excellent storyline, everything is brilliant.Mr T has got attitude, and when rocky loses his first match and has a little chat with adrian on the beach, then the training starts. With eye of the tiger, a classical soundtrack that is like no other. An absolute masterpiece.The fights are marvelous. Especially the slow motion bits. The film is well directed as well. One thing that is a shame in this film is the death of mickey. What a shame. He was such a great character.

The scenes with Apollo training even reawakening Rocks will to fight , hie 'eye of the tiger' , are superb. Clubbers great so many classic one liners 'No I don't hate Balboa , I Pity da Fool' The way Rocky actually out boxed Clubber in the films climax is a refreshing change from the others where , Drago especially n Rock just beat each other senseless.

220,eservina,Without a doubt the best film of the series...,10,27 April 2005,"Rocky 3 is without a doubt the best film in the series. Rocky I and II are tremendous films that focus more on Rocky and Adrian's love for one another and their journey from unhappiness to complete fulfillment. Rocky IV while visually stunning, is verging on SCI-FI it is so unrealistic( I still can't get over 2000PSI!!) and Rocky V makes the whole journey seem almost worthless. But the third film in my opinion has the perfect blend. From the supercharged ""Eye of the Tiger"" opening to the classic Rocky v Apollo ending, this film just does not let up. All of the cast act their socks off here, none more so than Stallone himself. The scene of Mickey's death after Rocky's destruction at the hands of Clubber Lang is brilliant- you can feel the genuine emotion Stallone has for Mickey's character and the chemistry between Meredith and Stallone is there up to the very last scene they had together. But the Masterstroke here lies in making Apollo a far more central character after Mickey's death. Carl Weathers pulls of a huge feat in this film in that he fills Meredith's shoes so to speak- not an easy job when you consider just how important Mickey is to the Rocky films. WOW, all of this and I still haven't even mentioned CLUBBER! Clubber Lang is a great adversary for Rocky and the power and intensity his character displays in the ring is ferocious. The second fight between Rocky and Clubber is just breathtaking, the pace of the fight is electric, some of the camera work makes you feel like you are literally in the ring with these two warriors. And more importantly here we see Balboa at his absolute peak- technically and physically, he actually looks and fights like a man who is the BEST fighter in the world. Rocky evolves in this film into a boxer with speed, skill, intelligence and power. A triumph of a movie that I would recommend to anyone with the slightest interest in being entertained!",Rocky III
