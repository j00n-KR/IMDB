0,TheLittleSongbird,Such a beautiful film...,10,22 August 2011,"The book is one of my favourites, and I just loved this film. As an adaptation, it succeeds, apart from Curley's wife it is fairly faithful. But the real revelation of this Of Mice and Men is how well it succeeds on its own terms. The film looks absolutely gorgeous, with the scenery and photography very striking, while the score is moving and perhaps even nostalgic. The story still maintains the emotional impact especially at the end, and Of Mice and Men is beautifully scripted and directed. The performances are uniformly excellent. John Malkovich and Gary Sinise give very powerful performances, particularly Sinise, and Sherilyn Fenn has never been more appealing, however it was Ray Walston as Candy that I identified most with. All in all, a beautiful movie. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Of Mice and Men
1,SnoopyStyle,Very good performances,7,18 October 2014,"Based on John Steinbeck's classic novel, George Milton (Gary Sinise) and Lennie Small (John Malkovich) are traveling through the Depression era landscape. The guys are on the run as a woman runs away screaming. They have dreams of owning a small farm together. They have jobs lined up at the Tyler Ranch. The Boss (Noble Willingham) is a hard man. Candy (Ray Walston) is the old worker with one good arm. Curley (Casey Siemaszko) is the mean-spirited son of the boss. His wife (Sherilyn Fenn) is flirtatious and won't leave George alone.The material is always great. It's just a matter if the actors are up to the material. In this case, both Sinise and Malkovich are fully up to the task. Malkovich may not have the bulk but he has the presence. He brings out the perfect tone of humanity and innocence. Sinise is always the protective brother in the relationship. These are very good performances.",Of Mice and Men
2,classicsoncall,"""I done a really bad thing.""",8,24 November 2020,"I like Gary Sinise and John Malkovich as actors, but I think if you asked them, both would admit that their version of this movie doesn't hold a candle to the original 1939 picture, with Burgess Meredith in the George Milton role, and Lon Chaney portraying his mentally challenged traveling companion, Lennie Small. That picture has a much more nuanced story line, with greater emotional impact in those scenes involving the death of Candy's dog, the sense of isolation and loneliness conveyed by the stable buck Crooks to Lennie in that bunkhouse chat, and most emphatically, in the final denouement when George is faced with the decision to deny the hunting posse its capture and punishment of Lennie. Viewed without making such a comparison if you haven't seen the prior film, this one does hold up well in representing the John Steinbeck novel on which it's based, but again, also with some reservations. For example, Curley's wife (Sherilyn Fenn) is portrayed here in a manner to suggest a sex starved woman looking for a cheap thrill to go along with her loneliness, whereas her primary motive in the novel and to some extent the earlier picture, was to just have someone to talk to. Interestingly, the screenplay for this movie didn't offer a name for Curley's (Casey Siemaszko) wife; in the original picture, her name was Mae.Not to sound too negative about this film, I did enjoy it while watching, if enjoy is a proper word to use to describe this thought provoking picture. If one is not familiar with the story, you'll note scene after scene and dialog that tends to telegraph what leads up to the tragic finale. If not readily apparent, it becomes more than obvious upon a second viewing. Still, if you haven't seen the 1939 original, I would highly recommend it for it's in depth treatment of the secondary characters, and particularly Lon Chaney's stunning turn as Lennie, in what has to be regarded as his finest screen performance. It received a Best Picture nomination at the 1940 Academy Awards, probably the best field of movies to ever go up for the Oscar, and in good company with pictures like ""Stagecoach"", ""The Wizard of Oz"", and ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"". To my mind, it was as good as all of those, but there was no way the win that year was going to any movie but ""Gone With The Wind"".",Of Mice and Men
3,jboothmillard,Of Mice and Men,6,14 September 2005,"Based on some book and directed by one of the stars himself, this is a not too bad story about two best friends who find work on a farm near a ranch house. The two main characters, John Malkovich as the big tall child like Lennie Small and Gary Sinise (also director) as the small quite intelligent George Milton are the two men, on the run from something, and they want some work so they can have enough money to get a new life. By the way, Lennie's child like because he was kicked by a horse as a kid. Lennie has a love for animals and soft things, and sometimes it ends up him accidentally breaking or killing the person or animal with his uncontrollable strength. Also starring Ray Walston as Candy, Casey Siemaszko as Curley, Sherilyn Fenn as Curley's Wife, Lost's John Terry as Slim and Terminator 2's Joe Morton as Crooks. It is quite a sad moment at the end, and the villain is pretty nasty, but it is still quite good. Good!",Of Mice and Men
4,dbdumonteil,...and a hutch full of rabbits,8,10 September 2004,"""Of mice and men"" is one of these movies we definitely need in our times.Gary Sinise 's directing is classic in the noblest sense of the term.The cinematography recalls some of those Ford (who adapted ""Grapes of wrath"",another Steinbeck's novel for the screen) gems of the forties or fifties.It is heart-rending to see Malkovich and his portrayal of the half-wit is one of the finest you can see in a nineties movies and leaves,for instance Dustin Hoffman's ""rain man"" character far behind.It takes a lot of guts to play such demeaning parts !Gary Sinise should not be forgotten either,in a performance which offers all the subtleties of the heart.What moves me in the movie is the loneliness which frightens the characters .Everyone is searching for someone to rely on.Not only the two heroes (I think that ,actually, George needs more Lennie than the other way about)but also the old man -the scene with the old dog is almost unbearable;it will have an equivalent in a terrifying way at the end recalling Horace MacCoy's ""they shoot horses don't they?""- Curley's wife;only the black guy has resigned himself to solitude.The scene when Candy and the two pals are talking of their future house -which we know from the very start they'll never have- is really heartwarming.At least,for one precious and fleeting moment,they could dream of a home,a fireplace and a hutch full of rabbits.",Of Mice and Men
5,edwagreen,Of Mice and Men...Here Come the Parasites. **1/2,5,10 November 2010,"What's the big fuss about this 1992 remake? Steinbeck was a Communist through and through in his depiction of American life whether it was in this film or 1940's ""The Grapes of Wrath."" He was always consumed with migrant workers during the Great Depression years.In this film, John Malkovich portrays the dimwitted Lenny. Mentally retarded but physically strong, Malkovich gave quite a performance. Gary Sinise, a terrific actor, who also directed this film, is George, who goes along with Lenny all the way. Lenny has basically become an albatross around George's neck. Due to his physical strength, he is constantly in trouble and this invariably leads to tragedy. While George takes the ultimate step to free Lenny from his misery and impending doom, Lenny is also freed by the action he takes.",Of Mice and Men
6,Theo Robertson,Competent Except For Malcovich,6,22 August 2002,"I`ve probably read OF MICE AND MEN more times than I`ve read any other novel , not because I like it but because for some reason the book is always used in O` grade ( That`s the elementary standard exam used in British schools and was replaced by the GCSE exam round about 1990 ) English learning . I read it many times at school and had to re read it again when I was a student several years later and so I very quickly learned to hate it , especially the over sentimental aspects .The problem I have with this version is John Malkovich`s performance . There`s not much wrong with Malkovich as an actor and looking at his resume he`s undoubtedly Hollywood`s most eclectic actor appearing in prestigious productions like THE KILLING FIELDS and EMPIRE OF THE SUN , arthouse flicks like BEING JOHN MALKOVICH and THE SHELTERED SKY and typical Hollywood blockbusters like IN THE LINE OF FIRE and CON AIR , but his performance as Lenny Small is absolutely irritating . He plays the role as if Lenny`s a victim of down syndrome who`s overdosed while mainlining prozac rather than the pathetic idiot of the book . Why can`t actors protraying idiots be subtle ? Producer / actor / director Gary Sinise may be to blame for this but since the scenes not featuring Lenny are at the very least competent I`ll lay all the blame at Malkovich`s door .Oh and before anyone gets confused I`ll point out the reason John Stienbeck`s novel OF MICE AND MEN is named thus is after a poem by Scottish bard Robert Burns : "" The best laid plans of mice and men most often go astray "" . It`s got nothing to do with the mouse Lenny holds in the start of the picture",Of Mice and Men
7,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,A guy don't need sense to be a nice fella,8,26 December 2009,"I haven't read the novel(with that said, it probably is superior to this, as is almost invariably the case), and when I first heard the title of this, I was actually expecting it to have originated as a play. Therefore, I can't comment on this as an adaptation of the source material. This is one of the only films that Sinise has directed, and I certainly see reason to give him more chances to do so. The plot is great, and though you can sort of figure out fairly early whether or not it will have a happy ending, it still holds surprises. This is about the lowest in society, and the lack of chances and tolerance that they must endure. The acting is excellent, although I understand that while Malkovich's performance makes Lennie come off as retarded, he was not as mentally debilitated in the book. With that said, he gives the role the gentle innocence that it needs. Every part is well-cast. The cinematography and editing are nice without drawing attention to themselves, and the well-written characters are what drive the compelling story forward. There is a little violence and disturbing content in this, some of it strong. I recommend this to anyone mature enough for it. 8/10",Of Mice and Men
8,Wuchakk,Steinbeck's classic book comes to life with Gary Sinise and John Malkovich,8,1 January 2016,"Based on the classic John Steinbeck novel and released in 1992, the story focuses on two traveling companions desperate for work in rural California during the Depression: George (Gary Sinise) is of average stature and smart whereas Lennie (John Malkovich) is big and mentally challenged. They get a gig at a big ranch while dreaming of owning their own one day when the opportunity suddenly presents itself. Unfortunately, the arrogant son of the owner, Curley (Casey Siemaszko), and his flirtatious wife (Sherilyn Fenn) complicate matters. John Terry is on hand as Slim, Ray Walston plays Candy and Joe Morton plays Crooks.I've been a fan of this potent Western drama/tragedy ever since I read the book as a teenager and both this version and the 1939 version are worthy film adaptions (I have yet to see the 1981 TV production with Robert Blake and Randy Quaid, which I've heard is good). It seems that you just cannot do a 'bad' ""Of Mice and Men,"" as long as you have decent actors and filmmakers.Some people scoff at the moral of the story, as if it all comes down to shooting your aged, useless dog yourself, but it's way more than this. It's a commentary on the nature of companionship and loneliness: Whereas George and Lennie compliment each other many of the other characters languish in isolation, like Candy, Curley's wife and Crooks, even Slim. Questions of strength, weakness, usefulness, reality and utopia are explored as the story leaves you scratching your head.Comparing the two versions, I slightly prefer the newer rendition because it's in color and is just overall better made with a superior score and cast with the exception of Lon Chaney as Lennie. Malkovich is very effective in the more recent version, but Chaney's Lennie is just more likable. While I don't like the addition of cussing in the 1992 rendition, it's probably more realistic and it isn't so bad that it makes the movie unwatchable (for me anyway). In any case, Sherilyn Fenn is a vast improvement over the original's Betty Field, who's annoying and not desirable enough to pull off the part (but, then again, she might be desirable to male ranch hands with no other females within a dozen miles).The film runs 115 minutes and was shot in California.GRADE: A-COMMENTARY***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read further unless you know the story)Curley's wife has only ever been valued for her sexuality, which she has learned to use to attract attention. Not only is she the only female character, she's also the only character not to be given a name in the book and the 1992 version, which emphasizes that she's a sexual plaything, currently owned by Curley. She was repressed by her mother and taken advantage of by men who made her empty promises. She prefers to believe that her mother stole her letters from the ""Hollywood"" man who used her, instead of accepting reality. She is married to a boor who places little value on her and so she seeks the only attention she can get from the men on the ranch as the only woman there: sexual attention. The contact with Lennie in the barn is as far as sexual as it gets. When she says ""It feels good"" to have her hair stroked, she isn't speaking sexually. She is enjoying the only nonsexual attention and affectionate touch she has had in a very long time, if ever. It is almost a meeting of children between this woman who long ago lost her sexual innocence but remains hopelessly naïve, and Lennie, who also longs for soft things in his life. It is a beautiful, tragic scene.Someone argued that Curley's wife wanted to get Lennie on her side so that he would kill Curley and she would be free to leave. If Lennie killed him, no one would believe him if he ever said that she told him to do it; and since she didn't do the deed herself, she could easily leave and start her life over, hopefully as a movie star. While an interesting theory, the young woman doesn't come across this devious or cunning in the story where her actions are more natural and naïve. Similar to Lennie, she was a child in an adult body, albeit not mentally challenged. She was starving for companionship, but none of the other men would hang out with her due to Curley and the threat of losing their job. Lennie was alone in the barn and so she just took advantage of the occasion to converse with someone. Add to this the fact that Lennie was the only man on the ranch to humble (conquer) her arrogant SOB husband, whom she hated. Plus, she noticed earlier how Lennie appraised her with obvious awe. So there was a subconscious attraction and she wanted the gentle giant to touch her, stroke her hair; perhaps to ""reward"" him.",Of Mice and Men
9,StevePulaski,A parable of friendship with dark undertones,9,15 December 2011,"John Steinbeck's novel Of Mice and Men is a misunderstood literary work of art. Because of its simple nature, many people don't look at it with a very broad focus. But who could blame them? It's a pamphlet at a little more than a hundred pages and doesn't boast its explicit and controversial nature. The novel is basically reiterating Steinbeck's biased opinions of communism and how the common-man will never succeed because of roadside distractions.This marks the third time this book has been adapted into a film, and the first time one has went theatrical. Gary Sinise's direction utilizes the ranch scenery not as a backdrop or a postcard, but to enhance the film and its overall look. Every bit is utilized and the scenic shots never seem intrusive or unwelcome. Sinise's direction is complimented by the writing from the amazing Horton Foote, who also wrote the screenplay to the 1962 adaptation of Lee Harper's novel To Kill a Mockingbird. The script is done with piercing accuracy to its book counterpart and doesn't adds or subtract anything from the novel, leaving it as Sinise's original intentions.The story is simplicity itself following the lives of charismatic and intelligent George (Sinise) and strong but slow Lennie (Malkovich) who are wonderful when side-by-side but incomplete on their own. It's The Great Depression era where everything comes in limits, and George and Lennie are migrant workers traveling from ranch to ranch seeking any kind of work and pay.They stumble upon Tyler Ranch, where they run into a barrage of unique characters like the elderly ranch-hand Candy (Walston), the pugnacious and easily-provoked tough guy Curley (Siemaszko) and his skimpy wife (Fenn) who remains nameless like in the novel. Soft-spoken Slim (Terry), blunt and confident Carlson (Riehle), and the hunchback stable-buck Crooks (Morton).George and Lennie desire to fulfill their simple goal of owning a farm, a home, chickens, and don't forget the rabbits Lennie so eagerly anticipates. But financial and social setbacks have been coming in their path left and right. They work their feet into the ground to be rewarded with aches and trouble, which is what The Great Depression era was mainly composed of.Gary Sinise plays an amazing George, and John Malkovich tackles the difficult role of Lennie efficiently. It's very challenging to put yourself into a character who isn't all there but isn't entirely what people would consider normal. Malkovich's physical appearance is pitch perfect, but he shows a struggle to remain in character and in his boundaries at times. The supporting cast is fantastic, especially Ray Walston as Candy and Sherilyn Fenn as Curley's wife.Like I stated before, the dialog is so on-par with Steinbeck's original masterpiece it's astounding. When comparing any movie to a book, people usually utter the misleading phrase ""the movie wasn't as good as the book."" You're comparing two different beasts. A film can never be all of the book, and what they did to Of Mice and Men was truly an amazement. They managed to create a film that left in mostly all of the subtleties of the original novel. Not only is it a rarity, but it's a true sign of respect for original source material.When George and Lennie talk to each other an on-screen spark ignites. The two characters, even in the novel, had inseparable chemistry together and it's incredibly difficult not to feel some emotion for them after the long road they've been on.Of Mice and Men is an extraordinary book and a film full of grace and charisma. It provided me with one of the more joyous experiences from such a sad film mainly because the actors are all blessed with beautifully written material and engulfing scenery. But I guess the real question we're left with is who is going to live off the fatta the land and tend all of those rabbits. Perhaps George will know the answer.Starring: Gary Sinise, John Malkovich, Ray Walston, Casey Siemaszko, Sherilyn Fenn, John Terry, Richard Riehle, Joe Morton, and Noble Willingham.",Of Mice and Men
10,Smells_Like_Cheese,Very good,10,3 December 2003,"""Of Mice and Men"" is one of my all time favorite books. I read it in high school and it was the first book I had a major interest in and read again and again after we finished it. The friendship of Lennie and George is so strong and inspiring. I think that's a reason I loved it, because my best friend and I could relate. We'd do anything for each other just like George would do for Lennie.The performances are jaw dropping good and I loved Gary Senise as George and John Malkovich as Lennie. You know that they started out in the Chicago theaters together first? Sorry, my Chicago pride slips in sometimes. John does something a little different with Lennie from the original black and white version and gives him more of a disgruntled voice with a lisp that sounds close to a child's. In some ways that was a good idea, because Lennie thinks like a child in some ways. But it wasn't that needed, Lennie was just a mentally challenged man, not speeched impaired.The plot is that Lennie and George are always on the run. Lennie always gets George in trouble because Lennie just doesn't know any better. Even though Lennie doesn't give George a break on life, you can tell he cares for him deeply and takes care of him. They go to a farm that is owned by Curly, played by Casey Siemaszko, to work for money and a place to live. They make friends with an elderly man, Candy who isn't well respected. He has an old dog with him that everyone is telling him to shoot because he's getting to old, and this was symbolic of what Candy was feeling, like just because the dog's old and useless, they should just get rid of him. When George, Lennie, and Candy are talking one night they talk about their dreams of going away to a potato field with rabbits for Lennie. This is it, they are going to go live their dreams. But when a flirty girl who happens to be Curly's wife keeps on going around the boys, she happens go to Lennie next where something terrible happens leading Lennie and George on the run again to an extremely powerful ending.This is a great movie and should be shown to everyone. I'm very serious on that because it has such a powerful message of strong friendship and loyalty. There are great performances and a great setting. I think John Steinbeck would be proud! 10/10",Of Mice and Men
11,MovieAddict2016,Simply Superb -- One of the Best Films of All Time!,10,13 February 2004,"Of Mice and MenAmazingly superb film based on the novel of the same name involves two Depression-era workers (Gary Sinise and John Malkovich) running away from the law and landing a decent-enough job at a ranch where they harvest crops and hay. Malkovich is amazing as the big, dumb, strong man who was ""kicked in the head by a mule as a kid,"" and Sinise--who also directed--proves here that he isn't only a terrific leading man, but also a wonderful director in the vein of classic films you just don't see anymore.

13,Robert_duder,Stunning and beautiful drama that everyone should see,9,1 January 2012,"Gary Sinise directs this brilliant and touching classic story about two depression era workers and their bizarre friendship and their lives. The film will literally bring tears to your eyes and touch you in every way a great drama should. Gary Sinise not only directs but stars and is brilliant as George Milton. And John Malkovich gives a breath taking award winning performance as the slow witted Lennie Smalls. The two of them together are brilliant, one of the best duos in film. The setting for the film is lovely and well directed and just all around a great movie! Ray Walston deserves honourable mention as a supporting character that has a truly great story that will leave you in tears as much as the main story does. If you want a great drama or want to see a classic come to life on screen this will not disappoint. It may not be as popular as other classic iterations but this is the definition of a gem. A truly great film worth seeing! 9/10",Of Mice and Men
14,paul2001sw-1,Of men and pain,7,12 October 2005,"John Steinbeck's depression-era story of decent George and his dumb friend Lenny is one of those tales almost too heartbreaking to bear a re-telling: a tragedy, in retrospect, of utter inevitability. Neither of its heroes have a malicious bone in their bodies, nor does their nasty boss Curly have any hope of moral redemption. This adds to the force of the ending, but also reduces the subtlety of the journey to reach it. But this is a decent adaptation and Gary Sinise and John Malkovich as the two men both put in good performances. I particularly like the way the camera picks out the whites of Sinise's eyes, which seems to emphasise the fact that this is a man committed to permanent, though ultimately fruitless, vigilance. But overall, there's a little too much unremittable pain to make watching 'Of Mice and Men' an entirely entertaining experience; you'll probably enjoy it more if you don't already know the story.",Of Mice and Men

17,eddie_baggins,A touching and well acted adaptation,8,8 June 2016,"It's never an easy task tackling an adaptation of a famed novel and revered writer John Steinbeck's oft talked about and well-loved title from 1937 Of Mice and Men is a risky proposition for the big screen with its deep themes, hard hitting examination of human nature and multilayered characters but all the way back in 1992 actor/director Gary Sinise (a face still perhaps best known from Forrest Gump and now sadly the TV series CSI: NY) alongside John Malkovich, helped turn Steinbeck's source material into a drama filled with heart, soul and against all odds, humour.Sinise's masterstroke of casting himself into the lead role of caring soul George Milton who takes ownership of Malkovich's hulking yet handicapped Lennie in the farming plains of America in the late 1920's/early 1930's helps bring Steinbeck's words to life with the two unlikely comrades enacting a banter and chemistry between each other that quickly brings the viewer into their worlds, both through the eyes of the driven George and the child like Lennie, who in many ways is but a small child trapped in the body of a stronger than he knows adult who's main concern is getting a puppy or tending to rabbits when indeed every day of his existence is threatened from more than one angle.Through these two fine actors we have access to two men we come to care for and relate to, Sinise has arguably never been better even though his role requires little flash while Malkovich's considered and measured turn as Lennie is quite the feat, which makes the fact his turn was largely ignored upon release quite mystifying. The two are ably supported by fine turns from side players Ray Walston as the aging yet loving Candy, Sherilyn Flynn as the hard done by wife of a farm owners son and farm hand Slim played by John Terry. With the actors on song in front of the camera, Sinise shows sufficient craftsmanship behind the camera while screenwriter Horton Foote delivers a hearty dose of emotional heft in a script jam packed with delivery of human kindness and the tough decisions that sometimes need to be made despite the hardship it will no doubt offer in the short-term.A fulfilling and quietly powerful adaptation of a loaded novel, Of Mice and Men stands up well against the test of time and makes one wish Sinise had in the years proceeding this film's release gone onto more memorable ventures behind the camera as well as in front of it and while the tricky subject matters may not be classed as entertainment in the typical sense, Of Mice and Men is a quality title deserving of its fine reputation by those that have discovered it as the years progress.4 dirty overalls out of 5",Of Mice and Men
18,ackstasis,"""There ain't many guys travel around together. I don't know why. Maybe everybody in the whole damn world's scared of each other.""",7,14 February 2007,"John Steinbeck's novel 'Of Mice and Men' is, along with his fellow masterpiece 'The Grapes of Wrath,' a classic of twentieth century literature. Brilliantly evoking time and place, Steinbeck masterfully recounted the tragic tale of George and Lennie, two friends who travel together and look out for each other during the Great Depression.Two-time director Gary Sinise (most popularly known for his memorable supporting role in 1994's 'Forrest Gump') has stated that 'Of Mice and Men' is his all-time favourite novel, and that he'd always wanted to adapt it to the screen. Sinise's respect for the work is clearly evident throughout the film, and screenwriter Horton Foote doesn't stray too far from the original story, nor does he overlook many vital plot points.George Milton (Gary Sinise) is a small but quick-witted farm labourer. He'd be doing considerably well for himself, but for his self-appointed obligation to look after Lennie Small (John Malkovich), a slow-minded giant. Lennie is a fine worker, but his insatiable, child-like curiosity often gets him into trouble, especially when he underestimates him own strength. After Lennie unintentionally harasses a women (because he was compelled to feel her beautiful red dress), he and George escape persecution and strike out  yet again  for new employment.Their search leads them to the Tyler Ranch, where they meet up with a whole new range of diverse characters, including the withered, one-handed old swamper named Candy (Ray Walston) and his equally withered dog, the kind-hearted Slim (John Terry), the crooked-backed African American stable boy, Crooks (Joe Morton), the easily-aggravated boss' son, Curley (Casey Siemaszko) and Curley's lonely and largely-ignored wife, who symbolically remains unnamed (Sherilyn Fenn). Each of these characters is well-acted by a strong supporting cast, and each of their qualities contribute significantly to the richness of the story.George often speaks about how Lennie is holding him back, but we can see that he generally enjoys his company. On most nights, Lennie insists that George recite a well-rehearsed speech about how lucky they are to have each other, culminating in a brilliantly evocative description of the ""little house and a couple of acres"" they are to purchase, in which they ""live off the fatta the land"" and Lennie will ""tend to the rabbits"" by feeding them freshly-grown alfalfa.""Guys like us that work on ranches are the loneliest guys in the world... They ain't got no family and they don't belong no place. They got nothing' to look ahead to... Well, we ain't like that. We got a future. We got somebody to talk to that gives a damn about us. If them other guys gets in jail they can rot for all anybody cares.""""But not us, George, because I... see, I got you look after me, but you got me look after you.""This is one of the most beautiful and touching friendships ever committed to screen, and we can almost see them succeeding in their goal, tending to their own farms as free men. Alas, John Steinbeck was not a writer known for his happy endings, and his heartbreaking conclusion has been translated well into the film. But perhaps the ending was slightly more optimistic than we initially think. They may not achieve their dream of living together on their own property, but neither of them have anything more to worry them. And that's all they really wanted.",Of Mice and Men
19,Coxer99,Of Mice and Men,10,25 March 1999,"Inspired pairing of Malkovich and Sinise as Steinbeck's classic Depression-Era characters.

20,ShootingShark,Beautiful And Evocative Screen Version Of Legendary John Steinbeck Drama,5,16 October 2005,"George, a smart little guy, and Lennie, a big dumb guy, are a couple of ranch-hands drifting around the countryside in thirties America. Due to his unusual size and simple mind however, Lennie has a penchant for getting into trouble. Things are looking up when they land a job harvesting wheat and befriend kindly old man Candy, as the three plan to throw in together and buy a little place of their own. Tragedy awaits however ...John Steinbeck's classic novel is an astonishingly powerful and moving story about loyalty, friendship and fickle fate, and is so well known that George and Lennie have become iconic character archetypes. This adaptation, brilliantly scripted by Horton Foote, and exceptionally well directed, was an obvious labour of love for star, co-producer and director Sinise, and his film is rich and passionate, filled with memorable scenes and performances. The lynchpin character is of course Lennie, and your reaction to the story is largely dependant upon your reaction to him. If you see him as a dangerously retarded brute then you might want to try getting yourself a soul; if you see him as a human being with an innate right to respect and dignity then this becomes a searing drama in which his death is one of the most shockingly profound moments in any story. The film has a trio of great performances; Sinise is us, an anchor of solid and rational sobriety, Malkovich is superb as Lennie, playing him as a child with a high-pitched voice but never overdoing it or shying away from his frustrating nature, and Walston has a great turn as the ageing Candy, who only wants to find some simple rest from a hard life. Don't miss Morton either, in a brief but telling role as the crippled stablehand Crooks, who briefly discovers through Lennie every man's fundamental need for companionship. Featuring a fantastic subtle score by Mark Isham, and shot in beautiful sun-splattered golden harvest locations in the Santa Ynez Valley in California, this is a tremendous film of a great book and a remarkable achievement for Sinise. Trivia - both Sinise and Malkovich learned their trade in a Chicago-based theatre-troupe called Steppenwolf, and the title comes from Robert Burns' poem, To A Mouse.",Of Mice and Men

22,a_chinn,The last film directed by Gary Sinise is one of the best films of the 1990s,10,26 November 2017,"Gorgeously filmed bit of Americana, although it's a rather dark vision American about of loneliness and the struggle to achieve the ""American Dream."" Director and star Gary Sinise, with screenwriter Horton Foote (who memorably adapted the 1962 film version of ""To Kill a Mockingbird""), craft a faithful adaptation of the John Steinbeck novel about two depression era drifters, George and Lennie. I won't bother summarizing the plot, as I'll assume anyone reading this has already read the book in middle school (or maybe you're a middle schooler watching the film instead of reading the book?), but Sinise is perfect as George, but the seemingly miscast John Malkovich as Lennie is surprisingly good in his role as well. Malkovich has never been a physically imposing presences on screen, which is one way he seems wrong for playing the hulking Lennie, and Malkovich is typically cast in sharp-tongues verbose roles such as ""Dangerous Liaisons"" or the villain in ""In the Line of Fire,"" but he does a wonderful job as the childlike Lennie. If I had to compare this performance to another of his, he did play a simple minded character in ""Making Mr. Right"" (along with a dual role as a more Malkovich-like of scientist). Ray Walston is the other standout in the cast as the old ranch hand Candy, who should have put down his own dog. Walston's role is a smaller one, but it's a particularly moving one from a veteran actor who's best remembered for his more comic of performances (""The Apartment,"" ""The Sting,"" or ""My Favorite Martian""), which really speaks to his talent. There really isn't a false note among any of the cast members, who include Casey Siemaszko, Sherilyn Fenn, John Terry, Alexis Arquette, Joe Morton, and Noble Willingham. These brilliant performances, elegant direction, and beautiful writing are complimented by one of composer Mark Isham's best scores (and that's saying something) and golden hued picturesque photography by Kenneth MacMillan. Overall, I'd rank Gary Sinise's ""Of Mice and Men"" among the best films of the 1990s and it's a crime the he hasn't directed a feature film since. FUN FACT! Walton's Candy is missing a hand and Walston is best known for playing Mr. Hand in ""Fast Times at Ridgemount High.""",Of Mice and Men
23,JuguAbraham,Amazing movie adaptation of a great book,8,27 May 2005,"Often a movie is associated with its actors or its director. I would associate this film more with Horton Foote the brilliant scriptwriter, who sculpted the script from a great book by a formidable author, John Steinbeck.When I read Steinbeck's book I was in awe of the author's powerful strokes of simplicity. Adapting the book into a screenplay can be formidable. Foote did it earlier with Harper Lee's novel ""To kill a Mockingbird"". He did it again in Beresford's ""Tender Mercies"". Some of the flashes of brilliance in the script are the opening sequence of the woman running scared into the camera, the opening and closing images of light falling on the dark insides of a train car, the empty bus ride that Steinbeck did not present. Director Gary Sinise and Foote made the adaptation of the novel on screen look easier by adding details just as scriptwriter Robert Bolt and director David Lean did the opposite by compressing the details with Pasternak's ""Doctor Zhivago"". Both ""Dr Zhivago"" and ""Of Mice and Men"" are great examples of adapting literary works for the screen.This is not to discount the contribution of Gary Sinise. Director Sinise and Actor Sinise were admirable. The former brought out the finest in the latter. This is Sinise's finest performance.Malkovich is a talented actor--he commands attention. Whether a more restrained performance was called for or not is debatable.Equally stunning is the film's music by Mark Isham--the man who grabbed my attention in ""Never Cry Wolf"", ""Mrs Soffel"" and ""A Midnight Clear"". Sinise was wise using the music effectively when required and not overdoing it to evoke pathos. The music doesn't sooth you, it nudges you to reflect on life.The film is a great essay on loneliness. Most importantly, it is a great example of how a literary work ought to be adapted without changing the author's vision. Remarkably, the film added more to Steinbeck's work with the train ride and the bus ride. That's Foote!",Of Mice and Men
24,OJT,Great film - Just as good as the book!,10,21 May 2000,Simple great. Told just like the book. No way of getting disappointed. Gary Sinise is becoming more and more of a favorite.

25,sme_no_densetsu,"A solid, faithful adaptation",8,28 May 2009,"""Of Mice and Men"", based on the classic novel by John Steinbeck, tells the story of two drifters sharing a bond and a common dream in depression-era California. Mentally-disabled Lennie often poses a burden to George, a man with plans of establishing his own homestead, but loneliness holds them together.The film marks a rare directorial effort by Gary Sinise, who also played the part of George. The film has an attractive look but lacks any distinct artistic touch to elevate it much above average in terms of presentation. The score, by Mark Isham, is also ably handled but not particularly noteworthy.Sinise & John Malkovich turn in fine performances in reprisals of the roles that they'd played together in a 1980 stage production. The rest of the cast is filled out with some recognizable character actors, all of whom turn in workmanlike performances.In the end, though, I suppose that it's inevitable to compare the film to the novel upon which it's based. I originally saw the film years before I read the novel and then saw it again only recently. The film is quite faithful to the source material, which is refreshing. However, while the book is one of my favorites, the film doesn't reach quite the same heights in its respective field. Nevertheless, it's a worthwhile adaptation and certainly worth checking out for anyone interested in the story.",Of Mice and Men
26,Rabical-91,The Best Laid Plans...,8,12 December 2015,"This film first came to my attention in 2006 when during an English class, we were to watch this film and then write an assessment on it. As a rebellious 15 year old, the film did not sound particularly appealing to me and I was convinced that within two minutes my concentration would start to drift elsewhere. However, to my surprise it turned to be a worthwhile and gripping venture, well served by its cast.Though not a fan of John Malkovich, or of Gary Sinise ( who also produced and directed the movie ), I liked the movie because of its heartwarming storyline, its thoughtful pace and grittiness.Based on the 1937 novel by John Steinbeck, this 1992 film adaption ( adapted by Horton Foote ) follows the lives of two men - George Milton and his mentally handicapped friend Lennie Small. The two have recently had to flee from their previous employment in California after Lennie was falsely accused of rape ( all he did was touch a woman's dress as he has a liking for stroking soft things ). Eventually, the two secure a job at Tyler ranch. Ranch hand Candy ( Ray Walston ) seems to take a shine to them, but Candy's son Curley ( Casey Siemaszko ) dislikes them on sight.The dislike soon turns to hatred when Lennie accidentally kills Curley's floozy of a wife ( Sherilyn Finn ) when whilst stroking her hair he accidentally grips too hard and ends up breaking her neck ( Lennie has no concept of how strong he is ). Angered by this, Curley rounds up a group of men with the intent on lynching Lennie. In a bid to spare Lennie from a slow, agonising death, George takes Lennie to a private spot in the countryside and distracts Lennie by talking to him about their dream of owning a ranch together before reluctantly shooting him in the back of the head.As the film ended, we had the boys of my class being too busy either sticking chewing gum under the chairs or engraving graffiti on the desks to take any notice of the film and we had the girls of my class crying their eyes out. I did not fall into either category. I sat there cool as a cucumber, feeling a strange sensation in the pit of my stomach ( it could have been indigestion from that day's school dinner ).The scene in which Candy's beloved but severely crippled sheep dog has to be anaesthetised, much to Candy's upset, I find a deeply affecting moment. It was about 14 years ago that my first dog ( who, if you can believe it, went by the name of Hannibal ) was put to sleep after losing his ability to see or walk. Even now, I still haven't entirely gotten over losing him so I know only too well the pain Candy must have been feeling.As another poster has said about this film, do not be afraid to show your emotions whilst watching it. Just sit with a box of tissues at the ready and let your emotions loose.",Of Mice and Men
27,emasterslake,Nearly as true as the book.,6,31 May 2006,"I've read the book and saw this movie. Course this is the only ""Of Mice and Men"" movie I've seen so far.The story takes place during the Great Depression. Two farm hands escape from their previous job due to an accident.One of them is a short guy named George who is the brains of the duo.The other is Lennie, tall and stupid, and has trouble remembering things.They're both traveling by train to find a new farm hand job.George looks after Lennie because Lennie wouldn't be able to take care of himself due to his condition. Lennie always ask George what they're going to do when they earn enough money. George tells him that one day they'll own a farm for themselves. But Lennie had a hard time remembering their goal.Lennie also has a bad habit of keeping mice that he accidentally kill. He just likes to pet them, but he doesn't it so rough it kills them. And Lennie has an obsession with Rabbits because he likes to pet them and pet anything that's soft.When they got a job at a farm George tries to tell Lennie that if he gets into trouble he must run and hide and wait for him(George) to tell him the coast is clear.The story is different from other Country/Farm related stories. It's Dramatic and has it's moments. The movie is very close to the original novel. Course there's tiny details that are different from the book. It's not too bad to read.Of Mice and Men is also believed to be the original to the common Smart and Stupid duos.Such as George and Jr. from the Tex Avery cartoons, Rocky and Mungsy from Looney Tunes, Ren and Stimpy, and any one who's large and dumb who resembles Lennie in a way.So if you get the chance see about checking out this movie or read the book.",Of Mice and Men
28,Beta_Gallinger,"A gripping adaptation of Steinbeck's story, much like the 1939 version",8,19 January 2010,"This was the adaptation of ""Of Mice and Men"" I was shown in late 2002, in one of my high school English classes, after we had read and studied the book. Just several weeks ago, still remembering the story very well, I finally watched the 1939 film for the first time, which is the first of two theatrically released adaptations of John Steinbeck's 1937 novella, and a very good one at that. I intended to watch this 1992 version (the second theatrical adaptation of the story) again after watching its predecessor, and that's what I did. Apparently, more than one TV adaptation was made in between these two films, and I haven't seen any of them, but I have now seen both theatrical versions, and even though one was made over fifty years after the other, they are both impressive.Lennie Small and George Milton are two ranch workers in Great Depression-era United States. Lennie is a mentally handicapped man of large stature and doesn't realize his own strength. He doesn't mean any harm, but still gets into a lot of trouble. George has to look after him and often has to get him out of trouble, and for this reason, they can't keep a job. They constantly have to move whenever Lennie gets in trouble and find work somewhere else, but the two of them dream of having their own house and acres of land. They find employment at Tyler Ranch, where they make friends with some of their co-workers, including an elderly man named Candy, but also face the ranch owner's mean-spirited son, Curley, who hates big guys like Lennie and has a neglected wife who is lonely and tries to be social, but George tells Lennie to stay away from her.The lead characters, Lennie and George, are played here by John Malkovich and Gary Sinise, and these two co-stars both really stand out, just like Lon Chaney Jr. and Burgess Meredith do in the 1939 version. Sinise also directed this film, and did a good job with that as well. Malkovich's portrayal of Lennie is very clearly different from that of Chaney, and some may criticize it for the stereotypical handicapped voice and such, but I would say both versions of the character are good in their own way, even if Chaney's is slightly better. One problem I found with this 1992 film is Sherilyn Fenn's portrayal of Curley's wife. I'm not sure exactly how to describe it, but it's slightly disappointing, and it seemed to me that the part where she is introduced could have been more focused. Betty Field's performance in this role in the first film is superior. However, most of the cast's performances here are still impressive, and as anyone who is familiar with the story would expect, this film is very poignant at times. I personally didn't find the part with Candy losing his dog as moving here as the way it was done in the first adaptation, but in the end, this second theatrical adaptation of the story basically leaves the viewer with the same emotions as the first one does.Which film is better, the 1939 version or this 1992 version? That's a tough call! Both films have their flaws, but are still very good and unforgettable, basically for the same reasons. They are also both very faithful to the book, even though they're obviously not exactly the same. The original adaptation of Steinbeck's classic MIGHT be better than this one by just a little bit, but if so, this film still comes VERY close to matching that one! It could have been far inferior, but fortunately, that didn't turn out to be the case. I wouldn't exactly call it a masterpiece, like some people do, but I think I can say it comes close, and I would describe its predecessor the same way. I don't know about the TV adaptations of ""Of Mice and Men"", which obviously aren't as widely available as the two theatrically released ones, but if you're a fan of the book, I really think the 1939 and 1992 versions of the story are both worth viewing.",Of Mice and Men
29,Stampsfightclub,Fine adaptation that thrills and shocks consistently,9,6 March 2009,"Lennie (Malkovich) and George (Sinise) head to a ranch to carry out work with a dream of one day owning their own land.Based on John Steinbeck's novel, Of Mice and Men is one of the classic dramas that creates controversy through a widespread use of real life difficult issues and is no surprise that it is of frequent use in English GCSEs. Written in a highly scripted and imaginative way with humour, drama and adventure, this is a timeless piece of literature that will go on and on and recall issues that were present in the depression that are remerging in recent times with the credit crunch and lack of work and money in particular. Opening with a woman running away we see Lennie and George also running away and this slow motion montage juxtaposed with the light score brings you into a trance like state as the characters make their way out of hiding and off to work. Lack of jobs, taking whatever work is offered, little money and no place today might sound like a description of this past year but here we see how it was equally difficult in the depression. It is through George that we get a real sense of how things have been. George is a negative middle aged guy wanting to settle down and has a burden to bear with Lennie. Lennie's child like manner has him an outcast from places and when reaching the ranch we see how Lennie is an instant outcast with his way of being. But through George we see how tolerable he really is and how the lack of work and life changes can affect the human spirit.Of Mice and Men is more than just a drama however. The symbol of appearances, the use of money, the good nature of strangers and the importance of friendship are all covered. Again all issues that are still present in today's culture that is all relative. Malkovich and Sinise give great performances and it is down to the script that makes the stars shine in the way they do with particular moments such as Lennie's animal loving in particular mesmerizing.Sinise's artistic direction works wonders with the motions of the story. Of Mice and Men is a fine adaptation that lacks only on the odd turn but thrills, spills and shocks on a consistent basis and with the multitude of life problems, this is a fine preaching drama",Of Mice and Men

33,oshram-3,A brilliant vision,10,13 August 2007,"Most of you are probably familiar with the plot from when this book was forced upon you in high school; George and Lenny are wandering laborers in the 20s/30s. George is a pretty sharp guy, but Lenny is mentally handicapped; a giant of a man, he is a phenomenal worker, but his mental and emotional shortcomings continually land the two men in hot water. When they end up at a particular ranch in Salinas, the men encounter trouble that no amount of running away will solve.Steinbeck's book is particularly depressing (as I find the works of many early 20th century American authors to be), and the movie captures that exceptionally, without making it a depressing experience to view. Steinbeck's themes of loneliness, of the harshness of life, of how unfair things can be, are all carried over into the film adroitly; but Sinise manages to capture the beautiful California landscape, and in particular that golden sunlight, to at least add a veneer of beauty to the disheartening proceedings.The acting is uniformly excellent here. Sinise's George is world-weary, cautious, and protective of Lenny; he understands his burden fully and as in the book curses his relationship with Lenny even while we know it is an obligation he will never willingly forsake. The bit parts are all fine as well, with Sherilyn Fenn playing Curley's Wife to perfection; Ray Walston is wonderfully low-key as the lonely, used-up Candy; and Joe Morton as Crook only gets one scene, but he runs the gamut from anger to fear to camaraderie and loneliness, shifting effortlessly in the space of a few minutes. But really, even with all the fine performances, the movie is Malkovitch's. I've never been a huge fan of his work, but he is perfect here as Lenny; he captures the man's childlike worldview, his instant joy in small things, his fear of being stranded by George, and even Lenny's anger just perfectly. Watching Malkovich in this movie is watching a master at the top of his craft; Lenny instantly catches the viewer's sympathy, and Malkovich makes it obvious why George is both irritated by and yet loves the big lunk.The last scene (I won't spoil it, in case you have forgotten or never read it) is one of the classics of cinema, I feel. The emotion is so powerful, yet so subtly played by both actors; you know what must happen, what George must do, and yet, even as he steels himself to the task, we can see how difficult it is for him. At one point Senise bows his head, eyes screwed shut, on Malkovich's shoulder; this small gesture speaks volumes about the bond between the two men, about everything that Steinbeck was trying to say about love and friendship, and loneliness. It sums up the whole book, the whole film, in an instant. Simply put, this is a brilliant adaptation, well worth your time to investigate.",Of Mice and Men
34,Paynebyname,Just a really poor film,3,24 November 2020,"SPOILERS
For many years, there was something about this film that I wasn't sure about. I don't know if it was a trailer or a review but I'd always steered clear of it but after a solid recommendation, I gave it a go.I should have trusted my gut, for it is an uncomfortable and unlikeable film. I've seen and enjoyed many films about people with mental health problems - Rain Man, Forrest Gump, Peanut Butter Falcon etc - but these all have something endearing and likeable about the characters. Yes, they've been dealt an unfair hand but they usually have some humanity within them that as an audience member you can relate to. That was not present in this film.None of the characters are likeable. Lenny is unhinged, weird and dangerous. It's patently obvious from the beginning that he isn't a 'gentle giant' or a benign character. You don't feel compassion for him or his fate, you just feel fear and unease because you can sense what he is capable of.And this isn't me being uncharitable as it is clearly a choice by the actor and director that whenever he sees a woman, Lenny start looking sheepish and grabbing his crotch area, exhibiting the kind of mannerisms that makes it patently obvious that there is an underlying sexual angle to his behaviour.For this reason, the lack of compassion also extends to George. I'm sorry but knowing what Lenny is capable of means that George is responsible and culpable for Lenny's actions. Lenny is clearly a ticking time bomb and hence you have to charge a duty of care to the guy who knowingly leaves a time bomb unattended.In Rain Man, Raymond slightly changes but it is Charlie that completely changes. There is character growth and Charlie grows because he learns to protect and love his brother. Although Raymond can be draining, his idiosyncrasies are endearing and Charlie gets something back from his developing relationship with Raymond.Likewise in Peanut Butter Falcon, Shia's character doesn't know it but he is looking for someone to look after to replace how his brother looked after him. There is shared affection and each character gets something back from the other and in turn develops because of their connection to each other.This doesn't exist in Of Mice and Men. George doesn't change, Lenny doesn't change and neither brings joy to the other person. Lenny isn't an anchor that despite the extra hardship still makes George happy, he is simply a dangerous volatile individual.Likewise George isn't a protector. When Lenny is getting beaten up by the Ranch owner's son, George doesn't step in to break up the fight or start fighting himself, he actually eggs on Lenny. He knows that Lenny cannot control his emotions, his temper or his strength yet he grandstands over a situation that everyone can see is going to end badly.And then finally with the frustrated wife, it seems that there is almost some kind of victim blaming going on. Yes, she was lonely and frustrated and would be all manner of bad news to any guy in that situation but come on, she didn't deserve to die. She goes from potentially flirting with Lenny to getting her neck snapped in another situation whose outcome was clear to see.And once Curly's wife has been killed, what are the audience meant to feel? I don't feel sorry for Lenny because it wasn't an accident. She struggled to escape, he could feel her panic, we saw the anger on his face and whether overtly intentional or not, he crushed her. He knew what he was doing during the tussle and he knew what he had done when he ran off. It wasn't an accident, he didn't swing round a ladder and knock her off a fence - he killed her with his own hands.Likewise I don't feel sorry for George. He effectively left a loaded shotgun in a nursery full of children and walked away to play hoops. Given Lenny's possible diminished responsibility, George's hands have the blood of the woman on them.And hence by the time they get to the river bed, I don't feel sympathy for Lenny or for George. Lenny gets an escape via the bullet to the head but what about George's penance for the death of an innocent woman?I have to say that this really belongs in that category of films that everyone tells you is great and a real classic and it truly isn't. Is it the fault of Gary Sinise or is the book just like this, either way it isn't special or a classic and if anything is a really, clumsily told and unsympathetically written tale. Lenny isn't the Gentle Giant that the write up would have you believe but a dangerous man-child that would generate nightmares rather than sympathy in most normal people. I have to say that Frank Darabont/Stephen King did far better with what is obviously an homage to Of Mice & Men with The Green Mile, than Steinbeck ever did. Very poor and wildly over-rated.",Of Mice and Men
35,nmholland,"Better Than Expected, Yet Not The Best",7,2 May 2016,"Of Mice and Men is directed by and stars Gary Sinise. Sinise plays George, a man living in California during the 1930's Great Depression. George is a homeless man that goes from job to job trying to earn any scrap of money to survive. However, George's situation is a little different than most; he travels with a close friend with a mental disorder named Lennie (John Malkovich). George and Lennie eventually come to work at a ranch, and that's where our story starts.I watched this film very soon after finishing the novel, and was pleasantly surprised. I was expecting for this movie to be awful, but it was actually pretty good. Most of the acting was nice, the direction was good, and the script was actually really great. Most of the lines in the script were either taken straight from the book, or were very close to it. Of Mice and Men was a pretty good movie, and I quite enjoyed it.The best thing about this film adaptation was the script, like mentioned above. The script was very faithful to the novel, and many lines were exact copies of what John Steinbeck, the author of the book, wrote. The book being only around 100 pages, the film knew it was going to have to lengthen itself, and it did so very well. The scenes added were pretty insignificant, and were mostly time fillers, as they should have been. The script did just about everything right, and I really liked that aspect of the film.Another pretty nice thing about Of Mice and Men was the acting. Gary Sinise was a perfect casting choice as George, and played the role nicely. All of the smaller actors, such as Ray Walston as Candy, were good as well. Most of the acting was really good all throughout the movie. Now, John Malkovich was good as Lennie, but played the role of a man with mental issues a bit too well. Although he wasn't bad by any means, he went a little overboard with his performance. When reading the novel, it was quite obvious that Lennie had issues, but he still seemed like he could at least hide his problems, as he does in the book. However, John Malkovich's performance showed him as a man beyond even recognition. His performance, while decent, went a bit farther than I feel that it should have.Gary Sinise, while great as George, also did great behind the camera as the director. All of the shots taken were pretty nice, and all of the camera angles were really good. Many of the takes were longer, and there were no quick cuts at all. However, I did have a complaint that was mostly with the direction, and that was the suspense build up. Although the direction was good, tension wasn't present very often. There were only two points throughout the film that I felt suspense, and that was because I had already read the book and knew what was about to happen. With my prior knowledge of the major plot points, I felt suspense. However, if I hadn't already have known the next big event in the story, then I don't think that I would've felt the tension almost at all.Of Mice and Men was overall a decent movie, and respected the novel. The script was great, the direction was fine, and most of the acting was good. I'd recommend Of Mice and Men to anyone who's read the book and enjoyed it.",Of Mice and Men

37,eyesour,Worth watching. Once,6,26 September 2011,"It must be at least 50 years since I read Steinbeck's novella, and it stays with one. But there is still something off-putting about it, and I don't think I ever re-read it. I don't think I'll be re-watching this movie, either. Yes, both story and movie are moving and touching. They are also highly depressing, and have a sort of ugly fascination about them, rather than being enjoyable or impressive.This film adaptation is very faithful, if I remember the original rightly, although there may be a few adjustments here and there. Someone else has mentioned, however, that Malkovich doesn't seem quite right as the big lunk-head. He's too intelligent, and it's permanently distracting to watch him act dumb. This Lennie just isn't fully credible, and I kept catching myself distancing myself from the performance, watching it in a sort of bemused way. What was this man's mental age meant to be? I have a six year old grandson who is way brighter: Lennie seemed to have a mental age of about 2 and a half. At the same time it was all too obvious that Malkovich has an IQ well above average. He was just pretending, and that's not good acting. Also, I don't believe he's really that big and strong, and I kept asking myself how the visual appearance was being manipulated. I just knew he didn't have the strength not to know what it was. It was not convincing, though I can't think who would have been better. Primo Carnera would have been good, but he wasn't available. Same goes for the guy who played Moose Malloy to Mitchum's Philip Marlowe.It is understandable that this effort was respected by critics, but I can't see it being recommended from one average viewer to another, and it's equally understandable that it bombed at the box-office.

39,pettyfog,Should be shown in EVERY h.s. lit class,9,21 May 2000,"If ever a movie lived up to a standard of literature for the contemporary American art form, this is it. When you watch this you'll be stunned at how easy it should be to adapt a novel .. but it's seldom done right. You'll NEVER find a truer adaptation than this.. in fact you'll swear it's not ""adapted"" at all.Everyone else in this group has already given the accolades.  I second them.",Of Mice and Men
40,Junker-2,"Tell me about the rabbits, George...",9,25 March 2000,"I put off watching this movie for many years. I figured, what was the point? I had read the book ""Of Mice and Men"", watched earlier movie versions and seen it performed on stage. Why sit through yet another version? Finally one day at the video rental store I decided to take a chance and rent it. I am very, very glad I did.So why sit through another version? Because it is extremely well done. Gary Sinise and John Malkovich are powerful in the leads, Sherilyn Fenn has never been more appealing and Ray Walston will break your heart.This is just plain good storytelling and good movie making. I guess like Lennie never getting tired of hearing George talk about the rabbits, I'll never get tired of seeing a good version of this classic story.",Of Mice and Men
41,theskylabadventure,Lovely but miscast,7,22 May 2006,"I must admit, I approached this film with caution. After a long chat with an old friend about the book, I thought I'd check it out, expecting to be sorely disappointed.In fact, I felt quite the opposite. Gary Sinise is one of the most underrated actors in American cinema, and is pretty well suited to this role. It came as no surprise then that his performance was beautiful, and truly the heart of the film. It therefore seems fitting that he also directed it. By no means do I wish to suggest any vanity on his part, only that he knew exactly what he wanted to do with this movie, and he did it wonderfully. It is perfectly paced, and what little is omitted from the book is not damaging. It is also beautifully shot.The casting is very good on the whole, despite Ray Walston and Casey Siemaszko playing a little too close to stereotype. Sinise himself is typically superb. There is, however, on exception; the usually brilliant John Malcovich.I love Malcovich's work, but was particularly wary of him playing Lenny in this movie. It was just plain wrong. He seems uncomfortable (and I don't mean he's acting it) with what he had to do to such an extent that Lenny just came off as a two-dimensional caricature - which is an outrage given the subtle brilliance of Steinbeck's writing of him.It's not Malcovich's fault. If blame must be laid it should really be on Sinise for not seeing it and/or not doing anything about it. Having said that, if I were making a movie and had a chance to have John Malcovich in it - I'd have him in it! He's just wrong for this part in my opinion and, sadly, lets an otherwise beautiful film down.",Of Mice and Men

No wonder Gary Sinise has made progress after this film.",Of Mice and Men
43,Bon_Jovi_chick,A Beautiful film,10,24 June 2002,"The first time I saw this film was back in High School when I was 12. Even now, years later, I still think its a beautiful film which cannot fail to move and is guaranteed to bring out emotions of the audience. Gary Sinise directs it brilliantly and is great as the smart George.Although visually, I think John Malkovich was brilliant as Lennie, I think he may have gone a bit over the top on the simplicity of Lennie. At times, he made Lennie seem retarded rather than the child-like man he is described in the book.This film sticks incredibly well to the book. Okay, some scenes are added and some are edited or cut completely from the film but it still keeps to the theme of the film. It is about two men who have nothing but each other and a dream to own their own land and live their ""American Dream"", a dream that keeps them going through the Great Depression of 1930s America.As well as the film, I would also recommend the book. Its not regarded as one of Steinback's best for no reason. I find it to be more simpler than any other than Steinbeck's work for one thing. It deserves to be seen as one of the best. And this film does the book justice!!!! Id give it a 10/10",Of Mice and Men
44,phantopp,Might be better if you read the book,5,18 September 2009,"Two men, one mentally disabled (John Malkovich), the other (Gary Sinise, who also directed the movie) who swears to take care of the simple, but physically powerful man.The two begin working on a farm, where ""Lenny"" (Malkovich) struggles to behave, as well as to try to remember that he has to be gentle as to not hurt anybody or anything since he is more physically gifted than mentally. All the while, ""George"" (Sinise) tries to put himself between ""Lenny"" and those around him to protect his traveling companion.Based on the John Steinbeck book, of which I did not read, this is actually a pretty good movie with some pretty strong performances.In fact, the performances are the only reason to watch this movie. The entire cast is near perfect. Malkovich and Sinise has pretty good chemistry as the two lead characters. Personally, I liked Sinise better than Malkovich, neither of which are my favorite actors.There are also some strong performances from various members of the supporting cast. However, it appears that many of them were not given a lot to work with.If you have not read the book, you may not think that the supporting cast was given much. I didn't think so either since I've never read the book. Personally, I would have liked to have seen a few of the supporting characters more.There is some good chemistry with this cast, some better than others. You can really see where the chemistry was best by the scenes with the strongest performances.The soundtrack is completely lacking in this film. In fact, I think I remember only one piece of music near the end of this film. And it sounded like they turned the volume down on that little piece of music that is completely forgettable.The wardrobes, and other period pieces seen in this film, looks very authentic. It didn't appear that they tried to make it look like period clothing, it looked pretty authentic. They even went as far as making the clothing look like they were worn for some time, with little washing.There is no spectacular camera work in this film. There are a couple of foot chases in here with some quick editing. The lighting is used well, and the angles are done nicely. There's just nothing memorable in any of the shots.If you are looking for action, there isn't any worth looking for. This is pure drama, with no explosions or gun play.Maybe because I never read the book, I kept looking away from my computer screen (I watched it on Hulu) because I was getting bored. If you haven't read the book, the only reason to see this is for the performances.There is no reason to see this movie except for the performances. In fact, I didn't even know it existed until it came up on my Hulu recommendations list. I am more familiar with the Lon Chaney, Jr./Bergess Merrideth version. This movie is only worth seeing once.I do suggest that you read the book so you know what is going on. In fact, you may like it better if you familiarize yourself with the source material first.",Of Mice and Men
45,Randy_Dreammaker,It's a good story about a bad story,6,30 August 2019,"Having never read the book and seeing it for the first time almost twenty-eight years after its release, I can only approach this movie from the perspective of a filmmaker and audience participant.Everything about 'of Mice and Men' from a film and production value is great, for the most part, the story and transitions are smooth but several bump points are really harsh.I wasn't certain exactly sure how this story was going to unfold, and the fact that I am watching it in 2019, a time is US History where any use of the N-Word, historical or otherwise by anyone who isn't black, it seemed a little to close to the triggers of the political culture of this generation. At the same time, it did help set the historical time line that the story was supposed to have occurred in.This film left me unsure of how to feel about it as a whole, and that is very rare. I like the story's focus on friendship and commitment to friendship which even plays out in its final act. At the same time there is a part of me that just didn't care by the time it wrapped up.I think my ambivalence towards the conclusion was at least in part due to the lack of empathy and numbness of the character George towards the actions of his friend. The set-up that occurred with the dog that was put down earlier also seemed numb, unsympathetic, and callous.This set-up for the resolution with the putting down of the old dog really seemed out of place, a harsh ""bump point"" of story transition, it seemed forced.It isn't until the final scene and how it unfolds that I made the connection of this part of the story, in which, unlike the old man who allowed someone else to put down his old dog and then regretted it, George makes a similar decision.These two parts of the story are its worst points for me, because they force a moral decision about life and death, the value of life, the influence of others choices on life and death and whether or not those with mental challenges should be accountable for their actions.Ultimately, I came away simply not caring at all about this story, its attempt to force moral conclusions and outcomes and its sense of empathy.",Of Mice and Men
46,MovieCritic20497,A Wonderful Remake,8,1 February 2003,"This is one of the greatest films I have ever seen. John Malkovich does a fantastic job playing Lennie. Also, I loved the ending of the film.

47,Filmcritic624,Pretty Film,9,29 April 2005,"This movie was absolute genius to Gary Sinise's part, and probably one of the better portrayals after a book than any other book I have read.John Malkovich is absolutely outstanding as the role of neurological impaired Lennie Small. His smile, and enjoyable role make you want to watch this movie more closely than ever before, and lights up the big screen with hard working perseverance. An absolute life-saver.I could have lived without Slim, who wasn't nearly as good and didn't exceed my expectations, or Candy, who didn't seem to have the role down well, were some downsides.But some upsides were plenty! George (Sinese) and Lennie (Malkovich), are absolutely perfect together, they simply look like they would stay together forever. Curley's Wife is portrayed in simple fashion, just as good as it was thought, and made the movie much more serious.I wouldn't change the film one bit, except see it for yourself.9/10 stars.",Of Mice and Men
48,amanbirsingh,Touching!,9,5 October 2020,"Based on John Steinbeck's 1937 novel of the same name, Of Mice and Men is Gary Sinise's only directorial project till date, who also stars in its lead role.Set in the Prairies (California) during the depression, the film revolves around the friendship between two marginalized farm-hands seeking work on a 'White' ranch, one of them a paraplegic played by John Malkovich.While trying to stay out of trouble with the local farmers, the duo try and keep to their dream of becoming landowners themselves, going on about it in their rhapsodies and merry rhymes.Sherilyn Fenn plays a simple but lost girl, the daughter of the ranch-owner, away from the big, noisy and rich cities where life is more real and satisfying. She expresses these regrets and that more than once.Unfortunately, one ugly thing leads to another, fights break out, and all dreams turn to nightmares. A tragic tale that seems to emphasize the hapless and miserable condition of the weak and poor in a touching manner.The film is treated with a mature hand and that shows in its careful pace. Though it takes time with some scenes, the screenplay is fluent and flowing. A brilliant film with few weaknesses, it should be watched with attention to derive more from it.",Of Mice and Men
49,DoctorStrabismus,Great dramatisation of a very great classic,10,10 August 2017,"Let's start out by saying that I am a huge Steinbeck fan. I have read just about all of his work, and many books several times over. I have visited his family home and the museum to him in Salinas, and also Monterey and Cannery Row on three occasions, and that's a long way from Australia.So I expect a lot from any dramatisation of a Steinbeck novel, and I found it with this movie. I missed it at the time of its release, principally due to my own personal dramas way back then, and had forgotten all about it until I saw it in the list of movies on a long-haul flight this week, so I had to see it.Of course I knew everything that was going to happen, but the movie led me carefully along that path, and each phase was revealed with due finesse, perhaps most of all the story of Candy's dog, which was acted with such brilliance.Unlike the rather sad American woman who reviewed it on here as ""terrible"" simply because it didn't have a happy ending (and I have ticked ""spoiler alert"" just in case that gives anything away - and she even criticised Steinbeck for not writing a novel which ended in ""happy ever after"") I think it came close enough to perfection for ten points.",Of Mice and Men
50,pro-andy,one of the best ever,9,9 January 1999,I think this movie is one of the best movies that ever has been made. Gary Sinise and John Malkovich are both great in this movie. When you have seen this movie you just think about it all day.I´ll give it 8 of 10.,Of Mice and Men

52,glennsmithk,Far from what Steinbeck created.,4,8 November 2019,"Sinese made a valiant attempt at capturing Stienbeck's story, but he missed the mark. The mood is wrong. The cinematography is breathtaking, with vivid colors, perfect depth of field, amazing lighting, and deeply moving landscapes. That's the first problem. It's a tragic story. The mood set by it's appearance would have had much more impact had it been bleak and darker. Secondly, Malkovich is a clown. His portrayal of Lennie is nothing like the book's character. Watch the stream scene again where he spits water on George. It's forced, likely ad-libbed, and simply ridiculous. Malkovich probably thinks everyone with mental illness acts like that. His in-character voice is just as bad, silly and inauthentic.Seniese had an opportunity to create a masterpiece. Instead, he cast it poorly, filmed it to look like a travel documentary, and sought to appeal to the average viewer who had likely never read the book or ever will. Maybe this is why Sinese only directed two feature films. He's a good man. His foundation does terrific work. But his portrayal of Of Mice and Men is not worthy of its Stienbeck roots.",Of Mice and Men

I will always remember this as the first movie I walked out on before it was over. That idiot freak kills the one girl (Sherilyn Fenn) that doesn't deserve it, and that was it for me. Turned me down so much that I couldn't bring myself to be interested in the rest of the story. The two are not the actors (or characters) one can sympathize with. So drunken men cause a lot of mischief, accidents happen, retards are stupid, and brother has problems dealing with his difficult relative. Hope does not make it better. Oh, and: yeah, reality pretty much stinks. Tell us something we don't already know.It was years later when I finally saw the rest of the movie on TV, out of boredom mostly, only to discover I was right about my predictions on how the rest of the story would be.

55,miagy,The Steinbeck's masterpiece by the eye of a camera - I like it,9,18 March 2005,I suppose there is no need to write something about the story because everyone has had to read the book ( but what is weird - me not) or just has known the storyline before. So it is clear that we are talking here about a real deep not-empty tale. As I 've wrote I cant compare the book with the film but I liked the movie much.Really well played character by Malkovitch whose playing looks to me similar to acting in the movie The Man On The Moon by Forman - Andy Kaufman. His speaking the most.And writing about scenes and story telling I cant say a wrong word about that. Nice locations with almost smellable corn during watching - wonderful. So in the end I have to recommend this piece both to admires of Steinbeck and to people who want to experience and enjoy the pure American country during the harvest :-).,Of Mice and Men
56,panicwatcher,Great except for Malkovich,7,14 September 2003,"This movie has a good script, fine acting, and is beautifully photographed. Even though I had read the book and knew the plot, I was drawn into story and moved by the ending.  Gary Sinise does a very good job of showing what a complicated and conflicted character George is.   George seems to be a smart man, but he has not gotten far in life.  He feels the need to watch out for his closest friend, Lenny.  But, you sense that George sometimes thinks Lenny is a burden and George feels guilty about those thoughts.  This might be Gary Sinise's best acting performance. I was disappointed in John Malkovich's over-the-top portrayal of Lenny.  In the book, I felt that Lenny was just very simple minded, but in the movie version, Lenny seems to be seriously retarded.  The Malkovich Lenny has too many odd facial expressions and a speaking style that is like a cartoon parody Lenny.  That performance was distracting and irritating and made Lenny less sympathetic.  It also changed the relationship with George.  It makes George more of a nursemaid to seriously ill Lenny, instead of a helpful friend who watches out for Lenny.",Of Mice and Men

I'm not quite sure why this one of the most powerful adaptations from a book.  Perhaps the steps from book to play to screenplay gave it enough time to find it's pace and voice. I would have loved to have seen it on the stage with the same cast. Absolutely wonderful.  I even have a new found respect for Ms. Finn.  The two leads are exceptional, but I expected that, it was the easy grace of all the characters becoming alive that moved me. The book is a great book, but I always thought the other characters were just too shallow.  Gary Sinise and the supporting cast breathe a life into these people.  You've met them before.  Been fishing with them.   Fought with them. Just a Wonderful film.  I hear a lot of talk about ""chick flicks"".  Well, this very much may be a ""dick flick"" if they exist.

I waited four hours until the man brought it back to make sure I got it. Wow was it worth waiting for! I have not seen any movies lately that were so full of heart and love. Sinise and Malkovich BOTH play amazing roles in this film. I've seen it 5 times and everytime I cried at the dramatic ending. It shows how cruel and yet how loving people can be. This movie has a great mix of everything I think anyone could enjoy. I cannot believe I had never heard of this film before looking up info on Gary Sinise. This film should be a classic.

63,kevin-h-720-45317,Lenny ....get him!,9,12 December 2016,Having read this book at school I revisited it again forty years later and was reminded how powerful it was in its simple telling. Having finished the book I decided to see what films had been made in its image and found this 1992 adaption and quickly settled down to watch it.Having read the book and watched the film adaption within about 24hrs I quickly saw what a perfect mirror it was from book to film. The film is true to the text and does not divert hardly. Mostly what I visualized in the book was manifest in the film. The dialogue seems verbatim and its quality is delivered well by its cast. I personally think the characters of George and Lenny are played exceptionally well by Gary Sinise and John Malkovich. If your a fan of the novel by Steinbeck you will not be disappointed by this visual piece.,Of Mice and Men
64,bpstraycat,A successful film that gives rise to many of questions,8,17 June 2006,"If you feel like sitting down and watching something thought-provoking without becoming too 'Peter Greenaway', then have a look here - a sound and 'safe' story of a man with a mental disability and his friend. The film deals with some very deep subjects. Social attitudes are displayed but not analysed. The only black character in the film is discriminated against more than the mentally-deficient white man. At the time of the writing of Stenibeck's novel (1938) this was a far more relevant message than it is today. Malkovich is excellent in the role of the main character: his portrayal elicits both sympathy and understanding from the audience in the face of homicidal brutality. In isolation, this is a worthy piece of work and should have had a lot more recognition than it received. As an adaptation of a novel written when the world was a very different place, it is a true and fine reflection of attitudes of the time.Here ends to review of the film. Now begins a wider topic:I am sure the 1938 novel was ground-breaking in its treatment of a handicapped person as a real human being. At that time, for whatever reason, Steinbeck decided that his main character should in fact turn out to be a murderer. Civilisation has moved on since then, however, and just as the prejudice shown towards to black character is unthinkable today, then so should be the tendency in the cinema to portray mentally handicapped people as dangerous psycopaths.In the context of many other movies that deal with mental disorder, this is yet another story of a 'very gentle' maniac who wins our sympathy but ultimately never our trust. Look at 'Slingblade','Cuckoos Nest' and a lot of other 'understandable lunatic' films and you will see that although the audience is invited to identify and condemn the injustice that society delivers to the mentally ill, the carpet is pulled from under them because the handicapped person they are just getting to know and to understand and sympathise with turns out to be a darkly negative character, thus reinforcing the prejudices the audience had when they entered the movie theatre. This is an insidious and even dangerous trend. Why bother to lead people up a blind alley? When is Hollywood going to grow up and realise that most people suffering from mental disorders are not homicidal and are on the contrary highly valuable human beings. When will there be a truly credible and positive mentally-retarded lead character on the screen who does not end with his hands in a bath of blood? I am not talking about 'comic-book retards' like Forest Gump or the proto-lunatics (no pun intended) living on K-Pax. Mentally deficient people are not all murderers. 'Of Mice and Men' is a film showing attitudes from 80 years or so ago. As such it an engaging and positive work. Film makers who deal with modern scripts set in the present should not resort to the prejudices of 80 years ago.",Of Mice and Men

Curley's wife was the breaking point - a mixture of hot and cold in a kind. Chaos, as George predicted. She made the most tender creature turn into a violent machine even though both wanted the same thing.All the characters in the movie just wanted to be understood. Not to be alone. The old man losing his dog, the black man separated in his room, even the villain, Curley, did not want anyone else to take his wife.A must see for some beautiful landscape and detailed image on how it was in the countryside.",Of Mice and Men
66,Javin,Simply beautiful.,10,5 September 2001,"It's not often that you stumble across a movie that you'd never heard of, and find that it should truly be a classic.I only found this movie recently, and figured it was a quiet remake of the original (and horrible) 1939 version.  At first, I wouldn't have given it a second glance, since I absolutely LOATHE movies that destroy the original book (Can we say Starship Troopers, anyone?) but then I noticed that it was Malkovich and Sinise.  I figured this was an interesting match, so decided to pick it up.  It was the best move I ever made.It takes a lot for me to truly think a movie deserves a full 10, but this movie truly does.  I was extremely shocked to see the low score on it, in fact.  There's approximately ONE scene (and an appropriate one, I think) that doesn't follow the book's original storyline line by line.  The acting was superb, the directing equally as fantastic, and the story made me feel like I was reading the book for the first time again.I was absolutely shocked to find that the movie was over 8 years old, and that, even worse, it's not released on DVD!  Despite the fact that you'll have to use VHS (which for a movie you'll want to watch over and over, this is a bad thing) I'd strongly suggest buying yourself a couple of copies, and sitting down with a LOT of popcorn, and a few boxes of tissue.If you're looking for action, thriller, comedy, suspense, or ANYTHING other than a classic drama, you probably shouldn't try this movie.  However, if you're wanting to see the epitome of drama beautifully done in a classic story about true love and friendship, and the pain of just being human, this movie is for you.",Of Mice and Men

The characters were just the way I pictured them when I read the book and are truly third-dimensional. This is a great movie to watch if anyone wants to get away from the unoriginal, generic, big-time Hollywood movies and just watch a brilliant, emotionally driven film about two ordinary men with a dream in their hearts.

Of Mice and Men"" falls into that category. As does ""Stagecoach"", ""King Kong"" to name a few others. Lewis Milestones' ""Of Mice and Men"" and Lon Chaney's characterization of Lennie remains for me the definitive film translation of that literary work. Other great performances are executed by Bob Steele as Curley and especially Roman Bohnen as Candy. Both are Oscar-worthy efforts. Then again, this movie came out in 1939 so........

It's still a well-made movie, but I think I can sum it up with two questions for discussion: 1) Is it merciful and ""right"" to put down an old dog? 2) If you have a loved one who doesn't fit into society, or who very soon isn't going to be able to continue the life that he or she is accustomed to, is it merciful and ""right"" to put that person out of the misery that's sure to come?I consider the subject matter of this story to be EXTREMELY mature. No, there's no sex, language, or extreme violence, but the subject matter requires a mature intellect. ...or maybe it requires no intellect and absolute immaturity: A sixteen-year-old might easily be able to see the black and white and right and wrongs of the story; A sixty-six year old will only see the gray shades of the dilemmas.",Of Mice and Men
71,ashowen,Not Good,2,17 February 2006,"I enjoyed the book Of Mice and Men very much, however this film does not live up to any of the drama and emotion of the book. The screenplay is weak and the acting is terrible. The accent given to Lennie in the movie does not match at all with how it is written by Steinbeck. Gary Sinise's role as George was not believable, and Curley's Wife was some of the worst acting I have ever seen on film. The film was poorly thought out and poorly directed. Its lack of change in camera shots and the extremely slow and boring screenplay did not interest me at all. Lennie's voice was enough to make me want to shoot him in the first scene. It was so annoying, unlike the possibly lovable voice that Steinbeck gives to him in the book. Although it follows the book's plot closely, it is just a bad movie.",Of Mice and Men
72,square-eyed,One of the best films ever....EVER,10,18 August 2006,"My God I can't even explain how much I loved this film it was absolutely amazing. Gary Sinise was a fantastic actor and fair handed with his co star John Malkovich considering he was the director as well. I read the book to and this film is one of the best adaptations ever done, I can't explain how powerful this film was. It's incredibly sad but handled delicately not like Hollywood which usually swamps you in soppy pictures and ""emotional music"" not the story with this film. It was exceptional and I will never be able to forget this film I'm surprised it isn't more famous so if you read this review please please watch the film you will never ever regret it.",Of Mice and Men

My teacher was in a puddle.A fantastic script, very well done and compulsive make this a real must see. Lennie is portrayed awfully well, with Geroge giving a believable performance as his long suffering partner. WATCH THIS FILM. There is much more to it then can ever meet the eye, and this film is a true work of art...so is the book, which I suggest reading first.

In a previous version, Randy Quaid played a convincible George.  But in this newer production, rather than play George as more of a ""monster"" type role, Malkovich brings more sympathy to the George character. This makes for a much more moving film.

This is a great movie from beginning to powerful end and  I would recommend it to anyone who is willing to give drama movies a chance.Gary Sinise directed John Stienbecks novel perfectly.

John Malkovich, who is one of my favorite actors, never lets me down. People complain about his portrayal of Lennie, because he makes Lennie seem like a person with down syndrome? What do you expect him to do? Bang his hand against his chest while letting his tongue to hang out? To me, Malkovich WAS Lennie. Everything about this film was perfect.

Steinbeck was quite simply one of the finest writers of his time, rivalled only by Arthur Miller, and if you haven't read or seen OM&M then you may have to re-evaluate your life! I can think of few films - Requiem For A Dream, Blade Runner, and that's about it - that have survived the book-to-film evolution and come out looking so fantastic. From the acting of Malkovich and Sinise, to the directing and the beautiful sunny palettes, it all glues together to create one of the best films of all time. Rarely will you connect with characters so well.This film made me cry, and it is only the second to do that in my entire lifetime of watching films...you will find it nigh on impossible not to be moved by this film. See it ASAP.",Of Mice and Men
80,EECritic,A beautifully executed classic,10,16 August 2016,"I think this remake and execution of the novel 'Of Mice and Men' is rather solid and possibly up there with some of my favourite movies of all time.When it comes to how it's written, it's pretty much like the novel. However, there were some things that were changed/extended and whilst that may seem unfaithful to the general audience, I don't think it's really a problem because it does give a different perspective of the novel and perhaps gives us a new insight of the novel.The performances are also spot on. They seem genuinely realistic and do portray the characters very well IMO. The way they portray both George and Lennie does make us feel about them and their relationship was it does seem rather genuine.I also think the characters are executed very well as they act just like how they are portrayed in the novels. They all have different emotions which makes them identifiable.It also portrays the atmosphere during The Great Depression very well and we get a good idea of how the world is views in the eyes of 'the bindlestiffs'.Overall, it's a brilliant movie and I would recommend checking it out if you have read the novel.",Of Mice and Men
81,DRF,Of Mice and Men,9,14 August 1999,"Gary Sinese' 1992 version of ""Of Mice and Men"" written for the screen by Horton Foote is the closest to the original Steinbeck classic to date capturing the very essence of the Steinbeck characters in exactly the same way I remember them when I first read the book.",Of Mice and Men

From the moment I pressed play on the DVD player, I knew this was a quality piece of film.The film has a beautifully composed soundtrack and is visually very beautiful but what makes it so absolutely fab is, in my opinion, the chemistry between the two lead parts.Malkovich is one of my top 3 favourite actors and he gives this role 110% Some people on here have suggested that his portrayal is over the top but I found it nothing short of convincing.The story is a classic yarn which has everything... I laughed at the banter between George and Lennie; I cheered when Lennie 'taught' the vile Curly a lesson and even shed a tear at the ending.Best of all, this is one of those movies that, in many ways, begins after it ends.What I mean by that is - just after you've slipped the DVD back in it's case you will start thinking about it. There's a LOT of depth in that movie and a lot to think about! That, for me, is the hallmark of a classic.Watch this movie! Pure entertainment...",Of Mice and Men

The first was made in 1939 with Burgess Meredith and Lon Chaney Jr. The second was a made for television movie with Robert Blake and Randy Quaid. They were both great movies and this one is even better. Everything in this movie was done right. The viewer really feels he is on that depression era ranch near Soledad. This movie is a ""must-see"" for everyone who doesn't require constant car-chases and things getting blown up to enjoy a movie. It's too bad the studios pulled all promotion of this great movie and only a fortunate few of us got to see it on the big screen. I highly recommend this movie.",Of Mice and Men

Gary Sinise and John Malkovich were just perfect as George and Lennie and the supporting cast were as perfect, including the late Ray Walston as Candy, Sherilyn Fenn as Curley's Wife and Joe Morton as Crooks.

Ten years later I am still reading and re-reading his work. I had heard of the earlier version of this terrific story but was never inclined to literature of any substance. Then I read ""Of Mice and Men"" and it has been a life-changing experience. I never saw the Gary Sinise film at the cinemas over here in Oz, I don't actually recall it going to the cinemas. So when I stumbled across it in the video shop about 8 years ago I grabbed a copy. The film is as true to the book as I had hoped. The fact that it wasn't a box office smash, over here at least, is actually a blessing. Many great films are lying in video shops waiting to be discovered, like great music albums. They take a certain audience to appreciate them, this is not the domain of Scwarzenegger & Sandler. The book and movie are on the schools curriculum for English Literature which is ironic as when it was first released the book was banned here in Oz. Both book and movie ought to be consumed by as many people as possible, for in these difficult times with war on the horizon, the sentiments expressed in this tale will make people stop and think about life and its priorities. Sadly , as hinted at earlier, I think the Arnie & Adam mentality will prevail with the masses. A terrific movie adaptation of a modern classic.",Of Mice and Men

The acting was great, and it stuck true to the book. This movie brings up all emotions. I felt like it reached a cliffhanger at the end, which, in my opinion, made it even better. Of course, what else do you expect from Steinback? I loved the book, and I loved the movie.The book was short (100 pages), but the movie was nearly 2 hours. I'm normally a person for high-end films, but movies like these can be considered true classics.Again, I loved the movie, and I'd definitely see it again. My rating: 9/10.",Of Mice and Men
87,card53,One change (for the better) from the novel,10,14 May 2007,"It's true that the film follows the novel very faithfully, with the exception of a few details at the end. For me, the slightly revised ending is even more powerful than Steinbeck's original.Steinbeck wrote both novel and stage-play versions of OF MICE AND MEN at about the same time (ca. 1937), and it always seemed to me that the ending, in which the posse shows up after George shoots Lennie (""You hadda, George, you hadda""), was a device to get George off the stage at the end of the show. In Sinise's film, the posse never shows. Instead, the scene of George expressing his anguish over what he has just done dissolves into a shot of him riding the train. It's a more effective way of underscoring how alone in the world George is now.As a side note, it's a shame this film wasn't more popular when released in '92. Although the entire cast was superb, Ray Walston deserved an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. He might not have won against the likes of Hackman, Nicholson, and Pacino (three names you'd not expect to find in the supporting-actor category in the same year), but he deserved a nomination at the very least.",Of Mice and Men
88,tesscat,Beautifully done!,10,30 November 1999,"How often are we forced to endure the uninsightful changes that are made to American classics in the process of turning them into feature films?  The 1939 version of this movie is a prime example.  It, very simply, was not the story that Steinbeck wrote.  The changes that were made were too sweeping to be seen as anything other than some ego thinking that Steinbeck could be improved upon.Now, anyone who is truly familiar with Steinbeck knows that this is just not true.  Gary Sinise has proven this familiarity.  I have rarely had the pleasure of watching a movie that stayed so completely true to the original text.  Not only does this movie not add or subtract from the book, the characters themselves are almost exactly how I had pictured them when I read this story for the first time.If you are looking for overblown sex and violence, for spectacular special effects, or for unbelievable demonstrations raw physical strength, move on. This movie will not interest you in the slightest.  However, if you are looking for a story of true love and true courage, if you are looking for a movie whose beauty stems from a raw sense of humanity, then find yourself a quiet place, where you won't be interrupted and watch this.  You won't be let down.",Of Mice and Men
89,sparklesgirl,Make sure you tend the rabbits!,9,28 September 2006,"I recently watched this movie after reading the book. The book of course was very detailed, long, and had a lot of dialog. The movie however did a good job portraying the book, written by Steinbeck, as it included every main event in the book. Of Mice and Men is a wonderful story about the troubles of two men in the early American time era. John Malkovich plays the main character Lennie perfectly. With his presence in the movie, it makes the whole thing enjoyable. He brings a different character and personality to the screen. Lennie has certain troubles, but his only wish is to have a pet, a rabbit maybe and a nice house to live. Gary Sinise plays the 2nd main character: George. George protects Lennie. George and Lennie travel around together; thus begin the tales of their adventures. The movie itself also adds an extra scene that was not included the novel. Made in 1992, this movie previewed around the world, and is much loved. Of Mice and Men is used for school readings, colleges, and every day life. It is set in California around the Selenas and Sacramento. Steinbeck really produced a wonderful story about how two men bonded. I read the book then watched the movie. Often times you are disappointed by the movie, or notice a lot of things have been left out.Not for me though, this movie included every tiny detail. The characters were just like the characters in the novel I imagined. I'm sure if Steinbeck were alive right now, he'd be happy with this movie. Why would he be happy?Because it portrayed the love and friendship between two men. Just like he wanted to show.9/10 See it.",Of Mice and Men
90,frelly,"Beautiful, a true gem",9,26 November 2001,"I first saw this movie over the summer (2001), and I'm wondering where I was since '92 that I missed it until now.This is a gem of a movie: small in scope, with a rather quiet, intimate feel to it, but dazzling.  The acting is superb throughout with excellent performances, not just by Sinise and Malkovich, but also by John Terry, Ray Walston, Casey Siemaszko, Sherilyn Fenn, and Joe Morton.  The cinematography is gorgeous, with golden light everywhere, giving the setting an idyllic feel and giving the less-than-idyllic events an added jolt.

It's not that I don't understand the historical context - my parents are children of the Depression. I just didn't find George & Lenny believable. The tremendous performances of Malkovich & Sinese solved this for me. They were utterly believable and both did marvelous jobs interpreting their characters. Clearly, Gary Sinese did a great job with the direction. In addition to making the characters believable, he was able to play the movie out with a very deliberate pace. Like a car wreck that takes place in slow motion, the movie proceeds at a snail's pace through the few days from George & Lenny's arrival until the finale. The cinematography is visually enchanting, and reinforced the sense of the importance of things other than wealth - natural beauty, good friends, a hard day's work well done.

Like the part when Lennie was in Crooks' room, in the book, Candy was suppose to come in. And in the movie they added an extra scene, the one where Curley's Wife runs away from Lennie and George, crying. Other then that, the book is like the movie.Unlike the book, the movie makes the story come alive, especially the characters. This movie is tear jerking, especially the part where Curley and Lennie get into a fight, and the dog part. Gary Sinise and John Malkovich did a great performance.

96,jgfor3,"""Of Mice"" and Movie-making",7,29 May 2008,"If ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" were a book, with a page that described Shia LeBeouf's character swinging in trees with monkeys, it would be much more boring than actually seeing it. Even though that was a goofy scene, it added visuals that were needed to make the adventure more dramatic. Movies give audiences a perspective of the story that books only let them imagine. In the film ""Of Mice and Men,"" director Gary Sinese did a good job making viewers want to see, rather than just read about, what would happen next. The filmmakers changed sequences from Steinbeck's book to make the story more cinematic, but did not alter the themes of the original novel. This is apparent in the characters' transportation to the ranch, the scene in Crooks's barn, and George's attempt to fit the horse with a new shoe.Instead of using the long bus scene from the opening of the book, the filmmakers had the characters switch modes of transportation from train to bus to foot. The first thing the reader learns about how the characters arrived in town is George's line: ""We could just as well of rode clear to the ranch if that bastard bus driver knew what he was talking' 'bout"" (5.) This is different from the movie, in which the characters start on a train, and then transfer onto a bus, and then walk. As they travel, we see an old-fashioned town, a gas station, and the land surrounding the farm. The filmmakers made a bus ride that was only spoken about in the book into three actual, separate events. This is appropriate for a movie in order to keep the viewers' attention. Movies should show more visual detail than books, and the inclusion of the small town and the speeding train make the scene more cinematic. The filmmakers do not, however, change the original purpose of the scene, which is to show how difficult it is to travel with Lenny.Instead of staging the long conversation in Crooks's barn between Lenny, Crooks, Candy, and Curley's wife from the book, the filmmakers created a number of different scenes in different places. For example, the dialogue where Curley's wife asks, ""Say, what happened to Curley's han'?"" takes place later, while George, Lenny, and Slim are farming, in the movie (76.) The filmmakers separated the barn scene into four different parts because they didn't want too many questions to be asked and answered at once. This is more cinematic because without the consistent change of setting and actors, the audience will get bored. It's easier to read one long scene in a book because the author will not have to continually re-describe new settings. The director showed the same themes of loneliness through Curley's wife and friendship through Lenny's obedience of George by keeping Steinbeck's dialogue even though he split the scenes up.The scene is which George takes Slim's horse to be fitted for a new shoe, which was not in the book, helps to visually describe George's dislike for Curley's wife. In the book, the reader only learns about George's feelings toward Curley's wife through lines like Lenny's: ""George said I ain't to have nothing' to do with you, talk to you or nothing'"" (84.) We can infer that George doesn't like her because she always gets men in trouble. If Curley sees a man near her, he gets angrier than he already is. This is shown differently in the movie, in the barn scene where Curley's wife actually tries to talk to George and he turns his back on her. By adding this scene, the filmmakers made the movie more cinematic because they allowed the audience to actually see this conflict instead of just reading about and visualizing it. In the novel, women bring bad news when they get mixed up with men. This theme has not changed in the movie even though the director has invented a new scene.By keeping the original themes of ""Of Mice and Men"" and making the sequences more cinematic for the viewers, the filmmakers created a great movie. The different methods of transportation, the added scenes in the barn sequence, and the meeting between George and Curley's wife make the movie more entertaining rather that a montage of long, boring moments. Making a good movie out of a book is not easy, and adding extra scenes without destroying the main theme is even tougher. In this movie, the filmmakers did a great job of preserving Steinbeck's ideas even though they changed the details.",Of Mice and Men

It's funny how someone as intellectual and bright as Malkovich can pull his role off so well. Gary Sinese was great too, effectively portraying George.But if you really get into the book, the movie doesn't follow it too faithfully. Curely's wife is portrayed to be flirty, and a ""tart,"" when in the book, she was just as lonely as everyone else on the ranch. She wasn't looking for sex, she was looking for companionship. The screenwriter didn't interpret the book quite as well as I had hoped.Now I'm just nitpicking, but when when Lennie pulls the stunt by faking the puppy, it's just not like him. Lennie is not clever at all, and wouldn't think to do that.But all in all, great movie, definitely great for comparing to the book in a lit. class or anywhere.8/10",Of Mice and Men

But as director and actor, he pulled off a masterpiece with this movie.I have only one criticism: as good an actor as John Malkovich is, he's not Lenny Small. My choice for the role, and there's only one, would have been Bill Fagerbakke (Tom Cullen, in Stephen King's ""The Stand"" [and most recently the voice of Patrick, in Spongebob Squarepants]).But that's minor. Gary Sinise did Steinbeck justice. He had the real handle on the story, took George and made him visible.It's one of the few books-turned-into-movies that stands as an equal to the original. View it.

I think I like it most of all because the relationship between George and Lenny is like the relationship I have with my brother. I am big and strong just like Lenny, and my brother is much smaller than me and quite clever and quick minded and we look out for each other. there are several bits of the film that I like particularly when Lenny breaks Curley's hand which is just what Curley deserved. There are also several parts that even I think are sad like when they shoot the dog and the ending is so sad. this is definitely one of the best films I have ever seen.",Of Mice and Men
102,mrblickles,Great Film,9,10 October 2016,"Adapting a classic novel into a film is no easy feat and Of Mice and Men is no exception. The reason it is so difficult to adapt a novel into a film is that with a book, you get to interpret it in the way that best serves your interests but with a film you only get to see a single interpretation. However in my opinion the 1992 film adaptation is a faithful and, more importantly, enjoyable adaptation of the source material. The cast is what can make or break a film adaptation. In my opinion, the reason this adaptation works so much better than the 1939 version is that the 1992 version has a very strong and talented cast. Ray Walston does an exceptional job as Candy. In the beginning of the movie, I was not overly impressed but my mind was changed during the scene in which his dog is shot. His raw emotion made me have a sense of pity and sorrow for his character. After that point every scene he was in, I was continuously impressed with his performance.I thought Gary Sinise did an alright job of playing George. George did not come across the same way in this movie as he did in the book. While I did still enjoy his performance, I just did not think he truly captured the essence of his character. I do have to give him credit for two scenes I thought were done exceptionally well. The scene in the beginning where they camp out by the river did an excellent job of showing the relationship these two men had and I believe a large part of that is due to Sinise's performance. The other scene I was impressed with was the final scene where George kills Lennie. The scene itself was done perfectly (more on that later) and a large part of that is due to the portrayal of George.But I can say with absolute certainty that my favorite portrayal was John Malkovich as Lennie. Malkovich portrays the character almost flawlessly. He is able to capture Lennie's innocence but also convey his brute strength. Malkovich also does an excellent job of portraying a character with special needs. He shows the character has difficulty learning and adapting but is in no way dumb and he is never over the top about it which can be difficult when portraying a character with special needs.What I appreciated about this movie was that it kept the memorable and enjoyable parts of the book but was not afraid to stray away from the source material at points. Certain scenes of the movie seemed to be almost lifted straight from the book. The scene in which candies dog is killed was one of the scenes I thought seemed like it had been pulled directly from the book. The same emotions I felt while reading the book were mimicked almost exactly in the movie. But what made this movie so enjoyable to me was that it was not afraid to go in its own direction from time to time. I liked how the opening was changed to show what had happened before they got to the ranch. It gave a little more context it what is later revealed to be Lennie's doing. Lennie's death scene was done so brilliantly that I almost think it was better than it was in the book. Although it was very similar to the book, it made some changes that I believe improved it. George shooting Lennie was a lot more unexpected than it was in the book. Instead of building it up like the book, the movie chose to make it a bit more sudden and surprising which gave it a far stronger affect.The final scene of this film serves sort of as a metaphor to the movie as a whole. It was emotional, expertly done, and similar to the book but takes liberties when need be. Overall, this was an excellent movie. 9/10 stars",Of Mice and Men
103,mrneagoe,They are not like the others....,10,24 June 2005,"The movie ""Of Mice and Man"" is one of the most impressing movies i have ever seen lately.I think that the central idea is loneliness.It is also about attachment ,friendship and loyalty(loyalty to a friend). It is very interesting in this movie that all the characters are feeling lonely and they are all trying to find someone to lean on them. It is very interesting how the beginning of the movie repeat it self at the end.The scene with the dog is perfect replayed at the end when George kills his friend.It is a sign of loyalty to him not to let the others to shut him.It is like, till the end, he protects him and take care of him.Also he does that letting him listen for the last time their dream with the house. And in the end you will see that George wos right:they are not like the others...... .",Of Mice and Men
104,Drinkard,Tear-jerking story of innocence and its price...,10,3 February 1999,"Malkovich and Sinise beautifully portray the characters George and Lennie from Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men. Sinise has certainly proven that he has some serious directing potential. The viewer is made to feel love and pity for the innocent, retarded Lennie Small (Malkovich), and hearts are broken during the dramatic climax. Malkovich and Sinise are an unbeatable duo, and I pray to see them co-star again soon. Two thumbs up!",Of Mice and Men

106,leroy-17,Entertainment of astonishing quality,9,6 November 1999,An incredible movie -- in the top three greatest movies of all time.  John Malkovich was breathtaking in this performance.

107,MHeying777,A Beautifully Rendered Mutilation of Curley's Wife,8,27 December 2011,"Warning, I'm a Steinbeck purist.I loved this film. I even arm-twisted my two pre-teen/teenaged daughters to go with me. For the closing scene I left my chair, went to the back and cried, even though I knew what was coming.The acting, the sets/props, the cinematography were all outstanding, sometimes brilliant. The only problem was the script--Curley's wife was softened, made into a victim instead of Steinbeck's brilliantly conceived and rendered cruel, cynical female villain. All that work, the craft, sweat and tears it took for him to create her, mutilated for the sake of profit.But this is nothing new. Every stage and screen interpretation of OMM has done the same thing. Why? Money, of course. Women make up the majority of moviegoers (and an even larger majority of movie-going decision-making). What producer has the courage to offend a predominately female audience?Well, American BEAUTY didn't do so badly.It is well known that Elaine Steinbeck lobbied John to allow the Curley's wife character to be softened. She was trained in theater. She wanted the stage and film versions to be a ""success.""Well, just once I'd like to see Curley's wife depicted just as John created her. Especially the scene where she barges in to Crooks' room and calls him ""N****"" repeatedly and threatens him with lynching.It's cultural self-deception to pretend that women can't be just as nasty as men. Are all you producers cowards or what?(Kudos to Ken Wales and Jane Seymour for going the distance with EAST OF EDEN!)",Of Mice and Men
108,crazy_flip94,Very Enjoyable,8,31 October 2006,"The movie ""Of Mice and Men"" was really good. The story was very dramatic and interesting. It was similar to the book and a little bit better. I've got a better idea of what the setting was like and I understand it more after watching the movie. There were some parts of the movie where it was very dramatic and there were some parts of the movie where it was very boring. But overall the parts were very interesting and thrilling. In the movie, almost every part was covered from the book. The actors resembled very much like the characters in the book and the music was good in the specific parts. The actors acted like they were the actual characters and they were very dramatic. Especially George and Lennie. The actor of Lennie acted so much like the actual Lennie, the same thing with George.

Although the movies left out some of the parts from the book, it was still a brilliant experience to watch. I really liked watching the movie because the story really captured my attention. I think that the actors chosen to play the main characters were excellent. When i read this book at school, i though it was very interesting, and watching the movie only encouraged me to enjoy it more. My class liked the movie and book so much, that our teacher arranged us to go see the theatre play for ""Of Mice And Men"". After we watched the play, we were mezmerized by the excellent performance.

110,D-butson,A powerfully retold story with excellent acting and a perfectly edited plot,8,5 November 2006,"'Of Mice and Men' Play Review I thought the movie Of Mice and Men was well converted onto film and had outstanding acting. I find most books that are turned into movies are not as effective in the form of film because they were not written as such. 'Of Mice and Men' was an outstanding movie. I believe that the reason for it's success in such a variety of medias is not because of the content of the original story but rather the director and writers modification of the content. I thought that certain deletions and additions are what really helped the book translate so simply into a movie. In particular, the addition of the series of scenes in the beginning of the movie helped give the characters much more definition before the plot line of the book had actually begun. This was a necessary and very well calculated change because unlike the book where Steinbeck was able to show the characters personalities through narration, the movie had no such element that could describe outside of the literal visual events and dialogue. To make up for this lack of dimensions the movie added the events preceding the book more to allow you to understand the characters then anything else. The acting in this movie was another element that really allowed it to be carried out so well. The actors showed the emotions almost exactly as they were written, and so it was easy to understand what was going on. John Malkovich played Lennie with such clarity that it was as easy to sympathize with his childish naiveté and unfortunate mistakes. Overall I thought this movie was an excellent adaptation of the book and I would rate it 4 out of 5 stars.-Dylan",Of Mice and Men
111,lanny_fai,Wonderful. Simply wonderful.,9,6 November 2006,"At first glance, you might think, 'oh no, another ranch story about guys trying to fulfill their dreams, so typical.' And you know what, you're absolutely right. It's the simplicity of this story that makes everything so heart-warming. Steinbeck did a superb job portraying one of the human race's biggest weaknesses, how we all wish to love and be loved, and how holding onto those we cherish is just so darn hard. Even in the film it was beautifully done, I especially love the way John Malkovich did the voice of Lennie, childish and half-witted. Kudos to Gary Sinise (who also happens to play George Milton) for successfully directing such a heart-rending classic.",Of Mice and Men
112,dslojkowski,One of my favorite books and a beautiful adaptation,10,10 July 2010,"I didn't even know Gary Sinise and John Malkovich had done this. I just stumbled across it in Netflix while looking for the Robert Blake version I'd seen in high school. I love John M, but was not sure how he'd be as Lenny and let me just say... I bawled as if I was living the story myself. He was just the perfect Lenny, better than my own imagination had ever made him. Gary Sinise just did such a tribute to Steinbeck in this movie and if I could hug him, I would. I wanted to put my arms around almost every character in this story and help them with their pain. Gary's direction really brought out the characters and I felt each and every one of them - except Curley, who... well... you're supposed to hate. I'm just very happy I watched this alone, because I was able to just let my grief for everyone flow like Steinbeck wanted.",Of Mice and Men
113,Phoenix-Rain,Reviewed for class,10,30 January 2002,"I watched this movie in English class, and was blown away. I despised the novel, but the movie was great! Following is my review:Much can be said about a film that exceeds the novel it is based upon. Especially when the novel is a classic and integral part of American literature. Such is the case of Gary Sinise's film rendition of John Steinbeck's timeless story Of Mice And Men. From the talented acting to the beautiful imagery kept from the novel, this motion picture should be treated with a deep respect. Not only has the director kept the endearing straightforwardness of the original, he has grown and stretched the characters without detracting from them, a difficult feat by any standards. Unlike the book, the film becomes alive, drawing you deeper and deeper into the dramatic web of Lennie and George, two traveling farm workers trying to make a living during the Great Depression and earn a little on the side to buy their own place. Just a little place, with rabbits and chickens, a place to call their own. Unlike many people today, it's what they really wanted, not a big thing. A place where they could go and hang their hats. The two find a job bucking barley, but trouble just won't let them be. The boss's son has a problem with Lennie, a childlike giant of a man that doesn't understand why the man is trying to fight him. George is driven to protect his simpleminded friend to the end, something he does.The level of acting has not been seen in Hollywood since the days of Audrey Hepbourne and James Stewart. John Malkovich is brilliant as the lovable Lennie, perfectly capturing his true innocence. `George, tell me about them rabbits,' he joyfully exclaims, unaware how odd he seems to an outsider. Who can ever feel anything but passion for a man whose life centers on being able to care for the rabbits? George is also radiantly portrayed by Gary Sinise, keeping the character's gruff manner without making him seem unaffectionate in the least. The supporting cast is also wonderfully depicted, a rarity in today's world. Ray Waltson(Candy), Casey Siemaszko (Curley), Sherilyn Fenn (Curley's wife) and the others make the viewing experience much more pleasurable, bringing depth to the characters, something that was sadly lacking in the novel. The cinematography is beautiful, a stark contrast to the shocking events that occur. The golden light feeling is soothing, adding a jolt when violence rears its ugly head. Beautiful scenery and magnificent directing weaves symbolisms into the story, earning this movie the right to be labeled a film. Truly portraying the real grit of the story, something that the author was incapable of, this version of Of Mice And Men is Oscar worthy, a true gem of a film. When the audience is finished, they have a sense of completion. Loyalty, friendship and the American dream can be understood with simple clarity, and celebrated.",Of Mice and Men
114,booboo_4,Of Mice and Men (1992),10,29 February 2012,"I too was dubious of the casting of John Malkovich as Lenny. I had never seen him portray such a character before, and was unsure he could pull it off like Dustin Hoffman did in Rainman. I was also unsure that he could measure up physically as Lenny's size and strength are integral to the plot. I am happy to say that I was very pleasantly surprised. Malkovich was superb in the role, and the chemistry between him and Sinise was sublime. I didn't think anyone could top Burgess Meredith and Lon Chaney Jr., but this film did. I was thrilled to see the way Sinise's direction of the film remained as true to the classic work of Steinbeck. Everyone played their part to the best of their ability, and it shows. Magnificent.",Of Mice and Men

Not only is Steinbeck a genious, but so is Gary Senise for having an idea to create a novel into a motion picture. out of a 10, i give Gary Senise a 10, John Malkovich a 10, and this movie i give a 10. i love this movie! it is very touching.",Of Mice and Men
116,ottoprado,1301 Assignment,10,5 October 2010,"The movie Of Mice and Men is a motion picture adaptation of John Steinbecks novel directed by Gary Sinise who also plays as George Milton. Sinise and Steinbeck were close friends and when Steinbeck died Sinise decided to create the motion adaptation into something that he knew from his heart that Steinbeck would have enjoyed to watch over and over again. John Malkovich plays the character Lennie Small, with music by Mark Isham, and Kenneth MacMillan as the Director of Photography. This movie is set in the depression era and is no doubt a drama. The riveting story is a tale of two men whom travel together across the land to make money to fulfill their dreams. George is a small quick witted man, while Lennie is a slow giant. They often have to find work elsewhere because Lennie accidentally falls into trouble. Lennie and George came together because George knew Lennies aunt Clair whom use to give Lennie rabbit and mice to pet because he loved to pet soft things. Lennie would often kill the animals by petting them too hard, so aunt Clair stopped giving them. Clair died and asked George to take care of Lennie, so George made the promise. Since then they had been traveling together with the thought of one day owning a land of their own. George would often tell this detailed story of owning the fat of the land to Lennie, and promised him that one day he would get to tend the rabbits.When watching this movie compared to the book one thing to think about is how convincing and well played everything is. Most can say that it depends on the actors skills to persuade the audience, but without the perfect camera location, the movie could look like another youtube sensation. Kenneth MacMillan does an excellent job at creating mood solely with the camera, for example when Carlson was persuading Candy to let him shoot his old dog. Carlson walked over to his bunk to retrieve his gun, but Slim was having a conversation with Whitt about somebody in the newspaper. However Slim and Whitt were blurred out, showing Carlson in the back ground showing that although other things are happening within the room. Candy is only focused on one thing. Another thing to consider is the music placement within the film. Mark Isham did the music track to this film and definitely made the movie a seat gripping experience when something were to occur. Music can change the mood and emotion of just about anything. Just in the beginning when it showed the woman in the red dress running for her life the music was very appealing to the ear letting us know that nothing completely fatal had happened, but something unfortunate and accidental may have occurred. The music throughout the movie is very western and well placed.Overall this film was a hoot and a holler. John Malkovich played a stunning roll as Lennie, and Gary Sinise could not have done a better job at re-creating such a great book into a movie. Watch this with an open mind and you will be placed into their shoes, as well as their hearts.",Of Mice and Men

It has all the ingredients required to be among the top dramas ever! Malkovich, who for some peculiar reason was neglected by the academy, makes the most amazing personification of Lennie ever seen on or off stage.

118,stinkbomb-859-966098,"George and Lennie wander the countryside, dreaming of a better life for themselves.",9,5 October 2010,"Of Mice and Men is a movie adapted from the novel, ""Of Mice and Men"" by John Steinbeck. Gary Sinise, who also played George, directed the 1992 novel-based film. John Malkovich played the part of Lennie. Other supporting actors include Casey Siemaszko as Curley, and Sherilyn Fenn as Curley's wife. The movie is set during the Depression Era, at a time when the government paid ranchers to take on extra workers. This dramatic film is the story of their efforts to fulfill their dream of owning a farm of their own.George and Lennie are men traveling by railway to their new job as ranch hands. Because Lennie does not know his own strength, he accidentally kills his pet mouse. George promises to get Lennie a dog if Lennie would stop taking mice to be his pets. True to his word, George finds Lennie a pup of his own, and Lennie enjoyed playing and petting his pup anytime he could. Shortly after arriving, Lennie and George get acquainted with Curley, the boss' son. Lennie soon becomes Curley's target of aggression, because Lennie, being mentally handicapped, was an easy target for him. Lennie also became the target of Curley's wife's attention too, because she saw him as a willing ear to vent her frustrations. She became a problem to Lennie because Curley, who already wanted to hurt Lennie, found out about their conversations. Curley was infuriated, and started a fight with Lennie. It was only when George allowed him did Lennie fight back. After the fight George helps Lennie clean his wounds and help him recover emotionally. I enjoyed the scene of Lennie's first day working, because Lennie's job was to help load sacks of grain into a cart. To lift one sack of grain, two men were required, or Lennie. Lennie was so big and strong that he could lift a whole sack of grain by himself, thereby doubling the work that could be done. Another of my favorite scenes was the one with Lennie lying in the barn, playing with his pup. Finally, I think one of the most sad moments in the movie is when Lennie is in the barn, mourning the death of his pup. His pup died because he doesn't know his own strength, One aspect of the film that I enjoyed is the acting. Gary Sinise and John Malkovich play their parts perfectly, and the rest of the cast make the story come to life. I think that the delivery of the lines played a big part in making the movie realistic. George's lines are strong, and fast, and show how much he cares for Lennie. Lennie's lines are delivered more slowly, and are usually fragmented into single thoughts or ideas. Lennie's facial expressions also set the mood for different scenes during the movie. As an example, when Curley started punching Lennie, Lennie was not angry at first, but was only confused. Only when George told Lennie to fight back, did Lennie save himself.Another aspect I liked was the directing. Gary Sinise delivered the movie as close to the book as possible, and brought it to life visually. Sinise had a good understanding of the novel, its settings, and the events surrounding the story line. Sinise wanted his audience to believe that the story was real, by using scenes that appeal to the viewer's senses. For an example, the ranch owner did not have a luxurious house, but more of a cozy country home. The director These make the scenes more pleasant to look at and add minute details for the effect he desired.A wonderful movie, Of Mice and Men, is timeless. This movie is better watched all at once, rather than coming in late during the movie, or stopping halfway through.",Of Mice and Men
119,jhigh12,Film Review,8,5 October 2010,"The film Of Mice and Men is based on John Steinbeck's novella Of Mice and Men. He wrote the book Of Mice and Men from his own experience as a bindle-stiff in the 1920's. He worked as a farm hand, just like the two lead characters George Milton played by Gary Sinise and Lennie Small played by John Malkovich, in the movie. The movie Of Mice and Men is categorized a ""drama"" film, and takes place in California during the ""Great Depression."" George and Lennie are two hired work hands who though very poor and not very fortunate are lucky because they had each other. During this time period and setting loneliness and alienation was common for all men like George and Lennie. Most men traveled alone to find work. George feels responsible for Lennie because George knew Lennie's aunt who took care of him until she died. Lennie had no one to take care of him so George took him under his wing. Throughout the film you learn about Steinbeck's motives and underlying truths weaved into the dialog of George and Lennie.Of Mice and Men begins with a woman screaming, crying and running in a prairie- like field. With her are men on horses with guns and dogs that seem to be chasing or tracking down something. George and Lennie are running from these men because Lennie gave a woman the impression he was raping her by grabbing a hold of her dress. Lennie is mentally disabled and does not know how to control himself. He loves touching soft things and when he saw the woman's dress he couldn't help but grab it. They escape to this pond where George explains to Lennie if he ever gets in trouble to come back to the pond and hide in the bushes. At the new ranch that George and Lennie go to work at, Lennie finds something else soft to touch and feel. The head ranch hand has a dog that has recently given birth to puppies and Lennie falls in love with petting and feeling the runt of the bunch. There is a story that Lennie loves to hear from George and frequently asks him to retell it. George tells him about their dream. This dream is told throughout the movie. Steinbeck is trying to portray this dream of man constantly falling short of their hopes and dreams. He portrays not what we read about or what makes us happy but the truth. The truth in this time period was that man was constantly fighting just to survive, it was a daily struggle. There was this constant desire for companionship and ownership of land or anything to call their own. In the film the boss that George and Lennie work for has a son named Curly who has a wife that Steinbeck chooses never to name. She had no more worth than just property to Curly. He constantly acts and talks to her like he owns her and tries to keep her in the house at all times.In Steinbeck's film we can understand the entire movie, plot and Steinbeck's motives by just one dialog by George and Lennie when George is retelling Lennie their dream. George says to Lennie, ""Guys like us that work on ranches are the loneliest guys in the world. They ain't got no family and the got no place. They got nothing to look ahead to."" Lennie interrupts him in mid sentence saying, ""But not us George! Tell about us!"" George continues with a grin, ""Well we ain't like that. We got a future. We got someone to talk to that gives a damn about us. If them other guys gets in jail they can rot for all anybody cares."" Lennie interrupts again, ""But not us George, because I, see, I got you to look after me, but you got me to look after you."" This simple dialog can explain everything about the outlook of man at this period in time. Man had nothing to look forward to but to survive and nothing to call their own. Steinbeck illustrates this sad but true picture through his dialog throughout the whole story of Of Mice and Men. In the end I believe Steinbeck was trying to portray the life of the men that no one notices or looked over. The truths behind what others would leave out and I would recommend this film strongly to anyone not just looking for a good movie but for those in search of something pure, true, real and historic.",Of Mice and Men
120,papascub,Yesterday and Today,9,4 October 2010,"Not only is this a great movie for a literature class its also a great movie for history.This movie gives great examples of two completely unrelated characters on how they travel together, George taking the responsibility of Lenny. Without any thoughts of self-righteousness or shred of greed from taking advantage of Lenny's size, strength and lack of social skills.Scene starts out with the two of them running from the Law, and end up going cross country to Salt Lake City Utah. The year was back in the mid to late 30's back when the Great Depression was still felt and jobs were limited.The biggest thrill I get from movies like this is its like going back in time to when things such as autism and other mental conditions were still misunderstood. In the movie you get a real since on how things were back then. From the Greyhound bus strip to working in the wheat fields with the wheat thresher. A time where Television hasn't even reached parts of the country such as this.As far as the two characters Lenny played by John Malkovich and George played by Gary Sinise both bring a certain freshness to the story. This movie has been made a number of times and its a relief to see how this story plays out through new actors. John brings an excellent performance in the kind, strong man known as Lenny. A man that understands very little in the world around him, and still have the kindness and gentle heart that is rare in such a man.George Melton played by Gary Sinis balanced out the duel in a most interesting way. Though Lenny was quiet and didn't speak much, he always had George there to guide him in the right direction. George on the other hand wasn't as big or as strong as Lenny but a made up for it in by helping Lenny in areas that wasn't as easy. The bond the two had remind me of two brothers, two men that understood each other. Both having a lack of skills but together working as a team. The movie over all was pretty well made, the picture was fantastic. Music was well written, and the scenes were well blended. I've watched the movie at least three times since it came out and every time I watch it there are some scenes that i still cant watch. It's a great story for people of all ages, and its a movie people can take a lesson from and apply that lesson into todays world.",Of Mice and Men
121,itzjeremy2005,Of Mice and Men movie review,8,4 October 2010,"Of Mice and Men John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men is a tragedy staring John Malkovich and Gary Senise. It's an old-fashioned film set during the great depression time period in California.The film begins with two guys, George and Lennie, who are hiding from a group of dogs and men on horses. They are able to escape them by hiding in a ditch with water and tall grass all around them. George and Lennie are loners who walk across the country to a farm where they had jobs waiting for them. George and Linnie have a dream to buy a place of there own and talk about this dream throughout the film. George is a shy guy who seems to be a average guy with a dream. Linnie is a little bit slow, huge, and possesses incredible strength. George is very protective over Linnie. Immediately upon arrival at the Tyler Ranch the bosses son Curley begins to pick on Linnie. Curley was a little guy who is even described in the film has a little guy who likes to pick on big guys. Curley abuses his position as the bosses son and picks on and bullies all the guys who work at the ranch. Curley has a wife who is also under his abuse. Curley's wife is lonely and a flirtatious pretty lady. With all of this in place the movie quickly unravels into a tragedy.Candy was a worker at the farm, and displayed great acting in a scene about his dog. In this scene some of the other workers complained that Candy's dog was old and was really stinky. They suggested that he put the dog down. Candy didn't have what it took too take out his own dog and let another man kill his dog. They didn't show this in the film but by Candy's acting it felt as if you were there watching his dog being shot.Director Gary Sinise does a excellent job keeping everything he has going on under control. He manages to craft together a emotional story with great beginning, middle, and tragic end. The characters are very strong and play there parts brilliantly. Sinise did a excellent job at showing what a difficult character George was and showing the emotion through the characters. Sinise also made the movie very clear, everything went together nicely and made since.Of Mice and Men is a excellent film that portrays excellently the flaws in people. Its has great acting and directing that make the story really realistic, one I can relate to. The quality of the film is outstanding, it really makes you feel as if you are there. I would recommend that you watch it twice so you can see the film to its full potential, there is just so much meaning to what is going on the film.",Of Mice and Men
122,davisk31,movie review,8,4 October 2010,"Of mice and men is based on the novel written by John Steinbeck. The time this story took place was around the 1920's. In this film there are two main stars Gary Sinise who plays George and John Malkovich who plays Lennie's character. Lennie is a little bit slow and needs George to guide him and help him along the way. George is very mature and takes care of not only himself but Lennie too. At times he gets frustrated and upset, but at the end of the day he loves Lennie. Even though at times in this film there would be a joke or a laugh this was not a comedy it was a drama and very serious throughout. This movie begins with two men running away from a large group of men and dogs. It does not show why they are running away but you notice they are very scared and are sprinting for what could be there lives. In the movie they hide in very thick grass to escape these men and finally travel along the road. While they travel George knows exactly where they are going to go. They have to find a new place to work so they can obtain money. George often tells Lennie about a house and land with bunnies, this is what their goal is after they raise enough money. They dream of having their own place to live and their own land to tend. When they arrive at the ranch they are going to work at, they see where they will be staying. Lennie doesn't like this place at all, but he realizes that if they work hard enough and stay out of trouble he will be able to take care of the rabbits on their own ranch. During their stay at the ranch the head ranchers son Curly picks on Lennie because of his disability. He tries to get into fights with him. One night Curly started to punch Lennie repeatedly in the face until finally George gave Lennie the okay to fight back. Once he fought back he completely crushed Curly's hand with only one arm. Even though Lennie is slow he is extremely strong and can crush anything or anyone with only one hand. Curly found this out the hard way. Although Lennie crushed Curly's hand he did not want to, he doesn't like violence and wouldn't choose to fight if he didn't have to. One night George goes out to the town with some of the guys and leaves Lennie at the ranch by himself. While Lennie wanders around, he comes to a single room with a light on. He goes in and is immediately met by a man yelling at him. This man was the only black man on the ranch and was secluded from the rest of the workers because of his skin color. However Lennie didn't understand any of this and just wanted someone to talk to. At the first sight of Lennie the man was angry and thought it made no sense coming in there since nobody had before. After the beginning outburst they sat down and talked or a while until George came back and took Lennie back to their room. While the men work on the ranch most of the other look at Lennie in a strange way because he is different than most people. However one of the head ranchers Slim is very pleased to have him a part of his group considering his strength. While other men go in two's to carry bags of different things Lennie can do it all by himself and make it a much faster system. This makes the rancher very pleased and shows Lennie in a good light. Music in a film is a huge role and can make or break a movie in some cases. The reason it is such a huge deal is because a lot of times music can determine the mood of a person or of an entire scene for that matter. When there is something bad happening or sad the music usually follows that emotion. In times of happiness there is an upbeat and uplifting song to go along with that certain scene. In this movie there were many occasions where music was an important part of the scene such as the opening scene. In the first scene you see two men running for what would seem like their lives. In the back round the music is fast and somewhat angry and this goes along with the scene perfectly. Another example where music is a large part in the movie is the scene where George becomes very angry and upset with Lennie. They are by the river during this scene and there was a sad melody playing in the background that suits this scene just right. Another aspect of film is the acting. It is very important, this is how the actors present themselves and make sure they play the role correctly. In the film Of Mice and Men, John Malkovich plays Lennie. John Malkovich plays a person with a disability. However in real life he does not have that disability, therefore in this movie he did a wonderful job showing the audience the real character and how the director wanted him to be portrayed. Gary Sinise who is also the director of the film plays George. George is very stern and is known for being mature and in charge. Gary Sinise does a very great job of showing the audience how George should be looked at. Overall I think this was a tremendous film, the director and actors did a wonderful job showing the viewers how the story was suppose to be portrayed. If you are looking for a funny happy movie this is definitely not the movie for you. Even though I believe this is a great movie it is also very sad and you may find yourself crying at certain points during the movie.",Of Mice and Men
123,sina-sabet19,English 1301,10,5 October 2010,"""Of Mice and Men"" is a movie directed by Gary Sinise based on the novel written by John Steinbeck. It stars John Malkovich, ""Lennie"", and Gary Sinise, ""George"". Alexis Arquette and Sherilyn Fenn are the female actors in this movie. It's a very good and interesting movie and serves its purpose pretty well.It is very symbolic that the film begins and ends at the pond. It's trying to say that life comes in full circle. The characters are so powerless to accomplish their dream. They are limited to their circumstances and the social environment surrounding them. Their dreams never come true. Every time, they try something they end up back at the same point. It allows the audience to reflect on how life is full of difficulties, and unfortunately, many of them are caused by injustice. But we need to work hard and try to take the right steps. John Malkovich does a great job being Lennie. He portrays Lennie's character so well. Lennie is so naive despite all his extraordinary physical strength. He is as pure and kind hearted as a child. There is only one thing that he really understands; and that is love. You can clearly feel the impact of love on him. He appreciates George's love and care for him, so he is willing to do anything for him. Lennie is as a clear hollow reed –empty of all the veils we, human, create for ourselves- which love can flow through him to anything. John is fully able to help the audience really feel this. He's able to help us relate to Lennie's character. Gary Sinise is also able to portray George's character very well, and make the audience feel like he/she is involved in the story. He is very good at having appropriate facial expressions and body language in each scene. He makes you believe you're in there. In the story, George shoots his beloved companion, Lennie, to spare him a cruel death. He knows that Lennie will be killed by the angry mob, for (accidentally) murdering Curley's wife. On the other hand, Candy is not able to shoot his old dog. Perhaps, if Candy was in the same situation, he would shoot his dog to spare him a cruel death. These parts of the stories are just different expressions of genuine love for another creature. Some could be a good role-model and some a bad one, depending on the conceptual beliefs of an audience.All characters of the movie are lonely in a way or another. George and Lennie, have no home, neither family. Still, loneliness could be seen different for each. George doesn't even have someone to understand him, consult with, and share his thoughts with. On the other hand, George knows Lennie pretty well and tried to understand his circumstances. Curley is isolated because he's trying to be that leader / ""Son of the Boss"" which he is so disable to accomplish. He's on the wrong path. He never learned that he can do that by building strong relationships and being a good example. His wife has no one to interact with. There are no females on the ranch, and all the men try to ignore her because they're afraid of Curley.At the end of the story, Curley is trying to find Lennie and kill him. His real motivation for wanting to kill Lennie is not so much to take revenge for his wife's murder. Curley finds this, a good opportunity to take revenge for what Lennie did to his hand, to stop him from beating him up. He also thinks that this is a good chance for him to show off his power and find his place as the number one guy.",Of Mice and Men

Which really helped the viewer understand the emotional underlying factors to the plot.Setting The main setting is out in the country at ""Tyler Ranch"". I interpreted this as a symbol for loneliness. The Country is very isolated, being out in the middle of nowhere and somewhere. Overall I liked the movie.

The Music in this movie was rarely played but when it was it matched the scenario perfectly. In the beginning when they are running violins and trumpets at a very fast pace to make he viewer feel the suspense of the two friends running with their hearts beating fast. Also when they are at work and every things fine. The music is a mixture of bluegrass and classical.The acting in the movies was great. Gary Sinise and John Malkvich make a great team. Amanda Mackey Johnson did a great job pairing these two actors. Also along with slick and Candy the actor really brought out the true characters of the book itself.Overall this movie was great.

126,paul-browning-862-121354,Of mice and Men,7,5 October 2010,"""Of Mice and Men"", directed by Gary Sinise in 1992, is the third film adaptation of John Steinbeck's 1937 novella of the same name. Gary Sinise plays George Milton, a struggling farm worker with dreams of one day having his own farmland to work, while protecting his dim-witted and strong-backed friend Lennie Smalls played by John Malkovich. Lennie is a sweet but slow man, who due to his learning difficulties and the stigma attached to that at the time, often ends up getting in trouble and the pair lose their jobs, and are forced to hit the road once again in search for new work. The Film begins with the George and Lennie on a train escaping their previous job, where they were chased away by men and dogs, running because Lennie, in his innocent way, created a problem that was misunderstood. Its obvious that George cares deeply for Lennie, not only through the way he takes care of Lennie, but also how he tells to Lennie of how when they raise enough money to buy a plot of land they can tend, and Lennie will raise the rabbits, because of his fondness for soft and cute things. As they make their way to their new place of work having been lied to by a bus driver not wanting to take them all the way to the new ranch kicks them off the bus and they have to make their way on foot. Stopping in a creek bed to rest, George tells Lennie about the farm they will have together again, and tells Lennie should anything bad happen to meet him there again. After they meet the farmer they meet his son Curly, who is an angry young man, and fearsome fist fighter to boot. Curly's wife is bored and left alone by Curly on the farm and always trying to talk to all the farm hands to spark Curly's anger. The story continues and them men work in the field, none quite as efficiently as Lennie, who is strong enough to double the speed of all the other hands. This leads to some griping to those who cannot keep up with his speed. Lennie is finally rewarded with a puppy of his own to care, although it is not old enough to leave its mother, he sometimes sneaks it away to pet, until George catches him at it. The climax starts to rise as George and Lennie bring the old man Candy, with one hand, who will help pay for the farm, because once Candy becomes to old to be any help, the ranchers will fire him, and he will not be able to cope on his own even though he has $350 saved up. Gary Sinise as director was clever in the way he created the feeling of the film, by not explaining too much about George and Lennie's past before they were in the boxcar of the opening sequence, expressing the details of what happened that led to the chase, in quick shots that are supposed to be memories. Sinise also uses Candy's old dog which the men call useless as a simile to Candy's own age and ability to work with only one hand. Eventually the men coerce Candy into letting them put down his dog, to which Candy later commiserates to George that they will not to do him, only firing him, and Candy would then have no way of helping himself. The Music was edited to be playing only in certain parts of the film that were emotionally charged, whether happy like when George was telling Lennie the story about the rabbits, or when danger loomed at the beginning when the boys were being chased out of their old job. Generally the music is very subdued and fades in and out from scene to scene. Most of the time when the men are working or just talking there is no music at all. Generally, Of ""Mice and Men"" is a fantastic drama, telling the story of life in the depression, and societal reactions to those with disabilities. Lennie is the sweetest of characters and only causes trouble because of the way he is. Be sure if you watch this movie, to look for repeated motifs put in place by Sinise, and pay attention to how well the music sets off the emotions of the scenes.",Of Mice and Men
127,phillyeagles526,A truly remarkable peace of art.,10,24 February 2011,"""Guys like us that work on ranches are the loneliest guys in the world. They ain't got no family and they don't belong no place. They got nothing' to look ahead to""... says George. Lennie replies ""But not us, George, because I... see, I got you to look after me, but you got me to look after you."" Of Mice and Men is a book/movie that warms the heart, it tells about a man named George, Gary Sinise, who takes care of his mentally disabled best friend. Without each other you can tell they would be lost, but as one they are the perfect matches. Lennie, played by John Malkovich, is perfectly played; he has the humongous size and is able to act out the mentally disabled part as if he was disabled.Throughout the movie George is seen as a poignant person, first in the beginning he is riding the train going through flashbacks of him and George. This to me showed he loved George and would never do anything to harm him. But as the movie moves into the next scene George and Lennie are walking to the ranch George seems to start to be agitated with Lennie because he doesn't want what they have. Listening to his voice he seems to be fed up with Lenny and his actions which to me seemed a little ruthless considering his mentally disability. Lennie disability left him as a sophomoric person stuck in a giant's body. But as the movie moves along you tend to see George as a very deep person who loves Lennie and knows what he must do. One of the greatest parts of this movie was when slim told George ""A guy don't need no sense to be a nice fella."" To me as a young adult I may portray this different then someone whom is a bit younger or older. I see this, as even though you may not be like everyone else you can still be as nice or nicer then many others.At the pinnacle of the movie Curly's wife, played by Sherilyn Fenn, turns from being one of those not so important actresses to a huge impact on the entire story line. She is one of the reasons why George must kill Lennie, when George learns of Lennie killing Curly's wife he knows Curly will do anything to hunt down and kill Lennie. George remembers Candy, played by Ray Waltson, telling him he should have been the one to kill his dog, at this point George knows he is the only one that can because he is the only one Lennie truly trust with his life. Lenny was the type of person who could not remember anything anyone told him, but anything George told him he could remember. When Lennie came across trouble George told him about this spot near the river, George knew right where Lennie would be. As George reached for the revolver in his pocket he wanted Lennie to have his last memories as happy ones so he told him of the rabbits and the ranch they were going to buy, but as Lenny finished his last sentence George pulled the trigger.This is one book that deserves no chastise remarks, the director of this film, Gary Sinise, chose perfect audio to set the moods and also portrayed precise camera angles that made you feel like you were actually experiencing these events.",Of Mice and Men

In the movie Of Mice and Men, George and Lennie are the main stars as the bounce around from town to town after getting into a heap of trouble. George (Gary Sinise), who is the care taker of Lennie and the wise man in the two, has to keep moving out of every town they move to because of trouble Lennie gets the two in. Lennie (John Malkovich), who is the childish, disabled, takes the work of five different men into one. What a wonderful duo these two make as the two lonely men scavenge the area for jobs. The setting of the movie takes place in Soledad California. After getting into plenty of trouble in Weed, they must be chased out of there and head on the bus to Soledad. From there, they must walk many miles to Tyler Ranch where they get hired for new jobs. Up to this point, Lennie and George have not had any other people close to them. If often seems like as if they only have each other and a sign of loneliness is present. George often times in this play is annoyed with Lennie because he is clueless on what is going on around him. Lennie may be the only thing making George be so lonely. No one would choose a friendless existence on condition of having all the other things in the world.Lennie himself could take the work of five men into one. Lennie is clueless but a great worker. In the movie, Lennie is allowed to keep his own puppy on the ranch. George tells him to not take him out of the barn. George catches him a few times sneaking him out and he must go back into the barn. Lennie had an ardent love for the puppy. When Lennie is frightened by something he will often grab onto something. He will grab on and won't let go. While playing with the puppy, he pets him and squeezes him too much eventually killing the puppy. This is how he also eventually kills Curley's wife. This resembles a tragic flaw from a tragic hero. Curley (Casey Siemaszko), is the antagonist in this movie. He starts many fights with people especially Lennie. One night, he gets into a fight with him and Lennie gets many punches to the head. Lennie comes back and grabs his hand and making it become gnarled. Curley, the owners son, gets weary and Slim tells him a lie saying he got his hand caught in the machine. For Lennie to keep his job, Curley must listen to that. Every night George must tell Lennie a story. He tells him about how they will finally get some money and buy their own house. Lennie always likes to hear about how he will tame the rabbits at the house. Whenever he hears George talk about this, he exults a burst of happiness and gets excited. When Lennie does something wrong, or the indemnity of the damage is severe, Lennie says he will not be able to tame the rabbits no more. Lennie actually understands when he has done something wrong. Loneliness is the major theme of this movie. At the end, George is fed up with Lennie and him getting into trouble all the time. When he kills Curley's Wife, he knows he must do something that will change everything. He finds Lennie on the side of a river just crying. He has him sit and look at the river. George wanted him to only hear the story last. When he says,"" I get to tame the rabbits right George,"" and those were the last words he ever said. George had to kill him. When he kills him, George must take a train ride far away and deviate from the ranch. This is where we understand George is the loneliest people in this play. To be alone is to be different, to be different is to be alone.",Of Mice and Men
129,scolari0620,Of Mice and Men Film Review,9,24 March 2011,"Of Mice and Men Film ReviewGeorge (Gary Sinise) and Lennie (John Malkovich) were running fast, running hard and running away, running away again. Losing their breath, they finally reached the train and jumped into it. Resting, George thinks about how much easier it would be without Lennie. After the sophomoric actions of Lennie ripping a women's dress, the responsibility again falls into George's hands. George's life has revolved around his friend Lennie, and he cannot stop now. Of Mice and Men, a poignant story of two characters who are best friends. Due to Lennie being mentally challenged, George is put into a tough situation and takes care of him. They both do have one ultimate dream; to own a farm and for Lennie to tend the rabbits on it. The movie starts out with George on a train with depressing music in the background, telling you that something bad has happened, along with the time period this is set in. Then it cuts to George and Lennie running away from a town, and a woman running in a ripped red dress. George leads Lennie along a trail to go and find a ranch to work on.At the ranch, the oldest ranch hand, Candy, played by Ray Walston, has an old decrepit dog shot by a fellow rancher named Carlson (Richard Riehle). Lying in bed and hearing the gun shot, Candy regrets that he didn't have the courage to do it himself. This foreshadows when George has to make a huge decision that will affect the way he goes on living. Should he or should he not. After he sees Candy not put his own dog to rest, George knows what to do. Lennie is huge and stronger than any other worker on the farm. Curley (Casey Siemaszko), the owner's son, thinks he is everything and walks around bossing around people. One day an angry Curley saw Lennie and decided to take his anger out on him. After some pushing and shoving, Lennie's monstrous hand completely suppress Curley's fist. Curley's wife (Sherilyn Fenn) asks Lennie what had happened to her husband's hand, but the made up story that everyone is saying is that he got it caught in a machine. This scene in the book was the real climax because after this argument, there was a great deal of tension between the two men.Curley's wife is a very attractive woman who tries to impress all the men that work on the ranch. Due to Curley not showing his love for her, she tries to hit on all the guys who talk to her. Once Curley finds out about people talking, or even going near his wife, he chastises them and threatens revenge. Curley may not show his love for her, but he sure does keep an eye on her to make sure no one touches her. This shows that he is over protective of his wife, making everyone on the farm not like the way he acts towards them.To Lennie, it seems that Curley is a threat. Due to Lennie's problems he gets scared over many things, even the littlest ones. This means that when Curley was yelling at him, he got very frightened and threatening to him. However, George knows that Curley wants to be a reprisal and get another chance to beat up Lennie. Curley is full of himself and thinks he can run the world if got a chance, but he does not realize that Lennie does not know how to control his strength and size and can seriously hurt him. However, George realizes that Lennie may get scared and get beaten down.So what really is going on? Lennie does not remember anything important and keeps getting into trouble, whether it is with Curley's wife, Curley, or anyone else on the ranch. George's job is to make sure Lennie is under control and not causing problems. These two men have a dream. A dream so big to them, it almost seemed impossible to reach. Between fights, arguments, contradictions, all these obstacles made it harder for them to get to this goal, and in the end, you may feel the catharsis of maybe hero, or a betrayer.",Of Mice and Men
130,adamcardonell,Of Mice and Men Review- Adam Cardonell,8,7 April 2011,"Of Mice and Men depicts a story of a strong relationship that comes to a tragic ending. Lennie, a huge, dopey, yet lovable man who does not know his own strength, played by Gary Sinise, and George, his guardian, played by John Malkovich, make John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men come to life. The movie shows off the great acting skills of the cast, the wonderful scenes that the director created, and most of all, its well thought out poignant ending to make Steinbeck's story of George and Lennie a reality up on the big screen. Malkovich, who played Lennie, was a perfect fit. Lennie is written as a strong man that has the mind of a young child in Steinbeck's work, and is captured precisely in the movie. Malkovich's facial expressions and the way he delivers his lines is perfect in fulfilling Lennie's character as he acts juvenile and unaware of things going on around him, yet likable and humorous. After George lies to the farm owner by telling him that he is Lennies cousin, they leave the room and Lennie innocently tells George that they are not cousins, as if George does not know. George was obviously telling a lie to get both himself and Lennie a job on the farm. Gary Sinise also does a great job of acting out his parent like characteristics. Throughout the movie, George acts as a guardian by trying to keep Lennie out of trouble, by telling Lennie his favorite story of how the both of them will one day own their own plot of land and pet bunnies, and by rinsing Lennie's bloodied face after his fight with Curly, the farm owner's vindictive son. Lennie has a mental problem, and George, out of kindness, takes him under his wing. George's character is played flawlessly to show how much he really cares to parent Lennie.Interesting scenes that the director captured were Lennie and George walking to the farm for the first time, and Curly showing his anger toward Lennie when they first met. Lennie and George were shown as tiny dots as they walked along a single dirt road that brought them through the mountains of California. Them being surrounded by huge rocks suggests a theme of loneliness, while the town's name, Soledad, also implies. Loneliness is a central theme because all Lennie and George have throughout the movie is themselves. There are other acquaintances they encounter, but they always have each other deep in their hearts. The scene where Curly first meets Lennie, who has a smirk on his face, Curly becomes angry since Lennie is bigger than he is. Curly steps in between Lennie and George as he starts to harass Lennie. This foreshadows how Curly gets between George and Lennie in the end.Since Lennie accidentally killed Curly's wife, Curly seeks revenge and gathers everyone to help hunt him down. George is determined to find him first so that he can kill him himself. George has to kill Lennie himself because earlier in the book a character named Carlson and Slim persuade Candy to kill his dog for him since it was old and had problems. After Carlson killed Candy's dog, Candy said that he wished that he had killed his dog himself since he raised that dog from a pup and was so attached to it. This predicts the actions of George and why he has the desire to kill Lennie himself, and also since George knows Curly is going to kill him anyway if he doesn't first. Lennie was so deep into trouble this time that George was not able to get him out of it. This bittersweet moment was done perfectly since George knows he had to let him go. George told Lennie his favorite story for the last time, and killed him right after his favorite part; the bunnies they are going to own. Lennie dies happy, but most tragically, the strong friendship between Lennie and George get destroyed.The Of Mice and Men movie brings all of the thrills Steinbeck creates in his writing and is truly authentic to Steinbeck's work. From the actors, to the director and emotional ending, the Of Mice and Men movie honorably serves Steinbeck's classic story of the two drifters, George and Lennie, in the 1930's.",Of Mice and Men
131,jtquinn95,Two men find work on a ranch where they hope to raise enough money to live out a simple dream.,9,9 April 2011,"Many know the story of John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men as a portrayal of loneliness and of how even the most thought out plans can go awry because of a small mistake. With scenery that perfectly matches the book's descriptions and actors who make the audience believe their characters, this film is accurate in its interpretation of the original text. Rather than try to change the story to fit in with modern day films, the director has chosen to portray the story as it was written, which keeps the original story intact. From this film, the story is given new life without losing any of its original greatness. The actors who star in the film not only fit the physical descriptions of their characters from the story, but also flawlessly interpret and become their characters, making their performances much more believable. When Curley (Casey Siemaszko) is violently harassing Lennie (John Malkovich), Malkovich is able to display the fear and confusion that Lennie feels before unleashing his true strength and crushing the hand of his adversary. This sudden twist from an innocent to a frightening character takes the audience for an emotional ride because Malkovich is able to portray both of these contrasting characteristics. Casey Siemaszko, whose character is averse to almost everyone, seems to become his character as the small but belligerent son of the ranch owner who picks fights and earns himself a gruesome injury to his hand. Gary Sinise does an excellent job at playing George, a character who is not infallible but tries to care for Lennie and is truly torn over making a gargantuan sacrifice. All of the actors' performances truly coincide to create a cast of characters who fit together as seamlessly as they did in the original story. With such believable acting, Steinbeck's original novella is brought to life on the silver screen.The director employs filming techniques that match the mood set by Steinbeck's original descriptions and makes the audience feel as though they are in Steinbeck's original story. The film goes from beautiful scenes of nature to dry, dusty fields and hot, sunny days filled with men at work that portray to the audience the difficult times of the Great Depression. Even shadows are used in certain scenes to create feelings of mystery and suspense. One scene that uses visual artistry is the beginning which shows beams of light cast on George's face while he sits in the dark on a train. The music of this scene is slow and eerie and the scene is shown again at the end of the film. At the beginning, this scene hints that a horrible event has just happened and at the end, adds to the shock of what George has done. Not only does the cinema artistry of this film make it a work of art in itself, but also helps the movie live up to the original mood set by the novella.The film not only stands out because of the acting and film techniques, but also because of the simplicity of the movie. Since the director did not try to alter the original story, the result is a film that twists the emotions of the audience in the same way as the original novella. Trying to alter the story so it could seem more modern would ruin the story because it is not set in modern times. Not trying to make the story more modern and relatable to the audience makes the film just as direct as the original novella and prevents the story from becoming a ridiculous version of its former self.This film remains true to the original book and maintains the value of the original story through exquisite acting, film techniques, and no unnecessary changes made to the plot. The original story is preserved through this film as it brings this timeless classic to a new generation. Vivid characters are brought to life by the actors who flawlessly become their characters as they were in the novella. The story remains intact but still interesting even though the time period that the story takes place in is no longer relevant to the people of today. The film Of Mice and Men is triumphant because it takes Steinbeck's original work and adapts it to the big screen without losing its original feeling and message, allowing the story to be seen as it was meant to be read.",Of Mice and Men

Had initial doubts about John Malkovich playing this role but he is such a good actor - he was brilliant. Scenery was also magnificent. Not sure where it was filmed but that farm and those field scenes were beautiful. Gary Sinise played his part well as the protective, thought provoking friend. Men working together during hard times in harsh conditions is portrayed well as they go about their daily labour. ""Slim"" was a good man to have as a boss and you felt for poor old Candy as he neared the end of his working days.

I love this scene because it shows that Lennie is actually smart in some ways by being able to think of something like that. Another scene in Of Mice and Men that stuck out to me was the part where George blows up on Lennie for saying hat he liked beans with ketchup, because it was kind of funny how Lennie just stood afterwords got an attitude about George ""stealing"" is mouse.

135,tares-316,it sick,10,28 June 2013,"""Of mice and men"" is one of these movies we definitely need in our times.Gary Sinise 's directing is classic in the noblest sense of the term.The cinematography recalls some of those Ford (who adapted ""Grapes of wrath"",another Steinbeck's novel for the screen) gems of the forties or fifties.It is heart-rending to see Malkovich and his portrayal of the half-wit is one of the finest you can see in a nineties movies and leaves,for instance Dustin Hoffman's ""rain man"" character far behind.It takes a lot of guts to play such demeaning parts !Gary Sinise should not be forgotten either,in a performance which offers all the subtleties of the heart.What moves me in the movie is the loneliness which frightens the characters .Everyone is searching for someone to rely on.Not only the two heroes (I think that ,actually, George needs more Lennie than the other way about)but also the old man -the scene with the old dog is almost unbearable;it will have an equivalent in a terrifying way at the end recalling Horace MacCoy's ""they shoot horses don't they?""- Curley's wife;only the black guy has resigned himself to solitude.The scene when Candy and the two pals are talking of their future house -which we know from the very start they'll never have- is really heartwarming.At least,for one precious and fleeting moment,they could dream of a home,a fireplace and a hutch full of rabbits.",Of Mice and Men
136,stephanie-vee,A great story that should be watched.,10,26 September 2013,"Wow. I never knew I would like this movie so much! It is a very emotional story, based on the novella of the same name by John Steinbeck. For Year 9 English, I had to read this book. I read it a couple of times before we started it in class and I didn't really like it. In fact, didn't like it at all. But as we discussed the book in class, I started to understand it more and like it better. After the class had finished reading the book, we would have to write an essay on it, we could take in half a page of quotes on it. Now I thought hell, I'm not reading it for the 4th time, so I thought I'd watch the movie. I am so glad I did. It is a great movie, the characters are PERFECT. George (Gary Sinise, was also one of the directors of the film) and Lennie (John Malkovich) were great as the two stars. The movie was put together really well. I loved it. Some people complain about the very few changes made, I think they were changed for the better (especially the ending). Some also complain about John Malkovich's acting, some say he is over reacting too much and also saw a review where someone said John is too 'intelligent' for the role. If that is the case, he is a damn good actor (as well as a 'damn good worker', says George). I think John pulled off Lennie's part splendidly. I could go on all day about how great this is, but I only have a 1000 word limit.The movie is pretty much the same as the book, with like I said, a few minor changes. (I ended up reading the book again, just in case) It is my new favourite movie and book surprisingly. It is very rare nowadays to find a movie with some sincere meaning, this is one of those rare movies. I would most definitely recommend this movie. But if you are into fancy effects, action and all that stuff, this is not for you. If you like an emotional, meaningful story of friendship, this is the movie to watch. So grab yourself some popcorn and sit down. If you are the type to get really emotional, have a box of tissues in reach, just in case. 10/10 for a beautiful story. I think Steinbeck would be proud.",Of Mice and Men
137,limbick1,Of Mice and Men,8,1 February 2005,"I saw the movie Of mice and Men and I thought I was really good. i have also read the novel by John Steinbeck. I was upset about on specific thing in the movie. I thought it didn't do justice to the novel as it didn't completely capture the relationship between George and Lennie. I thought it could have shown how important their relationship was to each other and how much each character relied on the other.I especially thought that this wasn't shown at the end of the movie when George had to shoot Lennie in the head and didn't really show much hesitation, but in the novel it seemed much more drawn out where it made it seem much more harder for George to kill Lennie.",Of Mice and Men
138,jmarika,Woot!,8,7 February 2014,"This movie was very interesting to watch during our English class. I thought how the beginning start off with them being chased by the dogs was pretty radical. Also the director added a scene between Curley's wife and George which wasn't in the book. For example, when Lennie kills her in the book it was different how I pictured it in the book. Another example is that how George kills Lennie is kinda brutal to how the book described. I thought that George would go slowly during the conversation but instead he just kind of whips out his gun and shoots Lennie in the back of the head. Thats what I thought of this book, worth watching.Great movie",Of Mice and Men

When George shoots Lennie at the end, it is shocking, and adds a twist to the whole story. The actors portrayed the characters very well, and Lennie is just as slow as I would have expected. George is just as harsh as I thought he would've been. While he is harsh however, he opens up to Lennie at the end and it is very similar to what he does in the book also. Also, the story line is the same as the book, and the books and movies don't seem like they make each other worse. Also, all of the characters represent their role in the book well. For instance, Slim is a hard-working boss, who seems to decently care for his workers. In the movie, this is exactly what is portrayed, and really adds to the quality of the Movie. The movie has it's sad points, and has a great variety. For instance, like I said before, when George shoots Lennie, it is both a major shock and a major disappointing point. Lennie was an easily lovable character, and to go out like that would be very harsh. Overall, this movie is a great one.",Of Mice and Men

This movie followed the book very well, unlike most movies based off books do. Although i do have to complain about the ended, it didn't match up with the book quite so well. Lennie death was suppose to be George slowly lining up the gun to the part on Lennie's neck. But in the movie George just killed him very quickly. However I can not complain at all with this overall movie, I enjoyed it very much; it was what i was picturing in my head when i read the book. It was nice how they elaborated more on Curly's wife part and made her seem more compassionate and just seeking someone to talk to. That is why I rated this movie an 8 out of 10, and would very much recommended it to someone.",Of Mice and Men

The actor who played Lennie was really spot on for me and fit the image in my head perfectly. Although, the ending was a little disappointing compared to what occurred in the book. I feel as though they could have elaborated more and not make it so abrupt. The one downside I feel is that it all moved a little fast. Being aware of the size of the book, it would sure make sense but I feel it could have been more elaborated and the scenes could have been extended more.

I watched this movie for my English class and I feel it was a pretty good movie. Even though, some scenes were added and some scenes were inaccurate and moved too fast. For example, I was not happy that the director rushed the scene when George decided to shoot Lennie. In the book, George was really slow and precise about it. But in the movie, George starts telling Lennie about how they will live on their own farm and then picks up Carlson's gun and shots Lennie in the head. Also the movie didn't end the way the book ended with the men finding George and the dead Lennie and then tell George that he did the right thing. Instead, the movie ended with a flashback to when George and Lennie were working together. Other than some of the inaccuracies, it was a good movie that is a good supplement to reading the book.",Of Mice and Men

Also the movie seemed almost like you weren't engaged in it. The movie had some very good parts though like the whole thing that the entire movie was a flash back was very interesting and it was a big shocker. Over all the movie was a pretty decent one. The characters were very similar to the book which I read a short time before I watched the movie. The story line of the movie drifted away from the book a little with a few short scenes that weren't even in the book. I found the acting of the main characters to be very good in the movie, although the characters with smaller parts in the movie weren't very good at acting.",Of Mice and Men

Reading the book before the movie is a great idea. This would give you some background knowledge about the movie, and would give you a great comparison. However, you don't have to read the book to enjoy the movie. The movie displays adventure, friendship, and the life of two men. The movie captures your attention the entire time, and really warms your heart. Lennie is a character that captures your heart, and you really feel for Lennie throughout the entire book. George, is the type of character you have a love/hate relationship with. These twos adventures in the movie really have you on the edge of the seat. If you don't like violence this movie isn't for you. If you want a heart warming story I highly recommend this movie. Has a great plot twist at the end!",Of Mice and Men

I liked the story behind it. I liked the story of George and Lennie's friendship, and how they cared for each other, and protected each other. They always cared for each other, no matter what. Also, the actors and actresses did a realistic job at playing their roles. However, I did not like that not everything that was in the film was the same thing that happened in the book.

Although he didn't look the same in my head, Lennie was slow and didn't understand everything spoken to him. He was large and kinda doofy looking, just like I imagined. The same goes with the other cast members also. They did the scenes just as I imagined. However I did not like the ending.

The whole movie itself was very easy to understand, and flowed nicely.I like how you could feel many emotions while watching and reading, although I do not like how the book ended. I think that George shooting Lennie was a horrible choice for an ending. I felt it was unnecessary and could have played out better. Why didn't Lennie and George just run away and start over again? Why didn't Lennie Candy and George leave early and go get the house with the rabbits right then? What was the point of killing Lennie when all it did was cause George MORE paint than it would if they just ran away and started over again. These are just some of the things that made me give the movie an 8 out of 10 instead of a 10 out of 10. Otherwise this was a amazing book and movie and is a must watch/read!",Of Mice and Men

All of the characters, except for Lennie, were exactly as I pictured them while reading the novel. From the book, I thought Lennie to be much younger than he was in the movie. I liked the book better than the movie mainly due to the end. In the novel, it seemed to me that George killed Lennie after they talked about the house for a little longer, whereas in the movie, the murder of Lennie seemed to be much more abrupt. Although certain parts of the movie didn't match up with the book, I still thought that it deserved an 8/10 since most of the events did match up.

SPOILERS AHEAD: When Curleys wife dies in the book he is more sad than angry.Also at the end of the book when George is telling Lennie about there soon to be home it is more stretched out. I'm not saying this ruined the movie, it's just a lot more noticeable. I give this movie a 6.5 out of 10 due to it having a lack of emotion and some of the actors weren't the best choices. Sorry for people that disagree with me but I think they could have done a lot better with this movie. I give the book on the other hand 9 out of 10 because I get into the book a lot more than I do watching the movie. I recommend the book over the movie.

They were hardly noticeable. For example, some parts of the movie were acted differently than in the book. Like, when the puppy died, Lennie didn't care in the book. But, in the movie he did care. Also, the ending of the book was ruined. The dramatic ending of the movie was ruined. For example, the book had a long dramatic sad ending before George pulled the trigger. However, in the movie the ending was short and was nothing like the book. Therefore from my prospective the ending was ruined. But, Overall the movie was pretty good.

Plus, the very beginning was very different than the story, and I didn't know what was going on.

I did not at all feel disappointed about the movie after reading the book. The movie really did the great book the justice that it deserved.

They are very very similar and i do like that a lot. I truly was shocked with the ending because i imagined it differently. It seemed not as good of an ending because of how quickly it ended to sadly. Also i liked the details in the book more. That's why i give it only a 6 because of how it was acted out and things. the characters where much different like Lennie and George, i expected Lennie as a younger guy which was really talk and bulky and George older in his like mid 40's.

154,bonzo99911,This version of 'Of mice and men' is a total crap!,6,22 April 2005,"The movie didn't convey much of what made the novel ""Of Mice and Men"" very unique. Of course, it contained much of that so-called American stuffs that all the classics and the movies of 90's used to have; the mystic night-talk with your best friend, that swaying southern accent, etc etc.. However the director missed out the 'Core Details' by having an Ex-Frankenstein as Lennie; he should be more like a tall, simple minded young man with just usual appearance, not a crazy old retard who makes the audiences sick to their stomach. And he also ruined the ending by choosing some dirty swampy region for the place where Goerge shoots Lennie, instead of an open windy spot where Lennie could almost see his dream -""living off the fatta lan'""- coming true before he dies by the bullet fired by his best friend who wants to spare him from all the pain he would suffer when Curley catches him. And further more, George should have the voice of Moe -Moe in ""The Simpsons""- when he yells at Lennie in the Salinas river for annoying him too much, and he also should look much more painful and tired all the time, to convey the loneliness of being ""George"". The one in this movie is way too handsome and way too imperial to be 'George'.I guess the only good thing about this movie is the post plastered all over the English classrooms.

The plot of the film is that Lenny and George are always on the run. Lenny always gets George into trouble simply because he just doesn't know any better. The film did a great job showing that George and Lenny really cared for and protected each other. Although some of the most important details in the book were lacking in the film. Such as aspects of the book which really help you to understand each character were not shown in the film. The actors did an incredible job, I was really drawn into the story and was very moved.

158,xhjiangchen,Excellent Film!,10,3 December 2015,"This film is about two ranchers called George and Lennie, who had to change their work again and again because of the crazy problems Lennie gets in. This is a period drama film. The main characters in this film are Lennie Small, played by John Malkovich and George Milton, played by Gary Sinise. There are other important characters, such as Candy (Ray Waltson) or Curley (Casey Siemaszko). I think this film is really successful, as it represents really well most of the scenes from and the book, although the characters wasn't the same as it was described in the book. In the film, John Malkovich was ideal for the role of Lennie Small. This character in particular stood out because he acted the same as the book. In the book this character was just like a baby, while in the film it represented identically. I the film we can see Lennie as a strong man but acting as a child of 7-8 years old. The character George Milton played by Gary Sinise had an excellent throughout too because he was just the same as in the book, acting as Lennie's father. I think the best part in the middle of the film, where we can see that George and Lennie has settled in the ranch and Lennie was having fun with his new puppy. The film was different to the novel, as it didn't have the same beginning and final as the book. In the book it began when George and Lennie was in their way to their new ranch and it ended when Candy called George to go for a drink after killing Lennie, and in the film it began when Lennie got into trouble in the last ranch and finished when George killed Lennie and left the ranch. The film was really entertaining, as the music effects were set very good. The worse part of the film was when kill Lennie, because I don't think killing Lennie was the best idea. Also I think Curley's wife wasn't acting as well, because in the book she an unkind woman. I think they should also have changed a bit the final and not just finished with George leaving the ranch. In conclusion the film is really good and interesting. I think everyone who are learning American history in the 20th century or interested in it, they should watch this film, but also I recommend this film to everyone, as it is excellent. I would give the film 5 stars out of 5!",Of Mice and Men
159,ikliuchivskaia,"Review of the film ""Of Mice and Men""",7,8 December 2015,"The story ""Of Mice and Men"" is a story about people who dream for the future. The genre of the film is drama, because there are sad moments.The main characters are Lennie and George. The actors are John Malkovich , he played Lennie and Gary Sinuse who played George. In my opinion the film was not really successful because it was a little bit short compared to the book and not all details were included into the film. All actors played very well, but Gary Sinuse did better job, because it is a quit hard to act like George. The best part of the film is when Curley realized what happened with his wife and who did it. The film very different to a novel, we imaged some characters differently and the story in a novel at the end a bit continue.We did not image characters in a novel as they were different in the film.There was not boring moment at all in the film.The ending of the film should be done as the ending in the book , it is a little bit differently. I liked the film, but I think it would be better if in the film will has some changing and would more similar to the novel.I think people from fourteen years old would interested watch ""Of Mice and Men"".

It is a period drama. The main characters are George(Gary Sinise), Lennie (John Michovich) and Candy(Ray Walston). I think this film is successful the background and the actor can show us really real the old time in America. I think George do the best in the film ,because when Lennie do something wrong he always to protect him and always take care of Lennie. I think the best part of the film it is the ending of the film is Lennie kill Curley's wife and he run away, George going to find Lennie and meet Lennie one last time and kill him, it can show us George like a father make Lennie feel safe one last time George have no chose he mast kill him. The film can more strong to show us the the feeling and the story. The setting can entertains me at all because the background setting is really real to show us 1992s in America. I think the most boring moment is George and Lennie get out the bus and walk to the ranch and they live next to a small river and George told Lennie something about them house in the future, I think there is the most boring moment in this story. I think Curley is incorrect because he doesn't put up a man who is a rich man' son he doesn't put up he was felt proud. He should put up more proud and more different with others I think. But actually it was a good film, I think there will be some teenagers be interesting who finish to read this book. If five point is the full mark I will give this film 4 point.",Of Mice and Men
161,stanev-07570,Of Mice and Men review,7,8 December 2015,"'Of Mice and Men' is about two guys who had just changed the ranch they worked at because Lennie caused trouble. It's genre is period drama. The main character are Lennie, the big baby, who is played by John Malkovich and George, the small guy, who is played by Gary Sinise. In my opinion the film is successful, because the act was very well done.I think the character that did the best was Lenie, because acting stupid is not an easy thing. The best part of the movie is when Lennie crushes Curley's hand because at first Lennie had to act frightened, what he did well, and then he had to act furious, in which he did again good job. The film starts and ends different from the novel. One particularly successful aspect of the film is that there weren't almost any special effects. The camera was always positioned on the right angle.I think the worst part from the movie was when Curley's wife came at the field where the boys were working and began asking questions about her husbands' hand (Curley). I think the portrayal of Curley's wife was incorrect because in the movie she is not as bad described as in the book. They could have made her look worse like in the book.My overall opinion is that the film is quite good, although there were some parts that were not good.

That being said, I was pleasantly surprised by the casting, directing, and content of this movie. The story held true to John Steinbeck's original work down to much of the dialog. The film elicited the same emotions I felt when I first read the book as a child.John Malkovich's portrayal of Lenny was at times seemingly forced, but it worked well even if it was not consistent with the novel. I also envisioned Lenny as a much larger individual, given his enormous strength.

Some characters are not credible, it kinda ruins it because they're important in the story. Malkovich's performance is great, Sinise is good but some of his lines just feel out of place, especially in the beginning.

165,hysm,Review of a Friendship,8,28 November 2005,"In this movie, it portrayed a friendship that I thought would never end. Lenny and George were two people that were inseparable and looked after each other. They were very wise in picking John Malcovich and Gary Senise to play Lenny and George. The movie starts with George and Lenny running away from men on horses and end up in a train car. They get off and end up in a town; they go onto a bus, which will take them to their job. They end up on the Tyler Ranch and meet many characters. As the movie goes on you get to find how George and Lenny came to be friends and how they lead up to where the movie starts. However, by the end of the movie, Lenny kills the wife of the son of the ranch and runs away. The last part of the movie was spectacular and gave me a tear in my eye.Both Gary Senise and John Malcovich gave each part of the movie so perfect and were very precise. They put so much emotion in their parts and it was as if I was there experiencing it for myself. Lenny was a part in the movie that showed so much passion and kindness toward George and it was not one time in the movie that he would hurt George. George was like a father figure toward Lenny and guided him throughout the whole movie. They were friends at the beginning of the movie; at the end of the movie, they would remain friends until the very end. This is must see by any kind of person who wants to see two people go through everything as a team.",Of Mice and Men
166,brennand-72918,Garbage,4,27 November 2017,"Never have I ever seen a movie so aged and forgettable as Of Mice and Men. I've read the book and loved it, but book vs. movie aside. All this film has to offer is cheesy affection and overly aggressive acting. I may be biased due to my distaste for Sinise. All I think of when I watch this movie is The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, another decently great text turned into a bad movie by a Director/Main Actor. In that film being, Ben Stiller. Book to film adaptations need to stop being done by bland actors who are only supported by one or two huge roles (that may not even be that good).",Of Mice and Men
167,mwmmwm2,Where can I find this movie?,10,15 February 2006,"""Of Mice and Men"" is a good novel for readers of all ages and a particularly excellent film, i.e. the version with Gary Sinese and John Malkovich. However, my problem is.... where can I get this DVD? I am resident in China and a year or two ago I was able to find it. Now it is the most elusive DVD to locate. This movie is a classic and the book is just the right length to be perfect for English Literature classes for students of good and not so good ability. Why should it be hidden away? At present no one is able to view it. The promoters of this DVD should be doing their jobs and creating access to it. Who is getting any benefit if is hidden in a secret location? I have shown this movie before and everyone loves it. Please help me find this movie because it is good in its own right and a perfect adaptation of the book. Literature and language students are the poorer for the lack of promotion.",Of Mice and Men
168,u-96328,Beautiful and timeless,8,24 February 2019,"We need more movies like this: honest about real life, not sugarcoated, not dramatized. I feel like everyone who worked on this movie didn't do it because they wanted to make a blockbuster movie that everyone was clamoring to see again and again. They made this movie because they had a story they wanted to tell. The book is a classic, the movie is just as timeless. It felt honest.... wholesome.... All the way through.",Of Mice and Men
169,hanmillssss,Great Movie!,8,26 February 2019,"The film Of Mice And Men is a great film that was directed by Gary Sinise in 1992. This film was during the Great Depression, and Lennie (John Malkoviah) and George (Gary Sinise) are looking for work. They eventually find work, but after being there for a while Lennie causes thins to go South, after telling George he'd be good.In Of Mice And Men, George and Lennie get drove out of a place called ""Weed"", and had to find a new place to work. They find a new place to work and it is all going good, Yet they do have a few problems, but everything goes South when Lennie accidentally does something bad.The film is a very good one. It is sad at times but other than that it is good. Lennie and George look out for each other, but it's mainly George looking out for Lennie since he is a childlike man, and they are funny. Yet, some of the guys are assholes, such as Curley.My thoughts on this film are good. I liked he film personally.It is a very fast paced film and it was straight to the point. The movie followed the book very well but did have some different scenarios. It is very sad at two or three points in the movie but other than that it is good. I HIGHLY recommend this movie.",Of Mice and Men

Some of the Major actors that did pretty good John Malkovich, Horton Foote, Ray Walston.Two very close friends going on a working venter. Lennie Smalls is a very soft giant with is care taker named George Milton. George tries and keeps Lennie out of trouble, but he just does not listen.The one thing that stands out on this movie is that Candy has a hand and in the book he doesn't have one.",Of Mice and Men
172,S2DMGames,Amazing... Truly Amazing...,10,26 February 2019,"This movie directed by Gary Sinise is amazing. This movie tells the story of George And Lennie, 2 guys looking for work. It puts emphasis on the characters and the acting is spot on. In my opinion, this movie is the best movie I've ever seen! The components of the movie with all the genres put together into this movie make it a perfect blend of what people like. So if I were to recommend this movie, I would! It's worth every second!",Of Mice and Men
173,kempalex-10955,Film Review,5,26 February 2019,"Of mice and men was published in 1992. The book was written by John Steinbach in 1937. In the book Lennie causes some trouble with Curleys wife, and George is left to clean things up behind Lennie. George and Lennie travel all over working. Lennie always finds trouble no matter what. They are always on the move. All lennie wants is to have rabbits and live off the fat of the land. But everything lennie touches dies. The ending to this movie is horrible and i believe there couldve been more action in the plot.",Of Mice and Men
174,carliemyers,Very emotional movie that gives you good insight on what living during great depression was like.,8,26 February 2019,"Of Mice and Men was written as a book then turned into a movie in 1992. It is set back in the 1930 during the Great Depression. With John Malkovich starring as Lennie a big disable man with a mindset of a child and Grey Sinise starring as George his best friend who watches after him. During the Great Depression it is hard to make money and even harder to have your own land. You do not usually see men working together from place to place, but George and Lennie are not like usual men. George and Lennie have to stick together to help each other out and keep Lennie away from homes for disable people and out of trouble. Lennie is about thirty five but has a mindset of a six year old. He keeps making mistakes and George has to pay the price, but the mistakes that Lennie make are not all his fault he can not help himself. The two both have to go through tough situations in which not all have a good out come. The film overall is good it gives you a vision of what it was like living in the great depression and with someone with a mental disability. It shows the roles of what certain people have. The only thing that I do not agree with is how George has to make a very difficult decision and the action he takes.",Of Mice and Men
175,trentdekle,watch it,8,26 February 2019,"The movie the mice and men was made in 1992. The director was Gary sinise.
I loved everything about the movie. These are two of the best charactors actors you're going to see. itinerant worker george reflects on the time he spent traveling with Lennie a huge childlike man. The two men drift through California during the great depression, looking for work.",Of Mice and Men
176,athompson-82402,"Watch it, its good",9,26 February 2019,"Mice of men, 1992. director-gary sinise, writer- john steinbeck, major actors- john malkaich as lennie, gary sinise as george, ray walston as candy.lennie and george try and find some work and get paid and lennie gets in trouble. george and lennie travels together trying to find work on a ranch, they had a job at weed but lennie got in trouble and they had to run away and now they are trying to find a new ranch to work on. i thought the movie was funny and sad and exiting, i recommend this film because it teaches a lesson and is serous but funny at parts too",Of Mice and Men
177,bishopjarrell-25773,Pretty good movie,7,26 February 2019,"The movie was a pretty good movie. The movie was based in the in the 1930's. Lennie and George live the life of traveling men looking for work. Lennie has a metal disability resulting in him always getting in the way or in trouble, but George always finds a way to figure things out. Until one day Lennie takes it to far.The movie is slowing going. The action doesn't start till the end but it is worth the wait. I recommend this movie to anybody that is interested in how life was back in that time.",Of Mice and Men
