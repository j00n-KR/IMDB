0,MartinHafer,"Too much Julie, not enough Julia...but still worth seeing.",7,3 January 2010,"This film is about two parallel journeys—Julia Child's creation of a magnificent cookbook and Julie's following all the recipes in the book in one harried year. The story was set, at times, in the present and much of it consisted of Meryl Streep doing a magnificent impersonation of Ms. Child—so good that at times it was quite touching and beautiful.I liked that this movie chose an unusual method to tell the story by bouncing back and forth from Julie's life in the present to Julia Child's life in the 1940s and 50s. The problem for me, however, was not the style of telling the story but that I felt little, if any, connection to Julie and really wanted to know so much more about Julia. Maybe some of this is because my wife, like Julia Child, is an author and it just seemed like Julie was piggybacking off Ms. Child's success. In other words, Julie didn't really DO anything of her own and made a name for herself solely by recreating recipes by another person. This seemed to go far beyond just 'fan fiction' and on top of this, I really didn't like this character all that much—though, with Amy Adams in this part, it's hard to hate her because of Adams' bubbly and nice persona.So why, despite this major complaint, did I still give the movie a 7? Well, the portions with Meryl Streep deserved a 10—they were wonderful and I really, really wanted to see a lot more of this. In fact, I wish the whole Julie plot had been removed and it simply been the story of Julia Child.PERIOD. I would have loved to have heard more about Ms. Child's pain in not being able to have children as well as see more about her loving and sweet relationship with her husband. These portions in the movie, though WAY TOO BRIEF, were quite touching and made me shed a few tears. As for Amy Adams, she did a good job with what she was given, but she wasn't given much. Her character seemed shallow and a bit self-involved. Think about itthis lady was willing to lose her husband over a dream that, to me, seemed silly and not terribly important. All too often, I found myself hating this character—and wanting to see so much more of Streep as Julia Child. Plus, I really wanted to know WHY Ms. Child did NOT approve of Julie's blog. I think I can guess why, but just glossing over this briefly near the end seemed unsatisfying.Overall, this is a very, very well-crafted story with great acting and directionbut a story that seemed inadequate and could have used a re-workingwithout Julie.",Julie & Julia
1,TheLittleSongbird,Culinary deliciousness,8,17 September 2017,"With talented actors such as Meryl Streep, Amy Adams, Stanley Tucci and Jane Lynch on board, plus Nora Ephron has been responsible for some lovely work, 'Julie & Julia' seemed a recipe made in heaven. Seeing it, it is truly delicious stuff.Do agree with those saying that the Julia Child portions are much more interesting than the Julie Powell ones. Not that the Julie Powell scenes are unwatchable, certainly not. There are amusing and sweet moments and succeeds just as much as the Julia Child story in making one want to grab a cook-book and start cooking or starting a blog. The film in general with both story lines compels one to want to cook, regardless of how good they are at it or not.Amy Adams also brings charm to Julie and an amusing angst and Chris Messina is likable support, though the character is underwritten somewhat. Their chemistry is nicely done.What lets it down however are silly scenes like with the dinner and 65 answer phone messages, pacing that lacked lustre in places and the shallow self-absorbed way Julie particularly is written.Luckily, the Julia Child portions have much more charm and are easier to relate to, with Julia's obstacles and determinations being easier to root for and Julia being a more endearing character. The scenes have so much warmth and makes one laugh in an uplifting fashion and cry in how delicately and sensitively the subject is portrayed.Meryl Streep gives yet another masterly performance, that's both hilarious and touching and much more than an impersonation even with the mannerisms, voice and such being spot on. She is not as tall as Child was, who was 6 foot 2 to Streep's 5 foot 6, but 'Julie & Julia' cleverly disguised that by basically casting shorter actors and actresses. Stanley Tucci is equally brilliant as her husband, one really believes that they are in love and Tucci charms the socks out of everybody. Jane Lynch is a welcome presence in a small role as Dorothy.The only problems with her story are that it occasionally sags in the middle and that the Republican/McCarthyism jibes did come over as mean-spirited and unnecessary.'Julie & Julia' is beautifully filmed, especially in the Julia story, which also has very evocative and handsomely rendered period detail that feels like late 40s-50s France. The music gives a good taste of the uplifting and the tragic, with brilliant use of ""Time After Time"". Am not a fan of the very overplayed ""Prince of Denmark"" march but tolerated it here.Nora Ephron's directing in the film's best parts is some of the best she ever did in my opinion and in the best parts the script is witty, inspiring, poignant and sharply observant with lots of warmth. Much of the story works really well, with the two stories and time lines intertwined with great skills and never is hard to follow or choppy.Overall, culinary deliciousness if at times uneven. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Julie & Julia
2,SnoopyStyle,Nora Ephron expertly weaves two stories together,7,23 November 2013,"Julie Powell (Amy Adams) is a writer tired of her job. On the suggestion of her husband Eric Powell (Chris Messina), she starts writing a blog to tackle all of Julia Child's (Meryl Streep) recipes in one year. The movie also shows Julia's life with her husband Paul (Stanley Tucci).Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci masterfully recreates the love between Julia and Paul Child. They are great together. Amy Adams is the epitome of likability. She is wonderful especially when things go wrong. The trick is to weave together the story of these two married women. Nora Ephron is able to maintain both stories' momentum while giving them a relationship. The only problem is that the ending doesn't have quite the dramatic punch. But it ends sweetly and that's all it needs.",Julie & Julia
3,Hitchcoc,Just There for Meryl,8,2 March 2010,"When I was in college, one of my drama professors told me that Julia was his favorite TV show. I thought at the time he was talking about the incredibly dull series starring Diahan Carroll. Since he was a man of some girth, I came to realize he was talking about Julia Child's French Chef show. He later said he gained five pounds just watching it. I have since watched many of these shows and have to admit that Meryl Streep pretty much became this woman on the screen. That voice of scratching nails on the blackboard, that physical presence. I can't believe this actress whom we take for granted. The plot is silly and cute, and it maintains our interest as to whether Julie can keep her marriage together and fulfill her goal. There are also the politics of the French. Nevertheless, contrary to what others have said, I wasn't put off by the length and just enjoyed an actress that seems able to play just about anyone.",Julie & Julia
4,Prismark10,Cooking up a stew,6,1 February 2014,"This is really two films with a soft heart but no centre.Julie Powell (Amy Adams) is a wannabe writer working for a government agency but with friends who have more high powered lives.Julie has moved to a small apartment above a pizza shop and starts to blog at the suggestion of her husband. Her task is to cook recipes from a book by Julia Child (Meryl Streep) in one year.At the same time we have scenes of Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci who plays her husband getting used to life in Paris where he is a diplomat and she tries to find a purpose. She does this when she learns French cooking and eventually begins to collaborate on her book on French cooking.The scenes between Streep and Tucci are very good especially the Parisian scenes.The Adams scenes being set in the early days of the internet means she became a sensation by trying out all the recipes in the book with all the later trauma associated with it.However Nora Ephron lacks the hard edge as a director to make this film any more than amiable. Her use of songs in the film demonstrates this, it really is literal.Adams, Tucci, Streep and Messina give excellent performances but a better director would have done better.",Julie & Julia
5,claudio_carvalho,Mastering the Art of French Cooking,6,27 August 2011,"In 1949, the diplomat Paul Child (Stanley Tucci) and his wife Julia (Meryl Streep) are expatriated to France. In Paris, the bored Julia decides to learn how to cook and later to write a book teaching American housewives how to cook French cuisine. In 2002, the frustrated secretary of a government agency Julie (Amy Adams) and her husband, the editor Eric Powell (Chris Messina) move to an apartment in Queens over a pizzeria. Julie is an aspirant writer and loves to cook and her husband suggests her to write a blog to spend her leisure time. Julie decides to write a blog about cooking and commits herself to cook the 534 recipes written by Julia Child in her book in 365 days.""Julie & Julia"" discloses in parallel, two true stories about two unsuccessful women in different times that have found realization in life through cooking. The annoying character performed by Meryl Streep probably had that weird way of speaking and is boring. Amy Adams is sweet as usual in the role of a copycat of the successful cooker. The result is an average film that entertains. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Julie & Julia""",Julie & Julia
6,gavin6942,"Good, But Disjointed",7,12 February 2010,"We are treated to dual stories: Julia Child, spending time in France, learns to cook the French way and wishes to bring it back to Americans. Forty years later, Julie pledges to cook her way through Julia's cookbook in one year (and over one recipe a day). The stories do not, for the most part, overlap.This film got some attention for Meryl Streep's portrayal of Julie Child, for which she was Oscar-nominated. And, admittedly, she does a fine job. Amy Adams, who plays Julie, also does a fine job (but looks nothing like her real-life counterpart). Beyond the acting, it's a so-so movie. I freely admit I liked it, but the substance is nothing special, unless you like stories about people cooking or getting famous for writing a blog.I guess if Meryl Streep wins the Oscar, you should check it out for her performance... and if you're sort of curious on Julia Child's history, and have no interest in reading Wikipedia or a book... although the film really tones down her involvement with the Central Intelligence Agency (or OSS). I think that's a great mistake, but at least she doesn't exaggerate like Chuck Barris.",Julie & Julia
7,lee_eisenberg,food for thought (and even more),9,16 November 2009,"Parallel stories have always made for something neat in movies - especially when they're true stories - and Nora Ephron's ""Julie & Julia"" is a really good one. Half of the movie focuses on Julie Powell (Amy Adams) an unfulfilled government employee in a New York where the memory of the 9/11 attacks is still fresh in people's minds. So, she sets out to prepare every recipe in Julia Child's cookbook, all the while blogging about it. Meanwhile, we see Julia Child (Meryl Streep, masterfully chewing the scenery) during her years in Paris learning how to become the chef that everyone knows.At the very least, this film should make you want to prepare at least one fancy meal. But beyond that, it's a fun look at life. The movie makes clear that both women wanted to do something more than the lives that they led, and they both made the most of themselves. It's a truly fine piece of work, and hopefully will garner both actresses Academy Award nominations.Let's start cooking! Also starring Stanley Tucci, Chris Messina, Linda Emond, Jane Lynch, Mary Lynn Rajskub, Vanessa Ferlito, Casey Wilson and the voice of Mary Kay Place.",Julie & Julia
8,jboothmillard,Julie & Julia,7,19 April 2011,"From writer/director Nora Ephron (Sleepless in Seattle, Michael, You've Got Mail), this was the film that saw the star of Kramer vs. Kramer and Sophie's Choice (the two she won for) get her record sixteenth Oscar nomination, and I was certainly looking forward to seeing why. Based on two true stories, this sees both the lives of cook Julia Child (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Meryl Streep) who lives in Paris during the 40's and 50's, and Julie Powell (Amy Adams) in Manhattan in 2002 following her recipes. Julie has a boring job working as a call centre worker answering calls from victims of the Spetember 11th attacks and people who don't like the idea of rebuilding the World Trade Center. To bring some sort of purpose and escape into her life she decides to start a blog where she has a whole year, 365 days, to follow all 524 in the cook book by Julia Child, Mastering the Art of French Cooking (1961). In amongst this we see how Julia Child herself learn French and a other forms of cooking that lead her to create these recipes and write the book. We also see the personal life of Julia living in Paris in the 1950's, thinking of a way to reach out to other housewives with cooking, and being with loving husband Paul (Stanley Tucci). Both plots intertwine to show similarities in both women's lives, their relationship with cooking, and how it influences and in many ways improves their lives. Julie has her snags with the recipes and the schedule she has set, and there is a point when her husband Eric (Chris Messina) confronts her about spending more time on the blogs and cooking than anything else, but they kiss and make up. Julie is pleased to find out that her blog becomes the fourth most popular on the internet, but she is even more surprised to be contacted by loads of literary agents and journalists who want to publish her work, until she eventually accepts an article in The New York Times. Towards the end Julie does finish all recipes before her deadline, it is revealed that Child herself is not happy with the blog, but in the end after visiting Child's kitchen at the Smithsonian Institution, Julie still sees her as an inspiration, and the same kitchen in the past sees Julia having her book published. Also starring Jane Lynch as Dorothy McWilliams, Vanessa Ferlito as Cassie, Mary Lynn Rajskub as Sarah, Helen Carey as Louisette Bertholle, Casey Wilson as Regina and Linda Emond as Simone Beck. Streep gives an appealing eccentric performance with some gusto, Adams is possibly a little under-looked in her fantastic performance, and Tucci gets his moments as Child's husband. The story merging the past and more recent true stories together is very clever, the preparation and presentation of the foods and meals are just as exciting to watch as the events play out, there are moments that will make you laugh, and it just enjoyably refreshing, a most worthwhile biographical drama. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. Very good!",Julie & Julia
9,rmax304823,The Art of Blog Writing.,5,11 April 2010,"Many people seem to have enjoyed this movie, especially the part about Julia Child, but I couldn't get with it. No resonance. Not even my interest in cooking helped. Maybe it was a case of too high a blood level of congeners or something, I don't know.It's the story of two women, Julia Child and Julie Powell, who discover a meaning in life through cooking. Everybody knows about Julia (Streep). She settled in post-war France with her diplomat husband (Tucci), became bored, and enrolled in the Cordon Bleu to ""master the art of French cooking."" She became an icon on live television, unafraid to pick up a chicken she'd dropped on the floor, rinse it off, and throw it back on the table with a philosophical shrug. This narrative thread has gotten a lot of applause but I found it interesting mainly because Streep gave such a good impression of Julia Child.Amy Adams plays Julie Powell, Amherst graduate with a major in creative writing, with a terrible office job, an apartment in Queens (the borough that used to be Archy Bunker land), and an obsession to find an obsession. The obsession turned out to be a wildly popular blog in which she describes how she worked her way through more than 500 recipes in Julia Child's book in one year.I was grateful for the loving, supportive husbands provided by Tucci and Messina. True, Messina gets fed up and storms out for a while, but we are spared the bathos of arguments about the meaning of life and love, of spats over whether the wives love cooking more than their marriages. Powell evidently had an affair or two during her husband's absence but it isn't mentioned in the movie. As it stands, the marriages seem a little less abrasive than most -- certainly less than mine was -- but ultimately satisfying to the partners.There was a bit of a problem swallowing Julie Powell's memoir. First, if you're so ill paid, how do you afford the fancy ingredients in Julia Child's cookbook? Well, okay, you can skimp in other areas. Cancel the reservations at Masa. But, all seriousness aside, how can anyone, even a cartoon Superhero, drag her behind home from a depressing job in a cubicle and tackle one of Child's recipes -- every night, starting from scratch? At what time does the dinner bell ring -- three in the morning? And when do you squeeze in the time to make the entry in your blog about the difficulty you had murdering the lobsters? I'm not sure I BELIEVE all of Julie Powell's story.That's a problem with many memoirs. Anyone can claim anything they like, especially in a blog, and if the fabrications are artfully designed and presented, who's to say otherwise? I wish Powell's husband had kept a blog too. I wish I'd been able to. Did you know that when I was five years old I played ten games of chess simultaneously while blindfolded? (See what I mean?) As far as the film itself goes, it's okay, without being more than that. Streep's impression of Child is impressive. Amy Adams is cute and amusing. Nora Ephron's direction is competent. I've always liked Stanley Tucci. He has a face made for the camera, including the receding hairline, and a good range as an actor. Here he looks a little like Ben Kingsley doing Gandhi.There's something else missing from the movie, though, now that I think of it. It didn't make me hungry. I don't think anyone could watch ""Tampopo"" without salivating over the Japanese dishes. But this film brushes the cooking aside as merely a tool for self expression. The whole story is given birth by Julia Child's cookbook, rather than by food per se. But admittedly, outside of a dog, a book is a man's best friend. Inside a dog it's too dark to read.",Julie & Julia
10,moonspinner55,"Maddeningly cutesy-poo...although, granted, one of Ephron's better efforts",6,3 February 2011,"Leave it to writer-director-producer Nora Ephron to turn Julia Child's mid-life genesis from restless housewife to culinary guardian angel into a romantic comedy--complete with couples under the covers and kisses all around. It's another one of her 'heartwarming' fairy tales, juxtaposing Child's gourmet awakening in Paris, France circa 1949 with that of a modern-day government employee who finds her voice in blogging about cooking. As frustrated Julie, Amy Adams gets the kind of role that Diane Keaton and Meg Ryan have thankfully graduated from; she flops at emulating one of Julia Child's dishes and comically collapses on her kitchen floor...didn't Roseanne Barr rescue us from this kind of thing? It would all be too much if not for Meryl Streep's brilliant interpretation of Julia (and Stanley Tucci is wonderful, too, as her adorable, adoring husband--the rock for whom Julia leans on). Ephron, working from Julie Powell's memoir and also Julia Child's book ""My Life in France"" with Alex Prud'homme, can't resist turning this fluffy double-date into a valentine for the middle-class married set. Her goal is not in researching Child's extraordinary mark on the culinary world, but in sending men and women out of the theater, arm in arm, sniffling. **1/2 from ****",Julie & Julia
11,blanche-2,Fun film about food and love,8,23 January 2010,"Amy Adams and Meryl Streep are ""Julie and Julia"" in this 2009 film that juxtaposes the lives of Julie Powell, a young New Yorker working for a post-9/11 organization, and the famous chef Julia Child when she was just starting out in the 1940s. Julie is unhappy in her job; Julia, in France with her husband (Stanley Tucci), wants something to do. Julie, who wants to be a writer and loves cooking, decides to cook her way through the Julia Child cookbook and blog about it; Julia takes class at the Cordon Bleu, where she's the only woman.The story moves smoothly back and forth from the 2003 Julie and the 1940s Julia. I frankly was more interested in the Julia Child story than the Julie one, although Amy Adams is very good as Julie. Streep gives a larger than life performance, and the film shows Julia as having a wonderful marriage that is unhappily childless. She and Tucci are wonderful together.The Julie story is a little more problematic. Apparently the character had to be softened somewhat from the original book, and this may be where some story problems came in. The marriage of Julie and her husband Eric (Chris Messina) is much more volatile than the Julia-Paul relationship; he comes off as a jerk at times. I wonder if that was true, or if it comes off that way because of playing down the more aggressive aspects of Julie's personality.For whatever reason, the two stories aren't evenly balanced, Julia and Paul being far more likable and interesting. For one thing, we get a glimpse of Child's family in a great scene with her sister (Jane Lynch) and also her cookbook collaborators. As someone who has collaborated with authors myself, I got a real quick out of that part of the story.""Julie and Julia"" is lots of fun, and the food is fabulous. New Yorkers will be able to identify with Julie's and Eric's living situation, as well as her job, and viewers will be fascinated by how Julia Child became - well, Julia Child.",Julie & Julia
12,Quinoa1984,sweet and fluffy and with real (more-or-less sympathetic) characters,7,10 August 2009,"Nora Ephron isn't a director I rank among the great-visionary-of-all-time directors, but when she can get a project that's fitted for her better sensibilities- of characters seeking things in life for themselves that may or may not involve romance or lack-thereof- she hits a pretty good stride. She gives us characters that are audience-friendly but not just cardboard cut-outs; even her film You've Got Mail, which is the proverbial 'decent Sunday afternoon kinda-chick-flick' has some really good moments. Julie & Julia is a movie that provides both men and women, young and old, with something we can all get around: food. And a little bit of the relationship-stuff with two married couples.It's a juxtaposition that more or less works; it's about Julia Child's decade-long quest to become a cook, or rather more crucially to publish a book she co-authored that ended up changing the world of cooking for Americans (basically THE translation of French-secrets for Americans, not to mention with her subsequent TV show), and Julie, a struggling and unlikely bureaucrat who decides to start a blog where she'll write about going through Child's book in a year. Both of the women struggle, both but their husbands through their share of headaches, both end up triumphant in their own respective fields, one as a creator and one as a, well, blogger who is, ironically, dissed by the 90 year old Child who may not have even read the blog (this is from real life, not just made up for the movie, though it's hard to say whether Julie kept following the Julia ""in her head"" as it were in the movie).While Amy Adams, who plays Julie as a neurotic person who really wants to be a novelist but ends up with this self-imposed challenge to get her through (as with AA she says) one day at a time, and does a decent job if not any more memorable than her turn in Doubt, Meryl Streep ends up stealing not only scenes away from Amy Adams but from the other actors around her, with one exception (Jane Lynch playing Child's also bigger-than-life sister). The scenes with Streep are just pure joy, even when things look really down with her husband, a US government employee working in Paris, is called back to Washington on suspicion of espionage - this part of the plot is handled delicately, just as with a certain personal note made about Child's lack of her own family- or when things look down with the rejections of her book. It's such a towering performance that is just as BIG and complex but hateful as Daniel Day-Lewis as Daniel Plainview.Ultimately, the movie is about doing what makes you happy, and we're happy seeing these characters try and work through that, in the ups and downs, the little things in life that add up, the burned Beef stew or the move away from Paris, the days where things go wrong but need to turn around . Ephron gets how to make this deeper than just a fluffy movie with women and their husbands and lots and lots and LOTS of awesome-looking food (even on a box of popcorn it makes one's mouth drool), but the good thing is it can be enjoyed just as that as well, with moments of real hilarity and earned catharsis. It was much better than I expected, to put it another way. 7.5/10",Julie & Julia

Her voice has the quality of Eleanor Roosevelt combined with that of a Bronx yenta. Her life is shown as Julia Child, the cooking expert whose life took off as the wife of a diplomat in France after World War 11.Amy Adams is equally good as an American whose life seems to parallel her idol Julia's.You really seem to care more about the women than what they're trying to cook up in the kitchen.

15,sunwarrior13,A Pleasant Film,9,17 October 2012,"Julie & Julia is a comedy-drama that features Meryl Streep and Amy Adams together with Stanley Tucci,Chris Messina,Linda Emond and Jane Lynch. The film contrasts the life of chef Julia Child in the early years of her culinary career with the life of young New Yorker Julie Powell, who aspires to cook all 524 recipes in Child's cookbook in 365 days, a challenge she described on her popular blog that would make her a published author.The movie was written and directed by Nora Ephron.Julie Powell is a young writer with an unpleasant job at the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation's call center, where she answers telephone calls from victims of the September 11 attacks and members of the general public complaining about the LMDC's controversial plans for rebuilding the World Trade Center. To do something she enjoys, she decides to cook every recipe in Mastering the Art of French Cooking by Julia Child in one year; Powell decides to write a blog to motivate herself and document her progress.Woven into the story of Powell's time in Queens in the early 2000's is the story of Child's time in Paris throughout the 1950's, where she attends Le Cordon Bleu to learn French cooking and begins collaborating on a book about French cooking for American housewives. The plot highlights similarities in the women's challenges. Both women receive much support from their husbands, except when Powell's husband becomes fed up with her excessive devotion to her hobby and leaves her for a short time.Eventually, Powell's blog is featured in a story published in The New York Times, after which her project begins to receive the attention of journalists, literary agents, publishers, and a dismissive response from Child herself. Although Child's book is rejected by Houghton Mifflin, it is accepted and published by Alfred A. Knopf. The last scene shows Powell and her husband visiting Child's kitchen at the Smithsonian Institution and Child in the same kitchen receiving a first print of her cookbook and celebrating the event with her husband.Julie & Julia is one of the gentlest, most charming American movies of the past decade. It has great performances especially Meryl Streep,who does an amazing job bringing television cooking legend Julia Child to life and making us smile every frame of the way.Boosted by her charismatic performance,the movie is a light, but fairly entertaining culinary comedy.Also,Amy Adams does a wonderful job as providing her natural comic timing and sweetness to make Julie Powell as human as possible.Considering it acknowledges it's perfectly healthy for women to enjoy both eating and sex, it qualifies as something rare in Hollywood which is a feminist work of popular art.Although it is a misguided film of differing expectations saved only by its performances,it still manages to be a pleasant film.",Julie & Julia
16,jotix100,The joy of French cooking,8,16 October 2010,"The legendary figure of Julia Child, an icon who pioneered techniques she had learned during her years of living in France, was an idol for Julie Powell. The young woman, arriving in New York from the South, goes to work in one of the most depressive jobs anyone could manage: she was one of the people answering the telephones dedicated to help the families that had lost loved ones in the attacks to the World Trade Center in 2001.Living in cramped accommodations on top of a pizzeria in Long Island City, Queens, she decided, as a way to deal with the stress of her job, learn to cook all the recipes in Julia Child's classic book on French cuisine. With the encouragement of her husband, Julie began a blog in which she described her progress in following the over 500 entries in the book. Some were easier to follow than others, but she stayed until the end.At the same time, in a parallel story, we are taken to France to relive the real Julia Child's experience in her adopted country. Her husband, Paul, had worked for the government, as a sort of a cultural attache. Paul Child had lived in Europe for quite some time and worked as a teacher. It was in Asia where he met his wife, the former Julia McWilliams. After WWII Paul was posted to France, thus beginning a love affair with that country that was shared by Julia.Julia, an intrepid and fearless woman, decided to enroll in a cooking course at the prestigious Cordon Bleu, something that did not start well. Her meeting with Simone Beck and Luisette Berthole proved providential because she was able to develop as a cook with the help of ""Simca"" Beck. Their partnership resulted in writing a monumental book that was turned down by an important editorial until Alfred Knopf picked it up, making it the most important source for American cooks to appreciate the nuances of the French ways of cooking. The television program that followed gave the audiences a taste of Ms. Child as a no nonsense woman not afraid to make fun of the way she prepared those intricate recipes on the air.""Julie and Julia"", directed by Nora Ephron is a fun comedy for all to enjoy. The real Julie Powell's book and blog, as well as Julia Child and Alex Prudhomme's ""My Life in France"" served as the model for the screenplay written by Ms. Ephron. The film is delightful and light as a French soufflé.Meryl Streep appears to have had a lot of fun with her Julia Child. She captures the essence of the lady without making it a caricature. After all, something that with another actress could have easily have been the case. Ms. Streep is wonderful to watch. Equally enjoyable is Amy Adams, who is developing into a welcome presence in all the films she appears. The men in the lives of the two women are played by Stanley Tucci, who plays Paul Child and Chris Messina, as Eric Powell.Hopefully, the viewer will watch this film with a full stomach because watching the preparations of such excellent food without any nourishment can send the viewer into an eating binge.",Julie & Julia
17,writers_reign,Plain Nuts,8,19 September 2009,"Norah Ephron is nothing if not courageous. I say this because she allowed her name to remain on the credits of Mixed Nuts, a film that made Raise The Titanic look like Citizen Kane. Indeed food seems to figure prominently in her oeuvre at least in terms of titles - Candy, Mixed Nuts - but now she gives us the real thing and returns to form with this more or less factual story of two housewife-cooks, both of whom wrote about cooking and became celebrities. You need to be good to go up against Meryl Streep and Amy Adams IS good but perhaps not yet in Streep's class. Interestingly - and arguably wisely - Ephron never allows them to share a scene; this is true to the facts but as we know better writers than Ephron have 'allowed' real historical personages to share at least one scene in the interests of drama - think Elizabeth the Ist and Mary Queen Of Scots.

I want all three characters to be played by the three actors who play them in this film -- Meryl Streep, Stanley Tucci and Jane Lynch -- and I don't want one single shot of the film to show me anything other than these three and their exceptional screen chemistry.This lopsided movie spends far too much time on the contemporary story of Julie Powell, a whiny failed writer, and her attempts to cook her way through Julia Child's formidable cook book. Amy Adams, who has given lovely performances in other things, perhaps plays Julie too well, because I wanted to strangle her. She seems to think she learns something about herself through her self-imposed challenge, and obviously owes a tremendous debt of gratitude to Child (who she never meets), but what she learns I couldn't ever figure out. Her husband, played by the vaguely unlikable Chris Messina, is depicted as the Most Loving Husband on Earth, but still somehow manages to come across as a cocky jerk. Not one scene that Adams and Messina have together feels authentic -- too bad, since this movie spends about 80% of its time with them.The other 20%, you ask? Sigh.... It's spent with the splendid Ms. Streep and Mr. Tucci mentioned above, and the brilliance of their performances only serves to bring awareness to the weak movie surrounding them.Grade: B",Julie & Julia
21,ferguson-6,What's for Dinner?,6,12 August 2009,"Greetings again from the darkness. Meryl Streep is amazing. I can't imagine how many times I have said or written that over the years. In a short period of time, we have watched her as the cold, manipulative nun in ""Doubt""; the free-wheeling, singing mother of the bride in ""Mamma Mia""; and now as TV and cooking icon Julie Child. She always delivers more than can be expected.That is an odd way to begin the comments on this film, but Ms. Streep is so far and away the best thing about the film, that it only seemed appropriate. She captures not just the spirit for life that Julia Child carried, but also the ambition and focus to create something for many to enjoy. Many are laughing this off as an fun loving impersonation of Ms. Child, but there is much more depth to the performance than that. She brings the pride of accomplishment to the role.I experienced a very odd sensation while watching the film. During the Julia portion, I was glued to the screen and focused on every nuance. When the ""switch"" would occur, I could feel the droop in my body - literally like a balloon that was losing air and then got a shot of helium for the good segments! I just found the Julie Powell chapters to be lame and a drag on the film. If not for the lovable Amy Adams, I would have thoroughly disliked Ms. Powell and her selfish antics. No wonder Ms. Child was no fan.Definitely a must see for the amazing Meryl performance. I know it's early, but another Oscar nomination seems a must for this treasure of film.",Julie & Julia

Meryl Streep plays Julia Child who learns to cook and eventually has a cook book published which will inspire young Julie Powell decades later to write a blog, which consists of serving up every meal in Julia's cook book. Directed by Nora Ephron with breathtaking art direction that captures both time frames. Ephron previously made such films as Michael as well as the underrated Bewitched. Streep is hilarious as progressive Julia who loves to cook but also has a knack for sarcasm. Amy Adams plays the struggling yet determined Julie who accepts the task at hand inspired by Julia. What is unfortunate is the conclusion where we are given the reality that not only did the two principal characters never meet, but apparently Julia wasn't pleased with the attention given by Julie. This is disheartening and not entirely in place with the personality Julia gives off throughout the film. Stanley Tucci plays Julia's loving husband who works hard but remains loyal. Only Chris Messina as Julie's husband seems flat only popping up when convenient for the plot.

23,HotToastyRag,The entire movie could have been about Julia Child,7,30 April 2020,"Julie & Julia is the poster child for why I don't like stories that transport back and forth between the modern era and the past. With so few exceptions I could count them on my right hand, every movie or book that employs this dual narrative genre falls into the same pattern with the same flaw: the modern timeline is infinitely less interesting. I always find myself wishing the modern half was cut out completely so I could focus on the glory of the story about the past.In this pseudo-comedy, a floundering, untalented, unlikable young woman, Amy Adams, decides to create a blog about her failed culinary exploits. She doesn't know how to boil water, and she decides to go page by page through Julia Child's cookbook, Mastering the Art of French Cooking. Interspersed in her ridiculous, uninteresting ""adventures"" are snippets of Julia Child's life.
While it's great fun to see the splendid Meryl Streep reincarnating Julia Child in the kitchen, exploring culinary school, and furthering her career, I loved the human aspect of her story. The entire movie could have been devoted to her life, career, and marriage, without the audience feeling that anything was missing. Her life was much more than just a cookbook and a television program, and this movie shows her sorrows. Mr. Child is portrayed by Stanley Tucci, and he has such wonderful chemistry with his onscreen wife, you'll find yourself wondering if he's the same actor who normally plays bad guys in his movies. They're so delightful, sweet, and loving together, and their scenes are the best in the movie. In my favorite scene, Meryl and Stanley are enjoying a lunch date in a restaurant. They're discussing what she should do for a career, and Meryl, mid-bite, says she loves to eat. Stanley says, ""You're so good at it!"" and she chuckles as she says, ""I am! I'm growing in front of you!"" By the end of the scene, they decide she should go to cooking school and develop her love of food.So many Hollywood biopics include a primary plot of an ""average Joe"" whose life is altered because of an interaction with the featured celebrity. I don't happen to like that pattern, because the featured celebrity is always interesting enough to warrant an entire movie about his or her life. The average Joe simply isn't necessary, and it detracts from whom every audience member has come to see. Amy Adams's performance is not to blame for the lousy parts of this movie. She did what she was supposed to do, but she just shouldn't have been asked to do it. Meryl Streep's fantastic reincarnation of Julia Child makes this movie worthwhile, but it is disappointing that she's relegated to a supporting role.",Julie & Julia

25,zetes,"Uneven and dramatically uninteresting - Streep is, however, fantastic, as you've no doubt heard",5,13 December 2009,"This didn't look like the kind of movie I would enjoy, so I avoided it in theaters. I was correct. It seems that the vast majority of people see the film as I do, finding the Julie sections of the film intolerable but liking the Julia sequences. I think, though, that my assessment of the film as a whole is a bit weaker than that of others. I loved Streep, of course, and if she's going to win her third Oscar for this one, so be it. It's as worthy of a win as her work in Doubt last year, and without the competition, it'll be easy for her (I think she'd rank as my third favorite this year so far; haven't seen Carey Mulligan in An Education yet, but I would rank Gabourey Sibide in Precious above her). Still, as enjoyable as she (and Stanley Tucci, who plays Child's husband) are to watch, the Julia sections don't really have any conflict. I think, if the film were just the Julia sections, as many people want, it wouldn't be all that much better. I think, without the contrast with Julie, Julia Child's endless joyfulness would start to annoy after a while. However, though it needs the contrast to work at all, Julie Powell comes off as a whiny little bitch. She's detestable, so that necessary contrast just ends up irking further. God bless Amy Adams, because, without her in that role, it might have been completely unwatchable. Hell, I saw Night at the Museum 2 last week, and, as eye-bleedingly awful as it was, she was just delightful. Even when playing a complete shrew like Julie Powell, I was still in love with her. This Powell woman, I mean, who the Hell cares? Who were these people even reading her blog? I can't imagine anything duller. What next, a movie about Youtube's most popular vlogger? I like how the internet has brought to light some great talent that would otherwise have been entirely ignored (it's especially wonderful for musicians), but with the good has come the dregs of humanity. Powell may not quite be the dregs of humanity, but she's done nothing to warrant what she has achieved. Add to all that the fact that the film just goes on way too long and you have yourself a pretty lousy movie, with the one great thing about it, Streep's inevitable 16th nomination, almost entirely worth missing.",Julie & Julia
26,Sylviastel,Meryl's 16th nomination!,8,9 August 2009,"I predict that Meryl Streep will earn another Academy Award nomination for her role as Julia Child in ""Julie and Julia."" She steals the movie hands down but not without an outstanding supporting cast including Stanley Tucci who plays her life partner, companion, lover, and wonderful husband, Paul Child, an American diplomat. They arrive in France in post-World War II to help with the recovery. Julia decides to take up cooking after trying hat-making etc. Paul and Julia don't have any children of their own. I wished that Nora Ephron would have made it clear why they didn't pursue having children. In the book, ""My Life in France,"" Julia explains that they could have adopted a child if they really wanted children. Julia said that she was fulfilled in studying gastronomy or culinary arts and completing a cookbook about French cooking for Americans and maybe the English speaking world. They enjoyed their life in Paris but Paul's job was only for 4 years. He was transferred south to Marseilles and later to Germany. We don't see much of those scenes in the movie. We see a lot of Paris especially through Julia's eyes and voice. Her husband had spent years there in the 1920s.Well after she finishes cooking school at the expensive Cordon Bleu, she and two other French cooks teach American wives of diplomats how to cook in French for $2.00 each lesson. Anyway the movie splits between post war France and 2002 in Queens, New York and New York City after the events of September 11, 2001. Julie Powell is a married professional woman. Julia went to Smith College and Julie went to Amherst College. Julie decides to do something different with her life because her job dealing with callers about issues relating to September 11, 2001 can break your heart. Julie likes to cook so she decides to complete Julia Child's cookbook of 524 recipes in 365 days. While Julia learns to cook and pursues getting the book published with her co-authors, Simka, played wonderfully by stage actress, Linda Emond, and Louisette, played by Helen Carey. You know what they say about too many cooks spoiling the meal. It's same with this cookbook. The two Frenchwomen write the French cookbook together and get rejected because it's not in English or American English. Julia is recruited to be the American co-author which she happily accepts. Meryl Streep's performance should earn her at least a nomination for this performance.She brings Julia to life and let's not forget Stanley Tucci has her wonderful, adoring husband. He should have written a book about how to be a good husband. They have a mature, sensual, and sexual relationship. I also can't forget the wonderful Jane Lynch playing Julia's sister. Remember, Julia was over 6 foot tall and from California. Jane Lynch is a hoot as her sister, Dorothy. Deborah Rush plays Avis, her pen-pal and friend for years before they met in person.Julie's husband played by Chris Messina does an admirable job. Amy Adams is the girl next door and does the job well as Julie Powell.",Julie & Julia
27,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Julie & Julia,7,14 October 2009,"Watching this film made me want to pick up proper cooking, in whipping up some gastronomical delights to satisfy tastebuds, and what better way to bond with friends than over a delicious meal? Of course this wasn't the ambition of Julie Powell (Amy Adams) or Julia Child (Meryl Streep), two real life characters in which this film adopted from, where their passion stemmed from, well, boredom and the desire to occupy their time with something.It may be a gimmick to think how these 2 true stories got weaved together into one film, but truth be told they're as distinct as can be, although director-screenwriter Nora Ephron managed to draw a number of parallels in events between Julie and Julia's life, from their moving of residences, to the search for their calling in order to avoid idle days and empty dreams. It's also easy to dismiss this as a chick flick, but there are a lot more going for this film, in its rather positive outlook thanks to Julia Child, and that underdog finding its big time and 15 minutes worth of fame in Julie Powell.While I could identify with Julie Powell in her need to find an outlet to get away from what you do all day (hence similar rationales for the creation of a site like this one), I thought Julia Child's story was more entertaining, especially with Meryl Streep fleshing out the delightful role with camera angles and shoes bringing out that giant of a character in her, and that undeniable, distinct accent to mimic what the real McCoy would have sounded like. Her struggles too against some impossible odds (working in a male-dominated profession, having the school mistress hate you, etc) was something you'd root for her to win, thanks to her infectious can-do, fearless attitude, something which we can all take away from.Amy Adams' star continues on its meteoric rise to fame, and while both Adams and Streep has crossed swords before in Doubt, here they share the marquee but spend all their time apart in their respective timeline, so while Adams still managed to hold her own, it's still the veteran who comes out tops given her more interesting, positive looking role versus the relatively self-centered one in Powell's characterization. Adams' role also had shades of her previous one in Sunshine Cleaning, where the protagonist felt a little embarrassed to share with her peers what she is currently up to, which led to a leap of faith in a change of career/after-work plan which probably turned out to be the best thing in her life as far as the boosting of self-esteem goes.Credit also has to be extended to the supporting characters with Stanley Tucci and Chris Messina playing the Child and Powell spouses respectively. Fans of The Devil Wears Prada would recognize the former who had played a role opposite Streep, and here they share the same screen again. The men provides that warm body for the leads to bounce off ideas, seek affirmation and encouragement, and basically form the crux of their support pillar, though for the case of the Powells, a reminder that sometimes sarcasm goes unappreciated and can be the root of problems.524 recipes in 365 days. While I know I'm not insane enough to do that, the film has indeed piqued my interest to take a peek at Julia Child's magnum opus cook book the next time I step into a book store. As for the film, it's a straightforward crowd pleaser and unabashed starring vehicle for fans of the two actresses.",Julie & Julia
28,JamesHitchcock,Even Goddesses Have Off-Days,6,27 July 2021,"Julia Child (the ""Julia"" of the title) was a sort of American equivalent of Elizabeth David. (For American readers, Elizabeth David was a sort of British equivalent of Julia Child). Child and David, contemporaries born in the early 1910s, were cookery writers who during the fifties and sixties were influential in introducing an Anglo-Saxon readership to the delights of French cuisine; Child also presented a cookery programme, ""The French Chef"" on television. The ""Julie"" of the title is Julie Powell, a young married woman from New York, who in 2002 wrote a popular blog detailing her attempt to cook, in the course of a year, all the recipes in Child's magnum opus, ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"".The film tells the intercut stories of the two women. Julia Child's enthusiasm for French cooking dated from the time she spent in Paris as the wife of an American diplomat. She attended the prestigious cookery school ""Le Cordon Bleu"", but at first was regarded as an unpromising student, possibly because she was the only woman in the class. She persevered, however, and eventually mastered the art, giving her the idea of writing a cookbook. She had two co-authors, although according to the film one of these did not pull her weight and only made a minor contribution. Julie Powell achieves her goal of cooking 524 recipes in 365 days, despite only having a small kitchen and having to hold down a stressful full-time job working as a telephone receptionist for the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation.Julie Powell 's blog was very popular and later served as the basis for a successful book, but one person she was unable to impress was Julia Child herself, still alive in 2002, who dismissed the idea of cooking all her recipes in 365 days as a meaningless publicity stunt. (She also took exception to the bad language used by Powell in her blog). According to the film, Powell appears to have been very distressed by the fact that Child did not support her endeavours.I have normally subscribed to the widely-held view that Meryl Streep is the nearest thing contemporary Hollywood has to a goddess, but even goddesses can have their off-days, and I felt that her portrayal of Child as a loud and flamboyant exhibitionist was a bit over the top. Admittedly, mine sems to be a minority view- it certainly was not the view of the Academy, which gave Streep the sixteenth Oscar nomination of her career. (Her total now stands at twenty-one). I did, however, like Stanley Tucci as Child's quiet husband Paul, if only because of the contrast between the restrained performance he gives here and the utterly manic one he gave alongside Streep in ""The Devil Wears Prada"". The film also reunited Streep with another of her co-stars; Amy Adams, who plays Julie Powell here, co-starred with her in ""Doubt"" the previous year.Powell's efforts might have made a good subject for a blog, but (in my opinion at least) they do not make a good subject for a film. Or even for half a film. Cookery is not the most cinematic of subjects; ""Babette's Feast"" may be an exception, but part of the point of that film is the contrast between the sumptuous meal which forms its centrepiece and the austere daily lives of the characters. And Babette only cooks one meal, not 524. In the parts of the film dealing with Powell, I found the scenes of her day job more interesting than those where she is actually cooking, which I suspect I was not meant to. A biography of Julia Child might seem, at least on paper, to be a better subject for a film, but even here I was left a bit disappointed. ""Julie & Julia"" is all very professionally put together, but it is one of those films I could not really see the point of. A bit of Hollywood froth on the water masquerading as something significant. 6/10.",Julie & Julia

What made the movie good as it is, is because of Meryl Streep magnificent performance playing Julia Child, she was just perfect for this role. Amy Adams who played Julie Powell did a pretty good job as well, playing the sweet and passionate girl. The plot is based on a true story about two girls in different times having the same passion for cooking. Julia Child a famous chef and it showed how this charming woman got to where she is, while the story changes back and forth showing Julie Powell's side of the story of her trying to do all of Julia's recipes in just one year.

31,sddavis63,Enjoyable Nothingness,5,24 January 2010,"I wasn't blown away by this movie, but at the same time I found it enjoyable enough. Basically, Julia Child wrote a cookbook and Julie Powell cooked her way through it. That's the story - or, more precisely, those are the stories. This really is something of a 2 for 1 experience. There's the story of Julia Child (Meryl Streep) learning how to cook and fighting to get her cookbook published, and there's the story of Julie Powell (Amy Adams) learning how to cook like Julia Childs, and writing about the experience through a blog. The movie shifts back and forth between the two stories (which are 50 years apart, of course.) The stories never really connect in any way, although they certainly complement each other - the cooking aspect is obvious, as is the attention paid to the respective marriages (Stanley Tucci plays Paul Child and Chris Messina plays Eric Powell.) There's no doubt that Meryl Streep had the most demanding part in the movie, playing a woman who is, to many, an icon. Although I haven't been exposed much to Julia Child, Streep seemed to nail the part pretty well and was quite convincing. There's some interesting material about her time in France, and the portrayal of her marriage (the amount of romance, passion - and, yes, even sex - involved in it) is surprising, given her public image and persona. Tucci was effective as her husband - an American diplomat. Adams and Messina were fine in their roles, but in all honesty although the two stories are given about equal time the one you really want to know about is the Child story. No disrespect intended, but who's Julie Powell, anyway? In any event, while both stories do inject a bit of sombreness at times (McCarthy and the Red Scare in the Child Story and the aftermath of 9/11 in the Powell story) they're both told in a mostly light-hearted vein, and it's all enjoyable enough, even if it isn't the most important subject matter you'll ever find. The movie gets a 5/10.On a final note, I have to say that I rather liked Child's suggestion of the title for her book - ""French Cooking For American Cooks."" It sounds so much more approachable than ""Mastering The Art Of French Cooking."" However, the success of the book under the latter title perhaps explains why I'm not a publisher!",Julie & Julia
32,Buddy-51,one enjoyable performance in a generally lackluster film,5,11 January 2010,"For anyone who came of age in the second half of the 20th Century, Julia Child was the ""chef de cuisine professionnel"" of home cooking. Every week, millions of housewives and wannabe culinary artists would tune into her TV show or pore over her many cookbooks in an attempt to reproduce the master's recipes. With her distinctive high-pitched shrill, her folksy sayings and trademark pearls, Child brought gourmet French cooking to the masses and turned herself into an instantly recognizable cultural icon in the process.""Julie & Julia"" is not a ""biography"" in the traditional sense of that term, but rather a melding of dual stories culled from two separate sources - ""My Life in France"" by Child and Alex Prud'homme and ""Julie and Julia: My Year of Cooking Dangerously"" by Julie Powell. The latter is a writer who, in 2002, decided to work her way through every one of the 524 recipes in Child's ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" while posting her results on a daily blog. The site soon became a sensation among internet readers who shared Powell's passion for all things cooking and Child.In blending the two books into a single work, Nora Ephron has created a tasty, if somewhat lopsided, confection. One of the inherent weaknesses in the approach is that Meryl Streep so dominates the screen with her interpretation of Child that her side of the story all but steamrolls over the more contemporary side, where Amy Adams is stuck trying to add spice to the far more bland and flavorless Powell. Time and again, just as we're becoming intrigued by Child's evolution from restless housewife - living with her ambassador husband (Stanley Tucci) in Paris - to student at LeCordon Bleu to published author, we're suddenly thrust back into the infinitely less compelling world of our modern-day blogger, who often comes across as needy, self-indulgent, creepily obsessive and whiny. Frankly, I'm amazed all her friends didn't take her off speed-dial for the duration. In addition, the husbands in the film (Tucci and Chris Messina) are completely lacking in charisma and personality.Still, Streep - despite an ever-so-slight tendency towards coyness and cutesiness - is a genuine hoot and, like a good yeast, makes even the flatter parts of her story rise to the occasion. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for Adams. In the case of ""Julie & Julia,"" the wrong J gets top billing.",Julie & Julia
33,Robert_duder,A cute and funny story that is less serious than it pretends to be,7,31 August 2009,"Anyone who knows me or reads my reviews know that I feel Meryl Streep is one of the most over rated actresses in history. However, much to my dismay she might be growing on me. Certainly Julie and Julia is in essence a Meryl Streep vehicle to show her off in her prime. The other thing this film does is really give you a feel for Julia Child. Prior to this movie I knew nothing about her other than she was a brilliant chef and had a cookbook. This film turns Julia into this lovely woman with passions and dreams and a romance and family. I believe Julia Child would have been honored to have been portrayed in this way. Julie, the would be writer, who hits fame by cooking her way through the entire Julia Child cookbook and blogging about it adds a modern day twist to the story and also adds a quirky cute strong female lead who learns to idolize Julia Child. What the film lacks in plot it gains in cute, funny humor and is sickening sweet. However, it also runs far too long, doesn't follow the customary film recipe (no pun intended) because it doesn't really have a beginning, a climax and an end. I found the story to drag a little in the middle and felt like I was waiting for something to happen. The would be climax falls flat leaving me unsatisfied, even if that was the reality of the situation.Let's talk about Meryl Streep. I think I am beginning to have to admit that the woman can put on some incredible performances. Devil Wears Prada, Doubt, and now Julie and Julia. Streep completely embodies Julia Child and gives an absolutely brilliant performance. In a cute but ho-hum film she completely shines in this role. Amy Adams adds a varying personality to that of Streep's child. Adams is as cute as she is perky and her character embodies both of those things as well. Her story is inspirational and also reflects that of Streep's Child. They are never opposite each other like they were in Doubt but they still play off of each other somehow. Both are good but Streep out performs. The supporting cast plays only a small part in the film as the movie focuses heavily on the two women. Nonetheless Stanley Tucci, as Paul Child is brilliant and Streep and him have great chemistry and an adorable romance. Chris Messina is good as Amy Adams' husband but he really doesn't get a lot of solid depth to his part. He has a very shallow character even during the more emotional scenes.Nora Ephron has had hits and misses as a writer, a director and a producer. One thing can be said for certain of her is that she loves to tell a story and isn't afraid to tell it her own way. She loves sweet, and cute and I think goes after the quirky and different in both her writing and directing. She also seems to try and bring out the very best in her talented cast. Julie and Julia is not a ""chick flick"" and its not romance but certainly has elements of both. It has physical comedy, and some great heart but somehow misses the mark on being truly extraordinary. Still worth seeing for Streep's incredible Child performance. 7/10",Julie & Julia
34,ElMaruecan82,Meals to an End...,7,8 November 2019,"Nora Ephron's ""Julie & Julia"" is designed to delight fans of cooking and pastry, it really does a wonderful job at that, I swear I had a craving for a delicious and buttery Sole Meniere when I saw that first scene.The success of Master Chef and Gordon Ramsay's show has proven that people in the 2000s were asking for qualitative food, if not by the taste, at least by looking at it, that the film is set in the aftermath of September 11 might not be a hazard. Depression makes you hungry for something good, or hungry period. Julie Powell's existence was trapped into an insurance agency cubicle where she powerlessly listened to the pleas and cries of people beaten by tough circumstances, so cooking wasn't just escapism but a way to achieve something good for herself, her friends and her husband (Chris Messina).One day, she decided to push her passion a little further, blogging for 365 days during which she made more than 500 recipes from the legendary Julia Child (the 6'2 eccentric lady who exported French cuisine to the American public). She became a renowned amateur cook, a writer and the inspiration for a little movie in 2009, that earned Meryl Streep one of her numerous Oscar-nomination for a chameleonic performance. I'll get back to Streep but I have a theory about why it took many years for the film to be made.¨Producers might have figured that the audience wouldn't be interested on a film based on cooking but the success of ""Ratatouille"" in 2007 must have had a bearing in the decision. Besides, Streep is such a versatile actress she can pass as a giant woman towering over her meek and devoted husband played by Stanley Tucci and Amy Adams has such a likable doll-face quality that there's no way we can resist to that tough cookie who decides one day to raise her voice and launch herself a challenge that would not only make her famous but complete Julia's work five decades before.""Julie & Julia"" obviously insists on the parallels between the two women, the way both women weren't taken seriously at first, the resistance they met and the support they finally received with varying degrees of enthusiasm. The two stories are pleasant to watch and enjoyable, but to a limit. It took me a few scenes to accept Streep's falsetto voice and accent and while Adams as Julie had won me first, there came a point where she gets so wrapped up in her own ego that she becomes unbearable, and so does Julia. My guess is that Ephron wanted to show two strong-willed women beating the odds and achieving their dreams, the problem is that by handling two stories in the same time, the treatment stays rather superficial and Streep is no more leading than Adams.I understand that Julia is a sort of overarching influence on Julie challenge but by switching back and forth between the two women, we come to a sort of world of artificiality with two colorful persons but the entourage is only there for the colors. I first thought the film would be a sort of whimsical enchanting story à la ""Chocolat"", allowing us to discover the secret between a woman and her passion, but the film shows the passions without digging too deep. We first see Julia being transported by the taste of French food, but the character is so diluted in her desire to achieve her book that it feels like a waste not to have dedicated one single scene to a moment where she would explain why French food means so much to her.As good as Streep is, her performance covers a range that goes from eccentric, happy, motivated, serious but that never crosses the surface, and if Julie is a bit more developed, that doesn't say much. Indeed, what we gather from her is that she's a young woman with dreams, who doesn't want to be stuck in a cubicle all her life and decides to challenge herself, the blog idea was suggested by her husband.Unfortunately, Julie only shines through her personal accomplishment, there are many beautiful close-ups on food and she's a rather impressive cook for someone living in a small apartment and with a heavy schedule... but still, why cooking? As someone for which cooking is a great passion after drawing and movie watching, I find hard to believe that her food looks so beautiful as if it was meant to look good on the camera. The film shows a lot but never tells, it's all about Julie applying Julia's advice and making French recipes. It's all about the end.But I don't know if ""Julie & Julia"" is on the same caliber than ""Ratatouille"". Disney made a film that played like a tribute to French cooking, here it's French cooking that plays like a tribute to the spirit of two strong-willed women, cooking is accessory, but offers the dressing on two parallel stories that are cute but in a way that doesn't leave you with a transcending feeling, it even sounds artificial in its portrayal of France as a postcard little country where everything about food is played damn seriously, it's as naïve about France as French persons seem to be about Americans in the film.On a last note, I'm one of these height buffs and though I know Meryl Streep could even play a Sudanese truck driver but seriously how many women over 6 feet could dream of playing a leading role, especially since Julia had a rather homely look. Of course, there's no way such a movie would've been carried by an unknown actress... oh well, at least, every meal looks extremely tasty... Streep is funny, Adams is adorable but that's that.",Julie & Julia

It's two different stories. One is of Julia Child as she learns to cook after 40 and her writing her cookbook for America.

Soon, her blog takes off and she gets a lot of followers. People send her food and magazines want to do stories.I know nothing about the real Julia Child, but apparently everyone says Meryl Streep did a spot on with the annoying voice and mannerisms.

37,secondtake,Julia Child and Meryl Streep? Impossible and perfect...,8,2 October 2009,"Julie and Julia (2009)Between the great basic story (two personal successes), the loving relationships (two of those, too), and uncompromising acting (Amy Adams and Meryl Streep), it's hard not to love this movie. It's crisp and smart. Nora Ephron's writing is funny and refreshing. And the scenes, back and forth mostly between 2002 Queens and 1950s Paris, are fabulous. Julie and Julia isn't profound in the usual way, but it has many serious moments and maybe, even, offers a deep well of inspiration. For all its lightheartedness, the final quest for each of the women to rise up, persevere, and make good on her promise and dream is more than feel good. It is good. And both Stanley Tucci (with Streep) and Chris Messina (with Adams) as supporting cast are funny and warm and utterly believable. The husband-wife relationships are not as complex or filled out as you might want in another kind of movie, but they have enough fullness to form a rich backdrop to the main themes: the two talented but struggling women and their not quite parallel ambitions. These two women are fully three dimensional.The characterization of the title women might be at the core of the movie, and come from Ephron's directing as much as her writing. The smallest moments are filled with nuances--expressions or gasps or laughs or maybe just understanding gazes. Or pauses--note how often Streep pauses before erupting with some perfect exclamation. The two characters fill their roles with far too much conviction to look away. When the movie was done, a woman next to us (in the theater) said, ""I wish it wasn't over,"" and it's true. The story was wrapped up, but these two women and their husbands were such lovely, lively company, why would you want to go out into the real, chilly world?Well, maybe to see what blogs you can start, or what you can whip up for dessert. Or just to start thinking about that smart move to make so your life clicks a little louder, turns a little faster. At least, that's what it did for me. (And what do I do? I sleep in a little, have some coffee, and write an appreciative movie review, in front of you.) Whatever your feelings about Streep in the last few years, you will be amazed at her acting here--flawless, huge, and warm from the core. Adams is almost her equal, with a more ordinary character made persuasive. A fifth character, the food, is all too fleeting, but terrific and complex in the way it is in other great food movies (Mostly Martha, Babette's Feast, and Big Night, which was directed by Tucci).And for those who have an aversion to Nora Ephron because her movies are too sweet or too bankable, don't dismiss this. It has all the human warmth of her best and most famous (Sleepless in Seattle etc.) and it has history on its side, not only in the two parallel layers (a marvelous construction) but also in the figure of Julia Child, who deserves her own movie. A got a great one.",Julie & Julia

She and her supportive husband have just moved from Brooklyn to Queens, to an apartment above a pizza palace, on a busy street, but with more floor space than their previous digs! Yet, when Julie lunches with her more successful, executive-type galpals, she ends up feeling diminished. One day, as she is cooking dinner, she announces to her mate that she could be a writer and he encourages her to start. a ""blog"". Taking it one step further, Julie launches her blog with a vow to cook her way through Julia Child's cookbook in one year. So, it begins. But, will her dream of stepping out of ""also-ran"" status be achievable? Meanwhile, in flashback, Julia Child (Meryl Streep) and her diplomat husband, Paul (Stanley Tucci) have just arrived in Paris, France, to her great joy. Not only will the couple have a breathtaking ambiance for the few years but, since Julia loves to eat, the daily, very sumptuous restaurant fare is a food fantasy come true. Yet, with Paul away at work, what should she, Julia, do to keep herself occupied? Why not enroll in cooking school? But, gaining entry to the best-of-the-best, the Cordon Bleu, is not easy for a woman in the 1950's. Nevertheless, Julia does so and also becomes interested in writing a French cuisine cookbook in English, for none exists. Will her dreams be realized, too? This is a very admirable film with terrific performances and eye-opening biographical details. Child was an amazing women and Streep brings her to life most wonderfully. But, how cleverly Ephron has brought her story to the screen, by interspersing it with the tale of another admirable woman, Julie Powell! This is a major feat, deserving great praise. Adams, too, does very fine work as Powell, while a ""toned-down"" Tucci gives a beautifully understated and touching performance as Paul. The rest of the cast is quite nice, too. As for the film's amenities, from sets to costumes to camera work, they are very fine indeed. Ephron's script and direction deserve a hearty congratulations, also, although there are a few moments when the story seems to lag. Perhaps a sharper edit would have done the trick. Nevertheless, here is a film that is far above the typical Hollywood offering, so, anyone interested in quality film making should make plans for a viewing very soon.",Julie & Julia
39,callanvass,"Absolutely delightful film, Meryl Streep&Amy Adams are wonderful.",9,26 March 2010,"Julie&Julia was a movie that didn't initially interest me mainly due to my lack of knowledge of Julia Child, but being the big Meryl Streep fan I am, I decided to see what the hype was about. I'm certainly glad I did because I loved the experience, and even looked up Julia Child's history. I loved how both stores were intertwined with each other, it was cool how it flip-flopped from Julie's story, then Julia's. Julia Child is a legend of the cooking industry. She inspired so many cooks and so many great things for cooking, really revolutionary to it actually, and to see Julie try to live up to her standards and make something of herself made for great times. Julie&Julia isn't a movie just about cooking, it's a movie on how to make your life better, and relationships in general. Julia's inheritable cheerfulness was addicting, she made people happier around her, made people want to be a better person so to speak. Amy Adams is absolutely fantastic as Julie, but this is Meryl Streep's show.Performances. Meryl Streep I have never seen give a bad performance, and here she is Oscar worthy. She deserved her Oscar nomination, and did an incredible impression of Julia Child, her voice was especially extraordinary. Amy Adams is one of the best up and coming actresses, and here she shows why. She is never fully alongside Meryl Streep, but to hold her own against such a legendary actress is quite a feat itself. She is often the key to the movie. Stanley Tucci is a remarkably underrated performer. He plays Julia's husband terrifically, and I enjoyed every minute of his performance. Chris Messina is very good as Julie's husband. He gives a restrained, yet endearing performance and his chemistry with Amy Adams was just perfect.Bottom line. Julie&Julia is one of my favorite films of 2009. It's engaging, heartwarming and even funny at times. Be prepared to be hungry after watching this one, so Bon Appetit!9/10",Julie & Julia

This creative split dual movie about two pairs of couples related by a book, entertains, creates laughter, and engenders reflective memories of Julia while introducing the audience to a new fact-based female character that has her own path to travel. This movie includes ample doses of rich, intelligent humor based on the circumstances, situation, and personality of the characters. Surprisingly, this movie also depicts more substantive depth while presenting a populist summer movie. This challenging endeavor captures the trials of working from anonymity to publication and fame as well as the trials of pursuing a wild dream in the context of a relationship. Meryl Steep deserves another Golden Globe nomination for best comedy actress. This is a fun summer time movie with heart and soul that delights. 8/10.",Julie & Julia
41,ironhorse_iv,Something is stirring in the movie kitchen. A awful receipt of a bio film.,6,11 August 2013,"Julie & Julia should be call Julia & Julia, because I just couldn't stand for the other character in the film, Julie Powell (Amy Adams). I think if the movie was just about Julie Child's (Meryl Streep) life, it would have been better. The movie felt like a stalker- wet dream. Julie & Julia is a comedy-drama film written and directed by Nora Ephron. The film contrasts the life of Chef Julia Child during her early years of her culinary career trying to finish her book 1961's 'Mastering the Art of French Cooking' with the life of young New Yorker Julie Powell, who aspires to cook all 524 recipes in Child's cookbook in 365 days and read it in a blog. While, all the scenes with Meryl Streep are enjoyable; the scenes with Julie Powell are just contempt to ruin the film. Don't get me wrong, I love Amy Adams, but this role is probably one of the worst roles she ever took. I just found her character to be so self-absorbed narcissistic. She looks like a little boy whining and complaining. Having major break downs over cooking no less. She is a young writer with an unpleasant job at the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation's call center, where she answers telephone calls from victims of the September 11 attacks and her friends happen to be unlikable rich business women. Rather than quitting and getting new friends, making her life better, she decide to ride on Julia Child's coattails to riches and fame. She invest so much of her life to working on knowing Julia Child's cookbook that she started to seem like a stalker. She started dressing like her, and acting like she know her in a personal level. She even talks about dreaming of Julie Child's talking to her in her sleep. Now, they is a small line between being a fan, and being obsessed by the woman. She clearly obsessed by her. While alive, Julia Child obviously recognized this. Julia Child had to struggle and worked many years to undertake what she did, and a year after she dies; this opportunist publishes a book about herself linking herself to Julia Child. Even the title stinks of self-importance: Julie and Julia not Julia and Julie. Just who is the famous person here who worked many, many years?! Certainly not the insecure Julie. That takes extreme nerve since Mrs. Powell has admitted not completed anything in her life. She was a bloodsucker leech of a woman. Ephron's screenplay is adapted from two books: My Life in France, Child's autobiography written with Alex Prud'homme, and a memoir by Powell call the Julie/Julia Project. The film is the first major motion picture based on a blog. I read the blog for research, and found it shallow and stupid. No wonder Julia Childs disliked the author so much. The two ideas of telling Julie's life story with a blog of cooking her receipts don't really mash well. The storyline is somewhat boring, incongruent, and haphazard. Yes, the two stories are kinda relate in a way; but it's really hard to watch the movie when it jumps from one time period in Paris to the other time period in Queens, NY. When scenes with Julia Child get interesting, it cut to Julie Powell's story, so you have to wait until Powell's is done with her scenes before going back to Child. It's so badly cut up movie that you lost interest right away. Why can't this be two movies? I love Julie Child plot line because it highlights similarities in the women's challenges at the time. What is Julie Powell's problems? She has to cook all the recipes and blog. Sorry, but Julie Child's story is more interesting and has depth. Streep is over-the-top here cartoony caricature of Child's, but it was close to it. I do like Stanley Tucci as the Child's supporting husband. Their love story really did seem very cute. This movie is not Nora Ephron's best work. The continual narrative by Amy Adam describing everything we were watching was beyond annoying. It was like watching a cooking commercial. Talking about television, the movie even have the nerves to be lazy, as they just reused an old The Saturday Night Live skit to add minutes to the film by playing the whole 5 minute skit out. At 123 minutes there are 30 minutes that could have been cut out. What was with all the hate for the Republicans? We already know that Hollywood mostly dislike conservatives but is it really smart to alienate half of your paying audience by insulting them continually throughout the film. It just comes off as childish and immature, like bullies at a playground. What type of boss would say a Republican would fire you? I can honest understand voicing your opinion against McCarthyism because I, too thought it was wrong for Senator McCarthy to black list people, but why is this topic in this type of a movie? We came to see food, not politics. I did a little research and though Paul Child was sent back to Washington for an investigation, I found nothing that stated he was the subject of the investigation. In fact, he came back to Washington and was promoted. McCarthy was mentioned several times and there were a couple of republican jabs just because the director felt like it. It wasn't needed! It took us away from the main plot about the cooking. Overall: Had this been a movie simply about Julia Child, it could have been great. Instead, more than half of the movie is given to a crazy fan. I know there really are people like this, but I don't need to pay money to watch movies of fans falling head over heels over celebs. Stop thinking of making yourself into the next Julia Child, and start making yourself the next you. I say.",Julie & Julia

Very good indeed.",Julie & Julia
43,Red-125,Meryl Streep is wonderful!,10,11 September 2009,"Julie & Julia (2009) written and directed by Nora Ephron, is an extraordinary film about an extraordinary woman. Julia Child is an iconic figure in U.S. culture. She will be remembered for decades--maybe longer--as the person who showed North American women that they could create French-style cuisine. If they followed her guidance, and if they had the will and the imagination to try something new and different, culinary success could be theirs.What we forget is that before Julia Child became Julia Child, she was simply the happy, but directionless, wife of a mid-level diplomat. When fate took her to Paris, she made the most of it, and became a Cordon Bleu cook and, eventually, the most famous cooking expert in the U.S. She didn't just drift into this career--it took courage and determination to make her mark in a male-dominated arena.Because we know that Julia Child did, indeed, become Julia Child, there's no suspense to that part of the film. Director Ephron had to add something to spice up the mix, so to speak. What she added is the (true) story of Julie Powell, a young woman who decided to cook all of the recipes in Julia Child's book within one year. Ms. Powell started a blog to communicate the results of her self-imposed challenge, and the blog became a book, and the book became this movie.The problem with the film is that the halves are unbalanced. Amy Adams, who portrays Powell, is a fine actor and perfect for the part. We can sympathize with her horror at having to boil live lobsters, and we can understand the tensions that arise in her marriage because of her single-minded pursuit of her goal. However, Ms. Adams is an interesting young actor playing the role of an interesting young woman. That's not enough to carry one-half of a film when the other half of the film stars Meryl Streep.For Julia Child's half of the film, Meryl Streep, our finest film actor, portrays the woman who became a great and distinguished culinary artist. Streep inhabits the role--she looks like Julia Child, she talks like Julia Child, and she does it all without appearing to be really working at it. (The only other time I've seen an actor inhabit a role so fully was Helen Mirren portraying Queen Elizabeth II. Of course, Mirren, like Streep, is an extraordinary actor.)Julia Child was extremely tall for a woman, and Streep, although not short, most be five to seven inches shorter than the woman she portrays. Nonetheless, by skillful casting and cinema technique on Ephron's part, and by wonderful acting on Streep's part, we get the illusion that Child is towering over the people around her.Streep's acting in this film is a tour de force. As an actor, Streep can walk on water, live on air, and turn base metals into gold. She is amazing. This is a film not to be missed if only to see Streep doing what she does better than anyone else--slip out of being Meryl Streep, and become the person she portrays.",Julie & Julia
44,howard.schumann,About the simple joys of being alive,9,17 December 2009,"Nora Ephron's Julie & Julia is a film about the empowerment of women who grow in strength not in spite of their husbands but because of their loving support, a rare break from Hollywood's obsession with dysfunctional families. Meryl Streep, an icon in her own right, portrays the celebrated author and TV personality Julia Childs whose book ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" was one of the most influential books of the last century. To say that Streep brings verve to the role is a vast understatement.She is Julia with her bubbly, over-the-top magnetism that makes everyone in contact with her feel energized. Based on Julia Child's memoir, ""My Life in France"", the film follows Julia's growth in Paris in the 1950s as she moves from being simply the wife of U.S. Embassy cultural attaché Paul Child (Stanley Tucci), to the development of her lifelong passion - an interest in cooking and writing. Julia enrolls in the Cordon Bleu cooking school where she is faced with an unpleasant owner, Madame Bressart (Joan Juliet Buck) and competition with professional men. Soon, she is slicing onions with the best of them. From there, the process leads her to meeting with Simone Beck (Linda Emond) and the development of a project to teach Americans how to cook with a French accent. The rest, as they say, is history.A parallel thread in the film is the story of Julie Powell (Amy Adams), a young woman who lives in a small apartment with her husband Eric (Chris Messina) in Queens above a Pizza shop and who struggles with her day job, working for the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation fielding phone calls from residents disturbed over issues related to 9/11. To reinvigorate a life that had become stagnant she embarks on a year-long project to prepare all 524 of Julia's recipes. Soon she will be recording her experiences murdering lobsters in a blog that will eventually turn into a best-selling book ""Julie & Julia,"" Though not the dominant presence of Streep, Adams creates a character that engages our interest and whose progress we follow closely. Though Julie and Julia never meet, they are inextricably linked by their love of food and the similarity of the circumstances of their lives, writers who are seeking a deeper connection to life, something that makes them feel truly alive. Supported by loving husbands, the only conflict in the film is an argument between Julie and her husband about her growing obsession to the detriment of other marital endeavors.However, this does not last long, given the supportive nature of their relationship and Julie is able to maintain her enthusiasm thanks to her love of cooking and the inspiration of the Julia Child in her head. Julie & Julia is, as one viewer put it, ""a celebration of life, culture, people, food and the wonder of an incredible love relationship between two people"", a rare effort from a mainstream media that is obsessed with the culture of conflict and the false duality of good versus evil. Julie & Julia is about the simple joys of being alive and expressing it with passion, a recipe worth devoting 365 days a year to trying.",Julie & Julia

46,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Two stories of cooking-inspired passion blend smoothly,8,30 January 2010,"""Julie & Julia"" is not about food so much as it is about setting goals and creating opportunities for personal achievement. In this way, famous television chef Julia Child (Meryl Streep) and foodie blogger Julie Powell (Amy Adams) have more in common than a passion for cooking. Acclaimed romantic comedy filmmaker Nora Ephron juxtaposes both womens' stories to illustrate this in her film and though it's a conclusion that doesn't require two long hours to cook, the life-like ups and downs and feel good moments of ""Julie & Julia"" make it an affecting and personable film.Thriving on the performances of Adams and even more so Streep, Ephron's vision to interweave two equally interesting story lines works despite the extra minutes consequently tacked on. Objectively, this is Julie Powell's story as without her the story of Julia Child is irrelevant in this film, but Child is a compelling figure and Streep playing her makes it even more so. Powell is a recently married woman with a desk job who gets the idea to start a blog about cooking, specifically trying to cook more than 500 of Julia Child's recipes from her famous book ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking,"" all in just one year. Ephron then takes pieces from Child's ""My Life in France"" and tells the story of how she came to be a cooking expert and publish what eventually became her French cooking tome. Ephron tames these equally magnetic stories, splicing them at great commercial break cliffhanger moments to keep our attention.I personally found the Julie story a bit more dynamic and interesting. There's some bias there as I'm also a blogger trying to establish myself as a writer, but I think anyone who feels or has ever felt bogged down by a job that they're not passionate about who needs to own something and find something to succeed at whether as a hobby or something more will find interest and certainly some comfort in Powell's story.On the other side of the coin is Streep's performance and Julia's relationship with her husband, Paul (Stanley Tucci). It's certainly not your average on-screen romance, but ""Julie & Julia"" is all the better for it. Finally a film where love does not factor in as much with the plot. Both these women were inspired or supported by their husbands and their relationships were an integral part of their success in this way. Streep and Tucci have a playful and adorable chemistry. They have fun together -- they're partners -- and that's all too often lost in cinematic romance.Streep as Julia, however, is the focal point of that whole side to the story. It's very much Streep being Julia more so than Julia. You notice that same sense of humor we've seen more recently from her in films such as ""Mamma Mia!"" but she takes it to Julia's level. It feels very natural yet it's also a complex portrayal. You can feel her fear and her fearlessness alike in Streep's performance and the way she responds to life in general including its challenges.""Julie & Julia"" is foremost a story of how when passion and dedication meet, wonderful things happen because no adversity lasts for long in the face of that combination. These women found their passion in cooking and stayed dedicated because of their personal relationships and both found lasting fulfillment from it.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",Julie & Julia

One in particular in America is Julie Powell(Amy Adams sporting a shorter dark wig in this film)who is starstruck by Julia's cooking skills,so Julie decides to do every recipe that Julia did and starts doing the 363 day challenge as well as writing a blog about what she did and how she coped with it. But will Julie and Julia ever meet? Before you watch this I would like to inform you that there is two stories to this. One focuses on Meryl Streep being Julia living in France,meeting her sister(played by Jane Lynch)and doing culinary skills in France,and trying to make her book be a worldwide phenomenon,while the other story is on Julie Powell who like I said is starstruck by Julia. Bottom line I enjoyed this film as I haven't seen it in a long time. The acting was great,Meryl Streep reminds me of Mrs Bucket for some strange reason from Keeping Up Appearances,while Amy Adams was great as the other person she played in the film. As for the rest of the cast there all good too. Also I like to give a shout out to the director Nora Ephron who was responsible for Sleepless In Seattle and You've Got Mail both starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan(surprised she wasn't in this movie as one of them as Ephron said she would case Ryan in every movie she would make according to the You've Got Mail DVD).

50,Turfseer,"A tale of two gourmands, or gluttons depending on your perspective",6,1 March 2010,"For those who haven't seen 'Julie and Julia', it's a tale of two gourmands, or gluttons depending on your perspective. There seems little doubt that 'Julie' is the weaker of the two stories as she is much lesser known compared to Julia Child, a seminal figure in the world of cookery. Julie's claim to fame was that she came up with the idea of preparing every meal featured in Julia Child's cookbook within a year's time and blogging about it over the internet. Some people describe her as a 'whiner' and certainly the use of various expletives in her blogs turned off a fair number of people (including Julia Child herself along with her original editor). Nonetheless, she did accrue a rather large following over the internet due to her witty style of writing. It's probably safe to say that Julie is more an innovator in the field of writing than cooking. Amy Adams does a fair enough job conveying the exuberance of the talented writer who is also a tad bit neurotic in her bid for public acceptance.The 'Julia' side of the story is far more fascinating. First of all, the recreation of Paris in 1949 is vastly more visually arresting than the blasé Queens of 2002. Then there is Julia Child's story itself, which pulls you in from the start. I like how Nora Ephron didn't sugarcoat her protagonist—she could have omitted the fact that Julia Child was an avid smoker, but chose not to! Her early training at the French cooking school, replete with the conflict with an arrogant headmistress along with the distrust of her fellow male students, reveals just how determined Julia Child was to mold a career around cooking, an avocation which she absolutely adored. The jury is still out whether Meryl Streep captured the essence of the cooking icon. Some internet posters feel that her performance was all caricature but others were convinced that Streep conveyed Julia's warmth and humanity. I personally felt there was a little bit of both as Streep aimed for a mixture of verisimilitude and parody.What keeps us interested in 'Julie and Julia' is not only the interconnected plot but our basic curiosity in seeing how both characters manage to become successful in their field. Before becoming successful, both Julie and Julia had to both deal with rejection. With Julie, her initial failure to attract an audience to her blogs, culminating in the failure of the elderly Judith Jones (Julia's editor) to show up at the dinner and interview with the accompanying Christian Science reporter, marks the low point in her quest for acceptance; similarly, Julia must also overcome obstacles including the dissonance over a writing partner's failure to make a sufficient contribution to the book the writing team has been working on as well as the initial rejection of the book by the well-known publishing house, Houghton Mifflin. And the scenes where Julie and Julia 'succeed' are probably the most satisfying of the entire movie: in Julie's case, she receives multiple messages on her answering machine; for Julia, it's the moment she opens the letter from another big publishing house, Alfred Knopf, who finally has accepted her manuscript.Both Julie and Julia both have supportive husbands who figure prominently in the story. Again, the story of Julia's husband, Paul Child (ably played by Stanley Tucci) is more interesting than the story of Julie's husband, Eric. With Julie and Eric, there's a direct conflict between the couple, culminating in a fight where they stop talking to each other for a short period of time. The conflict helps to flesh out Julie's character a bit since it is Eric who accuses her of being narcissistic (not entirely without merit). But the conflict is basically standard domestic discord type of stuff. The conflict between Paul and Julia stems from Paul's situation as an employee of the U.S. Foreign Service. There is always the fear that Paul will be transferred which might throw a wrench into Julia's career aspirations. Somehow, she is accommodating and they manage to work things out. However, there is the larger conflict of the U.S. Government versus Paul. He's called home and investigated by higher-ups who are minions of Joe McCarthy. Somehow he manages to escape being blacklisted. Some internet posters object to Nora Ephron's liberal bias, especially in her disparagement of McCarthy sympathizers. I can only laugh at the thought that there are people who actually believe that Joe McCarthy kept America 'safe from Communism'. As someone who has read numerous biographies of Joe McCarthy, I am completely convinced that Joe McCarthy only used the issue of Communism to further his career. In fact, in 1949, McCarthy supported a group of SS men accused of murdering US Soldiers during World War II. This was his first battle with the Army; in 1954, he tried to take on the Army again during the 'Army-McCarthy' hearings, and lost.Once we learn of how the two principals break through with their initial success in their respective fields, 'Julie and Julia' runs out of gas. The closing credits inform the audience of the fate of the real-life Julie and Julia. The disturbing rejection of Julie by Julia Child (as well as Julia's editor) is mentioned, but never explored. As someone who hasn't eaten meat or poultry for thirty-five years and gave up butter and cheese about ten years ago, somehow I was not impressed by the 'eat everything you can' philosophy promoted by the film's scenarists. Perhaps in Julia Child's day it was safer to eat the food she was eating since the animals were not fed the cheap grain and shot full of hormones and antibiotics as they are today. I think I'll eschew the big Julia Child gourmet recipes for more simpler fare, as I believe eating less and exercising is the key to long life.",Julie & Julia
51,Chris Knipp,Better at the first blush than the long follow-through,7,8 August 2009,"The whole trouble with the otherwise charming and very well acted new Nora Epron movie, 'Julie & Julia,' is that it's totally lopsided. There's one half that we'd love to have much more of, and another we could quite easily do without. This is several great performances, but only half of a great movie.This happens because of two gimmicks, neither of which seems particularly brilliant. Julie Powell, an ambitious and frustrated women in Queens who wanted to escape her job and become a writer, in the year 2002 devised the gimmick of preparing all the 500-some recipes of Julia Child's 'Mastering the Art of French Cooking' in 365 days and describing the process in a blog. And now Ms. Ephron has devised her own gimmick of splicing scenes from the book made from this blog together with scenes from Julie Child's book, 'My Life in France,' which takes place mostly in the late Forties and Fifties. The cookbook came out in 1961, and at the end there's a scene set then when the book comes in the mail to the Childs' house in America. Ms. Ephron takes a questionable step in choosing to toggle back and forth between highlights from the life of Julia child -- an American icon with a revolutionary effect on American sophistication about food, whose life in post-war France was glamorous and amusing -- and shots of the drab outer burough strivings of Julie Powell. Though Amy Adams, who plays Powell, is cute and appealing and even subtle, her scenes can hardly hope to compete with the ones celebrating Meryl Streep's joyous, irrepressible version of Julia Child.Chris Messina, who plays Julie Powell's husband Eric, again is appealing -- both stories concern good marriages with understanding husbands who nurtured their wives' difficult paths to fame and success -- but he can hardly compete with the likes of Staney Tucci as Paul Child, Julia's husband. Tucci and Streep are a already a team, though there could hardly be more of a contrast between their roles this time and their earlier triumph in 'The Devil Wears Prada' in which Meryl plays the ice queen fashion mag maven and Stanley plays her very gay right-hand man. Julia Child is a character full of joie de vivre, an enthusiast fazed by nothing and nobody. It must be admitted that, force of nature though Streep's Julia is, and delightful though it is to watch the scenes in which she wrestles with the mean Paris Cordon Bleu woman director Madame Brassart (played by former French Vogue editor Joan Juliet Buck), or delights in restaurant food, or gets sexy with her husband, of bones a goose or flops an omelet, the fascination of evil is such that Streep's Miranda Priestly is even more fun to watch in 'Prada.' Guilty pleasures are the best and nice characters finish last.There is a failure in Ephron's pleasing but bland writing here too. Her protagonist might have had a bracing dash of wickedness in her. There are obvious hints -- even in the end of the film itself -- that the real Julia child could have snits or be pretty darn mean, for all her ebullience. When Julie's blog gets publicized, Julia disapproves of the whole project, as if to say that the important half of this movie has no use for the other half. In her dramatization of the Forties-Fifties-Sixties Julia Child (the later periods quickly rushed through) Ephron doesn't dare show us that -- but successfully pumps up the comedy when Julia's even taller sister Dorothy (Jane Lynch) comes for a visit and quickly finds a husband.Nor does it dare show all the depths and shallows of Ms. Powell's year-long struggle with an increasingly impatient husband and a heartbreaking job with the Lower Manhattan Development. We know from the screen version that Julie burned her Buf bourguignon and lost some aspic. But out of 524 recipes in 365 days, more must have gone wrong than that.The value of this film remains the very real though partial one that Streep is wonderful to watch. So is Tucci, so reassuring, like a well-tailored suit. Streep's Julia towers (the original was 6'2""), a large, robust woman with a lusty chuckle, and she has a ""flutey"" voice that stays high but has a hearty lower note in her famous, almost threatening way of exclaiming ""Bon appétit!"" The way she sang that out at the end of her hugely successful cooking TV show, ""The French Chef"" (which Ephron and Streep also recreate) seemed silly but irresistible. The woman had such fun! She loved life. Streep's impersonation isn't meant to be an exact one, but you buy it. Her character comes to life, even if the film depicts her by playing only on a few bubbly notes.The best times in the film are the early ones, when Paul and Julia first arrive in France in November of 1948, because he's been posted to Paris in a State Department job (they met while jointly serving in the OSS in China). The film nicely captures that magic moment when they savor sole meunière swimming in butter in a restaurant in Rouen, and she tells Paul to taste it and he just says, ""I know. I know."" In retrospect, these moments, and Julia's cooking triumphs, seem frustratingly few, as the film goes on to schematically work through her struggles to put together a French cookbook for Americans in collaboration with Simone Beck (Linda Emond) and the lazy Louisette Bertholle (Helen Carey). Movies, especially the kind that constantly interrupt themselves, are better at showing us the first blush than the long follow-through. But Julia child, who was more serious and less exclamatory than Streep's appealing impersonation reveals, was not only a great enthusiast but a methodical and determined person, with the patience and the reverence for quality that any practitioner of the art of French cuisine must have.",Julie & Julia
52,BeneCumb,A good movie based on real characters... Do not watch on an empty stomach though :),7,5 August 2012,"Usually I am not fond of the movies depicting U.S. middle-class with the emphasis on female characters and their struggle in hypocrite society. But thanks to superb Meryl Streep (and to less extent, Stanley Tucci and Mary Lynn Rajskub) it is exciting and interesting to enter the world of culinary science and dainties -- I must say that this was quite new to me, I am not into cooking broadcasts or books.Two movies in one... The other couple (performed by Amy Adams and Chris Messina) is somewhat weaker, their characters are more typical modern Americans. It seems a miracle to me that Julie Powell (Adams) could achieve so much - her nature is weak and superficial.Especially recommendable to those in love with France and its cuisine... And hopefully you can afford to buy ingredients and try those delicious meals later :)",Julie & Julia
53,DarkVulcan29,Amy and Meryl,10,24 August 2009,"Two stories rolled up in one movie, proves to be quite enjoyable. The two leads, Meryl Streep and Amy Adams are very memorable. Although many critics have panned Amy Adams performance. Well I say the heck with them. Critics don't always know a good performance when they see one. Amy Adams was just as good as Meryl Streep.The story begins with Julie Powell(Amy Adams) and her husband(Chris Messina) move to Boston, where Julie works for a hot line center. But feels their is a void in her life that is left unfilled. But finds through her idol Julia Child, a famous female chef. Decides to start a blog about cooking, has she begins to cook 30 recipes. And the blog is called Julie and Julia. During that we get to see flashbacks of Julia Child(Meryl Streep) and her husband Paul(Stanley Tucci), and how she got started into cooking.An entertaining film, Adams and Streep are excellent, even though they don't have any scenes together, you feel the connection they share. Tucci and Messina are also good too. A very enjoyable lighthearted film for 2009.",Julie & Julia
54,Polaris_DiB,Cheery biographical expose,6,13 December 2009,"Meryl Streep is given all the mad props for this movie for her rendition of Julia Childs. Certainly we have something to balance out Phillip Seymour Hoffman's work as Truman Capote in Capote, since the inflection and tone is spot on in an eerily way. Amy Adams is not given quite so much credit working opposite a giant like Streep, as a lesser known published figure as well. Nevertheless, her role is spot on as the self-involved millennial attempting to give meaning to her life by blogging about working through every recipe of Childs' French cookbook. The two stories intertwine decently, and a very loving and bright movie is made as a result, courtesy of writer/director Nora Ephron.This movie is quite enjoyable and a boon to the cookbook reviewing crowd eager to see a movie to bite into (have they gotten anything special since Ratatouille, and before that, Chocolat?). It's not too bad of a movie for others, either, honestly holding characters that are fun to watch (both of the husbands are great, too) and entertaining and humorous dialog. The drama, however, is at a minimum, as we're basically left with Julie's semi-neurosis and Julia's lack of ability to have a baby to give emotional depth to two parallel stories that are essentially ""Woman gets involved with cooking; publishes."" For some reason, the more interesting bits are the details, Julie's post-9/11 world of Internet and fame contrasted to Julia's Cold War era attempt to find a place to settle. Whereas more could be made of both subplots, neither are really the point, so we're left with the cheery remainder.The only real problem this movie has is the ending, when some closing titles explain that Julie's book has been made into a movie. GREAT, we just watched it, thanks for reminding us! I think the effort was to make a joke, possibly about self-involved millenials, but really it felt like the movie just stating the obvious in an effort to make Julie's story bigger. It didn't need to be bigger, however, as everything was fine as is.It also kinda would have been nice to see Amy Adams ACTUALLY gain weight from all that French cooking. But that's nitpicking realism and isn't part of the point.--PolarisDiB",Julie & Julia
55,PWNYCNY,Ugh! Took away my appetite.,1,18 September 2009,"If you like movies about the life and times of hair stylists or nail manicurists or body masseurs or other types that create careers catering to the self-indulgent, then this movie is for you. Gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins but you would never know that from watching this inane movie. The portrayal of Julia Childs can best be described in one word - inane. Ms. Childs is portrayed as being little more than a giggling, frumpish, frivolous woman with mannerisms that are so annoying as to cause one to wonder why anyone would have wanted to spend any time with her, not to mention want to sleep with her in the same bed. If the movie had just stayed with the ""Julie"" character it may have been at least watchable, but Meryl Streep's performance is a joke. It has to be her worst performance in a movie. Her gross overacting reduces the person of Julia Childs to that of a comic caricature, and frankly there is very little that one can find amusing about Julia Child's life, especially her focus on food. Was Julia Childs really a carefree spirit as the movie suggests? Ugh! Who cares? And what is worse, part of this movie is set in France, 1949, four years after the end of World War Two and frankly who cares about post war France? If you are a fan of Julia Childs, go buy one of her cook books and cook away, but to watch a movie about her, that's another story, and not an interesting one.",Julie & Julia
56,meeza,"""Julie & Julia"" nauseates a bit until they bring the Meryl dessert",7,4 September 2009,"Warning: Do not see the following movie which this review is about while hungry, you will be overeating for weeks! ""Julie & Julia"" is not the cinematic jewel of the movie summer season, but it had enough acting taste buds to give it a marginal worthy feast. The flick is really about two Jul intertwined narrative dishes: The first entrée is the story of the legendary chef Julia Child in her days as an unknown in 1940's Paris living with husband Paul and in trying to cook up a career in cooking. The second entrée is not the not-so-tasty story of New York cubicle worker Julia Powell in 2002, who goes on a narcissist cooking rampage to stew up a plethora of Julia Child recipes and blog about it. None of the narratives were engaging enough to go for seconds, but the former had a certain Streep sauce that was delightful; which comes in the form of Meryl Streep's exquisite performance as Child. It was not a sheer imitation of Child but conducted as if it was a reincarnation of the super fem chef. It must not have been child's play in preparing for such a challenging role for Meryl, but as it is common acting knowledge, Meryl can eat up those roles alive. Acting touche also goes out to for the profoundly underrated Stanley Tucci with his understated but charming performance as Julia's husband Paul. Stanley's acting tools continue to hammer it in. Too bad he has been screwed so much by the Academy by snubbing him for Oscar noms. However, Meryl & Stanley could do much with the undercooked mundane screenplay they were fed. And my exact sentiment goes out to the Julia Powell obsessive scribe in the other narrative. Nora Ephron's screenplay or should I say screenplays were not literally appetizing and her direction of the juxtaposed stories at times made me sick to my stomach with its monotony mix. But I must admit that Nora was cooking when she inserted all the mouth-watering foods in the film, Yummy! Amy Adams was a bit over the top as Julie in displaying her narcissist persona, and it is beginning to look like Adams is being typecast as the hyper OCD nice gal. But there is something about Amy that is so enchanting, that finds it difficult to fully scorn her. Chris Messina did some nice work as Julia's patient New Yorkan hubby Eric. Messina again does some nice work in New York, oops wrong Messina; I guess I was a Yankee Doodle Pundy in that one. To end this writing pun feast, there is plenty of good food and good Meryl in ""Julie & Julia"", but not enough good for thought. *** Average",Julie & Julia
57,MaxBorg89,An uneven dish,6,11 December 2009,"It's very easy, perhaps too much so, to be skeptical regarding Julie & Julia before watching it, all because of Nora Ephron's presence in the director's chair: as deserved as he Oscar nomination for writing When Harry Met Sally was, her subsequent career has been marked by a string of predictable, not very funny rom-coms, with clumsy TV remake Bewitched constituting her creative nadir. Her new film, while certainly better than the Nicole Kidman-starring turkey, is no exception to the rule: a few laughs here and there, but no real heart.The movie, as clearly stated in the opening credits, is based on not one, but two real events: one is the period Julia Child (Meryl Streep) spent in Paris with her diplomat husband (Stanley Tucci), a time she put to good use by learning how to master ""the art of French cooking"", which later became the title of her best-selling book; the other is the blog Julie Powell (Amy Adams) started some fifty years later, chronicling her attempt to cook all the dishes listed in Julia's book over the course of a year in order to do something ""meaningful"", while her marriage started to suffer.The main problem with the film lies in Ephron's inability to make both segments equally interesting: as fine a comedic actress as Amy Adams is, her character just doesn't have that extra spark required to elicit audience sympathy, and neither does the script, which manages to make the end look contrived despite being inspired by a true story and fails to convey any means of understanding just how iconic a figure Julia Child is in America (though that might just be due to my being Scandinavian and having never heard of the woman prior to seeing the movie). It's simply another bland romantic ""dramedy"" with additional subplots about celebrity, the internet and food, all treated as if they were disposable from the get-go.The Julia section, on the other hand, manages to be more fun, although it comes with its own share of flaws: the French characters are predictably stereotyped and the ""dramatic"" storyline about Tucci being targeted by Joseph MacCarthy's anti-Communism paranoia isn't given enough room to breathe and truly have an impact. On the plus side, the decision to really shoot some scenes in Paris pays off admirably, with a ""past"" look reminiscent, of all things, of Pixar's Ratatouille, the jokes are, for the most part, spot-on, and Streep is, once again, the best reason to watch the film, her literally super-sized performance - the real Julia was considerably taller than the actress - being a delicious mix of charisma and comic timing.Long story short, Julie & Julia won't provide any reasons for most movie-goers to grant Nora Ephron the benefit of doubt: it is entertaining in places, especially when the lead actress is on screen, but lacks the necessary ingredients to really succeed as a comedy.",Julie & Julia
58,Lechuguilla,How ... Cute,6,20 June 2014,"Personally, I would have preferred a biographical film about Julia Child (Meryl Streep). She was a unique personality with a distinctive voice and style. She gave the world the gift of artful French cooking, and in the process entertained audiences with her jovial optimism. Meryl Streep gives a really fine performance here, especially with that voice and her manner of speaking. Stanley Tucci also enhances the film, as Julia's quiet, low-key, devoted husband, Paul.By contrast, the film's plot about Julie Powell (Amy Adams), an ordinary American young woman who sets about to cook all of Julia Child's first set of recipes, comes across as distracting and annoying. Julie's scenes take away screen time that could have expanded Julia's life story. Julie Powell seems to be a product of the modern age, wherein ordinary people try to become ""stars"" through the pursuit of some gimmick involving either television or the internet. Further, Julie uses Julia Child's success as a measuring stick of Julie's own sense of self-worth. As such, Julie seems to suffer from hero worship.Though the inclusion of the Julie Powell story is unfortunate, the script's plot does blend the two stories well. Scene transitions are wonderful. The film's tone is generally lighthearted. And there are some funny moments. I liked the interaction between Julia and Madame Brassart, the haughty owner of the elite cooking school; Brassart does not think much of Julia, but Julia couldn't care less. There's also the amusing scene wherein Paul comes home to find Julia next to a big pile of chopped onions.Production design and costumes are elaborate, detailed, and quite impressive. Cinematography trends generally conventional but competent. Intermittent background music is bland and nondescript. Casting and acting for the Julia Child segments are impressive, and overwhelm both casting and acting for the Julie Powell segments.The writers probably thought that a Julie - Julia combo story would be ... cute. But the two stories are not equal in importance, so the main problem with the film is thus the original story premise. ""Julie & Julia"" is not a bad film. But a focused portrayal of legendary Julia Child, sans Julie, would have been better.",Julie & Julia
59,juneebuggy,Both stories are addicting in their own way.,8,8 March 2018,"This is one of those feel good movies, subsequently I felt good watching this. Its a witty adaption of two true stories following the six decades separated lives of a then unknown Julia Child in 1950's post war France... she is the bored wife of an American diplomat (Stanley Tucci) discovering her passion for cooking... and Amy Adams as a cubicle girl and amateur chef in New York who decides to blog about her attempt to try and finish every recipe from Julia Childs cookbook over the course of a year. Both stories are addicting in their own way and cleverly edited together. Meryl Streep is amazing (as always) even if her Julie Child character did get a bit annoying and over the top, I'm assuming that's who she was though. Both women have very nice, understanding and supportive husbands but unfulfilled lives which is interesting because they are so removed from each other.Also interesting was how (through movie magic I guess) they made Meryl Streep appear like such a big woman in all her scenes, very tall.

And Amy Adams is so cute and endearing as Julie Powell, the casting works so well. Stanley Tucci also is very good as Paul Child, he provides an intriguing character and a very entertaining portrayal. I also adore the script, the writing is so well done that it keeps you invested the entire 2 hours. I was never bored with this film, no not once. And that is simply due to the quality filmmaking, well written script, and wonderful performances. The costume design and set decoration is so visually appealing too, and very historically accurate. I could never get tired of this great film, it's got everything I love in it and I strongly encourage everyone to see this film.

62,3xHCCH,Light but Appetizing Fare,6,26 January 2010,"When this movie first came out in the middle of last year, I did not really plan to watch it. I had no interest to watch a biopic about Julia Child, whom I only knew vaguely as the host of a TV cooking show with a peculiar high-pitched voice, impersonated on the Electric Company (or was that Sesame Street?) However, when awards season came, it was clear that Meryl Streep's performance in this movie is a favored one. It recently won the Golden Globe for Best Actress Comedy/Musical; and she is bound to receive her umpteenth nomination. Therefore, I wanted to check it out to see how she compared with other nominees.Turns out this film was about two people (I should have guessed given the title.) Julia Child and how she learned how to cook to the publishing of her first book; and Julie Powell, a girl who had a blog to document her attempt to cook all 524 recipes in Julie Child's book (""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"") in 365 days. The scenes alternate between these two stories, showing parallelisms and contrasts in the lives of these two women.Meryl Streep really went to town in this role as Julia Child. She captured Ms. Child's good nature and joyful love of life and cooking. She is funny and lovable here. obviously having a good time. She had good chemistry with her husband Paul (played by Stanley Tucci). It did feel like an overly exaggerated version of the famed chef. It felt like a parody in parts as much as it was a tribute in others.I am surprised that so little is mentioned about Amy Adams and her role as Julie. I also enjoyed her side of the story, particularly since we share the same passion with blogging. Ms. Adams really played Julie in a most pleasant way (as she always did in her various films) so that you rooted for her to finish her project, shared her excitement and obsession, and forgave her breakdowns. Too bad, she got overshadowed by Ms. Streep's over-the-top performance.Overall, the whole film is funny and light entertainment. Being by Nora Ephron, it is still a chick flick in its core. The scenes with the food all look very appetizing. I'm sure you will want to go find a place where they serve these things, as I did.",Julie & Julia

Somehow or other the idea of a modern-day lady with a busy job trying to do some hobby cooking did not strike me as the most moving, brave or funny material ever committed to film. So here you've got a person who likes to read cooking books, who likes to try out foreign recipes and who likes to unwind over a dusty bottle of red wine ; so how or why should this interest someone - anyone - outside her circle of friends and relatives ? And it's not as though the culinary adventures of our modern blogger reveal deep truths about, say, Mankind's eternal need for nourishment, America's relationship with food, or societal expectations with regard to a woman's role in the household. It's all very superficial stuff, of the kind you can hear by accidentally overhearing a conversation between some fellow shoppers.

64,EUyeshima,Imbalanced But Often Engaging Account of Soulmates on Parallel Tracks,6,11 December 2009,"This 2009 dramedy is an uneven case of dramatic bifurcation tied tenuously together by two characters who share a struggle to find their livelihoods through their passions. One is Julia Child, the larger-than-life culinary legend who found her calling when her adoring husband Paul, a U.S. Foreign Service envoy, is transferred to Paris in 1947. The other is her acolyte, Julie Powell, a bored call center worker for the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation in the throes of 9/11, who also happens to be a failed novelist with a supportive husband in Queens. On her first film since the execrable big-screen revamp of ""Bewitched"", director/writer Nora Ephron (""Sleepless in Seattle"") decided to meld their respective books together, Child's posthumous autobiography, ""My Life in France"" and Powell's ""Julia and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen"", into a movie depicting them as soulmates. The central problem is that Childs' story is emotionally rich and more compelling, while Powell's comparatively trivial account is the one that provides the narrative framework.In Paris, Child instantly becomes a Francophile, and forces her way into the prestigious Le Cordon Bleu to take professional-level cooking lessons where she perseveres among her disapproving male colleagues. Finding her passion there, Child partners with French epicureans Simone Beck and Louisette Bertholle to collaborate first on a cooking school for American expatriates and then on a massive cookbook currently in its 49th printing, ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" published in 1961. Her seminal TV show, ""The French Chef"" premiered in 1963, and she showcased the spirited personality that engaged home cooks for over a quarter century. Flash forward four decades to 2002, Powell, tired of her mundane job, takes her cue from Child's 524-recipe book and decides to write a personal blog documenting her attempt to cook every recipe in the book within one year. Child becomes Powell's muse, and her entertaining posts attract quite a fan base.However, her increasing self-absorption and cooking temperament start to make her marriage unravel. The two stories never really coalesce but just trail off in their separate ways. Nailing Child's braying tone and gawky manner, Meryl Streep is masterfully entertaining as usual, although there is a Looney Tunes-level edge to her mostly comic performance. She certainly evokes the memory of the real Julia, but there's also a surprising bit of parody that seems intended. Adams, Streep's co-star in last year's ""Doubt"", is an engaging presence, but Julie is basically an insufferable, narcissistic character that needs an actress with a more natural edginess. It takes a considerable effort for Adams to overcome Streep's shadow to hold up her part of the story, but the basic inequity in the story lines is never truly resolved. Stanley Tucci, who played Streep's devoted associate in ""The Devil Wears Prada"", provides a blessedly low-key presence as Paul, but Chris Messina (""Vicki Christina Barcelona"") is merely bland as Powell's non-descript husband Eric.In near-cameos, Mary Lynn Rajskub (""24"") provides needed snap in Powell's half, and once again, Jane Lynch, nearly unrecognizable in period clothing, steals scenes, this time from the formidable Streep, as Child's unapologetically high-flying sister Dorothy. The movie feels overlong at 124 minutes probably because neither story invokes that much in the way of surprise or conflict. Everything works out the way you would expect with one notable exception at the end. The 2009 DVD offers a couple of extras. One is the inevitable commentary track, which only includes Ephron explaining the details of the production, and without the participation of the cast principals, there are long periods where she says nothing. The second is a half-hour featurette, ""Special Ingredients: Creating Julie & Julia"", a better-than-average making-of piece.",Julie & Julia
65,jaybob,Uninterersting overlong adaptation of a book on the recipes of Julia Child,5,8 December 2009,"This could have been a decent semi-biography of Julia Child & her famous book on French Cooking.Julie Powell adapted her blog into a book, she should have written the screenplay. Nora Ephron both directed & wrote this very uninteresting,boring movie. I have yet to see a film by Miss Ephron that I really enjoyed & that includes 'Sleeiping in Seattle'Meryl Streep plays the over-bearing annoying Julia Child to the point where you feel nothing for the film. Stanley Tucci plays her husband, he is good, (he always is)Amy Adams IS Julie Powell & she is a marvelous character, Chris Messina is her husband.When these 2 are on screen it saves the film (in my Humble opinion) from having a much lower rating. These 2 are likable as compared to Julia & Paul, who are very annoying.The scenes with The Childs are set in the 1950's, I did not feel I was watching life in that era.Paul Childs is US embassy worker, they needlessly & without good reason tell of his problems with the HUAFC committee. Much of film made in France,did not seem very French to me. A few scenes are humorous BUT that is not enough to recommend it. There is also nothing in movie for the younger set. The food does not look that good either.Ratings; ** (out of 4)58 points (out of 100) IMDb 5 (out of 10)",Julie & Julia
66,dierregi,The growing pains of cooking French,5,28 May 2012,"Considering that Julia Child was completely unknown to me, I was curious to see if this movie was good enough to resonate with an European audience. The plot follows two parallel stories, set 50 years apart and based on real people. Julia Child – famous to US audience as expert of French cuisine and TV presenter - learning to cook in Paris in the 50's and frustrated Julie residing in Queens and holding a dissatisfactory job in NY, in the wake of the 2001 aftermath.As other reviewers pointed out, the Julia story seems a lot more interesting than Julie's and the interruptions of Julia's story are annoying. Unfortunately, the Julie character appears to be an opportunistic creature who tried – and succeeded - to exploit Julia Child's fame for a quick shot at success.The difference between Child's and the modern story are striking. Whereas it took Child almost a decade to complete her book and to get it published, with nothing more in mind than bringing French cuisine to the US (and perhaps a modest financial success), Julie is an impatient creature who is giving herself one year to become a success, mostly because she is envious of her friends.Besides, this is another example of the inexplicable American fascination with all French things. Inexplicable for me, since I live close to France and I hardly find anything fascinating or remarkable about the French, apart from their delusional grandeur. Anyway, Julie's plan is to write a blog about cooking all 500+ recipes in Julia Child book ""Mastering the art of French cooking"", secretly hoping somebody will notice it and publish a book about it, thus saving her from a future in civil service.Her plan was successful and she even got a movie about her blog, so this should be enough for Julie. On the other hand, Julia seemed a more interesting character, but also quite a difficult person to deal with. She inspired me some admiration but not warm feeling.Cute movie and great Streep's performance, but certainly no masterpiece.",Julie & Julia
67,onepotato2,Poorly prepared,3,9 April 2010,"This is a pretty awful movie because the characterization and emotional depth are sooooo shallow. Late in the story, after all the male cast members have been relegated to being neutered cheerleaders (and the female characters are scarcely better off), and the movies depth has not grown a centimeter, Amy Adams resolves the minuscule conflict it offers by copping to have been 'a bitch,' earlier in the movie. Wow... the first chickflick to suggest that women aren't rainbow-squirting delights morning noon and night, and it comes from the mouth of this total dormouse (who is actually never a bitch in the movie). It's very odd that Nora Ephron has the career and the respect that she does. She's proved herself to be capable only of the weakest sort of writing; the kind that barely disguises its structure and low aims. She's the female Akiva Goldsman. Julia Childs story deserves a decent movie of her own. Streep is just doing a rather lame impression here; but what do you expect..? Ephron hands her nothing but clichés to work with. Amy Adams has no range and always plays this grating wimp (She's identical in Doubt).",Julie & Julia
68,richard-1787,"Half a chick flick, half a good movie",6,14 August 2009,"Given that this movie was directed by Nora Ephron, who also directed such quintessential chick flicks as When Harry Met Sally, You Have Mail, and Sleepless in Seattle, several things should not have come as a surprise to me this afternoon when I saw Julie and Julia. (The order of those names should also have been a warning.) 1. I kept wondering why Meg Ryan wasn't cast as the ""cute"" female Julie. (She's beyond that sort of thing now, of course, that's why.) 2. I kept wishing the parts devoted to Julia Child wouldn't end and go back to the very predictable story of Julie Powell, which was not really very interesting. 3. I kept wondering why we had to spend so much time - definitely over 50% of the movie - on the story of Julie Powell when the Julia Child story was both so much more interesting and so much better acted.This is not a bad movie, though. The part devoted to JC is interesting, both for JC's own life and for the way it is put in the context of the politics of the time (Joe McCarthy). Meryl Streep really does a remarkable job of becoming JC, making her more than just the caricature that would have been so easy but that has been done so many times. If the DVD version lets you watch only the JC scenes while skipping the story of Julie, I would say wait for the DVD. You'll enjoy it more that way.I don't fault any of the performers in the Julie part of the movie, however. The material is just so insipidly predictable that there's not much they can do with it other than act cute, warm, and fuzzy and try not to let it drag, which they don't. While I'm not about to read Ms. Powell's book, I will hope and even assume that it and she are more interesting and less terminally cute.If guys get dragged to this on a date, they should definitely get serious compensation afterward. (In the world of this movie that would be sex, which is a frequent visitor, but a woman should be able to come up with acceptable alternatives as well if sex is not to her taste. If she could make some of the dishes prepared in this movie, that should be more than acceptable compensation.) I suspect that the Julie sections will otherwise shut out most of the male half of the movie-going public from bothering with what is not a bad movie, but not what it could have been.P.S. It occurred to me while I was taking a shower after writing the above (not that it made me feel dirty; it's just a hot, muggy day here in beautiful Akron, Ohio) that this movie really deserves an intelligent, level-headed review from an intelligent, level-headed feminist, which I am not. As I thought back on it, I realized that relationships are presented as good for the woman if her partner wants to have sex all the time. On the other hand, the women, especially the modern woman, Julie, make NO effort to take any interest in their husbands' careers, but rather devote themselves and their conversations almost entirely to their own passions. Late in the movie when reference is made to Julie's husband working for a magazine called Anthropology Monthly I realized that Julie had never asked even one question about his work, that it had never been mentioned in their conversations. We know that JC's husband works for the American embassy in Paris, but it is not until even later in the movie that we learn he is the librarian there. A good husband is presented in this movie as a man who 1) looks good with his shirt off, 2) wants to have sex with his wife often but doesn't complain when she has something better to do, and 3) doesn't expect his wife to take any time out of her own busy, important life to take any interest in his. The two marriages in the movie are presented as happy ones, but this movie presents an ideal of female-male relationships that has divorce written all over it.That, however, could be better addressed by a feminist, so I will hope one steps in to do so.",Julie & Julia
69,lewiskendell,Almost as satisfying as one of Julia's meals.,7,11 May 2010,"Julie and Julia was an interesting movie that left me knowing a lot about Julia Child and a little about French cooking. Two topics that easily make for an entertaining two hours.I thought that splitting the story into two separate but related story-lines was a great idea. Meryl Streep was as wonderful as anyone could expect, and it's not much of an exaggeration for me to say that I can't imagine anyone doing as great of a job as she did. And Amy Adams continues her run of great roles with another of the quality performances that I've come to expect to expect from her.It's been a while since I've seen this kind of movie, and I liked it enough to recommend it to anyone who's a fan of Julia, the book it's based on, cooking, or just looking to watch something that's a little different from the reams of action movies, dramas, and romantic comedies that come out every week.",Julie & Julia
70,bob-rutzel-1,"Finally, a really good story, true too",9,11 December 2009,"In the early 2000s, Julie Powell (Adams) is in a no win job and decides to cook all the recipes in Julia Child's cook book Mastering the Art of French Cooking. She decides to write a blog as she goes. Running at the same time, the earlier flashback story shows us Julia Child's (Streep) beginnings into cooking in France in the late 1940s.Have a good meal before you watch this movie because you will get hungry seeing some of the dishes prepared. This is simply delightful from beginning to end. We see Julie, a frustrated housewife get into cooking big time, blogging all the way. And, it may surprise many to know that Julia Child had her cooking beginnings in the late 1940s and she wasn't a spring chicken at the time. Both have had very supporting husbands.Julia Child wanted to do a cook book about French Cooking for Americans as one didn't exist at the time. This takes up most of the Julia Child story . I have seen some Julia Child TV shows and what you will see on the TV as Julie and husband Eric (Messina) watch is just about right. She had fun with everything she did. In the kitchen she swooned, and swooned relishing the results of just about every dish she made. Oh, let's be honest: she swooned all the time everywhere she went. Meryl Streep plays her perfectly and I would put her up for Best Actress. Streep isn't overacting. This is the way Julia Child was. And, Amy Adams plays Julie Powell perfectly. One could fall in love with her. Best Supporting Actress? Of course.In fact, the whole movie could be nominated for Best Picture. It's a joy. No shootings, explosions, shoutings or the like. It's a good story and the entire cast performed well. The pace is good and the dialogue hits all the right marks. There is a lot of humor in here and some very good lines too. Both stories compliment each other and both are true as well. Julie Powell wrote the blogs, then the book and this is the movie. See?There are some references to politics and the witch hunts by Sen Joseph McCarthy, but these are incidents that happened and the director was correct to include them. They were a part of Julia's and Paul's (Tucci) lives and not to include them would not have served any purpose. Some cable and higher UHF TV channels sometimes show the cooking shows that have Julia Child helping some other present day famous cook. Look for those shows. They are great. Make sure you eat a meal before watching as those dishes shown early on are mouth-watering. Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes, but only one F-Bomb by Tucci. Other than that some S-words.",Julie & Julia
71,intelearts,Charming and light foodie comedy,7,30 November 2009,"While never really reaching heights beyond its aim as with all of Nora Ephron this is a good little escapist movie.For those who love real food or the 1950s there is no denying that these are the strongest parts of the movie.For those who would rather Julie wasn't there I wouldn't disagree; as a purely historical piece this would have worked well, and the New York scenes seem very lightweight after Streeps and Tucci beautiful comedy of manners.However it all works together to create a lovely light comedy about food and the extraordinary force that was Julia Childs.Slightly long at over 2 hours, it has a wonderful sense of style and this is a film that women will particularly enjoy - the humor is geared for them - and the social life of Paris in the 1950s were our favorite parts.If you like food and comedy and biography, you won't be disappointed; just don't expect greatness...",Julie & Julia
72,schappe1,"""It just makes you want to grind things up""",6,14 August 2009,"My title is my family's favorite line of Julia Child's. She was grinding some meat at one point in her show ""The French Chef"" and realized that that wasn't very interesting by itself so maybe she should say something and began singing the praises of this particular brand of grinder. Finally she just smiled and said ""it just make you want to grind things up"". We all doubled over in laughter and have quoted the line ever since.The thing that made Julia's show so endearing is that she was, on the surface, hardly TV material- a large, unlovely woman with a hoarse voice, describing all these exquisite recipes and enthusing over how wonderful everything was. Yet she had a certain hokey charm, and her enthusiasm for cooking and for life was obviously very real, as was her show, which never seemed to edit out all the disasters a cook can encounter. She just steamed right through them, like a battle ship through the waves, and never lost her poise.And that's a key part of what this film is- or should be- about. The most bothersome thing in the movie is that, by telling their stories simultaneously and switching back and forth between them, the filmmakers seem to be suggesting that Julie and Julia are somehow sisters under the skin, making a similar journey half a century apart. The problem is that they aren't and it comes as quite a shock to find out that the real Julia Child didn't approve of Julie at all. The film leaves that matter unresolved and that's what I left the theater thinking about.In another age, it would have remained a mystery but now we have the internet and there is an article by Russ Parson, the LA Times journalist who made the aged Julia, who was in assisted living by that time, aware of Julie's blog.Most accounts say that Julia felt that Julie's cooking all her recipes in a year was just a stunt and that the elder lady didn't much like her coarse language. That's probably true but Parson's article gives us a significantly different spin on her reaction. Julia's intent with her book and her show was to make French cooking possible for the average American housewife. When she read Julie's printed-out blog, she was not pleased that Julie had such difficulty with some of the recipes and that she reacted so emotionally to the disasters that befall even the best of cooks. ""She's not a serious cook is she?"", Julia told Parsons.But beyond that, Julia Child, (born 1912), is part of a generation that survived two World Wars, and influenza epidemic, the depression and the Cold War, (which included Senator McCarthy investigating her beloved husband). A brief scene also indicates her heartbreak at not being able to have children. As the article points out, when Houghton-Mifflin refuses to publish Julia's book after she's worked on it for eight years, she says ""Oh, boo hoo, what shall I do now?"" Julie, on the other hand is part of a generation that revels in its own angst the way Julia reveled in her food. They write blogs to tell the world how much they hurt inside. Julie may be able to cook what Julia did but can you imagine Julia writing a blog like Julies? She was a survivor that didn't let things get her down and that came through in the determined optimism she maintained on her show, no matter what went wrong.Instead of having Julie's husband tell her that the Julia of her mind is perfect and the one in the real world isn't, what the filmmakers should have done is to show Julie learning not just cooking, but surviving while watching those old clips from ""The French Chef"". Then she would have known what the problem was, and so would the audience. Julia wasn't just a cook: she was a grinder.",Julie & Julia
73,Troy_Campbell,A delectably light-hearted film that will have you walking out of the cinema with a great big smile and a rumbling tummy,6,9 October 2009,"Meryl Streep is the Queen of Hollywood. In the first three decades of her career she had splendid performances in films like The Deer Hunter, Kramer vs Kramer, Sophie's Choice, Out of Africa, and The Bridges of Madison County that cemented her as one of the greatest female thespians of all time. This decade has been something else though. Never has someone graced the screen so effortlessly and managed to capture the audience regardless of the quality of the film. Adaptation, The Hours, The Devil Wears Prada, Rendition, Mamma Mia! and Doubt have all had varying success, but one thing remained the same: Streep was magnificent. You can go right ahead and add Julie and Julia to that list.What could have been an overdone and overwhelming caricature of a woman larger than life, Streep turns Julia Child into a lovable woman whose positive outlook on life becomes infectious. I've never seen someone like her, maybe those people don't exist anymore. However Streep only plays one half of the titular pairing and it is to Amy Adams' credit that Julie Powell is almost just as intriguing. A stark contrast can be seen immediately between her modern day pessimist and the bright light that is her idol, causing Julie's tale to seem slightly trivial at times, perhaps unfairly.Being the first motion picture based on a blog – watch out for the flood of blog-aptations to come – may have some superficial benefits, however the undercooked screenplay formed around it is evident. It is drawn out and the beginning of the third act dishes up the obligatory ""fall before the rise"" arc, which is normally integral to any underdog tale yet here feels completely unnecessary. Also, watching the trailer a few months before it was released you already knew how the beginning, middle and end would play out, subsequently putting a lot of pressure on the aesthetic aspects of the film to excel.Stephen Goldblatt's cinematography and Mark Ricker's production design are complimentary of each other and equally beautiful. Following Julia around the streets of 40's Paris is like being transported to both time and place. Their depiction of 2002 New York still feeling the effects of 9/11 (an early scene pays particular attention to this) is suitably broken and unsure, whilst Julie's rundown yet charismatic apartment is a wonderfully utilised metaphor for her life.The failings of the screenplay aside, this is a delectably light-hearted film that will have you walking out of the cinema with a great big smile and a rumbling tummy.4 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",Julie & Julia

She's fantastic.Amy Adams is a good actress no doubt about it. And she does well here too. But her character in this film , the part featuring Julie Powell, is kind of weak. It's interesting, but you want to see a lot more of Meryl. Trust me, you see a lot of Meryl.And that is a big reason as to why Julie & Julia works. Julie & Julia is based on Julie Powell's book"" Julie & Julia"". Julie Powell(played by Amy Adams)is a columnist who lives in New York with her husband(Chris Messina from Vicky Cristina Barcelona). One night, her husband convinces her to use all of Julia Child's(Meryl Streep)recipes within a year. So she blogs about this for her job. There isn't that much excitement with that. All you see is Amy Adams cooking, and arguing with her husband, and other stuff.It's the Julia part of the film that grabs you. The movie will most likely not grab guy's attention. The Julia part of the story takes place in 1949 and continues from there. Julia Child moved from China to France. She is an American. Just so you know. While her husband Paul(Stanley Tucci) is working, she tries writing a cookbook and cooking.So this film isn't a masterpiece. I'll tell you that.

77,Terrell-4,Close to perfection: Meryl Streep's Julia Child and Julia Child's Boeuf Bourguignon,8,2 September 2009,"Julie is cutesy; Julia is grand. That just about sums up Nora Ephron's movie, Julie & Julia. Ephron has taken Julie Powell's tale of deciding to make every single one of the recipes in Mastering the Art of French Cooking and doing it in one year and Julia Child's memoir of her life in France with her husband, Paul, as she learned to cook, plus other elements of her life. The result is a movie, half of which is a memorable delight and half of which is not bad, depending on your tolerance for New York's creative yuppie set As Julie (Amy Adams), cute and smart and wanting to be writer, works her way through the recipes, we get to meet her superficial and more successful Manhattan friends, her loving husband who eventually gets tired of the project and his wife's self obsession with it, and the gradual recognition of others, including some in the writing game, of what she's doing. She keeps a blog and seems as devoted to it as she is to Julia Child. Back and forth we go in flashback as we also see Julia Child (Meryl Streep) trying to find something to do in Paris where her husband has been assigned after the war, deciding to master great French cooking, and discovering that great cooking and eating well prepared food is what she enjoys the best. To the surprise of some, but not herself or her husband, she becomes a wonderful example of try, try again, hard work, indomitable perseverance and good humor...all voiced with her inimitable fluting exuberance. Within minutes we've forgotten Streep and are completely enchanted by one of our favorite people. The drawback to the movie is that Julie Powell's quest seems increasingly self-centered and insignificant compared to Julia Child's quest. With Julie we get all the requisite clichés of New York's younger set, including stylishly improvised dinner parties, a 900 square foot apartment (above a pizza restaurant), romantic tussles on the sofa, the anguish of misunderstandings and disappointments. Ah, but with Julia we are on a magnificent quest on a completely different level...to conquer doubt; to do things right even if it means dropping spoons on a floor; to make and keep friends; to take cooking seriously, but not oneself; and with Paul to have a happy, mutually supportive and very lusty partnership. It would take a shrewd and skilled actor to stand up to Streep's extraordinary ability to channel Julia Child's personality, manners and voice. Stanley Tucci, by underplaying, makes Paul Child into what he was in life, the rock upon which Julia Child depended. Not much in the movie, to Nora Ephron's credit, is played for easy laughs. The movie may generate endless platefuls of warm smiles and nods, but that's because Ephron and Streep have managed the remarkable feat of giving us the Julia Child we learned to love and learn from through her television programs. Julia Child on the screen is the woman we saw and remember with such affection. If only Ephron, with Streep's signature on the contract, had just dumped the Julie part and given us all Julia.",Julie & Julia

80,dglink,"Bon Appetite, but Watch the Butter and Cream!",8,10 August 2009,"Releasing a movie like ""Julie and Julia"" during the dog days of August is somewhat of a mystery. The teenage boys who dominate summer film attendance are still out of school and filling seats for action flicks about super heroes. Young children are still being ushered off to animated-feature matinées, dating couples are still making out during the latest Jennifer Anniston or Sandra Bullock romantic comedy, and mature adults are out of town on vacation. Thus, just who out there is going to watch Meryl Streep as a shrill voiced chef from the 1950's and Amy Adams as a contemporary blogger who cooks French food for a year? Unfortunately, many are going to miss this tasty soufflé.Meryl has great fun impersonating Julia Child in her formative years when she lived in Paris, attended cooking school, and began collaborative work on a French cookbook in English. Inter-cut with Julia Child's story is that of Julie Powell, a government worker caught in her cubicle. Julie finds escape in her cooking, idolizes Julia Child, and sets a goal to cook every recipe in Child's cookbook within a year, while blogging daily about the experience. Nora Ephron, who wrote and directed the film, draws parallels between the two women of different generations, which the editing underscores nicely. While the two women are well developed, the two husbands, Child's played by Stanley Tucci and Julie's played by Chris Messina, are perhaps a bit too sensitive and understanding to be completely believable. Although both actors are fine, the characters seem more a woman's idealization of husbands than flesh and blood men. Interestingly, neither the husbands nor the wives gain weight over the course of the story, despite the evident worship of butter, cream, and red meat on display.""Julie and Julia"" is glossy, entertaining fun. Often funny, always amusing, the film moves along swiftly, helped by telling two stories simultaneously. While Streep's is the showy performance, Amy Adam's work is arguably the more heartfelt and winning. Child is broad gestures and flamboyance, while Powell is introspective and intense. While both couples have marriages that work, the Powells seem connected, while the Childs at times appear comic. Small quibbles with a good movie, however. ""Julie and Julia"" is not a cinematic masterpiece, but rather a pleasant diversion and an oasis of intelligence in a sea of often-mindless summer films.",Julie & Julia
81,fwomp,Ingesting More Than You Can Handle,8,23 January 2010,"JULIE & JULIA was a surprisingly inspiring comedy/drama/romance that I found myself easily digesting. It wasn't just the food (although that certainly helped make me crave butter), but the easy romance that came from both the Julie side and Julia Childs' history.Although I'd never met Julia Child, nor seen her kitchen at the Smithsonian, nor read any of her books, I did see some of her television shows growing up thanks to my mother having the channel on a local PBS station. I remember wondering what was supposed to be so interesting about this large woman who often dropped, splattered, and messed up her food preparations. Ignorance in youth is a wondrous thing.As I grew up, I began to see Julia Childs' cookbooks all over; in friends homes, on every bookstore shelf. Hmm. Maybe I was missing something. And this movie shows me what I never understood as a kid. That this woman, this fumbling, laughing, good-natured lady, had done something that no other person had ever attempted. Not only did she invade the professional chef status of men in the kitchen, but she also made French cuisine accessible to millions of English readers.This story, which delves beyond cooking and into romance and the dramatic life Julia led, also introduces us to a new format for would-be chefs/authors: the blog. Amy Adams (SUNSHINE CLEANING) stars as Julie Powell, a woman with a desire to be a writer (or something) but has trouble getting going. Until one day she decides to try cooking all of Julia Childs' 500-plus recipes in her ""Mastering The Art Of French Cooking"" book in 365 days ...and blogging about it. Little does Julie know of the storm of followers she'll get. This all takes place about one year post-911 in New York, too. And Julie's husband Eric (Chris Messina, VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA) helps push her in the blogging direction, supporting her through the successes and many disasters, including a hilarious scene involving the demise of live lobsters.Contrasting with this is Julia Childs' life (Meryl Streep, MAMMA MIA!) in the late 1940s and early 1950s as she makes her way into Chefdom. Streep's performance is astounding and made me wonder if it were possible for her to actually play a bad part. She's such a chameleon that you never saw Streep, and only witnessed Childs extraordinary rise onto the cooking world stage. More underrated than probably any actor out there, though, is Stanley Tucci (THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA) as Julia's life-long husband, confidant, and lover, Paul. It was so endearing to see a man of this era support his struggling wife. He was always there for her, helping her, giving advice, photographing her ...and having a VERY healthy sex-life with her.The contrast between Julia's early life and Julie as a writer/blogger are interesting and hold enough modern-day visuals alongside mid-20th century Europe with its cobbled streets and post-WW II drabness to keep most viewers watching and engaged, even if they're not interested in the history of American cooking.The final point of interest for Julie & Julia is that it's funny. It is often effortlessly comical thanks to Streep's amazing performance. One particular scene that still stands out for me is when Julia meets up with her even taller sister Dorothy (Jane Lynch, FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION) and the two run at each looking more like Clydesdales about to connect headlong. The aforementioned lobster scene is also hysterical (as is one where Julia has to cut into a lobster's head). These situations are filmed with such exquisite ease that you can't help but laugh at them.Even if you have absolutely no interested in food or blogging, this film will surely have entertainment value for you. And if you are interested in either or both, beware; you just might end up ingesting more than you can handle.",Julie & Julia
82,rps-2,A joy to watch,9,3 January 2010,"What a wonderful, unique idea for a film. There have been other movies where two story lines have been intertwined, but never as well as this. And Meryl Streep.... She deserves an Oscar for an amazing performance. She WAS Julia Child. I don't know if she can cook. She sure can act! I would have given this a 10 but for what I considered some needless sex. This was a movie about COOKING fergawdsakes. Although there are no actual ""humping scenes"" several are implied. And for a film that attends well to detail, the scene in the Paris rail station is very disappointing. The train was obviously North American equipment, not European. So they shot it in Hoboken... They still could have done a rail station scene without actually showing a train. Better no train than the wrong one. Whatever... The film has humanity. It's hilariously funny in spots. And the way the two story lines are intertwined in time and space is brilliant. Good enough that I want to see it a second time!",Julie & Julia
83,Ruskington,A tale of two halves,6,26 August 2020,"Hopefully, as time goes on, the only thing I will remember from this mixed bag of a movie is Meryl Streep's remarkable lead performance. Streep is absolutely sensational as Julia Child, capturing all the charm and manner of her subject with frightening accuracy. If anything, the only criticism you could make is that she is actually a little too lovable when compared to Child- although that is hardly a bad thing.The other side of this story however, is not quite so palatable. Amy Adams and her fawning husband are so thoroughly obnoxious and self-satisfied it makes it painfully difficult to even watch their scenes. At times, it almost feels like an intentional foreshadowing of the rotten narcissistic social media society that was to soon follow in the 2010s.And how and why this film was stretched to two hours is entirely beyond me, there really was no need to pad it out so much. In the end, this excessive duration takes away from Streep's captivating and highly enjoyable performance which is a huge shame. A testimony to good acting but not to good film-making.",Julie & Julia
84,Rogue-32,Not Childish enough,5,8 August 2009,"I went into ""Julie & Julia"" with big expectations, looking forward to a movie about the infamous Julia Child, the 6 foot 2 former OSS 'spy' from Pasadena who rose to spectacular heights in the cooking world armed with nothing but wit, fortitude and an insatiable desire to learn.What I got instead was a sadly superficial, completely foam-headed affair which hardly does justice to Julia and which was made watchable only by the participation of its three stars.Stanley Tucci - the Toochinator, as I affectionately have named him - plays Paul Child, Julia's monumentally supportive husband, and he's wonderful, as always. Amy Adams, who is adorably charming and easy on the eyes, does what she can with her basically thankless role - she's the Julie of the title, Julie Powell, who is inspired by Child to write a blog about going through all the recipes in Child's book, Mastering The Art of French Cooking. Her story is told parallel to Child's, which I thought sounded like a cool idea going in but which turned out to be the film's undoing. Far too much screen time is squandered on this character, who, let's face it, is not that interesting. Instead, the film should have focused entirely on Child, whose story, in contract, is fascinating, inspiring and certainly deserving of more than this inconsequential piece of fluff.Meryl Streep, fearless actor that she is, does a relatively good job impersonating Child. However, Streep, being a Cancer, simply does not possess Child's Leonine ferocity; it's just not there and can never be. Still, her attempt is noble and the audience (in the packed theatre I saw the film in yesterday) ate it up.",Julie & Julia
85,Danusha_Goska,"Delightful Instant Classic. I Laughed. I Cried. But ""Julie"" Part a Bit Weak.",8,11 August 2009,"The good parts of ""Julie and Julia"" are so darn strong, beautiful, and new that J&J becomes an instant classic. Grateful audiences are going to be laughing and crying and being inspired by this movie for a long, long time. The Julie portion is the weaker of the two, but not so weak that it sinks the film.Meryl Streep as Julia Child is one of the most endearing, arresting performances ever. That the real Julia Child and her groupies irritate me no end in no way interfered with my appreciation of Streep's amazing characterization. I laughed and cried several times, I was so engaged in the cinematic Streep/Child's story.Streep's chemistry with Stanley Tucci as Paul Child, Julia's husband, is breathtaking. No attempt is made to make Streep or Tucci conventionally attractive. No attempt is made to make them look young and dewy – they weren't – Julia married Paul when she was in her thirties and he was ten years older. Julia is tall; Paul is short; Julia is loud; Paul is bald, quiet and retiring. It is implied that they can't have children. They don't share conventionally romantic movie moments; they don't ""meet cute,"" there's no candlelight, no slow dances, no full frontal nudity, no vulgar language (with one hilarious exception involving cannelloni).All Paul and Julia do is share the drudgery and rewards of working life: hers as a cook, his as a state department official. The key to Streep and Tucci's chemistry is that they portray two characters who love each other. Watching a loving, married couple in a marriage that works is one of the great, and sadly rare, pleasures of this film. Steep and Tucci are every bit as charismatic a couple as Tracy and Hepburn. Jane Lynch is also brilliant in a small role as Julia's sister.The Julia segments take place in post-war Paris, and the Paris of this film, one of elegant cafes, haute couture and vintage cars, is someplace we all wished we lived (except for the ever-present cigarette smoke.) No matter how you feel about cooking, the film gets you to care about Julia's slowly being drawn into her destiny as one of the legendary chefs of all time. You also care about, and respect, Paul, his career and its ups and downs in the McCarthy era, and his support of his wife.The Julie Powell portion of the movie is the weaker portion. I really like the film's structure of switching back and forth between contemporary Queens and post-war Paris, contrasting a career woman's attempt to cook all of Julia Child's recipes with Julia Child herself, before she became famous. I just think that the film fails its own structure by simply not making the Julie Powell portion as interesting as the Julia Child portion. Some have complained that Queens is depicted as being too dismal, and Paris too elegant. It's more than that, though.I think Ephron, a brilliant filmmaker, drops the ball with Julie Powell because she never engages the tough questions about Powell's experiment. Was Powell just someone eager for fame in the Warhol era of ""Everyone is famous for fifteen minutes""? Was Powell parasitizing Child's fame? Was Powell a bad wife to her husband as she obsessed on completing her self assigned task? Have blogs killed quality writing? Was Julia Child correct in her condemnation of Powell? I am not saying that the answer to any of the above questions is ""Yes."" I'm not bashing Julie Powell. I'm saying that by not engaging them, Ephron made the Julie portion of the film simply not as interesting as it could have been had these very real questions been engaged. Instead, Ephron tries to turn Julie into a cute, bland Meg Ryan character, and it never works, not for an instant. When Powell has lunch with her career gal friends, her friends are such Gordon Gecko style sharks that we care less for Powell for being so needy as to want to impress them. The absolute worst scene in the movie comes when Powell, who has never been depicted as feeling happy or fulfilled, not with her job, not with her husband, not with her home life, plays 65 answering machine messages from agents, editors, and publishers who want to make her famous. As these messages play, she has sex with her husband, and her husband's comment lets us know that this is the first time in a long while that he has experienced satisfaction from his wife.The message of that scene is so tawdry, it cheapens the glow created by the Julia portion of the film, that shows Julia Child achieving satisfaction *before she ever becomes famous*. Julia *loved* cooking. Julia *loved* her husband. Yes, she celebrates when Knopf wants to publish her book, but she is so divorced from the rat race that she doesn't even know how to pronounced ""Knopf"" – whether the initial K is silent.Julie Powell is depicted as needing fame to feel good about herself, and the movie never interrogates that. Had it done so, the Julie segments would have been as interesting as the Julia ones.In any case, this is a great film that will enjoy a much deserved embrace by its fans.",Julie & Julia
86,ajs-10,Two Stories... One Film,7,14 November 2010,"I wasn't quite sure I would like this film, for a start I have never heard of Julia Child, but I guess few people outside the USA that are not all that into food have. Don't get me wrong, I like to cook, it's one of those survival skills you pick up. I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm not what you might call a foodie. So I'll begin with a very brief summary (summary haters please look away while I type the next paragraph you can rejoin the group after).Two stories are told in parallel. First the story of how famous food writer Julia Child got her love of cooking, and how she came to write the well known book ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"". Julia's husband, Paul, is a diplomat who is stationed in Paris in the late 40's early 50's, and this is where Julia, needing something to do, decides to learn to cook. She meets two French ladies, Louisette Bertholle and Madame Brassart who are writing a French cook book for Americans. After their publishing deal falls through they ask Julia to help out, which she does and, after many years they finally get it published. The second story is that of Julie Powell who needs a focus in her life. At the suggestion of her husband, Eric, she decides to cook every recipe in Julia Child's book in one year. Not only that, but she will write a blog about her experiences. There are many highs and lows, but she eventually achieves her aim, which brings other, greater rewards.I found this film a little hard to watch, the constant jumping from one story to another got a little distracting at times. However, the scenes when Julia was in Paris really took me back. At one time I had a French girlfriend and we had some good times in Paris but I digress (again). I hear that Meryl Streep's performance as Julia Child is spot on. I'll have to take that on trust never having seen the original to compare. There were also good performances from; Amy Adams as Julie Powell, Stanley Tucci always good value as Paul Child and Chris Messina as Eric Powell.At the end of the day, yes, I did enjoy this film. Despite the slightly distracting jumping from story to story, I found it quite engaging. Although it's not the best film ever made, it is still pretty entertaining, and you can't ask for more than that. Over all a quite endearing film with some good performances. I find films based on fact are often quite interesting and this one is no exception recommended.My score: 7.1/10",Julie & Julia
87,gelman@attglobal.net,Streep is Wonderful and Who Cares about the rest?,8,24 November 2009,"All the critics are right about the contrivances in Julie & Julia, but Meryl Streep has Julia Child's voice down just right as well as her physical awkwardness, and whether Julie Palmer (Amy Adams) was trading on Julia's fame to further her own career is of no concern. Yes, much of the movie is devoted to Julie's frantic effort to cook every Child recipe in a year but the focus on Child and her husband (Stanley Tucci) is sufficient to show the spirit that Child mustered to break out of the limited channels available to a diplomat's wife to carve out an unlikely career as a chef and a popularizer of French cooking for American housewives. Amy Adams is a pleasant presence, and the fact that she really doesn't matter is of no consequence because she really doesn't matter.Could it have been done as a straight biography of Ms. Child. I suppose so but it would have had to be a very different and probably more self-conscious film. This one is fun, and Amy Adams contributes to the fun even though it's Meryl Streep you'll remember.",Julie & Julia

89,johnstonjames,Tasty Entertainment From Chef Ephron. Streep And Adams Are Scrumptious,8,28 June 2012,"just watched this movie last night the day of feminist director Nora Ephron's passing. i wasn't sure if i would be interested in a cooking type movie, but my interest was sparked by Ephron's death. i was pleasantly surprised by how thoughtful, charming and entertaining it was. Streep's resemblance to the legendary TV chef was uncanny.Ephron was a champion of woman's films and helped narrow the gap between male and female directors in the industry. her particular sensibilities will be missed but what she accomplished will live on indefinitely in popular cinema history.'Julie & Julia' is no mere art of cooking flick either. under it's surface lies a movie about feminine strengths and emotions. it is a view of the world through the eyes of the feminine. it's also unique in that it doesn't perceive feminism as a macho, butch ideal and that it doesn't scorn domesticated lifestyles. it's a film made for women and about women. people also forget, that even though cooking has become delegated to the housewife, chefs, gourmet chefs in particular, have mostly been men. in the case of the 1950's Cordon Bleu' cooking academy, exclusively ""a man's world"", and Julia Childs was a pioneer in bridging that gap.this is also a film about hero worship and celebrity idolization. it has good insights into why we are inspired and starstruck by great and famous achievers. it makes us aware of how personal they often become to us and sometimes can be the best friend we ever knew. this is evident in the loving way that the character Julie talks of having imaginary conversations with her hero and idol Julia. it is also about the disappointments of reality when we discover that these celebrities are fallible and flawed and human. the scene where Julie finds out that her hero Julia doesn't approve of or even like Julie, when Julia trashes Julie in a scathing newspaper comment, is insightful, amusing and touching, as to how Julie deals with such criticism.Meryl Streep and Amy Adams are two of the finest actresses working in the industry today, and especially in the case of young Amy Adams, i'm so glad Ephron had a chance to work with them before her passing.this is a wonderful and charming little film for women and just about anyone who has a sensitive spot for the larger than life celebrities they idolized during their youth. you don't have to be a woman or cook to relate to this delectable chickie flickie. in memory of Nora Ephron 6/2012.",Julie & Julia
90,Geeky Randy,"Don't judge a book, film, autobiography or memoir by its cover.",7,10 May 2010,"An interesting adaptation of Child's autobiography ""My Life in France"" and Powell's memoir. The film contrasts the lives of two different women in two different parts of the world, and comes full circle with the experience of cooking; one a culinary chef and inspiration, the other an aspiring cook inspired by Child's recipes. Streep and Adams are as good as usual, but once again the latter's performance is overshadowed much like it was in ""Doubt"", also by the veteran Streep. Masked as a chick-flick, but is really an intelligent and well-constructed film that everyone can enjoy. The wonderful settings from New York to Paris, with an enjoyable presence of Stanley Tucci as Child's husband are pluses. Certainly a film not to judge by its cover.*** (out of four)",Julie & Julia
91,SquigglyCrunch,Full of Fun and Plenty of Heart,8,24 January 2017,"Julie and Julia is the story of two women who love to cook. Specifically, it follows Julia Child in the years leading up to the publishing of her bestselling cookbook, as well as Julie Powell who starts a blog dedicated to her cooking all 524 recipes in Julia Child's cookbook in one year.When the movie started I worried. Meryl Streep as Julia Child was extremely frustrating to listen to, with her high voice and over- the-top acting. It was genuinely bothersome and I prepared myself for the worst. When Amy Adams came on screen, however, I figured maybe half the movie would be good. I'm happy to say that Streep grew on me as the world around her was made more authentic than previous, thus making her overdone personality fit right in. Plus I remembered seeing a Julia Child cooking video and realized she acted like that in real life. As for Adams, this is one of my favorite performances from her. She nailed her character so well, and her story was all the more intriguing to watch because of that. Speaking of which, contrary to common opinion, I found Julie Powell's section of the movie to be much more engaging than Julia Child's. Sure, I enjoyed Child's part, but Powell was a much deeper and more engaging character, so her parts were a real treat. It was something of a letdown when Child received so much more attention than her, with portions of her story stretching on far longer than Powell's. One thing that both stories captured so fantastically, however, were the relationships. Both Julia and Julie have authentic relationships with their on-screen husbands, which was something I really didn't expect from a movie described by critics simply as a 'feel-good movie'. I found myself captivated by both relationships, and when things went sour I hoped for the best. Overall Julie and Julia is an authentic, well-acted movie full of heart and just enough humor. In the end I would recommend it.",Julie & Julia
92,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Soothing Simmer,6,31 March 2012,"""That's what's so great about blogs. You don't have to be published. You can just go online, press enter, and there it is, out there."" Finer words have never been spoken in a motion picture by the husband of working girl Julie Powell, who decided to make every recipe in Julia Child's famous first cookbook... from desserts to ducks and equaling over 500 dishes... in a year's time. And most importantly, to journal them in her very own blog.Meanwhile, the real thing, Julia Child, is shown in Paris in the 1950's learning how to cook and then deciding to write a cook book for ""serventless Americans"" who yearn to serve French food. The iconic Hollywood actress Meryl Streep obviously savors the role as Child, but her voice and mannerisms often border on imitation. While Amy Adams plays Powell with the kind of spunky animation you'd see in a sitcom.As Child struggles to get her book published, Powell has fewer problems and her blogging seems a mere shortcut to the real work done by her mentor, who, it turns out, wasn't Powell's fan for this very reason.But as a movie, both characters provide an equally interchangeable meat and potatoes to a nice dish that'll keep you interested in either outcome. While you know Child will succeed, and that Powell's blog resulted in the movie being watched, there's still a page-turning intrigue to this duel tale of a legend and her dedicated superfan's clever idea. Because that can be all it takes to climb the fence. Some coattails go a long way.For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com",Julie & Julia
93,mukava991,legend playing legend,8,30 August 2009,"The Meryl Streep juggernaut of finely engineered acting pyrotechnics rolls on through 2009 with a bulls-eye impersonation of the late, great chef Julia Child. What makes this solidly constructed pairing of two parallel stories memorable is the absolute rightness of the towering on-camera actress of her era playing the towering figure of a previous era in the field of cooking, and investing the performance with all of the passion and sensitivity that the subject deserves and indeed embodied in her own way. The two plots juxtapose the linked evolution of Julia Child with Julie Powell. The former starts out as a restless post-WW2 wife, develops into world class chef-educator by deciding in middle age to learn French cooking and attend the Cordon Bleu school in Paris, thereafter writing a landmark book on the subject, and of course ending up as the first renowned TV chef; the latter begins as a post-9/11 government help-line representative, then advances to internet blogger sharing with the world her efforts to cook her way through Child's classic MASTERING THE ART OF FRENCH COOKING in 365 days, finally emerging as an in-demand author in her own right. When we are not mesmerized by Streep's uncanny channeling of Child (she gets her subject right down to the wheezing breath) we are quietly rooting for Powell (a quietly determined Amy Adams) to reach her daunting goal. But admittedly, the Adams part of the story, set in a drab apartment in 21st century Queens, lacks the color and excitement of Streep's, set in the lushly romantic Paris of the early Cold War era and centering on an eccentric and larger- than-life individual.Stanley Tucci, as Child's husband Frank, complements Streep perfectly as a loving husband, just as he did in THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA as the harassed and somewhat hostile assistant. One more cinematic pairing like this and his obit will start with ""co-star of Meryl Streep."" Chris Messina has the same relatively thankless position here as Adrian Grenier had in PRADA – the attractive but bland mate of the secondary actress who gets shuffled to the side by demands of the plot and can only annoy the audience by daring to occupy the screen during a Meryl Streep movie.One thing that surprised me was that Powell does not remove the rubber bands from the claws when she steams lobster.

Their husband/boyfriends are played by Tucci and Messina, also they do a good job. Its kind of like the older generation of great actors vs. the new one :)The story is good, long but good, this could have been at least half an hour shorter if that was what the director etc. had gone for. But it wasn't, this film was to show Julies and Julias struggles in their time and their hard work to get appreciated and loved.This movie will tell you a lot about Julia Child and her life, but you still have to buy her book to learn and experience the dishes yourself.",Julie & Julia

The movie was absolutely correct; it is a manual on the preparation of French food and the steps allowed a total novice like me to prepare excellent quenelles, various sauces and desserts. The accuracy of the movie was amazing in that the reason Julia Child started the project was to teach Americans how to prepare French food and, at least in my case, that is exactly what she did. I do not know much about Julie but I think the script and director softened the character substantially in the movie. That has no impact whatsoever on the film that you see. I was engrossed by the story and enjoyed it thoroughly from its beginning in post-war Paris to the scenes with Julie in Queens, New York. My words are insufficient to laud Meryl Streep for the accuracy with which she portrayed Julia Child. I have DVDs of Julia's original cooking show episodes and Streep's character was as accurate as humanly possible, in my opinion. There was not a foot out of place with this film; make every effort to see it. If you don't like cooking, see it for Streep's extraordinary depiction of an American icon.",Julie & Julia
96,estreet-eva,Tune in for Streep and skim through the Adams pieces,5,5 December 2011,"Meryl Streep brings to bear her full acting arsenal against the unique personage that was Child?oh, and there?s some other stuff in the movie as well. Streep nails the accent, the physical movements, the facial expressions, all of it in a near duplication of Child?s unusual size and physical mannerism so familiar to the audience through her long-running cooking show. Watching it you get the sense that each gesture and change in expression is the product of thoughtful consideration prior to the filming of the scene and long rehearsal in pre-production. A real acting tour de force (seems appropriate to borrow from the French here). Oh and there is this secondary story staring the always compelling Amy Adams as a Queens blogger who, for reasons known only to the apparent masses with little better to do then read her blog about cooking Child?s recipes, rises to a ?00s type of fame. Adams does her best with a pretty thin script and rote plot (she hates her job, she cooks, she types, she argues with the spouse ? sound familiar to you?) Stanley Tucci as Paul Child and Chris Messina as long-suffering husband also perform well but essentially function to provide reaction shots to the histrionics of the main female characters. The film would have been much improved to have reduced the ?Julie? half into a framing device and spent the time exploring themes that are only touched on in Julia?s story including her relationship to her father, her sorrow over never having children and the genesis of the television show (her story ends with the publishing of her book).

Queens and back and forth multiple times, following the lives of two couples, one we should care about, and the other that nobody really gives a damn about. The only really interesting thing about this trifle is French cooking, and few talented but sadly underused supporting actresses like Helen Carey and Linda Emond.

103,eddax,More about Meryl Streep's acting prowess than Julia Child,7,16 February 2010,"The main point of the movie seems to be how well Meryl Streep imitates Julia Child, with a lesser emphasis on two women from different generations who achieve their dreams through cooking. That's the problem with too much hype sometimes.It was a pleasant movie, though not as much a food one as one would think - there weren't enough loving shots of the dishes prepared. Like most other people I imagine, I enjoyed Streep's scenes more than Amy Adams', not just because of the former's performance but also because of the art direction of those scenes set in France. Adams's character also had the disadvantage of being needy and obsessive, which made the balance even more uneven. Surely the director could've seen that, though I have no suggestions for how Nora Ephron could've fixed it. Meryl Streep as a cheery Julia Childs in France vs. Amy Adams as a whiny Julie whomever in an apartment in New York. I love Adams but no one could stand up to those odds.I love Streep too but I'm getting kinda tired of her getting Oscar nominations for roles that are caricature-ish and well within her reach. It'd be great to see a strong, subtle performance from her again, like with The Bridges of Madison County.",Julie & Julia
104,yris2002,"Warm, funny and inspiring",7,29 December 2009,"I adore movies dealing with food, I like both eating and cooking, and believe that people who love eating have something more in terms of life enjoyment, in the same way as people who love cooking show more care for others. In accordance with all my predictions, this movie is warm, entertaining and really tastes good, Meryl Streep never disappoints and is always a guarantee of very good interpretations (unfortunately, in this case ""ruined"" by the Italian dubbing, her voice is quite annoying). Also Amy Adams as Julie, delivers a tender and comforting performance, she is a very positive and trusting young woman, who started to cook just to fill her life with a long-term project, as a form of sublimation of personal deficiencies, and eventually discovers how cooking for others is a way to give joy to others, and to ourselves, of course. As it happens in all these kinds of movies, the sense element plays the main role as we can almost smell, touch, taste the delicacies created in the kitchen, or at least would like to do that. As a whole, a very pleasant piece of cinema, supported by a good photography, an intelligent script and good performances. A picture I would recommend if you would like to enjoy two hours of relax and fun; I would only advise not to see it while hungry!",Julie & Julia
105,rollernerd,I am already hungry!!,7,30 September 2020,"Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Today's movie review is the comedy drama Julie & Julia (2009) starring the queen herself Meryl Streep as Julia Childs and Amy Adams as Julie Powell, both women who may be separated by time but have a shared passion of fearlessness and food. Both of write memoirs, one through text and the other through the net. We have Julie who is blogging on a daily basis about her attempt to try and finish all 524 recipes from Julia Child's cookbook in 365 days. We have many years prior to Julie, Julia Childs who is discovering her passion for French cuisine and her persistence to introduce it to the American public.Streep's acting makes the film worthwhile, her greater-than-life on-screen persona along with comedic timing is on point. Streep's chemistry with Stanley Tucci as Paul Child, Julia's supportive diplomatic husband, is great where we have two real life characters portrayed as loving each other in a marriage that just works. The Julia segments take place in beautiful scenes in France and you get drawn into her deep dive into French cuisines and becoming one of the legends of a well-known cooking teacher. It then switches into early 2000s Queens, New York where Julie Powell is slowly trying to follow the footsteps of someone she has never met. What did lack was to question Powell's cooking experiment - was it fame, self-reflective of one's ability or just did it to feel good about herself? The film doesn't look into this which would've enhances the Powell story. Overall if you're into food and never giving up on your dreams then give this a crack overall 7.8/10",Julie & Julia
106,Dunham16,intertwined memoirs from the 1950's and the early millennium i,9,16 April 2015,"Julia Child published in 2004 a memoir of her time in France fifty years earlier. The same year Julie Powell published a blog of her year cooking through a cookbook Julia and Simone Beck co-authored in 1961. Nora Ephron often spins fictitious romances about a young lady fish out of water in New York City. She places Julie Powell as emigrating from Texas to live in Queens taking the wrong subway every day to a stressful job in downtown Manhattan. On the NYC subway map the elevated train she boards to Manhattan does not go to where she is supposed to work but a subway train directly underneath the station her character boards certainly does in real New York City. Ephron doesn't film her character boarding the logical train which goes directly to her job as a way of establishing her take on Julie Powell. Julia and her husband are played by Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci. Julie and her husband are played by Amy Adams and Chris Messina. The fifth lead member of the large, tight ensemble cast is Linda Edmond playing Simone Beck, Julia's muse in France.Always insightful, well filmed and edited, always revealing truths about human nature it is a two hour comparison of the parallels of two women capitalizing on something which fascinates them to escape from an otherwise unexciting and uneventful existence.",Julie & Julia
107,ferdinand1932,Croque Madame,6,13 March 2010,"There are two ordinary dishes served in French bistros: Croque monsieur and Croque madame (croque means bite). Essentially they are eggs, ham bread and a tasty cheese and mustard sauce. Like a lot of pleasing food it is not complicated, but it's not that special either.This movie falls into the same category. While the script does a fine job at welding two stories separated by time, the overall and completed effect is like reading a magazine article with very good photographs. There is no drama in this movie at all. While it passes, it's all good to look at and the stories are not dull, but it's still a movie without a central coherent dramatic axis.OK, so Julie's personal problems at turning 30 and her husband are not really the material of a full blooded drama. It would have made a very good documentary, or one of those ""Looking back at America discovers cuisine"" type of TV shows.The TV film of Britain's queen of cooking, Elizabeth David A Life in Recipes, does have drama.Still, Julia Child emerges from this as a strong, even eccentric, personality. And La Streep's performance is almost too strong for the piece.",Julie & Julia
108,ldavis-2,The Misadventures of Madame Ham and Worker Drone!,2,16 May 2010,"In Julie & Julia, Julie Powell is shattered when a reporter informs her that Julia Child is not amused by the blog that Julie is writing as she plows through all 524 recipes of Julia's magnum opus, Mastering the Art of French Cooking. The scene wants us to conclude that Julia was a crotchety old fart who wouldn't have recognized an homage if it jumped onto her dowagers hump! But - as they say - the truth hurts. The real reason why Julia was not amused, her editor Judith Jones told The Boston Globe in 2009, was because the ""homage"" was stuffed like a bad Cannoli with four-letter words: ""that isn't how you describe food if you care and if you're a good writer"". Julia concluded that Julie was not a serious cook, and the blog was a stunt. Unfortunately for Julia - and humanity - the stunt worked!But - as they also say - why let the facts get in the way of a good story? Nora Ephron sure as hell doesn't, hence, the totally-fictitious scene of Julia locking horns with her snootier-than-thou father over Joe McCarthy at Dorothy's wedding reception. McCarthy didn't have the pull to order his mother, much less Julia's husband, to Washington to be grilled on how American they were. In case anyone cares, Mr. McWilliams was actually a supporter of Richard Nixon, and Dorothy was married in New York City, not France.Some of the reviews I read gushed over Streep's shameless grandstanding to the point where I wondered if the reviewers had been bought off. The less said about Adams, the better: she is whiny, self-absorbed, and utterly unlikeable. Moreover, Ephron's obvious disdain for anything that smacks Red State is so severe, she has the Texas born-and-bred Julie speak with the most mind-numbing monotone this side of Kevin Costner.Did we really need to see Madame Ham get her freak on? Did we really need to see Worker Drone kill not one, not two, but three lobsters with a pot three lobster sizes too small? Did I really need to waste two hours of my life on this pretentious bore-fest when shoving bamboo rods under my fingernails would have been way more constructive?",Julie & Julia
109,grahamclarke,No flies on Julia,4,8 November 2009,"Essentially two movies rolled into one. The rise of Julia Child to cooking guru status and the quest of a young woman to cook her way through Child's famous cookbook.The Julia Child part is as entertaining and fun to watch as you could expect from the likes of Meryl Streep in the title role; no more, no less.As for the second story, well Nora Ephron must have sorely wished to conclude her movie with young Julie inviting her idol and guardian cooking angel Julia Child for dinner. Unfortunately for her, in reality the no nonsense Julia Child clearly wanted no part of this circus. Nobody could pull the wool over Julia's eyes – she was not one bit impressed by some misguided young woman cooking her way through her famous book and reporting on this daily on a blog. How right she was. Even for someone like myself with an interest in cooking, its hard to muster up interest in the spurious and somewhat hedonistic aforementioned quest.The film wastes Streep's wonderful performance by bogging it down with the irritating and unnecessary second story. Pity. With a different concept, this could have been one terrific movie.",Julie & Julia
110,GirishGowda,Bon Appetit!,8,20 May 2010,"This is my first Meryl Streep movie and I had lots of high expectations from her because she was nominated for more than 16 Oscars in her career. And Amy Adams is an actress I really like. So, I knew that I would like this movie even though its about food and I am a young guy who loves good food. After I watched this I have to disagree with many comments here who have told that Julie Powell's story was a distraction. It only helped us connect more to the story. This movie was concocted with oodles of love as its basic ingredient. Love, we as an audience, feel for the characters.Based on a true story, this movie intertwines two lives; with Julia Child's story of her start in the cooking profession in the 1960's or 70's in Paris, along with a normal everyday woman, Julie Powell who works in a cubicle in 2002. To make her life more worthwhile, Julie challenges herself to cook from Julia Child's first cookbook which has 524 recipes in just 365 days. To make sure she doesn't back out in the middle, she starts to blog about her cooking. There are many ups and downs in her relationship with her husband. We also get a view into the life of Julia Child.Julia Child (Meryl Streep) is loud, always a happy person, tall, huge and not your conventional beauty. Her husband Paul Child (Stanley Tucci) is quiet, handsome, bald, silent and a retiring government agent. The chemistry of Julia with her husband Paul is really wonderful and everyone, no matter their beauty quotient, would love to be like this couple. They don't have the conventional soppy, mushy romantic moments; they don't have a candlelight dinner, no slow dances. They just have this incredible chemistry that one would love to have in their life. Meryl Streep wonderfully brings Julia Child's child-like qualities to life. Julia only sees the upside to life most of the times and she is an amazing person to be friends with. Stanley Tucci is excellent as Paul Child. Their moments are so personal and genuine and beautiful that sometimes I felt like a pervert who was poking around in their life, without minding my own business. Julia Child constantly made me smile. Their story takes place in Paris which has elegant cafes, vintage cars and the very culture is romantic.Though Nora Ephron brings such an endearing Julia Child, she takes it down a few notches in the portrayal of Julie Powell. I am in no ways telling that Amy Adams did a bad job. In fact, I think she gave some depth to whatever the real Julie Powell's character was missing. Julie is very bored of her life and wants a goal in her life so she can feel better about her life. She always wanted to be a writer, but had ended up getting a cubicle job at an helpline center. One day, while goofing around with her husband, they decide that it would be best for her to cook all the recipes in Julia Child's first cookbook. She likes the challenge and the rest of her story is about cooking those wonderful dishes and her relationship with Eric, her husband. Julie's story takes place in an everyday apartment and this only adds fuel to the viewers wishes of seeing Julia Child in elegant Paris. Amy Adams is very beautiful and I have a small crush on her. She is so cute and bright as Julie, that one can't really dislike her for portraying such a character, who is basically trying to popularise herself by writing about Julia Child. Nora Ephron doesn't engage in tough questions about Powell's experiment. Julie Powell is depicted as needing fame to feel good about herself, and the movie never interrogates that. Had it done so, the Julie segments would have been as interesting and rapturing as the Julia ones.In any case, this film is great and should be embraced by everyone who is a fan of these actors, food and Paris. I give 5 on 5 for Julia Child segments and 3 on 5 for Julie Powell segments. And oh, I am glad I rented and saw this in home because I was feeling hungry for the most part. Make sure you have food to eat while watching this; not popcorn, pizzas and sodas, but real food.8/10",Julie & Julia
111,hfan77,One of the Year's Best Films,9,27 October 2009,"My mom, girlfriend (who is also named Julia) and I saw Julie & Julia and we were all impressed. Amy Adams was outstanding as Julie Powell, who blogged her attempts to cook every recipe that was in Julia Child's cookbook and Meryl Streep, though much shorter than the real-life French Chef, played the role to perfection, even to her frequently impersonated high-pitched voice. Let's not overlooked the men who played their respective partners, Chris Messina and Michael Tucci.Even though trying to keep track of two story lines was a bit difficult, the one thing that stood out was all the dishes Julie prepared were really good. To me, it's the yummiest movie Julia and I have seen since Waitress.It was also a real nice touch to add a clip of the Saturday Night Live sketch with Dan Aykroyd as Julia Child. Though I'm not a fan of blood scenes, it still was so funny. There was also a vintage black and white clip of The French Chef with Julia Child that added nostalgia.My late Aunt Toby, who was a big Francophile and a fan of Julia Child since she lived for many years in Cambridge, MA would have loved the movie. She would have seen it in previews, in a regular and second-run theatre and eventually on DVD. Julie & Julia should deserve consideration for the Oscars. Bon appetit.",Julie & Julia
112,Irie212,"""Julia hates me!"" and for good reason.",5,10 December 2009,"The moment that Julie flops on her bed, lamenting ""Julia hates me!"" is the only moment that made me credit writer/director Ephron with some small degree of insight and artistry, because in that moment Ephron acknowledges that Julie deserves no admiration for her kitchen marathon. Throughout the movie, it's obvious that the supremely accomplished Julia Child would never have respected Julie Powell for turning the former's masterpiece into the latter's superficial stunt. Streep is superb as Julia Child, playing her as she gloriously was, larger than life and vull of vigor, making believable her passion for food and for cooking. Amy Adams is fine, too, but Julie is a thankless role. The most obvious problem: Only a fool would cook 524 recipes in 365 days, let alone 524 French haute cuisine dishes from a two- volume tome that, incidentally, isn't a simple cookbook. And by the way, Julie the fool would also have to be (1) wealthy enough to afford the rich and meaty ingredients and the well-equipped kitchen that the 524 recipes call for, and (2) willing to eat leftover boeuf Bourguignon or lamb stuffed with kidneys for breakfast or lunch.But let's just accept that Julie is a determined fool (and a wealthier one than she pretended). What I could not accept in Ephron's formulaic film or in Powell's original project is the fact that Julie never actually learns how to cook, or even seems to want to learn-- yet she miraculously succeeds in nearly every recipe the first time! She cooks by rote, more like an assembly-line worker at an auto plant than a creative chef. Hardly admirable, or believable. Julie needed to be a woman with the soul of a gourmand. She isn't. She's a blogger with the soul of a clerk.",Julie & Julia

Meryl Streep makes a wonderful Julia Child with boundless energy and optimism that is impossible not to smile at. However, sometimes it is easy to become annoyed with the characters. The meltdowns they have seem so stupid and ridiculous you just want to slap them. But regardless, it is a lovely, cute movie that is a welcome distraction.",Julie & Julia
114,Gideon24,"Streep is the show here, as usual",8,23 May 2015,"2009's Julie and Julia is a lovely and lavishly produced comedy-drama, which is a near perfect melding of two separate true stories that are more similar than they appear to be on the surface.The film opens in 1940's Paris with renowned chef Julia Child and her husband Paul moving to France and showing a discontent Julia enrolling in Le Cordon Bleu in a class of all men and then devoting her life to an elaborate cookbook of french cooking. The film then shifts to Queens, New York in 2002 where we meet Julie Powell, a government employee who is a great cook and kind of obsessed with Julia Child and has decided to give herself 1 year to cook every dish in Julia's book and blog about it. The film then alternates between the two stories whose connection seems paper-thin but becomes more clear as the film progresses.Meryl Streep adds another remarkable performance to her gallery of memorable characters in her vivid and full-bodied performance as Julia Child and anyone who has ever seen Child on TV cannot argue the fact that Streep nails this character...every nuance of Julia's physical being beautifully realized by a master craftsman. Amy Adams somehow manages to make Julie Powell likable enough that we actually stay awake during Julie's story.Stanley Tucci is quietly brilliant as Paul Child, Julia's neglected but never taken for granted husband, and Chris Messina is fun as Julie's husband Eric. I also loved Linda Emond as Julia's writing partner and a brief but flashy turn by Jane Lynch as Julia's sister.The film boasts impressive production design and Nora Ephron's direction is solid, though her screenplay loses points for revealing that Julia Child hated Julie's blog, but the film is still a must-see, if for nothing else, for the gift that keeps on giving, Meryl Streep. BTW, the voice of Julie's mother on the phone is supplied by Mary Kay Place.",Julie & Julia
115,maximkong,Meryl Streep failed to 'streep' herself to fit into Julia's shoes,4,23 November 2012,"Under normal circumstances, I like movies that indulge in interesting perspectives of how people cope with ups and downs in their lives. The manipulation of two characters' lives to demonstrate a certain relationship across timelines was a unique combination in this recipe and it is fairly impressive. The food made me pretty hungry too! However, there are moments in the film that do not seem to contribute to the overall plot and I thought the movie would have been a lot better by sacrificing a bit of the footage on food and focus more on character development, especially the final quarter of the film which I felt was kinda rushed and inconclusive.Contrary to many remarks made here, Streep was a huge disappointment. I was convinced that Streep was carried away in her role because she was playing 'Meryl Streep' as like in her many other films instead of 'Julia Child' which was utterly regrettable. I can say this for sure because I have watched several clips of Julia herself on youtube and can immediately tell the differences between the real person and Streep's version by a yard mile. In that retrospect, Amy Adams definitely scored better as a lead actress",Julie & Julia
116,ltlacey,The true lives of 1 very famous person and 1 who now is (sort of),5,8 December 2009,"I am beginning to realize, from reading a lot of comments, that you are either going to totally love this movie, totally hate this movie, or like me, find it vaguely boring and so-so. Wait. That just about covers it all. Streep nails Child beautifully, but again, sometimes it felt over the top. And someone with her caliber should not have to be in a movie where so many technical goofs are easily seen. Show the woman some respect! Adams, though getting better at not playing ditzy roles, somehow returned to one, though it was not so bad that I had to turn the movie off. I would have wanted more of the trials and tribulations a woman from Child's era had to face, what with being a woman, and seen more than 1 mishap involving preparing all of Child's recipes by Julie. Throughout the entire movie I felt like something was missing. Maybe it was the bad script; though you could easily follow along who we were with at the time (Julia or Julie). For such a long movie I expected more. And from the talent behind the scenes I expected a lot more. We finally had a topic that had not been done in ""Hollywood"" and for the most part it was a disappointment.",Julie & Julia
117,seaview1,JULIE & JULIA Serves a Tasty Dish,8,30 August 2009,"Take equal parts Meryl Streep and Amy Adams. Add a dash of Stanley Tucci and have chef/director Nora Ephron whip up a delicious patisserie of confectionery delight in the true tale, Julie & Julia. Combining two source books, Julie Powell's Julie & Julia and Julia Child's My Life in France, Ephron's screen adaptation parallels the lives of up and coming master chef Child and aspiring writer Powell who uses Child's cookbook as the inspiration for her ambitious blog. The results, while not a five star meal, is certainly an entertaining, well acted drama highlighted by some amusing situations.Two married women from different times and places yearn to satisfy their inner desire for independence. In 1949, Julia Child and her US civil servant husband, Paul, are stationed in Paris, France. Wanting to do something besides sitting around like other wives of the period, she endeavors a variety of classes from hat making to bridge lessons until she and Paul hit upon the fact that she loves to eat. Thus she embarks on a mission to conquer cooking schools and the art of culinary cuisine. In 2002, with similar desires for a more fulfilling life as an author, Julie Powell is getting adjusted to Queens, New York, with her husband, Eric. Powell's frustrations are channeled into a blog that documents her attempts to realize all 524 recipes in Julia Child's famous cookbook in 365 days no less. The two lead characters depend on the publishing world for success-Child with her constantly delayed French cookbook manuscript that grows to 700 pages and the doubting responses of skeptical publishers, and Julie with her daily blogs as her way of garnering attention from a publisher. Both women's lives are set on a journey of self discovery and validation as they find that their goals will be sprinkled with adversity and roadblocks. Ultimately it will be their sheer will, self reflection, and the love of their respective spouses that will see them through in their quests. Streep is perhaps the best actress of the past thirty years and this role only serves to elevate her status. Although the role is not a tortured soul as in Sophie's Choice or Kramer vs. Kramer, she embodies Child as a larger than life bon vivant while mimicking her voice and mannerisms with startling acumen and enthusiam. Child's character gets more development than Powell. As she walks with Paul, her subtle reaction to a baby carriage and subsequent meltdown at the news of her sister's pregnancy is an interesting revelation. Her love of French food becomes an avocation and her life's calling. The cooking moments are convincing including a cute sequence involving chopped onions that will have audiences chuckling. She is a woman's libber by default as she attends a more advanced, male dominated cooking class. It's a pity that any actor in a Streep film would suffer by comparison. Yet Adams throws herself in the more contemporary but less developed role with gusto. Her role is more of the everywoman who cooks as a form of therapy. Powell's background can't quite compete with the rich history of Child's origins, but what she does get is a following and respect from fans and publishers. What Ephron should have done toward the end is to reemphasize how Powell's inability to finish anything of merit has come full circle with this accomplishment and would have provided a more compelling character development. Stanley Tucci is a standout who more than holds his own with Streep's Child. It is an Oscar-worthy performance. Chris Messina is a star on the rise as Eric Powell; he performs well with an essentially one note role. There are nice moments including an amusing scene when Julie and Eric watch Dan Aykroyd's classic Saturday Night Live take on Julia Child. A subplot involving the House Un-American Activities Committee detracts from the overall spirit of Child's story, and the film does slow a bit in the last half-hour but never loses interest completely. Ephron does well by linking similar themes and events that each woman experiences thus providing a bond and segue over time and space. One wishes that there was a more direct connection between the two women and even a chance meeting, but we have to settle for indirect links and the sharing of kindred spirits. Don't expect anything more than an interesting character study of two women bound by a love for food and search for purpose in their lives. Julie & Julia is light but satisfying fare highlighted by a sumptuous main course, Meryl Streep. Bon appetite!",Julie & Julia

On the other side, you meet a relatable woman struggling to find her own identity in Julie Powell.

Julie soon realizes that it is difficult to become another person just because one has aspirations to do what the other does best. Mery Streep as Julia Child is very convincing . But then, nothing is difficult for Mery Streep.

Meryl Streep is a great actress. Julie and Julia is directed well. Nora Ephron has found a Meg Ryan in Amy Adams. Amy Adams was excellent in Enchanted,Doubt and now Julie and Julia. This movie is Oscar worthy. Stanley Tucci who plays the role of Paul Child , does a great job as the very encouraging and emotionally stable husband of Julia .

Speaking of actresses, I can show off a bit that I have favorite female actress and this is Meryl Strip. Actors like her and like Tom Hanks are capable of acting everything.And now, what is important? It is important to try to make some habits, to follow our heart in our love affairs and our artistic affairs. And yes, it is important to us if we have artistic plan that heats up the fire of our passionate existence in this otherwise so gloomy and sad historical and factual world. Realizing that our momentary existence results from our past activities and our dreams - result from our future activities. The desire to succeed without being helped and to know who are the closest ones to us. Who are they or how we recognize them?

Her body of work is a gallery of character without parallel. After 3 decades she is still brand new. She never became a parody of herself like many other great actresses before her and, chances are, she never will. Here she recreates a popular icon, fearlessly. Her joy is utterly contagious and her side of the film is a marvel. Amy Adams, good as she is, becomes an unwelcome distraction. We want to stay with Meryl's Julia all the way. I think that Norah Ephron (Mixed Nuts) must have known, she must have! Didn't she notice in the cutting room, that we were going to be turning away from the story every time we move away from Julia Child? In any case I'm glad we had the chance to see this new Meryl Streep creation. Kudos also to Stanley Tucci. Stanley and Meryl create one of the most original believable couples in decades.

From the beginning, Streep was hilarious as Julia. One may have to know a little about Julia Childs to truly appreciate that person and the person that Streep portrayed. The voice was perfect, the characterizations were absolutely believable, and the spirit of the character was more lovable and endearing than I cared to take time to realize when she was with us. The relationship between Julia and her husband were beautiful and hilarious. You just cannot take your eyes off Julia no matter who she is seen with.Bear in mind, I did not go because this was a movie about Julia Childs. Nor did I go because of Meryl Streep. I went for Amy Adams and Meryl Streep. We know now that Amy Adams teamed up with Meryl Streep is a very good thing. Amy alone is one of the sweetest and cutest female actresses in the business. While I have not seen everything she has done, I have loved everything I have seen. Perfect as the imperfect princess in ""Enchanted"" she was as enchanting in Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day. Her Julie in Julie and Julia was more ""real"" working a job and beginning a career as blogger about something she knew little of - cooking like Julia Childs. Her blogs and determination to learn how to cook seemed to take over her everyday life, bringing out moments we can all relate to involving parents, friends and lovers. Painful as some things can be, we can look back and laugh when true love empowers.This is a solid movie with great acting by all(with Stanley Tucci doing the best I can remember him ever doing) and writing that is hard to beat. I will see this again and get the DVD when it comes out. Take your family even though Julia does mention a male part once and Paul drops an ""F"" bomb once. The laughter is exhilarating and healing.9 of 10 instead of 10 of 10 partly because I wanted a different ending.",Julie & Julia
126,Scoval71,Delightful. Eat it up!,10,18 April 2010,"Saw it three times. Always a delightful movie. So well made. Casting is superior. Amy and Meryl again. I think they are wonderful together, although in this film, they are not in any scenes together. Interesting. The story of a NYC woman with a quest to cook all of Julia Child's recipes, and how Child herself came to write her book, paralleled with the biography of her life. I also found out this was based on a true story. Tucci and Streep, together again, and the perfect casting as her husband, Paul. Just a delight. You will be thoroughly entertained. This is a funny, touching movie, and Meryl Streep always has a knack for accents is so funny as Julia Child. A movie that is a comedy, a drama, and a biography. See it.",Julie & Julia
127,jacklmauro,Ephron. Ephron. Why?,4,3 October 2010,"Here's the deal: take away Streep and what you have is a pile of ribbons on the floor. Once again and true to everything she's ever done, writer/director Nora Ephron takes a big budget and makes a box of candy. In a sense her style is as identifiable as Hitchcock's or Billy Wilder's - you know an Ephron as the credits role over the glossed-over, 'real' street scenes. And you absolutely know it's a Nora because pretty much nothing is going to happen beyond what you knew was going to happen, and knew usually from the title alone. What makes it all extra insulting is the guise at authenticity; even the lower-rent Queens apartment the couple takes is dirty, kind of, but in a non-dirty way. When they fight, as per all Ephron dialogue, it's a concept of how people fight and it feels as hopelessly false as it is. Don't get me wrong. I don't like grim, ugly films that go in the opposite direction and present ugliness for its own sake (Cohen brothers). But, for God's sake, Nora. A feel-good film is fine but even that has to be well-made and bear a resemblance to living people, and not appealing templates of people. Most of all, though - there is NO REAL STORY of any kind, as per all Ephron's stuff. Not even some realistic tension regarding the fitting in of all those complex recipes in a working like.",Julie & Julia
128,mcsheehey,A Well-Cooked Meal,8,19 January 2010,"""Julie and Julia"" works. It uses an approach that we've seen before (The Hours, Iris, The Godfather Part II), in which stories from different time periods are placed in a blender and mixed into a smooth double-(or triple-) layered narrative structure. Fortunately, Nora Ephron's script is lively and fun enough to make the approach appear fresh, or at least interesting.Amy Adams and Meryl Streep lead the cast as Julie Powell and Julia Child, respectively. Powell is a perpetually depressed government worker who relies on cooking to fend off her woes. When Julie sees the success and apparent happiness that her friend's blog has spurred, she decides to start a blog of her own. Julie will cook every recipe in her idol Julia Child's book in the period of a year. The project runs into obstacles, and Julie finds herself breaking down on the floor more than once. These cooking calamities are compounded by rising tensions between Julie and her husband, played by Chris Messina.These stories are interwoven well with Julia Child's own quest to become a great cook, and then her efforts to create a grand cookbook. Julia's verve and aplomb allow her to persevere in spite of problems with her husband's (Stanley Tucci)job, her partner's cooperation, and her book's publication.The two stories complement one another very well. Amy Adams makes Julie Powell a distinctly human, three-dimensional character, despite the fact that Julie herself isn't all that interesting. The Powell scenes work because the food looks delicious and the cooking style is fascinating to behold. Julie's scenes show the impact of Julia on the world, and open the audience's eyes to the sumptuous splendor of her dishes.Julia's scenes are a revelation. Meryl Streep embodies Julia Child; everything from the impression to the perpetual joy comes through. Tucci also does well as Mr. Child. The two make a terrific couple, and their lives make a terrific story. It's absolutely inspiring.Ultimately, the Julia Child scenes are perfect; they make for a delicious feast. The Julie Powell scenes, on the other hand, are just fine; they make for the kind of meal you'd expect from a restaurant chain: good, but not memorable.",Julie & Julia
129,darin-wissbaum,Should have just focused on Julia Child,5,23 September 2009,"Not an all around bad film and Meryl Streep made it watchable as Julia Child but it lacks. I feel this film should have just focused on Child's life from her days in Paris up to her TV cooking show and her life with her husband. Instead we get 2 films in one here with Amy Adams playing Julie Powell who is determined to make all 500 or so recipe's from Julie Childs famous, ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking,"" and creates a Blog to describe and track her progress. If the film is not showing Julie Powell in the kitchen trying to make a dish from the book it flashes back to a point in Childs life. To me this is distracting. I mean who really cares about someone trying to make 500+ recipe's from some famous cookbook? I would have rather seen more on what lead up to Julia Childs writing it. I know it is a true story but they could have done more of a service to Julia Childs life if they just focused on her. I mean how many people have heard of Julie Powell? I did not before the film and I really did not care or need to know that she managed to cook 500 dishes over one years time.",Julie & Julia

It is really fine entertainment and totally worth seeing. Perfectly cast, with people you love to watch - not just Meryl, who gives, as always, a pitch perfect performance, and Amy Adams, who is going to be around a long, long time. But also Stanley Tucci, who is wonderful, and Chris Messina, and many other minor characters who enhance the story and the movie overall. The movie intertwines the two stories really well and you get to follow both women as they develop and grow and find meaning in their lives, and accomplish their goals. It's funny, warm, and even a tiny bit inspirational. Totally enjoyable.",Julie & Julia
131,stebird,"Blogging about cooking, tasty!",8,8 January 2018,"Brought to the screen by the delightful, late Nora Ephron ""Julie & Julia"" is the story of Julie Powell's challenge to cook all the recipes in Julia Child's amazing cookbook.The film is split into two intertwining parts, the story of Julia Child and how she started in the cooking profession, set in the mid-twentieth century, and the story of Julie Powell who is obsessed with the famous cook, set in 2002-2003. Very down to earth and realistic and I loved that about the film, the contrast between a well-to-do upper class woman living in Paris, played by the marvelous Meryl Streep (who's good in everything) and a working class, down on her luck young woman living above a pizza shop in Queens, played by the promising Amy Adams, is quite eye-opening; but for all the contrasts their stories aren't too dissimilar, both women end up falling in love with cooking, the elder woman being the younger women's inspiration. ""Julie & Julia"" shows that there is hope for everyone, utilizing two very different people as its example, that regardless of who you are, where you are and what state your life is in, something positive is always around the corner, you just have to have confidence in yourself to lean out and grab it.
Cooking is the example used in the film, playing off a famous story already in existence, but anything can be applied, not just cooking!The acting is world class, a round of applause to Meryl Streep she took her acting ability to the next level with this performance, there's just no stopping the woman, despite sharing no scenes together, her quality must have rubbed off onto Amy Adams because she was outstanding also, one of the finest performances I have ever seen from her..., and a quick shout out to the supporting cast, they played their part brilliantly. Not just a soppy rom-com, this one had strength and lasting durability, an amazing film, well made, well acted and a morale that was hidden in plain sight, brilliant and would definitely watch it again.",Julie & Julia
132,Michael-70,High Hopes Dashed! The Lame Modern Story De-Bones The Solid Older One!,3,27 August 2009,"Big disappointment here. I was really looking forward to this film based on the trailers I had seen some months ago. The thought of Meryl Streep playing Julia Child with Stanley Tucci as her husband Paul was, like creamy butter spread on fresh baked French bread, a combination too delicious to pass up even though it seems so obvious in retrospect. It was much later on that I began to understand that this film was not going to be solely about Julia Child, but was going to be a combination of two stories.The first story was about Julia Child, a woman who by all rights should not have succeeded at any of the things she tried to do, but because of her indomitable spirit and tenacity and after suffering years of humiliating failure, she finally succeeded in the harshly competitive worlds of serious cookery, book publishing and television and she would change the way America looked at food and life forever. The other person in the film was Julie Powell an uninteresting little cubicle worker who wrote a blog in Queens. Let me state here very clearly, no matter how important the events, tragedies, loves, losses and happenings of your life are to you personally; that does not make them interesting for a movie audience. I don't doubt that the real Julie Powell found true solace in cooking after spending her days in a cubicle listening to tales of woe from 9/11 victim families and I certainly don't doubt that she is sincere in her love and respect for Julia Child; but what did Julie Powell really do? Cook recipes from a book that thousands and thousands of other people have already cooked? Write about it on a blog? From this they made a movie?Forgive me, the real Julia Child deserves a movie all her own. If the movie studios don't want to touch it, how about you cable channels. Come on Showtime, HBO! Julia Child really did learn to cook, really did write a great book and really did change TV and the kitchen for millions of people in America and elsewhere. She's certainly as interesting as Truman, Bernard & Doris or the wacko mother and daughter from Grey Gardens.Julie & Julia is a choppy film, every time Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci are on screen, the film is interesting and has the tangy lightness of a beurre blanc, every time Amy Adams and Chris Messina are on screen, the film falls like a flat soufflé.This is not their fault. Amy Adams and Chris Messina are both talented and attractive people, but Stanley Tucci and Meryl Streep, locations in Paris and a credible sense of history are tough acts to follow. Especially when the best they can muster is a second floor walk-up above of a pizzeria.There are a few times when Amy Adams is out with her snooty friends when the screen crackles but overall, the film stops cold whenever we cut to the modern story.The big problem is there is an attempt to compare the two lives, Julia Child and Julie Powell, and there is no comparison. Julia Child on her most dull days was more interesting than Julie Powell. I realize that may be unfair, but I am calling it the way I see it.There are a couple of good things to observe however. I am thrilled that Julie Powell decided to find in Julia Child a guru of sorts. When you consider how many people suffering from the existential angst that Julie Powell was dealing with turn to goofy New Age nitwits like Deepak Chopra or humorless cults like Scientology; please drugs and alcohol are better for you and no where near as brain numbing. Julia Child is a much better influence by far.But there is something else happening since the release of Julie & Julia that gives me huge hope for America. Since Julie & Julia hit the multiplexes, I have read that copies of Julia Child's book Mastering The Art Of French Cooking have been flying off bookstore shelves everywhere the film is playing. But that has not happened with Julie Powell's book. This confirms something I have long suspected; the American people know the real thing when they see it.",Julie & Julia
133,FilmFanatic03,An inspiring film about setting goals,7,5 November 2010,"I love this film. It has a uniqueness to it which is that it is very thought provoking and inspiring to the audience. Julie sets herself a goal to bake 524 recipes in 365 days and she writes a blog about how she gets on with it. Plus we see the story of Julia Childs early career and how she eventually became a famous cook. There was a very interesting plot narrative. We are first introduced to Julia Child in 1949 but then we flash forward to 2002 where Julie wants to do something (which is eventually write a blog about her cooking challenge) So it is basically 2 films in 1. They run parallel to each other so as we see Julia Child learning how to cook we see Julie setting herself a challenge. It makes you think that you should set yourself goals and how it could be self rewarding. The cast was brilliant, the interesting narrative structure. There was not one blasphemy (but there was 1 ""F"" word) and some sexual references. All in all a very inspiring film leaving yourself wanting to set yourself a goal and do it.",Julie & Julia
134,brownah18,the two true stories of Julia Childs and Julie Powell,7,5 January 2010,"Amy Adams (Julie Powell) and Meryl Streep (Julia Child) both are adapting to their new homes and trying to adapt to their jobs as well. Powell starts a blog on how she is going to take on some of Child's recipe's to see how many she can do and Child's challenges herself to the French cordon bleau.If your a fan of cooking you going to love this film. To go back and forth from Child's, a great cook to Powell who is testing herself by trying to cook Child's tough recipes. Once you get past an annoying voice of Child's and the winning from Powell this film is quite enjoyable to watch. Along with annoying jokes to make it more intriguing, I just look past that and enjoy the point of the film at hand which is the perfecting of cooking shown by the actors Adam's and Streep. Julie and Julia is a film of two true stories based on the lives of their characters which makes it evermore fun to watch.",Julie & Julia
135,MetalAngel,"Very entertaining and rewarding (especially because of Meryl Streep), but not precisely great...",6,28 January 2010,"Nora Ephron likes to observe how two people with different personalities meet and bond with each other, ultimately forming a relationship that we hope will transcend time. In her previous films, there is always one element which obfuscates the development of their relationship- in ""Sleepless in Seattle"" it was distance, in ""You've Got Mail"" it was clashing personalities, in ""Bewitched"" it was a witch versus a human. In her latest cinematic feat, ""Julie & Julia"" it's time and space...and like in her previous films, she manages to nuance both characters seamlessly and bind them in our eyes to a point where we can't care for one without wondering what will happen to the other. It truly is remarkable.The film is based on two true stories. First there's the story of the world-renowned Julia Child, who wrote the American classic ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" (I remember having a copy of it when I was young), and who gained her place among America's home kitchens. Well, this is the story of Julia's arrival on France in 1949, how she learned to cook and how she went about co-writing the book with two of her friends. The other story happens in 2002, and it follows Julie Powell, a government worker who lives atop a Pizzeria with her husband, and who decides that to make her life matter something she'll cook all of Julia Child's recipes in a maximum of ONE year...and she'll blog about it. The film seamlessly interweaves these two stories à la ""The Hours"", with Julia's life experiences going into her cookbook, and those experiences wafting through the years to Julie's kitchen. Food here is the joining element, and the passion and artistry which these two women attempt to reproduce in their recipes binds them poignantly, with Julia on one side learning and writing, and Julie on the other side learning from her.The film may seem, at first, unimpressive...and it isn't, to a point. It's a biopic, and we must admit that our lives are seldom as impressive as Hollywood makes them out to be, so don't be expecting ingenious plot twists or the characters coming full circle at the end. The film portrays the life of America's most beloved cook and of a woman following in her footsteps. Just that. What IS amazing, though, is how the lives of these completely different women are similar, even though they live in different centuries and countries. They're both: happily married, they both experience an important move at the beginning of the film, both take up cooking to fill up an emptiness in their life and both harvest so much passion and art from what they cook; both are writers, but find almost the same hardships when looking for publishers, both have similar marital problems, and at the end they both understand how life works for them and how cooking is important.Ephron is not a mastermind, but she knows how to relate two characters. These two women have never met, but they're so similar and share so much that we wonder whether they may be family. And notice how Julie adores and reveres Julia, even though she's never met her, and how Julia is the motivation and spark behind Julie's life even if she's not aware of her existence. They are victims of causality, and Ephron exploits this to give the film its power. Meryl Streep as Julia Child takes over what could be an uninteresting story and injects it with glee and joy with a powerful and entrancing performance, an Oscar-worthy one. Amy Adams as Julie Powell is very good too, depicting a typical struggling American woman and bearing her heart for the audience to bask in its light. Her story is a bit uninvolving too, but her performance does wonders for what could otherwise be a stale film.So...""Julie & Julia"" has two seamlessly intertwined story lines and two superbly-acted leading ladies. Alexandre Desplat's score is good, but it tries so hard to blend into the background that it actually manages to do so, goes by unnoticed and does nothing to enhance the feeling of the film. The cinematography and editing are very well done, but not spectacular. The production design is very good, actually, especially on the Julia storyline, recreating bourgeois France in 1949 and seeping us into the charming and infectiously fun lifestyle she led.Nevertheless, the big flaw of the film comes when transmitting the TRUE personalities of Julia Child and Julie Powell onto the screen. Streep and Adams do wonders with the material they've been given, but if you've read Child's letters and memoirs, and if you've read Powell's book, you'll see that there is so much more depth to their personalities than Ephron decides to give them in the film. True, if both books had been fully adapted the film would have been AGES long, but I just wish we could've been treated to more from these two intriguing ladies, who are (after all) the sole interesting thing in the film.I recommend for you to see it, especially because of Meryl Streep's virtuoso performance, but don't expect to be blown away. It's not THE biopic of the year, but it's fun enough and a rewarding viewing experience.Rating: 2 stars and a half out of 4.",Julie & Julia

Contrasting the life of Chef Julia Child,with Julie Powell, a woman who aspires to cook all 524 recipes from Child's cookbook. In 1949, Julia Child is in Paris, the wife of a diplomat, wondering how to spend her days. She tries hat making, bridge, & then cooking lessons at Cordon Bleu. There she discovers her passion. In 2002, Julie Powell, about to turn 30 & underemployed with an unpublished novel, decides to cook her way through ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" in a year & to blog about it. We go back & forth between these stories of two women learning to cook & finding success. Sympathetic, loving husbands support them both, & friendships, too, add zest. Streep is great is this role & she should/could win the Oscar this year for it. Childs is an ever fascinating character & Streep really becomes her.

Ephron adapted the script Child's posthumously published 2006 memoir (co-written with Alex Prud'homme) ""My Life in France"" & Julie Powell's entertaining, soufflé-light memoir -- from which the movie gets its name -- a recounting of the year Powell spent cooking every recipe in Child's 1961 classic ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking."" This movie is so good it should become an instant classic. I WOULD LIKE TO TRY COOKING ALL THOSE 500 recipes.. I loved the parts about her & her husband's life in Paris France in the 1940s & 1950s. The McCarthyism issue bored me. Julia Childs was fantastic & this recreation of her is also fantastic!! With passion, fearlessness & butter, anything is possible.

Julia Child is a diplomat's wife from 1949 who takes cooking lessons in French quisine. And then its Julie Powell an underemployed woman from 2002 who runs a blog about cooking on the internet.I thought the idea for this movie was wonderful, it truly feels like a breath of fresh air in comparison to the other movies I've seen lately.

138,LadyLiberty,Julie & Julia Satisfies,6,8 August 2009,"A friend of mine has been looking forward to this one for quite awhile. Though this isn't usually my kind of movie, the premise intrigued me and the actors are obviously top notch. It wasn't hard to talk me into buying a ticket.Julie and Julia plays on the similarities of two women who live two very different lives in two very different eras. The one thing, the overwhelming thing, the two women have in common is that they're both looking for something to do, something that's both fulfilling and which matters.Julia Child (Meryl Streep), the famous (and infamous) chef, finds herself living in diplomatic splendor in France in 1949 when her husband (Stanley Tucci) is sent there on a government posting. Julie (Amy Adams) works for the government in New York City in 2002. She and her husband (Chris Messina) live above a pizzeria in Queens. Julia, who is bored out of her mind as a housewife, goes to cooking school and eventually writes a cookbook. Julie, who is a frustrated writer and unhappy cubicle denizen, decides to cook every recipe in Julia Child's ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" cookbook and blog about the experience.But that overview barely scratches the surface of the story. Both women endure joy and pain, successes and setbacks. And with scenes that alternate and twine between the two disparate lives, we come to see the parallels that Julie does between her and Julia for ourselves.This may be the only movie ever based simultaneously on two true stories. The real Julie Powell really did do that cooking and write that blog (and eventually a book). The real Julia Child did write an autobiography and a cookbook that serve as references for the other half of the film. Fortunately for us, both stories are interesting in and of themselves, and the combination is very, very good indeed.The actors are all just terrific, most notably Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci who have a surprising on screen chemistry that makes the lifelong love affair between Julia and her husband Paul entirely believable. Amy Adams is also good, though her chemistry with her co-star isn't as overt and I believe takes a little something away from her scenes that might otherwise have added just the right amount of spice to them. While you might expect some times of real drama, there are also some moments of genuine comedy that make Julie & Julia a wonderfully rounded and entertaining movie experience.It should be noted that, while the appearance of office cubicles and small apartments in New York several years ago wasn't much of a stretch for set decorators, Paris in the late 1940's was, and they stepped up brilliantly. I found myself wanting to visit Paris for myself, but not just any Paris. No, I want the Paris beloved by Julia Child and depicted so beautifully in this movie! BOTTOM LINE: I was as much prepared to dislike Julie & Julia as to like it. What surprised me was just how very much I did like it. The friend I was with (another woman) really enjoyed it, too. I'd recommend it with no reservations whatsoever (though I'll caution you right now that this is probably not a movie either younger men or young children will enjoy).FAMILY SUITABILITY: Julie & Julia is rated PG-13 for ""brief strong language and some sensuality."" That's probably just about right. Little ones wouldn't like it anyway.POLITICAL NOTES: Paul Child served in Paris during the McCarthy era. McCarthy and his cohorts saw Communists behind every tree and in every office. Child and his wife felt some of the effects of that paranoia even across the Atlantic. Their experiences serve to remind us just how all encompassing and damaging such witch hunts can be. While it's important we all learn that lesson from history, we cannot afford to ignore possibilities, either. Neither Communist sympathizers then nor Jihad proponents now are everywhere, but they could be anywhere. As an aside, I must also point out here that our government is currently being overrun by those with genuine Communist and socialist bents, a threat from inside our borders that we would do well to treat with wariness at the very least. Without jumping to conclusions on any front, our freedom depends on being watchful, prudent, and sometimes proactive.

140,ddelamaide,Great recipe for a film,9,24 August 2009,"Julie & Julia is a movie about food, about love and about loving food. It is also a film about writing and publishing and the joy of success. I think it works really well, and it's hard to understand some of the reviewers' initial criticisms after seeing the movie.Meryl Streep is of course great as Julia Child, the American in Paris who truly did change the world with her cookbook. But the other part of the movie, Julie Powell cooking her way through Julia's book and blogging about it, creates about as successful a blend of stories as you can imagine.For the first time ever, the New York Times reports this morning, Mastering the Art of French Cooking will top the bestseller list next Sunday as a whole new generation of home cooks discovers Julia's masterpiece. This would not have been possible, really, without the role model played by Amy Adams, making this 40-year-old cookbook relevant for today's twenty-somethings. It proves that Julie Powell's effort always was a respectful homage, despite Julia's own criticism, to Julia's original accomplishment.And Amy Adams, proving herself once again to be the versatile actress she is, holds up her own end, and makes Julie's story, as a personal story, as uplifting as Julia's. Of course, Julie Powell's kitchen in Queens is not likely to find its way to the Smithsonian, and her impact is not of the historic nature as Julia's, but for the purposes of this movie, it turns what could have been a hagiographic biopic into an inspiring human comedy. (Credit is also due to the third genius at work in this film, screenwriter and director Nora Ephron.) Julie Powell had an extremely clever idea to cook 524 recipes in 365 days and blog about it, and her blog, from what appears of it in the film, was charmingly written with a distinctive voice. Yes, she's riding on Julia's back to success, but Julia herself owes a lot to Larousse Gastronomique and generations of French chefs. The book based on her blog is now out in a new paperback edition with the title, Julie and Julia: My Year of Cooking Dangerously.The Julia part of the movie is based on My Life in France, a totally charming memoir of the Childs' sojourn in France and Julia's discovery of food and cooking. Dan Burton recommended it to me more than a year ago and it was a true revelation. Aside from the lovely depiction of postwar Paris, the book relates the back story to so many of the recipes in Mastering, adding so much to the appreciation of these descriptions.Like so many others of my generation, I came to cooking through Mastering. I took up cooking as a hobby when I was living in Hamburg as a way to do something with my hands that was a break from reading and writing all day as a freelancer. Julia's famously foolproof recipes introduced me to so many basic techniques.Later, in Paris, I was able to go to Cordon Bleu myself -- not for the full program as Julia did, but just a single eight-week class. I took another course later at Anne Willan's Ecole de la Varenne, but always relied on Julia's original book as my touchstone for cooking.The very revolution that Julia inspired has given us thousands of cookbooks that take all of us into wonderful new ventures in nouvelle cuisine, new American, fusions and all the other exciting stuff that's happening in cooking. Julia's recipes now can seem dowdy and unhealthy. The Times article quotes so many recent purchasers of Mastering as being astonished about the amount of butter and other fat used in the recipes.That's what's so exciting about Julie Powell's contribution to the movie. She ignored all that and singlemindedly and singlehandedly made Julia relevant again. Now my neighbor is suggesting that we get together with a third couple and cook up a menu from Mastering -- a suggestion I'm sure is being repeated a thousandfold around the country.",Julie & Julia

One: the unknown government worker Julie Powell and two: one of the most popular cooks of all time, Julia Child. The Julia Child story takes place in the late 40s when she first moves to France and wants to find a French cookbook in English. In time she goes to cooking schools and starts work on her own cooking empire, including books and TV shows. In the other storyline we follow Julie Powell, who works at a help line for 9/11 victims families and other things related to the attack. All her friends have success in one way or another and she wishes she could too. She wants to become an author and she decides that she should write a blog about something to get her writings read. She decides to cook her way through Julia Child's cookbook and blog about it, which becomes a difficult task as the year goes by.Although It is technically two completely different stories, while next to each other they go together very well. They both are just starting cooking and writing and they both have problems come up from what they are trying to achieve (like having problems with their husbands, and the problems with finding people to care about there work) Not to make it sound better than it was, but I almost have to compare it to the greatest movie ever made; The Godfather part II. It may seem like a stretch when you read what the two are about but the way it is directed and edited are very similar. They both follow two generations of people that are both rising in the same ""occupation,"" showing the similarities (and slight difference) in the way that they rose.The film itself was made decently made. The directing was good but wasn't anything special but the editing and writing I thought made up for that. The acting was great, especially by Meryl Streep (but then again when isn't she) but also by Amy Adams. Some of the supporting cast was kind of weak but it didn't take too much from the film. I would suggest the film to anyone really, I think it might appeal more to women but I think many men will enjoy it too, and definitely anyone who enjoys Meryl Streep.",Julie & Julia
142,gbkmmaurstad,Cook Books and Blogs,8,1 October 2017,"1950's Paris, Julia Child (Meryl Streep) is a woman who is use to working and after moving to Europe tries to find something of interest to occupy her time while her husband is away at work. After trying a number of things she enrolls in Le Cordon Bleu and is determined not to be intimidated by her all male classmates.2000's Queens, New York, Julie Powell (Amy Adams) works in a cubicle at the Lower Manhattan Development Corp call center taking calls from the public about the rebuilding of the downed towers. Her writing career has stalled and her job is emotionally draining.Both women find their direction, but not without a bit of stumbling. Child's begins to write cookbooks and becomes one of the first TV chefs. Powell decides to cook every recipe in Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking and write a blog about it.If you enjoy cooking, you'll like this film, i.e. you'll get it, but if not you'll wonder why people thought this was such a great movie.",Julie & Julia
143,cinemaniac2002,"A Delectable, Guilt-Free Pleasure",10,24 August 2009,"From the opening scene of Julie & Julia – this film, like a Julia Child recipe for an exquisite meal, has all of the ingredients necessary for a superb cinematic experience.Food, like movies, can fuel, nourish, inspire, and motivate. Nora Ephron, a renaissance woman herself, began her career as a writer and is also a passionate cook. Given her writing and cooking chops, there was no better writer-director for this film.It goes without saying that the divine Meryl Streep is like a fine wine; she just gets better with age. Amy Adams holds her own as the writer stuck in a dead end job as she turns 30, looking for career satisfaction through a passion for cooking.The parallel lives of the women across generations and time are effectively played out to seamless perfection. The film could easily have felt disjointed – but there is never a dull moment thanks to Nora Ephron's story telling deftness.A master of the female driven genre, Ms. Ephron's film could easily be embraced by men of all ages. One of the reasons is the time honored well-known mantra, ''the way through a man's heart is through his stomach,'' which both women have a distinct appetite for exercising, to the delight of their spouses.Stanley Tucci is wonderful as the sophisticated, yet heartfelt husband who clearly loves and appreciates all that his wife is to him. It is, in fact, a lot of that love that makes it safe for Julia to express herself in her cooking. The love she has for food and creating fantastic meals is a reward that he appreciates in all of its grandeur. Their chemistry is not only entirely believable, but their quiet, sane existence together is a revelation in and of itself, given the climate of today's near continual conflict between the sexes.Despite the accomplishments of the women's men in the film: Julia Chilld's husband's U.S. Embassy cultural attaché, and Julie Powell's magazine editor husband, they are both willing to allow their wives to eventually eclipse them in a near-egoless fashion.Given the current pervasive unhealthy attitude of women toward food – the massive eating disorders and attention on body size vs. health, one of the most wonderful revelations of this film is the unabashed and unapologetic love of food and cooking that the women have, and the fact that the men in their lives neither make them feel guilty about it, nor discourage them. In fact, just the opposite takes place, as they lovingly support their spouses – relishing the fruits of their labor – meal after scrumptious meal.It is refreshing to finally see a film that celebrates women who are past their twenties, and not desperately seeking men. They neither compromise who they are, nor do they concern themselves with shadowing a man just to get and keep his attention. There is no catty, evil competitiveness that has become so prevalent in so many female driven films. It seems like all films featuring strong women these days focus on neurotic disorders associated with sex, demeaning and demoralizing them by reducing them to the objects that men still seek to acquire as trophies. All of that fodder is strikingly and refreshingly missing from Julie & Julia.By showcasing the art of writing for both characters, Ms. Ephron, as a literary success long before she became a filmmaker, has clearly expressed the importance of writing to the art of cooking. After all, most cooks would admit that there is at least one great cookbook from which they have learned and gotten inspiration from to design their culinary delicacies.As a metaphor, Julia Child knew how to handle a broken omelet - and Julie Powell learned how to fix her life by finding something she became passionate about that would also translate to her writing expression.Perhaps the film will incite a renaissance of the love of cooking and food once again for younger women, who may realize how romantic and sexy the love of food and its preparation can be.It would be a great byproduct of this film if Americans could find a healthier attitude toward food overall, with a return to the days gone by of people who focused more on the quality of the food they ate, rather than the constant calorie counting, guilt-ridden atmosphere of today - for women, especially.I cannot say enough great things about this film. It is a win-win healthy dose of love and passion that results in enormous success for all involved, without ever being degrading, gratuitous, boring or frivolous. It is a pure, long overdue deserved homage and as delicious an experience as any Julia Child recipe ever was, and still is today.Susan S. Davis is a media development and web content consultant, journalist, author, and screenwriter in the Los Angeles area.",Julie & Julia
144,dbogosian-1,Refreshing and thoroughly enjoyable,8,1 October 2009,"Julie and Julia tells two stories. The first is a biopic of famed TV chef Julia Child: how she became interested in French cooking, how she got the idea of writing a French cookbook (for English-speaking audiences), and how she overcame the obstacles in her way to achieve success.The second tells of modern-day Julie Powell, an obscure office worker who decides one day to cook all the recipes in Child's cookbook in one year, and write about it in a blog. The blog eventually goes viral and leads her to fame.Of the two, the first story is by far the better. Streep's portrayal of Child is positively spectacular; the cadences of speech, the rise and fall of the vowels are just perfect. But more than mirroring the original, she gives us insight into her character, her desire to break through gender barriers and do something important with her life, rather than basking in idle leisure. Her husband, endearingly played by Paul Tucci, is another delightful character, and their love affair has real chemistry. It was nice, by the way, for Hollywood to show a middle-aged couple really in love, as opposed to the 20-something hormonally driven variety. The settings in post-war Paris are just lovely, and the food just makes you drool (especially that first pan-fried fish)! I'd give this portion a 9/10.The Julie Powell story is a bit hollow. Yes, she writes a blog, and becomes famous through it, but ultimately when it's all over, what has she really achieved? Her success is a lot like the blog itself: ephemeral and intangible and, as the movie explicitly points out, narcissistic. There could have been more done with her character; an early scene shows her interacting with former college friends, all of whom are overachievers and fabulously successful, but later on when Julie achieves success, she never goes back to reconnect with them. Somehow I never found myself in sympathy with Julie, and I was just waiting for those segments to finish so we could go back to Julia. I'd give this portion a 6/10.The movie could well be seen as an extended commentary on the changing definition of ""publishing."" Julia Child's cookbook is a tangible, lasting legacy that will likely be around for centuries. Meanwhile, the blog was entertaining for a while, then soon forgotten. Each Julie(a) achieved fame through publication, but are they truly commensurate?",Julie & Julia
145,Whythorne,Excellent recipe for a waste of time,1,10 January 2010,"OK, folks...if you like a couple of hours listening to sucking and gurgling sounds (and that's just the scenes of Julia Childs and Julie Powell sucking face with their husbands), then you'll love this movie. I mean, please...must we? Did the sound people put tiny microphones INSIDE the mouths of the actors? If that's not bad enough, director Ephron felt she had to include as many scenes as possible with people talking with their mouths full of food, licking fingers, etc. and with every sound effect that comes with such charming actions fully amplified, so we could appreciate every nuance of greasy, lip-smacking mastication. It sounds as if foley artists covered microphones with mashed potatoes and chicken fat and then had somebody chew on them while they recorded. Anyway, just make sure you're not eating something yourself while watching this or you may want to hurl. Funny how a movie that is intended to communicate the joy of cooking can cause such a total loss of appetite.Point two. My guess is that Ephron felt her favorite cutesy actress, Meg Ryan, was too old for the part of Julie, so Amy Adams was cast instead. I can imagine what went on during filming...Ephron: ""OK, Cut! Amy, let's do that scene again. Only remember, you're suppose to do it exactly like Meg Ryan would have if she were playing the part!""Amy Adams: ""I thought I was playing this Julie Powell chick."" Ephron: ""No, you're playing Meg Ryan being in a Nora Ephron film. Look, do you want a paycheck or not?""Oh, and sorry Meryl. The entire time I was sitting through this my mind kept telling me, ""That's Meryl Streep trying very hard to come off as Julia Childs.""So, take away the gross-you-out sound effects, the ""I don't really give a damn what happens to these characters"" story lines, Meg Ryan impersonation, and what do you have left? Well, for those who like bashing anything that is not liberal enough for Hollywood's taste, there's a line where Julie Powell's boss says ""If I was a Republican you'd be fired."" Wow, I'll bet it took Ephron days before she could came up with that perfectly hilarious and witty line to satisfy her political bitterness!This movie is completely lacking in any compelling, interesting or charming ingredients. Yes, an excellent recipe for a waste of time.",Julie & Julia

There are one or two periods of very long narration by Julia which verges on annoying due to her over the top nature. Also, disappointing in the sense that the two characters never actually interact which leaves the film feeling more like two seperate films rather than one big work.",Julie & Julia

Two truly loving couples, half a century apart, celebrating their love and sensuality in the context of their respective times.Meryl Streep is phenomenal and it is impossible to say which of her roles is the best. They all seem perfect. Amy Adams is cute, genuine and appealing as always . Nice and heart worming film about creativity and meaning in people's lives. Truly 'post-feministic' theme: how un-emancipating cooking may sound and, yet, how inspiring, liberating and meaningful it becomes in their so separate, but parallel realities.

She also did a great work with the script, derived from the books written by the real Julie Powell and Julia Child.Finally This is quite a good movie boosting of another excellent performance from Streep,and good work from Adams and Tucci,along with a good story.",Julie & Julia
149,brimon28,A chick-flick? Not quite,5,22 October 2009,"Some films say: ""Don't read the book first"", others say: ""Don't eat first"". Not having read the book, but having read other posts, I'm inclined to agree that reading this book first would be a mistake. Indeed, reading it all might be a mistake. Certainly, this film might cause you to take up eating seriously, or perhaps even cooking. Uncredited in this film is its inspiration, William Wallace Irwin's The Garrulous Gourmet, published in 1947. Irwin was an American diplomat in Paris (get the connection?) who really introduced Americans to French cooking, some years before Julia Child moved with her diplomat husband to that city. This writer had the good fortune to have a lecturer in film and television school who pointed out the difference between the way Americans and the French treated food in movies. Americans are a stickler for continuity, making sure that each scene is unspoiled by filmic accidents. So food was unidentifiable, and the diminution of the food on the plate during a scene was carefully controlled. French film-makers insisted on real food, and that the actors eat it. In Julie & Julie the food is paramount. the actors obviously enjoy it. Forget the continuity! So the editor had a real job to do, and I think it's a job well done. The director had a more difficult adaption task, and if other posts are to be believed, this is another job well done. This writer's friend, a fellow cineaste, refused to view the film. ""Another chick-flick"", he said. He's wrong. Chick-flick this is not. Entertaining it is.",Julie & Julia

She had Julia down to the tee and my God I would have given anything to live her life in Paris & have access at genuine french cooking lessons. If you hate cooking this film should inspire you! They say the way to a man's heart is through his stomach and that's the truth. Both women's lives & relationships made the movie even more interesting and their recipes made it even more appealing! It was a great idea to combine both women's lives into one film & I hope Meryl win an award for this one!

151,DriftedSnowWhite,More proof that Nora Ephron was a female mysogynist.,2,5 October 2021,"I can think of no Nora Ephron female protagonist who was not portrayed as a simpleton, which is exactly how 'Julie' and 'Julia' were portrayed in this movie. (Consider dim 'Kathleen' in 'You've Got Mail' for another example).I have watched 'Julie & Julia' many times because it is one of the few DVDs I own, and because the performances of the supporting characters, (including extras), are so engaging - again, true of Ephron's other movies. Unlikable, simpleton female lead characters, and everyone else is marvelous.With tonight's viewing, I finally ""got it"" - 'Paul' doesn't like, let alone love, 'Julia' at all. She is a constant embarrassment to him, and, as directed in this movie, no one could tolerate 'Julia's' constant, ear-killing vocal intonations, nor her abject ignorance, (despite serving in the foreign service.It was rather astonishing to, at last, allow 'Paul's' tolerance of 'Julia', giving rise to thoughts that, as portrayed in this movie, 'Julia' served to cover 'Paul's' - what? Attraction to men? Needing a wife who could be ignored? There seems not even friendship shared between them - no mutual respect.One consistent takeaway from the movie is that 'Eric Powell', as portrayed here, would be the ideal husband - attributes surely exemplified by the performance of Chris Messina.But this is truly a lousy movie.On the plus side, the filming, lighting, sets, and costuming in Julie & Julia is excellent.",Julie & Julia
152,clg238,Entertaining biopics,8,15 August 2009,"When a movie is this entertaining, it's easy to overlook the flaws. Meryl Streep is sans pareil (again!). Her voice, her expressions, her body language are the embodiment of the Julia Child we recall on TV. Streep is enthralling, and when she isn't on screen, the action is lively enough to keep us hooked. The film at bottom is 2 biopics intertwined. Biopics almost never make for successful stories, and the story aspect of this film is certainly wanting. However, there is enough laugh-out-loud humor, enough charming dialogue, enough picturesque cinematography to carry the lack of plot. The casting of Stanley Tucci as Child's husband is peculiar at best. He's been wonderful in other movies, notably THE BIG NIGHT. Not for a second did I believe him in his role here (at first I thought he was supposed to be Julia's friend) or feel a shred of chemistry between him and Streep! Amy Adams is also an odd casting, especially disappointing after her terrific role in DOUBT. Here she does not emerge as anything more than petulant.

153,john-575,Disappointing and downbeat - I want my time AND money back,2,28 October 2009,"Can I first declare to being a big Meryl Streep fan.. and possibly an even bigger Amy Adams fan... I can't tell you how disappointing this film was. Next to Cheri it will go down as one of my worst movies of the year... just ahead of Tuipan and truly that was dreary.My wife and I like food themed movies... but for me not this one. I'm not familiar with the real life people Streep and Adams were meant to be portraying here. But having already wasted 2hrs of my life I'll never get back I'm not going to waste any more time looking into physical similarities, whether the apartment above the pizza shop was the actual location of the real person.... certainly it was a drab place.When the film started in France in 1949 and we see the blue 1946 or thereabouts Buick Woodie station wagon come off the boat and Streep and her on screen husband arrive in Rouen I had high hopes. But apart from the scenes where the Cordon Blue chef showed Streep how to hold a knife and cut onions and the scene where she beat the men doing this... what a dull affair.Adams friends were awful, yes Streep was made to look tall... did they employ short actors... I'll never know because in this case I don't care.Give me the German ""Mostly Martha"" some of the Italian Chocolate movies, Masterchef Australia, some of the European cooking shows. they at least are interesting. Better to have spent some money capturing the life and times of the NZ TV chef ""The Galloping Gourmet"" Graham Kerr who had a John Steed from the Avengers type of charm. Or perhaps the recently deceased Keith Floyd whose obituary suggests a rather complicated man. Give me 2hrs of Scottish TV chef Nick Nairn catching fish, hunting game and preparing it.What I'd really like to know is who was responsible for making the enchanting Amy Adams so unattractive to look at... her hair for example. In cooking parlance Streep was soufflé or pavlova... a little bit goes a long way, Adams sadly was plain flour and the whole movie was tripe.Hands up in you like the look and taste of tripe... if so you might like this. If not go at your own risk.I had thought of the best way to combine going to this movie with food. Yes we were tempted to go Gold Class where you enjoy a meal and glass of wine with the movie.After this screening we did adjourn to our holiday apartment, turned on the gas log fire and the 42"" plasma TV and prepared to cook a nice steak with a take-way salad with a very nice baslamic vinegar dressing. Some chips from the night before heated up (remember we're on holidays)and a small bottle 2007 Australian shiraz... 2007 was a wonderful year.The only flaw in my planning on this particular evening was the movie and dinner format. With the value of hindsight we should have just done the food part and been content with whatever was playing on TV.

154,Seersha1,Okay,4,8 June 2010,"I was disappointed with this movie. I guess for a movie starring Meryl Streep I was expecting something... more. I actually found it to often times be quite boring and slow, which I suppose makes sense when you think about it since there really isn't much of a plot. The movie is based on real-life events – a young woman names Julie decides to take a years of her life and cook her way through Julie Child's cookbook and blog about it on the internet. Along the way she learns more about herself through the experience. The movie also takes a look at the story of Julia Child's own journey through her cooking classes to final book publishing. Let me just say that the performances are all fine – to her credit Meryl Streep does indeed look like she's having a lot of fun with the character. And Amy Adams proves to be a versatile actress. I would never have recognized her as the girl who was in Enchanted, and that speaks highly of her talent.

155,Davor_Blazevic_1959,Cinematic treats in the story about gastronomic ones,8,10 January 2010,"Twenty years after writing her best screenplay so far, When Harry Met Sally... (movie directed by Rob Reiner), Nora Ephron has finally matched it, at least with one story in her latest attempt titled Julie & Julia. In the meantime, combining it with her writing talents, she has directed a string of movies, including her commonly most acclaimed film Sleepless in Seattle, as well as seriously under-appreciated, though oddly amusing lineup of eccentric characters, brought together in the movie Mixed Nuts, remade from its French original.Julie & Julia has immediately placed itself on top of my personal list of her self-penned directorial accomplishments. Based on two true stories, movie combines six decades separated lives of Julia Child (Meryl Streep), wife of an American diplomat (Stanley Tucci) in post-WW2 Paris, discovering her passion for French cuisine, then introducing it to American amateurs, and modern era Julie Powell (Amy Adams), professionally reduced to a hot line counselling 'cubicle girl', desperately entertaining her unfulfilled literary ambitions via blogging about her attempt to try and finish all 524 recipes from Julia Child's cookbook in 365 days.Ms. Streep's acting is great as always, this time even aided by the physical grandeur of her greater-than-life on-screen persona, undoubtedly achieved by means of never visible pair of platform shoes, providing that she's impersonating genuinely tall person, as real Julia Child apparently was. Adding to it Mr. Tucci's notable performance in his role of a diplomat and supportive husband, as well as Ms. Adams's, well, not so remarkable, but still passable performance in her role of Julie, backed by yet another understanding and supportive husband (Chris Messina), combined they present us with the movie abundant not only with gastronomic treats, but cinematic ones, as well.

I am a vegetarian but the movie makes me think that non veg won't be that bad.Something on relationshipsthe way Julia feels when her sister is pregnant and she can't have child or how mother of Juli's supports here finally.

157,ken1848,Move Thee Reviews: A Chocolate Pie Giving You a Good Appetite,8,21 November 2009,"I watched Julie and Julia because of Director of Sleepless in Seattle, Nora Ephron, and a phenomenal actress, Meryl Streep. The movie, a real feast for food lovers, is about two women who become famous because of their enthusiasm for cooking.Julie and Julia have different personalities and purposes of cooking, but both of them do possess genuine passion for cooking and courage to pursue their dreams against all odds e.g. middle age and discrimination against females. The movie encourages us to ask ourselves a question. What do you really like to do? The regimen is to do it. With a goal, determination and action taken, one will survive the hardships. Personally, I do relate myself to Julie. I have just turned 30 and the opening of her blog reminds me of the opening of Move Thee Reviews. When Julie's mum asked her who would read her blog, a flicker of a smile crossed my face since I once asked myself this question.This light-hearted and feel-good drama reminds me of several movies. The first few scenes in France make me think of Ratatouille and Julie's articles in her blog resemble the ones in Sex and the City. Like the Hours, the movie also points out the difficulties faced by female writers in the old times and the differences between two eras e.g. blogmates VS pen friends.Although Meryl Streep has a talent unmatched by most of the actresses, Amy Adams also gives a convincing performance though her character may not please everybody. Thanks to the bewitching theme song, Time after Time by Margaret Whiting, the two women are linked. The set is also beautifully crafted, capturing the mood of two different eras and cities.The movie would have been more satisfying if the linkage between Julie and Julia had been further developed. For instance, Julia's influence on Julie as well as Julie's story can be strengthened. I also find Eric's confrontation with Julie too sudden.On the whole, Julie & Julia is a tangy chocolate cream pie which can give you a good appetite.",Julie & Julia
158,JaysonT,Deliciously light entertainment!,7,7 August 2009,"Biopics are hard to sit through if you're tired of seeing drug addicts, hookers and mafia types mingle their way to fame and fortune. Luckily ""Julie & Julia"" is light entertainment that isn't about any of these things.Amy Adams is Julie Powell, an underachieving nobody who moves to Queens with her husband in a small apartment above a pizzeria. Every day she sits at her cubicle coping with callers who are still sick with 9-11 trauma. While her more successful girlfriends are all VPs of their companies, Powell is a minute insect who longs to be someone at the age of thirty. Can we blame her? She's impending on a mid-life crisis and is stuck with a husband whose more dull then a stack of nails.One night she decides she does have a talent- she can throw down in the kitchen like nobody's business. And the food she prepares is yummy and good! So she decides to blog about her cooking all 500+ recipes in ""The Art of French Cooking"" from Julia Child, the famous renown chef and Television personality. Adams, who has found a knack for her films roles (she's Australian but sounds perfectly Midwestern) falls right into home with her whiny character.Enter Meryl Streep, who plays Julia Child. Director Nora Ephran (""Sleepless in Seattle"") has merged these two women's stories together, and as Adams' storyline unfolds, so does Streep's. The Julia Child storyline is more fun, as we embark on a journey to see how Ms. Child came to be the robust, lively and 6'2 legend that she will remain today. Streep has the gusto to play her to, though sometimes her uncanny accent goes a little over the top (""Ohhhhh yessss, I knoowwww""). Still, there's a lot to like in the performances, contrived from Streep like a Saturday Night Live sketch with more stuffing, and plenty of imminent chemistry with co-star Stanley Tucci, as her patient husband.""Julie & Julia"" is a fun time in the theater (and it makes you hungry), but what lacks from this two-character tale is tension and plot. What really happens? Julie has a few meltdowns in the kitchen and keeps dropping her boneless chicken on the floor. Julia can't pass the exams to get her cooking certificate? Where's the savage villain? Where's the subplot involving Child and her distaste of Powell later on when she found out about the blog? Now THAT would be something to boost the structure of the plot. There's never a dull moment in the movie (except maybe in the final fourth), but there certainly was room for MORE concise paranoia in which we could see the two women really tackle their issues. Another critic made a good point about the Adams character- where's her supportive gay work friend? Is her bland husband the only source she has to lean upon- and feed? Streep lost the Oscar for Best Actress last year to Kate Winslet in ""The Reader"". While I highly supported a win for Streep in ""Doubt"", there was no 'doubt' Winslet was past due for her subversive work in Daldry's masterpiece. However, is ""Julie & Julia"" really going to win Streep her third Oscar? She's charming as Julia Child, and nails the characterization- but there isn't a scene that truly depicts her as a woman (minus perhaps the breakdown in the kitchen, but that's nothing to hoohah about). A tasty morsel that's best described as a prominent appetizer.FINAL GRADE: B-",Julie & Julia
159,wordsmith_57,Cooking Up Great Cinema,9,25 August 2009,"Meryl Streep is always a draw for me, and the previews had me anticipating the movie. Finally, a plot not involving comic book heroes! Julia Child is an icon--of sorts. If the whole movie had just focused on her it would have been perfect. Streep captures Child's charming,effervescent personality without parody. Her chemistry with Stanley Tucci as husband Paul is enchanting. The Child portions takes us back to France and the time period through mannerisms, clothing, ambiance. I was transported by the script, the fabulous acting, and the great editing.As for the Julie part. If that had been a movie on its own. I probably would have waited for the DVD and then maybe skipped it. If Nora Ephron meant to show the juxtaposition between yesteryear and the two women, she most certainly achieved it. Julie Powell comes off as insecure and whiny when compared to Julia's approach of embracing life, be it good or bad. Julia wrote a cookbook, taking several years to do so, because it needed to be done and it was recognized for what it was-genius. Julie, is inspired by Julia, yet one gets the feeling food and cooking are a means of achieving something--a tension release, a means to fame, unlike Julia who had a true passion for food. Julia's rapture for food as she shopped and visited with all the merchants reminded me of an artist at work, preparing the canvas and relishing her skills. Julie, on the other hand, gave the impression of tackling a task, climbing the mountain because it is there, so to speak. Where is the appreciation? the savoring? the meaning? It would be interesting to explore the reasons behind Julia Child's lack of embrace for Julie Powell's blog. As a whole the movie is delightful, and go if you haven't. The Julia portion is the backbone of the movie and the Julie portion adds moments, yet is the weaker portion. I do want to mention how much Chris Messina added to the concept of supporting husband with reality. I look forward to the DVD, in hopes of featurettes.",Julie & Julia
160,dfarhie-1,"Great story, even greater Meryl!",9,8 August 2009,"First of all, I have been big fan of Julia Child ever since I sat in front of the old black/white set tuned to the local PBS Channel in Orlando Florida to watch The French Chef, and on and on till Dinner at Julias many years later. I had the good fortune to meet this wonderful lady at a book signing in Houston, Texas at the Alabama Book Stop. I brought all my previously purchased books and bought two new ones for her to sign. She and Paul signed all my JC cookbooks. I treasure them to this day.I'll be quite honest with you, I went to see Julie and Julia with a modicum of hesitation because the trailers on TV were showing the extreme Julia not the real movie Julia. Meryl Streep's performance as the revered gastronomic giant (no pun intended!)was flawless. I closed my eyes a few times and listened to her inflection and I felt Julia was on the screen. Stanley Tucci was great as Paul Child, the diplomat husband who loved Julia with an adolescent playful puppy love quality, but always a husband, never a doormat. I was pleased to leave the theater knowing more about Julia than I thought I did. Amy Adams and Chris Messina were good, but I found myself urging the movie forward thru their scenes so I could soak up more Meryl, like a yeast roll and a good dark rioux. And I began to wonder, why does this guy who went from eating everyday young married food to a year of rich haute cuisine(with oodles of beautiful, bubbly buttah) not gain a pound, not an ounce! I kept expecting a belly to blossom on Chris, which would have been a nice bit of comic relief, but not even a pudge.Hoping for an Oscar nod for Meryl..DON'T BUTTER YOUR POPCORN DEAR FANS... you'll get plenty in the show.",Julie & Julia
161,aefrench,This was an interesting film,7,12 April 2010,"""Julie and Julia"" is not one story, but two stories. The first story centers around Julia Child, the legendary chef who taught millions about French cooking. In 1949, she and her husband, Paul, arrive in Paris to live for a few years because Paul works for the U.S. Government. Julia decides she wants to learn how to cook, so she enrolls at a culinary school and shows a talent in preparing food. Over time, she becomes a respected chef and is asked by two women to help in preparing a book on French cuisine. The result of this collaboration is a mammoth book filled with French recipes. It is titled ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking,"" and becomes a highly regarded cookbook.The second story is about Julie Powell. It begins in New York in 2002, with Julie stuck in a job she hates. Her goal is to become a writer, and she laments the fact that the novel she wrote was never published. Her husband suggests that she write a blog, which means her words would be published instantly on the Internet. Julie goes ahead with the idea and decides to use the blog to issue a challenge to herself: For the next 365 days, she will blog about cooking, using 524 recipes from Julia Child's book in that time, and she works to finish what she started (which is something she admittedly has trouble doing).Meryl Streep does not disappoint as Julia Child. As good as Streep's acting is, it is amazing how she sounds like Julia. Amy Adams gives an enjoyable performance as Julie Powell. Both protagonists are interesting, and that word can also be applied to their stories. Stanley Tucci and Chris Messina also deserve praise as Paul and Eric, the supportive husbands of Julia and Julie, respectively. Overall, this was a good film, and I recommend it.",Julie & Julia
162,KnowOne1988,Mrs. Doubtfire in the kitchen,5,18 December 2009,"It's hard for me to give a Meryl Streep film such a low rating because i truly love her. There were a couple of reasons this film was a let down to me: The pacing of the film was slow and did a poor job keeping me fully engaged. Also Amy Admas is adorable but she can't hold a candel next to Meryl Streep. I almost wish this movie was dedicated 100% to the cooking legened instead of being shared with the blogger, because it was all the scenes with Amy Adam that slowed the film down. It is just a hard transition to go from this old woman who is conquering the world because she is so full of life, to this winny, egocentric, blogger who is in her apartment all day.",Julie & Julia
163,anarresa,Adorable,7,7 August 2009,"I was a little nervous about the plot of the film. Would it be a generic romantic comedy or a dull pre-mid-life crisis drama? In the end I couldn't resist Meryl Streep's preview portrayal of Julia Child so I gave it a shot. I think it came out incredibly fun, adorable and sweet. That makes it sound like a very girly movie, but that's mostly my view, the whole audience, male and female, chuckled throughout. It's quasi-biographical with an emphasis on comedy and love of food. It was fairly well put together also, the actors were well-suited to their roles and the food realistically prepared and thoroughly enjoyed. The parallels between Julia Child's flashbacks and Julie's life were a bit heavy-handed but it worked for this particular film because the segments of each were so long. I'm sure there is only a hint of ""true story"" since the movie was based on books that were based on reality, so don't go looking for a detailed biography. If you were intrigued by the previews you will enjoy the movie.",Julie & Julia
164,jshoaf,"Butter, Butter, Butter, and Time",10,23 August 2009,"I decided to write on this movie because, unlike most of those whose reviews I have read, I really enjoyed BOTH parts of the movie.Yes, the Julia-and-Paul-in-Paris segments are over-the-top wonderful. They are superbly acted, funny, delightful, full of mouthwatering food and wonderful eccentric women in hats--and they present a romance of mythical proportions. Streep as Child is a double goddess, and Stanley Tucci stands tall as a man whose various disappointments in life fade beside his satisfaction in his wife.But I thought the Julie-and-Eric-in-Queens sections made a good contrast. Instead of ebullient postwar Paris and beloved colleagues and ""penpals,"" you get sad, litigious New Yorkers and the somewhat dismal options open to a smart, educated, idealistic young couple living hand to mouth on two jobs. At the beginning you get some classic Ephron satire, but pretty soon the story focuses on food and love. Julie's life turns out to include friends who appreciate both. The modern folk aren't so witty, so ironic as the Paris group, though. They deal in compromises and sincerity. Julie is resigned to seeing herself as a bitch, rather than a goddess, and Eric pleads not to be called a saint. But Julie accomplishes in one year what Julia needs more than eight years to do: get a book contract. Everything is faster, cooler, sadder and yet less potentially tragic in Queens than in the Childs' kitchens. This contrast was what made the glorious Child sections work. Myth and grimy reality.Amy Adams was perfect. She gave Julie a depth and believability--the depth of shallowness, maybe, but still a touching quality.",Julie & Julia
165,beccad90,Pleases the Pallate and Funny Bone,8,8 August 2009,"As a movie after my own heart--and cravings--I thoroughly enjoyed this cinematic treat (Pun gladly intended). Meryl Streep is a winner as Julia Child and does her a world of good. She gets Child down to a T, all the way down to her funny little voice and height, which gained many, many laughs from the audience. Amy Adams, though not as sizzling as Streep, is a pleasure to watch as Julie Powell, a frustrated secretary and writer, who challenges herself to cook all 520 recipes in Child's famous ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking."" Adams, who earned my attention in ""Taladega Knights"" and ""Enchanted"" is a delight to watch on screen, though her character is a bit anal at times. The plot is as rich and enticing as a delicatessen dessert (Get used to it, there's a lot of food analogies in this review) and makes you laugh at times. Many, many times. Oh, and don't watch this on an empty stomach. I'm craaaaaving that raspberry creme Powell makes to accompany a SAVORY beef stew...you see what I mean? Food, food everywhere and not one bite to eat!",Julie & Julia
166,papacorn,A Movie with Good Taste,10,1 October 2009,"I can't compare the movie to the book because I didn't read the book and have never looked at the blog. Normally I don't like tactic of interspersing flashbacks in time with a present day story line, but it worked well in this case. My most favorite part of this movie was the sense I had of being as close to physically ""in"" the movie as possible. It somehow felt like I was in a nearby room just watching everything transpire. It was the first time I've experienced this kind of sensation. Meryl Streep as Julia Child did recreate her personality well. I've seen Julia Child on television and felt she captured her presence though she is not nearly as tall as Ms. Child was. The acting in the movie was so natural that, as I mentioned, it seemed very real. Special kudos to casting. I loved the sets and overall this was excellent work from costuming and set work. The ending was especially pleasing, something I won't reveal. This is one of the most easygoing, relaxing movies I've ever attended. I plan on seeing it again.",Julie & Julia
167,vvoghen-55347,Hard to stay awake,4,3 September 2021,"I had great expectations about this movie, but the Julie story is so pathetic, and the movie itself is so boring and slow-paced that I couldn't even finish to watch it.",Julie & Julia
168,Unlimitedmovies,More Julia And Less Julie Would Have Been The Perfect Recipe For This Movie,9,15 August 2009,"I have seen Julie and Julia four times since it came out. I liked the movie a lot and gave it nine stars. The nine stars are primarily for Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci for their wonderful performances as Julia and Paul Child. I adored watching their life unfold in 1940's Paris. How I wish I could have been a young person in that era in Paris. It was wonderful to watch Julia cook and learn at the Cordon Bleu and go to the French markets to buy food. I so wish that Nora Ephron had taken Julia Child's book, ""My Life In Paris"" and made it into a movie. The Julie Powell portion of the movie was uncomfortable and I found myself wishing for more Julia and no Julie. Amy Adams just didn't have it as Julie Powell and her whiny character was painful to watch. One of my favorite parts of the movie is Julia with her sister at the restaurant with Paul. A treasure and a joy. I highly advise everyone to read ""My Life In Paris"" if you liked this movie.",Julie & Julia
169,KristenM90,What's for dinner?,8,9 August 2009,"What is for dinner? That seems to be a constant question in this film. A feast for the eyes, it's hard not to love Julie & Julia from first taste. An inspirational film that will have you loving, laughing, cooking and possibly even blogging again. Indeed, it is sure to put the spark back in anyone's life, rekindling an old passion. Because not only is this movie about food (and what food!) but it's about passion. Because, of course, what else could drive a woman to spend 8 years of her life on a cookbook but passion? The lovely personality of such a passionate woman as Julia Child is embodied perfectly by the always en pointe Meryl Streep. A performance sure to be emulated, worshiped and appreciated for years, Meryl makes this film. Not to be outdone, the enigmatic Stanley Tucci plays the butter to her bread, her life's breath, so absolutely perfectly you learn to love Paul Child as much as Julia did by the end of the film. The screen chemistry of Stanley and Meryl is perfection, and makes the scenes they share an absolute delight.The scenes set in the past are positively flawless. From the costumes, to the mannerisms of the actors, you feel transported to the forties and you feel sad when you have to leave for the present, post 9/11 New York in 2002. However, the scenes set in the present are almost as perfect, and provide almost as much delight. Amy Adams is a great fit for the character Julie Powell, with a quirkiness and neurotic quality that makes this time travel transportation worthwhile. I have to admit I'd be pretty annoyed if I had to sit through an entire film involving flashbacks, which I usually dislike, and the main characters were exactly the same. While we see Julia almost always composed, Julie is prone to meltdowns when her cake falls and her eggs don't poach. The juxtaposition is orchestrated wonderfully, and you end up loving them both.The problem I had was Amy Adams' performance. She was great, as I already stated, but for some reason I feel that the performance was not at a level that matched the others. She seemed, at times, half in and half out of her character. However, when Amy is on, she is on, no question.I also feel that certain plot elements could have been explored a little further. It's clear to a keen observer of the film that Julia Child is somehow unable to have children, as Merryl does a great job of throwing forlorn looks at babies in buggies as they walk down the street, and trying her best to not break down completely when her sister becomes pregnant, however, possibly, those younger viewers would not completely understand this. Also, the ending seemed a bit disappointing. Yes, Julia got her book published, and Julie finished her blog, but there was a plot thread that seemed to run away with the filmmakers. About twenty minutes before the end of the film, Julie is informed by a journalist covering Mrs. Child's 90th birthday that Julia is less than impressed by Julie and her blog. Now, after this devastation, as the whole film was leading up to some confirmation that Julie had done Julia proud, you'd expect a meeting, a phone call, or a letter from Julia herself explaining herself, or stating that it was a misunderstanding and she loved the blog, but no such correspondence occurs. You're left feeling, dare I say it, a little miffed at Julia. The Julia Child should not be submitted to this kind of disdain by viewers. I'm sure this plot device left some viewers leaving the theater with a less than favorable opinion of Julia, since this is based on a true story. I would have appreciated some sort of closure on the plot thread, instead of letting it hang in the air.You will leave Julie & Julia, hopefully, feeling inspired. Inspired to write, inspired to cook, inspired to eat, or just inspired to love the simple things in life, like duck confit and strawberry Bavarian cream. Embrace Julie & Julia, for both it's flaws and it's perfection, and Bon Apetit!",Julie & Julia
170,Acolin_f,The Ugly Truth about Julie & Julia,8,30 August 2009,"The Ugly Truth about Julie & Julia The Ugly Truth, as Gerald Butler tells us in the movie of the same name is that nobody wants to f**k a woman who dresses for comfort and efficiency. This caveman wisdom, and other harsh realities of the dating scene, are the core of this enjoyable chick flick.The obvious plot revolves around a gorgeous Katherine Heigl, who for some strange reason, is not gunning for the most handsome successful man she can land, except for her face in the lap (literally) of the sexy and hunky surgeon next door. Instead, she is intrigued and tormented by Butler's sophomoric Man Show TV personality. They inevitably get together in the end, but along the way, he manages to educate a smart, sexy and successful TV producer (Heigl) of his wisdom and foresight in all things related to man and women and dating. As if.As if girls at age three don't already know that their looks are important. As if girls at thirteen don't already know that boys are excited more about having sex with them than they are about them. As if a smart, sexy and successful blonde would have any trouble getting the hunky surgeon next door interested in her.With over 30 movies already to her credit, most notably Judd Apatow's Knocked Up with Seth Rogan, actress Heigl seems poised to capture the American ""sweetheart next-door"" void so aptly filled by Meg Ryan and Sally Fields.Scruffy Scot Butler (P.S. I Love You) also seems poised for larger roles, though the pair never generate the heat of classic on-screen pairings such as Tom Hanks and Ryan, Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn.Nowhere in this movie is the implicit sexual tension that roiled the black and white classics. We don't have passionate couples held apart by thin bed sheets. We don't have headstrong women swimming, perhaps naked, in the middle of the night with men. Instead, we are left with the pithy lines that count as humor these days: Heigl: My cat stepped on the remote. Butler: Well, be sure to thank your pussy for me.This movie is a mindless, but entertaining, dumbing down of what women need to do to catch and hold man's basic desires.In stark contrast to The Ugly Truth are the roles portrayed by both sexes in Nora Ephron's Julie & Julia. Ephron writes romantic comedies, such as You've Got Mail, Sleepless in Seattle, and When Harry Met Sally.In yet another awesome performance by the incredible Meryl Streep (and Amy Adams, both in the wonderful Doubt), we see not just how intelligent, charming and beguiling real, full grown, adult women can be, but also how strong, sensitive, and supportive their real life husbands are. The movie builds from the real life insights of Julie Powell (http://blogs.salon.com/0001399/2002/08/25.html).The Ugly Truth shows that to catch a guy's fancy, women need to be sharp, sexy and a bit coy. Julie & Julia shows that to have an honest-to-god real relationship with an honest-to-god real man, women need to be kind, intelligent, thoughtful, honest and open.Don't have a relationship yet? Then by all means, go see The Ugly Truth. It is a funny, entertaining date flick. Already got a relationship? One where somebody does the cooking, or has ambitions? Then go see Julie & Julia. The first is a fantasy where gorgeous blonds can't get the attention of hunky doctors. The second is two true stories welded together with honesty, compassion, influences of the outside world and true honest-to-god commitments.One last thing must be mentioned. There are not one, not two, not three, not four, but dozens, yes dozens, of instances where the square black chunk of the boom mike can be seen floating down into scene! It seems to happen most often in mid range one-one dialog scenes, such when Tucci and Streep are conversing on a couch. It is simply amazing that such glaring faux pas could make it out of the can into public view. I really hope the ""preview"" version I saw two weeks before the opening is corrected before its mass distribution.",Julie & Julia

I'm all about action, sci-fi and horror. I only watched this house while I was pet sitting and there was absolutely nothing on. Anyway, here goes: Meryl Streep as Julia was good. I never have anything bad to say about Meryl; she really is a talented actress and brought Julia to life. If this movie was just ""Julia"" without the ""Julie"" I probably would have liked it better, but...I HATED Julie. OMG, SHE WAS SOOOOO ANNOYING!! Amy Adams as Julie was just an attention-starved, lazy cry-baby. ""WAAAH! I NEVER FINISH ANYTHING!!"" That's just because you're a lazy a$$hole. Maybe if she were cooking for a different reason, I'd like her better, but all she does is complain and whine. Also, I HAVE NO IDEA WHY HER HUSBAND LOVES HER. If I were her husband, I'd probably throw her out of the apartment. I don't know how he puts up with her.So yeah, I hate Julie but JuliA is good.

173,claudiaeilcinema,Two kitchens,6,20 August 2009,"Nora Ephron's terrible miscalculation doesn't spoil things completely but it certainly hurts what it could have been, one of the best films of the year with a superlative performance by Meryl Streep. The performance more than survives, thank God, because I believe in years to come it will be considered one of Meryl's best. Imagine that! I loved her! Her Julia Child is total, complete, overwhelming, enchanting, inspiring. A woman of her day that was way, way ahead, in every department. A woman who was capable of love in the most direct and powerful way. She even loved the French for all the right reasons. When the films moves away from her the film suffers, terribly. The modern, neurotic kitchen of the modern woman is much more ""passè"" than the vintage one. In fact the vintage one is the ultra modern. But, as Billy Wilder used to say, we have to take the bitter with the sour. The film gets your gastric juices going and vindicates the power of butter in a way we hadn't seen since Last Tango In Paris.

I had never known Julia's history before seeing this movie, and I'm so glad that I know it now. I was just a young boy in the 70's, but I remember seeing her on TV. Naturally I thought she was funny to watch. Now I understand and appreciate the respect that she deserves.

175,livstrongeva,Recipe for the movie,7,25 August 2013,"I am not a cook, but man after this movie I just wanted to pop to the kitchen and make myself something yummy. Buuuut since it was the middle of the night, I had to wait till the following day.So again we are faced with the movie that encourages to find your dream, reach it and not to forget the people surrounding you. This movie shows that your hobby, a thing you love doing, can change your entire life, and against all odds, become a career. But let's get deeper into this movie's recipe.· A cup of joining ideas and people across time: this makes the simple story of cooking, the story of what could have been just Julia Child's biography or a light comedy of how Julie Powell learned how to cook, turn deeper into a story of how one activity can defy time and make people relive history and feel the connection with the past ideas. · A cup of passion: people are really passionate about what they do, what they think. Passion is the thing that drives something from small to huge, and passion is also the link, or the butter that makes everything taste better. Passion shows the real you – even if it sometimes can drive you to small meltdowns, but that's just because you care about something so deeply, you cannot take failure as an option.· A spoonful of understanding: passion, ideas, hobbies are fine, but if you're doing it alone it's not so fun and not so rewarding. You have to have some people behind you: either loving you or hating you, to push you go forward, to explore. This topic is explored through the caring husbands of the cooks, who, of course, can have their dark moments, but if the closest person believes in you, it's enough to make the world different. · Sprinkle with success and acknowledgment: yes, that is the reward, which is the need that pushes to achieve. Julie felt the need for acknowledgment, especially when she was having lunch with her so called ""friends"" who couldn't get off their phones. Success followed. Julia also wanted some acknowledgment: she was trying to find the activity to show the true her. And she did and success also followed.Mix it up – that is put some hard work into achieving what you want, put it into the oven for two hours and you will get a nice movie about two people finding the activity that makes them feel special, and with that activity making others happy as well. After all, we are all happier after a nice meal or in this case a nice movie about meals.",Julie & Julia
176,phantom_fan89,An Irresistible Recipe,8,20 November 2009,"With the sound of Nora Ephron's past two cinematic catastrophes Lucky Numbers and Bewitched still ringing Code Gigli in my ears, i was undoubtedly skeptical about her latest foray into the Romcom genre. Julie and Julia however signals a return to form for writer/director Ephron who has managed to produce one of the most charming films of the year.Julie and Julia tells two alternating tales. One involves Julia Child's rise to Culinary fame whilst the other chronicles blogger Julie Powell's mission to cook every recipe in Child's 'Mastering The Art Of French Cooking'. Although the stories are set decades apart-Child's in 1950's France and Powell's in post 9/11 New York-each woman shares a common bond of wanting to better their lives by pursuing their shared passion of food in different yet equally rewarding ways.The task of having to tell two biographical tales within the one film was not an enviable one, yet Ephron's screenplay succeeds flawlessly in interweaving the two vastly different plots. Child's exploits in France and Powell's personal and professional trials and tribulations manage to engage equally, thanks in large part to the quality of the performances.As Julia Child, Meryl Streep reminds us all that as far as actresses go, she is in a class all by herself. Streep is an early favorite to receive her sixteenth Oscar nomination for the role, and deservedly so. You can't help but fall in love with Child as Streep manages to bring to the perfect combination of wit, intelligence and poignancy to the role. Streep also manages to avoid the tendency of actors to caricature real life subjects, making the larger than life Child endearingly human.Unfortunately Amy Adams as Julie Powell succeeds less in winning the audiences affections. In fairness to Adams, the character herself admits that she can be 'self absorbed' and a 'bitch'. Her performance just seems to lack the charm necessary to help the audience forgive the character for her faults. Her emotional range never seems to stem further than a mopey/perturbed combination contributing to her performance as a whole falling somewhat flat. Relative unknown Chris Messina is quite likable, lending good support as Powell's 'saint' of a husband. Still, you can't help but question what exactly his character is getting out of a relationship in which he is constantly playing second fiddle to Julie's relatively juvenile problems. Perhaps it is more the fact that it is human nature to root for the underdog that helps Powell's story to succeed, rather than the likability of the character.The relationship between Julia and her husband Paul-played by Stanley Tucci- is far more endearing and is the underlying heartbeat of the movie. Tucci, one of the best character actors in the business, shines in a role that in the wrong hands could have been completely buried by Streep's vivacious Child. The scenes between these two masterclass actors provide some of the most humorous and touching scenes of the film.Like any good recipe, everything in Julie and Julia just seems to gel. Editor Richard Marks does a superb job of fitting together what was undoubtedly a jig saw puzzle of a film. Costume designer Anne Roth and the films make up department are exceedingly good at recreating 1950's Parisian chic couture as well as the less glamorous New York contemporary fashion. Finally Stephen Goldblatt's cinematography makes for a vibrantly colorful and fresh looking film, almost good enough to eat! Despite the film languishing slightly in the second half and a rather abrupt ending, Julie and Julia makes for thoroughly enjoyable viewing. Managing to be sweet without being corny and touching without being soppy, it's feel good viewing at it's finest. It also happens to be the film most likely to make you gain weight, so don't be surprised if you are hit with a massive attack of the munchies afterwards!

179,LuckyMatt93,"A sweet story and good for a chuckle or two, but easily forgettable",7,9 September 2009,"I went to see this film looking for a good laugh, and I wasn't disappointed. It's decently funny, and Meryl Streep really impressed me with her impersonation of Julia Child. She manages to keep Julia accessible and human; she isn't dotty or screechy in any way. I've only seen her here, but I'm sure she's great in films outside of this.One of the beefs I have with Julie and Julia though is that the plots going on aren't exactly balanced very well. At one time you're caught up and engrossed in Julia's plot and then all of a sudden you transition back to Julie's (less interesting) plot. Another thing is that it's easily forgettable. I'm sure it won't be remembered in a year or a two; it hardly does anything to distinguish itself from most other chick flicks. There's also an overabundance in sexual content, which makes it hard to recommend for parents who want to watch it with their kids.",Julie & Julia
180,nycmec,Meryl Streep,8,10 August 2009,"Ms. Streep's performance alone makes this film worthwhile--in recent years she has really shown her great talent as a comedian (Adaptation, Devil Wears Prada, this film). She has great comic timing, and always goes just far enough for the laugh, and usually not too far that it feels staged or unnatural.From the reviews I read, I was really expecting not to like the ""Julie"" half of this movie--but I was pleasantly surprised. I read both ""Julie and Julia"" and ""My Life in France"" earlier this summer, and I have to confess that I didn't love the Julie Powell book. Amy Adams really brings this character to life and makes you care about her (more so, I think than the book did). One problem with the balance in this project is that Julia Child did something really important for cooking in America, and so her story is inherently interesting. Julie Powell wrote a book. That became a movie. Add to that the fact that the heavy hitters in the film all live on the Julia side--Streep, Stanley Tucci, and a great cameo by Jane Lynch--and the deck feels fully stacked. Full credit to Amy Adams and Chris Messina, then, for making us care about the half of the film that teetered on the edge of the perfunctory.This film is all the more remarkable in that it is so rare to see a film these days that just revels in joie-de-vivre. I'm sure a lot of the rough edges of Julia's personality are smoothed over--but some of the stressful moments are there. I just felt so much affection for Streep's Julia Child in this movie--and I laughed repeatedly and heartily at her antics. A fun time at the movies--which is a rarer pleasure than it should be.",Julie & Julia
181,editor-131,somewhat missed opportunity - on film and in life,6,15 August 2009,"With the advent of this film, everyone is acknowledging the role of Julia Child in ""democratizing"" real (and gourmet, French) cooking: bringing it to ""servantless"" American homes. However, what is worrisome if not outright tragic and disastrous, is the live possibility that her influence on homemakers and others of the '60s was at most a brief detour away from the otherwise nearly unimpeded march from the over-processed, over-industrialized, ""convenience"" food system that began to take shape in the '40s and '50s and has really gained steam since the '70s. Michael Pollan's recent piece in the Sunday New York Times Magazine laments how we're ever more avid to watch cooking on TV and increasingly loath to do it at home ourselves, to the detriment of energy policy, environment, public health, humaneness to animals, local economies and small-scale food producers, and our general happiness quotient. ""Julie and Julia"" shows the genesis of Julia Child's culinary career as rooted in her truly loving to eat. Where has that love gone? Where's the love? I share it--perhaps my own resolve to teach myself to cook came when, at an early age, I was served tuna fish salad made with Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise. I resolved, as many say: If I wanted it done right, I'd have to do it myself. And so I have ever since. And I linger over not only the preparation, but the enjoyment, reading sections of the newspaper or whatever else is at hand as I eat. As I always have. (Not that I disdain the family meal as the forum for proper enjoyment of food; I just don't have family around.) But what's everybody else's problem? My own mother, who I once thought of as a decent home cook, picks up the menus and coupons of new area restaurants and waves them in my direction as if I will be interested in their crap. And increasingly buys overpackaged ""food"" such as a submarine sandwich, with each of its layers encased separately in cellophane and with its own included metal-coated cardboard microwave browning tray for some of its ""components."" What's so damn hard about using a damn toaster oven? And at least buying sub bread and fresh cold cuts? Oh, right, then you might have leftovers you have to use timely, and you might have to clean up after preparation (unless you line the oven tray with aluminum foil, greased with a little olive oil--but that--that--would be work). Well as to the film, Meryl Streep is a convincing delight as always; the tootling quality of her impression of Child almost never gets tiresome, till it's echoed by Jane Lynch. When Child and husband (underplayed nicely by Stanley Tucci) meet Dort Child (Lynch) at the train, listening to the sisters is like having a phalanx of Canada geese migrating low overhead. Or, there may be something from the Chronicles of Narnia it reminds me of, like the Dufflepuds? More to the point, that interlude, and Dort's wedding, ought to have been cut in favor of showing more of Child's TV-chef career, which is barely depicted. So much more color, character and comic mileage (and food focus) could have been gotten out of that--but the filmmakers chose instead to consider the publication of the seminal and historic Mastering the Art of of French Cooking as the culminating event in Child's life, in order that it parallel the completion of Julie Powell's (Amy Adams) blog documenting her preparing every recipe in it in the space of a year. Speaking of Adams, while she's a wonderful actress (""Enchanted""), other critics are right that here she is rather a cipher. Her alleged meltdowns? Her self-admitted bitchiness toward her oh-so-supportive husband? We wish! She's played as more nebbishy than naughty. Nora Ephron, if you ever again need to write and direct ""bitchy,"" I'm available to consult. (No, I'm no bitch, idiots; I've just known my share.) Or, Nora, collaborate with Judd Apatow, he's got it down. Child and her husband are rightly depicted as having had what, for a reserved diplomat and a frumpy, matronly companion, was a rather torrid marriage. Fortunately, unlike in ""Never Again"" and ""Something's Gotta Give,"" actual, graphic middle-aged nudity and sex was panned away from. But it was a welcome suggestion that for some people who come to love, marriage and sex later in life, there is a lustiness to the relationship born of maturity and self-knowledge. In the end, Child shares some responsibility for a failure to integrate good cooking of real food with other concerns. She insisted that flavor was the sole touchstone and that nutrition, sustainability and humaneness were rather irrelevant. Perhaps that's because she learned about food at a time and in a culture where some of those items were culturally not the issues they have become since, and here. But she stubbornly dismissed such concerns and values long past when she should and could have become a voice for them. (That said, I was gratified that Julie stabbed and boiled live lobsters with relatively little moral compunction, not withstanding a WSJ article a couple years ago that spotlighted increasing squeamishness at these tasks. ""Cruelty"" to a stray crustacean here and there pales before the massive institutional horror of our factory farms.)",Julie & Julia
182,petermcconnell,Not bad,6,20 July 2020,"Not a bad movie, the only thing that let's it down is streeps over acting, not a massive fan of hers anyway, personally think she's over rated, but putting that aside it's worth a watch",Julie & Julia
183,SusanHampson,Charming Child,7,25 October 2009,"What do you get if you blend Clarissa Dickson Wright, The Swedish Chef from The Muppet Show and a healthy dollop of joie de vivre? One Julia Child, the mildly eccentric cook played beautifully by Meryl Streep, the Chameleonic Queen of the Camera. This film is as much about the pitfalls and perils of publishing as it is about two women who just love to cook. One woman, a bored American housewife living in France, and another, a young woman also married but living a couple of generations away in humble Queens, New York. Two worlds apart, in time and space, but the film binds the two women together as easily as an egg binds flour. Julie Powell (Amy Adams) sets herself the challenge of cooking the entire contents of Julia's popular book, 'Mastering the Art of French Cooking' over the course of a year. With a full-time job and a husband it is quite a challenging task yet it serves as a welcome antidote to her stressful job. She clearly finds solace in the kitchen as she chases the blues away with a rolling pin and a pot of Boeuf Bourguignon. She decides to blog about her experience and soon she has quite a following.Part comedy, part costume drama, we see frequent flashbacks to Julia Child's life and the scenery and costumes are wonderful. The film reveals how Julia rose to fame and it makes for interesting viewing. Julia Child had such a presence and clearly a good heart lighting up the lives of those around her. The warmth and joy pour out of her like garlic and butter pour out of a plate of escargots. She is a joy to watch. Two-and-a-half hours in Julia Child's company will make you feel like you've been rolled in honey and dusted in sugar: a very sweet experience.",Julie & Julia
184,eandrusk,Meryl Streep & Amy Adams are Heart-warming,8,12 March 2019,"What's better than a movie about food? A movie about life that uses food as a coping mechanism? An interesting comparison between characters from very different time periods who only share one thing in common: the recipes they cook with. The film is charming and entertaining enough to watch on a lazy weekend. Would definitely watch again and again and could add this to a list of ""feel good"" movies or movies that make me hungry. That's a win-win in my book! Nothing too heavy-hearted here: an instant pick-me-up about regular life.",Julie & Julia
185,chodorov,Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci - fantastic chemistry,7,7 September 2014,"First let me clarify my rating: the Julia Child parts of this movie are a 9.5 out of 10. The Julie parts are maybe a 3 out of 10. Meryl Streep is better as Julia Child than Julia Child herself. As always, she is a pleasure to watch. So is Stanley Tucci. They are magnificent together, I can't get enough of them - sort of like the food made from Julia's recipes. Unfortunately, the story that inspired the film, that of Julie, is uninspiring and boring. Amy Adams is not my favorite actress, but she has been a lot better than this. This is definitely not one of Nora Ephron's better efforts. But maybe that is because she is trying too hard to make an uninteresting story (Julie's) into something it is not. The movie is worth watching just to see Meryl Streep being brilliant, as always. It is best on DVD, where you can choose the chapters and skip the modern scenes.",Julie & Julia
186,clytamnestra,i did not connect with either of the 2 main characters,6,12 February 2015,"This movie is based on 2 autobiographies and it very much shows: there is a severe lack of distance or humor. Julia was a bit more tolerable than Julie, but in the end i didn't really like either character.Julia is a bored upper-middle-class housewife whose first scenes in the movie boil down to 'my quirkiness makes the usually-grumpy french completely accept me, even though i am an obnoxious American speaking no french but appropriating their culture and cuisine nonetheless'. She goes on to take very expensive 'real cook' lessons, because she is no ordinary housewife but totally an actual professional cook by sheer force of wishing for it to be true. We are supposed to feel sorry for her when the owner of the cook-school looks down on her. There's a possibility for drama when her husband gets in McCarthy's crosshairs, but that plot sizzles out before it even took off. Another missed opportunity was when her sister gets pregnant and the lack of children in the Child's household.Julie has even more quirkiness in her life. For some reason hanging out with 'friends' that are portrayed as comically self-absorbed and shallow she instead longs for something to do with her life. Something that potentially salvages her failed writing-career. Enter the blog. And the luck of living in a time-period when every moderately-successful blog led to an outpour of book-offers (we get treated to a phone- parade of publishers and agents begging for an appointment). Julia seems to have thought the whole project was 'a stunt' and it's hard to disagree: obviously you can't learn how to cook from making each dish just once. And when we see Julie typing content for her blog it's all about her marriage and her lazy unfounded hero-worship for Julia instead of about food.I suppose the movie is okay enough if you want an easy chickflic to get you through the evening, but don't expect for the past-present format to have any deeper meaning, or for anyone to learn anything about themselves.",Julie & Julia

But then again, I'm glad that I was able to pause the movie and explain to my fiancé how my life mirrored Julia's. As a writer, this movie was inspirational on so many levels. The reality of maintaining a successful career while holding down a successful relationship can be difficult. This movie portrayed that perfectly. I would recommend this movie to anyone with a dream, more or less a dream in the communications profession. I grew a silent love for Julie as I learned about her plight. I am definitely purchasing this movie on DVD as a keepsake to let it serve as a reminder of how beautiful; yet difficult, following your dream can be.",Julie & Julia
188,sessedup,Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci saved this film,4,9 January 2019,"The half of this movie dedicated to the fabulous Parisian world of Julia Child and her doting husband deserve recognition. The wardrobe, setting, and food were superb! The tension seemed real; there were multidimensional portraits of all the characters in that storyline. I found myself dreading when the movie would switch back to Amy Adams' and Chris Messina's neurotic, flat marriage.
Idk why Adam's took this role. She's a great actress but the woman she played in this movie was a straight up beeyotch with very few few redeeming qualities. None of her friends, nor her husband, had any roundedness to their characters, and all she did was complain!

This is NOT a biopic of Julia Child, nor should it be. This is the story of Julie Powell and the impact Julia Child made on HER life. I don't see why that should be so difficult to understand.There are no false notes in this film. Everyone's performance was spot on. I particularly enjoyed 'Simka' and her bemused facial expressions throughout the film. Streep and Adams are professionals in the best sense of the word. Someone else here commented that Amy Adams is the Megan Ryan of today and I would have to agree. She is fresh, vulnerable, and extremely likable. I have never been much of a Meryl Streep fan, but her work here is delightful. It appeared that she enjoyed this role and I would love to find out that she did. There is a joy in her performance that is contagious.Charming and thoroughly enjoyable.",Julie & Julia
190,cliffs_of_fall,Delightful but could have been better,7,13 August 2009,"This is an enjoyable movie, a great big hug of a movie, but one wishes more risks had been taken in the service of art and believability.Amy Adams is a delightful person, pert and perky with a sweet speaking voice -- and she was completely miscast. You can't imagine her swearing like a sailor or being the least bit bitchy — and yet the script maintains that she was that way. But we don't see it on the screen. She's so fey and childlike that when she has her little ""meltdowns"" when the cooking goes awry, all you want to do is dust her off and give her a lollipop. The movie clips her talons in the service of . . . what I wonder? Oh, yeah, to give the mass market audience what it wants, a cute Meg-Ryan-like persona. Verisimilitude is sacrificed to the god of the box office. Meanwhile, a couple of Julie's woman friends ARE portrayed as bitches in small roles that, as written, are little more than caricatures.I did appreciate the Queens setting, though. Hollywood usually depicts apartments that are far too glamorous for young working people to afford; the art direction in this movie is spot on. And may I also praise the couple's wonderful little red tabby cat who just owns that role! The Tucci-Streep dynamic! One hardly ever sees unbeautiful people on screen who enjoy sex and a loving marriage the way they do. That seems pretty evolved! Then again, it's such a perfect marriage that the script must have been very much prettified. There are also some delightful scenes in a subplot involving Child's sister; the two are portrayed as paragons of sisterhood. Those scenes delighted me with their benignity but seem very much idealized in retrospect. I like movies that allow me to chew them over afterward for meaning and nuance and this foodie movie gives one very little to chew on.The Ephron touch is what got the movie made and what made the movie sugary — and in a movie about cuisine one also wants a touch of the sour, the bitter, the spiced.Overall, though, here is a movie about the grownup pursuit of happiness and few movies have dealt with this core piece of the American ethos. Despite my reservations, I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this flick.",Julie & Julia

Today I saw it after some years and I feel great!!! What a nice movie, what a sham that Nora is not present anymore! The movie is simply - of course, not that simple! - about two chefs in two different era, but I got more. It's about the pleasant simple facts in life which nowadays we forget and feel unsatisfied, frightened and insecure. By watching this movie you suddenly feel you live in a fairy tale world but much more believable. You feel how you waste you life by thinking about silly problems and concerns that most of us are making ourselves busy and disappointed everyday.No!

192,vampiremeg,Not really so good as I expected...,7,17 November 2009,"First of all, the performance of Meryl Streep is wonderful, largely because the character herself was a hilarious and cheering lady. Besides, Meryl Streep did make another break-through in her performance, since the humor, the ladyship and the ""style"" that the character exemplified in the film was something missing in the past roles of Meryl Streep.But Amy Adams did not surprise me. What she has done is to create another diligent, confident lady with a tough inner world. I don't think this role, Julia, is so good as what she had done in ""Doubt"".The film editing, however, failed to meet the requirement of the story-telling arrangement. The two ladies can be more closely associated by their kitchens and all the utensils therein, but I did not see a clever arrangement there. What I saw is a plain exchange from one scene to another, one 60s one today...and it is not interesting, definitely...The photography is not so bad, especially when it comes to the outside...The costumes are wonderful, too, especially those for Meryl Streep. But these strengths cannot make up for the weakness in the plot and the plain editing.Thus, I don't think it shall be rated over a mediocre 7.0 out of 10.",Julie & Julia

To portray someone who was such a character herself, without overdoing it was marvelous. I would have to say the editing of this film was certainly the best I've seen in a long time. Nicely done there! Switching from Julia to Julie was never hard to follow and seemed natural despite the 50 odd year timing differences. Some nice laughs and some surprisingly very tender and emotional moments without it becoming a tear jerker.

The film has so many really annoying scenes that I will give those efforts 10 eye-rolls. Just a few of these chick-flick must-have scenes: (Caution, SPOILERS)1.

Julie (Amy Adams) is a government employee working in New York City in the year following 9/11. She, her husband Eric (Chris Messina) and their cat live in an apartment above a pizza parlor. All of her friends are successful in their careers. Julie is not. Of course, we all know who Julia Child is!! Meryl Streep was a fantastic Julia Child, who started out as a bored housewife in Paris looking to fill her time and ended up being a major influence on American cuisine.One evening, while bemoaning the lack of meaning in her life, Julie picks up Julia Child's cookbook and decides to cook all 524 recipes in the book in a year, while blogging about her experience. At first, no one is interested, but as time goes by, Julie gets more and more followers of her blog.I liked the parallel stories of Julia and Julie. They had similar experiences, yet there were drastic differences. Julia's husband Paul (Stanley Tucci) was extremely encouraging of Julia's cooking, while Julie's husband was kind of a jerk!! He was not very supportive of Julie's project. Seriously, if someone was going to be cooking me delicious food for a year, I would be 100% encouraging them along every step of the way!! Julia and Paul had a beautiful residence (with a maid!!), while Julie and Eric lived in a tiny apartment.I enjoyed seeing the delicious meals both Julia and Julie prepared, especially boeuf bourguignon (YUM!!!). One of my favorite scenes in the movie was when Julia's sister Dorothy (Jane Lynch) comes to Paris to visit her. It was adorable to see two grown women squealing like little girls because they are so excited to see each other. There was quite a bit of passion in this film – passion (romantic and non-romantic) for each other and passion for food.The movie dragged a bit, with a running time of just over 2 hours – I thought some scenes could have been trimmed down a bit.Overall an enjoyable dish – go see this movie with your mom, your sister, or your best friend.

197,thechrisclarkblog,"365 Days, 524 Recipes, and Julia Child",7,11 December 2009,"Julia Child redefined American cooking, just as Meryl Streep has redefined acting. Can you imagine a woman well into middle age who takes up cooking as a hobby and turns her talent into an unmatched art? How about a woman well into middle age who is still a financially-viable thespian with more Oscar nominations than any of her male counterparts? As you can see, Julia Child and Meryl Streep have a lot more in common than you would originally suspect. Thus, it seems natural that Streep should be the one to bring such a culinary icon to life; of course, it is my belief that Streep could and should bring every character to life at least once, including the likes of James Bond and Edward Cullen. She is just that good. Unsurprisingly, she mesmerizes as this colorful character, clenching at least an Oscar nomination and thrusting herself into the lead for the big prize. The same cannot be said for Amy Adams, unfortunately, who does everything she can with Julie Powell, a character that just isn't as fascinating as someone as brilliant as Julia Child.

It still inspires me to improve myself even after several years. Julia is a government clerk. Her job is to answer hundreds of phone calls every day. Life is stagnant and boring. The only thing that makes her happy is cooking. She has a great idea: to cook famous TV chef Julia Child's 524 French cuisine recipes in 365 days. The task is not as easy as she imagines. Julia experiences difficulties, failures and almost gives up. However, she persists. Like Julie, a middle age American housewife living in Paris, she never gives up her pursuit of her dreams. Julia succeeds; she and her blog become popular. The real success of her one-year assignment is gaining self-awareness and finding out the meaning of life and love.Julie and Julia's story tells us that nothing is too late.

203,DANEMOD,"A Little Uneven, But Ultimately Worthwhile",8,29 March 2015,"I can't really improve on Danusha Goska's excellent, perceptive review, but I have an observation for all the reviewers who found the ""Julie"" sequences a bit weak: They're less interesting than the ""Julia"" sequences for a reason: Today's self-absorbed people are simply less interesting than the more outwardly-oriented people of yesteryear. Nora Ephron did what she could with what she had to work with, but 2003 and 1949 are really different planets - and one is inherently more fascinating than the other.I was extremely impressed by the end of the movie, where Julie Powell visits the Julia Child exhibit at the Smithsonian (actually a very convincing set, even to those familiar with Child's kitchen). After Powell says farewell to ""her"" Julia, seen on one of the exhibit's photographs, the camera dollies forward past the guard rope fencing the exhibit off, and a simple lighting change takes the set from museum exhibit back to 1960's Cambridge, Massachusetts. Julia and Paul Child appear, and bring their part of the story to a close. Very, very seldom do today's filmmakers use their bag of tricks as effectively as this; it's a moment that's theatrical and cinematic at the same time. It brings a terrific little movie to a graceful close - and if you're the right kind of moviegoer in the right kind of mood, a little lump to the throat.",Julie & Julia
204,AngieeeBabayy,A Delightful Saturday afternoon treat.,9,16 January 2011,"This movie is magnificent, I truly mean that. There are not a lot of great movies that come a long these days, and when one does- like this one, it's hard not to soak in every ounce of time it holds. Julie & Julia, isn't just about two different cooks in two different decades of time, it's about food, and life, and falling in love with both of them. The music, the scenes, the actors, the atmosphere the movie projects is so warmhearted, that's it's hard to believe that people actually got to live their lives this way.Amy Adams and Meryl Streep shine in their roles, especially the great Meryl Streep. She takes on Julia Child, and just works the role so well. This film certainly is one of the best biopics I have seen in a long time. So overall- this is an amazing feel-good movie, I strongly suggest picking this one up at your local store and adding it to your movie collection. You won't regret it.",Julie & Julia
205,eliz_rug,Great movie,9,1 May 2010,"I watched this movie with my 8 year old daughter and it was perfect. Luckily she missed the part about the ""stiff cock"" -- I don't want to have to explain that to her! It was great to learn so much about this woman who was a part of my household growing up. I think my dad was secretly in love with her and we had the cookbook, watched her on TV.The flash back and forth from present to past was great, and the scenes in France were wonderful. Meryl Streep was JULIA, not Meryl Streep---good to see there are still actresses who can really act.Overall just a really good, well-made film, and I recommend it to everyone.",Julie & Julia
206,axb,Mastering the art of enjoyable movie making,8,7 August 2009,"Nora Ephron's treatment of the lives of Julia Child and Julie Powell as parallel stories of self-discovery is a delight. This is not a film with a high concept like ""Benjamin Button"" or great intensity like ""The Hurt Locker"", but it largely succeeds in what it sets out to do- provide an entertaining account of two lives that were intertwined in an unusual way. We see the progress of Julia in the 1950's and '60s in mastering French cooking and then writing the first authoritative book in English on the subject, while Julie mastering the same craft using Julia's book and videos fifty years later. Both find the process confidence-boosting and providing a structure and meaning to their otherwise somewhat boring lives. The pair of Meryl Streep (as Julia) and Stanley Tucci (as her husband) are simply divine. Their rapport is genuine and they make their half of the story believable without much apparent effort. You know you are watching a great performance when the actor makes you forget about the endless hours of practice that went into making the final product you see on the screen. Amy Adams and Chris Messina do a perfectly adequate job as the Powells living in a walk-up in Queens, but their story seems a bit thin at times and somewhat improbable. I did not buy that after a full day of work a woman with no culinary training would successfully embark upon making the complex recipes in Julia Child's book ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"". Over 500 new recipes in 365 days without nearly a single disaster? Give me a break! Where did she get all the ingredients? Did she have time to go shopping every day? How did she afford all this? Who ate all the large portioned meals? Did some of the recipes taste awful? If you have tinkered in the kitchen trying out new things, you know what I am talking about. That's the fairy tale part of the movie. Regardless, Ephron makes us want to see Julie succeed in her endeavor and that is no small accomplishment.",Julie & Julia
207,gapple-3,Delightful - but the table manners!,8,8 October 2009,"This is a totally delightful, charming film. Unlike some critics I did not find it too long - on the contrary, I would have been happy if it had run another 30 minutes. Meryl Streep is, as usual, sublime. My only niggling criticism is about the gross way Julie's husband, played by Chris Messina, eats, stuffing his face and talking with his mouth full. Perhaps the real husband is like this, but it's quite disgusting to watch- a bit of dramatic licence would have been in order. At the positive end, it was terrific to see Julia/Streep wearing the same jacket in different scenes, instead of the usual approach where upmarket female characters are shown with constant changes of costume. I love Amy Adams and think she will evolve into one of our very best screen actors, but this role does not demand much of her. Streep is the star.",Julie & Julia
208,paty91,I am so hungry!,9,24 August 2009,"Let's be clear, I went to see this movie because Meryl Streep was in it, and because of that, I knew I wouldn't be disappointed. And guess what? OF COURSE I wasn't! But not just because of her, but because of the movie in general.This movie is very beautiful, the picture, the scenarios, everything was very enchanting. Amy Adams keeps coming as a surprise for me, first Doubt, then this, she's becoming really good! She does great in the character of Julie, an innocent girl with a bad job and a lot of fantasies. Her character is really inspiring. Of course, the star of the movie is Meryl Streep as Julia, she gets into character very well, but again, when doesn't she? This movie makes you hungry, and it makes you happy, because Julia makes you see everything in a bright side, she makes you want to cook! And when i found out that the director, Nora Ephron, was the same director from "" You've got mail"" and from ""When Harry met Sally"" I knew why I liked it.IF I had to say something negative about it, i will say that it was maybe a little bit long, but not enough to make you wanna stop watching it.I recommend it certainly, especially for women, but everyone will enjoy it. It is just great. Let's cook!!",Julie & Julia
209,jafonte01,Mastering the Art of Being Weak,3,31 July 2016,"This movie poses a simple question: can an audience member rally behind a spoiled protagonist? What can we tolerate? What can we ignore? What can we forgive?Norma Ephron (that's her name, right?) tests our limits in a movie replete with first world problems. Amy Adams, an elf-boy living in Queens, has a respectable mid-level job, living in her own apartment in the New York City Metro area, surrounded by her supportive friends and co-workers. Of course, having your own life and sharing it with an attractive husband who loves you (and is nauseatingly agreeable) is not enough for her. Rather, she bitches and moans about it, interspersing her temper tantrums with unprovoked emotional breakdowns. ""I'm gonna write a blog!,"" she says. Umm...okay, so do it. What's the antagonist there? Norma Ephron (that's *still* her name, right?) lets you figure that one out; she'll keep the shot on the actors seconds too long for the awkward pauses to set in. She (he?) also loves putting Julia in the center of the frame. Rules of threes, Norma! Without spoilers, let me summarize this movie with one of its quotations by Amy Adams's character: ""I'm a bitch. That's me, Sarah - I'm a bitch."" Everyone knows it. Everyone acknowledges it. Amy even knows that they know. Yet, no one has the cajones to tell Julie to take a chill pill......because no one cares (which is ironic because the whole point of this movie was that Julie would get people to care about her uneventful life). Even Julia Child called the whole thing a publicity stunt. Julie Powell, if you're reading this, there are easier ways to make friends. Go help out for a charity. Bring a dog to the dog park. Whatever it is, it's easier than getting Norma Ephron (who?) to write a movie about you crying for attention and expect people to watch it.",Julie & Julia
210,alexcuetodo,Good Comedy with Outstanding Streep,8,4 March 2010,"liked this film as much as I hated it. The first is true because of Meryl Streep's act and the latter due to several annoying details. Nonetheless, the overall result is a regular comedy that deserved more funny scenes than the few but good ones showed.Streep's personification is originally crafted making the character appealing and fun, and we could only say something less about Amy Adams' work. Naturally, I detested Chris Messina's character (or was him?) full-mouthed speaking and ever-hungry condition with his overacting performance. The directing appears careful and vivid, with many cinematic resources well used from beginning to end.The story needed a closer approach to different offered situations but the overall product can be appreciated as good with an added value due to the presence of the three main players, who combined their talent –Streep's by large- to give us an entertaining and well presented movie that at least should be the winner of its nomination.",Julie & Julia
211,johnnybritton,Satisfying comfort flick,7,5 December 2010,"Take Julie Powell's blog-to-book chronicle 'Julie and Julia: My Year of Cooking Dangerously'. Blend with Julia Child's rich memoir, 'My Life in France'. Add a generous helping of 'The Greatest Actress of Our Time'  and – voila! – you have a rich and tasty entry into the mini-genre of food movies.The big draw here is the formidable Meryl Streep, whose pitch-perfect, affectionate portrayal of the culinary doyenne is simply sensational. Warm, appealing and often heartbreaking, this is an actress at the top of her game. Expect a 16th (16th!!!) Oscar nomination. Amy Adams is as good as ever in the kind of comely and endearing role that is becoming her trademark, and the two correlating stories (Julia in 50s Paris and Julie in 2002 New York) ensure that both younger and older audiences have plenty to feast upon - a clever narrative move that ensured the film's commercial success.Most surprising is Nora Ephron's assured direction. For once managing to not serve up a steaming pile of over-cooked schmaltz (John Travolta misfire 'Michael', anyone?) Ephron here recalls the irresistible whimsy of earlier hit 'Sleepless in Seattle'. The overall result is unlikely to win a Golden Plate award, but it IS cinematic comfort food of the highest order; rich, warming and deliciously satisfying.",Julie & Julia
212,Kinoviewer,Nice and kind movie,7,18 June 2013,"""Julie & Julia"" is the movie released in 2009 that I enjoyed watching. This movie is based on two true stories. The cast is great (Meryl Streep, Amy Adams and Stanley Tucci) so is their acting. Meryl Streep is great as usual. Her talent to personalize any role she plays keeps me amazed. Amy Adams has gained a lot since one of her roles in ""Catch me if you can"" and Stanley Tucci is a good match to Meryl's character. The scenes with cooking and languages courses are hilarious. Moreover I found out this cooking book does exist with all recipes mentioned. These stories are another proof of how people succeed in their lives when they do what they are really passionate about. Enjoy watching it!",Julie & Julia
213,abidduib,Not only cooking but also way of living,9,7 May 2020,"I had some questions about life, passion, career & after watching this movie, I got many answers that I am looking for a long time. This movie teaches us that life is a long ran game and you have to nurture your passion to get some good output. Also, you have to consume 100 percent of you surrounding, I mean the foods, language, culture and friends. What a movie!! Some movies really can add values in our life and I think this is a very clean movie with a significant message. Love you both Julie & Julia!",Julie & Julia
214,crazyzubr,"Great movie, especially for cooks",8,4 January 2010,"I have to write that when Mario Batali is mentioned in the movie there was a very strong wave of laughter and comments ""...what a joke"", ""...he's not in that league"" went through the theater. I do agree. /I do not think the writers meant it to be a joke. Maybe if they had put some pine nuts on it and made up an Italian village nobody has heard of it would have worked./ Really good contrast of Julie's grungy Queens/Long Island City, NY & Julia Child's Paris. Sorry to read Julia Child thought it was opportunistic and somehow using her and her name to gain notoriety. I think it was a homage to Julia and towards the very end of the movie Julie gives a clear answer for why she went on this quest.",Julie & Julia
215,kkkathryn1019,Streep hits all the right notes in a fun biopic,8,30 December 2009,"""Julie and Julia"" intertwines the stories of two women across time and space and how they were both saved, in a way, by food. The story of Julia Child's years attending cooking school and writing her first cookbook is by far the superior one, propelled by Meryl Streep's astonishing performance of the cheery, boisterous, 6""2 Child. Streep captures the chef's voice and mannerisms remarkably; you are not watching Meryl Streep on screen, you are watching Julia Child. Streep's portrayal of her early years of marriage to American diplomat Paul (a delightful Stanley Tucci) in Paris and her struggle to ""find something to do"" in the confines of 1950's society is the reason to watch Nora Ephron's latest.Although at times enjoyable, the film could've done without the parallel story of Julie Powell (Amy Adams). Powell is a 30 year old Amherst graduate who abandoned her dream of writing, works a dead-end cubicle job, lives above a pizzeria in Queens, and has a horribly unflattering haircut. With the encouragement of her husband Eric (the very likable Chris Messina) Powell decides to plough through Julia Child's opus ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"", make 524 recipes in 365 days, and write a blog about it.Powell is self-involved, arrogant, and unlikable (she stays up all night whining to her husband after she hears Julia Child doesn't care for her blog). During the Powell parts I was just waiting to get back to Child, whose classes at the predominantly male Le Cordon Bleu in Paris and her long struggle to get a cookbook published with two other female chefs is infinitely more interesting.Although Julie is almost creepily obsessed with Julia and goes to great lengths to compare herself with her, the audience sees many notable differences between the two women. Julie is hopelessly neurotic and has a meltdown every time a recipe doesn't turn out right. Julia takes numerous moves across Europe, Paul's detainment in Washington by a government consumed with McCarthyist paranoia, the doubt of the Le Cordon Bleu's head chef, and rejection by publishers all in stride.Jane Lynch (""Glee"", ""Role Models""), has a funny turn as Julia's sister Dorothy, who is equally tall and equally enamored with eating. Mary Lynn Rajskub also appears as Julie's friend.A fun film that (despite a few sexual innuendos) can be enjoyed by the whole family. And be sure to have snacks on hand--the movie's constant shots of delectable French dishes will have your mouth watering!",Julie & Julia
216,fgold-743-259474,Every Woman's Story About Finding Meaning and Purpose in Life,7,4 September 2013,"While the characters are real and historical, Julie & Julia is a beautiful tapestry of every woman looking for deep meaning and purpose in life.Nora Ephron's homage to food, the delights of marriage, France and the art of cooking are on full display in this sweet film. Meryl Streep is in her full glory, transforming her voice, posture, inflections all embody the character of Julia Child.Amy Adams, plays Julie with a quaintness and charm of a woman unclear of her own voice or destiny. With the support of her husband, Julie embarks upon her year-long challenge to prepare over 500 of Julia Child's recipes from her famous book, ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" in 365 days.In watching every delicious frame of this film, your appetite is aroused to whip up an omelet and open a bottle of good wine. Fundamentally, the real story here is a true love story.The love story between Julia and Paul Child's is both romantic and endearing, as they navigate their way through his long diplomatic career and support each other in Julia testing each and every possible recipe. You realize that only through Paul's unending emotional and financial support of Julia, she would never have emerged as the changing force in American cooking.Today, most women are single and without the necessary financial and emotional support of a dedicated husband or partner to encourage their self-actualization. What I value most about this film is the courage of Nora Ephron to show the transformational power of a positive marriage and partnership.Bon Appetite dear Julie and Julia!",Julie & Julia
217,fifibelle,Wonderful! Charming! Don't go hungry!,9,10 July 2009,"Saw this movie at a private screening last night. What a lovely movie! Amy Adams is playing Julie -- a part that Meg Ryan used to play when she was young and adorable. Amy so is! Chris Messina as Eric, her husband, is a saint (you'll understand why I say that when you see the movie). Stanley Tucci is wonderful and you'll just love him. But nobody can top La Streep! Every time she appears on screen, the film just glows. She is amazing and you will smile every time you see Julia on screen. The only thing that might upstage Meryl is the food being cooked. I had eaten dinner before I went but was actually salivating several times during the movie. Julia Child made French food accessible and you will want to eat -- a lot afterward. Everyone was laughing a lot -- sometimes on top of lines being said, which made us miss the next few lines. This is NOT a chick flick -- I highly recommend this for people 14 and older (younger kids will probably be bored ---- silly younger kids!). I am just amazed at Meryl Streep! She's a true talent. Oh, I was happy to see Jane Lynch appear briefly. Love her! Go, go, go!",Julie & Julia
218,laurahalvorsen,Watch It For The Julia Part,6,7 January 2021,"Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci were absolutely divine in their portrayals of Julia and Paul Child. Nora Ephron was absolutely genius in including this story as part of the movie - which, in my opinion - could have been the entire movie. If you read Julie Powell's book or - even more importantly - her original and subsequent blogs, then you know that Amy Adams' portrayal of Powell was quite generous. In the movie, it's a little bit hard to figure out why Julia Child ""hates"" Julie, but not so much if you read her blogs. In real life, Julia Child wanted nothing to do with the blog/book/movie because she thought it was a ""stunt"", was turned off by Julie's vulgar language and thought she was unserious about food (as in how could such delicious food be appreciated in such a potty mouth). In the movie, we see Julie have a few breakdowns and some self-pity, but we don't see the constant profanity, drinking and political vitriol. Like others have pointed out, it's rather hard to believe that Julie Powell ACTUALLY cooked all of those recipes by herself in a year whilst working a full-time job. More likely, she tried some and just fake-blogged about the rest. Like others, I have those cookbooks. There are NO shortcuts. The ingredients are expensive and the tools/pots/pans, etc... are also expensive... and her kitchen was just too small. Do we really believe she just came across an aspic mold? Or that her husband just happened to find her a calf hoof? Nah. Don't believe it. It makes for a cute movie (based in part on what's probably a partially fictional blog), but it's STILL worth watching for how Nora Ephron pulled it together and most especially for the Julia/Paul Child part... which was truly the best part.",Julie & Julia

220,Favog,Still too much Julie,7,11 August 2009,"Saw it at a Sunday matinée in the multiplex up the street. The place was packed and we got there just in time -- the theater sold out right after we got our tickets. Seems to be a popular movie, here in DC anyway.Young married Julie Powell is a miserable cubicle-dweller whose husband encourages her to write a blog about preparing every recipe in volume one of Julia Child's ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" in the space of a year. Great premise, right? Clever story involving a young woman finding fulfillment through Julia Child, the French Chef, the first Public Television superstar? Well, I read the book and I gotta say I didn't care too much for Julie Powell, who came across as a basically unpleasant human being I'd never invite to dinner. But the premise really got to me. ""Mastering the Art..."" is the cookbook I have always turned to when I want to prepare a truly special dinner. I've had the box set of volumes one and two since the 70s, and gotta tell you they're well-used. Volume one is falling apart, in fact. (Anybody know a good book binder in DC?) So what WOULD it be like to devote a year's spare time to that wonderful instruction manual for home chefs? I wanted to have the experience without doing the work, so of course I read the book. But golly, I didn't want to read about Julie's ovaries and her girlfriends' weirdnesses and her lust for some actor and on and on with the girl talk. What a totally tiresome book it was.Anyway, I plowed through Julie and Julia thinking I'd eventually be charmed, but I wasn't. Too bad. And now comes the movie, and I'm thinking Nora Ephron will surely correct the book's biggest flaw, which was too much time (~90%) devoted to Julie's blog-slog and only a few fascinating pages devoted to Julia Child.And I was right. The movie gives the stories I'd say about equal time, which is still too much Julie/Amy Adams, and not enough Julia/Meryl Streep, but it's SO much a better mix than the book. The life of Julia Child could make a good movie on its own without all the gimmickry. But this is a perfectly entertaining movie in spite of it.Speaking of Meryl Streep, she is a marvel to behold in this movie. Her impersonation is dead on, even better than Dan Ackroyd's, which is featured prominently and hilariously in the film.""Julie and Julia"" argues that Julia Child changed the way America eats, and the more I learn about her the less I feel inclined to argue about that. The movie brings her fascinating story to life and if I had to put up with a few scenes of Julie Powell melting down, well ... so what? It's a great movie if you have been in love with Julia Child as I have for many years, and a perfectly good one if you haven't.",Julie & Julia
221,mbuchwald,too Hollywood,7,6 April 2010,"While this movie is enjoyable, watching the extras, in which the real Julie Powell is interviewed, makes it clear that Hollywood is not comfortable with real-looking women. I was disappointed that Nora Ephron would go along with this view. While Meryl Streep succeeds in replicating Julia Child's voice and mannerisms, the role of Julie Powell is given to an actress who doesn't look at all like the real Julie, in large part, I believe, because she fits the Hollywood view that younger leading ladies have to be thin. It is hard to see how the Julie Powell on the screen can be so thin after eating a year's worth of French cooking. This is not hard to see with the real Julie Powell, who by the way is also very pretty. In contrast to some other reviews I thought that the movie gave equal time to both characters, an appropriate balance for the purpose of the movie. This was not a biography of Julia Child.",Julie & Julia
222,shobhadeepthi,Bon Appetite,7,19 April 2011,"I wanted to watch every movie of Meryl Streep, since I saw her movies ""Bridges of Madison Country"" & ""The Devil Wears Prada"". This movie caught my attention when I learnt that Meryl Streep won Golden Globe award for her performance. Another movie in which both Amy Adams & Meryl Streep have acted together, and which I liked is ""Doubt"". Amazing performances by both the actors. Meryl Streep introduced Amy Adams to me, and now am fan of Amy Adams too :-).Coming to the story line, Julie is a normal woman who once tried to be a writer and failed in pursuing writing as her career. She is working for Government, hates her job. But has a wonderful patient husband who is an editor. Cooking is something that she enjoys in her otherwise boring, disappointing life. She says, ""You know what I love about cooking? I love that after a day when nothing is sure,and when I say ""nothing"" I mean nothing,you can come home and absolutely know that if you add egg yolks to chocolate and sugar and milk,it will get thick. It's such a comfort."".She is right we all seek certainty at the end of the day. And she found that through cooking and writing. She is inspired by Julia Child's book and sets herself a target to blog about 524 recipes in 365 days. She says she probably needs a deadline, ""otherwise it will be like everything else I do"".Film runs in two time periods. Julia Child's life set in 1940's in Paris and Julie Powell's Life set in the current century. This movie is based on the true stories of Julia Child and Julie Powell.This movies shows how a ordinary woman caught up in life, explores her interest in cooking and writing which changes her life. How she treats Julia as her mentor in both cooking and life though they have never met.I love the scene when Julie starts crying lying on the kitchen floor when her cooking does not happen as planned...just like a kid. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie very much.",Julie & Julia

It is a free country, but making a movie about it is an exercise in futility: aren't there any more serious or funnier topics to pick for a movie? Who cares if Julie is actually going to complete the self-imposed task? The sets are elegant, the costumes obviously competent, the acting lightly comedic, the pace quick, but the aftertaste is bitter, because it suddenly dawns on you that you will never get the two hours spent watching ""Julie and Julia' back and that you did not actually learn anything, not even to make 'canard a l'orange'.",Julie & Julia

226,l-47915,Julie and Julia,9,9 August 2018,"""You know what, I can write that, that Blog!"" says the self- confident cook Julie in the movie.Perhaps I got it wrong but it is an unforgettable line in this movie! Maybe that is why I chose to write reviews on IMDB, and I'm going to state several interesting parts or details in this review.Amy Adams acted as Julie in this movie, which caught my attention. Once upon a time she even lays on the floor and began to cry. I believe most audience who has watched this movie won't forget her as the character. This writer, this young blog writer is so lovely and funny! Anyway, the failure during the cooking happens from time to time. So is the failure in real life. And that is why we watch movies and learn from them.The movie also makes me interested in the cooking. Cooking is a demanding but requiring thing in daily life. Maybe we should try work hard on the onion-cutting like Julia (buying nearly a hundred onions and working on them only because some men in the cooking class overlooked her) .Just kidding. However, if we don't try our best to prove ourselves like Julia, we might cry ourselves somewhere and giveup. If we try and work, we may, and we will prove to others that we are the Strong one!Julia wrote a book about cooking for the Americans because she couldn't find one in English language in Paris, during which I find that she even went to Shakespeare & Company! I'm gonna wondering what Sylvia Beach (the bookshop and literature society's founder and owner) would answer her in real life. Luckily, Julia chose to write one herself with her friends, and later succeeded. I'm sure Miss Beach would be glad to put the book on her shelves in the bookshop.This movie is about two great American women in a quite marvelous way. It tells us that even though we are a normal person like Julie and Julia, we can still do something great and succeed in our life. As Grandma Moses says, life is what we make it, always has been, always will be. 
Therefore, I'm going to give it a 9!",Julie & Julia
227,wannabeanalice-1,Super Cute Julie & Julia,8,14 August 2009,"I saw this movie yesterday and I was super excited about it to come out for weeks now. Now I don't usually like female flicks. But I critique every movie. But 'Julie & Julia' I just knew was going to be a gem. I am somewhat pressed for time right now, so I will do my best to do this review thoroughly and quickly, but without further ado, my movie of the day critique on the new movie 'Julie & Julia'. So if you know anything about me, you know that I love movies, and that I also enjoy cooking. I'm a big fan of experimenting in the kitchen, and I get a huge kick out of providing food for my enormous family. So when I learned that this new movie 'Julie & Julia' was coming out I couldn't wait. 'Julie & Julia' is a documentary style film of two different women. One the famed female chef Julia Child and another less known women named Julie Powell. Julie Powell is a woman who felt as if her life was running with nothing to look forward to. She liked to come home and cook after a hard days work. So she got Julia Childs cookbook and started her own blog, while cooking through her cookbook and doing every recipe, 365 days 500 and some odd recipes. This movie is comprised of Julia Child's story based in the 1940's in Paris, and Julie Powell's story based in the 2000's. This was a wonderful story, and was extremely endearing to watch. I thought this movie was nearly perfect for what it was, a movie with a documentary story line with amazing actress's. I don't have very many criticisms for this movie, although at the end of the movie I didn't feel like it ended right, however it's a true story and that's the way the story ends. I did think that the movie was slightly too long, but not by much. However in the movie, they do cover all the essential parts worth covering. But I do have one huge optimistic thing to say about this film. Julia Child is very well known for her TV shows and breaking the boundaries in the kitchen for women chefs, and the performance by Meryl Streep was so amazingly perfect. I don't know if anybody could have pulled off a performance like that except for her. It was so amazing to watch her acting; it was so perfect it was spooky. As if I was really watching Julia Child. This movie did have another amazing tidbit in it. In one scene the Julie Powell character played by Amy Adams is watching the extremely famous SNL skit preformed by Dan Akroyd where he is portraying Julia Child, ""Save The Liver"". It was a very interesting piece to the film, to introduce that famous skit by Dan Akroyd into the movie. In Short, I loved this movie, and I might even consider buying it. It might be because I'm just a, ""Damn Girl"" or maybe it's because it's got spectacular acting, or it could be the fact that it's a movie about cooking, and I'm a huge fan of food. Whatever it might be, this movie is nearly perfect, and 100% truly fun to watch.",Julie & Julia
228,gingerliu,Julie & Julia,7,15 August 2009,"Julie & Julia is essentially two films about how passion and food can change peoples lives. Although in Julia Child's case, the bon vivant American cook with French sensibilities changed the lives of a whole nation used to eating convenience food in post war America and beyond. The other Julie of the title is Julie Powell. The only life she is changing is that of her own and she represents the vanity of everyday bloggers who are looking for instant fame and attention. Originally conceived as two separate movies, director-writer Nora Ephron decided that Julia Child's memoir, My Life in France and Julie Powell's blog memoir, Julie & Julia, didn't have enough meat to sustain a 90 minute feature on their own. This is a shame because Julia Child's other life in France is not only thrilling reading, but with Meryl Streep's performance as the passionate lover of life Julia Childs, the film is absolutely riveting and laugh out loud funny. Unfortunately, Julie Powell's life is hardly the stuff of legend and hardly changes lives. Comparing her contemporary life as an unfulfilled writer in NYC to Child's talent, hard work, and genuine need to teach others, is nothing short of insulting. Nora Ephron is no stranger to juxtaposing lives in her work in films such as You've Got Mail (1998) and Sleepless in Seattle (1993). Her trademark comic timing and direction will not disappoint Ephron fans. But my heart sank every time Ephron returns to the story of Julie Powell. Amy Adams, Streep's co-star in Doubt, fails to ignite any sympathy or even much care from audiences as her portrayal of Powell as nothing more than an under achiever who is jealous of her friends successes and embarks on a project that she at least hopes she will finish. Adams' Powell is not cooking for the greater good or writing a self-help book, she isn't even teaching herself the fine art of cuisine. But maybe this is Ephron's point all along about how blogs and the internet as a whole, validates our existence, or at least goes to prove that with as little effort as possible, a blogger's mundane life can be pitched against the life of one of the most influential people in America. How many of us rushed to write blogs on hearing of Julie Powell's book deal? How little of us want to put in the hard graft, the real work into being another Julia Child. Ephron's second and by far less interesting story of Powell makes the biggest statement of our 21st century lives. Julie Powell works as temp middle manager in a New York government office, answering calls from distraught 9/11 victims and families. The work is full time strain on her emotions. Living in Queens with her loving editor husband Eric (Chris Messina), she cooks in their tiny kitchen and uses the time as her only escape from the day. Powell is approaching thirty and is constantly aware of her unfulfilled life. Her husband suggest she start a blog about cooking and Powell, with Child's cook book in hand, Mastering the Art of French Cooking, embarks on a year long project to cook up all 524 recipes and blog about her adventure. Back in 1948, Julia Child and her husband Paul, dashingly played by Stanley Tucci, are brought to Paris because of Paul's job as a cultural attaché at the American embassy. The couple's liberal outlook and enjoyment for life and French food, give Julia a reason de'tair. Julia's hobby turns to passion after she becomes the first American to study at the Le Cordon Bleu culinary school. She meets fellow foodies, Simone Beck (Linda Emond) and Louisette Bertholle (Helen Carey) to co-write Mastering the Art of French Cooking. There's no contest as to whose life is more appealing and Streep and Tucci's chemistry, united again after their starring roles in The Devil Wears Prada, is a joy to watch.",Julie & Julia
229,cordiallimo,I have been skipping over this movie....until... i did not,10,28 April 2021,I would like to say that this movie is a clear triumph in what would be considered emotional part of life and food.Wonderfully filmed exceptional acting delivering every scene absolute superb momentum of entertainment After seeing the whole thing you will definitely feel like you got something out of it if .....at the very least an inquisition into your curiosity of how you can expand your culinary experience and devotion.Definitely a movie for husbands and wives to watch together especially for that very reluctant husband that would not have anything to do with this such as myself who at the end took the time to write this message. Because a lot of it has to do with actual life it beats out any Marvel picture any CGI etc.,Julie & Julia
230,rlaing131,Julia Child is rolling over in her grave,1,27 September 2010,"I wouldn't really consider anything below to be a spoiler, BUT, I do mention a few little issues that the main character goes through in the movie that people might not want to know about yet.First thing to get out of the way: I know that this movie has already left the theaters, but please people, if you have any respect for Julia Child, don't buy or even watch this movie and don't buy Powell's book. I knew nothing about it until after I saw it the other day. Fortunately I saw it on Netflix so no money was spent, but I still wish I had some warning. But apparently they had to wait for Child to die before they could make this movie. From what I understand, Child and her editor didn't want anything to do with this crazy woman (Powell) and didn't believe her to be sincere. I don't either and neither should you guys.Now, for the actual story and review. The movie itself was really lacking. The acting itself was alright (Streep did a pretty good job though she may have gone over the top a tiny bit), but I felt absolutely nothing for the main character Julie, other than sickness from watching her trying to steal Child's fame. It's very hard to enjoy this movie when not only does the real Powell come off as terribly insincere and just plain fake, but even the Powell portrayed in the movie does too.Below are where the possible spoilers come in: I mean, you basically have some loser with no hobbies and a dead end job claiming that she's going to make something of her life if she writes some blog and cooks a bunch of meals while pretending that she has some special connection to Julia Child. Then she gets really arrogant about it, treats her husband like dirt, wastes the little money they have to make these fancy meals, lies to skip work and throws a bunch of tantrums. Apparently you're supposed to really feel for her and hope that she makes her pathetic little goal of cooking these meals in 1 year? And all the while she keeps talking about what Julia might think of her, and how she feels like Julia is always with her, etc. During the movie they are many scenes which flash back and fourth between the two woman as they are cooking the same meal or doing some task so that you might feel some illusion that these woman are connected when they absolutely were not. Just tragic. Julia Child deserved better than to be tied up against her will with someone like Powell.",Julie & Julia
231,vogelap,Half -n- Half,6,11 August 2009,"Half great movie: Julia Child. I really enjoyed watching Streep as Child in a perfectly rendered France of 1940s. Any time Julia was on screen, she lit it up. Outstanding. Stanley Tucci did a great job in his role of Paul. This part of the movie rates a ""10"".Half really crummy movie: Julie Powell. What a whiner. Her husband was a saint to put up with her meltdowns and generally disagreeable personality. This part of the movie rates a ""3"".(Also, how is it possible that the characters in the Julie Powell segment of the movie had never seen the classic Dan Aykroyd impersonation of Julia Child on Saturday Night Live? It originally aired in 1978 and I'm fairly certain that everyone even remotely interested in food, Dan Aykroyd, Julia Child, or humor has seen it by now. Even within the context of the movie, the skits wasn't airing for the first time.)Go see it, but go for popcorn or other snacks during the Julie Powell segments.",Julie & Julia
232,goicuria,Yummy!,10,28 August 2009,"""Julie & Julia"", Nora Ephron's adaptation of Julie Powell's book is quite delightful. Meryl Streep's portrayal of Julia Child is as delicious as the recipes in Child's's first book. Streep's every gesture, inflection, and nuances are to be savored like a fine wine. Amy Adams puts in a solid performance as the bold and determined blogger. Adams brings a unique flavor of just the right mixture of sass and coyness to the role. The film maintains an excellent balance between drama, comedy, panache, and plain old good story telling. For me, it is a much-welcomed break from the usual and typical shoot 'em up, monster, superhero, action, Harry Potter, and lame comedy summer fare. This is a film done with class, intelligence, and has a great deal of charm, wit, and subtle modern-day humor and sensibilities. It may not be for your average movie goer, but for me, it is a significant notch way above the rest. Do yourself a big favor, and take your significant other to see what amounts to so much more than just a mere a ""chick flick"". Make sure you watch on a full stomach, though, as the featured dishes and cooking, combined with laughter will have your stomach growling and howling simultaneously. As Julia Child was fond of saying: Bon Apetit!",Julie & Julia
233,jillainsley,Hard to digest,4,22 March 2010,"I watched this film forearmed with the knowledge that others who had seen it loved Meryl Streep's scenes and absolutely hated Amy Adams's. That was my experience. By the midpoint of the film -- and I am aware that if the real Julie Powell is even half as self-absorbed and thin- skinned as her cinematic counterpart, she will read this comment and take to her bed for a month -- I found Amy Adams's character so irritating that I started to fast forward through her scenes. I don't blame Amy Adams. She's a fine actress. Julie Powell just isn't interesting or substantial enough to compete with a great woman like Julia Child. The snippets of blog we're shown also suggest she's not a great writer nor a particularly interesting blogger, either. Too bad the filmmakers didn't jettison the Julie Powell part of the story and just make a biopic of Julia Child, because Meryl Streep's performance is really wasted in this.",Julie & Julia
234,gholste,A cotton candy movie--pretty but completely unsatisfying,4,21 August 2010,"This movie is typical Nora Ephron fare--very prettily packaged fluff with a nice dash of nostalgia but too little substance to satisfy. The main character (Julie Powell) is cute but ultimately selfish and rather unlikeable. Honestly, are we really supposed to feel sorry for HER as she takes phone calls from people who suffered losses as a result of 9/11 who are trying to file claims for assistance? Julie is depicted as the one for whom the viewer should have empathy, and most of the callers are portrayed as whiny and obnoxious. Talk about misdirected empathy! Those people had their lives nearly destroyed and/or lost loved ones, yet she is supposed to be the object of our sympathy for having to deal with them. give me a break! As the movie progresses, sadly, Julie really doesn't. She just sets out to achieve her goal, and eventually does. No twists, no surprises, and when her husband has had it with her, the outcome of their fight has no motivation. The parts of the movie that I did enjoy were the segments focusing on Julia Child. Had the movie been entirely about her, it would have been tremendously. Meryl Streep is unbelievably good in the role of Julia Child, and Stanley Tucci is great as her husband. Also, the period look is perfect. Kudos to those responsible for those aspects of the movie. Except for the needless vulgarity that was inserted to get the PG-13 rating, I was completely charmed by the scenes that center on Julia Child and her culinary journey. Unfortunately, Julia Child is not the main character, self-centered, whiny Julie Powell is. I was actually extremely angry when the movie ended, I felt so cheated out of the time I had spent watching it. My only consolation--and it was a small one--was that I had gotten the movie from the library, so I hadn't had to pay to see this pathetic drivel. As always happens when I watch a Nora Ephron movie--Why do I keep getting suckered in by her movies?--I felt like I had consumed a bunch of empty calories...and I wished I hadn't. It was like eating a bag of rice cakes. Yuck! Never again. I don't care how cute the trailer is. I am swearing off Nora Ephron for good.",Julie & Julia
235,dblcap-1,Likes & Dislikes,8,20 April 2010,"I'm a sucker for period pieces, so the entire Julia Child side of the movie and the fact that it takes place in Europe is the selling feature for me. I have been watching Julia Child cook on TV for as long as I can remember. Her bio is intriguing and, while watching the movie, you tend to forget that it is actually Meryl Streep acting and not the real thing! Ms. Streep carries this movie -- there is no doubt about it! She has the accent and mannerisms of Ms. Child down pat! :D Stanley Tucci is fabulous as Paul Child also! :DOn the opposite end, the Julie Powell side of the movie touches my heart from the 9-11 point of view, as I was working in Manhattan at that time and I am well aware of the thought processes of most of the citizens during that time. Finding themselves, searching for meaning -- re-births galore! Her blog/challenge is totally understandable as it was also the height of the internet and the DOT com companies.I have watched this movie at least 20 times and the one major thing that I cannot stand is the character of Eric Powell -- not to be confused with the wonderful actor, Chris Messina, who portrayed him. The director/writers are to blame for his over-the-top character flaws, which Chris portrayed brilliantly! Almost too much so. What were they thinking? Why didn't the director pull him back? Being a female, she must have a dozen ankle biters, Hell's Angels biker gang, pygmies, cannibals, acid metal rock groups, hyenas and toothless hillbillies in her home at any given time because she is obviously not offended by an adult male inhaling food like a caveman and talking with his mouth full! I find this extremely disgusting, probably because Chris acts the part over the top with his gulping, yumming, groaning and mumbling with every mouthfull. He actually has the perfect lips/mouth to do it -- perfect vaccuum shaped! He could sweep a pie-eating contest hands down! LOLAlso, they cruelly made this guy out to be extremely insensitive and self-centered -- I certainly hope the real-life Eric is not that way! The scene when they just moved into their apt and Julie is unpacking the kitchen and he is batting socks with a tennis racket -- was this for real? He immediately joined the ranks of useless men worldwide.One of the most important scenes -- when Julie's distinguished dinner guest cancelled -- Eric was heartless -- right after they discussed the possibility of a $100,000 advance for a possible publishing! That is some serious bucks and all he cared about was 'more stew for us' while he continued to stuff his pie hole before leaving her! Not to mention the guest alone was a huge honor for this epic task and long-distance time-travelling relationship that Julie took on with Julia! This extremely important dinner plan falling apart -- especially after burning the dinner the night before and Julie having to call in sick to try to make it work a second time was a HUGE setback! If Eric was a supportive husband there should have been an immediate Plan B to pack up the meal, hail a cab, and take everything to Judith Jones for the interview! Even if it wasn't true, they could have made Eric out to be a better man than that! If it was true -- I would have divorced his sorry ass! LOLThey did give Eric some credit at the end when he was consoling Julie after she heard from an interviewer of Julia Child on her birthday that she was not too impressed with Julie's blog. I have to give them kudos on that scene! He was written very sweet at that point -- no food in his mouth either! LOL Finally, a year of hard work, sacrifice and revelation ends with a pilgrimage to the Smithsonian Museum in DC to see the Julia Child kitchen. But the characters only breezed through the exhibit in less than 2 minutes and, although Julie presented a pound of butter, she didn't even sign the Guest Book! This would have been a great time to go over some interesting details of Julia Child's life rather than just a single sentence at the end of the movie. The fact that they dared to end the movie with the line ""her's was made into a movie"" -- making it seem like Julie Powell's life/book was more significant than Julia Child's, is just plain annoying! Talk about disrespectful! Get over yourself, Julie! I enjoy this movie for the bio of Julia Child, the romance of Europe, the joy of cooking (no pun intended), the remembrance of 9-11, and the love and respect of great acting by Meryl Streep!Without criticizing the actors, Amy Adams and Chris Messina, I'm not too impressed with the Powells, whether the details of their stroy is true or not!",Julie & Julia
236,hrogers5,Why not just Julia?,7,19 December 2009,"Meryl Streep has done it again, her portrayal of Julia Child was indeed Spot-On and would definitely deserve any award thrown her way. However the Movie really is only good in the parts with Julia Child. The Julie part of the movie is frankly just boring and at times irritating, i found myself just waiting till they got to the next part with Meryl Streep. It seemed like two completely different movies. The part with Julia Child featured Tremendous acting talent by Meryl Streep as well as Stanley Tucci and Jane Lynch. Streep was bubbly and sweet as Julia Child .Her voice and demeanor is identical to that of the real Julia Child. Kudos to Streep for Character development. It was funny sweet and at times heart-touching. On the other hand the part with Julie was a bit of a chore to get through. The dialog and interaction between the actors was at times awkward and cheesy. Why they didn't just make a biopic about Julia Child, Ill never know. Amy Adams really tried, but her character was a bit too involved with Julia Child, frankly it was kinda creepy. In the end all people will remember from this movie will be a stellar performance by Meryl Streep and deservedly so , but the movie as a whole has some issues, primarily in the Julie parts.",Julie & Julia
237,Cliff van Ooststroom,"Nice movie, bad acting",7,8 March 2010,"I thought it was a nice movie to watch, but was disappointed by the terrible over-acting of Meryl Streep. I was never a big fan of her, but she put a Julia Childs on the big screen that seemed to be drunk all the time. I watched some old footage of Julia Child, and yes, Mrs. Streep got some characteristics right, but by overdoing them she made Julia Child seem ridiculous. And please, I hope I won't be sitting at a dinner-table with Chris Messina. Showing you like the food you're eating doesn't mean you have to eat like a Neanderthal. And for the rest of the cast: I really loved Stanley Tucci and Amy Adams. Sweet characters in a sweet movie (when you can see past the irritating achievements of Mrs. Streep and Mr. Messina).",Julie & Julia
238,jessecj,A delightful if not excellent film,9,9 August 2009,"How do you tell a 2009 film audience how Julia Child changed the world forever? How can a 2009 film audience understand (or recall) the world Julia Child changed forever? Perhaps in a few years the story of Julie Powell's blog will seem as quaint as the ubiquitous answering machine messages became in Rent, but today, it seems utterly authentic in showing how an humble home cook connects to the great Julia Child, the world she changed, and the changes she wrought.Maybe it is because my own daughter lives a few blocks from the location shown for Julie's apartment, but everything shown about Julie's life screams the truth, and makes the perfect vantage point from which to observe the story being shown about how Julia Child became who she still is.I love Meryl Streep, but in my opinion this was not on a par with most of her performances; it seemed almost a caricature, and perhaps it could only be that, precisely because Julia Child is bigger than life. This is not to fault Streep, I think she did all she could with the role, the purpose of which was not to show us Julia Child's soul, but to show us how she changed the world.Amy Adams' role was similarly limited, but she played the part believably, and with utter charm.Above all, the movie is about food, and it comes at a time when a passion for cooking great food at home connects well.I would dissent only from those who say do not go see this when you are hungry. If you eat a big meal before watching this film, you will leave hungry anyway.",Julie & Julia
239,DailyMovieGoer,so much better than Doubt,8,7 August 2009,"This was so much better than 'Doubt' (I hope she fired whomever talked her into that one). As a strong actor, she does not need to participate in gender-wars on the screen. While this is a much different role, it had depth. Very true to life, as Julie was always winging it, this was a very kind rendition and tribute to an icon. Perhaps as a reflection of the times, her previous role was embarrassing although not unexpected. Can't say that my respect for her did anything other than drop as a result, which might explain the need to do Julie&Julia to make up for it. Perhaps it might take the public some time to get over the debacle 'Doubt', I hope she finds better and stronger roles in the future.",Julie & Julia
240,celebes2,Disappointing,4,21 March 2011,"Finally decided to watch this, because I remember Julia Child well and had heard a lot about it.It's not a real bad movie, it's just not a good movie. Nora Ephron seems to have settled on a formula that might have been charming when she first started making movies, but has simply become grating. This is like a Disney movie for adults- you can see the puppeteer pulling the strings.We have what are now the Ephron standards- the ditsy blond with the unattractive ""tell it like it is"" girlfriend, the picturesque details romanticizing some slightly seedy location- instead of a houseboat, we have an apartment over a pizza parlor. We have lots of shots of Amy Adams blogging as she gazes out of the window with a sort of perky, dreamy, wistful look.The whole premise of the movie- that this girl is unfulfilled and- omigod- about to turn thirty while her obnoxious friends are rising to the heights is so ludicrous- the friends promotions so far-fetched- that it just leaves a bad taste in your mouth for the rest of the movie.The best parts of the movie are the scenes between Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci. Maybe Nora is making a generational statement here. The movie is watchable, but take out Streep and Tucci, and it would be a stinker.",Julie & Julia
241,radomski-2,No Substance,1,16 January 2012,"As I was watching this film something bothered me. I began to suspect that it was because neither of the protagonists was appealing; here were two self-absorbed women, obsessed with their pet projects and supported by bland, indulgent husbands. Now literature is full of unappealing characters, but, in good literature, the author takes on the responsibility to deal with these characters' issues and make sense of them. That doesn't happen in Julie & Julia. We just watch the protagonists go through their motions and, I guess, we're supposed to applaud them. In the case of Julia Child, I think this is the result of the way she was presented in the screenplay—and this was an injustice to her. In the case of Julie Powell, I think the self-absorption is real and, judging from her actual blog, actually worse in real life. She is a woman who sought to gain notoriety by staging a clever stunt. Well, she achieved her aim, but I'm left wondering: ""So what?"" That's not the kind of person whose life I want to spend two hours contemplating. Should we make a film about the person who came up with the idea of a ""Pet Rock""?In this film there was no character development, no depth in either the characters or the situations. I had heard of the marvels of Meryl Streep's portrayal of Julia Child. The problem was that it was all a caricature: at every moment you find yourself saying ""Oh, that was clever how she captured this or that mannerism"" or ""Oh, she's wearing large shoes to capture Julia Child's mass."" People say that the sign of a failed film score is when it draws attention to itself. I feel the same way about acting: when you find yourself noticing the cleverness of the actors rather than living the part with the character they're portraying, then I think they've failed.I felt vindicated for my negative feelings towards this film when, in the course of it, the real Julia Child expressed disapproval of Powell's stunt.Judith Jones, Julia Child's editor, stated: ""Flinging around four-letter words when cooking, isn't attractive, to me or Julia. She didn't want to endorse it. What came through on the blog was somebody who was doing it almost for the sake of a stunt. She would never really describe the end results, how delicious it was, and what she learned. Julia didn't like what she called 'the flimsies.' She didn't suffer fools, if you know what I mean."" (quoted at Wikipedia)""Flimsy"" is a good way to describe this screenplay: it has no substance. What an injustice to Julia Child! If she disapproved of Powell's blog, one can only imagine what she would have thought of this film.",Julie & Julia

Of the two leading characters, I found Julia to be much more entertaining to watch, proving once again that Meryl Streep can do absolutely no wrong. Streep is a joy to watch as she towers over most of the extras as the 6'2 Child and captures Julia's love of life and big personality perfectly. I smell another Oscar nomination coming her way. That doesn't mean that Amy Adams wasn't good, it was just that Julie wasn't as interesting. Stanley Tucci was also very good as Paul, Julia's husband.

246,anshuman218,A Breath of Fresh Air,8,4 July 2011,"These days when Hollywood only seems interested in producing mega- budget action hero films, Julie and Julia although slightly predictable but still provides us with something fresh. In fact, to be very fair it is a throwback to the old Hollywood theme of feel good cinema. The focal point of the movie revolves around food which is always an interesting subject for many.Julie and Julia is a story about two real life women, the famous cook ""Julia Child"" and a devoted fan of her' ""Julie Powell"" and there individual struggles to make sense of their lives.Meryl Streep is so convincing in her role as Julia Child that she completely overshadows Amy Adams portrayal of Julie Powell. On further contemplation one feels that the character of Julia Child deserved a complete film in itself. That said Amy Adams, Stanley Tucci and Chris Messina do justice to their characters in the movie. The film could have been slightly shorter, although it never bores you to that level that you have to constantly check your watch. One major drawback is that after seeing all the wonderful culinary delights you feel that even you deserve a bite into something.",Julie & Julia

Becomes famous.,8,30 January 2011,"As enjoyable as a movie can get, especially if you like food and hate the right wing of the Republican party. There's a little politics thrown in with the chopping of onions, coddling of eggs and writing and publishing a cookbook.Nora Ephron deftly weaves the contemporary story of Julie Powell who spends a year recreating Julia Child's recipes for her blog with a biography of Julia and her husband Paul in France from 1948 on. Based on Julia's book and a collection of letters we learn how she took up cooking as a way to fill the time while he husband was stationed in Paris and later Marseille. After taking classes she was asked to co-author a book on French cooking for American women. It took eight years and all sorts of setbacks but it finally succeeded.In contrast, Julie Powell's blog on Salon.com brought her to the attention of the NY Times and the publishing world very quickly. There tone of the movie islight and Meryl Streep outdoes herself with that Julia Child accent. See my article, Julie & Julia & Book Publishing on Associatedcontent.com.",Julie & Julia
252,gokillyourself-x,"Such a delight, A MUST SEE!",9,9 October 2010,"This is one of the most entertaining movies I've seen lately, or ever. It's not only entertaining, but also motivating! That's why I gave it such a high rating. The movie tells the story of Julia Child, & Julie Powell. The story of how both STRIVE to excel in what they do, going through emotional melt downs, unsporting relatives, relationship drama & other bumps down the road, nonetheless, their determination and positive attitude remained strong throughout the way, till it finally got them all that they aimed for and more. Julie is your favorite drama queen, you can relate to most of the things she goes through during the movie, you'll feel happy, sad & thrilled for her. Julia, one the other hand, you can't help but admire her will power & how focused she is. The scene when she went home & practiced chopping onions was my favorite scene of her in the whole movie & really touched me. Meryl Streep played her role brilliantly.The movie was such a delight. For me, it's like a sack of positive energy. If you've been beating yourself for being lazy & postponing doing what you love, this movie might just give you the kick you've been waiting to get. I even signed up in IMDb just to review this movie & say that!All in all, this is a funny, romance, entertaining drama, but most importantly, a true story. All you have to do is to sit back, enjoy the movie, & let it fill you with positive energy. The message or the feeling this movie will get you, is well worth all of the rating stars. Bon appetite!",Julie & Julia
253,ovidiu-stofor,To be like butter for bread...,9,10 August 2018,"To praise Meryl Streep, winner of three Academy Awards, but also the most nominated Oscar-winning actress in history (18 times) seems a little tautological - embellishes any role.
I'm going to praise Amy Adams - she's plays so natural that you forget it's Amy Adams; especially with this hairstyle.
Pleasant film, with two women in different epochs, with different temperaments but with the same passion - cooking and disseminating cooking information.",Julie & Julia
254,ared-ainu,One of the most unlikable main characters I have ever seen.,1,26 April 2016,"The female blogger this story is about is so bland, self-centered and void of any personality or original thought, it is frankly painful to watch. Even though the story was written by herself, she fails to inspire anything but a simmering hatred at the fact that a person can be so self absorbed to waste everyones time with this garbage. This is also not Amy Adams fault, I truly believe she made the character as likable as humanly possible, but frankly, nobody is good enough to manage that.The story about the cookbook author is interesting though, so I suggest skipping to those parts. Meryl Streep is as wonderful as ever.",Julie & Julia
255,irishfincutie,Not the best,6,1 February 2010,"I was so excited to see this movie that I begged and begged my boyfriend to rent this. Finally, I watch it. I will be honest, I was really surprised at how disappointed I was in this film. I love most of Nora Ephron movies, along with Streep and Adams who have acted well together before and counter each other very well. I think that this movie was a bit draggy. I understand that this film was taking place over the course of 365 days and that this was ""real"" life experiences. However, I found that Julie was turning into a character that I couldn't stand. I think that it is a great thing when people find something that they enjoy doing and sharing that experience with others. Julie's over enthusiasm seemed kind of boastful and arrogant. I won't spoil this film but to be honest, I was really disappointed. Of course the best part was Streep being Streep and at her acting best as the wonderful Julia Child. I loved the background story of Julia and how her cookbook became a part of America's cuisine! I love Julia Child , and I love Meryl Streep. I could have watched just Meryl being Julia!",Julie & Julia
256,munchingonpopcorn,"Food lovers, rejoice!",10,2 July 2019,"This is based on two real-life stories of women; and there's no prize for guessing their names.
Julia Child did to French cooking what Kamalabai Ogale did to Maharashtrian cooking. She made the exquisite art of French cooking accessible to the ""servant less"" American cook just as Kamalabai Ogale wrote her classic book ""Ruchira"" detailing out Maharashtrian cuisine from its simplest to complex nuances. It was and still is the ""go-to"" book for a novice as well as expert cook. Likewise, Julia Child mastered the art of cooking at the world famous Le Cordon Bleu in Paris in a highly male dominated classroom. She then went on to collaborate with Simone Beck and Louisette Bertholle her senior alumni at the Bleu to author the classic book ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"". Her husband Paul and her friend Avis DeVoto supported her unflinchingly in this arduous journey where she had to start from ""how to boil an egg"".
Julie Powell is a modern day Government employee who wanted to add some kick to her otherwise staid life. She loves cooking and Julia Child happens to be the one she idolizes. The year in her life when she choses to cook all 524 recipes of Julia and blog the process, the period of her personal ups and downs, is unfolded here.
The movie cleverly intertwines the life journeys of Julia and Julie, drawing parallels at times and accentuating contrasts during others.
Julia is played by the record Oscar nominated actress and my favourite Meryl Streep and Julie Powell by the talented young actress Amy Adams.
Both stunning actresses playing powerful real-life models turn this movie into a memorable watch!",Julie & Julia
257,lucky-51490,An entertaining watch,7,2 May 2020,"To start off, I have to say, I think I like this movie because it is about blogging and writing. Since I am also trying to build a blog, I relate a great deal to the two protagonists of this movie.I love the idea of telling the stories of two seperated lives connected only through cooking. The story revolves around Julie, a blogger, and Julia, a famous American chef who is known and respected for bringing the French cuisine to the United States. At first glance, it is hard to picture the two of them having anything in common, especially since one works in an office, and the other is a stay- home wife. But then, little by little, the movie reveals the similarities between our protagonists, showing us that it is more than possible to communicate with someone who does not even live in the same period of time as you do.The flow of the movie is very swift and light. As I was watching it, I was thoroughly entertained and even inspired. The storyline is easy to follow, and I had a great time viewing it. ""Julie & Julia"" is a simple and homey movie which is suitable for everyone, and if you are like me who does not know much about cooking, you are going to know a little more about the French cuisine.It is lovely how the movie portrays these women before success comes to them, making you feel very connected to them on a personal level. Both of them are passionate and very serious in what they do, and they are driven by the same passion for cooking and pursuing their dreams.One of the things I like a lot about ""Julie & Julia"" is how very relatable they are to me.Julie's frustration with her social relationships and unhappy job is portrayed brilliantly by Amy Adams, and though I am much younger than she is, I can still relate to some of the troubles which stand in her way. I also like how she turns to blogging to find a purpose for her seemingly boring life, as I am trying to be a blogger myself. The way she treats her husband is the only thing which gives me an uneasy feeling. I mean, he is the nicest and most supportive guy ever, and he definitely deserves more recognition than that!Julia, on the other hand, fascinates me more. I absolutely adore Meryl Streep's performance; her manners, her voice, and her presence, etc. just give me a nice feel. The way she is so persistent in pursuing her cooking career is also very inspiring. She works tirelessly on her books and does not give up even when the opportunities do not come easy. Julia is a good role model for me to look up to personally, because of how her spirit drives her to success. Her relationship with her husband, Paul, is also very admirable, sweet, and lovely to watch. I think he derserves the title husband of the year, really!The only negative thing I would say about the movie, as much as I enjoyed the refreshing arrangement the script delivered, is that Julie and Julia does not really seem like a good match. I feel like it would be better if I get an individual movie about Julia (with Meryl Streep as Julia, of course), because she is such an interesting and attractive person. I would love to learn about her but about her only, not parallelly with another cook, no matter how good. I think she is good enough for a movie of her own already.I understand that the movie's aim is to show the fundamental changes in the society throughout the years, and how the two cooks share certain similarities, and that is good. It is just that my personal preference would be to see a movie focusing solely on Julia's early days, because her life is the kind of experience that is exotic and rare.",Julie & Julia
258,lalatincap,Bon appétit food enthusiast!,10,18 June 2020,"Good movie to watch for audience who has passion for for food may it be cooking or eating. The movie was presented so light but if you look deeper to the story, definetely is relatable to anyone. Be inspired and inspire.",Julie & Julia
259,castro-nani,Julie and Julia,7,23 August 2009,"Most movies when going under the pretense of Based off a true story are rarely ever truthful. No matter how amazing their story, is it possible that the sequences of their lives just happen to fit the standard movie plot diagram? However, Julie and Julia breaks that horrendous stereotype and showcases how life isn't a movie. A delightfully good tale, a somewhat comedic escape, and a pretty wholesome movie; this movie is worth the watch.Like I said before I loved how the movie moved to the beat of its own drum. It portrayed a life for Julia Child as almost a blissful and perfect. She had the world's best husband, a nice amount of money to do whatever she wanted, and the support of everyone around her to pursue her dreams (well except for that evil woman in the beginning, but I'll over look her.) Sure she had a few setbacks, she was only human after all; but it wasn't portrayed so much as a hindrance but rather as a tribulation. You could kind of tell that this was in Julie Powell's perspective by the way Julia Child's problems were made as not that big of an issue in the movie. Julie however, her life was a wreck. But that is what made the movie so truthful. She represented the average woman; the lost girl who isn't perfect and is always only a burnt chicken away from a breakdown. Her endurance of finishing the list of recipes and the clicking clock of time had all movie watchers rooting for her. These two women represented what everyone in the theater was and wanted to be; the servantless person who survives everyday against the wills of sorrow and who desires to be the perfect wife/woman/cook.This movie had a few funny scenes, but nothing to make this movie be categorized as a comedy. It had a few rough scenes, but nothing that would make this a drama. It was neither a family film, nor a Leave your child at home type of film. So what was it? I have no idea. You don't really leave the theater in deep contemplation, but you do leave fulfilled. It was a sweet movie, an endearing story; this is what I would characterize it as.",Julie & Julia
260,stiffman-rosenthal,Vile Movie,1,18 August 2009,"The whole picture is weak - unbelievably weak. For starters, casting Stanley Tucci as Paul was puzzling. He came across as a sensitive guy - not someone who would be married to a woman who is portrayed as an idiot. Meryl Streep plays Julia Child as a buffoon - a cartoon of the real person. Ever looking like she can't focus her eyes, giggling, and making inane remarks as if in a drunken stupor. Dan Akroyd's skit which was hilarious on SNL in comparison to Streep's performance is more thoughtful and less offensive. The only scene which was believable and well done, was where Julia receives the letter from her sister. It was so weird: Paul is normal; Julia is an idiot, and Julie and her husband are bland, bland, bland. It's unbelievable that a woman as bland as Julie would devote so much time and effort to cooking. Julia Child must be turning over in her grave. Shame on Nora Ephron! The true star of the movie was the butter.",Julie & Julia
261,lindabene,Lovely appetiser,9,12 November 2009,"I loved this movie from the beginning to the end. Meryl is a fantastic actress and proves herself here as well. Although her voice is funny, the hairstyle does not suit her, but she can wear it:). I am not a big cook, but this movies put me in a mood to kind of start cooking and pay attention to detail. Both husbands are great characters: supporting, patient, but still give the impression, that they are wearing the trousers:). I would love to read the book as well. The scenery is lovely, shows the real atmosphere in Paris. I like the fact, that even my grandma can watch it as it does not have rude jokes or slang language. Congratulations on acting.",Julie & Julia
262,dsmith-24,"Two Cooks, Juxtaposed",5,18 January 2011,"My main interest in this movie is due to the fact that I simply absorb biographies of all types. I never watched ""The French Chef"" and am not a cook (aside from the survival variety) nor interested in cooking. This movie, however, intrigued me - 50% worth. Julia Child's own opinion of Julie Powell was that she was in effect, pulling a 'stunt' by cooking every recipe in Child's book in 365 days and I must agree. In addition, I found the Julie Powell sections of the movie nearly unbearable; whiny, petulant and boring. I did not care about her or her problems, and I did not want to hear any more about her side of the story. To my irritation, the movie kept jumping from the deliciously interesting Streep/Tucci portrayal of the Childs back to the Powells. I bought the DVD and will continue to watch it, using the fast-forward button to get to the good stuff - the story of the Childs. Wish the entire movie had been devoted to them.",Julie & Julia
263,logans_dad,Great Movie,8,23 September 2009,"Sweetie and I went to see Julie and Julia. What can I say its a great movie. Its about food, love, blogging, perseverance, and loving life. The only way they could make it any better is if they could have thrown in the Dallas Cowboys and a geocache.Meryl Streep steals the show in her portrayal of Julia Child. She is full of life, very animated and not ready to take no for an answer from anybody. I think that Meryl Streep could win an Oscar for this performance. If I had an extra one laying around the house I'd mail it to her. Stanley Tucci plays the perfect, patient, understanding, supportive husband. Amy Adams does a great job as the frustrated young wife and blogger who seeks to do all of Child's recipes in the course of a year. Chris Messina is the supportive, but sometimes, not so patient husband.The story is beautifully done and it is wonderful how the two stories parallel each other years apart.",Julie & Julia
264,ric-163,Delightful...,10,8 January 2010,"is the only word needed to describe this movie. Let me say first off, that Meryl Streep absolutely nails Julia Child. There have been great movies about food, and there have been great movies about relationships. This is a great movie about food and relationships. This film works on so many levels there's no way I can describe them all. The chemistry between Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci is incredible. The relationship between Amy Adams character and her husband, while not as important to the story, was still a treat to watch as well. And the two relationships are united in Julie Powell's (Amy Adams) research of Julia's early adventures in the culinary arts. Not only did I enjoy this movie, I learned a lot about Julia Child and her husband Paul. These are two people who cared deeply about each other, and who supported each other through each others travails. Julia Child's struggle to learn the art of French cooking while being dismissed because she's a woman. And Paul's having to endure the scrutiny of the McCarthy witch hunt. The inclusion of Dan Akroyd's Julia Child sketch from Saturday Night Live is a bonus that still makes me laugh. A great movie with a great cast.",Julie & Julia
265,walkereb,"Like a successful soufflé, it's delicious despite its limited substance.",8,17 August 2009,"Let's be frank. This is nothing more than a feel-good movie. There is no suspense, drama, hidden meaning, last-minute revelation or even real conflict. The film is about two women who loved to cook, and the men who love them and their cooking alike. Julia Child arrives in Paris like Gretel at the gingerbread house. She adores the city and its gourmet offerings. She maintains a childlike innocence and awe throughout her life. She quickly learns she loves food almost as much as her doting husband. And eventually, she realizes that preparing food is what she needs to be complete. Decades later, Julie Powell experiences the same revelation in Brooklyn, though her motive is far more narcissistic. She decides to cook every recipe in Julia Child's cookbook in a single year to show off her culinary and writing skills to a hoped-for (and ultimately achieved) large internet audience.I realize the basis for this movie is a book by Powell about her experiences. But frankly, I was somewhat disappointed every time the camera left Julia to cover Julie. The scenes involving Julia and her husband are magical. It is difficult to imagine two people more in love. And Julia alone is so charming. I don't know whether the real Julia Child was this adorable, and frankly, I don't care. I loved the character, whether real or fictional.Meryl Streep has proved once again that she is the quintessential actress of this generation, and her dedicated fans will maintain a legitimate claim that she is the greatest ever. She conquers yet another accent -- this time, that of one person. But she has more than the voice down. Every movement and mannerism reflects the Julia Child many of us grew up watching. I found myself repeatedly forgetting it was Streep on the screen and thinking it was the real Julia.The majority of Oscar-hopeful performances won't be revealed until the movies of November and December, but I suspect Meryl may have finally earned her third Academy Award -- more than a quarter of a century after her last one. (This much is certain: she will receive an unprecedented 16th nomination.) It is also wonderful to see Stanley Tucci as Meryl's equal rather than her subordinate (as he was in ""The Devil Wears Prada""). They make a great couple. Amy Adams is quite good, as always, but her character isn't nearly as interesting as Julia Child. The movie itself won't earn any awards (or tremendous accolades), but it will make its audience ooh and aah at Julia, her loving relationship with her dedicated husband and those wonderful, mouth-watering dishes both named characters prepare.",Julie & Julia

Sometimes in life (I use this word 4 times and I don't know why) we find ourselves lost, in a street with no out, we get depressed all the time and we really don't do anything to change that. This film is an experience like no other, and when you finish watching it you want to change the world, do something for yourself, stay with your loved one until you die, unconditionally be together no matter what.

It didn't come through though -- it looked like a very, very good parody.Amy Adams' performance was excellent, however. It was much better than the reviewers gave her credit for.It was also nice to see Chris Messina playing her usually supportive mensch husband, similar to his role as Claire Fischer's lawyer boyfriend in the last season of Six Feet Under.In all, a pretty good light entertainment, but not a great and moving film.",Julie & Julia

So she breaks into the mansion of Nora Ehron, and realizes that Nora has no brain after all. Starving and frustrated, she captures Meryl Streep, and sautés her brain in fine sauce. She realizes that she has to publish new book: ""Cooking Brains of Rich & Famous - Mainly Empty Calories"". So she proceeds to collect brains of 99% of Hollywood, and develops recipes that will bring her the biggest fame known to mankind so far. It is important to emphasize that this is a non-violent movie where nobody dies, because all Julia's victims still continue functioning in their lives without brains, and nobody can tell difference.

The gal they picked for Julie was perfect for the part. The Story integrated beautifully with Julia's life. It made me want to open a cookbook and go for it!

The men portrayed were supportive and kind. Of course the main topic is FOOD, French to be exact, and if you are at all inclined to taste, cook, experience French cuisine, then you will love this movie. Meryl Streep's portrayal of Julia Child makes it worth seeing if nothing else interests you. She captures her dead on. Amy Adams is excellent, too, and perfect for the part of Julie. I rarely get touched by movies, but this touched me several times, because the two women sought to succeed and had quite a few obstacles. Behind every successful woman is a good man! I wonder if there will be a surge in gourmet cooking after this movie gets around. There were many great scenes of Parisian restaurants and examples of classical French cooking which isn't done as much these days.",Julie & Julia
271,cadpgmr,"too much Julie, not enough Julia",7,23 August 2009,"I want to reiterate what Anderson said. I read the book and was so utterly disappointed that I tossed the book into the rubbish. I rarely do that and usually donate to libraries, but in this case, I didn't want to share the pain inflicted by reading it.Nevertheless, being a fan of Julia I was compelled to see the movie. Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci were outstanding. Her portrayal of Julia Child was captivating and nothing short of brilliant. Unfortunately those parts were too few. Instead the viewer gets an overload of this self-absorbed whiny bi-polar type character that annoyed me so much that I left during one of her parts. While she was on the screen it was as painful as reading the book.It would be wonderful if they would take the same two actors (Meryl and Stanley) and make a full movie of just that.It was so apparent that Julie was trying to use the fame of Julia Childs for her own benefit. It's not ethical, period! And she even tries to be a sad little victim after it was implied that Julia didn't endorse her. grrrrr! I don't admire anyone who uses people like that, especially passionless whiny people who seem to act like everything revolves around them.So, seven stars go only to the portrayal of Julia and husband. and 1 star to the Julie character because it was a fun idea to do the blog on the recipe experiment.

Amy Adams is her new Meg Ryan, and does perky, plucky cute better than anyone, but her Julie Powell character felt less beguiling and more like a manic Ephron proxy assaulting us with her cleverness. Watching Chris Messina, who plays Julie's impossibly patient husband, chew and smack with his mouth open (a mouth that belongs to a Simpson's cartoon character) in an overly-directed attempt to portray ""gosh this food is good!"", made me faintly ill and eye-rollingly annoyed.

Certainly, the Julia portrayed was pretty damn irritating. However, I understand that others have criticized her acting in this film as a low point in her career. Even if that were true, this entire movie is such a low-point in film that it wouldn't much matter. My girlfriend and I - willing to be willing to enjoy the ride (and not particularly snobby about it all) – were completely puzzled by this film: ""what was the point?"" (including making the film at all).We were essentially bored by the whole process – the only reason that I did not honor her request to fast forward was respect for the actors, hope that the film would redeem itself, and the perverse enjoyment of watching a car wreck.Ultimately, a piece of junk to be avoided.",Julie & Julia
274,Anastasiap98,Delightful!,9,29 October 2018,"The food and wonderful Meryl Streep are the main reasons why watch ""Julie & Julia"" (2009). This amazing actress had never disappointed and this time is not an exception. She always delivers more than can be expected and, in my opinion, she is the best thing about this film. And food, of course. Who doesn't like the food? However, I'd like to talk about it a bit later. Now a few words about the whole film.
So, written and directed by Nora Ephron, it is based on two autobiographical stories: Julia Child's My life in France and Julie Powell's Julie & Julia. The first one tells us about an extraordinary woman, a person who proved that having will and imagination can help you create something new. Julia Child is a woman who made French cuisine to be something not only extremely delicious but real and possible to cook in your own kitchen. The second book contains Julie Powell's blog experiences on the way of cooking all 536 recipes of Child's cookbook in one year.
Julia Child (Meryl Streep) comes with her husband (Stanley Tucci) to Paris and tries to give a right direction to her life. After trying herself in different areas she finally stops at cooking and then, coming through long and difficult way, she writes a cookbook ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"". Then, more than 50 years later, we can see Julie (Amy Adams) who is a writer working for a crisis hotline and who is also in search of something meaningful to do with her life and, how you can guess, she turns to food too. So, making the parallels, both of the women have a lot in common. They both are happily married and have wonderful loving husbands; both are fond of cooking and writing. Nevertheless, I'd like to say that in the film Meryl Streep's character seems to be wiser and more taking-it-easy-person than Julie who seems really obsessed from time to time. Besides, for me it was quite funny when Julie emulated her role model. She tried to act like Julia Child, on her own Birthday party she even dressed like her. Moreover Julia Child is a light-hearted, fun-loving woman. Everybody who meets her adores her for the enormous kindness and generosity. Julie, on the other hand, is disappointed with her life and even ready to swap her relationships for the idea but she is also lovely and all that is just about differences.
So, talking about acting, in my opinion, nobody but Meryl Streep could inhabit the role of Julia Child better. Without appearing to be really working at it, she looks like her, talks like her. Besides, she is even almost the same tall as Julia Child who was very tall for a woman. Meryl Streep delivers a stunning performance, creates something for many to enjoy and I think she is the main reason why Julia Child's side of the movie remains so entertaining instead of being dramatic.
It is also worth to mention that scenery of Paris, French cuisine and the whole French atmosphere supplemented by delicately selected music that works with the scenes, give the film special charm.
I definitely recommend you to watch this film. And not only because of Meryl Streep and French cuisine, as I wrote in the beginning, but also because it teaches you some really important things. Firstly, love and enjoy yourself (particularly for the women who can't get over their body image issues). Just eat and be happy like Julia Child. Secondly, work hard to fulfill your dream and never give up. Finally, be enthusiastic about something you want to do but never forget about the things that are important in life (family, relationship with husband or boyfriend).
So, enjoy this extraordinary film but don't forget to eat properly before!",Julie & Julia

After trying herself in different areas she finally stops at cooking and then, coming through long and difficult way, she writes a cookbook ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"". Then, more than 50 years later, we can see Julie (Amy Adams) who is a writer working for a crisis hotline and who is also in search of something meaningful to do with her life and, how you can guess, she turns to food too. So, making the parallels, both of the women have a lot in common. They both are happily married and have wonderful loving husbands; both are fond of cooking and writing. Nevertheless, I'd like to say that in the film Meryl Streep's character seems to be wiser and more taking-it-easy-person than Julie who seems really obsessed from time to time. Besides, for me it was quite funny when Julie emulated her role model. She tried to act like Julia Child, on her own Birthday party she even dressed like her. Moreover Julia Child is a light-hearted, fun-loving woman. Everybody who meets her adores her for the enormous kindness and generosity. Julie, on the other hand, is disappointed with her life and even ready to swap her relationships for the idea but she is also lovely and all that is just about differences.So, talking about acting, in my opinion, nobody but Meryl Streep could inhabit the role of Julia Child better. Without appearing to be really working at it, she looks like her, talks like her. Besides, she is even almost the same tall as Julia Child who was very tall for a woman. Meryl Streep delivers a stunning performance, creates something for many to enjoy and I think she is the main reason why Julia Child's side of the movie remains so entertaining instead of being dramatic.It is also worth to mention that scenery of Paris, French cuisine and the whole French atmosphere supplemented by delicately selected music that works with the scenes, give the film special charm.I definitely recommend you to watch this film. And not only because of Meryl Streep and French cuisine, as I wrote in the beginning, but also because it teaches you some really important things. Firstly, love and enjoy yourself (particularly for the women who can't get over their body image issues). Just eat and be happy like Julia Child. Secondly, work hard to fulfill your dream and never give up. Finally, be enthusiastic about something you want to do but never forget about the things that are important in life (family, relationship with husband or boyfriend).So, enjoy this extraordinary film but don't forget to eat properly before!",Julie & Julia
276,fominova,A tasteful journey,7,30 October 2018,"The question of inspiration and role modelling is something that always bothered people: despite the constant statements that you shouldn't compare yourself with others we just can't get rid of comparison. We look at our idols and wish we were alike. Sometimes this leads to the great and beautiful changes in our lives as we evolve looking at our models but sometimes envy just eats us inside.
Like any human relationship, the relationship between a muse and a seeker is extremely complicated and may consist of different layers of intimacy between them. So, probably, it's not just a topic where we can find a clear answer but instead, we can roam around it and try to contemplate. The point I'd really like to discuss is that the person of our inspiration and fascination is not as much a real human as a perfect projection of it which just motivates us. With this person's help, we develop something that we already have inside ourselves. To that conclusion probably came one of the main characters of Julie & Julia (2009) directed by Nora Ephron but to get to this she needed to embark on a long adventure of cooking and finding herself in the busy current of life of a thirty-year-old.
The plot evolves in parallels with a time gap over half a century around the lives of two women that at some point were seeking for something to fulfil their days with. Julia Child (Meryl Streep), a wife of an American diplomat (Stanley Tucci) in the distant 1949 is wondering how to spend her days in Paris. She founds her passion for cooking and writes a book ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"". Later, in 2002 her life becomes an inspiration for Julie Powell (Amy Adams) to take a challenge of cooking all the recipes in this book in one year and making a blog out of this journey through the French cuisine. In general, we can call Julie & Julia a story which celebrates delicious food and strong women that gain their strength during hard times of their lives.
I've watched this film several days ago and my personal opinion on it is that this is not a bad movie but is not perfect either. I would give this seven points out of ten and below I'll try to explain why. Besides, I think it's important to mention that from this point on the text may contain some spoilers so to continue reading this review after watching the movie would be the best option.
Picture of the movie is worth mentioning because the very cinematography sometimes is very static and almost every shot looks like a postcard. This definitely doesn't make an impression of a film as a silly rom-com, however, everything there seems to be a bit glorified and therefore unnatural.
The tone is the next thing that seems to be a bit whitewashed because the plot carefully avoids any rough edges. The movie tries its best not to bother the viewer, so the most dramatic and emotionally heavy scene we get is a scene of the boiling a lobster alive. All dark or unpleasant themes are mentioned either in a very obscure way, for example, hints of Julia not being able to have kids, or in a funny fashion like the scene of a cross-examination. So the general, tone of the movie is extremely comforting, sometimes even in a confusing manner.
The composer of the picture is Alexandre Desplat known to the audience for his music to the last two parts of the Harry Potter franchise or The Shape of Water (2017). He usually is a bargaining chip for a movie because as soon as you see his name in the opening titles you can be sure that the music will be good - right emphasises at the right time and definite getting into the mood of a scene. However, for this particular work, it is hard to find something distinctive in the music. It fits the context so well that becomes almost imperceptible.
An undeniable advantage of Julie & Julia is its cast. There you will hardly recognise young Amy Adams as Julie whos acting here is something completely different from something that we could see in her later and much more dramatic works like Nocturnal Animals (2016) or Arrival (2016). Knowing that Amy Adams can carry out very emotional and difficult parts, it is still a pleasure to see her acting, especially in the scenes in front of the computer screen while her character is posting in a blog. The close-ups of Amy's face during her incredible representation of a very intimate act of creating a text reveals all the emotions that come on an author's face through this process which usually nobody sees. Meryl Streep as Julia is incredible in this movie. The actress manages to picture an image of a very trustworthy and cheerful woman, the one that radiates kindness. Streep's duet with Stanley Tucci is far beyond something regular, the chemistry and the dynamics between their characters are truly amazing.
All of these things described before work together with the plot to tell the story in the best possible way. One of its main features of the plot is its parallels. The stories of the two main characters are based on true stories of two real women. The stories are quite similar and it allows the director to play a little with the timeline. We can see a lot of parallels, for example, the movie starts with the move of both women to a new place: Julia to a palace-like apartment in Paris and Julie to a small studio above a pizza restaurant in Queens. The Eiffel Tower is replaced in the frame by a random water tower to show a switch between the stories.
Although both Julia and Julie have very supportive and loving husbands they still struggle Julia because she doesn't have kids, Julie because she lost her prestigious job and has to be a social worker in a stuffy cubicle. And both of them find their comfort in food.
While Julia back in the 60s discovers her talent for cooking and tries to publish her own cookbook, Julie nowadays takes the older woman as a role model. She describes her cooking experiments in her blog in the hope that one day her idol will notice her. And this really happens but unfortunately, Julia is not so glad to know about Julie's blog. Julie feels terrible because she always thought that it was Mrs Child who saved her from the crisis in her life. However, with the help of the loving husband Julie understands that she actually saved herself because she had enough strength for it.
The movie ends at Julia's museum where Julie came to say thank you and pay respect to her. I think that this moment is a key point because it's when we understand that Julie doesn't blame the woman for disliking her blog. Instead, she is grateful to her for all the inspiration.
In the end, we came to Julie's personal example that inspiration may come from different people but it is important to have strength in oneself to carry out something one was inspired to. We can see that in this type of ""muse-seeker"" relationship Julia as a picture, an imaginary friend and a model helped Julie find out something important to her that probably was hidden in herself. This was the result of Julie finding herself but the journey to this point itself was truly amazing. So why do not watch or rewatch Julie &Julia and enjoy a tasteful movie?",Julie & Julia

278,mrandysbell,"Generally well made and performed, typical Hollywood politics & treatment of McCarthy",3,25 August 2009,"There is no need to add to the other comments about the overall quality of the film which is well done with a thoughtful and engaging story. There were a few items which brought the overall story down.1. The use of the f-bomb - not in keeping for the era (late 50s) and unnecessary. It used to be this was a R rating for sure. Beyond that it was completely gratuitous and if left out would not have changed the impact of the scene (and film).2. A few lame jabs are tossed out at U.S. Republicans. Those who see many films may be used to the typical Hollywood left slant - in this case the 'jokes' were not only non-nonsensical but actually detract from the film. A.) Julie works for the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation a government sponsored not unlike your local Housing Authority. Julie admits that she is a government employee and is shown to be honestly, actively engaged in her work even going 'above and beyond' on at least one occasion. Who has ever called a government employee a 'capitalist'? B.) Seriously calling sick as plot device? What she needs a doctor's note; is this real life or Jr. High? What gov't employee does not have sick time or personal time? Was this chronic? If so the reprimand was justified. If not it doesn't make sense in light of effort to show her as the good worker. So why would her boss call attention to his idiocy? (I am not a Republican, I am not a schmuck. But don't do that again.) Is that funny? In any case they are elements that if left out would make the film better, kind of like the nudity in Schindler's List, self-indulgent and unnecessary.3. But beyond all that is one of the underlying elements of the Julia segments - McCarthy. Absurdly, Paul is called all the way back to the states from France for 3 days of questioning; where he is exonerated. The significant question highlighted was ""Are you a homosexual?"" Was Joe McCarthy investigating homosexuality? Of course not. So what was it that Paul did that left him with a cloud of suspicion as a communist - taking 3 days to clear up? Lived in China as an embassy appointee, was involved with..... The only hint in the film is that he liked to check books out from the embassy library, which recently had it's collection reduced because of Joe. While I know nothing about Paul and Julia Child history has shown that Joe McCarthy was more often right than wrong. But this does not fit the conventional wisdom that McCarthyism = unjustified witch-hunt. And this in a story supposedly about 2 true stories",Julie & Julia

It wouldn't have been difficult to coax a more substantive performance out of ""Julie"" - she seemed so truly shallow by virtue of the naive acting: waving hands, cute looks, etc , etc - in her scenes in fact, the food was more the star. HOWEVER - perhaps most egregious ( and I am shocked it was not mentioned more prominently) - are the numerous technical errors in filming! The most outstanding of these being the nearly constant intrusion of the boom mikes into the visual field! My goodness! Filming 101! Clean up the technical errors- it was terribly distracting and undermined the viewers' engagement in the story,etc.Shocking! I am also not sure why we needed to see the entire SNL 'Bleeding Julia' skit- weird!

283,englanddg,Aspiring Foodies Unite,10,14 December 2009,"Every few years a movie contains such a natural mix of acting, writing, costumes, scene design, lighting, effects, and score that the story shines above it all, and this is one of those movies. For a short period of time, you find yourself completely enveloped, what a wonderful experience.Other reviews have criticized the role of Julie. I tend to agree. Though the acting was believable, I had trouble sympathizing. I found her whiny and selfish, but that may be exactly the point. I ended the movie wishing for more of Streep's wonderful and humorous portrayals, as well as more trivia about Julia's amazing life. However, I challenge, if not for the weaker storyline of Julie, the stronger storyline of Julia would not shine quite so much.I'm still a bit miffed at the line when Julie's boss is dressing her down for skipping work. Her boss says, ""Anyone else would fire you. A Republican, would fire you. I'm not a schmuck."" I just don't understand that line. So, he didn't fire her, so he's not Republican, but he's not a schmuck? I'm lost...and wonder if that was a final dig scene thrown in for political reasons at the last minute as a private joke for the director and the production team.The two minor points with the movie I found completely short, but highly entertaining...First, Julie's experiences with cookbook instructions (her failures). I think just about everyone who has used a cookbook has felt that frustration. It's almost as if the writer is leaving something out just to remind the reader that we are rank amateurs.The other is Julie's Mom. It's a situation I think most can empathize with. The opportunistically supportive mother (or father). Full of criticism and praise, but never real advice.In the end, it was a pleasurable experience, and the best movie I watched in 2009 by far.A humorous movie that makes you laugh without trying, makes you introspective without preaching, and makes you hungry...well...just watch it and you'll see why.I highly recommend.",Julie & Julia

One of the main reasons I was so exhilarated to see this movie was that I've always been a big fan of fine cooking and just like everybody else, I love food, the whole idea of food. Topped my expectation, the biography/comedy/drama feature appealed to me as a breeze of fresh air, full of inspirations delivered chiefly by a convincing plot and hints of sporadic yet witty humor.The movie renders an artful parallel between two ardent women separated by a gap of generation, Julia and Julie. Julia Child is a typical, middle-aged American housewife full of humane characteristics and convictions; bored in the midst of France, she goes through various hobby classes to find her best suit just like trying on shoes. Julie Powell's situation syncs quite well with that of Julia: stuck with a job she hates, constantly fails to accomplish things and most disappointingly, finds life uninspired. These two women both found their way out in cooking and that's also how these stories are linked.Though embracing the same familiar motifs, common incidents and dramas of life, Julie&Julia generates a different, idiosyncratic path of storytelling that leads to the ultimate question, also the tag line of the movie ""DO YOU HAVE WHAT IT TAKES?""

These trailers cover very adult themes such as catastrophic end-of-the-world; a serial murderer step father; and, a child murdered by a pedophile speaks from the grave describing her ordeal. Wow -- pretty somber stuff to endure before being rewarded with the visual treat that is Julie and Julia. You may wonder how a film rated PG-13 can be preceded by trailers with such adult themes and content. Easy, there's a MPAA loophole that allows unrated trailers to be shown to general audiences! Pretty sad that National Amusements takes advantage of it, to the detriment of such fine fare as Julie and Julia. So, if you plan to see this movie soon, be prepared for a big dose of murder, mayhem and pedophilia before you see it in a National Amusements theater.

291,pmg-entertainment2012,Delicous & Hilarious: Yay good acting!,8,17 August 2009,"When I check out IMDb, I often times like to see other reviews and how a movie panned out for viewers across the board. Granted, IMDb likes to order their reviews with the best first, but I make sure to change that setting to chronological so as to see the full scope of commentary. I was happy to note that ""Julie & Julia,"" on the whole, was received well. I am also happy to report that I am amongst those positive reviews.As a musician and entertainer myself, I often view movies as an escapist luxury from the normal day-to-day (which for me, doing what I do, is usually far from normal). That being said, I also watch movies with a very critical eye, even B-list action and horror films. It is so refreshing to see a comedy have some substance in modern film, and ""J/J"" really delivers. If I wasn't a fan of Stanley Tucci before, I am now, and probably will be for life. He is the embodiment of true poise and timing for the male comedic actor (and acting in general, not to take away from his prior work and obviously vast experience). Watching him & Meryl interact is satisfying and engaging; I always love when acting pairs come back to do more work together - who didn't enjoy them both in ""Devil Wears Prada?""The film itself is a sincere (if not liberally leaned) commentary on American society and its views on home-cooked meals, with a lot of good humor thrown in for flavoring (pun definitely intended). Meryl Streep is the acting Aunt I wish I had growing up, LOL. Real skills, total ease in her character here, and a avid eye for detail in dramatic interplay. Amy Adams, who I really enjoyed in ""Miss Pettigrew,"" does a fine job of portraying the ""average"" American middle-aged rat-race worker. I am excited to see her next big gigs and how she develops dramatically.I think what made me enjoy the film the most were two things: 1) The more stage-themed acting from the cast - it was almost like watching episodes of ""Lucy,"" where all they really did was put on a play and place a camera in front of them, & 2) The audience, which ties into #1. Because the actors made a point of banking on comedic timing and buttons, the audience & I ate it up and were hysterically laughing as if Meryl, Amy, & Stanley were up in the front doing scenes from the movie live.Overall, GREAT film. Definitely go see this one in theatres, or with good friends when it comes out on DVD - then cook some beef bourguignon!Peace, P.

292,BHudgins64,Can a blog really get you a book contract?,8,3 September 2009,"Many writers get annoyed when they see someone get a big, fat, book contract simply because they wrote a blog. In this movie, Julia and Julie are paralleled in many ways. They both ""did their own thing"" against the advice of their parents. They both married supportive husbands. They both enjoyed cooking. And they both had the ultimate goal of getting a book published.One difference is that Julia Child simply fell into book publishing by accident because she met two women who were writing a cookbook for Americans soon after she completed her Cordon Bleu training. Julie Powell on the other hand couldn't get her fiction book published so she began to blog about cooking to get her mind off her stale job. She followed the recipes in Julia Child's cookbook as a way to get her writing out to the public.Many publishing gurus suggest that writers use a blog as a way to get a platform or a fan base. From there it's easy as pie to publish a bestseller. Right! I foresee another million blogs cluttering the internet because of this movie! I believe many people did not like the Julie character, not because of Amy Adams, but because she achieved success so easily while it took Julia Child years of work and editing and creating recipes to achieve her masterpiece.I have written an article called, Julie & Julia & Book Publishing on www.associatedcontent.com if anyone wants to see further thoughts on this thread.",Julie & Julia
293,kevinbarry01,Lame,5,5 September 2009,"Everyone knows this is a chick-flick, but it also a fairly ""thin"" movie. The plot is paper-thin, the acting is either over-the-top (Meryl Streep) or one dimensional (Stanley Tucci and everyone else). For all the noise about cooking, there seems to be very little memorable cooking in the film at all. The last recipe is simply handled dismissively. I guess it was mildly interesting learning about Julia Child, but only mildly. Nora Ephron has to include two scenes of ridiculous anti-republican bigotry, just to please her Hollywood leftist friends, and of course, for any movie to be taken seriously in Hollywood, there has to be a scary scene where the GOVERNMENT is after homosexuals. You can almost hear the squeals of delight when that scene rolls through the film. Honestly, it was just a lame movie. The five is for the very good scenery and location shots. The movie was well crafter, but not well written.",Julie & Julia
294,aikanaro-earfalas,How to kill great food 101,1,23 October 2009,"Ephron and Streep have much to answer for. They turn Julia Child into a twittering, blithering idiot, the kind of irritating flibbertigibbet that makes you want to reach for a baseball bat and take a wild swing. Ephron is clearly not just sleepless in Seattle, but equally clueless in the kitchen. She has no feel for food, no sense of the indescribable joy of a great dish. Her screenplay is flat, the film's staging is sophomoric and the dialog inane. Where Chocolat brought us the sensuality of a patisserie, and Ratatouille celebrated the act of transforming ingredients into food -- an appeal to all the senses -- this film dumbs it down to some uber-Neanderthal level. The characters are unidimensional. Streep quacks like D. Duck. The ladies' relationships with their husbands make no sense. Ephron can't even get a kiss right -- the actors sound like suction cups. And just when you think it can't possibly get worse, there's Streep again, squeaking like wet rubber, lolling her head drunkenly and rolling her eyes. That's not acting. That's just stupid. The film insults your intelligence, tests your patience and desecrates food. And, by the way, Ms Ephron, it's not ""boof bourguignon"", it's ""boeuf"". Pronounced *berf*. You're better off spending the running time of the film over at epicurious.com.",Julie & Julia

I love french films, the quaint aroma they give off, cute music etc. but sometime they can be a bit too seriously passionate. This film manages to capture the essence of French film with the 80's feel of a US movie (mainly the contrast of American ignorance vs European culture), to give you two sides of a very different story. I don't want to go on, but you should watch this movie if you like classic 50's movies but also if you like the modern rom-coms as this truly does combine both. Put it this way, after watching the first half, I went out and bought french red wine, camembert and crackers to watch the second half. The acting is really well done, Meryl Streep is at her all time best, you'd just LOVE her as an aunt or mother-in law, she's hilarious, Amy Adams is really well cast as a downtrodden, bottom feeder of the career world, seeking more but achieving this by more than being the usual corporate a-hole. Enough, go watch it, its great, I'll watch it again in the future, for sure. As a male, I know the girls will love it, get it for them next Christmas!",Julie & Julia
296,elaabs8,Too many liberal Democratic political undertones,2,23 November 2009,"Last night my wife, another couple and I saw the movie Julie & Julia. All of us had heard rave reviews about the actors, the story and how funny the film is. To the films credit Amy Adams is very good and reminiscent of Meg Ryan with her Mary Poppins looks and Mary Tyler Moore determination. Meryl Streep does a nice job as Julia Child. The character actors were marginal, shallow and boring, but the movie is about Julie & Julia.Although it did have some funny moments, the movie had far too many liberal political undertones. Several references were made to then Senator Joseph McCarthy investigations of government employees seeking communist infiltrators. (Where are they now!?!) Historically speaking, Senator McCarthy was a decent, conservative man. A true patriot and the scourge of liberals who single handily prevented Communists from controlling Washington in the 40's & 50's. Also in the movie, Julie Childs father (a conservative Republican from Pasadena, CA) was made to look out of step with the times and foolish, although he is still a step above the French.The sexual references were crude, continuous and certainly tainted Julia Child's career. In another seen Julie is informing her co-worker about Julia Child, ""Did you know that she married at age 40 and was still a virgin!"" (only liberal virtues here) When Julie calls in sick for work to re-do a recipe, she is confronted in her bosses office the next day. Her boss is upset about her taking time off and tells her that a Republican would fire you over this.....but I'm not a schmuck!"" (Again only a liberal democrat would write this!) Take out the politics and sex out, which had added no value to this movie and it would be a bigger hit. The Saturday Night Live scene by Dan Ackroyd stole the show.

Heck, the only time I have even seen a copy of her classic cookbook, Mastering the Art of French Cooking, was at a glance in Barnes & Noble one time. I have, however, read her intensely charming autobiography, My Life in France, and, like blogger-turned-writer Julie Powell, I feel as though I know her. That is, I believe, just how Julia was. To see her, to hear her, to read her words is to know that there was someone in the world who was purely good, strongly fearless, and endlessly adventurous. Julia Child was the type of person we all want to be. Julie Powell embodied that desire when she sat down to begin a seemingly insane project: cooking all of Julia's recipes in one year. She documented her journey in a blog, eventually turned that blog into a book, and watched as her book was turned into the very film I am reviewing right now.Read My Full Review Here: http://www.sincerelychrisclark.blogspot.com/",Julie & Julia

However, the movie could have been so much better if Nora Ephron possessed the ability to separate her personal politics from her writing and directing. Ephron worked for JFK as an intern and her politics as I understand it lean to the extreme left as many in Hollywood do. There is one line in which the boss of Julie (Adams) tells her that he would fire her if he was a (mean) Republican. If a conservative tried to do this then they would be lambasted by the liberals but individuals like Ephron do not understand the hypocrisy of their own actions. Decent movie but could of been a lot better. If you are offended by movies where a director attempts to make political statements in a movie that has nothing to do with politics then I would avoid this film.",Julie & Julia

When I look at the list of goofs and anachronisms, it's clear to me that this movie was directed by somebody who thinks she is too good actually to research things or pay attention to details. This could have been a good movie, but unfortunately Nora Ephron decided to make it into a political tract. It would be different if she seriously and honestly explored political movements. But simply to snipe at more than half the population is, well, typical of what goes on these days and reveals more about her personal anger than the subject at hand. I love to cook.

I was refreshed by the love between Julia and Paul/Julie and Eric. Not too many movies inspired by true events, book to film, etc. truly capture the essence of the story. This film depicts the trials and tribulations of a true marriage. Coping with struggles and celebrating triumphs, Julia and Paul support and encourage one another and force their relationship into a symbiosis steeped in superb meals and delightful eating. So much happens when people cook and dine together, vocabulary is heightened, dialog is stimulated and teamwork is fostered. I found myself laughing out-loud in the dark alone in my apt. watching this film by Nora Ephron. I must also admit that I found my eyes well and flood a few times because I was so touched by the love the characters had for one another. I almost never watch ""chick flicks"" and love stories but this film defied the basic formula for a box office smash hit. Everyone knows a good story has the basic elements: characters we love, a great dilemma/problem, a pinnacle loss, a grand journey, a forced solution, and an ending where we all learn a lesson. Julia and Julie 2009 has a formula all its own. My parents always loved Meryl Streep picture movies and I think Stanley Tucci provides an excellent support system. I now have a deeper appreciation for seasoned talent. These actors consistently continue to reinvent themselves taking on iconic characters and collaborating with the greats. What's next from the cast members?, I look forward to laughing at myself again. (Spell check this before posting please). Mahalo Piha; J",Julie & Julia
301,priya90,A wonderfully warm and light-hearted watch...,8,10 February 2011,"To be honest, I didn't think much of this movie when I started watching it (alone, since I was saving the better ones for company) but Julie and Julia turned out to be delightful.I was hooked, in a pleasant way, from start to finish. In fact, I don't recall there being a dull moment in this movie and it ended about five minutes ago. I'm sure you all know the plot by now, so I won't go into details about it.About Julie and Julia 1. Julie Powell (Amy Adams): I personally found the Julie part more interesting, probably because I could relate to it better. Boring, monotonous lives, crappy places to call home, and personal conflicts: all of us have gone through this at some point (As a harried student, I am right now) Julie is one such woman. She has dreams, but she is too far down the current path her life has taken to act on them, and she is frustrated as a result. She has mood swings, and she hates her friends for being better than her. She is real in a way, unlike her husband and even Julia and Paul, who all seem so one-dimensionally good. Amy Adams does a very good job as Julie, especially considering her exaggerated performances in some of her other movies.2. Julia Child (Meryl Streep): I'm very young, too young actually, to enjoy old English movies and their actors. I only watched Meryl Streep in Its Complicated and I didn't have too much to say about that. But as Julia Child, she proved to me why she is considered one of cinema's greats. She was my absolute favorite actress in this movie (and the reason I write this review; I needed to praise her somewhere) I'm amazed at how comfortable she is in this role! She's charming, confident and most of all, hilarious. And it is one of the most natural performances I've seen. In fact, after the movie, I watched some cooking videos of the actual Julia Child and all I can say to Ms Streep is, RESPECT! There is not much of a story other than what the plot outlines, and the movie focuses entirely on the two leading ladies. I will actually go ahead and call this a lounge-movie - definitely give this a pass if you want to be fully engaged. But after the a long, tiring day, if all you need is a light, feel-good entertainer, I think this is as good as it gets.",Julie & Julia
302,pinupprincess1317,Julie and Julia... not the best.,3,10 May 2010,"I am a huge Meryl Streep fan, and this movie was at the bottom of her performance list , in my opinion anyways. I didn't really see a point to this movie, the only moral or lesson I could find really was how Julie wanted to start the blog and finish it... so the moral is to finish things you start-- I didn't really understand why Julia's character was so old fashioned looking, and Julie was so modern. They were both living at the same time; so the completely different lifestyles threw me off a bit. Also, you didn't really learn much about Julia and her husband, they referenced them a bit, but not enough to really get a feel for their characters.. also why is Julia in France taking cooking lessons, if she'd already published a cooking book?? I just don't understand the point of this movie, the basis of it's appeal, and the general story line wasn't explained well enough in my opinion. Sorry Meryl and Amy =[",Julie & Julia
303,harrij07,Julie & Julia is a comically portrayed story based off of real world events.,10,1 May 2011,"Julie & Julia is a comically portrayed story based off of real world events. Julie, played by Amy Adams, was the girl in college everyone thought was going to be someone big due to her drive and aspiration. She is just about to turn thirty, has a less than ideal job, and it caught in the daily routine. Julie has a great husband, Eric who is played by Chris Messina, but her life is missing something. The one thing Julie finds helps her to distress after her less than ideal day at work is cooking.The other side of the movie is Julia Child's, played by Meryl Streep. Julia's part of the movie is told using flash backs from the 1950s. Julia's husband Paul, played by Stanley Tucci, was assigned to Parris. Julia also had a love for food. In order to have something to do during the day while Paul is at work Julia signs up for professional cooking lessons. Julia is amazed with French cooking, but is unable to find a French cook book written in English. Julia along with two other women put together a French cook book for American women.Julie has a special place in her heart for Julia Child's and decides she is going to cook all 524 recipes from Julia's cook book in the next year while logging about the experience. The film allows the viewer to see the importance of both women's lives while they find what matters most to them. The theme of the movie is the importance of having a goal and following through with it. The other portion of the theme is the importance of being able to balance one's life. Julie's husband leaves one night after a fight because Julie is focusing all of her energy on her log and neglecting her duties as a wife. Having something to help one feel accomplished is important, but it means nothing if you do not have someone to share it with.During Julia's time in Paris she loves everything about Paris. In the film Paul mentions to his pen pal that normally everyone things people from Paris are rude, but not Julia. This comment points out the importance of one's attitude. Everything is all about what is made of the situation. If the individual decides to make the best of the situation they will. Julie & Julia is a good reminder of one's attitude. If one makes the best of the situation they will be happy in whatever they do. The theme of the movie is similar to Letters from Juliet. Being able to make the best of the situation is always important.The angle and lighting used in the film helps to enhance the desired reactions. In one scene prior when Julie is working on one of the recipes and she is not having very much success she practically has a nervous break down. She is lying on the floor crying and the angle of the shot allows the viewer to feel sympathy for just how disappointed Julie is. The angle shows Julie throwing a tantrum on the kitchen floor and Eric in the living room answering the phone. The angle of the shot allows the viewer to see what is going on with both individuals at the same time. There were several scenes which due to the angle of the scene allows the viewer to feel as if they are part of the scene.The second technique used throughout the movie to pull out the desired reaction from the viewers is lighting. In the scene mentioned above regarding Julie laying on the kitchen floor the lighting is visible, but dull. The darkness in the scene sets the audience up to feel sorry for Julie. In a different scene Julie is sitting at the kitchen table and receives some great news on the phone. The lighting is done so that Julie appears to be glowing. The lighting allows the viewer to see visibly how excited Julie is.This movie helps to emphasize the importance of prioritizing what is important in one's live. The lighting and angles in the movie help to create the desired reaction from the viewer. It is a great movie for the entire family to enjoy together. Viewing the world through two different women's experiences in different times is creative and entertaining. Reference: Mark, L. (Producer), & Ephron,N. (Director). (2009).

304,user-38-914422,"a Trip about Food, Love and Life",8,26 April 2011,"Julie and Julia: a Trip about Food, Love and Life365 days, 524 recipes, one girl and a tiny kitchen; how far will it go? Based on two true stories, the movie Julie and Julia, released in 2009, was directed by Nora Ephron, a true master of romantic comedy (When Harry met Sally, Sleepless in Seattle). This is a delightful, warm and inspiring movie full of tender scenes and inviting French food which absolutely brings you all-around enjoyment.The film tells parallel plots of Julie Powell and Julia Child's lives. Cooking connects these two protagonists, who never meet. Julia Child (Meryl Streep) moves to France with her husband Paul (Stanley Tucci) and learns cooking there. She publishes a famous cook book ten years later and becomes one of the most beloved chefs on American television. Julie (Amy Adams), who is in her 30s, lives in a small apartment with her husband (Chris Messina) and feels depressed about her soul-killing job as a clerk. To escape the monotony of everydayness, she decides to cook her way through 524 of Julia Child's recipes and record that in her blog—in just one year. As Julie approaches the end of her project, the result is unexpected, but affords further thought.Have you ever fallen into a rut, like what happens to Julie? In the film, she is driven crazy by sustaining complaint hotlines at work; she cried, but sits silently in her small cubicle. That scene reminds me of the moment I was in a mess and feel hopeless. Although the film deals with some trivial things in life, which could be a minor problem, it resonates with viewers and is thought provoking. Other than cooking itself, in Julie's process of imitating Julia, the movie leads us to some serious points: how to face life and what the more important thing is than just fulfilling your dream. Passion and persistence for cooking, and love from others, these are what Julie possesses but tends to ignore in process of carrying out her project. Sometimes we are so concentrated on result, being blind to joy in the hustle and bustle of everyday life. As a result, we forget to love; love the things you're doing and love people in your life. I was astonished, realizing how cooking echoes to our lives. In the film, Meryl Streep's pleasant performance is one gem which drops you right into the story. I also found some of Julia's real TV shows. After watching them, I have to say that Streep's heated voice, weird accent and exhilarating laugh show us a wonderful and lively Julia Child who is enthusiastic, perseverant, and full of passion for life. Although it's a little exaggerated, her body language in the movie especially captures Julia's awkwardness, making the character more likable. Even if you have no interest in cooking at all, you will find some fun watching it. In one scene, Julia is talking with a French woman; she combines English with French but has no idea which language she is speaking. I chuckled at the comical atmosphere of this movie. ""Julie and Julia"" uses warm colored pictures and lovely background music with a dash of nostalgia to convey to us the love of life. Like what Paul says to Julia: ""You are the butter to my bread, the breath to my life"", the love between two protagonists and their husbands is heart-warming. ""Julie and Julia"" is a perfect choice for those who yearn to experience a delightful film. It will make you forget what's going on in the real world and take you to the wonderful place of food, cooking and love.",Julie & Julia
305,emsneeri,"You are the butter on my bread, you are the breath in my life.",8,28 April 2011,"I stumbled upon this movie on Netflix during a rainy day. Based on the book ""Julie and Julia"", it made a great movie. The movie is based on Julia Child's life in France with her quirky attitude about life and learning to cook for her husband. The movie is also placed in present day with a young adult named Julie Powell who is newly writing a blog daily on cooking for her boyfriend.Meryl Streep plays a loud and lively Julia Child. Streep is great in this role. She plays a cooking icon. I used to watch Julia Child on TV with my Grandma when I was little, and Streep is right on. She caught Child's different sense of humor, not always accepted then. She fights her way through culinary school in France with her husband Paul by her side, who is madly in love with her. She finds herself out of place in France when he husband, a diplomat. She is around all of these fancy new things that aren't what she is used to. She feels uncomfortable in many situations and she makes the best of them, adding her humor. No matter what she went through, Paul was always by her side.Amy Adams plays Julie Powell who is a young lady living in New York living her life vicariously through Julia Child in present day. Although her part is overshadowed by Streep's, she still does a good job. She starts writing her own blog. Writing about cooking one recipe per day in Julia Child's cookbook about French cuisine. She plays a cute part and I think does a good job and walking us through the journey of learning how to cook ""fancy"" cuisine. She is a normal person and that is refreshing, you can relate to her and the problems she faces. She begins cooking for her boyfriend and this allows them to become closer and creates problems in their relationship.This movie starts out a little slow but ends up as a delightful pick that I would watch more than once. Streep playing Julia makes me wish I were around to experience her on TV. You feel like you get to know her and Paul in this movie. Streep's performance was uncanny as Julia.There were points during the movie where I was laughing from some of Julia's lines and there was a point where I was crying. There aren't any over-dramatic, unrealistic points in this movie. It is very relatable. Everyone knows who Julia Child is and it is an overall cute movie comparing two lives that are so similar in different time periods.

I never knew the real Julia Child, but Ms. Streep's portrayal inspires me to seek old footage.The script focuses most on the parallels between two women separated by time yet inextricably linked by a love for the culinary arts. Julie Powell's character is a subtle indictment of the modern woman. Her shallow quest for external affirmation in order to feel as ""purposeful"" as her cobb-salad cohorts is a sobering contrast to Julia's passion for food and expression of self.Many details of Julia's life are glossed over, especially as it pertains to her political views.

It is split in half, intertwined really, about the lives of Julie Powell, a blogger, and Julia Child.The reason why I call this a biopic of a thief is that Julie Powell's claim to fame is blogging about Child's recipes...I mean seriously she put no real creativity in other than writing a diary of her travails of cooking someone elses recipes. I don't blame Child for not wanting to have met Powell. Powell's fame is on the back of a real culinary chef who actually did creative work to put together a recipe book based on French cuisine but relatable to American cooking.Anyway, I would've rather had seen a biography of Julia child without the meanderings of Powell's purile attempts at trying to be a writer.",Julie & Julia

The performances by the leads and the many supporting roles are great - you can't help loving the characters portrayed. The biographic nature of the 'Juila' story combines nicely with the more present day 'Julie' storyline - leaving the viewer to route for Julie's cooking goal while simply falling in love with Meryl Streep's Julia Child. In both stories we are treated to the women's relationship with food, husbands and the challenging worlds they inhabit. Predominantly, there is a real sweetness about the support each husband gives his wife and a fair amount of chuckles throughout.

I didn't think he would be that in to it, but I was happy to glance over and see him laughing and enjoying the film as much I was.This film delivers on every level. First of all, the script is absolutely fantastic. At first, I was wondering how the film would tie this middle class bureaucrat living in Queens with Julia Child living an ideal life in Paris in the late 1940s and early 1950s. But the two women soon pulled me in (Streep and Adams are both pitch perfect in delivering), and I lost all doubts about the film. Hardly is there a scene that isn't delightful in and of itself. There are no, what I would call ""throw away"" scenes just meant to get you from one plot point to the next. I was really rooting for Child to succeed. I even found myself comparing my personality and life to that of Julie's.I love this film. I think Streep will be up for another Academy Award nomination (or at least I think she should be).

I am one that considers anything more challenging than a 30 minute meal or one pot dinner cookbooks to be beyond my cooking abilities.The comedy Julie and Julia revolves around a post-911 governmental secretary with desires to be a writer and the blog she writes over a year's time. During the day, Julie Powell played by Amy Adams takes calls from the families of 911 victims. At night Julie is frustrated and feeling inept as compared to her successful power broker friends. With the support of her husband, Eric (Chris Messina), Julie creates a blog to discuss the experience of cooking her way through Julie Child's 500 recipes from ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" in 365 days. As the story develops the scenes jump between Julie Power living in a small one-bedroom apartment in Queens in 2002 and that of Julia Child portrayed by Meryl Streep living in Paris in the 1940's and 50's. Throughout the movie the audience sees the parallels between the lives of Julia Child and Julie Powell. In one of the first weeks at Le Cordon Bleu, Julia is seen in her Parisian kitchen practices dicing of onions. In a similar scene, Julie Power struggles to get five lobsters into a steam pot. By the end of the movie, the audience comes to realize both women find that difficult tasks can be accomplished through perseverance and practice.The director uses the flashback technique to bridge the struggles Julie has tacking the taste of blogging her way through the recipes; in the kitchen, with her friends and in her marriage to tie the viewer to the obstacles Julia Childs had in her own life adopting to life; living in a foreign country, feeling like an outsider at the cooking school, and her own marital struggles.The score written by Alexandre Desplat, a French composer, uses musical styles familiar to our ears to tie the time period and location to the viewer. When in New York, the score has a current sound as Julie works in her kitchen and writes her blog. In Julia's kitchen in Paris, the music is much more willowy, using more wind instruments and a sound that is reminiscent of a time period when dancing to waltzes' was the norm.A woman lost and searching for something to inspire her as seen in Julie and Julia has a similar theme to the theme in the film ""Under the Tuscan Sun"". The later movie follows a recently divorced woman as she buys a villa in Italy in hopes of finding herself.Julie and Julia, an American comedy, is an enjoyable film that doesn't require too much thought provoking effort and is simply entertaining.",Julie & Julia
312,vvvessiana,The movie 'Julie and Julia' is based on the true stories of two cook - Julie Powel (Amy Adams) and Julia Child (Meril Streep).,8,10 September 2015,"Writing a review of a movie like 'Julie and Julia'(2009) is difficult because there aren't many occurrences taking place - the plot is simple and common. It's based on the true stories of two cook - Julie Powel (Amy Adams) and Julia Child (Meril Streep) and I think the feature is interesting by reason of two things: the first is the fact that the success is a book/blog away and the second – the quality of the love between spouses in each of the couples. I have always believed in the good turns maybe because too many bad turns happen as well. Plane crashes, car incidents, people incidents, unexpected betrayals, sinister health diagnosis. And at once we have movies on true stories wherein the main heroes get return for the experienced misfortunes. When read articles on such movies I realized that the plots are often dissimilar than the real lives of the participants and sometimes they are striking changed. Reality is very relative notion and everyone gets it differently even when the persons are at the same place in the same time. Because of that it isn't easy the real events to be reflected, especially in a film. But after all I was very surprised when I heard about the real Julie Powell's marriage problems – a modern woman with ordinary job who makes a cooking blog and has the goal to cook a few hundreds meals for one year using the recipes of the famous chef Julia Child. The feature shows how Julie's husband supports her, also shows his unconditional and infinite love, a lot of good advice and generally he is represented as Mister Right. But it turns out that they both had extramarital relations during the period of their lives produced in the movie and also after that. I have read they are got together several times. This somehow spoiled the romantic impression this movie had left in me. Anyway, Julia is good at cooking, despite some nervous breakdowns, annoying girlfriends, her mother who always has the opposite opinion and the lack of comments on the time she started her blog. No matter what the reality was, she has published best-seller books, there is a movie based on the one of them and, I guess, more many successes I don't know about. What I disliked in the picture is the emphasizing on the love but maybe the authors have wanted to tell that without the support of somebody who loves us we wouldn't be able to represent ourselves before the world successfully. That applies to Julia Child and her husband Paul, too. The two stories of the both women with the same name take place in parallel. I know nothing about the private life of the great cook and have read only few recipes of her book 'Mastering the art of French cooking'. But I have realized her huge efforts to publish it in time of political instability. Of course, when I saw the photos of real Julia she didn't look so beautiful and charming as Meril Streep. Actually, it isn't necessity but thinking about the movie I first remember the actresses and then the real women. 'Julie and Julia' is a movie in which the daydreams come true and it provokes us to believe in our own dreams. The belief in the cinema is an absolutely different topic and it isn't a vital necessity. But the dreams are definitely.",Julie & Julia
313,ng-64680,I love this culinary film!,10,7 December 2015,"This film focused on two main characters who is Julie Powell, a young writer in New York and Julia Child, a chef, and author of Mastering the Art of French Cooking in Paris. In the story, Julie is living in New York City and doesn't like her job working in a call center. One day,she found a French cooking book and decides to cook every recipe out of it. To motivate herself, she even starts to write a blog to share her progress. She is hoping someone will read her blog one day. Julia, who lives in Paris, was an ordinary housewife. To spend her time, she tries to learn French and to take some cooking classes. Finally, she found herself more enjoyable spending time in the kitchen. She just has the talent in cooking and able to teach other people later on. After mastering the French cooking, she starts cooperating with her friends on publishing a French cookbook for American housewives.Throughout the film, I found that theme is all about French cooking and women's challenges. Both themes were applying to Julie and Julia but in the difference period. They found the joy of cooking and have marriage support in their self-challenge. Both women's husband support is incredible, except there is a short period when Julie's husband feels unhappy after seeing her over devote into cooking and leaves her. This film reminds me to the other comedy film, Chef. That film is about a chef who quit his restaurant job and run a food truck with his menu. Carl Casper, the main cast also receives his family support to run his business. From the very beginning scene, it was started in Paris around the 1950s. The whole film is about Julie, who lives in the present,shadowing Julia Child in the past. Thus, we see a lot of the flashback technique. When Julie is exploring the recipe, the scene will show how Julia did in the past. This technique is used very often when the story happens in the kitchen. There is another technique, the point of view shot was used in this film as well. This shot can be seen when Julie and her husband stay in their bed watching a comedy show. They have been laughing so hard when watching the show. The shot is bringing us to see what they are watching by shooting the TV show for the viewers. Also, this shot also being transfer back to them showing their reaction. The technique of objective point of view is one of the fundamentals of film editing. This film is based on two books. In my opinion, this story theme is about how a woman success with their marriage support. A woman has to give up a lot to find what she loves to do. No doubt, every hardship cannot solve without family support. As a women myself, I feel like they are my role model in my career. I think I fall in love in this film!",Julie & Julia
314,kellyjuwara,Julia Child's story of her start in the cooking profession is intertwined with blogger Julie Powell's 2002 challenge to cook all the recipes in Child's first book.,5,17 December 2015,"Julie and Julia is a film directed by Nora Ephron released in 2009 which stars Meryl Streep, Amy Adams, Chris Messina and Stanley Tucci. It is the story of world famous cook Julia Child's intertwined with the story of blogger Julie Powell's 2002 challenge to cook all the recipes in Child's first book.Meryl Streep is a wonderful actress and the shines through in this film. In the past, I watched a few Julia Childs cooking shows and Meryl does a great job in her portal as Julia Childs. She was so charming and convincing, you feel as though you are really watching Julia and you become intrigued by her character. Her hair and makeup are spot on. Meryl's truly puts a smile on your face.Amy Adams also does an exceptional job in the film, she really connected with her character as Julie Powell a distraught woman trapped in a dead end job attempting to cook all the recipes in Child's first book.. Her sense of humor makes some of the characters tough moments seem light hearted. Chris Messina plays Julie's husband, Eric, he doesn't bring much to the film. Finally, Stanley Tucci plays Paul Childs Julia's husband, he brings a lot to her character. The two of the have great chemistry you truly believe they are in love. .As for the negative, the film moves kind of slow a bit in the middle. The switching between Julie and Julia works great at first, but eventually becomes annoying. Eventually you may begin to feel like me and just want to learn more about Julia's story, it is a lot more interesting than Julie's. Overall, definitely worth watching somewhat enjoyable just make sure to eat before attending because some of the cooking scenes may make you hungry.",Julie & Julia
315,frankyoualot,Imagine,9,29 September 2011,"Imagine, a film where nothing horrible happens every 5 minutes to keep your interest, and you have a fun film that makes you smile, inspires you (oops - maybe you don't want that), and leaves you wanting more.10 stars for Meryl Streep for her truly entertaining portrayal of Julia Child. For those who don't appreciate the real Julia from long ago, I'd expect you to research, watch a few of her shows, then come back and give it a higher rating than you did! Also, if you don't appreciate the raw talent of Meryl Streep, just compare her to the incredibly sterile acting you see prevalent in current films.It also portrays, accurately in my opinion, the struggles of surviving in this crazy world. Well done!",Julie & Julia
316,teresacordeiro,Eating hot chocolate in the winter,7,19 June 2021,Probably the coziest movie I've seen in a while. I'm kinda of amazed that my current t-shirt and shorts didn't just turned into a giant blanket and the fireplace didn't automatically start. Kinda want to start to cook now...,Julie & Julia
317,athaccount,"Work, spending hours cooking, and then what...sleep?",1,14 February 2018,"Not believable!!!! There's only so much time in one day. There is no way you can go to work, come home and spend hours cooking...and somehow manage the time to clean. its a fairy tale. how do these people spend all this money they logically do not have. the whole movie...These people are spending money...yet we never get the story of how they got the money, they spend money throughout the movie...What is this movie about? how rich i will never be...? And what timeline is this? 90's? 2000's? no clear point of view. this movie is not down to earth at all.. just shows rich people...maybe seeing a homeless person every now and then would show depth. All i see is a wool blanket suffocating us thinking its ok to spend money you don't have.",Julie & Julia
318,emshark,Delicious,8,14 July 2009,"I was lucky enough to receive tickets for an advance screening, and was plenty excited about attending.There was a slight hiccup when someone started the film 15 minutes before it was meant to start so they stopped it ten minutes in and then restarted it again at the actual time. This actually was not annoying at all because it gave me a chance to look at the background details. Mid-20th century Paris is beautifully rendered and early 20th century New York is given gritty charm with a primary setting of an apartment over a pizza parlor. Now I know it was an advance screening and everyone was excited to be there, thus much more prone to laugh, but honestly, this film had brilliant moments of humor in it. Myself, friends, and the rest of audience had a number of laugh-out-loud moments. A lot of these stem from the mannerisms of Julia Child, which are as incredibly endearing as they are humorous. Meryl Streep's acting is, of course, superb. Though my familiarity with Julia Child is a combination of what seems to be legend, a visit to her kitchen in the Smithsonian, and Dan Akroyd's SNL impersonation, Meryl plays Julia so charming and so convincing, you can't help but feel like Julie and fall a little in love with her. On screen, Meryl's Julia brought a constant smile to my face.Amy Adams is also wonderful, and I really connected with her as Julie Powell. She also does great humor. I found her to be very subtle in her approach and even quite sympathetic when not going through her good moments. Chris Messina as Julie's husband, Eric, does a lot to keep these moments fresh. Finally, Stanley Tucci as Paul Child plays well off Meryl, and dare I as a 21-year-old say it about actors so much older than me? Meryl and Paul honestly have great chemistry.What really steals the show and appears great on cinema is both Julia and Julie's cooking expenditures. Make sure to eat before attending, I can't stress that enough because the food looks amazing.As for the negative, the film does drag a bit in the middle. The switching between Julie and Julia POV works great at the beginning and at the end, but I think in the middle, it just makes the plot drag.Overall, definitely worth going to see and quite enjoyable just make sure to eat before attending!",Julie & Julia
319,martinalembo-11435,Enchantée!,7,30 October 2018,"As well as ""Midnight in Paris"" can take you back to the 1920s, ""Julie and Julia"" will let you fall through the 1950s and 2000s, both in Europe and US.
This 2009 American comedy-drama film, directed by Nora Efron, will keep you at the edge of your seat for 2 hours, especially thanks to the majestic interpretation of Meryl Streep, who won Golden Globe Awards as best actress in 2010.
The movie is based on 2 real stories and draws inspiration from the book of the writer Julie Powell.
""Julie and Julia"" can be summed up as the story of a Legend, Julia Child (Meryl Streep), who gives one woman, Julie Powell (Amy Adams) the recipe to change her frustrating existence.
To escape the monotony and dissatisfaction with her life in the Queens, the 30 year-old Julie Powell is suggested by her husband creating a blog in which she can combine her passions: writing and cooking.
Her plan is to cook in one year all the 524 recipes in Child's cookbook, and starts documenting her daily progress in The Julie/Julia Project.
In parallel to the story in Powell's time in 2000s is Child's in Paris, and other cities, throughout the 1950s. Julia Child is a middle class woman in her forties who still doesn't know what to do in her life.
Considering her love for food, she decides to attend Le Cordon Bleu in order to learn French Cuisine and write a cooking book in English for American housewifes.
Both of them have to cope with some obstacles but eventually everything goes smoothly: Child manages to publish her book after nearly 10 years, while Powell finds enough fame to become a writer.
The film is not only about succulent mouth-watering dishes which make us hungry all the time. The funny scenes, like the one with Julia savagely dicing so many onions, also leave space to more serious topics.
Political issues are raised, when talking about McCarthy's government, as well as marriage problems.
Both women are too much swallowed by cooking and single-minded, but while Julia can always count on her patient husband Paul, the same doesn't occur to Julie.
Her obsession for her blog and Julia, in my opinion too exaggerated, comes to dominate her married life and her Eric leaves home for a little time.
Anyway, there are some things that make this movie far from perfection.
The classic cars, French cafés, background music and clothing choices with hats, tailleurs, pearls, gloves do fit the style of the 1950's France, whereas there's little attention to the costumes and set designs of Julie's times.
Secondly, I haven't enjoyed the husbands, who have been assigned only their supporting roles in their marriages.
I also think that a film like this should have deserved a better and more popular soundtrack.
On the whole, I really recommend you to watch this movie. Don't forget to buy some pop corns or snacks, because the cooking scenes will make veeeery hungry!",Julie & Julia
320,twntythrd,French cooking philosophy: nothing is impossible,9,30 October 2018,"Skillfully directed by Nora Ephron, this film intertwines the stories of two wonderful Julias in a parallel way. Timelines of the plot differ: two epochs expose different problems the heroines have to face, while, on the contrary, their spirit seems to be of the similar nature. Both are driven by the very same passion - cooking, and nothing seems to stop them in following their dreams and reaching their goals.Probably the best way to give credit to the whole cast and crew is not to review every little aspect of filmmaking but to form an overall opinion, to feel the story instead of thoroughly analysing it. And in this particular case everything is just in the right place to let your emotions and first impression gain the upper hand.The acting is unbelievable. Totally superb. Since the very first meeting with every character you can't help but emphasize them completely till the very end credits and even later, feeling the aftertaste of the whole film. Each one has their own unique background, each of them trying to escape the routine and has their ups and downs. Exceptionally talented Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci do not act, they do not perform - they actually live in a romantic France of the 20th century with its marvellous gastronomy.A special credit goes to the general atmosphere. Soft light and warm colors together with retro cars, old film cameras and glossy postcards work as a time machine leading you through the early 1950s, especially while backuped by slow american jazz perfectly matching the light mood of the scenes. Besides, many details, despite being minute, ephemerial and often hidden ""between the lines"", give a subtle yet quite tangible insight into a political and social life in Europe and the US in the middle of 20th and the very beginning of 21st century.And, finally, the whole process of cooking is depicted in such a delightful and inspiring manner that in the end it almost makes you agree with one of the Julia Child's mottos - nothing is impossible.The more impressing and motivating is the story as it tells us about real people, it is based on their biographies and their books. And the simple truth is that Julie&Julia is perfect for a quiet Saturday evening after a hard and stressful working week and a good dinner with mulled wine. Oh, and, no doubt, it is especially recommended to those who share the same passion as the main characters.",Julie & Julia
321,ValeriyaBatorshina,"Julie and Julia: worth watching, worth rewatching",8,30 October 2018,"First of all, before watching the film, it's better to eat because all the food there is so mouth-watering.
Nora Ephron has definitely done the best she only could. And the fact that it was her last film before her death makes me a little bit happy because her last masterpiece was light, kind and humorous. The actor's cast and the music were so well-chosen. Not even talking about Maryl Streep who amazed everyone with her play. She won so many awards for this film.
There are so many strong and beautiful parts in Julie and Julia. And each of them brings a bunch of emotions. For example, the moment when Julia Child chopped onions in Le Cordon Bleu. She was so proud of herself, but the day before she was chopping a whole big packet of onions before she started doing automatically. And, when her husband came back from work, he even ran off the smell because it was too eyes-watering. Maryl is amazing in the role. It suits her so much. There were no too much in her acting. The critics were amazed by her. Everyone was, Watching Julia Child's part was really heart-warming and cozy.
However, Julie Powell's part is kind of weak. Sometimes it was really boring to watch it. I couldn't wait for the new Julia's appearance in the film. Maybe it is because Julie's portion of the film is not so interesting as Julia's. It's just like we watch something strong and inspiring and something weak. What I really liked in this part is the enthusiasm that Julie had when she started her blog, her cooking. It was inspiring. And what is more inspiring is how she was obsessed with Julia Child and her book, and food, and cooking. It wasn't a mad obsession, it was the good one. The switching of timelines and places is a pretty food idea that I like, between two grade cities Paris and Queens, New York.
What truly amazes me is Julia and Paul's couple. We see that their love is eternal and wonderful. The way how they support each other and maintain ideas of each other, both love eating. I really like that each time when Julia wanted to find herself in anything, Paul was the one who encouraged her no matter how crazy her idea was. The chemistry of Streep and Tucci amazes.
I really liked the beginning of J&J and the middle part was good, but I was a little bit confused by its end. So, Julie receives a lot of messages from agents and journalists, goes to the museum of Julia Child and that's it? What happened next? Where is a strong ending of the film I was so waiting for? Julia receives the first copy of her book and what? I want to know more. What were her plans then? What did she achieve next?
By and large, I would definitely advise everyone to watch the film. Of course, tastes differ, but even if it is boring for somebody, it would worth watching. Now, I'm going to rewatch it and read Mastering of Art of French Cooking.",Julie & Julia

I am glad to say that I have rarely seen a movie where revolting manners are more prominently on display. I felt insulted to see a really good actor like Meryl Streep portray one of my favorite TV stars (Julia Child) as a braying vulgarian. YUK!",Julie & Julia
