0,bkoganbing,It Helps To Have a Rogue with you,10,19 March 2006,"One of my favorite films of the last decade of the last century is The Rainmaker. It kind of got lost in the wake of all the fuss over Good Will Hunting and the joint Oscar Matt Damon and Ben Affleck took home for that original effort, but I'm a big fan of this up to date Frank Capra like courtroom drama.The Rainmaker was a studio project as opposed to Good Will Hunting and it has an impressive cast list to support Matt Damon as newly minted attorney Rudy Baylor taking on a big insurance company in a big civil lawsuit. Jon Voight, Virginia Madsen, Bruce Willis, Danny Glover, Dean Stockwell, Roy Scheider, are all in this. Cast wise it is as impressive as that film adaption of that other John Grisham novel, The Firm, also by the way set in Memphis, Tennessee.But I think that the supporting cast member that really makes the whole film work is Danny DeVito. Dec Shifflet, para lawyer extraordinaire who hasn't come around to passing the bar exam, is absolutely sensational as the street smart legal eagle without a license whose street smarts are some of the best ever put on the screen. How he was overlooked in the Oscar sweepstakes in 1997 is beyond me.The Rainmaker marked the film farewell for Teresa Wright who plays Mrs. Birdsong, Matt Damon's landlady. Matt cuts Teresa's lawn on the weekend and writes her will in his spare time. By the way, check the scene where he handles Teresa's inquisitive son. Matt wasn't totally without street smarts himself.The main plot is involving the suit of a young man, dying of leukemia, who is suing his medical insurance carrier because they would not approve the treatment needed to save him. It's a story that Frank Capra would have jumped on during his career. Young idealistic attorney takes on insurance company in his first trial. The insurance company and their hired legal guns headed by Jon Voight. As you watch Damon in court you see the faint shadow and hear the faint echo of Gary Cooper or James Stewart. But even those guys had some help from the Danny DeVitos back then. Good to have at least one savvy rogue on your side.The Rainmaker is good courtroom drama and there isn't a player going that doesn't want one of those. And here Matt Damon got it in what was his first starring role. How better to begin a career.",The Rainmaker
1,SnoopyStyle,Great talents in solid court drama,7,22 December 2013,"Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon) is fresh out of law school. He has no family, or any connections. He starts to work for notorious lawyer Bruiser Stone (Mickey Rourke), and with street smart Deck Shifflet (Danny DeVito) who can't pass the bar. They take on a case against a health insurance company who refuses a claim from a seriously sick boy. Meanwhile, he falls for Kelly Riker (Claire Danes) who is in constant fear of her abusive husband.This is a simple David vs Galioth story from the pen of John Grisham and the directing skills of Francis Ford Coppola. There are big time talents involve in this. Matt Damon is superb in the boyish charm department. Danny DeVito likewise is superb. The acting in this movie is top notch. However the Claire Danes battered wife storyline is too simple and too separate. It doesn't really connect with the rest of the movie. The romance seems to be sidelined in importance and short shrifted. It needs more attention. On the other hand, the courtroom drama has good fun and good tension.",The Rainmaker
2,classicsoncall,"""There's nothing more thrilling than nailing an insurance company!""",9,21 March 2020,"When you consider what freshly minted attorney Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon) accomplished taking on a mega-insurance company and it's coterie of hired gunslinger lawyers, the story isn't very believable, but it works on screen due to the talents of multiple players. Danny DeVito is particularly effective as a street smart para lawyer, a term I never heard before but it seemed to fit his role in the story. The thing is, you expected him to be a sleaze ball throughout the picture, but he surprises when the chips are down with an occasional spark of humanity.Besides the main plot of an insurance company failing to provide for the family of a doomed leukemia patient, there's a side story involving Damon's character protecting a young woman from an abusive husband. I'd have to say that Rudy Baylor's close quarters battle with Cliff Riker (Andrew Shue) would qualify for one of my Top 10 Movie Western brawls of all time if set in a different genre. One of the best and most destructive I've ever seen on screen.Given his more conservative political views, I was surprised a bit to see Jon Voight cast as the sleazy corporate attorney Leo F. Drummond, surprised I guess that he would take on such a role. But after all, it is only a movie role, and his presence adds solidity to the story. What I thought the screen writers could have done a better job with was Drummond's closing argument on the case, which called for fairness by not awarding an exorbitant judgment to the plaintiff. Because that's all he had, I wasn't surprised that the jury came in with a significant punitive damage decision.Coming as late as I did to this film, Matt Damon struck me as exceedingly young, but it's over two decades since the film came out (as I write this). If you missed out like I did when it was current, you'll do yourself a service to take this one in as both a human interest story and compelling courtroom drama. Even the minor players contribute exceptionally well in this finely crafted story based on the John Grisham novel.",The Rainmaker
3,lee_eisenberg,over and under the soil,7,5 December 2006,"I remember when ""The Rainmaker"" came out in November, 1997, I was thinking a lot about rain saturating soil (here in Portland, we're known for rain). Since this movie is set in the South - where rain saturates the soil all the time - it sort of worked into my thoughts. I had never heard of Matt Damon before the movie came out, but I was quite impressed by his portrayal of a novice lawyer going after an corrupt insurance company. He looks like some teenage nobody, but he knows that he has to build up the will to do what's right. I will say that Danny DeVito came across as a little silly (he has a New York accent in Memphis, and there's the scene in the hospital), but his character makes it worthwhile.When the trial comes, one can feel every cast member's touch. Aside from Damon and DeVito, there's Jon Voight's menacing stare, Dean Stockwell as the judge, Claire Danes's waiflike touch, Mary Kay Place's sense of the baby boom entering middle age, and even Teresa Wright (in her final role) as the older generation slowly disappearing. All very impressive.So, this may not be Francis Ford Coppola's best movie ever, but I still recommend it.",The Rainmaker
4,jboothmillard,The Rainmaker,6,4 July 2005,"I previously watched this movie in college, but I had not written the best film review for it, so I watched it again to settle this problem, based on the book by John Grisham (The Firm, The Pelican Brief, The Client, A Time to Kill), directed by Francis Ford Coppola (The Godfather, Apocalypse Now, Bram Stoker's Dracula). Basically, Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon) is a graduate of the University of Memphis Law School, but he has high-paying job lined up. Desperate for a job, he is introduced to J. Lyman ""Bruiser"" Stone (Mickey Rourke), a ruthless but successful ambulance chaser (finding clients in hospitals), who makes him an associate. To earn his fee, Rudy is required to hunt for potential clients at a local hospital. He meets Deck Shifflet (Danny DeVito), a less-than-ethical former insurance assessor-turned-paralegal. Deck has failed the bar exam six times, but he is resourceful in gathering information and is an expert on insurance lawsuits. Rudy finds a case of insurance bad faith which could be worth several million dollars in damages. He wants to help a middle-aged couple, Dot (Mary Kay Place) and Buddy Black (Red West), sue insurance company Great Benefit, on behalf of whose 22-year-old son, Donny Ray (Johnny Whitworth), who is dying of leukemia, but could have been saved with a bone marrow transplant, denied by the company. Rudy passes the Tennessee bar exam but has never argued a case before a judge and jury. Now he finds himself up against a group of experienced lawyers from a large firm, headed by Leo F. Drummond (Golden Globe nominated Jon Voight), an attorney with unscrupulous tactics to help him win cases. The original judge, Harvey Hale (Dean Stockwell), is set to dismiss the case, seeing it is a ""lottery"" that slows down the judicial process. When Hale suffers a fatal heart attack, a more sympathetic judge, Tyrone Kipler (Danny Glover), takes over. Kipler, a former civil rights attorney, immediately denies Great Benefit's petition for dismissal. While seeking new clients, Rudy meets Kelly Riker (Claire Danes), who suffers severe domestic violence from her husband Cliff (Andrew Shue) whose beatings have put her in the hospital. Rudy persuades Kelly to file for divorce, which leads to a confrontation with Cliff that results in Rudy beating him nearly to death. To keep Rudy from being implicated, Kelly kills Cliff, and tells the police it was self-defence. The district attorney declines to prosecute. Donny Ray dies, but not before filming himself on video giving a deposition at his home. The case goes to trial, where Drummond gets the vital testimony of Rudy's key witness, Jackie Lemanczyk (Virginia Madsen), stricken from the record because it based on stolen evidence. Nevertheless, thanks to Rudy's determination and some help from now fugitive Bruiser, Jackie's testimony, and her evidence, the Great Benefit Employee Manual, are readmitted. Rudy's skilful cross-examination of Great Benefit's president, Wilfred Keeley (Roy Scheider) is the evidence that leads the jury to find for Donny Ray's family entitled to damages but also punishing damages that are more than Great Benefit have. It is a great triumph for Rudy and Deck, with Keeley being arrested by the FBI and an investigation into Great Benefit launched in multiple jurisdictions. However, the insurance company declares bankruptcy, allowing it to avoid paying the many damages. There is no pay-out for the grieving parents and no fee for Rudy. Deciding that this success will create unrealistic expectations for future clients, Rudy decides to abandon his new practice and teach law. He and Kelly leave town together, heading out for an uncertain, but bright, future together. Also starring Shadow of a Doubt's Teresa Wright as Miss Birdie, and Randy Travis as Billy Porter. Damon is terrific as the inexperienced young lawyer, Voight is great as his slimy rival, Danes does well as the battered wife, and the other supporting cast members like DeVito and Rourke are good. I just about kept up with most of what was going on, obviously all the legal mumbo jumbo went a bit over my head, but the trial scenes are engaging, a little mechanical at times, but a worthwhile courtroom drama. Good!",The Rainmaker
5,ccthemovieman-1,Great Storytelling Despite Overt PC,9,1 March 2006,"It is rare that I would rate a piece of strong liberal propaganda this high but I've always really enjoyed this film, even if it is blatantly manipulative in its political correctness preaching. It's just great storytelling, regardless.The film features a deep cast and one that puts on a great displaying acting, from the lead ""good guy"" Matt Damon to the lead ""bad guy"" Jon Voight to all the performers somewhere in the middle, headed by ambulance chaser Danny DeVito.It's not a believable story at all - a rookie lawyer fresh out of school outsmarting a team of proved veterans with big money backing them - but it makes for a good story. Everyone likes to root for David against Goliath, which is what this turns out to be. Just one example, by the way, of the political correctness in here: the kid lawyer's hopes of a fair trial only become reality after the older, obviously-corrupt white judge suddenly dies and is replaced by Harvard- educated black judge (Danny Glover, of all people). Now, as it's quickly demonstrated in the film, a man of Liberal sensibilities will be bring fairness and justice to this case!The story is not flattering to lawyers, but it's not all-condemning either. It's pretty balanced in that regard. It's just good storytelling and, I might add, without much profanity. Damon does very well in this choice role and once again demonstrates why he is considered one of the best in the crop of today's younger actors. It helps that he portrays an extremely likable character, who not only sticks up for a poor, neglected family against a big, wealthy corporation but rescues a sweet woman (Clarie Danes) from her physically-abusive husband at the same time! Wow, he does it all: SuperLawyer!Danes is very appealing as the battered wife who winds up being romanced by Damon. That part of the film is not distracting, but a nice break from the legalese of the main story. It helps make the movie even more involving. There is very little ""action"" in here but not much is needed to keep one's attention since it is so entertaining for the full 2-plus hours.",The Rainmaker
6,rmax304823,Rite de Passage,8,10 December 2004,"All cultures have what the sociologist Arnold van Gennep called ""rites de passage,"" also sometimes called puberty rituals, in which the initiate enters the ceremony as a child and emerges as an adult. Coppola and his team show us Rudy Baylor's rite de passage as an attorney. Matt Damon, as Rudy, is a fresh faced preppy-looking kid just out of law school. After working for the sleazebag played by Mickey Rourke and going into partnership with Danny DeVito (who has flunked the bar exam six times), he can look back down the slope and pick out the idealism he left sprinkled along the route of his ascent. He winds up quitting practice.But it's not a particularly gloomy story. I missed the credits when I first saw this so I had no idea who had created it. I expected a cheap ne plus ultra of mind-numbing commercial fluff. What else would anyone expect with a title like that -- ""John Gresham's 'The Rainmaker'""? Shades of Sydney Sheldon! The opening didn't suggest much more than that. There is a voice-over by Matt Damon explaining his background and expectations to us. And we see him being guided open-mouthed through the slimier parts of the judicial system. DeVito introduces him, for instance, to ambulance chasing. Not too promising, really, because professionals who operate within heavily guarded social borders -- like lawyers, cops, doctors, and pilots -- almost always assume that the audience is too dumb to know that collusion between a judge and a prominent lawyer takes place. The lay audience is now cynical enough to recognize Perry Mason for the Norman Rockwell fantasy that he is.But it was much better than that. Half-way through I began to think, this director, whoever he is, is pretty deft. I was surprised at an undercurrent of humor. Sometimes it was situational. Two lawyers for instance, dashing into a courtroom to try a case, neither of whom has a license to practice law. (""Sworn in by a fool and vouched for by a scoundrel,"" Damon muses.) Sometimes the humor requires less attention. (In the middle of a dramatic pause, DeVito, eager to deliver a piece of evidence to his partner, stumbles loudly over a waste basket.) And there were smaller, delicate touches. A splatter of blood spots on a wall as the camera cuts away just before someone is hit over the head. Damon and Claire Danes (with whom a love bond is too quickly established) in a prison visiting room, unable to express their affection because they are lawyer and client, except that under the table the tip of his shoe slips forward and brushes the tip of her boot. (Wow. Nice touch.) And Claire Danes' wife-abusing husband is a stereotype if there ever was one -- yet after his murder is discovered and the blinking screaming police cars arrive and she is about to be taken away, the wife-abuser's family can be heard in the background shouting, ""DAMN you, Kelly. What did you do? You killed my SON?"" Coppola and the writers have given this moron a previously unheard-from family of his own, and added another surprising dimension to his character.And I couldn't get over the performances. There are several unexpected small parts taken by well-known actors. And every one of them has a life of its own. Virginia Madsen is being interviewed in a motel room by Damon, and she spills the beans on the malignant corporate megagiant that provides the unoriginal heavy. As she speaks, she smokes a lot and the camera moves slowly down her arm to show her fingers trembling in her lap. Only later do we learn she has psychiatric problems. (Cinematic synecdoche!) Roy Scheider is extremely good too, a disdainful presence in the witness chair. He's from Orange, New Jersey. Why does DeVito so often seem to wind up in movies with other actors from New Jersey? What is it about that state anyway? Does the Jersey Devil have something to do with it? Why does hail always have to be the size of something else? If the universe is expanding, what is it expanding INTO? Anyway, this, for Coppola, is a pretty straightforward story, neither the grand opera he's attracted to, nor the more quiet ""personal"" films that usually come in between.I really kind of enjoyed this one. Of the current crop of younger actors, Matt Damon seems to me to have the most talent, as opposed to, say, Keanu Reeves. And Claire Danes is so frangible, so beatable in this movie; even with her leg in a cast and the rest of her limbs and head in bandages, she's morbidly alluring and radiates a sort of semisexual heat. Come to think of it -- well, never mind. See it if you can. It's pretty good.",The Rainmaker
7,blanche-2,"Good story, good acting, good direction",8,28 March 2008,"Matt Damon is ""The Rainmaker"" in this 1997 film based on the John Grisham novel and starring Danny DeVito, Jon Voight, Mickey Rourke, Mary Kay Place, Teresa Wright, Clare Danes and Virginia Madsen. Well directed by none other than Francis Ford Coppola, ""The Rainmaker"" tells the story of a rookie attorney who goes up against a corrupt insurance company that sold policies to poor people that they never intended to honor. Damon, who plays Rudy Baylor, represents a family whose son is dying of leukemia because the insurance company refused to pay for a bone marrow transplant.This is a great story that has the usual Grisham touches: the corrupt big law firm, the honest attorney, big stakes, David versus Goliath. The only problem with this film is that the company and the attorneys on the other side are almost cartoonishly evil, corrupt, and uncaring. Not that they don't exist, but perhaps if they were less obvious, the story might have been more believable. There's a subplot of Rudy's involvement with an abused wife (Danes), which gives a break from the main plot.The acting is excellent all around in this powerful story. Damon is totally natural as a quiet yet passionate young man in way over his head; DeVito plays his partner who has failed the bar five times - he's a riot; the over-plasticized Mickey Rourke brings glamor and likability to the part of ""The Bruiser,"" the attorney under FBI investigation that Rudy originally goes to work for because he can't find another job. Dean Stockwell plays a sick judge in tight with the insurance company's lead attorney (Voight) - between his coughing and pill-popping, Stockwell gives a highly entertaining performance. Mary Kay Place is a standout as the boy's mother, poor, dignified and devastated, and Red West is heart-wrenching as her gin-drinking husband whose grief has rendered him nearly speechless. Johnny Whitworth does a beautiful job as the son. There is top-notch work as well from Teresa Wright as Rudy's landlady and Virginia Madsen as an ex-employee and witness. Voight's good old boy slimeball attorney is great, but as mentioned earlier, the role is written to give him not one redeeming quality.""The Rainmaker"" is well worth watching. It really grabs the viewer's interest, has another nicely developed performance by Matt Damon in the lead and a powerhouse supporting cast.",The Rainmaker
8,Quinoa1984,"the strengths of the ensemble, and nifty storytelling, make up the best of this conventional picture",8,25 December 2006,"Francis Ford Coppola knows the kind of motion picture he's making with The Rainmaker, adapted from one of the countless bestselling John Grisham novels, which means there are perks to be had here, however with some reservations. These reservations come with the territory though, and really come with any drama set in the court room, which is the simplicity of the ""little guy"" having to go up against an overwhelming force that pays its lawyers a thousand dollars an hour. Maybe not all court dramas, but I'm reminded of not just a possible Law & Order episode pulled out of a hat, but Lumet's the Verdict, and several other contemporary court story, however with circumstances shifted and the charges greater or lesser. Such is the case though with the 'overwhelming force' that in The Rainmaker comes with ""Great Benefits"", an insurance company that denies claims made after their clients have already been duped into signing up for their company. And so Matt Damon, as Rudy Baylor, faces off against the company- and their main player Drummond- and added on top of this is the fact that Rudy, just out of law school and passing his exams, is on his first case.While he doesn't have the kind of personal baggage and demons that Paul Newman's character had in Lumet's film, Grisham's story gives Baylor the problem that comes with his 'love interest', played by Claire Danes. But it's a strange love interest that starts up, as he sees her as the victim of spousal abuse- triggering his own past of being in such a household- and it becomes a sort of tense situation that comes to a high peak with a really well done attack scene at night (it's strong precisely because Coppola, no pun intended, pulls no punches with this fight scene, as it's really graphic in how far it goes into the terror of a domestically violent climax). Aside from that, Baylor is really just the typically courageous young man looking to make the other side that he can't stand get what's coming to them- the other side being the lawyers he once thought just wouldn't accept him and realizes are just foul in their own manner. So the case then unfolds, in the sort of traditional Grisham style (if you've seen other Grisham thrillers or read the books you know what I mean), and of course one can sense the outcome a mile off.So why then is the Rainmaker so impressive if it seems to be bound by conventions of David more than likely conquering a Goliath (or would-be Goliath in this case)? More than anything because Coppola trusts that the audience will take this as a Hollywood picture, and almost something of an 'old-fashioned' one, so to speak, with some of the supporting characters sort of out of the ranks of past films (Teresa Wright is one of them, in her last role, as the old lady who lets Rudy have a room to rent out during his trial). Coppola also, with one exception, doesn't get in the way of telling a story that at it's core is entertaining in its simple form of the right versus wrong and the injustice of malpractice and greed being outshone. This exception is probably in the narration by Rudy, which is sometimes effective, but sometimes is also a little overbearing and- considering it's from Michael (Apocalypse Now) Herr- tells too much where Coppola could just as well show. But aside from just getting down a technically proficient and occasionally slick drama/thriller, he casts terrifically, more than just type, as to all of the actors given their strengths and nature.Jon Voight is in one of his better roles in recent years as the dangerously smart and smarmy lawyer for the company; Mickey Rourke comes off quite well in his few scenes as a 'shark' lawyer type (the kind that doesn't stick around for the trial, as he's away somewhere nobody knows after a corruption scandal); Danny Glover as the judge, convincing without trying much at all; and smaller parts from Virginia Madsen (she might be my favorite, as the disgraced ex-employee of the insurance company) and Roy Scheider are made totally fleshed out through Coppola's direction and skills as a dramatist. Danny De Vito, however, makes his mark here more than anything, and is a great counterbalance to Damon's young and scared/confident lawyer. There's even some sweet bits of light comedy that get put in, not much but just hints, at the charmingly sneaky ways that De Vito's not-quite lawyer character has. In the end, the ensemble really forms with the material, and it's ultimately a very watchable couple of hours. It might lack the harrowing impact of Coppola's best, to be sure, yet I would not think to pass it off as just a studio assignment either. He takes the material and his actors seriously, and it's a fine picture content to be itself- heartstrings and all- which may appeal to some more than others.",The Rainmaker
9,wes-connors,Matt Damon Passes the Bar for Francis Ford Coppola,9,11 April 2009,"""Francis Ford Coppola directs and scripts an exciting, star-packed adaptation of John Grisham's novel about an idealistic young attorney who takes on the case of a lifetime,"" exactly as promotional synopsis promises, ""Matt Damon plays Rudy Baylor, a rookie lawyer in over his head on a high-profile case. Opposing him: an army of seasoned legal sharks (led by Jon Voight). On Rudy's side: Deck Shifflet (Danny DeVito), a feisty 'paralawyer' who specializes in flunking the bar exam. Rudy's chances are slim to none - until he uncovers a trail of corruption that might lead to the one thing that could win his case: the truth."" Mr. Damon's almost simultaneous participation in ""Good Will Hunting"" probably blew some of the wind out of this film's sails; in hindsight, ""The Rainmaker"" shines brightly, and includes some award-worthy work. The most obvious nomination for ""Supporting Actress"" would be veteran Teresa Wright's lovely swansong as ""Miss Birdie"" (it turned out to be the last of many great performances). Additionally, Mr. DeVito and Mr. Voight should have received some ""Supporting Actor"" consideration.The film features many strong characterizations, with Damon's lead providing perfect counterbalance. He, director Coppola, and novelist John Grisham are a formula worth repeating. Coppola manages to adapt Mr. Grisham's story successfully to film; and, he keeps the staid courtroom sequences exciting. The characters played by Claire Danes (Kelly Riker) and Johnny Whitworth (Donny Ray Black) seem lacking - an additional scene or two, with Damon, would have been nice. The film's thesis rings true, and is expertly concluded. Grisham, Coppola, and Damon are a winning firm. ********* The Rainmaker (11/18/97) Francis Ford Coppola ~ Matt Damon, Danny DeVito, Jon Voight, Teresa Wright",The Rainmaker
10,michaelRokeefe,Excellent courtroom drama.,7,4 January 2006,"One more lawyer in Memphis may be one lawyer too many. Francis Ford Coppola directs his screenplay based on John Grisham's novel. Rudy Baylor(Matt Damon)is a fresh new lawyer out of Memphis State University, who right out of the box takes on a powerful law firm representing an unethical and corrupt insurance company. Rudy first goes to work for a well known firm headed by a compromising ambulance chaser(Mickey Rourke)and then bolts with a 'paralawyer' and new partner(Danny DeVito)and takes on a monumental case representing a poor client against a large Cleveland insurance company that has denied the same legitimate claim eight times. Rudy goes up against a ruthless adversary Leo F. Drummond(Jon Voight). In spite of its two hour plus running time THE RAINMAKER is ambitious, powerful and a genuine 'pot boiler'.

12,Theo Robertson,When You`ve seen One Movie Adaptation ...,5,26 July 2004,"... Of a John Grisham novel you`ve seen them all and it`s impossible to say anything new about THE RAINMAKER since it`s already been said about every other "" Based on the novel by John Grisham "" movie This follows the formula very closely . A young idealistic lawyer played by an up and coming well buffed pretty boy actor starts work at a law firm whose somewhat shady and cynical characters are played by well known actors. The first half of the movie is taken up by subplots that show the young idealistic lawyer to be a great humanitarian always on the side of the underdog with the second half of the movie having thriller elements coming more and more to the fore .Honestly you could cut and paste the above paragraph for every review of a John Grisham adapatation and no one would notice . Having said all that THE RAINMAKER is entertaining even though you can easily spot the flaws like how on earth could Matt Damon`s hero pass his exams and go to the gym to get a body like that , and of course it`s just little overlong like all Grisham movies .

13,LeonLouisRicci,"Powerful Truths, Good Acting, & a Subtle Yet Compelling Script & Characters",8,18 January 2016,"One of those David and Goliath Courtroom Dramas where it is never in doubt Who Wears the Black Hats or the White Hats. But it's Ultimately a Dual Universe, so Everything Starts There and the Nuances Follow, or not.It Resonates, this kind of Story. Just ask John Grisham. So Mega-Director Coppola takes it on and gives it a Bare Bones, No-Frills account using a Talented Cast and relies on the Power of the Story and a Slice of Lower Class Displays.There are some Quirky Characters to be sure. Mickey Rourke as a Greedy and Slimy Lawyer who gives Matt Damon (The Moral Center) His first job working strictly on commission. Danny Devito may be the Quirkiest as a Paralegal (flunked the Bar six times) but provides the Humor in the Rather Depressing Reality of the Commonplace of the Corrupt. He uncouthly motormouths through the Film with a Complex Moral Code and lots of ChutzpahJon Voight is the Villain who is Eclipsed in Evil Doings by a Cameo from the CEO of the Insurance Company and is nothing more than the Now Idle Rich, with a complete lack of Empathy, that sowed His Evil Ways and found it Pays. Other Well Known Actors show up in some Well Drawn Roles.The Movie received mixed results from Critics and Audiences.

Interesting theme regarding dishonesty and truth among lawyers however, it is too predictable and structured like a courtroom drama. Director Frances Ford Coppola does his best but this hardly matches his work in The Godfather, The Conversation and Apocalypse Now. Damon is superb as this new attorney setting out to make a difference. De Vito steals scenes as he stoops to whatever level to achieve victory. Voight is standard issue as the opposing lawyer. Claire Danes is unnecessary as an abused housewife whose presence is basically to involve Damon in a romantic fling. It slows down an already boring film. Mickey Rourke also makes an appearance as a corrupt lawyer, as if that is beneath anybody here. Coppola is a terrific director doing work here that is far beneath him, with stars that are above it. It regards honest law but the screenplay evaporates like an ice cube in the mid day sun. Score: 4 / 10",The Rainmaker
16,HotToastyRag,Damon takes on the system,7,22 October 2021,"Calling all Matt Damon fans: if you want to see him as a noble lawyer fighting against the system, rent The Rainmaker. I rented it as a mistake; I thought it was a remake of the 1956 movie and couldn't imagine him in the larger-than-life Burt Lancaster role. But the two titles are completely unrelated. This one's more along the lines of Erin Brockovich, as a well-intentioned young lawyer takes on an evil insurance company taking advantage of poor people.My advice would be to watch the preview. It's a great representation of the film as a whole without giving away any plot points. It shows Matt Damon's introduction to law, his innocence, and his eventual decision to tangle with the scary bad guys, headed by Jon Voigt. There is some violence in this movie (after all, it's based on a John Grisham movie), but nothing gruesome. It's just an accurate representation of the how hard corrupt people will fight. There's also a bit of humor from Matt's mentor, Danny DeVito, and a bit of romance (for the girls in the audience) with Claire Danes. Keep your eyes open for Mickey Rourke, Mary Kay Place, Danny Glover, Roy Scheider, and two familiar faces that go all the way back to the silver screen: Teresa Wright and Dean Stockwell.",The Rainmaker
17,Wuchakk,'Good lawyer' is not an oxymoron,7,29 July 2018,"RELEASED IN 1997 and written & directed by Francis Ford Coppola based on John Grisham's book, ""The Rainmaker"" stars Matt Damon as an idealistic newbie lawyer in Memphis who takes on a fraudulent insurance company with Danny DeVito as his paralegal and Claire Danes an abused potential love interest. Jon Voight plays the lead lawyer for the insurance company and Roy Scheider the CEO of the corporation.Beyond Coppola's renowned expertise, the cast is stellar, which also includes Mickey Rourke as a smooth legal mogul, Virginia Madsen as a witness and Dean Stockwell & Danny Glover as judges. This was Damon's break out role as a leading man, paving the way for hits like ""Good Will Hunting"" (1998) and ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998). He's affable as the principled young lawyer and I liked the way the movie discreetly shows his new home life with the elderly lady, plus other budding relationships.This is decidedly a drama with many courtroom scenes, so don't except the thrills of other Grisham-based films, like the excellent ""The Firm"" (1993) and action-packed ""The Pelican Brief"" (1993), although there is an intense action sequence in the second half. While the first half confidently take its time with the drama, throwing in moments of realistic amusement, it segues into a compelling third act. Furthermore, ""The Rainmaker"" is a must for anyone interested in the good, the bad and the ugly of the legal arena in America.The movie made $46 million domestically from a budget of $40 million (not including revenue from other countries), but it was still considered a disappoint in comparison to ""The Firm,"" which cost roughly the same amount and made six times as much at the box office. Coppola subsequently took a decade break from directing before reentering the fray with the inscrutable ""Youth Without Youth"" (2007).THE FILM RUNS 2 hours, 15 minutes and was shot in the Memphis area of Tennessee, as well as Cleveland, Ohio and California (Alameda, Oakland, San Francisco).GRADE: B",The Rainmaker

19,SimonJack,Damon's star rises with Grisham's sixth crime drama film,8,17 April 2021,"""The Rainmaker"" is the sixth of John Grisham's novels to be made into a movie. And, along with ""Good Will Hunting"" less than two months later, it marked Matt Damon's rise as a top star. Damon is also a writer and won his only Oscar up to the 2020s for co-writing ""Good Will Hunting"" with Ben Affleck.Grisham was an attorney for a short time before he began writing novels in 1929. And after that first book, ""The Firm,"" and the hugely successful film that starred Tom Cruise, Grisham's name has been recognized around the world. As of 2020, his novels had sold more than 235 million copies. And all of the films made from his books have been highly successful. While he hasn't written just mysteries, his penchant and favorite plot is lawyers. They are young lawyers, many right out of law school, who face and deal with crime and corruption, and/or defend the little guys.The acting and performances are all very good in this film. Damon does a very good job portraying the young attorney, Rudy Baylor, who's green behind the ears about courtroom savvy and know-how. Jon Voight's performance as the opposing attorney earned him a Golden Globe nomination for best supporting actor. And Danny DeVito's Deck Shifflet is especially good.This is an entertaining crime drama in which the good side scores a hit, and a David brings down a Goliath. It doesn't have the mystery and intrigue of ""The Firm,"" or ""The Pelican Brief."" But, it's an entertaining film -- another one that might make an audience think that John Grisham had a real animus against the law profession. He clearly abhors its abuse by unscrupulous attorneys.Damon's Baylor has some humorous voice-over in one scene, about lawyer jokes. ""How do you know when a lawyer is lying? When his lips are moving... Everybody loves lawyer jokes - especially lawyers. They're even sort of proud of 'em.""This is a well-acted courtroom drama and coming out story of a young lawyer whose heart is soon won by common folk who are underdogs in the realms of commercial, corporate and criminal law. DeVito was deserving of a supporting actor nomination. His character has some of the best lines in the film.Deck Shefflit, ""There's nothing more thrilling than nailing an insurance company.""Shefflit, ""In law school, they don't teach ya what ya need to know. It's all theories and lofty notions and big fat text books."" Rudy Baylor, ""What's wrong with that?"" Shefflit, ""Nothing, I guess.""Shefflit, ""What they don't teach you in law school could get you hurt.""",The Rainmaker

21,MovieAddict2016,A good film with great performances,7,15 January 2006,"This was one of Matt Damon's early performances that really helped separate him from Affleck in the acting department. He plays Rudy Baylor, a law school student who (with the help of Danny DeVito's character) tries to take on the bad guys of conglomerate America.I read the novel by John Grisham, a writer who has never really impressed me very much in terms of characterization (if you'll notice all his protagonists are almost identical) but the movie has solid performances that help define everyone. Damon is impressive, and Mickey Rourke (in his third pairing with Francis Ford Coppola) turns in a short but memorable performance as a corrupt and ignorant man.Overall this may not be great but the performances are, and it was one of Coppola's few good films from the 1990s.",The Rainmaker

So he spends all his time prepping for a case that may not ever pay off. Shifflet (DeVito) tries to take him under his wing, but doesn't get why someone would ever take that case. Good supporting cast too: Roy Scheider, Claire Danes. Jon Voight is the lead attorney for the insurance company he's fighting. This was a couple years before erin brockovich, but some similarities. Big corporate company tries to duck out of taking responsibility, and ends up in court. Directed by the amazing F. F. Coppola; he had already won a TON of oscars by now. Novel by John Grisham. Can't go wrong starting with that. I'm really surprised that he has only won film festival awards for his work. This one is really good! Grisham had already had a couple books made into film by 1997.

23,Lejink,"Rain, rain go away",4,15 June 2014,"It seemed in the 90's that Hollywood was on a mission to film every book from the prolific pen of best-selling writer John Grisham. I've never read one of his books but having watched a few of the movie adaptations of his novels, I almost feel I could write one. All you need is an idealistic central lawyer, confront them with a big moral dilemma, close with a big courtroom scene and simmer but never quite bring to the boil.Matt Damon is the youthful unsullied hero here who belies his poor-boy background to try become a solicitor but who has to compromise his moral standards in starting up with a crooked ambulance-chasing litigation practice barely one step ahead of the law. There he's paired chalk and cheese-style with seen-it-all para-legal Danny De Vito and gets involved in not one but two cases which stretch his honesty and integrity to the max, one involving a law-suit against a mega-rich private medical insurance company denying a dying leukaemia victim his due pay-out and the other a cuddly old rich granny trying to stop her grasping kinfolk from getting her money when she expires. Along the way he also somehow manages to get romantically involved with a young battered wife.To be truthful, there's not much to get excited about here, the drama fails to grip as a thriller and the supposed feel-good sentimental climax underwhelms too.Damon and DeVito are okay in their stereotyped parts and Jon Voight gets to roll his eyes and chew the scenery as Mr Big Bad Corporate Lawyer. The only surprising thing about the whole movie in fact is the dull TV-movie type direction it gets from none other than Francis Ford Coppola. Either he was under strict instructions to film the book as written or he really has lost it since his 70's hey-day. This is not his finest hour by any manner of means.",The Rainmaker
24,paul2001sw-1,Not proven,7,24 July 2004,"Francis Ford Coppola used to make great films.  But little of his recent output can compare, and certainly not 'The Rainmaker', a by-the-book adaptation of a typical John Grisham courtroom thriller.  Grisham's greatest strength is that he actually makes the legal process seem interesting, but three-dimensionality is not necessarily his strong point, and the ending is disappointingly straightforward.  Rudi Baylor, the hero is this case, is a young, inexperienced, under-resourced, poor, idealistic lawyer fighting a just case against an evil corporation (and, just if we weren't convinced, saving an impossibly beautiful battered wife from her brutal husband at the same time).  It's a shame it's all so obvious, as there are some interesting ethical points here.  Baylor wants to fight for justice and lawyers who defend the wealthy and wicked come in for major criticism,and it's a real point that the richest can, up to a point, afford to buy the law. But the basis of an adversarial legal system is that both sides have the right to representation, and viewed from one perspective it's not a lawyer's job to pre-judge the case.  Also, with no-win, no-fee, a lawyer can get personally rich fighting the good fight, while other lawyers earn little giving the most despicable members of society the right to a fair hearing in court. The question of what makes a ""good"" lawyer, in moral terms, is hard to answer, but this film does not want to address these issues: even when Baylor calls on the skills of his criminal ex-boss, this is presented as a justified action, so clear is the merit of his case.  Sidney Lumet's 'The Verdict' is a far more ambiguous, and hence stronger, treatment of similar material; and besides, Paul Newman can act Matt Damon into the ground.  The verdict on 'The Rainmaker': watchable but unremarkable.",The Rainmaker
25,secondtake,"Routine underdog lawyer story, expensive and decent but nothing remarkable",7,28 July 2014,"The Rainmaker (1997)Stolid and solid, steady to the point of functional, and extremely mainstream. That is, here we have a somewhat sensational do-gooder kind of plot, taken from the Grisham novel, and a series of complications and good guys and bad guys fill it out. It's painfully predictable, and yet you are cheering for the underdog lawyers fighting the mean insurance industry and want to see how it ends. Even though it ends the way it has to.I love director Francis Ford Coppola's best movies. A lot. And I also wonder what goes on in his worst ones, where a personal indulgence gets in the way. Here I feel another thing kick in—mediocrity. Or fulfilling a contract. The filming is good of course, the mechanics of editing and acting are top notch. The music is a bit forced, however, and the pace is slower than necessary for the limited range of events that are shown. Matt Damon, years before his Jason Bourne stereotyping, is a recent law school grad who is instilled (according to a plain voice-over) with left-wing idealism. He falls into a shoe-string law firm with an oversized case. Classic David and Goliath. And of course he has setbacks and shows his naiveté, but perseveres, more or less, to the end (though the end itself you need to see for itself). Damon is very good. Jon Voight as the evil opposing attorney is even better, though with a more 2-dimensional role. What really pulls this movie into the mainstream in a kind of disappointing way is the way it is all told. It is what it is—well done but nothing more. It seems that the goal is to be convincing and entertaining. And so it is. Routinely. A simple comparison is ""Anatomy of a Murder"" which I guarantee Coppola saw before shooting this. The scenario is roughly similar—underdog lawyer against overpaid big shots, with a sidekick who does all the last minute investigative work. But Preminger (in this earlier film) had a whole bunch of things going for him that Coppola somehow skipped. First is an amazing rather than a decent leading actor (Jimmy Stewart). Second is a great score. Third is a plot that threw some real twists at you, including a defendant you didn't know whether to trust or not. Fourth you set it someplace really interesting, filled with quirks. And so on.So this movie, as solid (and stolid) as it is, just comes up short again and again. Enjoyable? Yes. As such!",The Rainmaker
26,A_Different_Drummer,Whole does not quite equal the sum of the parts...,7,3 August 2014,"Rated this a 7 of 10 because, in the great scheme of the movie universe, that is what it is. Especially notable -- and this where the magic comes from -- are the scenes where Damon finds his inner Jimmy Stewart and faces off against Jon Voight who, late in his career, morphed into one of the best movie ""bad guys"" of all time. These scenes, trust me, are to be savored because the rest of the movie is simply an exercise in what could have been. No less than the uncrowned King of film, Francis Ford Coppola, wrote (adapted) and directed. How common is that? This reviewer has seen the Godfather series AT LEAST 10 times and I would see it again tomorrow. Can't say that for Rainmaker. It just seems to diminish talent rather than enhance it. De Vitto's character never rises above caricature. Ditto for Claire Danes. Ditto for everyone else.

27,sol-,Coppola Meets Grisham,7,8 May 2016,"Not your average John Grisham adaptation, 'The Rainmaker' features many typical Grisham elements as the plot involves an idealistic young lawyer taking on a corrupt insurance company, however, the tone here is wildly different from the likes of 'A Time to Kill', 'The Client' and 'The Pelican Brief' in the best possible way. Francis Ford Coppola is at the screen-writing and directing reigns this time and he spins a frequently funny comedy from the source material, with a bouncy Elmer Bernstein score, an absolutely hilarious scene in which insurance company lawyer Jon Voight grills a jury member under false pretences and kooky supporting characters galore. Matt Damon is very decent in the lead role, but Danny De Vito as his partner, Teresa Wright as Damon's landlady (who wishes to leave everything in her will to a televangelist!) and Mickey Rourke as a rogue lawyer named Bruiser (!) steal every scene that they are in. The film is arguably a bit too complicated for its own good with subplots left, right and centre that sometimes distract from the insurance agency scam at the heart of the movie; Damon also drones on for a bit too long about morality. If flawed, 'The Rainmaker' is still a delightful film for the most part and the comedy slant really works for the better. It allows us to see the lighter side of the legal profession and some of the absurdities of the legal system without ever trivialising the ability of human perseverance to tackle and take on insurance scams - plus of course the power of one motivated individual to make a difference.",The Rainmaker
28,Rodrigo_Amaro,Someone or something is hiding this precious gem from the public's eyes!,10,10 July 2011,"I firmly believe in this statement since: how come an truly and realistic great film with an excellent cast, directed by one of the most respected film directors of all time, is barely mentioned by people, almost unknown to many film viewers and also (as for my country) never shown on TV? It was released in theaters here but for a short time. I've never heard of this film being on regular TV and not even in cable TV, and the closer I get of this film was seeing the DVD somewhere, and unfortunately I haven't bought it. And to found it on the internet was even the hardest task ever but it's certainly rewarding.I'm not much into conspiracy theories but I really think someone's hiding this film from viewers. Who could it be? Maybe Paramount itself, company that distributes this film isn't much interested in making it more available for exhibitions or selling. But the danger of ""The Rainmaker"" lies in a story about bringing risky and millionaire lawsuits against health insurance companies, and (here comes the conspiracy theory which I was referring), but maybe the real companies are paying Paramount to hide this film in the best possible way. The film remains criminally underrated despite having some favorable things about it.In ""The Rainmaker"", Matt Damon plays Rudy Baylor, an promising and idealistic young lawyer, graduated from Harvard, trying his way into the law business working in a revolting case against Great Benefit, an health insurance company that denied an bone marrow transplant of Donny Ray, a young man dying of leukemia, something that was covered in their policy. Baylor's test is not only in this trial, fighting against Leo F. Drummond (an impeccable and inspiring Jon Voight) and his team of lawyers defending Great Benefit but also in dealing with his boss (Mickey Rourke), involved in some illicit business; with his partner Deck (Danny DeVito) who'll be of great help in bringing testimonies for his case and showing how justice and law really works outside of what law schools teach; and a semi-romantic affair he has with Kelly (Claire Danes), victim of an abusive husband he mets. And believe me, the film never slows down its rhythm at any of these segments, they're all interesting.It's a story about a man fighting for what he believes in a troubled, dangerous, greedy and unethical world but he also needs to make some tricks in order to survive in this same world. His first client before Donny Ray's family is a guy involved in car accidents and who don't have a lawyer to represent them in legal assistance (but it's not something Rudy gets proud of). Rudy is also counts with luck to get things done, I mean, who could have thought that the original Judge selected for this case (and not much friendly with Rudy and his case) would collapse and die, being substituted by a more correct and friendly Judge (Danny Glover)? Like I said, all the segments were interestingly well made but the one that really captures all of our attention (and this is a must when it comes in films like these) is the whole trial. Here's an exciting, electrifying trial and obviously there's surprises (the appearance of a key witness, played by Virginia Madsen), twists and turns, some funny moments and the most interesting aspect of all, it shows how the legal system works, it digs deep into tiny little things that can make a huge difference between winning and losing a court battle.Despite this being directed by Francis Ford Coppola, in one of his attempts to pay for all the costs of the troubled and overbugeted ""One From the Heart"", which might sound like an film made for giving return in box-office less than being an intelligent and artistic film, ""The Rainmaker"" contains countless characteristics of his skillful direction, it's filmed and edited in a great style (one of those things that when you look back and watch the films made in the 1990's and then look at the ones made now, you feel the nostalgic feeling that, somehow, the films back then were better and this is a great example of that), followed by a nice soundtrack, and of course, the gigantic group of talented actors present here which also includes small appearances of Roy Scheider, Theresa Wright and Dean Stockwell, all in very good roles. Based on a John Grisham novel (he considers this his favorite film of all film adaptations of his work), this courtroom thriller is brilliantly memorable and it has one of the most original and realistic endings ever presented in films like these, it might look like an obvious cliché but then you have to wait to see more of what's about to come.

29,Dr_Coulardeau,A lasting masterpiece of before Obamacare,10,6 August 2010,"Coppola can really deal with delicate subjects and make them palatable. Here he deals essentially with insurance companies that « levy » money from the poor and always deny their claims, or nearly, because these poor will not know how to get or to afford a lawyer. We are here obviously before Obamacare.The case is overdramatic: a young man who dies of leukemia because his insurance comparny denies him the most advanced forms of medicine under the pretext that they are experimental. Of course what is to happen happens. No question about the end of the film. We know it from the very start.But the film shows many details all along. Rotten lawyers who prefer a deal rather than a court case. Corporate lawyers who are ready to do anything to justify even the worst crimes of their corporations. Judges who have aged in the « pulpit » and want to get rid of as many cases as possible without long court proceedings.It also shows the tricks and the traps of the business : bugs (mikes of course), and how you trap these crooked lawyers with fake phonecalls, hidden documents, fired personnel under contracts that deny them the right to speak, even in court, blackmailing at times, menaces and violence, and so many other elements.It does not reassure us about justice since to win is the result of a game and if you do not have the best lawyer and a lot of money, you will never win. And even when you win, you lose in the end because the loser appeals the decision or just goes bankrupt when it is a corporation that can disappear under one identity and reappear under another practically overnight.In other words a deeply pessimistic film, even if the future can become better only if these battles are fought and won, even if the victory is transformed into a defeat in the short-run, because in the long-run the victory will be recognized and imposed.But that is not all we can and have to say.One more legal thriller, you will say. Yes and no. Yes, because it is a thriller in the courtroom with a judge and lawyers and cases, victims and culprits, a jury and all of it. But it is more than that. It is the dilemma of a young lawyer who is confronted to an impossible choice: he is getting involved with his clients, emotionally involved and that is not good. You can't be the lawyer of the woman you love. You can't be the lawyer of a young man who is dying of leukemia and for whom you feel too much compassion.But that problem is secondary in that film, though it explains the end, the very final scene.This film is essential because it deals with three cases that are absolutely typical in our society. The first case is an old woman who has an important inheritance and she does not want to give it to her own son and his wife because they hate her and they only want her money. That's about what we do with our senior citizens, and what they do with themselves if they still have that much control of their future. Then let the lawyer write the will.Then you have a young married woman who is systematically beaten up by her husband and she does not dare to get a divorce because she is afraid. Then the lawyer is the only recourse to convince her she has to put an end to that situation and she sure puts an end to the situation, radical in self-defense one night when the violence becomes extreme.Then there is the central case, that of the young man dying of leukemia because his insurance company denied the claim. In that case, and that film is not quite young, we have all the arguments we have been able to hear against any kind of public management of health insurance coverage. That case was representative of the debate that had been going on for decades, since the war, since the new bill of rights of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944. Public health is a national asset and the nation through its representatives is entitled to manage it for everyone to have access to the best health coverage possible.Along that line the film is extremely emotional, even passionate, and the arguments are no longer important when you are dealing with the pictures of a dying young man, of a beaten young woman, of an old hated woman. But the film is effective and calls for a response from the audience. It is that direct address to the audience's feelings and emotions, other than fear, fright and dread, or horror, terror and phobia, or violence, brutality and fury, that make the film interesting and probably lasting.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",The Rainmaker

The film is based upon a best-selling novel by John Grisham, and strangely, nowhere in the film is there any explanation of the meaning of the title, which I presume must have been clear in the original book. The screenplay is by the director, Francis Ford Coppola. I believe it is one of his finest films. Coppola has always been a good screenwriter, and he has crafted a fine screenplay and directed it magnificently. John Toll's cinematography is as usual excellent. The film is notable in retrospect for the appearance of the 18 year-old Claire Danes, long before HOMELAND had ever been dreamt of. She was pretty and talented then, as well as now. The film was also the occasion for the last film appearance by Teresa Wright, bringing to a close 56 years of inspired screen acting. The lead role of the young lawyer who decides he is going to fight corruption is played by Mark Damon, who really is a very fine actor when he is not too busy leaping from rooftops and helicopters in those endless Bourne action movies. The film is a powerful and gripping 'David and Goliath' story, with Matt Damon fighting the forces of corporate evil against all the odds. Jon Voigt is magnificent, giving one of his finest film performances, as the oily lead lawyer of a corrupt insurance company. Danny DeVito is marvellous as a legal assistant who bends all the rules to 'get' the bad guys. This film is, as I have said, more relevant now than when it was made. In the light of the Obamacare train crash, and the loss of insurance cover for millions of people through the sheer idiocy and perversity of the Obamacarrions, this film speaks of yet another angle on the desperate problems of people being deprived of their insurance and left helpless as they lie dying of fatal diseases, with their deaths hastened by the lack of treatments which could save them.",The Rainmaker

And it was very interesting seeing Teresa Wright, the teenage star of Hitchcock's ""Shadow of a Doubt"" as the elderly Miss Birdie. The film's ending seemed like it just ran out of steam, though.

I think part of the problem with this film is that it sometimes lacks focus; the interesting part of the film is the main plot involving Baylor and Shifflet trying to take down Great Benefit, but the film has a sub-plot involving Baylor trying to protect Kelly Riker (Claire Danes) whom is a victim of domestic abuse. Whilst the sub-plot is quite touching and does help to endear us towards Rudy it ultimately feels unnecessary and seems like it's been tagged on just to create a love interest for Rudy. The very fact that it is completely unrelated to the rest of the story only reinforces this point, and at times it means that the film lacks focus and feels longer than necessary. The oddities in this film continue when we're introduced to Bruiser (Micky Rourke whom it took me a while to recognise to be honest). He's introduced early on and seems important to the story, but then disappears from the film with very little explanation??? Hmm... just seemed a bit strange to me.That being said, once we get to the meat of the film (the courtroom drama aspect) then it does become very enjoyable and this is the side of the film that makes it worth seeing. The performances from the main cast are all excellent; Damon is very convincing as a wet-behind-the ears laywer (he's actually almost too convincing). DeVito is OK, but Voight and Glover are both excellent - Glover in particular looks like he is having a lot of fun here.The Rainmaker is a bit of a plodder in its early stages and there are certainly aspects of it that don't really work, but the courtroom scenes in the second half of the film more than compensate for the shortcomings of the first half and the strong second half makes it worth the effort.",The Rainmaker
34,juneebuggy,Pretty great courtroom drama; gripping story and characters I genuinely cared about,8,22 March 2015,"This was really good, and I'm not usually one for the courtroom dramas but a gripping story (thanks to John Grisham) and filled with fantastic characters I genuinely liked and cared about.Matt Damon plays newbie attorney Rudy Baylor, who after a short stint working for the ethically challenged (Mickey Rourke) joins his new partner (Danny DeVito) to take on a large insurance company (Jon Voight & Roy Scheider) who refuse to pay valid claims. Damon is young, cute and ripped here (for some reason his weight changes with every movie he makes so I felt it deserved a mention) Anyways, the cast is fantastic and I loved that there were several story lines going on at once, all of which are interesting. This has moments of humour and honest emotion throughout even if it did head into the melodramatic a couple of times.Watching 'Rudy' struggle through his first days in court not really knowing the protocol was pretty funny and I enjoyed Danny Glover as the judge. The storyline following Claire Danes and her abusive husband was intense (lots of glass broken) and I liked his old lady landlord Birdie, who treated Rudy like a son and the gardener.Rudy genuinely cares about his clients and his relationship with leukemia boy was touching (in an 'Erin Brockovich' sort of way) while the inclusion of the silent grieving father, was powerful. Just a great movie I'm glad I caught. 1/28/15",The Rainmaker
35,Enchorde,"Surprisingly good, but do not forget the book",7,1 August 2004,"** Here might be spoilers **Young lawyer-student Rudy Baylor about to become a real lawyer gets involved with some shady businessmen and involved in a case with some rather poor parents fighting an insurance company, over the treatment and insurance claim of their fatally ill son. The inexperienced lawyer (Damon) get help from a not-really-lawyer Deck Shifflet (DeVito) that is more accustomed to the brutal war that is trial. Together they fight experienced top lawyers and the system on the edge of the law. To complicate matters more Baylor get involved with the drafting of a will of his landlord and a young beautiful girl, beaten up by an abusive dangerous husband.Now, one should remember that movies and books are completely different medias, so that a story told in a book are impossible to tell in a movie without some changes and cuts. That is the ground rules when adapting a book to movie. In many cases the story get hampered and incomplete in the movie-version but this is not so in this case. Of course, there are some big time cutting in the story, mainly in background descriptions and subplots that are not essential to the main story. However, the writers and directors have still managed to capture the essence of the story while managing to both keep major subplots and not do an movie that go on forever. By some quick scenes, cuts and hints the audience is easily able to put together a complete and fascinating story. Nice work.The story in itself is a version of the classic little guy from nowhere fighting the big system that keep to protect themselves and their profits no matter what. It is a long struggle for poor Baylor but the journey is eventful and entertaining to follow, as new turns and subplots appear and resolve. Damon does an good but not great work with his character, DeVito instead does a really good job with his slightly minor role as Shillet. Th opposition is lead by a Drummond, which Voight portraits with skill even if he as Damon does not bring the performance to any great heights. The real credit here should go to the people in charge of casting along with the director. Damon as Baylor, Voight as Drummond, Danes as Kelly Riker (the beaten girl) and Whitworth (as Donnie Ray Black, the sick son) is very good choices for those characters, both in physical appearances and acting performances. Even Danny Glover (uncredited?) does a nice role (without sending out any Lethal Weapon wibes, nice) out of the presiding judge (a role rather cut in the movie compared to the book). The ace is however DeVito as Shillet. Perfect choice.So, if you like criminal drama, with some traces of action and comedy, this is a movie for you. And if you like the movie and haven't read the book, I strongly recommend that you do so as the story will evolve even more. And if you have read the book but not seen the movie, do not be afraid to do so, you will not be disappointed (even if some surprises might already be known to you). Enjoy the nice acting instead.7/10",The Rainmaker
36,Boyo-2,Absorbing drama,8,11 February 1999,"This movie is very well cast and always interesting and thoughtful, despite its length.

There is nothing special or new in this movie, but under the care of Coppola, it's all fascinating.",The Rainmaker
37,ShootingShark,Just Another Shark In The Dirty Water,5,10 June 2011,"Rudy Baylor is a greenhorn lawyer in Memphis who lands a sensational case - a young man dying of leukaemia whose insurance company refuses to pay out. Can inexperienced Rudy take on the fat cat corporate sharks and dish out some justice ?This is a polished, well made, well acted courtroom drama from a bestselling novel by John Grisham, whose legal thrillers were very popular in the nineties (The Firm, The Pelican Brief, The Client). I'm afraid however I don't think much of the plot - greedy insurance company versus terminally ill kid coughing up blood is a bit too hackneyed for me, and when it throws in fisticuffs with the jury, company documents with mysterious missing bits, and last minute witnesses having affairs with the defendants, my Credibility Proximity Warning lights start to flash. It also has a lengthy subplot involving a battered wife which is touching but has precisely zero relevance. In my view, stories should be tight, focused and original, and I'm not convinced Grisham's are. That said the characters are rich and the drama has some good points to make about the legal exploitation of the US working class, as well as many funny scenes, like the one where DeVito walks down to the hospital and presses his card into the hands of patients in traction. Its strongest suit is the cast - Damon is suitably bewildered and well-intentioned, DeVito holds everything together as the shyster evidence man, Voight is toothy and evil as the corporate pit bull, an unbilled Glover is the judge, Madsen (Dune, Candyman) has an eye-catching part as a bitter and sullied ex-executive, the late great Scheider shows up at the end as the CEO, and Coppola alumni Rourke and Stockwell shine in off-the-wall parts as a mumbling one-step-away-from-prison legal embezzler and a bad-tempered emphysemic judge with a very short life expectancy respectively. The batty old bird is played by Teresa Wright, the young star of several forties classics (such as Hitchcock's Shadow Of A Doubt), aged seventy-seven and making her final film, and West in the small part of the Dad shows how it's possible to create a thought-provoking and fully-fledged character with literally no dialogue. They're all fun to watch strutting their stuff and riffing off each other. In the end though, this is a disappointing movie for me, purely because its scope falls well short of its director's talent. It's a good movie, but it's a safe movie - it looks familiar, it makes you smile and gasp at all the right points, and the heroes win. What makes Coppola's movies great is when he doesn't make them safe. Most people would say this is a better film than One From The Heart, but not me - while that movie may have its flaws too, it's completely original and unlike anything else; it's an artist putting himself on the line (and in that instance getting savaged for it) but injecting his soul into his art. The Rainmaker is a solid bet, an agreeable thriller, but unlike its director it's nothing special.",The Rainmaker

39,triple8,Quietly powerful,8,20 May 2005,"SPOILERS THROUGHOUT POST: Rainmaker is a movie that's more a quiet and sedate telling of a story then a flashy action oriented mystery or a dramatic courtroom drama. A lot of it takes place in a courtroom to be sure and it's focus is lawyers but more then anything else, it seems it's purpose is to engross and draw you in, and that's done by telling the story of the characters themselves rather then manufacturing false tension. I really liked this movie a lot and found it to be a must see for any fan of (for lack of a better term) movies about lawyers and Courtrooms.The way Rainmaker plays out, your not ever bored and are interested from the beginning in the lives of the main characters. Damon was the perfect choice for the role of idealistic lawyer, I liked how the movie was able to show the humility of many of these people in a way that never seemed contrived and always remained interesting. The casting choices were close to perfect and everyone from Damon to Devito to Voight and Danes were great. So were the supporting cast, Marykay Place, Virginia Madson, I could go on. The movie, even though it had a lot of big names in it, never seemed all that commercial. Although Damon's character was so likable you could really see where his character could have his own television show....Although the subplot with Claire Danes was good, it was overshadowed by the insurance company story. That's not the fault of Danes who is great in everything I've seen her in, but her story is not given as much screen time and builds to quickly but then again had the whole movie just dealt with that one case with the insurance company that might have been just to much.Rainmaker's strength was not selling out in a sense. Even the ending made sense, because while Damon won his case, the company went belly up etc etc. It didn't just end with the jury coming in and rendering a verdict. And the narrating went well with this also, because even though I don't always like that in a movie, it fit here and was done very well by Damon.I'd give this movie a solid 8 of 10. It was quietly powerful. And it was very good.",The Rainmaker
40,Movie-ManDan,A Great Look At The Law.,7,18 December 2014,"Most good courtroom dramas and legal movies deal with murder. Those are just simply the most fun ones to see. The ones that do not deal with murder have to be extra great for everybody to like it. This is one that is simply that good without the need of murder. This is based on the 1995 novel by John Grisham of the same name. I'll have to admit, I did not like the novel. It was too boring with too many subplots and just dragged on about nothing. What Grisham bored me with, Coppola condenses in a way that I wish Grisham wrote in the first place.This features a star-studded cast (Matt Damon, Claire Daines, Danny DeVito, Jon Voigt, Danny Glover, Teresa Wright, Mickey Rourke, Roy Scheider) that is bound to make this movie that much more enjoyable. The movie is about recent law-school grad, Rudy Baylor (Damon) who is assigned to a case involving a poor family suing a wealthy insurance company for not paying for their son's cancer treatments. The company hires a high-power law firm with years of experience with very little losses. Rudy has never even been involved in a case before. At first, the lawyers make him look bad. Then Rudy slowly turns the tables on them as he shows what the company has really been up to. That is what makes the courtroom portion so interesting. A youth fresh of of school successfully files a lawsuit in such an exciting and believable way. But it is not realistic how he is assigned a high-profile case right off the bat. In reality, Rudy would have to work for years near the bottom of a firm and slowly get to the position he is at in the film.This is not as good as most of Coppola's other movies and not 1997's best. The acting and everything might be good, but a big chunk of the movie is so gloomy and dull. But it is better than the book. Luckily, it is one of those that gets better as the minutes go. Bit by bit, the case gets more complex and Rudy tries to save the life of a woman (Daines) who's in a stormy relationship with her husband, all which make the movie a very fine watch.3/4",The Rainmaker
41,raulfaust,Arab invisible money,7,26 June 2014,"Well, I'm a law school student in the last year of graduation, who has been approved in the bar exam (it has another name in Brazil), so it's evident that I feel much connected with Rudy Baylor. The movie is centered on the difficulties this young lawyer has to face to get things done. He has to avoid speaking on the phone in his own office in order to not fall in a trap from the adversary attorney. What amazes me about this film is that, even thought there were thousand of courtroom dramas in the nineties, ""The Rainmaker"" was able to show a story not so clichéd, like the innocent who goes to prison due to a conspiracy-- which would feel extremely cliché nowadays. Also, the entire cast looks prepared for their work in here; Danny DeVito, in fact, almost steals the show with his brilliant performance as a paralegal-- who acts like a lawyer sometimes, even if that's illegal. Furthermore, albeit the movie takes more than two hours to tell a story, it never feels tiring or repetitive, which is common in the genre. The problem involving health insurance companies is still very common, inclusive in Brazil, and we are all tired of seeing such lack of respect with the consumer. I'm just not giving it a better rating because the subplot involving a beaten-up woman didn't feel pertinent with the movie as a whole. I mean, if director/editor decided to take those scenes off, they would make NO difference to the main plot, so I sometimes wondered what was that all about. All in all, ""The Rainmaker"" is a decent production from the good decade that nineties was in movies, and I surely recommend it for anyone who enjoys the genre!",The Rainmaker
42,screenman,A Spoiled Treasure.,6,6 July 2008,"If you read the quotation attributed to Rudy Baylor amongst the 'Trivia' and 'Fun Stuff', you will see a generalisation about domestic violence. It is this quite needless implicit misogyny that spoils the movie for me.Matt Damon is excellent as the law graduate looking for a first break. The best that he can find is a dubious sleaze-ball on the threshold of criminality, played by Mickey Rourke. This man retains a gofer called Deck Shifflet, played with scene-stealing slyness by Danny DeVito. Damon's novice is introduced to the fine art of ambulance chasing and any other vulturesgue legal shenanigans that will turn a fast buck. They're not what he had in mind.In between a dotty old dowager's will and her grasping family, he picks up on a young man dying from some wasting disease and an insurance company that won't take up his medical expenses. Cue, a megabuck lawsuit: The titular Rainmaker.The whole thing is directed and acted with commendable panache. And there's a script to do it ample justice.At the same time, Rudy encounters a battered young wife at a hospital, and the presumption of institutionalised male violence is both irritating and plain wrong. The facts prove that most domestic violence is instigated by females, not males. But males being bigger and stronger and inherently more violent, usually suffer the least physically. Whereas contrariwise; females invariably come off worst. And it shows.Clearly, domestic disputes are the small change of common law at the poorer end of any legal profession, and someone in Rudy's position would almost certainly encounter cases. What I find irritating is the unquestioning stereotypic presumption of male guilt. It's a point needlessly emphasised by the wife's childish and demure persona, against the husband's 'raging bull' excess. They are almost a cliché in themselves. The interpretation is, of course, politically correct. Feminists have been blighting the good name of males for decades. It is a lie that, having been told often enough and loudly enough, has become truth. It's just a shame that the genuine complexities of fractured relationships are over-simplified to appease this supposed common denominator. Doubters should study the findings of feminist, Erin Pizzey, who established the first refuge In England for battered women.In fact, the subtler bi-line here is that, having made an unsatisfactory choice, this young woman merely waited for some more eligible male to seduce. And what better than a sentimental, idealistic, up-and-coming young lawyer? He would be manipulated into defending her cause like a knight-errant, and compete for her charms with the unsatisfactory husband. Females have been playing males off against each other in just this way for millions of years. That's precisely why we ARE bigger and stronger than the opposite sex. Males have been genetically engineered to prove their breeding potential by fighting each other. Read Darwin's 'Descent Of Man'; it's all in there. Her motive behind the tantalizing cinema liaison couldn't have been more obvious. And Rudy was like putty in her hands, obsessing over her all the way home. Ultimately our young hero is drawn towards a fatal confrontation. It is one in which he himself is beguiled into criminal activity. After Rudy beats the husband senseless, this wife persuades him to leave. His voice-over states 'she knew exactly what to do'. And we hear her off-camera administering the final coup-de-grace to her now-disabled husband by means of his own baseball bat. A potential case of murder. Rudy's voice-over goes on: 'even then she was only thinking of me'. Yes; but not in the way he supposed. It would hardly have served her purpose to have her new champion and his prospects compromised by criminal charges. He was, after all, the next meal-ticket - something later emphasised when the enormous potential of the insurance lawsuit becomes clear. 'How much of that will you get?' she asks. Unwittingly, Rudy responds; 'Well, you get right down to it, don't you?' It's a joke. But actually, it isn't (not to her).So he fled the scene of a killing in which he conspired, that might at least be construed as manslaughter, withheld material evidence and testimony from the the police, and later manifest a blatant conflict of interests by legally representing the young widow. Not exactly the moral high-ground to which he once aspired. Even Mickey Rourke's 'Bruiser' character didn't participate in a killing.As I say, this is a well cast movie that is for the most part warm and tenderly played. But this gross-on piece of anti-male propaganda sticks like a frog in the throat. I'd give it 9 stars otherwise.",The Rainmaker

44,bobsgrock,"Fresh, entertaining, purely for fun.",8,12 December 2009,"There are times when it may feel that this adaptation of The Rainmaker is stretching the reality and coherence of this story of a first-time lawyer taking on a powerful law firm representing a corrupt insurance company, but those instances are few and far between. For the most part, we get some really strong acting from a marvelously talented cast and a strong script from director Francis Ford Coppola.What Coppola does here with John Grisham's famous insight on the United States law and judicial branch is for the most part make it a very entertaining picture. I was surprised at how excited and caught up I was in this film, with the characters and the events they found themselves in. Matt Damon, Claire Danes, Danny DeVito, and Jon Voight all have their time on screen and they all make the most of it. I also loved how Coppola chose not to focus on just one aspect of Grisham's narrative, but rather included all of it. This main character doesn't just have one client, but several and although the film focuses on the big one mainly, we still get to see what happens in all cases.As someone who has had first-hand experience with juries and courtrooms, I can honestly say this was probably the best interpretation of all the situations and policies in which they use in real life. That makes this more fun to watch as you start thinking about your own time in these situations. As a film, the acting carries it very far, the writing is a solid foundation and the music is funky and gives it a different context. I can honestly say this is one of Coppola's most honorable achievements. He manages to capture the spirit of Grisham the author and Grisham the critic of the judicial system. It all blends well together and we are left with a very entertaining piece of story.",The Rainmaker
45,film-critic,Just pray you don't get jury duty on this film...,2,30 August 2009,"John Grisham has proved himself to be the literary lawyer. His books open the courtrooms to the masses, and allow the underdog to rule the day. With that said, not every Grisham novel is best told in the cinematic language. From ""The Firm"" to ""A Time to Kill"" and now to ""The Rainmaker"" directors and studios have tried to bring the elaborately well written stories to the screen with the same panache and excitement that is in the binded world – and yet every time, they fail. The films are entertaining, but after one viewing – the ability to view a repeat performance has lost momentum. Recently, ""The Rainmaker"" came across my DVD player, and I was forced to endure a repetitive story, one-dimensional characters, and a predictable ending that left me gasping for some originality. One must admit that Francis Ford Coppola does attempt to bring a level of authenticity to the screen, but it is the mediocre Matt Damon and the always odd Danny DeVito that force this film to flounder. Also, condensing a 443-page book into just over two hours is difficult. There is quite a bit lost within the translation, and ""The Rainmaker"" is no exception. From the lacking cardboard-esquire relationship between Damon and Claire Danes all the way to the less-than-exciting courtroom element, ""The Rainmaker"" struggles to hold on, and after 12 years, it just doesn't remain as pivotal as it once, perhaps, was.Re-watching this film for the first time in ten years, I wasn't expecting Oscar-caliber performances, nor was I walking in with great unrealistic hopes – which may be the reason it didn't further my desire to watch more Grisham adaptations. All I wanted from this film was an enjoyable two hours, but even that was a struggle. The beginning struggle with ""The Rainmaker"" comes from Coppola's choice of pacing. There is quite a bit of down time with this film, where we (as audience members) are merely watching small, unimportant character development that led nowhere. Damon cutting grass, hanging out in a hospital, asleep at his desk, or late for his most important case ever – are all within this film, but edited stronger – leaving these small unneeded bits out – would have tightened this story further. Coppola feels as if he has more information than this film can process within the time allowed. This hurts not only the film as a whole, but the individual parts (i.e. the characters, the tone, and the intended drama) as well. Because the editing was loose, we are lost when Damon heads to help his questionable love interest Claire Danes. We are lost as to the direction of Damon's relationship with ""Bruiser"". We are lost as to the focus of DeVito's character, who represents himself as smarter than Coppola gives him credit for. So, to add to the mix of disheveled actors this plot that fails because of the lack of editing and character development, we have a sloppy film that is liked by too many.Plot. Aristotle said ""plot matters"", and it should be believed that those involved with ""The Rainmaker"" should have paid further attention to this decree. ""The Rainmaker"" is a film about a newbie lawyer taking his first big case which is in essence the simplistic story of big business versus the little poverty of America. It is a strong beginning, but we loose focus when we add other elements that are never fully explained. Is Danes really in love with Damon who is portrayed as someone merely eager to help her, not fall in love? How influential was ""Bruiser"" to Damon's upbringing as a lawyer? Did anyone else believe that when Danny Glover was introduced as the sympathetic judge that this case was predetermined? Wouldn't anyone notice DeVito wasn't a lawyer – as smart as the defense was? Voight was slimy, but was it just his accent that made him that way? Then, we have the utterly realistic, but completely misplaced ending that felt cheap instead of honest. There was supposed to be emotion from the family who suffered the loss, but we are left with such little time dedicated to either side, that we just feel bored. Not a tear was struck with the emotion pulled out at the end, and I think that is an indication of how poorly Coppola directed this film.Overall, ""The Rainmaker"" leaves you with further disappointment than originally thought. A courtroom drama is always worth at least one slick move, at least one important cameo, and one highly emotional scene that leaves you with the impression of how good these lawyers and genre's can be. ""The Rainmaker"" had none of these. Scaling this film among those like ""A Few Good Men"" or even Grisham's ""The Firm"", it falls well below. If you walk in with no expectations, than perhaps this film will uplift your spirits. Alas, for me – there was just a lacking plot, a terrible edit, and wafer-esquire characters that hurt the determined tone of this film. It was an embarrassing outing for Coppola as a director, but also the courtroom drama genre. There are better films that fit the bill out there, avoid this one.Grade: ** out of *****",The Rainmaker

47,Movie-12,A fresh feeling entree to a tired gender. *** out of ****,7,3 October 1999,"THE RAINMAKER (1997) ***Starring: Matt Damon, Danny DeVito, Claire Danes, Jon Voight, and Danny Glover Director: Francis Coppola   135 minutes   Rated PG-13 (for violence, thematic elements and some language)By Blake French:""The Rainmaker"" is not your typical courtroom drama. It uses different techniques to bring upon compelling material in an audience. These techniques are fresh and entertaining, but do not necessarily allow this film to have the chance to be a standout movie in its gender. So there you have it, an avowed overview of the content of this review: a film that stands as good, but is still nothing to get exited about.
The picture stars Matt Damon as Rudy Baylor, a novice lawyer who has just recently finished  law school. His character narrates the film, and at times, explains a little too much of the story to us. He has chosen to become a lawyer not because of his father, who used to beat him and his mother up, but because it has been his lifelong dream to become one. In fact, he is so desperate for work, Rudy excepts a job from a corporate fraud in which the only other standing attorney in his firm is a short and suspicious man named Deck Schifflet. The two of them soon become partners forming their own independent law firm with next to zero cash in hand. The next step in forming an attorney? Finding a client. And that is exactly what Rudy and Deck intend to do. The two of them stumble opon an insurance company scandal featuring a young man dying of a curable disease, with his parent's near bankruptcy restricting him from receiving treatment. Rudy claim's the insurance company refused to pay them medical insurance. The company claims it was all a misunderstanding. The fat cat lawyer in charge of the defense is Leo F. Drummond, who is played perfectly by Jon Voight, who has about a dozen other powerful attorney's representing his client as well. During a particularly effective scene where the two opposing sides meet to discuss matters at banquette room, we see the prosecution in the hands of inexperienced Rudy alone, representing an underdog in over his head. While the defense side represents ignorance and experienced power by expressing many experienced and mighty lawyers. This scene serves as a golden moment in the film.
The film offers a good, constant point of view through Damon's position. Before the movie is over, he'll induce a love story that belongs in a different film. In it he helps eliminate the troubles of a young woman. Even as this romantic subplot distracts our attention away from our main focus, the big trial case of insurance fraud, the movie manages, through a distinct view point, to overcome this problem and turn it into something engaging. Matt Damon is a little shaky in his leading role here. But then again, under the circumstances, his character should be a little on the nervous side.The success of ""The Rainmaker' is backed up with a cast of confidence. As I've already said, Damon is somewhat iffy in his role, but Danny DeVito, his accomplice, offers hilarity and relief. Young actress Claire Danes is at home here as well, appropriately portraying her character with confusion and hardship. Veteran actor Jon Voight offers just the right amount of overpowering material to allow his character to challenge the audience. And even the minor role from Danny Glover, as the main judge, has some fun with his character. Overall, ""The Rainmaker"" covers fresh ground in its gender of trial dramas. It has a lot of fun with its plot, and is held together with consistency and a firm structure. The story is at first a bit unconvincing, but before the end of the production, it is as involving as ""A Civil Action"" (1998), or even ""Night Falls on Manhattan,"" (1997). Although clearly not as good as that film, or many others, it is still a prevailing attempt at an overly familiar subject.Brought to you by Paramount Pictures and Constellation Films.",The Rainmaker
48,SKG-2,Grisham's best novel becomes only okay movie,7,26 February 1999,"Call it a guilty pleasure, but I'm a fan of the novels of John Grisham. Sure, they're the literary equivalent of junk food, but they're enjoyable junk food, and since this is my favorite of his novels, I was looking forward to the movie.  I must say, though, it's somewhat disappointing.  The humor comes through very well, especially when Danny DeVito or Mickey Rourke are on screen.  And Claire Danes, as usual, is appealing.  But the narration written by Michael Herr (who did a much better job with the narration to APOCALYPSE NOW) is totally unnecessary.  Someone I used to know a few years ago had a term for movies like this; ""Narration from Hell"" movies.  Damon suffered similarly in 1993's GERONIMO.The other problem I had is how the case was presented.  In the novel, it was pretty much of cakewalk (though this isn't a suspense novel, so that isn't necessary), so Coppola decided not to make it so easy.  That's fine.  What isn't is when the jury in the movie is not presented with the same set of facts as they are in the novel (or in the movie, either the judge played by Danny Glover or the prosecutor played by Jon Voight are able to cloud them), and yet present the same verdict.  In the novel, it was maybe not realistic, but it was plausible, but here, it isn't.",The Rainmaker

Stone is an ambulance chaser, who does whatever it takes, legal or not, to win a case. Rudy, as most law students are when they graduate, wants to take the high road, do everything by the book, and win. What he finds is that sometimes you need to get down and dirty to help your client. In this case, his client is a young boy, dying of leukemia. Seems the insurance company won't pay for a bone marrow transplant that would save his life. Rudy sets out to help the young man and his family, in what turns out to be one of the biggest cases Tennessee has ever seen. Along with his partner Deck Shifflet (Danny DeVito), Rudy sets out to try and prove to the world that the insurance company is nothing more than a big time scam artist. Along the way Rudy meets (and falls in love with) a young woman (Clare Danes) who gets beat up regularly by her husband. This part of the story seemed somewhat strange to me. I couldn't figure out what it was there to do. Was it to give Rudy a love interest? Was it just to give the movie another case so the entire film wasn't centered on the insurance trial? I feel it gave the movie some heart, and showed that Rudy would fight for what he believed in, both in court and in life. But I think the movie could have been done without it. I enjoyed the trial scenes and all the grunt work that went behind it (being a future lawyer myself (I hope)). And the cast was wonderful. Each person added a little more to the movie, and each gave a great performance. Danny Glover as the (2nd) judge gave a little humor to the movie, but also made you feel good about Rudy's chances in court. He was going to play fair, but hew as also going to give Rudy the benefit of the doubt. Jon Voight played the insurance company's lead lawyer, and he played his character to it's swarmy best. He is what people think lawyers are like, out only for money; win at all costs, no soul (I know attorneys like that). And he was convincing. And of course DeVito and Damon carried the film. I had my doubts about Damon playing a lawyer, but the more I watched, the more I realized that he looked like people I see at work everyday. He had the same fear in his eyes that we all do, but also that dog-eat-dog determination to prove to the world that he could do the job. The Rainmaker was more about the performances than the story. And the performances won me over. Give it a shot, it's worth it.",The Rainmaker

The Rainmaker is a very good story about a newly qualified lawyer who takes on a multi-billion insurance company for the family of a young man dying of leukaemia. Exciting stuff with a pleasing if slightly simplified end, but a entertaining law-procedural plot. Enter, the amazing acting talent of Matt Damon. He was excellent in this film, measured, quietly strong and believable up against the arrogance of his opposite number Jon Voight for the Insurance Company. Also, Danny DeVito was good, and he and Damon seemed to work well together. Some of the make up special effects were a little poor. Aside from the main characters, some of the acting wasn't deep or developed enough but were generally good but the actual production of the film was lacking something. The sound quality was bad, there seems to be pauses in the action, and some continuity and pacing issues. The film feels amateurish and low budget. Coppola, who directed, clearly wanted a grim and grey feel to the film, which I think he achieved but it didn't make it look that good. However, it is Damon and DeVito and the story that carries this film and that is what you are invested in with a John Grisham film. Definitely highly entertaining.",The Rainmaker

The movie concentrates on the main plot, but in Grisham's novel the plot is not as important as the character descriptions and the feelings of Rudy Baylor. Francis Ford Coppola tried his very best and I must admit that it could have been worse, but generally I think it would have been better not to film the novel at all.

The cases vary from an old woman who is unsure about what to do with some money, a savagely abused domestic victim, and a lawsuit involving a major health insurance company.Writer-director Francis Ford Coppola and one of his writers from ""Apocalypse Now"", Michael Herr, handle the adaption fairly well in knowing what to keep from the story in and what to leave out.  For someone who made himself a legend by adapting ""The Godfather"" and ""Heart of Darkness"", Coppola sure knows how to use a novel as the main source for creating a good tale here.Plus, the movie has an excellent supporting cast (Danny DeVito, Jon Voight, Mary Kay Place, Claire Danes, Dean Stockwell, Virginia Madsen, Mickey Rourke, Roy Scheider, and Danny Glover) to be in the movie alongside Damon.  Among the ones that come to mind, DeVito is great Deck, as a crafty (and humorous) para-lawyer who has trouble with the bar exam and helps Rudy in adjusting to the line of work, Voight's fine as the not-so-totally slimey lawyer that Rudy faces in the lawsuit, just looking at the Danes character for a second alone, is a really sad and Rourke is amusing as Brusier, the employer that Deck and Rudy desert when they find out that he's the target of a federal probe.In conclusion, ""The Rainmaker"" may not be as highly memorable as ""The Godfather"" or ""Apocalypse Now"", however; it shows that Coppola still has the skills to be a great film-maker.

Matt Damon's character, a young lawyer fighting his first case, tackles a huge medical insurance company in a landmark civil case. The company refused to honor a claim for bone marrow work for a young man from a (decidedly) working class family in Memphis. Can Matt, and his sidekick, Danny DeVito assemble a winning case when facing a high-powered, ruthless defense team led by Jon Voigt? You might say that 'life imitates art' -- Michael Moore's scathing portrayal of the Insurance industry in 'Sicko' makes the unflattering portrayal of the offending company in this story seem even more fitting. Of course, Grisham was writing primarily about the legal profession, and the slippery slope that entraps its members into trading ethics for cash. Do these arrogant corporate lawyers need to be taken down a peg or two?So, we have a great courtroom drama, fine support from a very young Claire Danes, terrific work by a youthful Damon and a seasoned DeVito - (the success of this script depended largely on good chemistry twixt the two), a couple of genuinely funny bits and some interesting insight into the Ol' South that Grisham seems to have picked up along the way.Btw: I watched two Damon flicks today: Ocean's-Eleven and Rainmaker.

But it should be noted that this is the movie that brought Jon Voigt back into the hollywood limelight after being relegated to obscurity after his huge run of 1970s memorable movies.

Matt Damon was just alright and DeVito and Rourke were both good I would say the best performance was from Claire Danes she was the most memorable thing about the picture because I remember her being very timid and oppressed throughout the show and yet she has the most courage of any of them. She had a good rapport with Damon and made it more believable. Damon is a guy trying to be a lawyer who takes on a big company with a powerhouse legal team who are defending themselves against a lawsuit of some sort I confess I don't remember the whole plot verbatim as I haven't seen it since it was in the theater in 1997 and haven't felt a desire to do so again.

Coppola has directed movies like the epic mob masterpiece The Godfather and plenty of other great movies.This was released a couple of weeks before Matt Damon's huge hit Good Will Hunting, so this is one of his first big roles in a movie. Danny De Vito does a great job in adding plenty of humor to the movie, and Jon Voight adds a lot of dramatic effect to his character.The story follows a young lawyer who is representing the family of a boy with leukemia who could have had proper treatment, but couldn't because of a seedy insurance company. The movie pretty much follows the book, but the problem is that the book had a few great sub plots that seem absent from the movie, and one scene that happens in the middle of the movie happens in the end of the book.

When Kelly gives her sadistic creep of a husband the final 'coup de grace' and several dozen delicious moments with Danny DeVito. Devito joins the list of greatest character actors of all time - the ones who made the classic films so great in the thirties and forties. Mary Kay Place is outstanding but her artistry is so 'invisible' and perfect she becomes Mrs. Black and we forget to even think of her as an actor.This is my favorite Matt Damon movie and it is obvious that Coppola has a firm grip on all his 'mannerisms' and keeps him in the role. Matt has a bad habit of making bedroom eyes at everything in some films. Of course it is a treat to see the great Teresa Wright playing a affectionately written and performed portrait.

Obviously (at least for me) this isn't a great film like some other works by this director (The Godfather...), but it's worth to be seen even twice. I mean you can't think you wasted your time when you leave the theater. Concerning other aspects, I must say that I can't avoid to think of the similarity between the couple Damon-De Vito and the characters Don Quijote and Sancho Panza from the famous novel by Cervantes. As in the novel, Damon is a knight that fights for a lost cause, and De Vito is a practical man who always tries to take benefit from every situation. As the film progresses (and as in the novel) Damon transmits his spirit to De Vito and finally he fights for the cause with even more conviction than Damon (and he is even fat and short like the novel character...!) One negative point: It's comforting to see the truth and justice prevail over everything, but I can't accept Damon as the final hero when he killed another man and nothing happened to him. Nobody has the rights to take away the life of another, no matter who he/she is... My rating is 6-7 out of 10.",The Rainmaker

69,garyvanhorn,Well done legal drama.,7,10 January 2011,"Lawyer movies are only worth watching if they are well done, and The Rainmaker is one of those movies. Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon) is a young lawyer straight out of law school and desperate for work. While learning the legal ropes under a crooked lawyer, Bruiser Stone (Mickey Rourke), Rudy takes on the case of Donny Ray Black (Johnny Whitworth) a young boy stricken with leukemia and his medical claims denied by his insurance company.What follows is a typical case of the little guy vs. big corporate greed, but what makes the story watchable and not cliché is the wonderful cast and acting. The players include John Voight as the sleazy corporate lawyer, Dean Stockwell as the corrupt judge in the pocket of the corporate world, Danny DeVito as Matt Damon's legal assistant/would be lawyer that can't seem to pass the bar exam, and Danny Glover as the anti-corporate judge whose rulings help Matt Damon bring the case to trial.The movie does a good job of presenting the ebb and flow of the case, he audience's opinion of guilt or innocence sways with each new witness and legal maneuver, until the final bombshell is dropped and the case is easily decided. To sum it up, the story is a bit cliché yet well told, the characters are similarly cliché yet well acted, and the ending is typical of Hollywood yet rewarding.

There are tender and poignant performances by supporting players, such as Johnny Whitworth as the leukemia stricken Donny Ray Black. The role of Donny's mother is finely handled by Mary Kay Place, her naturally blithe spirit suppressed in a character of considerable depth and subtle inflection. Claire Danes as Kelly Riker, a stoic victim of domestic abuse, proves herself equal to any other working actress. Rudy's non-relationship with Kelly only magnifies the immensity of the fine young man's complete and total awesomeness. Eventually the increasingly manipulative story wears itself out, the mounting heap of standard courtroom drama clichés just too formidable an obstacle for me to navigate. This film had been drained of all its worth by the 90 minute mark, but there were still another 45 minutes of futile milking, such as the sudden appearance of a key witness whose insider information threatens to incriminate the evil large corporation. Virginia Madsen is convincing in the part, but her fine contribution is undermined by the film's insistently maudlin tactics. No sooner had she delivered her moving testimony - count to four - and the poor girl is exposed as the scornful rejected lover of the nasty company man. Her character is further impugned by her own admission that she traded sex for corporate privilege, but only because it was demanded of her. Even a perfectly green, wet behind the ears newbie lawyer would have sense enough to thoroughly check out a star witness' background, and if not Rudy then certainly the crafty Deck Shifflet. But Rudy's improbable incompetence was already established in his first appearance before a judge where he lacked even the slightest clue of courtroom procedure, despite 3 or 4 years of law school experience. Oh right, it was a modest, second rate, non Ivy League school. Maybe the school advertised on the back of match books?If Danny Glover as the mercifully decent replacement judge can't win me back into the film's corner then maybe a comically sweater-ed Roy Scheider can. He proves to be curiously entertaining, but his minor bit is too little too late to save this con job of a film that doesn't even have the decency to end when it's over. It just keeps plodding on and on, tripping over at least two or three separate endings before it finally trickles out, collapsed under its own ponderous weight.

74,paul-nemecek,Coppola Does Grisham,9,7 July 2018,"The first questions I ask in reviewing a film are ""was it a story worth telling"", and ""was it a story well told."" Given the artists involved in making the Rainmaker, it should come as no surprise that this film gets a solid yes on both counts. John Grisham (author of A Time to Kill, The Firm, the Client, etc.) is one of the hottest novelists writing today, and Francis Ford Coppola (Godfathers I & II, Apocalypse Now, The Outsiders) is one of the great directors of the last twenty years. I knew Grisham had crafted a story worth telling when I read his novel. Fortunately, Coppola handles the material well and turns out one of the best adaptations of a Grisham novel yet.As is the case in many of Grisham's novels, the hero is a young struggling lawyer just out of law school. But in the Rainmaker, young Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon) is stuck with a law firm that specializes in ambulance-chasing and haunting the halls of hospitals in search of potential clients. When the head of the firm runs afoul of the law, Rudy joins forces with self-described ""para-lawyer"" Deck Shifflet (Danny DeVito), and the pair strike out on their own.Their only real client is Dot Black (Mary Kay Place) whose son, Donny Ray, is dying from leukemia. Donny Ray needs a blood transfusion, but the insurance company has refused to cover it. This sets the stage for a real David v. Goliath showdown, with Danny DeVito almost stealing the show as the ""sling-carrier"" for our 20th century David. John Voight plays Leo F. Drummond, the insurance company's attorney, and does an excellent job of making it easy for us to dislike him and the company he represents. Claire Danes plays a battered wife-and eventual love interest for young Rudy-in a subplot that seems a bit hurried and underdeveloped at points.One of the things that makes this movie so enjoyable is its smallness. In an era of star vehicles and special effects thrillers, it's a welcome change to watch a film that is simply a good story well-told. There is no over-the-top super performance, and there are no dazzling special effects, but the film is chock-full of solid performances by excellent actors (including Danny Glover, Teresa Wright, Randy Travis, and Roy Scheider). Coppola is known as the director who turns unknowns into stars. He seems to have continued the trend with rising star Matt Damon in the lead role.

Legal legend Leo (impeccably portrayed by Mr. Angelina Jolie, Sr.) was the star of the Memphis bar, especially after the shocking collapse of competitor Bendini, Lambert & Locke. In the early 80s and beyond Drummond led his partners at the high-powered firm of Tinley Britt to an unprecedented string of victories the likes of which southwest Tennessee had never seen, attracting such top dollar clients as FedEx and Great Benefit Insurance. Director Francis Ford Coppola (best known as executive producer of Jeepers Creepers 2 and, to a lesser extent, for directing a couple well-received films in the 1970s about Sicily) carefully studies the infamous barrister's sudden disintegration in The Rainmaker, leading to a Golden Globe nomination for the actor (strangely in the supporting role category).Leo Drummond's first appearance of the film is, appropriately, in the place where the magic happens, a Tennessee courtroom. Completely at ease with a team of associates behind him and the grumpy old judge in his hip pocket, Drummond has no idea his ego on this fateful day will slowly bring his world to a slumping end - much like Elvis slumped over in death on his toilet just a short distance from this very courthouse.Rudy Baylor-more on him later-and 6 time bar exam failure Deck Shifflet (Danny DeVito) show up to the courtroom alone, with zero law licenses between them. Attorney of record J. Lyman ""Bruiser"" Stone (Mickey Rourke) is nowhere to be found. Legal lion Leo F. Drummond has a choice: A) ask for immediate dismissal of the case by default since no attorney appeared to argue against Drummond's pending motion to dismiss (almost certain to be granted, particularly with a sympathetic judge) or B) toy with the recent law school grad who is not yet licensed. The lion decides to toy with the mouse.After Baylor is sworn in earlier than all of his more accomplished law school classmates (take that top 99.5% of the class), he is ushered into the crusty Judge's chambers for a tag team settlement conference that would only be participated in by the absolute laziest Judge to ever take the bench. Baylor demurs and the case is set over for a future date, but Drummond's fate has already been sealed.By the time of the next court date the trash Judge is dead of a heart attack and a real Judge (Roger Murtaugh) takes over the case. In a still-Marlboro-smelling chambers, but with a new occupant, Drummond is verbally manhandled by the robed jurist and lurches out in a daze with his lackeys in tow, motion to dismiss denied and the case fast-tracked for trial.At a deposition held at the Great Benefit headquarters Drummond reveals the new state of his skills, admitting aloud ""I may not be 100% today, but I'm here in spirit."" Drummond next cheapens himself by bugging Baylor's phone in a bumbling fashion, leading to the most embarrassing moment of a 35 year career. After Baylor and Shifflet stage a fake jury-tampering phone call on the party line solely for the (great) benefit of the snooping listeners, Leo accuses innocent anti-Plaintiff juror Mr. Porter of fraud - which leads to Drummond being tackled by the wrongfully accused juror onto the patterned floor of the courtroom, loafers flying and Brooks Brothers suit soiled on the dirty tile. After Porter is dragged out and excused as a juror Baylor then signals to Drummond that he set the whole thing up, leading to Mr. Jolie's amazing non-verbal facial acting which clearly garnered him the Golden Globes nomination.As the evidentiary part of the trial begins Rudy Baylor demonstrates his utter lack of knowledge of basic courtroom procedure by asking leading question after leading question, apparently failing to grasp what a leading question even is. Bringing shame to the Cecil B. Humphreys School of Law at the University of Memphis with his shoddy in-court performance (the school's ranking plummeted soon after this display before eventually improving somewhat to its current position tied for 138th in U.S. News & World Report, 2020) we are constantly reminded how inexperienced Rudy really is, contrasted with rare flashes of Mr. Drummond displaying the skills that made him Memphis's top lawyer as he objects to Rudy's poorly worded questions appropriately and exposes Baylor's naiveté. In a glimpse of the former greatness Drummond also exposes the Plaintiff's mother (Mary Kay Place) on the witness stand as a money-hungry opportunist.As Baylor calls Great Benefit reps to testify, including Jackie Lemancyzk (Virginia Madsen), Leo tries to block the witness from testifying. However, 6 time bar exam failure Shifflet hands Drummond his loafers a second time, leaping into action (as he argues before the jury illegally without a law license) to school Drummond on a basic Tennessee rule of evidence which leaves Leo looking shellshocked. Next Drummond seems to redeem himself as he temporarily gets a key piece of evidence excluded; however, in the pre-internet world of legal research Drummond and his sloppy team are somehow unaware of the famous DeSoto case decided in 1992 regarding the admissibility of stolen evidence, a case that is so well known that even the missing Bruiser Stone (who himself successfully argued the DeSoto appeal, now lounging during a tropical beachside phone call with Deck) can remember the approximate book and page where the case can be found.Despite his ignorance Drummond still manages to secure the small temporary victory by getting section Q of the Great Benefit senior claims adjusters' manual excluded as evidence, but the glory is short-lived. With the DeSoto precedent belatedly in hand Baylor tries to reintroduce the same evidence the next day, to which Drummond weakly objects on the basis of the it already having been excluded. Rudy beats his elder yet again.Drummond's lack of trial prep is never more evident than when Great Benefit CEO Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) gets on the stand and is taken apart by rookie Baylor and unlicensed ""lawyer"" Deck Shifflet who again commits the crime of unauthorized practice of law, without comment on the crime by anyone in attendance. After inexperienced Baylor slaughters CEO Scheider on the stand, Drummond can only offer the pained look of someone passing a kidney stone.Drummond then snoozes his way through a prejudicial Baylor closing argument that is basically just a portable-screen video of the deceased Plaintiff making inadmissible statements from beyond the grave, a ridiculous idea that would never be allowed if only Leo raised a simple objection. Meanwhile Drummond's own closing summation is a rambling rant about how a ruling in favor of the Plaintiff will raise the premiums through the roof for all insurance customers, in the same breath as he decries government's role in healthcare (oblivious to the irony), which could actually bring down inflation-adjusted premium costs for most customers with an individual mandate and eliminate the kind of claim denial shenanigans that sustain all the Great-Benefit-type hustlers of the insurance world.After the jury foreman announces a verdict finding Great Benefit responsible for $50 million in punitive damages (which could never happen today since a Tennessee republican legislature passed a $750,000 damages cap in 2011 as part of a ""tort reform"" package), Leo can do nothing but sit back in dismay and wonder where it all went wrong. Days later we see Drummond, strangely still wearing his suit jacket in his office sitting behind a cluttered desk, as he makes a half-gloating call to Rudy Baylor informing him that as Great Benefit has filed for bankruptcy (due to the huge verdict) none of them will get paid after all (possibly not entirely understanding the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process). Likely Drummond kills himself at his desk a short time later though this is not confirmed on camera.Rudy Baylor's film-ending narration concludes the picture with a riff on his uncertain future, but Rudy does know one thing-he must not live a life where ""I'd wake up one morning and find that I'd become Leo Drummond.""

82,escoles,Good Clean Storytelling,9,12 March 2000,"I was amazed at how good this flick turned out to be, and I believe that's mostly because it's so understated. This is a great example of what Francis Ford Coppola is capable of when he concentrates on using his craft to tell the story rather than convince the world that he's an artist: He gets really fine, realistic performances out of a collection of skilled journeyman performers.Damon stands out in the lead. His ambivalence with his own skill at the more ethically borderline aspects of the law comes through strongly -- while his character is clearly satisfied that his actions are justified, he's not happy he's had to go as far as he does. Damon communicates this ambivalence with a seemingly effortless skill that lets the character speak instead of the movie star.",The Rainmaker
83,PeterWilliamson,Great Drama,9,5 April 2008,"This movie is a great drama with excellent movie by Elmer Bernstein, if you liked A Few Good Men or A Time To Kill, this movie is for you. It leaves them for dead. This movie showed me that Matt Damon is one of the best 'good guy' actor that I've viewed.Francis Ford Capolla brings this almost perfect film co-staring Danny DeVito, Clairy Danes and Micky Roarke. The story starts when a small, infamous lawyer (Matt Damon) getting a job at a reasonably small law firm business. His boss (Micky Rourke) is a helpful character capable of giving the opportunities to who ever he feels necessary. Danny DeVito plays the co-worker who helps Matt Damon throughout his first case, which happens to be a big one; and finally, Clarie Danes.

84,FatPhil,A break from Coppola's usual dirge - but at a cost.,5,1 February 2003,"Never mind the quality - feel the length!Over 2 hours, but it didn't feel that long, so it can't be all bad. But was it all necessary? I could have sliced 20 minutes of fluff from it, and maybe filled it back out with the same length of Grisham-esque moot. Apart from the unnecessary (romantic) side-plot the whole thing was a straight line. A dotted line at that - it was choppy, so to speak.It's not a bad film. Even if you think I've been negative I'd encourage people to watch it, as there is something in there for even cynics like me. Danny DeVito provided enough comic relief with his almost mole-like down-to-earth character, for example.I'm a very harsh voter, and I gave it a 5 which for me is _right_ down the middle.Phil",The Rainmaker

86,dav7nine,Great film!,7,12 February 2005,I thought this film was really good...... I like courtroom dramas and this is right up there with the best of them. It's basically about a young lawyer starting out who gets embroiled in what turns out to be a major case.Matt Damon is really good in it... I'm starting to really like him as an actor. Danny DeVito supports him brilliantly as his wee helper-guy. John Voight is also very good and Danny Glover makes a surprise appearance as the judge.A good courtroom drama that has you interested all the way to the end.A 7/10 for me...Dave,The Rainmaker
87,www-aktomer,Not just a Davis vs Goliath story!,9,10 June 2019,"As the synopsis of the movie suggests, it shows Matt Damon fighting the insurance claims giants, but the story is much more than that. What I liked the most about the movie is the personal touch it brings. The story builds up slowly but elegantly, and its beautiful to watch Damon perform so naturally.
I think that this movie might have set him up perfectly before another one of his gem, 'Good Will Hunting', which was released within a month after this one.",The Rainmaker
88,danlevans,Read the book,5,13 July 2003,I read the Rainmaker and loved it. Of course I wanted to see the film. What a disappointment. So much was left out. It was so chopped up. Then after it was over I came to the conclusion that the essence of the film was captured. In fact the movie did a better job of showing how Rudy (Matt Damon) was way over his head. You will lose a lot if you watch the movie without reading the book. Do both and you will enjoy both.,The Rainmaker
89,schreiber-stephen,The Rainmaker addresses a hot button issue before it was a hot button issue,7,24 January 2014,"With everyone today using buzz words to talk about health care legislation, this is a novel about a health insurance company scamming policyholders by refusing claims that is adapted to a screenplay for a movie that was written and filmed years before reform was on the horizon. It is extremely forward thinking for its time.The Rainmaker, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, wasn't a beautifully shot movie but it was executed well. This film holds up as it does not feel dated like many movies released around the same time. There are some movies you can tell when they came out and this is one of those films that ages very well as are not many outdated styles shown and the film was shot in a way that doesn't feel dated. By that, I mean that some movies released around that time had the same feel to them and this one felt much more like it was being played through a storyteller's eyes. There wasn't much flair involved in the filming but it didn't need that. Nothing was creative about the way it was shot but it worked.The casting of this film was great as each player delivers a fantastic performance top to bottom. A perfect example of this is that Dean Stockwell is only in this film for a short period of time and he delivers quite a performance given the limited amount of time on screen. Matt Damon works as the do-good attorney in a sea of snakes. Danny DeVito is about as good as he gets in this film. Coppola could have done a bit more with the framing of the film to work with DeVito's size but that is the only problem with the performance.The movie isn't perfect because there are quite a few issues with certain lines and regardless of how good DeVito and Voight are, there are some cheesy and predictable lines that they are forced to deliver that drag the movie down a little. The film could have done more with the given novel it had to work with but there is only so much that can be done to adapt a novel into a film. It will never be a perfect interpretation of the novel unless this film was done in the same way as The Stand or The Hobbit. You cannot please everyone and I think The Rainmaker did a good job with this story.",The Rainmaker

91,TheUniquePerception,Holds your attention and makes you ponder,9,18 June 2015,"This is one of those films that makes a person question what they would do in similar situations. When we encounter injustice do we act or do nothing? It is a great role for Matt Damon as he plays the innocence of a recent graduate well. As his character is faced with older more heartless lawyers, he shows a lot of courage to try to do what is right against all odds. It is a film that may motivate you to make your world a better place. The cameo by Mickey Rourke is a fun experience. Many us can recall meeting our first corrupt boss and this scene with Rourke captures the feeling. Jon Voight plays an outright cold calculating corporate warrior. He pulls it off so well that it really extracts a strong emotional response. There is a lot of solid acting, writing and drama that feels real. It is the sort of experience that can change the way you see the world. And that is good.",The Rainmaker
92,Kraemorr,Coppola brings a new feel to Grisham.,7,1 November 2001,"Coppola brings a new feel to Grisham, the Coppola feel, and I welcomed it with open arms. But strangely Coppola let this story drag, it quite simply lost its great momentum during its last third. It was going for the best Grisham adaption, and who else would be more capable than Coppola, but, even though this was miles better than his previous effort Jack, this was disappointing for Coppola. The end credit music brings the perfect feel to the film and he had that feel for the most part of it, but these things happen. 7.5/10",The Rainmaker
93,stewartmatt99,One of the best movies from a Grisham book,7,29 July 2010,"I have seen many movies that were made from a John Grisham book, it almost seems that every book he writes ends up becoming a movie. But, every one of the movies that come out, in my opinion, fall short of any expectations that I have before I see the movie. They all seem to be the same movie. I am not saying that I hate the movies, because most of them have good casts, and for the most part are good movies. But because they are all so similar, and even located in the same town sometimes, they can become a little boring at times. However, The Rainmaker was in my opinion somewhat different than the others. It is still the same old courtroom drama type deal, but I just thought it was a better movie than most of the others coming from a John Grisham novel. The Rainmaker had a great cast, and great performances, especially coming from Matt Damon as Rudy Baylor, and Jon Voight was very good, as he always is. It also just had a really great story in general. I would say most people will at least enjoy this movie, and if you are a fan of any other movie of a John Grisham book, you will absolutely love this movie. Now do not get me wrong it was a far from perfect film, but still a good one.",The Rainmaker

As he comes to grip with the stark reality of the real world, struggling financially, he turns to the shady and undesirable ""Bruiser"" Stone for work. He further loses his naivety and innocence as he comes in conflict with the jaded, slightly corrupt, ethically ambiguous, big time corporate lawyers.Rudy with the help of his partner, Deck (Danny DeVito), rediscover a sense of justice and purpose seemingly lost in their profession. Along the way, Rudy slowly kindles a relationship with Kelly, a client of his, as he struggles to determine whether the law alone is strong enough to serve justice to the worst of society.It's a wholesome piece, about a man fighting for what is right, with the law (and occasionally with his fists), come what may. While Rudy does not regain his innocence throughout the film, he regains what is infinitely more important - his sense of justice.",The Rainmaker
95,chasman99,A sad interpretation of the book,5,4 March 2005,"I am so tired of the movies made from books that eliminate important facts and change items to appease the viewer. First things first, the monologue begins the movie detailing some of what they found unworthy to shoot on film. Missing in this is how Rudy lost his job to the boys at Tinley Britt, but I guess that little bit of conflict was unnecessary huh? We start the movie when Rudy gets his job with Bruiser and that is about half way through the book. Left out again is Rudy's best friend, Booker, and the stress he is feeling over his lost love and his eviction and bankruptcy. The bankruptcy is mentioned in passing but that is it.This is forgivable until we get to the trial. What is left out: Involvement from his professors, the section U discovery with his new found lawyer friends, and a large part of conflict between Kipler and Drummond. Danny Glover is OK, but a more energetic and younger actor would have fared better I think. If you read the book, nothing goes wrong for young Rudy and the judge is so partial it is scary, but we missed major points of the movie without that conflict building and the total embarrassment of the big shot lawyer by the judge and new attorney.Danny Devito was AWESOME as Deck, and he had the ticks and mannerisms down pat. Damon was decent but not real dynamic.If you have not read the book, this is not a bad movie I suppose, but I can divorce myself from the inconsistencies enough to realize that the courtroom drama was not all that compelling either. Considering how good the first three book to movie conversions went, this was a chance at redemption after the Chamber. Not a very good movie, and more support for reading a novel over seeing things interpreted on film.",The Rainmaker
96,acorral-1,Coppola is still a good director.,8,26 January 2006,"After making his master pieces (""The godfather I and II"" and ""Apocalypse now"") between 1972 and 1979, Francis Ford Coppola never had the same success with other movie. He directed near a dozen of films in the 80's and 90's, and probably the most acclaimed were ""The cotton club"" (1984), 'The godfather III"" (1990) and his adaptation of Bram Stroker's novel ""Dracula"" (1992). In 1997 he repeated a formula well known by him: adapt a novel to the big screen. He chose a story about a young lawyer, Rudy Baylor (fairly interpreted by Matt Damon) and his first experiences in the law world. There are four topics I would like to talk about this film, ""The rainmaker"" (1997). (1) Direction by Coppola. As a filmmaker, he proved that he is still capable of telling stories combining humor, drama and deep emotions. Coppola is very skillful developing his characters and has the ability to select a good cast to work with. Besides Damon (who is OK in his role), the director selected professional and experienced actors to support secondary roles. Mickey Rourke (as the folkloric Bruiser Stone), John Voight (as the big firm partner, Leo Drummond), Dany Glover (as the sympathetic judge), Danny Devito (excellent performance as the almost-lawyer Deck Shifflett) and even in minor roles was supported by good actors like Roy Scheider (Great Benefit CEO), Dean Stockwell (as the corrupt and hard smoker judge Hale) and Virginia Madsen (Jackie Lemanczyk). Other good thing about the director is his ability to move the characters to the exact point where they deliver a solid and convincing acting performance, including young actors in main roles, like Damon, Clare Danes (as the beaten wife) and Johny Withworth (as the young character dying of leukemia). As I mentioned in the title, Coppola is still a good director. (2) The criticism against two major American institutions: lawyers and insurance companies. As always, the poor and low income population is the affected. During the movie we can see what reality is along the ""land of opportunities"": big institutions and firms don't care about the individuals but for money. Individuals are only the means to get income, nothing more. There are interesting procedures used by the insurance institutions to get the majority of the income with the minimal expense (related with claims and reimbursements). In the other hand, lawyers are radicalized: since the young and idealistic attorney through the experienced and money oriented firm partner. Every lawyer in the movie represents a kind of attorney and the different believes. (3) Stories developed. During the film we follow at least four different sub-plots: the young wife beaten by her husband, the great trial against the insurance company, the tragic tale about a young man dying of leukemia and the old lady and her will. Rudy Baylor is personally involved in the different stories and we are moving from drama to romance, from tragedy to humor. Good combination and balance. (4) Finally, I would like to comment about Danny De Vito's role. With no doubt, is the best developed character of all. He is the responsible of most of the humoristic scenes but at the same time is the key element. He has a lot of connections, experience and non-sensibility manners to get what he wanted. De Vito developed his role with energy and comedy. He is the one that stole the movie for him self. Hope that Coppola has the opportunity to direct a few more movies like this. If well, ""The Rainmaker"" is not his best film by far, the picture is a good example of what he is still capable to do. I recommend this picture to see it, discuss it and have a good time.",The Rainmaker
97,dabrygo,"""Just Another Shark in the Dirty Water""",7,3 March 2021,"Fresh out of law school, Rudy juggles several cases when he starts out at Bruiser's firm: One about changing the will of an elderly lady, who rents a guest room to Rudy in exchange for help with yard work, and another about a leukemia patient whose health insurance company denied his claim under mysterious circumstances. On a lead for another case from Bruiser, Rudy meets Kelly, who is caught up in an abusive relationship. With the help of his partner Deck, Rudy takes on the insurance company and its seasoned law team.I used to read a lot of John Grisham's books back in the day, during high school especially, and I still pick them up when I can. It's been a while since I'd read this one, but parts I think I remember: Rudy's wry and dry lawyer jokes, ambulance chasing with Deck, and I think I learned the word ""deposition"" from this one.So I also don't remember how similar the book and the movie are, but I suspect the movie's gripping courtroom scenes for the insurance case must be close. The jury selection scene was especially great to watch! The dynamic between inexperienced Rudy and street-smart Deck against the insurance firm's presitigious lawyers makes for a good underdog story.One book I had read closer to watching the movie (and more recently) was Grisham's The Firm. The movie changed some minor events slightly, and it had a profound effect on how I perceived the characters. I feel something similar might have happened here, because Rudy's and Kelly's relationship didn't feel right to me.I had forgotten that Danny Glover and Roy Scheider were in this movie and enjoyed them immensely. All the actors fit into their roles very naturally! Damon's Rudy; DeVito's Deck; Glover's Judge Tyrone Kipler; Jon Voigt as Leo Drummond, the insurance company's main lawyer; and Mickey Rourke as Bruiser, Rudy's boss with questionable ethics.But it's the closing thought I remember most from this film, inspiration for the title of this review:""Every lawyer, at least once in every case, feels himself crossing a line that he doesn't really mean to cross... it just happens... And if you cross it enough times it disappears forever. And then you're nothin but another lawyer joke. Just another shark in the dirty water.""Despite how everyone else around him in the story behaves, Rudy has authentic, honest, and trusting relationships with his clients. One gets the sense that Rudy became a lawyer because he genuinely wanted to help people, that he gradually became disillusioned because of what he saw in some other lawyers, and that he decided to leave because he felt that their weaknesses were his weaknesses were all our weaknesses as humans. Much later, I would learn the story of Cincinnatus, who left his farm because his country needed him, and then returned to his farm when he felt his work was done. And because that story resonates with me in the same way I wonder if Cincinnatus felt something similar. The story of The Rainmaker, especially the courtroom scenes, are very good, but for me it's the ending that I watch this movie for.",The Rainmaker
98,Spanner-9,Top-notch legal drama,9,1 May 2000,"""The Rainmaker"" is by a long way the best Grisham adaptation yet. The characters are well written and believable. There is some wit in the film (mostly from Danny De Vito's character), the plot is something we can understand so that we can sympathise with the characters and it contains a very powerful subplot about domestic abuse. Francis Ford Coppola is to be commended for a splendid piece of cinema that lives up to all expectations. Matt Damon, Danny De Vito, Claire Danes and Jon Voight portray their characters in the style that Grisham wrote them in, and that is good to see.",The Rainmaker
99,cuz,A Grisham movie that won't put you to sleep,7,28 November 1998,"I'm not a John Grisham fan. I did sneak a peek at a friend's copy of ""The Rainmaker"", read about twenty pages filled with cliched characters, and I still can't figure out why his books sell millions. The movie version of ""The Firm"" was lacklustre, and I nearly nodded off during ""The Pelican Brief"". On the flipside, I enjoyed ""A Time to Kill"". So, it was with some apprehension that I tuned into ""The Rainmaker"" on cable. The fact that Francis Coppola directed it eased my worries a bit. ""Apocalypse Now"" was amazing, and the Godfather movies are classics. Coppola has a way of bringing out the best in even the most simplistic material. Matt Damon was the ideal choice to play the young, this-is-my-first-case-and-boy-am-I-scared lawyer who takes on a big insurance company. Mickey Rourke disappears too quickly as Damon's would-be mentor, but thankfully we have Danny DeVito around as a resourceful paralegal who shows Damon the ropes. There's an awkward subplot involving a battered wife (Claire Danes, unfortunately always sporting a fat lip or a black eye). Naturally, Damon feels sorry for her, and falls in love. Perhaps Grisham should have written a second book! No, let's not give him any ideas. The investigations leading to the big trial are well done, and Coppola does a great job setting up the courtroom battle. We can't help rooting for Damon as he fights to prove the insurance company's failure to pay a claim  resulted in the death of a young man. It's not exactly ""The Verdict"". That movie was far more complex (and featured a superb performance from Paul Newman). Still, ""The Rainmaker"" delivers. And, I'm actually looking forward to seeing ""The Chamber."" Note to Hollywood: Why not give Grisham a rest, and make more movies from Scott Turow's novels? Just a thought.",The Rainmaker

He is now known as a well established and skilled leading actor. But when this movie came out he was only just starting out in the industry. He is such a skilled actor and it amazes me the methods he uses to do so.I read he put cold rocks in his clothing to look uncomfortable in one of the scenes. Wow.Francis Ford Coppola, once again, an amazing job at adapting the book. The moodiness and tone of the film was spot on, and matched the story perfectly.My favourite thing to do right now is watch a movie with no context of who made it, or the story behind it and then going back and researching it and finding out all the cool facts about it.

I must say however, that one of the reasons I like it so much is that it is so similar to the Verdict starring Paul Newman from 1982, which I loved. I am honestly surprised that there were no lawsuits regarding the two films, as I see simply names changed, characters made older or younger, etc. Matt Damon plays young, naive Rudy Baylor, a lawyer with no experience. Newman plays Frank Galvin, burnt-out alcoholic lawyer. Danny Devito plays the Jack Warden role. One case focuses upon a boy stricken with leukemia in which the insurance company will not cover a bone marrow transplant. The other film's focus is upon a woman who enters a hospital to give birth and is given the wrong anesthetic. The surprise witnesses are similar too. And the verdict in both films is extremely similar with both juries asking to be allowed to increase the monies awarded. Mr. Grisham probably thought that no one would notice 15 years later. Most didn't notice. I did.",The Rainmaker

The movie focus's more on the trial, and as a ""lawyer"" movie it's one of the better ones. It's the casting that carries the film. The leads usually get most of the (deserved) credit, but the supporting characters are often overlooked. Oscar winner Teresa Wright is a perfect Birdie, and Mickey Rourke as bruiser?! Come on, even people who hate this adaptation gotta admit that's a pretty great fit.Yes. The books better, just let it go and enjoy the movie.",The Rainmaker
107,Mannequin,I Liked It! But I Haven't Read the Book...,7,15 August 2004,"It was 10 minutes to 8:00 o'clock and ""The Rainmaker"" was about to play on HBO. I had never seen it, so I dashed over to IMDB to check the rating. I was disappointed to see that it only had a 6.8. But the channel guide gave it 3 out of 4 stars. I decided to go for it.It turns out that I wouldn't be disappointed again. ""The Rainmaker"" was engaging and interesting, well-acted and well-made. It's a great movie to see if you want to kill two hours when you don't have anything better to do. There are movies far better than ""The Rainmaker,"" but most movies are far worse. I gave this a 7/10 - just what it deserves.I'm a little upset to see the low rating here on IMDB, but I suspect it's because many readers of the book were disappointed in the film. That would be ashame if that were the case. As a movie, and as I've pointed out, it's very good - worthy of a 7 (which is notable).I hope you enjoy the film as have I; but if you've read the book you might be disappointed.",The Rainmaker

109,Well18,Bleeding Heart on a Bleeding Sleeve (manipulation to the extreme),4,19 March 2005,"Okay kiddies, it's time to watch 'The Good Guys and the Bad Guys'. If you can't tell which is which, through having-a-heart-in-the-right-place-on-your-sleeve film-making we will discern between the two and it will be easy going since this film is so blatantly manipulative you'd almost expect an alter call during the credits. The bad guys are the tall mean lawyers who have selfish irritating scowls and the camera will usually film them from below to make them look (and seem) more imposing. The will never smile unless it's a wicked smile; they are comfortable and rich and have nothing good about them at all; and their suits cost tons of money. The good guys are the poor people who make no mistakes except for falling into the bad guy's schemes, and who were born to be good and who are filmed from an equal level to make them look normal so to be on our, the viewer's, level. They will have tears in their eyes and will be a cross between a puppy dog and a deer caught in headlights: IE, a puppy dog caught in headlights. Now in this film we have several good guys but the main good guy is Matt Damon, of course (who has the Tom Cruise curse of always having to be the good guy), who is liken to the civil rights lawyers that have never cheated on anything or anyone and who hate money and who take their 1/3 with a chagrin and are like John Edwards, rich and self-loathing that they just had to be rich like all the villains of society. But in this Damon is poor, and never had anyone to help him through life (unlike Sofia Coppola) and we even see him struggling to wait tables while an obviously snooty rich kid wants beer and is being overly rude. And he, Damon, even helps a fancy-fun old lady who is a religious dummy, although we can forgive her because her kid's want her money and she is a victim of the system, and Damon will show her the way eventually by being a good nice guy the way God would be if he were only a registered democrat and not so ""high and mighty"". Then there's a poor girl who is beaten by a rich guy and the rich guy even beats her in the middle of a hospital, so that everyone can know that he's the bad guy and no one has to wonder about him like in most real life cases where a beaten girl has to seem like she's married to a great guy in public which would make her plight seem more of a plight to begin with. And of course this poor beaten girl is also very beautiful but you need to first remove the bandages and then when the beauty shines though she will of course have no love for her very mean hubby and Matt Damon's niceness will win her over in two-point two-seconds after they meet. And then there's Danny Devito's character who is liken to, say, Dick Morris when he was still a ""good"" guy and worked for Bill Clinton, Clinton who, it seems, this movie is subconsciously based because it's about a blonde nice lawyer ""kid"" trying to ""make good"" in a corrupted country. Back to Devito  he is a ""bad"" lawyer but he has ""good"" intentions, that is, he is an underdog shark and eventually sees that the true sharks, Jon Voigt and company, are the really bad villains and that he is just a Mora-fish after all (I thought of him as 'the Prodigal lawyer'). And there's a kid dying of a terminal illness and we will get many shots of him bleeding and suffering to make us all hate the bad guys even more. And there's Mary Kay Place as the dying kid's mother who is the tried-and-true democrat type who probably loved Kennedy but in secret. And there's Mickey Rourke as the master ""corrupt"" lawyer but who isn't bad but seedy, and therefore we kind of like him because, after all, we are of the ""funny villains are really good guys"" mentality. But there's enough of Jon Voigt's one-sided evil character to hate and we can even hate Dean Stockwell as a sold-out judge, but then (another hero emerges) as Danny Glover replaces him as the good judge, and all the while he is rooting for Matt Damon over the villainous greedy insurance lawyers I mean after all, aren't all judges supposed to favor one side over the other and blatantly so? Well what can I say, this movie flows well and has some terrific shots and is definitely entertaining and has good acting, but it's so black and white you'll wonder if it's really in color at all. It's the kind of film made for a 5th grader who has to be shown over and over, again and again who the bad guys are just so the good guys can look even better than they do already, and for that this movie is a true marvel of film-making.Oh and there's Roy Schieder who plays the even badder bad guy (the Emperor to Voigt's Darth Vader), the owner of the insurance company that is out to rip off any and every poor person on the planet just to give the poor people's money to the rich (lawyers), sort of Robin Hood in reverse I guess; there are times when Roy's on the stand and his situation is so dire I keep hearing the 'Jaws' theme and I expect him to say: ""We're gonna need a bigger courtroom"". This movie will entertain you but if you have your eyes open it will also amaze you, the way it did me a person who doesn't need to be forced into discerning who is good and who is bad, as if there is really, in real life, any difference between the two other than your own particular point of view.",The Rainmaker
110,cdtidy,"Almost a good thriller, but a miss is as good as a mile",5,28 January 2007,"In ""The Rainmaker"" Matt Damon plays Rudy Bailor, a fresh law graduate who gets involved in a major lawsuit against a health insurance company which denies a claim brought by the family of a leukaemia patient.All the performances are very strong; it's difficult to fault any of them. Where the film goes wrong is that it concentrates solely on Rudy Bailor's story. I can't think of a single scene in which he doesn't feature. His opponents are only ever seen in the courtroom. To me, this single thread wears a bit thin when expanded to fill a two-hour film. Several concurrent threads would have helped to maintain the pace. Mickey Rourke, as Rudy Bailor's mafia lawyer boss Bruiser Stone is sadly under-used. The same goes for Jon Voight as Rudy's legal opponent Leo F. Drummond.Ultimately this film is an endearing but slightly depressing story about a young lawyer getting ""in over his head"" in a landmark case. It's almost a good thriller, but it lacks the action and variety which make a fascinating and gripping film. It's worth watching to pass the time, but it isn't a match for other John Grisham adaptations like ""The Client"" and ""The Pelican Brief"".",The Rainmaker
111,AnthmWright,Good legal drama for new young lawyers out on their own.,10,25 December 2007,"This movie depicts the struggle and hard work of a young lawyer who is pretty much on his own. While the main plot concerns a civil case against an insurance company defendant, the protagonist, Rudy, must delve into many other areas of life and law, just as most young attorneys must.Rudy starts as a law clerk in the only firm that will take him in. While studying for the bar exam, his bosses make him breach legal ethics by ""ambulance chasing"" and committing various other marketing offenses. Rudy's bosses then disappear as the IRS comes hunting them, causing Rudy to have to handle his cases alone with a somewhat inept legal sidekick.Young lawyers on their own can relate to taking on pretty much every case that comes through the door. While fighting a monumental battle against an insurance company, Rudy delves into Estate Planning, Criminal Law, and working on the side just to pay his rent.In the end, Rudy has fought hard and helped people, but comes away with no money.

But what make this movie interesting is it's unique analysis of the lawyers and what they are. Furthermore, this as been done with a very good and subtile sens of humour.

114,stevedep,"well chosen actors, very nicely written moral story",8,20 October 2002,"Where other movies tend to get very dramatic when it comes to ethics this movie is a bit different because Danny Devito gives it a humoristic twist.This movie tells a story about lawyers who have to deal with moral dillemas, most of them don't give it much attention. In contrary to the recently graduated lawyer, who stands out because of his moral responsibility. He does not only show this when he is working but also when he goes after a pretty chick. The role of the new lawyer is nicely acted by Matt Damen, who succeeds in acting the perfect son in law. I was very touched by the pretty chick, ......, who regularly gets beat by her husband and is finally saved by Matt Damen. The point when she decides to end the beatings, the point when she bashes his head, comes unexpectedly.The main story line is about a young man who gets ill and needs an operation but the insurance company won't pay for it. Matt damon fights the insurance company by sewing them. In the beginning this looks like a very hard thing to do but as the movie progresses he gets more and more succesful.All in all the movie is entertaining but it also makes one think about all the injustice in life. The actors tend to be very funny because they are perfect for their parts. In comparison to movies like Philadelphia (1993) this movie doesn't contain an overload of drama and therefore it's nice to view with friends.Steve.",The Rainmaker
115,The-Revenant-of-IMDb,Tame and sappy for a Grisham story,7,13 June 2013,"My problems with it include the overall sappy tone, which marred Matt Damon's otherwise good performance as a rookie lawyer with a Southern twang. It was amusing to see him struggle, and Danny DeVito's character seemed to drive the picture. The plot was on the weak side of things, and it was tame for a John Grisham story. I was also expecting more out of Coppola post-Godfather.I'm glad that the good guys win and everybody feels better once the evil insurance company goes bankrupt. It was heartwarming, but I was expecting more intrigue and suspense. When it didn't come, it made Rudy's narration unnecessary and irritating. Danny Glover felt miscast as the judge, and Jon Voight wasn't allowed much time to shine. I was expecting an intense scene between him and Damon once the lawsuit intensified. The romance felt superfluous because the scenes with the Black family and the old lady show that Rudy cares about people. It was time better suited for conspiracy and chaos, especially since it all seems pointless as the wife gets spared by the DA.Rudy's buddies kept telling him to be careful, but I was left asking why because the bad guys only seemed to care about winning the case as opposed to escalating things with violence like any other Grisham story I've seen. I initially thought Bruiser (Mickey Rourke) would be the antagonist with something to hide, and frankly he was more intimidating and interesting than Great Benefit Insurance.However, it was still enjoyable. I would give it a 7 out of 10.",The Rainmaker

117,Pam-21,"Don't judge a movie based on a book, by the book's cover",8,4 September 2000,"John Grisham is an acquired taste. Many in the film industry do not like his books and especially don't like the clichéd way the stories develop. Fans of his books, however, want the exact same excellence, in the film.So it goes with The Rainmaker. If you didn't like the book, odds are you enjoyed the movie, if you never read the book, odds are you found it a refreshing underrated film, if you were a huge fan of the book, seeing a condensed version of it, put you off severely.As a rule, I avoid reading a book before seeing a movie based on it. They are two separate things. If one can separate the book from a movie that went over the usual 120 minute formula as it was, you can see this film for what it is, refreshing, unique, and hardly as clichéd as any other lawyer story or movie.What makes this one tick so well? Fleshed out characters other than the lead, different levels of supporting characters, some that help hold up the story, some that help hold up the main character, and some that could be considered incidental. Then there is the lack of court clichés. There is no rambling speech, not by the main character, the ""evil"" opponent, or the judge. No speech. Perhaps because the seamless narration of the story provides a nice subtle speech throughout the film. Everytime the story seems on the edge of the predictable court drama twist, it surprises.
Our hero, Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon), has absolutely no idea what he is doing. He chose the law because he idolized the civil rights lawyers who stood up for what was right. A shame that isn't the law he is pursuing. Instead, he is the part of the law lampooned the most, ambulance chasers, suing someone for a bloody nose, a broken arm, hot coffee spilled on one's legs ... you get the drift. Rudy loves the law. It is apparent from the beginning of the film, the law does not love Rudy. His main case, a leukemia patient who did not get a bone marrow transplant because his insurance company, Great Benefits, had the gall to deny his claim eight times, call the patient's mother ""stupid, stupid, stupid"", and call the treatment, ""an experimental procedure"" in open court. As a result, the patient eventually dies and Rudy, the lone lawyer in his firm, takes on Leo F. Drummond (Jon Voight) and his band of merry stuffed shirts for the insurance company. Rudy is outgunned and he knows it. His partner in his firm, Deck Schifflet (Danny DeVito), knowledgeable about the law, but has failed the bar five times and has just as much court experience as Rudy ... zero. Rudy also gets distracted with an abused young wife named Kelly Riker (Claire Danes). His attraction to the girl and how her abused past mirrors that of his mother and himself, reveals little insights into Rudy that we will not see in the courtroom.It is the realness of Rudy and Deck, their imperfections, the fact that they are obviously fallible, that makes the movie so refreshing. Drummond too is an enigma; He is merely the lawyer, not a member of the company. There is no specific reason to hate him, he is good at what he does, he overpowers Rudy mainly based on the law and experience, not on money and power. It is never even clear where Drummond's false sincerity begins and ends in his dealing with Rudy. By making Drummond the opponent, it gives the viewers a rare treat. Drummond is doing his job, he is doing it well, and is a rarity in court films, a worthy opponent, who could realistically, crush our hero like a bug. Kelly also has more than one dimension. Being abused does not make her whiny, co-dependant, and unable to think on her own two feet, and make crucial decisions. She is a rarity as the damsel in distress, when it really counts, she is as strong as her hero.Then it goes without saying the acting is also done in a subtle and successful manner. DeVito especially is superb with his delicate balance of humor as the ambulance chasing Deck. In the middle of an important deposition, Coppola's script relieves the tension by showing us Deck preying on a boy with a broken arm for his business. DeVito may be best known for his over the top character in Taxi, an obvious little troll with few redeeming qualities. Contrast Deck, also a troll with few redeeming qualities, but with great subtleness, it is those qualities that shine through and Deck is anything but over the top. It shows DeVito's amazing skill and control and should have earned him an Oscar nomination. Voight, plays once again, the villain, but unlike his pandering and embarrassing role in Anaconda, with a hear through accent, and little effort, as Drummond, he becomes the role. You forget the actor is not really a southern little worm. Danes, also does a strong job. But it is the actors in the smaller, more thankless roles, like Mary Kay Place, as the victim's mother, Mickey Rourke, as Deck and Rudy's former sleazy employer, and especially an uncredited Danny Glover, as the judge, who bring color and extra depth to characters that could have easily been cookie cutter clichés when Coppola found the need to par down the book's plot.Coppola took a rare, unique, and stylish gem by Grisham, one so different from his other books it was either deemed an overwhelming success or failure, in comparison to his other work, and did a good job trimming the fat, without trimming the dimensions of the book's most crucial characters. He takes out what won't work with his vision, without taking out who the characters are.Something about this movie just works in all the necessary places. While it is not a movie of the year, it is a solid film. All films have perceived imperfections by the viewers and critics, and this one is no exception. It, however, does not have major missteps in any important part of the film. The acting is practically flawless, the direction is practically flawless, and the writing, is amazingly, for a court film, incredibly absent of major flaws.It is certainly worth the less than four dollars it would take to judge for yourself.",The Rainmaker

121,sixdayssouth,Big-time Flop,3,1 May 2006,"If there has ever been a worse novel-to-film adaptation, I haven't seen it. This film, at best, is loosely based on John Grisham's novel and does the book no justice. While Matt Damon (Rudy Baylor), Danny DeVito (Deck Shifflet) and Jon Voight (Leo Drummond) are outstanding in their respective roles, it is more the substance of the film that is lacking. If you've read the book, you'll know what I mean. The film starts halfway through the book with Rudy already working for Bruiser Stone (who is played quite effectively by Mickey Rourke, I might add), and gives no background as to why he's there or the circumstances that led up to his employment with Bruiser. The viewer is then led through the trial process quickly and with virtually no tie-ins to the deep emotional impact of the case on Dot Black and Donny Ray. The viewer is given no insight into the relationships between Rudy and Kelly Riker, Rudy and Dot Black, or even Rudy and Donny Ray. There are several events in the film that are completely contradictory to the events and even the sequence of the book. I could go on for an hour, but you get the picture. In short, if you've read the book and loved it as I did, you'll probably hate the film. If you haven't read the book or read it and hated it, it's possible you may enjoy the film. I myself found it deeply dissatisfying.",The Rainmaker
122,davidhopkinssecond,Pulls at the heartstrings,8,28 August 2021,"Despite some of the mixed reviews out there, this is a really nice, dramatic movie about the difficulty of taking on big business in the pursuit of justice. Very well written and directed, with superb acting all around. My main criticism is that Claire Danes' plot line ends abruptly and ends up being pretty incongruent to the story, but I still like the inclusion of it as a whole. I just wish we could see a bit more of her. I also like how this is maybe one of Coppola's ways of describing his struggles getting American Zoetrope off the ground against major producers. It's a really nice movie, nothing amazing but very enjoyable if you're looking for a good tense courtroom drama, with the superb comedic relief of Devito.",The Rainmaker
123,tragic_slider,Vastly under-appreciated film,9,12 March 2006,"This movie is not a movie that makes you think. It's not arty, there are no Corleones, there's really no issues to ponder long after the credits have stopped rolling. Instead it's a human drama that uses a courtroom battle as its backbone, but the entire body is the honestly-told if ultimately remarkable of a greenhorn lawyer trying to make a life for himself after law school. Like the more recent ""Garden State"" the movie is far more interesting than one would initially expect.I recently read the Grisham novel that the screenplay was adapted from and was impressed by the memorable cast of the characters. The corrupt-and-loving-it Prince and Bruiser, Deck Shiflett as the skeezy ""paralawyer"" who scrapes out a living with an amusing lack of self-consciousness, the bitter-tempered first judge and his pioneering, biased black successor, the politely patronizing and puffed-up Legal Titan Leo Drummond, Cliff and his straight-from-Deliverance hillbilly family, lonely and slightly bossy Miss Birdie, chain-smoking Dot and her addled husband, all of them set a standard for memorable but believable characters.Yet the movie is itself a cut or two above the original material. The extended cast does a hands-down fantastic job of bringing each character to life. First billing has to go to Danny Devito for transforming Deck from Rudy's unscrupulous and ugly sidekick in the novel, into a more take-charge and casually hilarious partner. Just take a look at the scene where he leads Rudy into the hospital or when he's giving out his card to the kids in Dot's neighborhood. But that's just one of about twenty stellar acting jobs. The extended cast includes Danny Glover, Jon Voight, Claire Danes, Mickey Rourke (yes!), Virginia Madsen, and a handful of other talented but lesser-known actors who show their absolute best through the skillful lens of Coppola.Besides the stellar job by the cast, the story is tweaked to absolute perfection. Whether it's the Coppola magic or an excellent adaptation and editing job, I see a transformation similar to his triumph with ""The Godfather"": an absorbing but complex and sometimes rambling story is condensed into its absolute essence. Not a single shot is out of place.Something else struck me about this adaptation -- it reminds me of Peter Jackson's LOTR in the way comic moments are used to balance out the weightiness of the main plot. For example: in LOTR Merry and Pippin set off Gandalf's dragon fireworks, or in the second movie Gimli can't see over the parapet towards the advancing Uruk-hai, or in the third movie Sam and Gollum have their argument over the proper preparation of rabbits and 'taters and Gandalf instructs Pippin to keep his big mouth shut before they enter the hall of Minas Tirith. Likewise ""The Rainmaker"" has its little touches of humor as well, from the sardonic lawyer jokes in Rudy's voice-over, to the scene where Deck fake-helpfully hands over Drummond's lost shoe after he's been assaulted by an angry juror, to Rudy's red-faced apology to the car accident victim in traction whom he has accidentally jostled, to Madsen's laconic yet particularly devoted husband Bert. (""Guess who DIED last night?"" ""...Do you ever sleep?"") There is anxiety during Kelly's return to her house, the suspense of the bug showdown, the pathos of Rudy's final speech: all these combine with the lighter moments to balance each other like a film version of Pickapeppa sauce.Who could have ever guessed that a Grisham novel could be so perfectly adapted to the screen?! Just try watching the ""Pelican Brief"" afterward for comparison. My hat is off to Coppola, his cast, and everyone else who contributed to this understated masterwork.",The Rainmaker

The movie is equally good, which is a very rare thing for me to say since I think that movies practically never do their books justice. Rudy Baylor is a lawyer who has just passed the bar exam and he's broke. He has a case to represent a family who has a son that has leukemia. He is about to die because an insurance company refuses to pay for it. What really drew me to this movie was it that it had everything, the humor, the sadness and the suspense. There are some really cool shots in there that I enjoyed. Matt Damon is pretty good as Rudy baylor and Job Voigt is excellent as the defendant, Leo Drummond. Claire Danes does a nice job as a battered woman and at the end, I realized that her character still had some spunk and wasn't that whinny -delicate-as-china-brat that I thought she was. The best, I tought was Danny Devito, he was very endearing as a street-smart lawyer who hasn't passed the bar exam in 5 years. He's sly, sneaky and perfect.

We've all had people doubting our capabilities, just as the other team of lawyers discount Damon's competence. This film is about personal redemption. Further, I admire Damon's strength.Overall, a film every law student and lawyer should see for its humanity; its brilliance; and its judgment on the American legal system.",The Rainmaker
131,schmidt-timothy,Half-hearted,3,20 April 2013,"This one gets three stars because the formula works to some extent every time. But clearly there is a story to tell behind this movie. FFC took this one on as a hired gun. His script is limp - one of the worst closing arguments in the history of courtroom drama. The script is credited to FFC with ""narration"" by a third party. The over-dubbing of dialog and the addition of a pointless narration, the half-told subplots and the rearrangement of events in the book all point to a desperate resuscitation attempt in post. I am amazed they kept Elmer Bernstein's music, which makes you feel like you are watching an episode of Mannix. And why is Danny Glover uncredited, when he has a major role? I love Coppola's movies, but his heart clearly was not in this one.",The Rainmaker
132,thehighercourt,Great book Great Movie,10,9 January 2008,"I teach a Legal Film class at college and introduced this film for discussion in one of my classes. The students enjoyed the film very much and it did have a favorable discussion session associated with the film reviews of the students. I would recommend this movie to other scholars teaching such Legal Film Studies such as this. As for a review of the film I found it upbeat for the most part and Damon and DeVito were quite a team and I found their work to add comedy to the film. I didn't quite see Daines as the battered wife, but I was surprised that she carried it off rather well. I did not like the whole Damon and Daines part, but I guess we must have romance in every movie these days.",The Rainmaker

And man was i disappointed,Francis Ford Coppola is a great director but this isn't one of his greatest works... What i didn't like about the movie is how the case is presented and the things revolving around it... In the book there are more facts about the research about the case how hard it was to get all the facts, evidence and so on, in the movie they just appear seemingly out of nowhere... They leave out too much that is relevant to the story.Anyway i say read the book first and then see the film or don't see it at all... 5/10",The Rainmaker
134,tmercury,A Morality Play,8,21 January 2009,"Good vs Evil, the small against insurmountable odds. A troubled law ""firm"" with street smarts beats the ever hated Corporate lawyers at their own game. The mostly low key performances by all the actors give this film a watchable and believable factor that I haven't seen before. Matt Damon plays the new and uncertain lawyer so well that we are rooting for him from the beginning. DeVito is a favorite and doesn't disappoint, Jon Voight,powerful. Mickey Rourke? Thanks Coppola. And I love Virginia Madsen. This film has so much more to offer than ""The Firm"", another story of corruption, because we are drawn to the people who are hurt, not just a lawyer who may lose his ability to practice law.",The Rainmaker
135,dianeevans-69590,Rookie lawyer fights against evil insurance company,8,30 July 2017,"This gentle David and Goliath style story is a delight to watch and an inspiration to viewers to work hard, be determined and maintain self belief against the odds. Matt Damon underplays his role very well. Clare Danes is less believable as a battered wife - I'd be terrified in her shoes, but she maintains a fixed slight irritation when the baseball bat starts swinging. Virginia Madsen steals the movie, making her character shine with integrity and empathy. She appears for about ten minutes, so make the most of her. Micky Rourke? Was he bored, too much trouble or couldn't learn his lines? Seems to be under-used for some reason. I could actually smell Jon Voight's cologne, so well did he play the rich top lawyer in the expensive suit.",The Rainmaker
136,CMWinn,Read the book instead,4,28 November 1998,"I'm glad I read the book first.  Otherwise, I never would've been able to comprehend what was happening in this movie.  What went wrong?!  Characters and sub-plots are introduced then discarded repeatedly throughout the entire movie. For example, it is never fully revealed why Bruiser left his practice or what happened to Birdy's will.  Why introduce them if we aren't given all the information about them?  The entire film had a rushed pace to it. In short, I think this movie fell very short of its potential.  I expected a much greater film from Francis Ford Coppala.",The Rainmaker

139,galaxygirls,details overlooked,9,21 September 2006,"The movie is really well-written and has ""box office hit"" to its calling. Andrew Shue, the athlete, and Matt Damon, the lawyer, and DeVito are charming and make an affable cast, and have characters that do them justice for the length of the movie and the storyline. The usual details that would become crucial in attaining a wider appeal can be put aside for a hit that becomes that actors and their cast. The characterization of the lawyers in the movie, however, becomes trying, in that there is the sense of professionalism that comes with making such a movie hit and lacking the formality that follows the turn of events in the movie, it becomes more appropriate to focus on the acting, rather than the ""making of the movie"" or other genre that allows for a hit about lawyers.",The Rainmaker
140,Plungedplummer,The Rainmaker Rain Entertainment,8,21 January 2007,"The RainmakerIn The Rainmaker by John Grisham, Rudy Baylor, an average young law student played by Matt Damon, struggles to find work in a city where it seems that lawyers outnumber the rest of the population two to one. Desperate he receives employment from a notarize lawyer nicknamed ""Bruiser"" played by Mickey Rourke. Rudy meets Deck Shifflet played by Danny Devito, a lawyer who has failed the bar exam six times and is forced to fly under the radar in order to practice law. A claim denial from a major insurance company, which at first seems simple enough, is dumped on Rudy and Deck. A mother who has a son dying of Leukemia desperately needs money from the insurance company to pay for a crucial bone marrow transplant. As Rudy and Deck further investigate the case, they come to realize that they are in way over their heads. During the preliminary trial, the insurance company sends its big guns, a battalion of over paid top notch lawyers headed by Leo F. Drummond played by the infamous Jon Voight, who played an equally villainous role in The Manchurian Candidate. Rudy and Deck struggle to unearth the secrets lurking in the shadows of the insurance company, each time they think that they have found a lead, the insurance team of lawyers seem to have a rebuttal, leaving the two grasping at straws. The acting in this movie is superb to say the least. Matt Daemon cleverly gives his character the look and feel of an average man, trying to find his way through life. Danny Devito plays an excellent supporting role, playing as a mentor to Rudy and providing crucial transitions through out the story. Jon Voight makes a fantastic villain, by duplicating a stereo typical lawyer. When it came to camera work, the director (Francis Ford Coppola) made an excellent choice in keeping it all very simple. There are no fancy transitions or filters to distract viewers from the experience. The cameras always focus more on the actors themselves rather than what is around them. Both lighting and the set scheme are kept simple. The sets consist mostly of court rooms and small office spaces, sets designed not to detract from the action. Lighting seemed almost absent from the movie, the light seemed give itself more of a natural feeling to the movie, rather then being artificial. The music gives a real sense of time and place for the viewers of the movie. The music is very slow and easy going, there is no heart pounding action music. The music is mainly used to make nice transitions. Overall this movie is well made and worth viewing. The movie has an all-star cast that interacts well off each other's acting. Set schemes are simple and with good reason. The Rainmaker is more of a courtroom drama rather then a movie. Viewers who enjoy television shows like Law and Order will like this movie. Viewers looking for heart pounding movie with lots of explosions, will not find this movie interesting.",The Rainmaker
141,Victek123,A poor adaptation of the book,3,6 March 2007,"I read the book, so I was surprised at the movie's inconsistencies. It is quite faithful to the sequence of events considering that a great deal has to be fit into a couple of hours. Necessarily, there is plot/character compression, but it doesn't detract significantly from the story. The real problem is the portrayal of the court case between the Blacks and Great Benefit. In the book there is no doubt that the executives of Great Benefit are utterly wrong, nor is there any doubt that they are going to be soundly thrashed. What makes it a great read is the righteous pleasure we get as the execs at Great Benefit are caught lying over and over again, and are forced to face their wrong-doing. Unfortunately, the movie makers do not trust the material here, opting instead to create a fake crisis. They make it appear that Rudy and the Blacks might actually lose the case by first destroying the testimony of Jackie Lemanczyk, and then saying that Donny Ray's leukemia was a type that would not be cured by a bone marrow transplant. This is completely contrary to the book and greatly damages the integrity of the story. It is stupid and unnecessary. Also, there is a real problem with the fight scene between Rudy and Cliff. In the book Rudy mortally wounds Cliff in self-defense and Kelly tells Rudy to leave to avoid the police. In the movie though, after Rudy leaves we clearly hear (off camera) Kelly hitting Cliff again with the baseball bat. The implication is that Cliff wasn't dead yet and Kelly was finishing him off. Why did they think that having Kelly make a calm, conscious choice to kill Cliff was a good idea? This is really wrong. This movie had the potential to be great, but instead is mediocre simply because the writers did not trust the material. Too bad! And by the way, why did they play such inappropriate music during the first half of the film, as if it was supposed to be a screwball comedy? Awful!",The Rainmaker
142,LThomason5915,I thought a lot of this movie ...,10,21 January 2008,"for several big reasons pertaining to myself: first Matt Damon looks just like my oldest son, they even share the same mannerisms,... second, I graduated from a small college in Tennessee, usually no one outside this area has ever heard of it, and you can imagine how shocked I was when in the movie Matt Damon tells his future girl friend that he graduated from my college too (Austin Peay State University),... third, I can identify with Matt Damon's attempt in seeking a job and ending up with a Bruiser Stoner like character right out of college as the very same thing happened to me too except I was present when he was hauled off in handcuffs, ... fourth I also knew guys like both Danny DeVito and John Voight usually at the same time; ie ... one is trying to help you while the other is trying to get over on you. This is an excellent movie for a psychology major to watch ... that is ... because of the dialog and interaction of the many different character roles being played out.

Whether it be people in the background, an interesting-looking house, or backyard trinkets, there was always something to look at other thank the actors.Matt Damon was a great pick for the main character.

148,kritay,"Don't watch the movie, read the book.",2,19 January 2005,"This book should not have been made into a movie. Why does Hollywood always change everything? I have read this book at least 6 times and every time I read it it is just as entertaining as the first time I read it. It really irritated me the way Booker was not even mentioned, how when Rudy is first at trial he stumbles and asks ""leading"" questions of the witness. Was that really necessary? In the book, he stumbles a little, but he does NOT lead the witness. WHat an asinine move. The scene with Jackie at the hotel? You can't find it in the book. . .And my favorite part, the struggle with Cliff Riker. Completely embellished and unnecessary.Also, it was really annoying how they cut certain things out. You know, like Booker (a minor character in the book, but still interesting) and Rudy's job search and working at Jonathan Lake's firm. Stuff like the sex scandal with Jackie and Everett Lufkin. Miss Birdie not coming back from Florida because she's unhappy. Rudy's road trip to find the missing section U from Great Benefit. I mean, the trial was so not like the book at all. It made me regret watching it.another post mentioned that Rudy and Kelly's relationship was rushed along. I'm going to agree, and also say that I think the whole movie seemed rushed. These are just off the top of my head complaints. There are many more minor things I'm not even going to mention. However I will say this: THe only way to make this movie good, would take at least 4 hours, and include many more interesting details and capture the humor and character of Rudy Baylor better. THe book was wonderfully written and remains my favorite Grisham novel.",The Rainmaker
149,Paden03,"""The Rainmaker"" Fact or Fiction?",8,16 June 2005,"This 1997 movie covers domestic violence, lawsuits, and the process through an uncertain legal system. In ""The Rainmaker"" Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon), just out of law school, is hired to work in an office that chases ambulances. He works with Deck Shifflet (Danny DeVito), who is considered a lawyer wanna-be. He knows the ins and outs of being a lawyer, but has yet to pass the bar exam after six failed attempts. Rudy and Deck end up at the hospital looking for possible clients who might be potential clients. They sign up this new client and Rudy meets Kelly Riker (Claire Danes), who currently resides in the hospital from a beating from her husband. Rudy is assigned various cases to handle. One case being a new will case, and a lawsuit against an insurance company.Kelly Riker is a victim of abuse from her husband and of the system. She has been in the hospital on numerous occasions from being battered. Rudy and Kelly eventually click, and he tries to come up with ideas to help her leave her husband. Kelly did not leave before, because she is without support and her husband threatened to kill her if she ever left him.After leaving the hospital, Rudy eventually ends up on the doorstep of this elderly women's house. The woman wants to change her will. Her kids want her to leave them all of her money and she wants to leave all of her money to a church that she sees advertised on the TV. Rudy ends up moving in with her and helping her with things around the house. Rudy's first big case is about an insurance company which refuses to pay on any claims. The company's first mistake was not paying the claims. The second would be calling the client's mother Dot Black (Mary Kay Place) stupid. The third mistake was thinking that they could get away with it and trying to over power a new attorney. The case takes a dramatic turn for the worse when the complainant dies of leukemia. The case is now a wrongful death. I like this movie due to the everyday topics which they went over. The fact that they showed a little old woman trying to decide what she wants to do with her money and possessions. Those showing the kids trying to butt in, they are not nice kids, but in their minds they feel that they have earned it. She's not dead yet. I appreciated them showing a young man helping an elderly woman with everyday common housework.Claire Danes shows that when the system won't work, sometimes we have to escape. Matt Damon played the part of the overprotective lover shows through. This is a topic that is not discussed enough in today's society. It is more or less ignored until it happens to us or our loved one.I think that movie showed that there are cases as such that women cannot always leave their abusers. More times then not the system does not always work for them. The main part of the movie being the big lawsuit against the door to door insurance company. In today's world most people after so long would just give up and find other alternatives to taking care of medical expenses.With the insurance company, director Francis Ford Coppola shows a new attorney fresh out of law school, coming up against this big insurance firm and a big hot shot lawyer. Danny Glover playing the part of a judge had a good kick to it too. The judge actually giving the kid a break and allowing more time, and cutting the kid a break in some instances in trial. This movie shows that sometimes we can beat all odds and win against that big company.",The Rainmaker
