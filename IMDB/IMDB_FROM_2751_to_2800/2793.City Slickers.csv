0,TheLittleSongbird,"Adeptly played and funny comedy, that gently pokes fun at both midlife crises and the Wild West",9,19 May 2010,"I wasn't expecting to enjoy City Slickers as much as I did. I will say even before seeing the film I said to myself that it should be a good film at least. I mean it has a great cast, Billy Crystal, Bruno Kirby, Daniel Stern and Jack Palance, and it has a good director, Ron Underwood who directed the cult sci-fi classic Tremors. Plus I am all for comedy, as long it is sophisticated, funny and clever. I have seen films where it does promise to be all these things but fail.Just to assure you, City Slickers doesn't fall into that trap. I was expecting it to be good, I got great. I do agree that the sentimentality occasionally gets in the way, but essentially City Slickers is a funny and gentle comedy. It does poke fun at both midlife crises and the Wild West, but in a subtle way. The script is wonderfully engaging and does raise a number of laughs with some wickedly funny exchanges. One of my many favourites is the one between Mitch and Curly: ""Morning Curly. Kill anyone today?"" ""Day's not over yet"". I also loved the part when the men are talking about Curly and he is standing right behind them.Asides from the script, the film is beautifully filmed, with lovely scenery and cinematography, with some wonderful set pieces. And the music was lovely as well. Not only that, the film does have a very interesting story as well, it has a consistent structure with a nice ending to boot. Ron Underwood's direction is equally as adept as the performances. Billy Crystal, an actor who admittedly you love or hate is perfect as Mitch, his speech to the children in the kindergarten is another highlight. Bruno Kirby wonderfully balances humour and poignancy, and Daniel Stern plays with real goofiness and charm that was really appealing. Plus I loved Jack Palance in this film, he was a great actor, and he is clearly having a ball with this film.Overall, a wonderful comedy, helped by a great performances and adept direction and acting. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox",City Slickers
1,SnoopyStyle,Sweet funny movie,8,3 February 2014,"Mitch Robbins (Billy Crystal) is frustrated with his job selling ad time on the radio. Phil Berquist (Daniel Stern) is in a hateful marriage and found cheating with the checkout girl. Ed Furillo (Bruno Kirby) is settling down with an underwear model. The three friends decide to go on a getaway driving cattle. There they meet the beautiful Bonnie Rayburn (Helen Slater) who just was recently dumped, father & son dentists, Barry & Ira ice cream makers, and the harden trail boss Curly (Jack Palance).What makes this work is the chemistry between the three good comedic talents, and Jack Palance playing up his rough cowboy act. It has a sweet heart and Billy Crystal making jokes when he was still funny. It has some really funny insightful mid-life-crisis guy talk. And Jack Palance delivers some funny memorable punchlines.",City Slickers
2,classicsoncall,"""We're gonna go two hundred miles with a big, moving stink"".",7,14 March 2015,"So is this the quintessential mid-life crisis film or what? Not to mention the life long buddies team-up at the heart of the story. I watched this one again after many years and I couldn't stop cracking up. My summary line from Billy Crystal's Mitch Robbins was just one of the many quips that left me rolling, in fact I had to pause the picture when Crystal started his second eulogy - 'What can one say about Skyrocket and Buttercup...'.The casting of the principals here couldn't have been better. The era offered any number of possible players like Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd, Steve Martin, and on and on, but Crystal, Daniel Stern and Bruno Kirby gelled in a very believable way as a trio of friends who had grown up together and been there for each other through thick and thin.And then there's Jack Palance. Introduced as the mysterious and potentially deranged trail boss Curly. Palance and Crystal play off each other in wonderful fashion leading to a strange new friendship just before Curly's unscheduled ride off into the sunset. If you've ever seen the movie, you'll forever be inspired by Curly's embrace of the 'one thing'. If you haven't seen the film yet, you owe it to yourself.",City Slickers
3,lee_eisenberg,This may have been Billy Crystal's best role ever.,10,8 March 2006,"Billy Crystal puts a spin on the western as suffering city guy Mitch Robbins, going on a cattle drive with his friends (Daniel Stern and Bruno Kirby). Jack Palance, in an Oscar-winning role, is really funny as their cowboy guide (and I mean a real cowboy); he famously performed one-handed push-ups when he accepted his Oscar. Naturally, in the movie, there's a series of crazy happenings along the way.""City Slickers"" is a really funny movie. There was a sequel, but you know how sequels are; stick to the original. As it was, this was Billy Crystal's last memorable movie until ""Analyze This"". Also starring Patricia Wettig, Tracey Walter, Josh Mostel, David Paymer, Yeardley Smith (aka Lisa Simpson), and a very young Jake Gyllenhaal.",City Slickers
4,jboothmillard,City Slickers,7,11 September 2007,"The critics call it a blockbuster that cleaned up at the box office, and that it is a winning comedy, I can agree with this opinion, and I personally like it as a comedy boys-own adventure. Basically Mitch Robbins (Golden Globe nominated Billy Crystal) is the middle-aged radio adverts salesman, and with his best friends Phil Berquist (Home Alone's Daniel Stern) and Ed Furillo (When Harry Met Sally's Bruno Kirby) are all having a mid-life crisis. At Mitch's birthday party, they tell him about a two week trip they have arranged where they can become cowboys in the wild west herding cattle from New Mexico to Colorado, and his wife Barbara (Patricia Wettig) is actually letting him go, she doesn't want him coming with her to Florida to see her parents. There they meet other keen riders including Bonnie Rayburn (Helen Slater), and brothers Barry (Josh Mostel) and Ira (Mighty Joe Young's David Paymer) Shalowitz. There they are greeted by the one's who have experienced herding, Clay Stone (Good Morning, Vitenam's Noble Willingham) and Dr. Ben Jessup (Bill Henderson) with his son Steven (Phill Lewis). Then when opportunity kicks in, they meet the man who really knows what he's doing, Curly Washburn (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Jack Palance). As they travel the route with the herd in front of them, they are finding it hard work herding, but Mitch gets to Curly really well and he seems a nice guy under his ruff attitude. Soon enough though, Curly dies suddenly (kind of like Alan Arkin in Little Miss Sunshine, short Oscar winning role) and the gang have to take the cattle alone. Towards the end, it is only Mitch, Phil and Ed left from the whole gang, and they go through tough terrain, but they and the cattle do make it. It appears that the cattle are going to become meat, but there is a happy ending with all characters going back to their lives with some new found hope in the future, and Mitch brings home the calf he helped deliver, Norman. Also starring Tracey Walter as Cookie, Jeffrey Tambor as Lou, The Simpsons' Yeardley Smith as Nancy, Total Recall's Robert Costanzo as Sal and young Jake Gyllenhaal as Danny Robbins. There are some good giggly moments, and although the sentimentality (characters bonding and sharing their feelings) can slow the story, I kind of like it, and this is a very entertaining comedy adventure. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. It was number 86 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!",City Slickers
5,ccthemovieman-1,These Guys Are Clueless,5,21 December 2006,"Like most people, I really enjoyed this the first time I saw it. It was a ""good, solid comedy with some melodramatic moments and action all mixed in effectively,"" I put in my notes back then. ""Jack Palance steals the show,"" I added. ""It's just a fun movie to watch.""Well, some 5-7 years later, at a look on the DVD, this film lost a lot of its appeal to me. I guess I changed; I know the film didn't. It just appeared so blatantly secular in everything, it became ridiculous. Billy Crystal - and this is typical of all his comedies - and his buddies look at the world in an extreme worldly manner.In between the laughs in this movie are the guys (Crystal, Daniel Stern and Bruno Kirby) expressing their viewpoints on life, marriage, happiness, relationships and ""the secret to life,""as it's literally put in this film. Even though it's a comedy, and some of the viewpoints are said strictly for laughs, this is an angry film with these men always mad, always confused, bickering, swearing at each other, etc. That loudness mixed with the profanity just doesn't make this a funny movie any longer. The sequel is far better.In here, all you have is a warped look at life from people who don't have a clue about what it's all about....but think they do.",City Slickers
6,rmax304823,Curly Was A Beacon For All Of Us.,6,22 November 2012,"Billy Crystal is a nice suburban guy -- loving husband and father -- but it's his birthday and it precipitates a mid-life crisis of the ontological type. ""What's it all about?"" A somewhat reckless friend, Bruno Kirby, convinces Crystal and the equally stodgy Daniel Stern that they all need to live in the unfolding moment. Running the bulls in Pamplona doesn't work so the three of them sign up for a summer's job at a working cattle ranch run by the sympathetic but earthy Jack Palance as Curly.The three aging boys are working with a bunch of other city slickers, including Helen Slater, who is there chiefly to prove that the guys are heterosexual. Everyone undergoes what people call ""learning experiences"" when they happen to someone else, and ""humiliations"" when it happens to themselves. There's grappling, insults, a stampede, and a death that results in a burial under a crude wooden cross in the middle of the scruffy desert. That's Curly's grave. But his spirit guides them the rest of the way as they move the cattle through the wilderness and grow up. It was done before in a more serious vein in ""John Wayne and the Cowboys."" But this is a family movie and not to be taken so seriously. No matter how absurd or dangerous the situation, the script provides the city slickers with wisecracks and funny expressions.Palance is good. He almost always is. And Bruno Kirby and Billy Crystal are convincing, though not all of the jokes sparkle. There's a cute calf modeled on Bambi. Ugh. I rather lost interest with Curly's demise but it ought to entertain the kids and those who are undergoing mid-life crises. It must have been successful at the box office because a sequel soon appeared, hampered by the fact that Curly, the central figure, was already dead.",City Slickers
7,Tweekums,A modern comedy western,9,9 April 2020,"New Yorkers Mitch, Phil and Ed have been friends since childhood and regularly holiday together; as the film opens they are taking part in the Running of the Bulls in Pamplona. A year later Mitch is going through a midlife crisis; henpecked Phil has been caught having an affair and Ed has another young girlfriend. At his thirty ninth birthday party Phil and Ed give Mitch a present... they are to take part in a two hundred mile cattle drive between New Mexico and Colorado.The three are joined by similarly unlikely new cowboys and soon start to think that they might have made a mistake. The drive is to be led by grizzled old cowboy 'Curly'; who is rumoured to have killed a man and appears to take an instant dislike to Mitch. Over the course of the drive various challenges must be faced; some expected some surprising and potentially dangerous.I remembered this film as a comedy, and it does provide a good number of laughs... it is also much more than that. It is a buddy movie, and not just between the trio of friends, it has some genuine thrills and perhaps most surprising it is a genuine modern western not just grown men playing at being cowboys. The three main characters; Mitch, Phil and Ed played Billy Crystal, Daniel Stern and Bruno Kirby, are enjoyable to watch but it is Jack Palance's Curly that proves to be the film's most memorable characters; the scenes between him and Billy Crystal are particularly good. As with any good western there are moments of danger; a scene involving a river crossing provides a notable example. The locations used are impressive and add to the 'real western' feel. Overall I'd definitely recommend this character led comedy; especially if you are a fan of the western genre.",City Slickers
8,blanche-2,three men in mid-life crisis go on a cattle drive,8,13 June 2013,"A wonderful, wonderful film, and if you're my age, you'll cry.From 1991, ""City Slickers"" stars Billy Crystal, Daniel Stern, Bruno Kirby, Jack Palance, Patricia Wettig, and Helen Slater. Three men (city folk) whose lives range from unhappy to disastrous go on a two week holiday in the wild west driving cattle from New Mexico to Colorado. There, on the open range, away from their responsibilities, they can perhaps sort out what they want and who they are.Crystal is Mitch, a happily married man with children who hates his job and is depressed most of the time. When he gets a 30th birthday gift from his pals to do the cattle drive, his wife (Wettig) insists that he go rather than visit her family. If he hesitates, it's because his friend Ed's last idea, of running with the bulls in Pamplona, was a horror.Phil (Stern) is humiliated at Mitch's 30th birthday party when a woman who works for him comes in and announces she's missed her period, thus causing his wife to dump him on the spot - though they've been miserable for years.Ed has a lingerie model girlfriend who wants a family, but he's having trouble making a commitment.So all three go.There, they meet some real cowboys, and the oldest one, Curly (Palance), is one tough cookie. But Mitch is able to spend some time with him, and Curly tells him that only one thing matters. Just one. But you have to figure out what that one thing is. When Mitch has a crisis, he finally finds out what it is for him.I really loved this film. It was absolutely hilarious, with some of Billy Crystal's fabulous delivery, and yet very touching at the same time. A perfect combination, something that's not always easy to achieve. Very well acted and directed, the film moves along beautifully.Highly recommended. Full of wit, with some excitement, and poignant moments.",City Slickers
9,Quinoa1984,"Classic, just classic",7,22 July 2001,"City Slickers is one of Billy Crystal's best comedies, if not possibly his best.  He plays a businessman who is going through mid-life crisis, as is his friends played by Daniel Stern and Bruno Kirby.  So, they decide to go on a cattle drive to try and get things together in they're heads.  What shows is hilarious and interesting as well.  A consistently and uproariously funny comedy that will be funny for others to watch in future years.  The cow birth scene is most memorable scenes, but really memorable lines are scattered throughout.  A",City Slickers

11,hitchcockthelegend,Go and find your smile.,8,12 September 2011,"City Slickers is directed by Ron Underwood and written by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel. It stars Billy Crystal, Bruno Kirby, Daniel Stern, Patricia Wettig, Helen Slater and Jack Palance. Music is by Marc Shaiman and cinematography by Dean Semler.Mitch (Crystal), Phil (Stern) and Ed (Kirby), three everyday hard working guys going through a mid-life crisis. Choosing to go on a two week vacation to the Wild West where they will drive cattle from New Mexico to Colorado, the three men and an assortment of other vacationers meet Curly (Palance) who will teach them to become Cowboys. But the journey will not just see them learn the art of a cattle drive, it will be also be life affirming for a number of reasons.The theme of a voyage of self discovery is hardly new to cinema, but immense credit goes to Underwood and his team for creating a funny, fresh and heart warming entry into the collection. Planting this out of place group into a Western setting, beautifully realised by Semler's photography (actual New Mexico & Colorado locations), allows for much comedy and detailed character driven drama. The nods to classic Western films and TV shows is evident, but it's the about turn of watching normal tourist types attempt to emulate the likes of John Wayne et al that keeps the film from stagnating. The cliché's from some of those Westerns, the kind that these city folk would know only via the silver screen, come thick and fast, but with a great script to work from, the on form cast provide a true family winner of a picture.The complaints are small when judging the film as a whole, but only having one woman character in the group is a disappointment, for even though Slater is perky and crucial to the group dynamic, it still feels like there's a missed opportunity by the makers to broaden the narrative with at least another female in the mix. But with the central theme being that of male mid-life crisis, it's not hard to understand why the focus is fixed firmly on the principal male characters. Palance won the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for his affecting turn as leather faced Curly, it's a sweetly underplayed turn that although too short as regards screen time, is none the less as memorable as some of the lines and scenes in the film are. City Slickers is slicker than most, especially for us men of a certain age! 8/10",City Slickers
12,Theo Robertson,Different From What I Expected,6,11 January 2006,"Remember when this was released in the cinemas ? Remember what two scenes they played in the trailers ? "" Apologise "" "" No "" Out with the throwing knife "" AAAARRRRGGGGHHHH. I APOLOGISE !"" and "" We're going into the wilderness with a lunatic .He's behind me , isn't he ? "" Which led me to believe we'd be watching a film comedy centered around a bunch of wannabe cowboys from the city being guided through the New Mexico wilderness by a psycho called Curly . Considering these two scenes were very prominent in the trailers and adverts and the fact Jack Palance won an Oscar for his part as Curly this unfortunately isn't really what the movie is about Three city slickers ( Hence the title ) are having a mid life crisis . Well two of them are - the other is suffering from getting caught committing adultery - so decide to take the opportunity of a once in a life time working holiday of a cattle drive . The first half hour is taken up by introducing the characters , a sort of chick flick for middle aged men , the second half hour sets up the story proper while the third half hour revolves around men doing what men have got to do and starts to descend into unneeded sentimentality with large eyed calves staring into the camera . What stops this from ruining the film the use of some smart dialogue . But CITY SLICKERS could have been so much better if it had a slightly more sadistic edge",City Slickers
13,FlashCallahan,I made a cow.....,7,19 April 2016,"Mitch is a middle aged big-city radio ads salesman, and he and his friends Ed and Phil are having mid-life crisis.They decide the best birthday gift is to go on a two week holiday to the wild west driving cattle from New Mexico to Colorado.There they meet a cowboy called Curly, who not only teaches them how to become real cowboys, but also one or two other things about life in the west.....City Slickers was one of those sleeper hits that came out of no where back in the days when a films pending release wasn't hyped up within an inch of it's life thanks to forums and the internet.All we had then was seeing a trailer at the actual cinema and seeing a poster somewhere on a bus stop.And it's clear to see why it was just so successful, everybody is just having fun, and it's just an easygoing film with rarely an element of danger for our three characters.It's just a film about people thinking that maybe life may be greener on the other side, and them just going on a big holiday to learn some life lessons and get over themselves.Crystal as usual is wonderful, but he's a marmite actor, you'll either love his cocky humour, or you'll just want to smack him in the face.Heaven knows why Palance walked home with an Oscar, he's good, but other than mumblecoring his way through his lines, he's just their as a friendly antagonist to Mitch.It's aged pretty badly, the yuppie element to the film is pretty cringeworthy now, and it's just too neatly wrapped up come the end.as if Daniel Stern would get with Supergirl......",City Slickers
14,Wuchakk,"""Go and get your smile back""",6,22 January 2017,"Released in 1991 and directed by Ron Underwood, ""City Slickers"" is a Western dramedy taking place in modern times (1991, that is) starring Billy Crystal, Bruno Kirby and Daniel Stern as three buddies from the New York City area who are experiencing mid-life problems and decide to take a two week vacation driving cattle from New Mexico to Colorado to find their mojo. Jack Palance plays the tough leader of the cattle drive while Patricia Wettig plays one of the wives. Helen Slater and others are along for the ride.This was a hit at the time but, seeing today, it was a little overrated. Still, it's a solid dramedy mixing amusing moments with somewhat poignant insights on life. While I'm familiar with Crystal, this is the only movie I've seen him in and he plays a quality everyman. Wettig is striking and Slater is winsome, but the latter is prematurely removed from the main events.The film runs 113 minutes and was shot mostly in New Mexico, but also Colorado, New York City and Universal City, CA.GRADE: B or B- (6.5/10)",City Slickers

17,StevePulaski,A fun comic western by the man who knows fun comic westerns all too well,8,23 July 2013,"Few other comedic filmmakers understand the west on a comedic, farcical level than Ron Underwood. Just a year before directing City Slickers, Underwood directed one of my favorite contemporary comedy/horror films, Tremors, about a small, rather unpopulated town in Nevada being literally swallowed by mutant, underground worms. The film was not just fun to watch, but fun to imagine that deep underground there are large, unearthly worms that have remained undetected by elaborate seismographs and are now resurfacing to swallow anything that could cause a detectable vibration underground. Needless to say, after watching it when I was eight, I took extra-quiet steps.And here's City Slickers, a comedy that uses the wild west as a background for numerous visual gags, snappy wordplay, and a trio of great performances. The three guys are Mitch Robbins (Billy Crystal), a radio advertiser who is experiencing his midlife crisis after turning thirty-nine, Phil Berquist (Daniel Stern), who is stuck in a sexless marriage in the midst of managing a grocery store, and Ed Furillo (Bruno Kirby), a womanizer uncomfortable with the notion that there is a time to ""settle down."" On his birthday, Mitch is given a present from his two buds which is a vacation down on a southern cattle drive. Reluctantly, he accepts, and before they know it, they are defending the cattle drive in true western fashion.Billy Crystal is an ideal character for Mitch. He has the right balance of comedic wit and dramatic potency to make a character like this work well on the basis of being a sadsack but also a compelling lead. Stern and Kirby work well in the supporting characters, mainly because they themselves have good comedic timing and work well off of Crystal's lead.City Slickers works better than another western farce by the name of Three Amigos, which was stunningly mediocre in its inclusion of three hilarious comedians - Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, and Martin Short - and successfully finding nothing interesting to do with them. The film drifted from one stale setup to another, falling flat on its face, before stumbling over to the next contrived setup and doing the same. Too many instances in the film were dry and the laugh to actor ration was surprisingly very low.City Slickers works because writers Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel know how to effectively utilize their talent and give each character sustainable depth and energy to run for the near-two hour runtime the film holds. In that time, the film is often funny, kind of poignant, a little overlong, but heartfelt all the more. It's some kind of minor miracle this was well-received by a general public.Starring: Billy Crystal, Daniel Stern, and Bruno Kirby. Directed by: Ron Underwood.",City Slickers
18,MovieAddict2016,Deeply Intelligent and Funny!,8,10 July 2003,"""City Slickers"" is a character-driven story, told with extreme charisma and truly funny, yet deep characters. It tells the tale of a man going through a mid-life crisis and how he deals with himself.Billy Crystal is Mitch, the guy going through a depressing point in his life. Daniel Stern is his best buddy Phil, a worrywart who is owned by his wife. And Bruno Kirby is Ed, his other best friend who has a lust for younger women, and a lust for outrageous and crazy adventures. Such as the bull run in the beginning of the film, or his idea for a skydive.Mitch starts to suffer greatly with his newfound mid-life crisis. Phil is caught having an affair with a grocery store clerk by his wife. Ed is...well...Ed. So on Mitch's 39th birthday, Ed and Phil reveal that they have bought Mitch a spot on a cattle run, and they're coming along, too. They'll be driving cattle just like real cowboys.Mitch is unimpressed, but his wife insists he go to relieve stress. Mitch tries to get out of it by reminding her of his promise. ""I told you I was going to stay with your parents,"" he says. ""You hate my parents,"" she says.So off Mitch, Phil and Ed go, out to a cattle ranch where they meet Curly (Jack Palance), a homicidal cowboy who freaks Mitch out. Laughter ensues. And after that, more laughter.The cattle drive begins, and eventually things go hay-wire. Curly dies. The two other drunk leaders flee for their lives. Mitch, Phil and Ed are left with two fat ice cream inventors (a la Ben & Jerry), and an attractive woman who Mitch cannot get near because he is married. She says hello to him. ""I'm married,"" he replies.I watched some of ""City Slickers"" about four years ago and wasn't too impressed. Perhaps it was because the TV version cut everything out. This time around I absolutely adored it, it is truly one of the best comedies of the last ten (now fifteen) years.Billy Crystal is perfect as Mitch. I love his demeanor towards life, his grim outlook on things. Like the speech he gives to children in a kindergarten class. Priceless.The entire cast is excellent, and only the last ten minutes of the film fell apart a bit, in which you get a quite typical ""I'm over it, I'm a hero"" moment where Mitch comes to terms with himself and almost drowns saving a calf, which makes him look more like a suicidal idiot rather than someone coming to terms with himself.But the rest of the film is 100% excellent; funny is an understatement. The characters seem very real, something rare for a comedy these days. ""City Slickers"" is definitely one to see. If you still don't want to, I can only say one thing: ""Helloooooo?!""4.5/5 stars -John Ulmer",City Slickers
19,DKosty123,Just 1 Thing,7,10 February 2007,"Too often, this movie is thought of as just being Mr. Marvelous- Billy Crystal's film. While it it, the film actually holds up a good entertainment. It doesn't have enough Jack Palance but it has enough about life & a mixture of drama to make it a good film.Rather than just trying to put Crystal's comedy on film, this film follows the stories of 3 frustrated middle aged men & why they need to go out west for 2 weeks & be in a cattle drive. The themes are a little mature for the youngest kids, but for teens & above it works really well. The pacing & the films messages are good.This will never go down as a great film, but it is a solid good one that is about just 1 thing - living life. Once you figure out how to live yours, that is the message from this film. It has enough laughs to enjoy too.152",City Slickers
20,ElMaruecan82,"Sometimes, we should all 'have a cow' ..",9,11 December 2012,"As a guy who just turned 30, got himself married and gave up many crazy projects in order to convince the woman of his life that he's ready to raise a family, I'm probably sure I would end up like Mitch Robbins when I'll turn 39, or like his best friend Phil, or who knows, maybe like Ed. Yes sir, maturity, responsibility, practicality turned ""City Slickers"", a film I laughed at a lot when I was a kid, into a real eye-opening experience, the laughs are still intact, but the whole existential thing cut to my heart, as it never did, making some parts depressingly predictive. This is to the credit of ""City Slickers"", a great comedy with an original premise; three white- collar New Yorkers decide to spend a two-week vacation, herding cattle from New Mexico to Colorado, like real cowboys. Billy Crystal is Mitch, Daniel Stern is Phil and the late Bruno Kirby is Ed, the film screams '90's comedy' through these three faces, but their friendship is not just believable, I wouldn't believe it if these guys were not friends in real life. They share their childhood, baseball and fathers' memories (sometimes, the three at once) with the kind of passion that can only be expressed between pals. ""City Slickers"" features real characters, with real problems, real dilemma, and real fears, in a sort of psychological build-up that makes the whole experience even more insightful.Naturally, the film offers the obligatory gallery of supporting characters with their share of goofiness and sympathy, there is a father and his son, both ""black and dentist"" as states the son, making an issue of it before anyone would do. There are David Paymer and Josh Mostel as Ira and Barry Shalowitz, owners of one of the biggest national ice companies, a la Ben & Jerry's, and a pretext to a hilarious line when they're asked why it's not their faces that are featured in the boxes ""would you eat it if it was us?"". There's naturally the pretty blonde who might mislead the first-time viewers, but wisely enough, the script avoids any attempt of a romance (the kind that undermined even such classics as ""Red River"", to which ""City Slickers"" is a clear homage). These guys have enough problems, Mitch is in a middle-age crisis, contemplating the emptiness of his life, Phil lost his job and wife, Ed lives with a 24-year old girl who wants a baby, whatever the solution is, it's not a woman not yet anyway. ""City Slickers"" is a buddy movie and I guess that's what men would enjoy the most: watching guys they can all relate to, having a good time once in their lives, having a break. By taking them to a totally exotic setting, the film illustrates the miraculous effect communion with nature has on men. A poet said once, ""it's only when you get at the top of a mountain that you start climbing"", in ""City Slickers"", it's when they'll get at the end of the road that the road of their lives will start. This is what it's all about, a new start, with new decisions, new choices. Each one has to figure what the one thing he cares the most is and stick with it. Like the best comedies, ""City Slickers"" speaks a powerful and inspirational message about our capacity to change our lives without changing much, just the mindset. And one character embodies this spirit; it's Curly, the veteran cow boy, the toughest man Mitch ever saw. Curly is the character the movie needed the most. Without him, it would have been a bunch of city slickers playing cowboys, but Jack Palance, with his rock-graved face and inimitable grin, is the remaining link to this missed era. The film doesn't just feature a bunch of tender-feet herding a cattle, it's also the celebration of the cowboy spirit, the Old West as a part of history, of pop-culture and cinematic heritage. It's one thing to have the guys yelling ""Yee- haaa"" like in ""Red River"", or the trio humming the ""Bonanza"" theme. Jack Palance's face is the continuation of Hollywood's Golden Age. And when he said ""we're a dying breed"", I wondered if he was speaking only about cowboys or also about his generation of actors. Palance elevates the film beyond the simple comedy label, and that his brief performance earned him the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor proves how unforgettable he was. That's what a supporting is about, helping the main character to change, to see life differently, without doing much.Directed by Ron Underwood, ""City Slickers"" belongs to the best breed of comedy. It is full of priceless exchanges, like a Leone-like duel about ice cream-flavor, or an unforgettable stamped caused by a coffee thermos, many tender subplots like the birth of a little calf that made me for one second considering turning into vegetarian, and the growing complicity between Curly and Mitch. It's funny and warm, and although it does sometimes overdo the male-bonding thing, it never gets over the top. I felt for Mitch when he was wondering what his job was about, for Phil when he finally vented his anger repressed for many years on the bullies, and Ed who seems to incarnate this guilty pleasure, we, committed men, fantasize on? And the icing on the cake is the 'Magnificent Seven'-like score of the film which never seems out-of-place.""City Slickers"" is one of these few comedies that make you both laugh and think like ""Groundhog Day"" or ""Back to the Future"", but it doesn't take a fantasy device for that, just an Old West trip. And it's an invitation for each of us to find out this 'one thing' that counts the most, and which 'cowboy trip' would help us to figure out.",City Slickers
21,lesleyharris30,"Sweet and Funny, but there was definitely something Missing,",7,3 May 2015,"City Slickers is a good movie with a well written storyline and an impressive comedic cast. It has many very funny parts and it is also quite sweet as we follow the friendship of these three men, their is great chemistry between all three and you could tell they were real life friends. It easily could have been an outstanding, unforgettable comedy, which many people think it is, and though I did laugh a lot, I find it pretty forgettable and none of the quotes will stick with me. I definitely don't think Jack Palance deserved the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, he did a great job and Curly is a very likable character, but it simply isn't a performance, nor is it a movie, strong enough for an award of this prestige. It's certainly not outstanding or unforgettable, but City Slickers is fun while it lasts and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a comedy to kill some time. A man unhappy with his life is talked in to going on a cattle drive with his two closest friends. Best Performance: Billy Crystal Worst Performance: Patricia Wettig",City Slickers
22,zkonedog,"A Top-Five Comedy, But Also With Feeling",10,12 March 2017,"Strictly as a comedy, ""City Slickers"" is an 8 or nine star film. What makes it a 10/10 all-time classic, however, is how it touches on personal themes (especially for men) and makes you truly care about the characters.For a very basic overview, this film tells the story of Mitch (Billy Crystal), who undergoes a mid-life crisis. He works a job that not longer excites him, is almost 40, and can't keep up on his best friend's big adventures (the film opens with the trio of buds running from the bulls in Spain). However, an opportunity presents itself for Mitch to be able to re-capture his youth--two weeks herding cattle at a Dude ranch--and he reluctantly takes it. Over the course of the trip, Mitch and pals Phil (Daniel Stern) and Ed (Bruno Kirby) recapture some of the excitement and genuine camaraderie that seemed to have been missing from their lives.Like I said, strictly as a comedy ""City Slickers"" is hilarious. The jokes in this film are not the physical comedy of, say, Jim Carrey, but they expertly mirror the changes that each man is going through in his own life. The wise cracks are about one-per-minute and genuinely funny in a psychological, earned way.Only helping matters is the superb acting form the entire cast. Crystal, Stern, and Kirby do the heavy-lifting, but the entirely of the auxiliary cast are also spot-on perfect. They each in turn provide the perfect compliment to Mitch's ""old-age"" crisis. The addition of Jack Palance as the trail-hardened cowboy (sort of an homage to all his old western film roles) is the cherry on top--a performance that earned him an Oscar.Besides the comedy and acting, however, what always impresses me about watching this movie is the heart it ultimately possesses. The camaraderie, struggles, and real-life discussions between the characters really provides the emotional backbone of the film. Whether it's Mitch learning to find his ""one thing"" in life or Phil's complete breakdown, there are many tender or contemplative moments here. When Mitch, Ed, and Phil ride into camp with the rest of the herd in the film's final moments, you'll feel as if you've been on a real journey with them.I consider ""City Slickers"" to be perhaps a top five comedy of all-time in my book. While that makes up about 75% of the proceedings to be sure, the rest is compromised of real-life messages that will have you thinking a bit deeper than most comedies ever will. That is the true power of the film.",City Slickers

Since this was first made, our society has not changed so much as to preclude the need for opportunities of male bonding in a non-challenging, noncompetitive way. This work, through virtue of being relevant and meaningful, has worked its way into the movie collections of the masses; a position I feel it greatly deserves.The character development was wonderful, the script and dialog are compelling and witty, and the execution of the characters is beautiful, if not non-stereotypical. I find that many screenwriters intentionally create stereotypical characters in order to assist the viewer in easily identifying with the characters in their story.

26,barnabyrudge,First-rate comedy with some serious themes running just beneath the surface.,8,19 May 2004,"City Slickers entertained me enormously when I was a teenager because it has some good, solid laughs. Nowadays, as I approach my thirtieth birthday with frightening momentum, it still entertains me but it touches me too. That's probably what makes it such a great film: the skillful intertwining of humour, emotion and action. New Yorker Mitch (Billy Crystal) has reached crisis point in his mundane life. Bored by his job in the lower reaches of radio broadcasting and frustrated by the alarming rate at which years seem to be passing him by, he senses that his life has been a failure. His two friends, Phil (Daniel Stern) and Ed (Bruno Kirby) buy him a two week vacation for his birthday. No ordinary vacation, mind... a fortnight driving cattle across the Wild West, just like in the good old days. And it is while on this extraordinary vacation that the three buddies learn how to make the most of their mixed-up lives. The performances are uniformly excellent, especially Crystal who is in sharper form than ever before (or since, come to think of it) and Jack Palance as the leathery trail boss whose simple philosophies are surprisingly insightful. The scripting is outstanding, giving all the stars a chance to do some good character development, while providing terrific laugh-out-loud moments too. The film works on other levels too: the music is stirring, the photography spectacular and the editting very sharp (especially in a superb scene in which Crystal tries on an assortment of ill-fitting cowboy hats, only to opt in the end for his trusty old baseball cap). City Slickers is great entertainment, and one of the truly timeless comedy masterpieces from its decade.",City Slickers

30,triple8,"Comedy,Adventure,friendship and the wild west all combine to make one pretty good movie!",9,27 April 2004,"City Slickers-was when I first saw the previews many years ago, nothing I thought I'd be interested in.  Then I saw it. I was very much mistaken, I got into this right away with enthusiasm-this isn't just a good movie, I'd call it very good or even great. I didn't expect the depth and the beauty of the storyline that I got. One of the best movies Billie Crystal has ever made.City Slickers had moments of comedy that were actually funny. Really really funny. In addition, the emotional element that went along with the comedy just made it a that much more satisfying movie going experience. This is a movie that stands out by combining fantastic humor with a touching and relatable story about three friends and the search to find who they really are as people. And that this all takes place in such stunning surroundings just completes the movie experience. The dialogue was real and relateable and what was done so well, was how all encompassing the movie was-comedy,western,drama-everything was combined here and the results flowed perfectly smooth and were great. This script was superb.Identity is an issue that all people struggle with at any age-the way these people spoke to each other were probebly very close in nature to conversations going on right now. The cinemotography was magnificent and the characters were believable to the point where you either feel like you know them or you'd like to. I think that's enough reasons to dig the movie! In short-City Slickers is a surprisingly excellent movie that garners a 9 out of 10 for me and can be enjoyed by all.",City Slickers
31,eric262003,More About Dealing With Mid-Life Crisis Than Riding Off Into the Sunset,9,10 June 2018,"By the time you reach your forties, you start to have this belief that your days of fun and celebration could be winding down and fast. Yes for middle-aged men, ""City Slickers"" is not about lacing up your saddles dressing up cowboy duds and have an adventure out in the Wild West. It's about getting to enjoy as much about life while you can before it's too late. Even though it may have a cynical approach that middle-aged people are through with having fun according to the characters, ""City Slickers"" contradicts that approach by saying that happiness begins at forty and doesn't stop there. It also features an engaging performance by the underrated Jack Palance who also got his long overdue Oscar Award for Best Supporting Actor as Curly Washburn.Mitch Robbins (Billy Crystal) is hit the dreadful age of despair, 39. He fears there is more he could've done in life and fears he will never get that chance because of his advanced age. He's not alone in this as his friends Phil Berquist (Daniel Stern) and Ed Furillo (Bruno Kirby) feel the pinch as well. So the trifecta embark on a two week sabbatical to redeem themselves by saddling up their horses and ride off into the Old West from New Mexico to Colorado. They are led by an experienced cowboy named Curly (Palance) who shows them how it's done and gives them a life's lesson about the meaning of life while driving cattle to the open country.Even though the story is rich in character and performance, the plot is actually quite weak and predictable. We know that the triad will learn that that midlife isn't the be all to end all in the cycle of life. The real fun underlies within the interaction between the city folk and the country folk and though it might be a bit stereotyped from both party members, Curly's lessons about life lingers the whole way through.The juxtapose of witty comical banter and slapstick moments are carries the film in its entire 1 hr. 52 min. duration. The laughter is always there and holds up like a stampede can be caused due to the sound of a coffee grinder or the cynical gripes from Billy Crystal's Mitch. And sure the set pieces are there for a surreal goofy film that lampoons the Western genre, it all seems to be in place like it was intended to be. This may be due to the trio's realization that they had a good thing coming for them all along and that they are novice ranchers and are not cut out to hold this job. It never feels one-sided and gives equal balance between the witty banter and slapstick quality this movie has making it feel more organic and less forced.When it comes to who utilizes their acting chops at best Billy Crystal was perfectly cast as the lead role by using his cynical wit to his best capacity while succeeding in a deadpan delivery. Daniel Stern and Bruno Kirby are great as the unlucky Phil and the philandering Ed respectively. The trio offer their own blend of humour as they work off their humour upon each other as they each stand out on their own. The chemistry works splendidly for each other and the jokes and the humour makes the pacing of the film flow so much easily.As the smoke clears, the mass will truly say the scene-stealing performance is Jack Palance's performance as Curly. With his menacing smile and his frontier knowledge, this has been a role he has played over the course of his 60 year career. Not to undermine him in any way some of the more funnier scenes are when he's yakking it up with Billy Crystal. It's a bit questionable if Palance deserved an Oscar win in this role due to the fact he was Oscar-worthy in other performances.(""Shane"" and ""Sudden Fear"" come to mind), nonetheless his role as Curly was fun.To say that the film was dated would be a cliche on my part, but why lie about it? The clothes, the style and the trends are permanently locked in the early 1990's. Also the humour is a lot more lighter in tone even though there is some swearing, but it's handled with precaution. The delivery has a sweeter tone (not overly sugary) but tamer than compared to most comedy themed film you get today.In a nutshell, ""City Slickers"" manages to successfully convey a great lesson in life and by adding a humourous take on it. That way it wouldn't go off as being preachy or self-serving. It's not the most original script and does feel 1990's stamped, but with comedic performances from Billy Crystal, Daniel Stern and Bruno Kirby, along with the enjoyable performance by Jack Palance, this movie is a winner.",City Slickers
32,RNMorton,Typical Crystal,7,15 October 2003,"Classic Crystal/Ganz/Mandel, which means relatively equal parts schtick, smarm, pathos, okay humor and awkwardness.  Crystal, Stern and Kirby sign up for dude ranch, meet Palance (the highlight of the show) and end up with s ""life experience"".  You could do better or worse in movie viewing.  Then there's the big drop to City Slickers II, which misses Kirby, Slater and most of the other intangibles that were good about this deal.",City Slickers
33,blott2319-1,"Entertaining, but not laugh out loud funny",6,22 January 2021,"It's kind of weird returning to City Slickers now that I'm actually older than the characters in the film. I can appreciate some of the stress that comes with getting older, and I guess I understand the desire to seek out adventure before it's too late in life. It does seem like the message of this movie is fairly vague, bordering on being a complete cop-out that dodges any true moral, and therefore it lacks some of the emotional punch I was expecting. I enjoy all the camaraderie between the main characters, and seeing how they grow closer through this adventure. I'm not sure I fully believe that they could become as good at herding cattle as they seem to get in a matter of days in this film, but it certainly gives a triumphant tone to the end of the story. Unfortunately, that tone lasts less time than I expected, and never feels fully satisfying.There's no doubt that City Slickers is an entertaining movie, and it works because the 3 best friends all have charm and good chemistry with one another. I like the diverse characters we see from Billy Crystal, Daniel Stern, and Bruno Kirby. I'm not sure all the humor in the film works, though. There are several moments where I chuckled, but it fell short of laugh-out-loud funny. Of course, I have seen the film before and knew most of the jokes were coming, so perhaps the humor just lacks the kind of punch needed for repeated laughs. The strangest attempt at humor is just Billy Crystal's repeated nasal ""Hello."" I'm not even sure why that's supposed to be funny, but he goes there again and again. On the whole, City Slickers is still a decent comedy-adventure film that explores the causes and effects of a man's mid-life crisis. It's not an all-time classic, but certainly worth watching.",City Slickers

Whatever the age range is, every man who has ever reached a certain age on this planet has gone through a mid-life crisis. Whether they have it when younger, or around the early forties, we all go through a period when we question what we've done with our lives and feel trapped. In 1991's often daft, and regularly inspiring, ""City Slickers"" our three heroes all learn to appreciate life as they drive a herd of cattle to Colorado.Mitch Robbins (Billy Crystal) feels old. Waking on his birthday, he finds himself feeling trapped and miserable. His friends Ed and Phil (Bruno Kirby and Daniel Stern) also have problems in their lives. For Mitch's present, he and his two friends go on a cattle herding holiday to experience a childhood dream. When there, Mitch meets the stone faced Curly (Jack Palance) who helps him to find himself again.From the animated beginning standing out as a tribute to the Pink Panther series, ""City Slickers"" has more magical moments than you can count on your hands. Whether a hilarious line that you want to write down to remember, or a visually stunning scene to the film's excellent main score, you think of ""City Slickers"" and it's possible to think of a moment to treasure.The acting as well is top notch. Yes, it's true that Billy Crystal is one of these actors / comedians that you love or hate, but along with ""When Harry Met Sally"", this is one of his finest hours. Ultimately though, it's not Crystal that should be remembered. Bruno Kirby as Ed Furillo is a revelation, demonstrating a skill for humour and sentimentality at the same time. Again though, Kirby, despite giving such a good performance, is overshadowed by the stunning performance by worthy Oscar winner Jack Palance. Winning the award for best supporting actor (38 years after his nomination for ""Shane""), Palance is impossible to criticise as the mysterious Curly.Key to the success of ""City Slickers"" is that simple fact that it truly is an inspiring film. It's possible to create a long list of films which can be described as 'inspirational', but there's just something extra about this film which really hits the spot. Scenes where the three friends ride their horses to the amazing score, they just hit the spot and you find yourself wishing, even if just for a second, that you could be there. It's magical.Some people don't like Billy Crystal as an actor. That's fair enough, that's their choice. Crystal is one of those who you do enjoy watching, or you want to hit him. In ""City Slickers"" though, he pulls out one of his finest performances. Helped by the flaw free Jack Palance and the brilliant Bruno Kirby, Crystal leads the way in this often funny, often inspiring and always enjoyable film.

38,movieguy1021,City Slickers: 7/10,7,20 January 2003,"Referenced to in the popular comic strip `Zits' as the funniest movie ever, City Slickers is an ever-popular movie that spurred (pun intended) a sequel. It has Billy Crystal as Mitch Robbins, depressed ad guy at a local radio station. He just turned 39 and seems a bit far away from his family. When his two main friends, Phil (Daniel Stern) and Ed (Bruno Kirby) arrive at his birthday party, things get worse. Phil's overbearing wife Arlene (Karla Tamburrelli) finds out he's been cheating on her with someone at his place of work. To cheer everyone up, they give Mitch his birthday present-two weeks in Arizona learning to become a cattle driver/cowboy.Well, these durn city slickers don't know codswallop bout no cattle drivin'. But they soon learn, and the go on an interstate journey to prove their worth, led by intimidating Curly (Jack Palance). Along the way they find meaning and such.Leave it to Billy Crystal (who put a bad taste in my mouth after Analyze This) to make a funny movie that does have some phony sentimentality, but can still be meaningful. For the most part, the laughs weren't constant and played somewhat like a hit-and-miss comedy where most of them hit. The laughs that I got were good laughs, not little chuckles and snorts. Around the middle, though, it seemed to be bogged down by the clichéd formula of buddy/friend movies, where they go their separate ways but some calamity befalls one of them and they get back together. I am sick of watching formulaic comedies. Don't get me wrong, City Slickers is a clever idea executed well, but the obvious `twist' made me upset.And, of course, I could guess the ending. It was a comedy, and all comedies have happy endings, no matter what. I even could guess what happened to Norman.I thought Crystal was in great form here, before My Giant came out. He really knew his groove back then, but, unfortunately, he's lost it now. I hope he can find it. Stern and Kirby were also very good, with grade A chemistry throughout. Palance, I don't think deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar, but he was good as the leather-clad tough-guy cowboy. The other people who are on the vacation, such as D-list actor Josh Mostel, son of Zero, also were good. But Mostel brings me to my next point.There were too many forgotten subplots, with underdeveloped characters. Mostel's character Barry Shalowitz and his brother Ira (David Paymer) are able to find out the perfect ice cream flavor after any meal. Why? To pad its already bloated runtime of 112 minutes. Although they are small, who ARE the people who run the ranch? Questions like that will pester you throughout the movie.

The story is absolutely fantastic, the acting is great, the cast is superb and the comedy is hilarious!  The films' story is very entertaining and keeps you interested from the first second to the last.  This is basically a film about finding out what is important in your life and what means the most to you...and also having a few good laughs along the way.  Not only that, but there are actually quite a few touching scenes in this film as well.  Also, just as a side note, I love the opening credits to this film.  It isn't often that I can say that about a film.The director, Ron Underwood, really out-did himself with this film.  I've seen 4 of his 6 theatrical films so far and absolutely LOVED 3 of them (""Tremors"", ""City Slickers"", and ""Mighty Joe Young"", the fourth one, ""Speechless"", I have only seen once and I hardly remember it)!  I can't wait to see his next work.All the cast members involved in this film were excellent in their respective roles.  The main characters are played so well and have such great dialogue that you really feel like you know the characters.  This is, without a doubt, one of my top 3 favorite films starring Billy Crystal (the others being ""Monsters Inc."" and ""When Harry Met Sally"").  Billy Crystal is absolutely hilarious in this film, I laughed incredibly hard the first time I saw the film (and still do).  Daniel Stern and Bruno Kirby play the perfect buddies to Billy Crystal in the film and really have great chemistry between the three of them.  Jack Palance is another great touch in the film. The entire supporting cast was excellent as well, I won't get into each one though, because there are too many to list.  This film also yields a very young, up and coming, Jake Gyllenhaal of ""October Sky"", ""Donnie Darko"", ""Bubble Boy"", ""The Good Girl"" and ""Moonlight Mile"".  Jake does a great job as Danny Robbins.One other thing I think I should mention is the music in this film.  All the music is perfect!  You can tell that the music was chosen very carefully for particular scenes and it works so well.  I really enjoyed all the music in this film.This is another one of those movies that I highly recommend to everyone! There are so many good things about this film, I strongly recommend you see it.

But that was the young me, the teenage me, the still stuck in the 80s me, the me who'd rent a movie every single day on VHS and watch any old 80s crap, whether it involved Steve Guttenberg, Bobcat Goldthwait, Eddie Murphy, or Billy Crystal.Oh dear, has this movie aged badly. And how about Billy Crystal? He is still doing an incredibly bad impression of Woody Allen, just as he did in 'When Harry Met Sally'. But he's not funny when he whines, just incredibly annoying, not to mention dishonest. I am not buying his whining the way I buy Allen's. That was the first thing that struck me as watched this film again, more than 20 years after the first time I saw it. There is nothing really funny in this film. The ice cream fatso? The irritating high-energy sidekick? The insecure, slightly dumb, introverted sidekick? Oh, what a motley crew it is, conflicts between these personalities is guaranteed to result in funny scenes, right? Fat chance.See, the best thing about this movie has always been that gritty old cowboy, and that's the only redeeming feature of this film. Take that away and you have a film that makes you want to commit suicide. That's how boring, predictable, and outright irritating it is. And just how easily manipulated were we to enjoy that cheap crap about a little calf? Please. Oh, one more thing: Is Crystal meant to learn something during this film? I certainly didn't. And neither did he, but let's pretend we all did. Audiences back then certainly didn't care about anything - not that we are any better today, mind you. We are so cynical that we don't even pretend to care about love and the meaning of life.I'm giving this film one star. I do not like it in any way.",City Slickers
45,romanorum1,From Slickers to Cowboys,7,2 June 2016,"Mitch Robbins (Billy Crystal), approaching middle age, is a rather unhappy Manhattan radio station advertising salesman who decides to get away from it all by joining his two best friends, Phil Berquist (Daniel Stern) and Ed Furillo (Bruno Kirby), on an adventurous trip. Mitch's wife says to him: ""Go and find your smile."" Phil is a miserably married grocer who has committed adultery, while Ed, a sporting goods salesman, has recently married a much younger woman, explicitly a lingerie model. After Phil's wife told him that she hated him he replied, ""I hate you more . . . if hate were people, I'd be in China."" Ed has always suggested daring getaway vacations for the three friends, like running with the bulls at Pamplona, Spain (Ouch!). The latest adventure, Mitch's birthday present, involves joining a New Mexico working ranch (not a dude ranch), specifically a 200-mile two-week modern cattle drive that will end in Colorado. After the movie is a quarter over, the three friends finally arrive in New Mexico. There they meet five other slickers on the team, led by grizzled trail boss Curly (Jack Palance), who carries a large Bowie knife and seems to be a survivor of a century earlier. Next in command are two professional cowboys / ranch hands, T.R. (Dean Hallo) and Jeff (Kyle Secor), who repeatedly exhibit appalling behavior. But Curly teaches the dudes about life on the western range, especially during those idealistic nights around the campfire when the three guys sit back and reflect at their lives.There are various adventures, as when Mitch spooks the cattle into stampede with his modern, and loud, coffeemaker. Scenes include roping of stray cattle and Mitch helping to deliver a calf. Surprisingly, there is even a near gunfight. It concludes with a dangerous river crossing during a rainstorm. Along the way, Curly's smoking and eating bacon every day catches up to him, and he is found dead and is buried on the trail. The two professional cowboys take over for Curly, but they abandon the cattle drive. Mitch takes over, but everyone leaves except Ed and Phil. Will they make it to Colorado? Well, it all works out in the end as the men return to their eastern homes with a more positive attitude about life. The male-bonding works well here. The movie is ambitious and delivers with some great comedic lines without being baseless. Nothing is forced or contrived, and so the director gets it right. The actors are fine enough, but Palance as Curly steals his scenes with a relish! In the 1994 sequel, Palance plays his twin brother, Duke.",City Slickers
46,lagudafuad,"Whats the fuss, ? really",6,2 September 2012,"The fun in the movie is when Billy Crystal starts making jokes and not in the over 1 hour 50 minutes spent watching him do it.The movie is based on three men in their late 30s realizing that life has much to offer than what they are strapped with. What led to that and how they discover that is what writers Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel put together for us to watch. Both writers have been at it for a while with movies like Multiplicity (1996) and Robots (2005) under their belt.City Slickers did nab an Academy award though, Jack Palance went home Best Actor in a Supporting Role.The movie plot has 3 men who decided to go on a trip and be cowboys for 2 weeks which will involve hoarding a herd of cattle.In their journey they experienced death, birth and near death.Ron Underwood (Mighty Joe Young 1998) was the man behind the wheel in this one, a wheel I believe he held to loosely, the movie dragged for almost 2 hours, most of which were wasted watching the characters discussing pointlessly.Did I enjoy City Slickers?

47,mOVIemAN56,A very funny and intelligent film that keeps you laughing,8,16 June 2005,"City Slickers is one of those films my dad talked me into watching a few months back. I expected the film to be another boring, dry comedy of the 90's featuring an out-of-place cast (minus Cyrstal). But as soon as I watched the first few scenes I felt something about this movie that made me feel good. Pretty much the story goes like this.Mitch Robbins (Billy Crystal) is going through a mid-life crisis and is yearning to just get away from the family and work and go away with some friends. Mitch finally is able to find a get away out west on the plains, a cattle drive vacation. Mitch would help drive cattle from new Mexico to Colorado. Accompanying Mitch are his two friends, Phil and Ed (Daniel Stern and Bruno Kirby) who are also down on there luck. Things don't go well at first, the cattle leader, Curly (Jack Palance) isn't well-liked by most of the other cattle drivers but Mitch establishes an unlikely relationship with him. As the group drives cattle, with probably the strangest group of people you could imagine, more issues and morals are presented such as: friendship, respect, and family. The movie brings forth a lot of comedy, my personal favorite being th Shalowitz brothers who seem to now everything about ice cream and have competitions among themselves about what flavor goes best with each meal. Along with the comedy comes some fine acting by Cyrstal, Palance (Oscar Win), and Stern. The issues and morals presented are strong and easy to relate too. Palance finally won an Oscar for his role. He holds the base of the drama with Crystal helping at a few scenes.City Slickers utterly surprised me to be a well-written, well-acted, and above all else well-presented comedy/adventure/drama. It is easily one of the best comedies of the 90's and will remain in my book as a great film.City Slickers. Starring: Billy Crystal, Jack Palance, Daniel Stern, Bruno Kirby, and Josh Mostel.4 out of 5 Stars.",City Slickers

49,ragingbull_2005,"Feel good film, with Crystal in the form of his life",6,28 June 2020,"City Slickers was, from all accounts, a cultural phenomenon 30 years back. It earned 200 million world wide, in 1991, on a budget of 20 million dollars and cemented Billy Crystal's standing as one of the leading comic talents of the time, a reputation that was further solidified the next year when ""When Harry Met Sally"" came to town. It also happens to be one of the best ""feel good films"" that you can treat yourself to, in these saturnine times.It is, prima facie, a buddy movie. It is also a coming of ""mid -life crisis"" age film. It is peppered with essential wisdom about life & its associated responsibilities. It also pioneered the concept of going on tough trails to feel invigorated about life, a life which was getting crushed with the ennui of daily grind, poor choices and messy relationships.Jack Palance earned a richly deserved Best Supporting Actor Academy Award as the tough cowboy who introduces the city slickers to many of the truths. He is matched by Crystal (also the producer of this), who has the best lines and who is almost as funny here as he was in When Harry...The only bit that I found slightly disconcerting was the director's attempt to tie everything off quite deftly, at the end. It felt forced and a bit artificial.It is a delightful watch and is sure to leave you in splits because of its witty lines. Recommended.",City Slickers
50,macpherr,Castle Rock has produced great movies. I definitely like their productions.,7,9 November 1999,"Billy Crystal (When Mary Met Sally, Forget Paris) is  ""Mitch Robbins"" a happily married guy whose mom calls him early in the morning every birthday. Mitch's mom wakes up Mitch and his wife  ""Barbara Robbins"" Patricia Wettig (thirtysomething, L.A. Doctors) at the same time every year, on his birthday and says exactly the same thing. He loves his wife and kids but the monotony of life and his job are both getting to him. His wife tells  him to go on this trip with his friends and find his smile.  ""Phil Berquist"" Daniel Stern (City Slickers II, Home Alone), and Bruno Kirby (When Harry Met Sally) ""Ed Furillo"" are Mitch's best friends.  They go on this trip with Mitch to drive a herd of cattle across a part of the western U.S. There they meet this strange cowboy,  ""Curly ""Jack Palace (Shane)  and learn a lot from him. Jack Palace won an Oscar for this part.   ""Bonnie Rayburn"" Helen Slater (The Secret of my Success, Ruthless People) is the only woman on the cattle drive, and Phil falls for her after his life has turned into chaos, because he had an affair with a grocery clerk. The movie is fun, full of great lines. I find Billy Crystal very talented, family type a guy. Those who are not fond of Billy Crystal should try to watch his interview on the best show on television these days, ""Inside the Actors Studio,"" and get an inside view of him. I recommend this movie as well as City Slickers II. I have both tapes and enjoy watching them. I have had those tapes for years and still find them very enjoyable especially because the way the scripts are written. My favorite scenes: The birth of the baby calf.  The scene was not even shot with the two actors, Billy Crystal and Jack Palace  together.  Mitch meeting his family back at the airport. My Favorite Quote: Mitch:  ""Everything is a competition. Life is a competition."" Curly:"" The secret of life is, ( he points and looks at his index finger) that one thing! Mitch: ""Secret of life is that one thing, you have to figure out what that this is."" The movie was made by Castle Rock Entertainment that is Karl and Rob Reiner's company.

51,kyle-cruse,"Very funny, with some real-life lessons",8,29 January 2009,"Billy Crystal was never sharper and funnier than in ""City Slickers."" His hilarious comments, and so many funny situations, make this a very funny and entertaining movie. Co-stars like Daniel Stern really make the movie. I question an Oscar for Jack Palance, since his role as Curly the wise, old Westerner, is a very typical type of character that was really not that unique. Nevertheless, Curly does add some important and fun aspects to this film. I really do not care for a lot of the racy and suggestive material toward the beginning of this film, involving Billy Crystal's friends trying to get him to leave his wife and such. At this point, I almost stopped watching the film, but luckily I decided to stick with it. The remainder of the film is nothing but fun. Some of my favorite scenes include Daniel Stern getting overly angry at one of the bullies and some hilarious comments made at the graveside. One reason I really liked this film was the good morals the film turned out, including Crystal's decision to do better at his job and be a better father and husband. This adds a very touching element to the film that ties it all together and makes ""City Slickers"" entirely worthwhile. The sex-related material toward the beginning and middle of the film makes it not necessarily appropriate or appealing for everyone. Watch with discretion, but know that the eventual lessons in the film are positive.*** out of ****",City Slickers
52,richspenc,Good Crystal and Palance movie,8,28 February 2017,"I always liked ""City slickers "" due to the smart alec comments made by Billy Crystal (Mitch), Daniel Stern (Phil), Bruno Kirby (Ed) and Jack Palace (Curly). The scene where Lisa Simpson, I mean Lisa Yeardly walks into Mitch's apartment is still a classic scene to me. When you hear her talk in this film and shut your eyes you swear you're listening to a Simpsons episode. Yeardly never even put on an acting voice for Lisa Simpson, that high pitched voice was always her real voice. I wonder if anyone ever noticed when Mitch and Phil are talking about how he has to open his store up at 4am, and Mitch asks ""don't you have someone else to do it?"", and Phil says to Mitch ""Arlene's dad always wants me to do it. No free rides Billy boy, no free rides"". Did Phil call Mitch by his real life name, Billy as in Billy Crystal, on purpose, or was that an error done when filming? I always wondered that. Anyway, I always found Mitch's obsession with death and getting older interesting. Especially the scene when Mitch is talking to his son's fourth grade classroom and literally walking through each decade of life and the most accurate things that usually occurred during each decade. Every decade he mentioned had a ring a truth and was very funny with the way he put it. I read somewhere once that Billy Crystal in real life has had similar fascinations with the art of aging, and his character in Mr. Saturday night also had similar fixations. I still enjoy watching all of the out west portions of City slickers with the roughneck cowboys, the dentist father and son(""that's right, we're black and we're dentists, let's not make an issue about it."" His dad's response to him; ""they're not making an issue, you're making an issue""), I still find that funny. The ice cream brothers Ira and Barry (an obvious reference to Ben and Jerry's). I still never understood what the 'right' flavor of ice cream was, according to Ira and Barry, to go at the end of every meal. Isn't that always different for everybody? When Mitch asks them ""how do you know you're right?"", Barry responds ""Hundreds of outlets across the country, that's how I know"". That never made sense to me. How would the people who are selling the ice cream know what flavor ice cream people are eating after what meal? My favorite parts of the West sequences are, besides all the cows, and the constant mentioning of them, and besides Ed's fixation on the need to sleep with lots of different women instead of just one, are the scenes with Curly, especially with Curly and Mitch. Curly, while riding off with Mitch after the coffee machine/cows running away incident: ""You guys go ahead, I'll catch up"". Mitch: ""you mean we'll catch up"". Curly then gives Mitch a look to hint that he could be wrong. Mitch:""hi Curly, kill anyone today?"" Curly:""day ain't over yet."" Those comments were what helped make this film so good. About the secret of life, it's just one thing bit; realistically that is a little too simplified and vague to be taken as a serious answer to someone really struggling to find happiness, hope, and success in their lives. If finding the secret of life was that easy, there still wouldn't be so many unhappy and troubled people in the world. Mitch tells Phil and Ed that the secret is to find what's most important to you. Sometimes, what's most important is not that easy to get. What if what's most important is to make six figures a year, or to become an airline pilot, not everyone is gonna be able to achieve those things. I'm not saying that some people won't be able to achieve what's most important, I'm just saying it's gonna be a little more complicated than to just say to find that one thing. One last thing, Roger Ebert said that Jack Palace's character really seemed like a survivor of an earlier time. I don't agree. There were a lot of things about his character that were not that similar a match to typical early 20th century people, and I often watch films from the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s.",City Slickers

From the slapstick comedy to the one-liners to the sometimes subtle stuff, this film is highly enjoyable. A great cast as well. Billy Crystal is great, but Jack Pollance steals the show. Daniel Stern is perfectly cast as it seems, and everyone else does a fine job. A nice story, with a great script, infused with good directing.Overall, there's some moments that seem misplaced, but as a whole, City Slickers is a film the vast-majority of men will connect with, be they young or old.",City Slickers

55,alecwest,more complicated than meets the eye,10,17 March 1999,"I gave this movie a 10-rating.  Within what, at first, appears to be a simple comedy is a most important message delivered by Jack Palance (Curly). Happiness is not acquired through attainment but through aspiration ... or, as he put it, quote, ""Find out what that one thing is and everything else don't mean sh*t.""

The movie begins in Pamplona with three guys who have made a custom of going to strange places and performing tasks that they think will prove that they are still young. But their world starts collapsing and they decide to try to make a new start by going to New Mexico and join an old fashion cattle-drive, and the rest of the film continue with that. The acting performances is all very good and convincing and I'm sure that they all had a good time shooting this picture.

57,drunken_critic,Crystal funny?,5,9 April 2005,"I have come to the painful conclusion that Billy Crystal is not funny. At least he is not funny when he tries to be funny. Actually I think he is a good actor, but he is just annoying when he is trying to be funny. I laughed at situations in this movie, but I did not laugh when Billy Crystal tried to crack jokes.This movie was about a bunch of guys going through mid-life crises. They try to go on adventures to make their life exciting. I like that idea. I liked the scenes of running with the bulls in Spain. That seems like a romantic thing to do. I also liked that they end up going on a cattle drive, but the story really didn't go anywhere exciting. They deal with problems that really didn't excite me or interest me. I was really feeling bored at the end of the movie. I don't have Adult deficit disorder, but I was showing signs of it at the end of this movie. I was getting antsy, and I really didn't feel like paying attention to the movie. The ending was too boring and predictable.The most amazing thing about this movie is that Jack Palance won a best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance. How and Why? He was in the movie for about 5 minutes. How could he win? He played a cranky old cowboy that everyone is scared of, but I didn't feel it was convincing or worthy of an Oscar.",City Slickers
58,spenrh,"In this movie, there are cows, and plenty of 'em",7,22 June 2019,"This movie has cows, and plenty of 'em, and food that is hot, brown, and plenty of it. Both are quotes in the movie on the cattle drive that Billy Crystal's Mitch, Daneil Stern's Phil, and Bruno Kirby's Ed set out on, while dealing with confusion, and plenty of it. They each have different ideas on how to get the most out of life while dealing with their advancing ages. But none of them yet have really found out how to get the right feel out of life, how to find real inner happiness, or how to fill that empty confused feeling in their souls. As they're about to set off on their cattle drive, Ed proclaims ""out there, is all the answers"". Mitch responds (above mentioned quote) ""no, out there, are cows, and plenty of 'em"".None of the three men have found the answers yet. Phil's getting a divorce from a witch of a woman, after being caught committing adultry, and he knows as a result that the witch will get full custody of their kids and money. Before being caught and throughout their marriage, Phil's wife apparently never wanted sex, and she has watched over Phil so carefully that she makes him work 7 days a week at her dad's store and to go to work every day at 4am. She makes Phil literally set his watch to go off in ten minutes after he asks her if they can stay at Mitch's birthday party for ten more minutes.Ed is not only obsessed with daredevil adventures such as running with the bulls in Spain, parachuting from a plane twice as fast with a twice as small a parachute, and retracing Admiral Burns' treck to the North Pole, but he's also obsessed with bedding as many women as possible, even though he's dating a magazine model who worships him. And, Ed pressures Mitch to join him on his adventures, and he pressures him to sleep with other women besides his wife.Mitch complains about feeling lost, he's obsessed with aging to the point that he literally walks his son's fourth grade class through the common occurrences of each decade of life (each of Mitch's mentioned decade has a ring a truth, and with a funny witty remark in relation). Mitch has also lost his concentration and ambition to where at his job at the radio station, he puts up annoying commercials on the radio, and his boss demotes him to a lower position of authority. Funny comment from his boss about the annoying ""Pizza guy"" commercial, ""you're putting that commercial on the radio 3 times a night during rush hour, people are having accidents"". Also funny seeing his boss's face when he sees Mitch try to cut his ear hairs with a scissors (a follow-up from Mitch earlier complaining to his wife about how men start growing hair in weird places, such as in their ears, as they age). His wife tells him that she has been growing tired of him constantly being miserable. She tells him that she doesn't want him along on their usual annual trip to Florida, and that if he's not happier by the time she returns from Florida and he returns from the cattle drive, he and her are through.The cattle drive scenes make the main plot of the movie. Other characters are Helen Slater's beautiful Bonny (these movies always have to include ""the pretty girl""), Ira and Barry Shallowitz (ice cream store owners), and a couple of dentists.The movie also has a trail boss with a coronary and a bunch of drunks (as Ira Shallowitz quotes at one point). One of the drunks is an old coot who injures himself after getting drunk and crazy on his wagon. The other two drunks are the typical tough, drunk, fight provoking cowboys that have been seen in so many westerns. The trail boss with the coronary, who dies from one during the course of the movie, is Curly (note Phil's comment on Curly's death, ""the man ate bacon for every meal, you can't do that""). Curly intimidates Mitch at first, but soon becomes his inspiration with his claim on the secret to life. Curly's secret to life, ""just one thing"", is a little too vague and simplistic to be taken seriously in real life. But, this movie is a comedy and we just gotta go with that.Anyway, this movie has all the above mentioned characters, action, and plot points.

This movie has far too many serious parts and has a pretty corny ending for a comedy.  Don't get me wrong, it was still a good movie, but after loving the sequel, I was kinda disappointed in this one.     Jack Palance is fantastic in this movie and completely stole every scene that he was in.  He really is one of the most underappreciated actors that I can think of.  Bruno kirby simply doesnt belong.  Lovitz filled his role as the 3rd guy much better in the sequel and really stole the whole movie. Overall I would say this movie is somewhere between a 6 and a 7.",City Slickers

City Slickers is about two things: the bond between three long-term friends, all of whom are in their own way struggling with mid-life crises, and what is important in life.
From Curly's (Jack Palance's description of his perfect woman - a girl he'd seen from a distance once before turning his back deciding that THAT enduring image was ""as good as it gets"", to him dying in the saddle while doing the one thing in life he truly loved. How many of us spend most of our lives searching for ""the thing"" that will make us happy? Perhaps as Billy Crystal discovers when while nearly dying, rescuing a calf he birthed, from a set of rapids, the important stuff is right in front of us - we just need the right moment to see it - or perhaps many of us don't.This is the first 10/10 I've ever awarded, but City Slickers fully deserves it.

64,stephen_thanabalan_fans,Needed more of a slick out of mid-life crises...,6,2 March 2006,"Mid life crises bring out the worst in people and they certainly bring out some of the worst plots in story telling. Sure, the idiosyncrasies and character depth and development can make for compelling psychological analyses (of which Billy Crystal not only excels at analyzing, but probably churns out as his chief repertoire for comedy), but the plot lacks punch and drive. It has wit, it has pacing and comic relief but considering there are 4 Jewish or Italian actors of the finest comic calibre slicking out in a Western with names like Curly and with animal rights pretty much on the back hooves, the film shockingly fails to excite me. It's in a sense, too middle-agedly, if there's such a word- too slow moving. Sure, Daniel Stern's character and Bruno Kirby's character all suffer from the insecurities and hard knock disappointments of life and end up sharing great male bonding with Crystal in the wild west, but the general feel is that the filmmaker and scriptwriters could have done better. And how in the calico desert's eye Jack Palance could have won an Oscar for his role here is beyond me- he was just being...himself...Jack Palance for all the quirky advice and bonfire cowboy antics I saw! Perhaps the Academy was giving him one in a comedy as a mercy mock to make up for not giving him one in an earlier western. Nonetheless, I think if Part II 'The Legend of Curly's Gold' could have been combined and interwoven into this one it would have given it that edge, to bring it the much needed contrast in terms of really slicking out of their mid-life crises and into some real adventure.",City Slickers

I've been on a comedy binge recently, and perhaps watching this after Grumpy Old Men was a mistake, because despite being billed as a comedy, City Slickers is not funny at all. There are maybe three jokes that will make you laugh out loud, and they occur early in the film, afterwards the script transforms into what is largely a mid life coming of age story with dramatic elements interspersed. Even the serious dialogue which does take place feels more like an incomplete thought. The three friends briefly discuss marriage, kids, and work, in relation to their values. Later on all of their problems appear to be resolved, but it would've been nice for more discussion to have taken place to lead us to these conclusions, instead the obvious things happen on their cowboy getaway and it's somehow sufficient enough to change the characters and their outlooks on life. I give the film five stars because some people might enjoy a coming of age with mild action/drama elements, but as a comedy it's a complete let down.",City Slickers

Although this might be primarily a typical Billy Crystal comedy there are also some really heart felt moments slotted in every now and again, such as Curleys tale about the red head and the bit with Norman the calf when they're trying to cross the river.Even if you're not a fan of Billy Crystals movies you should give this film a try because it seriously is funny and i guarantee you won't be disappointed. Oh and i leave you with one last sentiment ""Hello...don't sew up anything thats supposed to remain open okay?"" Now if you want to know what the hell that was all about watch this film and you'll find out.",City Slickers

69,teacherlogan,The very best kind of comedy. One with heart,10,9 March 2007,"City Slickers is a fantastic movie. It is not just a comedy. It's not just a buddy film. Those have been made and remade. City Slickers has heart. Behind the smart cracks and slapstick comedic moments, this is a story of change. Entrenched in the film is the desire to be better; a better husband and father, a better friend and co-worker. The humor and fun of this film does not mask the tender moments of soul searching. Those moments make City Slickers better than most comedies.Mitch Robbins is a jingle writer in New York City who has become unhappy. He is unhappy with his job, unsatisfied with his family and questioning the purpose in his life. He is a walking mid-life crisis. Encouraged by his two best friends, and pushed out the door by his wife, he embarks on a two week long cattle drive at a vacation ranch. Under the watchful eye of the old trail boss 'Curly', the friends work out their issues while learning to rope cows, ride horses and other cowboy skills.I am not a Billy Crystal fan as a rule. His comic lines can seem forced at times, like he is trying to incorporate his stand-up routine into a film. But in City Slickers, Crystal is different. Crystal's character is disillusioned. He is withdrawn. Humor is his way of lightening the situation. It avoids the awkward moment. Curly calls him on it after Mitch makes a smart remark. Mitch responds that is ""just my way"". That one statement encapsulates his character. He is having a hard time communicating with his friends, family and workers. Humor is his disconnect. It seems forced because he is trying to force humor into a serious situation.The setting of a cattle drive gives City Slickers the opportunity for some great periods of dialog. When you're herding cattle for hours on end, you have a lot of time to think and to talk. We experience the bond between Mitch and his two friends during these conversations. The discussion of their ""best day"" is one of the best scenes in the film. In that simply exchange, we see into each character's mind. We really understand what makes them click.Mitch's subsequent conversations with Curly are equally moving. The movie is half over before we truly get to understand Curly's character. He is a true cowboy. He is not part of the experience; doesn't try to be. He is doing what he loves to do. Curly represents what Mitch and so many men like him are looking for. Curly is content and at peace. His life ""makes sense"", as Mitch puts it. Mitch appreciates that. As an audience, we do to. Most people go through their whole lives trying to make sense of it all.City Slickers is the kind of comedy I really appreciate. While there are some very funny moments, the film wants to do more than make the audience laugh. It wants to make us think. To think of that 'one thing' that makes life worth living. To think about all the meaningless cares that stop us from seeing the bigger picture. To think about how simple life can be when we focus on what's really important. To not take for granted the special people and moments in our life. City Slickers brings those people and moments into the forefront, amidst the chaotic backdrop of a cattle drive.So, despite the comic flair, City Slickers is a touching movie about what we value and what we should value. It reminds us that a good and fulfilling life is right in front of us. We only have to do a better job of appreciating what we have, not longing for what we don't. When it comes to living life, we are instructed to ""do it better, do everything better"". In instilling that message, City Slickers does it better than most comedies and better than most movies in general.",City Slickers
70,tommonster3k,A comedy of surprising depth.,8,12 April 2004,"This movie surprised me.  It made me laugh out loud a few times, but the reason I really like it is because of the parts where it gets more serious. And that is REALLY surprising, because usually when comedies throw in serious parts they come off as being really cheesy and sappy--the kind of stuff that makes one gag.But here, it works.  Billy Crystal pretty much just hams it up, and Daniel Stern does some of his usual... uh... Daniel Stern-ing.  And Bruno Kirby, well... he's the master of playing characters who are kind of annoying but somehow retain their humanity and a certain level of likeability.  That said, they're all playing just about the same character as any character they've ever played. Individually, that is.The relationship between these three men in the movie is palpable, believable.  And they have more depth than the usual comedy characters.  The best scene in the movie is when they're simply riding along, talking about their best and worst days ever.  This scene could be played for straight-up laughs, but it's not.  It is full of humor, but also human understanding. These characters have histories.  They've had their ups and downs.  They're hesitant to be vulnerable about their worst days, but when they talk about their best days, their faces light up as if they mean it.  As a bonus, the dialogue here has some rather profound insight into our perceptions of what makes a day good or bad.My second favorite scene is toward the end, when Crystal has to save Norman the calf from being washed away in a raging river, and the three men shift into cowboy hero mode.  Again, scenes like this in comedies usually come off as silly, the kind of stuff that makes you say to yourself, ""Of course they do the right thing and save the day and become better people and learn who they are.""  But this scene has real suspense and drama.  Why?  We care about the characters.  And good direction always helps.As for Jack Palance--I'm a little befuddled that the Academy gave him an award for playing Curly.  But that's alright.  He's fantastic in the role, and it's probably one of my favorite movie characters ever.  And the scene when Curly and Crystal's character deliver Norman the calf is very good, and even had me wondering, ""How exactly did they film this?""8/10 stars.  A comedy classic.",City Slickers
71,PennGirl,My Friend's Dad Wrote this movie...therefore it rules!,8,10 August 2000,"C'mon...ya gotta love the NY humor in this flick.  Besides, like I said, my friend's dad wrote it.  =)  But just to make this a legit review, I will say that the rapport between the three friends, Mitch, Phil, and Ed, is classic and acted so naturally.  They remind me of my uncle and his friends, who are all in their 40s but have known each other since childhood, and still act the way they did when they were 8.  It's a beautiful thing.",City Slickers
72,shayden2010,A Comedy That Is Important,9,26 June 2012,"After watching City Slickers, I found myself shocked that it only had a 6.7 rating. The movie is the whole package. It's funny, but it has moments that are very serious and important. If examining this movie, one could find many things, such as important views on death, life and why we're all here. But let's just examine the outer layer here. It is a movie that can make you laugh very hard, but think. Jack Palace's Oscar-Winning performance as Curly does not disappoint, and Billy Crystal is hilarious as always. The characters were likable and the script was near perfection. However, apart from everything good I have to say about this movie, it also felt incomplete. I just can't put my finger on what it needed, but something was missing. Otherwise,City Slickers is a great time and definitely one to see.",City Slickers
73,ScottyB,"""Stand By Me"" meets ""Groundhog Day""",8,24 January 1999,"Excellent. Funny, romantic, coming-of-middle-aged, must see.I had some difficulty trying to categorize this movie. It is extremely funny most of the time, but has an underlying emotional element throughout the film which can send you to a reminiscent mood at times. The beauty of this film is that it explores an uncommon theme among movie makers - the bond between male friends which is just as strong as the female version, but not discussed as often.Billy Crystal plays a typical bloke in that uneasy period between being ""one of the lads"" and being ""old""  i.e. coming up to his 40th birthday. We are drawn in to the lives of all the three main characters with the ups and downs of having lived it all, settled down, and remembered what our youth was like. To get an escape by going away with your old friends once a year to relive your youth - sorry ladies, but all us guys do it now and then - provides an excellent theme for this movie made better by the fact that most viewers will relate themselves to at least one character in the cast, from the lively funster who always has the bright ideas to the quiet lad who secretly looks forward to finding out what his mates have lined up for him this year. The fairer sex are not in any way left out of this character identification with characters from the middle-aged housewife through the feisty-but-dull teenager and back to to good ol' Old Dear - all smiles, reliable no matter what life throws at you.Without giving too much of the story away, it's difficult to say any more, other than I voted this movie 8 out of 10 and if you do decide to watch it, feel free to complain to me if you don't enjoy it - I don't expect any complaints for this recommendation :-)",City Slickers
74,ciocc1001,And the star of the movie is...,6,20 January 2003,"Yeardly Smith!Time has not been kind to this movie. The first half descends into caricatures, rather than acting. And given the fine cast, one expects more. The low point is when Nancy barges into the party with her incredibly whiny voice, and you think ""who is this incredibly annoying person?"" And then when I discovered at the end credits that it was Yeardly Smith I realized it was truly great acting. Hey, its not easy being THIS annoying. I guess this is what the director wanted. Fortunately, the movie eventually gets better as the characters gain depth through a personal self-discovery on the range sort of thing. Nothing like a little peace and quiet away from the city, eh? I think this was what the movie Grand Canyon was trying to get at in its crude sort of way.
My advice: If you get the movie, stick with it! It can only get better. And keep an eye out for Nancy!",City Slickers
75,retta_narwen,Great classic comedy feel good movie,9,7 September 2019,"I really enjoyed this movie. So many laugh out loud moments with such a great cast and Billy Crystal with the lead, he's just hilarious. Such a feel good film that really cheered me up. Has aged well and just overall great film!",City Slickers
76,telemationltd,Helped me find my smile,10,29 December 2006,"Simply, when your down and feeling troubled and you need a helping hand.......A film that will bring a smile to a sad face and have you shouting out loud.... Yes! The theme is middle aged blokes dealing with their mid life crisis via a cattle drive, but the film has a wider appeal to anyone who ever looked for the hero inside.Great musical score, with a nod to the classic western movies and TV shows. Our unlikely hero Billy Crystal is probably at his best, certainly on a par with when Harry met Sally. He has a unique style of playing the clichés and acknowledging them for being just that. Though the show is almost stolen by Jack Palance as the initially uncompromising trail boss.Possibly my favourite film of all time.",City Slickers
77,marshalllancaster-95185,6.7?,9,10 July 2020,6.7 is ludicrous! This movie is special. The characters really grow on you. It is coming of age for 40-somethings. Great messages about life.,City Slickers
78,LucasHorne,You don't have to like Westerns to enjoy this!,7,20 January 2019,"In the early 90's the Western genre was making a comeback, and it seemed like everyone was jumping on the bandwagon. So to have a comedy of 3 city mouse going out to the country and dealing with an out of place comedy, it was gold.The main thing was the chemistry from all the actors, with some stellar performances which even landed a Oscar Win for Supporting Actor. The beauty is, that it wasn't a parody so that you don't have to be a fan of the genre to get the jokes. This makes it more entertaining for everyone watching it, and because of that it holds really strong. I'm a fan of Billy Crystal, and his comedic timing in this movie was right on point for him. Giving a fun and entertaining performance, for all viewers.My rating of a 7 is mainly because this movie is in all aspects a popcorn movie, this was made to be enjoyed with a group of friends with a big bowl of popcorn laughing at the hijinx on the screen. It is still considered a great movie many years later, and some of the jokes are still used as well. I highly recommend this movie for the whole family, and again you don't have to be a fan of the Western genre to really enjoy this movie.",City Slickers
79,annacleitner,"Fun movie, AWFUL cinematography",6,27 May 2021,"The movie itself is fun and well meaning, and Billy Crystal is SUPERB! However, the cinematography is simply atrocious. The camera couldn't stop moving. Would've been a 7 if not for the distraction of the visuals.",City Slickers
80,kstaj,goof,3,19 August 2005,"at the very beginning of the movie, when they are at the running of the bull, the guys are running like mad and a guy walks in front of them, kinda ducking out of the way of the camera!! the rest of the movie is good. it's been along time since I have seen this, but the guy ducking under the camera (even though you can see him) just ruined it for me. I think that if they couldn't see it, they must be BLIND!! I mean it is SO obvious!! I couldn't watch that movie and feel anything other than the amateur way they dealt with that It was a good story though and there were lots of laughs, and the calf (Norman) is just TOO CUTE!!I think that the picked the right guys for the parts and I just loved Jack Palance, I cannot imagine any other actor in this part",City Slickers
81,acegerard,No Movie in History Contains More Elements of Outstanding Movie!,9,30 May 2013,"City Slickers is my all-time favorite movie because it contains more of and all necessary elements for a great movie. Action, drama, comedy, good triumphs over evil, humility, irony, satire, relationships between men-men, men-women, generations, human-animal, human-nature, you name it, and to boot it provides awesome natural scenery. Please tell me any other movie in history - yes in all mankind universal history, that covers more? And I'm not even a huge Billy Crystal fan, although I like him and most of his work. Daniel Stern, no one comparable! And the rest of the cast and and crew, producer and director all top performance. What can we say about Jack Palance, initials JP = JUST PERFECT!",City Slickers
82,discopunk,The Big Little Movie,10,29 April 2004,"This is one that I think every guy should see at least once. I could really relate to the character of Mitch's questioning his job, and wondering what he should be doing with his life. I thought the movie frankly starts out with a rather serious mood, relaxed by the characters joking about their situations, but I liked that a lot. It makes you think about how heavy the responsibility of providing for a family really can be. The humor is totally great in this film as well. Crystal especially had me laughing all the time. And as others have said, it kind of surprises you how the story gets pretty emotional down the stretch. Almost cried, but not quite. I just watched it for the first time last weekend, gave it a 10, and look forward to watching it many times in the future.",City Slickers
83,winbob57,City Slickers,10,31 January 2007,"This is one of my all time favorite movies. The story is wonderful and the humor is outstanding. It has some incredible lines in the movie that I always come back to. It is a very meaningful story with many life touching events. Billy crystal is one of my favorites. Stern is excellent as well as all of the main cast. I have watched the movie at least 10 times and use it as a feel good movie. I highly recommend this movie. The second movie has entertainment value, but for my money it doesn't come close to the first one. I really loved the music also. This is a great family movie and is good for all ages. One of my favorite parts is when they talk about their best and worst day. It is both serious and funny. That's what I like best about the movie. It is Happy, Sad, Funny and touching. Happy viewing.",City Slickers
